The US spends $800 billion each year on their military. Over 50% of these funds are acquired by the printing press. Much of these funds end up in the pockets of military contractors and other weapons manufacturers.

There will be wealth inequality in a bitcoin world, but bitcoin will be flipping the current demographics upside down.
Currently, most wealth is held by trust-fund babies, bankers, huge conservative institutions, and CEOs. 
In a bitcoin world, you'd see wealth be transferred to hundreds of thousands of investigative journalists, engineers, computer programmers, activists, and small businessmen. Remember: Many early adopters heard about and researched bitcoin due to WikiLeaks, the silk road, and alternative (anti-status quo) online media.
You would feel a great unseen redistribution of power as the priviledge of the printing press is taken away from a small oligarchy and we return to honest money. Many corrupt institutions relying on this connection to the printing press would shrivel up and fade away. The housing market (and rents) would probably crash and stabilize at a more sustainable and equitable level, and you would see a rush of private investment into *progress* instead of perpetuation of the status quo.
Also, if bitcoin ever goes mainstream (even 5-10% adoption), and you're holding 5 or 10 BTC or more, then you would be included in the new "top 1%".

**You are the market.** You **chose** to keep your money with gox months after they suspended USD withdrawals and their price was over 10% disconnected from all other functioning exchanges.
You were also warned time and time again of keeping your bitcoins "safe" with 3rd parties, and that you were entrusting strangers with your life savings when doing so.
You also had the choice of going to  (which I've personally spammed on for newbies) and thus would be exposed to no 3rd party risk, and it would've cost you 5 minutes and a total of $0.10 worth of paper and ink.

It is a thought experiment and hasn't been put into practice yet.
I assume a private key would be issued to each person (with photo ID), and 1 votecoin issued per election (to the individual's public key). Votecoins would decay after 24 hours (so they cannot be accumulated), and public keys would be offered for each issue during the election.
The blockchain would be transparent for counting/fraud detection.
-The # of votecoins would always match the # of people in the given area.
-The only way fraud could occur is if people are not receiving their votecoins. (thus the corrupt parties would be able to "steal" their votes without showing additional votes on the blockchain)
This would require near 100% participation (at least in signing up/monitoring your address) and one must also assume the official population figures are not overstated.

It will plateau eventually, but I have read articles stating that standard 3.5" HDD platters should be able to theoretically store up to 20TB.
Therefore, a home PC could manage up to 80TB of data, or about 16,000% more than today's average PC (500gb). The blockchain increases about 10GB a year currently. Even at a 100x increase (1TB per year), it would still take 80 years to fill the storage of that home PC.
Block propagation may be an issue before blockchain size becomes an issue. A 1GB block would take ~750 seconds to download on my connection, or more than 10 minutes. See the problem?
A 1GB block would contain ~2.8 million transactions. If 500 million people are using bitcoin for everyday purchases, then this wouldn't be abnormal.

As it stands now, we use a massive amount of credit on otherwise useless projects/pursuits. (See: Treasury bonds, credit cards, home equity loans, student loans)


Inflation makes credit more expensive (inflation is added into the rate), and deflation is the opposite (deflation is subtracted from the rate). But I do see your point.
I don't think we'll ever again see the levels of economic growth that we saw during the late 1800s and most of the 1900s. The growth was attributed to the proliferation of electricity, the automobile, and most recently computers/internet. Everything else was inflation mixed with population growth.
Honestly there is nothing wrong with 1-2% growth, especially if it isn't built on inflation/debt.

Look at the innovation within bitcoin compared to the innovation within normal society, or worse...the government! There is reason to believe that this trend will only accelerate as the bitcoin price increases, opening up more opportunity for this demographic. I personally am working on 3 different businesses at the moment (two I would consider innovative and beneficial to the greater commmunity), and if bitcoin went to $5,000, I would probably start work on 1-2 more, because I would then have the capital to do so.


I will give you my own personal story - I learned about bitcoin in 2011, on an anti-government forum and thus due to my anti-government beliefs. I invested in mid-2012. I have **never** earned an income higher than the poverty level (US) and have held manual labor jobs my entire life. Bitcoin has already granted me wealth, freedom, and opportunity that I would've had to literally slave away for (while diligently saving) for over a decade.
The very first people I reached out to with the knowledge and potential of bitcoin were various established (leftist) activist and charity organizations within my local area. I continue to reach out to well-run local small business and other individuals who are self-driven and passionate. I assume many others do the same.
(Also note - considering you're posting here and most likely bought around the $100 mark...you yourself are considered an "early adopter".)


If you are investing money successfully, then your investment is most likely productive to the greater whole of society. Even if you are buying rental property to become a slum-lord (one of the lowest forms of capitalism), then you're still pushing up the real estate market and thus sending a market signal to real estate developers to produce more residential property.
What this debate ultimately boils down to is this: who do you feel should run society? Priviledged men in suits (politicians/judges/lobbists) whom you do not know or have contact with? (because after all, political power is the highest form of priviledge)
...Or perhaps no one at all? Could we return to a meritocracy, letting the chips (bitcoin) fall where they may?
I understand how it is comforting to feel the need for a singular organization to take the reigns of society and lead us, *but the concept fails for the very same reason you fear a decentralized society would fail - greed and laziness.* 
For a centralized (political) system to achieve progress, the top of the pyramid must do the work, must guide the rest of the pyramid. For a decentralized system to achieve progress, any sufficiently capitalized actor within the community can independently achieve societal progress - without permission. It is inevitable that such progress will take place, and in a short time frame. This is in contrast to our current system, where those of us who are altruistic and forward thinking must beg again and again to the levers of power to make a change - and yet they do nothing...**for decades!** This is due to the very same characteristics you fear - *greed and laziness*.
Trust each other; trust the universe; trust anarchy.

...there is not enough innovation in the bitcoin space? lol. And yes, as far as the core protocol is concerned, I want it to remain mostly unchanged (stable).
Keep in mind that in 2011 there was Bitcoin-Qt, Mt.Gox, and maybe a dozen independent merchants. I don't think the space is stagnating just yet, and you must remember that there are several hundred (or thousand?) projects outside of the core protocol.

Correct. And they're not the source of social order or progress either. Order and progress come from all of us - some more than others, obviously. (For an extreme example: An engineer at Google vs someone on welfare. This is why "income equality" is dangerous. It destroys progress.)
In fact, a handful of humans hell-bent on disorder can destroy an an entire community. Look at ghettos as an example. 90% or more of the community is peaceful, and yet the violent 10% cause a persistent sense of disorder.

According to  there are ~45,000 BTC currently for sale on every major exchange worldwide.
The average ask price for these is ~$700 per coin, therefore $32,000,000 would buy up every single bitcoin for sale on every exchange worldwide, sending the price to over $2,000 per coin. $32M is 0.00357% of the assets these banks have under management. 
If the banks put 0.01% of their assets into bitcoin, we could realistically be looking at over $10,000 per coin. If they invested 0.1%, then we could see prices as high as $50,000 or $100,000

Widespread adoption results in price increases. Not everyone can own a full bitcoin (or even 0.1 BTC), therefore the price must increase.
Price increases actually *increase* the usefulness of the currency. It creates more liquidity and allows the large players (Business to business transactions) to conduct commerce. The market cap couldn't support it otherwise - a single large transaction could require 10% of the total currency supply, such as when the market cap of bitcoin was under $50 million.

Inflation is always a key component of interest rates, because the creditor is losing X% per year due to it.

You can print one QR and different address per table, then each table deposits their funds. You can add up the # of transactions on blockchain.info to see if everyone has paid. If the funds/transactions are short at any given table, then someone is lying about making their transaction, and you may have to check their mobile app to confirm payment and/or resolve the situation.
Your solution sounds reasonable - You write the restaurant a check after all the bitcoin funds are in your coinbase. They may be afraid of the check bouncing, however. (USD problems) Are they happy with accepting your check? If not, bring cash instead, and keep the bitcoin that your guests are sending.

For smart contracts, I'd imagine the best way to release funds would be via a specific digital signature by the person owing payment. There is no other reliable way for software to "know" an abstract task has been completed. (I may be wrong?)

Certain people will become very wealthy, yes. But what is more important is the change caused in the power dynamics, most notably the ability to generate infinite amounts of currency (and thus cash-flow) to command an army of people.
Satoshi has zero cash-flow, and therefore is slowly burning through his coins. Due to this fact, it wouldn't really make sense for him to fund a giant military or oppressive police state, nor would it make sense for *anyone* to do this.

Want me to calculate this?
I'll post in and .
EDIT: [According to this article]( there are currently 93,000 bank branches in the US.
For **Air conditioning** let us assume each bank branch has [this AC unit:]( at 5kw, and uses it 20% of the time, 50% of the year. 5kw * 24 * 0.2 * 0.5 * 365= 4,380 kwh x 93,000 = **407 GWh per year.**
We will estimate **lighting** at 6 of [these fixtures]( on 12 hours per day. 360 * 6 * 12 * 365/1000 = 9,460 kwh * 93,000 = **880 GWh**
**Computers** are about the same. A bank branch will have 6 computers on at any given time, with ~300w used by the tower and another 60 by the monitor, working out to be 360 * 6 * 12 * 365/1000 = 9,460 kwh * 93,000 = **880 GWh**
This would make AC, computers and lighting add up to a staggering 2,167 GWh.
For **mining bitcoin**, [let us be fair and use the figure of 1w/GH]( since not everyone is using hardware that can achieve 0.7w/GH or lower yet. At 75 petahash, we're looking at 75MW of power. Mining hardware runs all day so: 75MW * 24 * 365 = **657 GWh**
2,167 GWh / 657 GWh = 3.3x more energy used by banks. 
This could be stated as bitcoin using 30.3% of the energy of US bank branches, or **69.7% less energy.**
If you include the entire financial system (corporate offices, call centers, stock/commodity/futures/forex markets, auditing, regulatory and compliance offices, etc), you would probably have to *at least* double energy consumption (in the US alone) and then quadruple that again for a worldwide figure. Therefore we could increase this estimate by (*very roughly*) 8x, making bitcoin mining consume **~3.79%** electricity compared to the existing global financial system, and this figure of 3.79% will be cut in half [in 114 weeks](
*[These figures do not include natural gas, gasoline from employee/customer commutes, or paper waste in their calculation]*

He made a public statement saying "oh hey! I stumbled upon an old paper wallet with $120 million in it!" After he claimed 100% of the coins were stolen by a hacker.

These projects are funded with a temporary increase of local property taxes - one of the last remaining revenue sources for the state.*

90% of the population has never independently invested in anything before, and their lives revolve around a mixture of fear and the need for verbal approval from a figure of "authority". 
You could be family or a friend; be a lifelong IT expert or programmer; have been telling them to buy for 12 months; showing endless charts; math etc....but until Jim Cramer or some other suit on the Wall Street Journal tells them to buy, they're not going to.
They're also looking for approval from their "peers", and when you're going on and on about the intricacies of mining pools and the blockchain, then I don't think they get this feeling.

Bandwidth would definitely be an issue long before that.
Bit torrent can have transfer speeds of 1-3 MB/s, but let's say 500kb/s due to less than ideal conditions. To have a healthy bitcoin network, you need a block propagation rate of under 2 minutes per node, therefore 120x0.5 = 60 MB block sizes before bandwidth limits start to strangle the network.
60MB blocks would be 420 transactions per second.
Eventually if bitcoin goes mainstream, only moderately fast servers will be capable of running full nodes. (Assuming Moore's law grinds to a halt)

They are! But the math has already been done hundreds of times before. People were posting calculations/predictions almost identical to this as early as 2011 when it was still under $5/coin. Hell, Satoshi probably did these calculations while he was writing the source code! After all, Satoshi is the ultimate hodler.

The US stock market is currently valued at $24T. Global gold supply is ~$12T. Bitcoin is $10B
So lets say bitcoin eventually plateaus at a value of 10% of gold and US stocks. That is 36,000B/10 = 3,600B total market cap. 
3,600/10 = a 360x increase from today's price, 360x600 = ~$216,000 per coin.
That is a modest prediction. An upper limit long-term (50 years) is over $2,000,000/coin, or in other words, about 15 houses (since at that point, the whole concept of USD will have lost all meaning)

I think what a lot of people don't realize is this: When lending in an inflation-proof currency, you have to greatly limit withdrawals(like CDs) and offer low interest rates, otherwise you'll never be able to fulfill the promises you make to depositors. 
I can see the free market interest rate for BTC loans being 2-5%, so depositors would get ~1-3%.
The Bitcoin financial system will be vastly different and simplistic compared to our current one. No one should expect it to operate like the USD system. After all, it was designed to be different!
Instead of trillions going into derivatives, mortgages, futures, stocks, etc...maybe capital will go into real, long term, physical projects and businesses which add value to cities and communities. All with stable debts and debt payments! One can dream, right?

He promised a 3,300% annual return for "investors" on the bitcointalk.org forums.
He quickly made a decent website which you could log into and check your balance and interest gains. A few months went by and he announced that he could no longer pay out the interest to his clients and that he was returning the BTC.
He never returned any BTC and no one heard from him again. Allegedly over $1,000,000 worth of BTC was entrusted to him.

of almost 97% of all owners was less than 10 BTC's. This number decreases
to 88% if instead of looking at one speci c moment, we look at the maximal
balance ever seen throughout an owner's lifetime. In addition, it can be seen that there are only 78 owners with current
balance larger than 10,000 BTC's. This number grows to 3,812 when looking at
the maximal balance ever seen.
I'd assume the 3,812 people were early miners...but if the number is now 78, this means the vast majority of them have already sold their initial stockpile. Why would so many miners choose to sell their BTC? Wouldn't they be interested in holding onto the coins and letting them appreciate, especially if they truly believe in the system?

A bank run in modern banks is not possible, due to the ability to generate unlimited amounts of new currency and liquidity. A bank run on bitcoins is more likely due to these safeguards not existing, and thus things like CoDs(where your money is inaccessible for X years) would be the most likely source of credit.

But why would someone intentionally do this? Even if **one** person or group controlled 20% of the BTC supply and hid 10% of the total supply, the other 10% they control would only appreciate by ~11%. It could take 1-5 years for the market to discover the new price, and when these hidden or stashed coins are released onto the market, the price will most likely fall and destroy their previous gains.
With that said, I doubt any one group will ever control 20%, and this kind of attempted market manipulation is already widespread in both stocks and currencies.

This is an issue of trust. Would you trust pirate to drive your car? No? Then why the hell would you hand over all of your BTC to him?! You people never even saw his face or looked into his eyes or shook his hand. So why did you trust him so deeply? Because he appealed you your **greed** and you seemed to have suspended all basic reasoning before handing over BTC to him.

But those bonds are held as assets somewhere by someone - mostly institutions.
The theory is that instead of holding an excessive amount of bonds, at least a percentage of this pie would be put into bitcoin instead. 10% of US treasuries would be $1.7 trillion, resulting in a ~42,500% increase in bitcoin prices, based on market cap.
Only 1% of only US treasury bonds would be a 4,250% increase, putting bitcoin at over $13,000 each.

In theory, when the blockchain becomes too large (in 10+ years), then yes.
I suppose they could set a date to create a "Solid State" copy of the blockchain, and the next block mined becomes the "genesis v2.0" block, so to speak. It would be a soft reset of sorts. But a vast majority of the miners would have to agree upon this in advance.

Also, the phrase illegal/illicit payments gives the impression that those people feel I shouldn't have control over my own funds, and I should be fined or jailed for moving my funds in a questionable manner. Essentially they are creating victimless crimes to prevent victimless crimes. Then, when they force businesses to police this behavior, they're creating a victimless crime to prevent victimless crimes to prevent victimless crimes.

TPTB bought in. My guess is in March/April 2013.
As long as they hold a healthy position in the asset, they'll allow its adoption. I would also guess this is why the Chinese government is upset. They're a bit later to the game, causing the November bubble, and likely getting their hands on far less coins than the Western elite did.

5. "They" don't want transparency. Never have.
6. It is border-less in that they can't control it.
7. No limit on # of addresses, and the addresses are not linked to a gov ID.
8. "They" don't know how to innovate, only kill and steal.
9. Bitcoin is viral, not marketed by corporate media or political leaders.
10. The government didn't have a clue about its existence or properties until earlier this year. The vast majority working in government still don't.
11. SDRs or carbon credits were and still are their intended oppressive global currency of choice.

The point is to **save** in BTC and then you can easily shop online with it, because you already own some. People initially acquire bitcoin to speculate on its price, then end up using it as a currency, as it is intended to be.

Therefore the government is able to systematically oppress people for decades using this stolen wealth, meanwhile Satoshi needs to create something of value with it if he wants to ever have the chance to see a return on his future "investments", whatever they may be.
Based on this, it is easy to conclude that deflation creates long-term wealth and productivity, inflation creates government oppression.

The thing is: Ripple relies too heavily on existing fiat, which is connected to the corrupt system that bitcoiners wish to rid themselves of (or at least be independent from).
XRP is also **80 percent** premined by "Opencoin inc" and was not even open source, until they decided to make it so due to lack of adoption.
To many, Ripple appears as a NWO alternative to Bitcoin, with bitcoin being far more revolutionary, egalitarian, and anti-state in nature. It is no surprise that bitcoin has much higher rates of adoption and community.
Perhaps this sheds some light on why Ripple is "dismissed".

Perhaps, but what if he uses a proxy on his bitcoin client? How do you find his real IP address? How do you know he still holds coins on that device? How do you successfully get a trojan on his PC? What if he keeps the vast majority in a paper wallet? Or on a series of paper wallets and devices? What if he uploads the encrypted wallets to a secure cloud service and USB drive, then deletes them off of his HDD? What if he encrypts and renames the files before uploading them, so you don't even know what is held within the archive, assuming you somehow had access to his specific cloud service to begin with?
You're essentially looking for an (encrypted) needle in a haystack, which can be hidden behind other passwords.

 If we continue to make advances for the next million years I think we will have surpassed and overcome scarcity, therefore bitcoin will be quite useless.

No. When withdrawing funds from 'paper' wallets, **you must always withdraw 100% of the balance.** Many mobile wallets will not even allow you to withdraw partial amounts from private keys for this very reason.

I think it is a conversation worth having, and several of his points/fears are valid and should be addressed.
With that said: many of us didnt come upon bitcoin by sheer luck - bitcoin came to us. Devs, miners, and the like came to programming, political, and philosophical forums to discuss the currency and what it may bring to the future.
The early adopters are early adopters due to their intellectual curiousity, skill sets, accomplishments, and their online presence. Many bitcoiners have personally reached out to intellectuals/scientists/businesses/coworkers they respect, and informed them of the potential of this new system.
Early miners will share their coin because quite simply, they dont know what future price or adoption will look like, as do none of us. As the price rises, they shed 10 bitcoin here, 10 there. They'll spend their coin, because this is its intended purpose.
Yes, bitcoin has the potential to change the world, be the largest wealth transfer ever, but no one knows if it will be. If you believe in chaos theory and spontaneous order, like many other bitcoiners, then you shouldnt be afraid of this future. You should embrace true change.
It sounds like you're afraid of freedom, or more accurately, *other people having freedom*.

Yes. If you've already earned it and did not commit a crime, why not?
The vast majority of "crime" related to bitcoin is gullible people buying into a scam (Bitcoin Savings &amp; Trust, LabCoin, inputs.io, a few exchanges), sending their coins there, then the creator of those scams simply disappears. **This** is where consumer protection needs to exist, because such behavior is fraud and theft. But the government isn't interested in consumer protection, they're interested in *government protection from bitcoin itself*. If this means damaging bitcoin users and businesses legally, then so be it. This is what we are currently seeing.

You are putting your trust in a random ASIC mining company(that has not yet shipped or proven to have a working physical product). This has been the folly of a great number of people in the past. Bitcoins themselves -as an asset- require no trust, and there are many well trusted exchanges.

The strangest thing about this: We've seen the failure of the USSR *in our lifetimes*, and there are plenty of Soviet immigrants who've fled from there and are more than happy to tell you about the living conditions.
My friend's mother emigrated in the 1990s. The first time she saw a grocery store, she wept, because she'd never have to live off of potatoes or worry about going hungry again.

It is a good analogy. They're both stores of value. The main differences between the spikes:
1. The gold market was suppressed by government for 50 years.
2. Bitcoin didn't exist prior to 2009.
The big difference is that bitcoin is arguably a far better store of value (since it can be moved and divided so easily). It is also 500x rarer. Therefore bitcoin's spike should be much **much** larger.

The US government is wholly incompetent, outside of a bunch of military research subcontractors.
Bitcoin was more than likely invented by google, microsoft, or even some lone pissed off talented programmers who saw opportunity knocking after the 2008 financial crisis. Satoshi was likely working on the software for a couple years prior to 2008.
The reason you didnt hear much about it until 2013 is because you werent browsing the proper forums. It was all rolled out through clever digital word-of-mouth, to maximize societal disruption of course.
Another thing that puts a dent in your theory is that SR operated for over 2 years without a problem. Therefore, if bitcoin takes off, forward thinking tech savvy drug dealers will be among the richest people in the world, next to programmers and anti-government libertarians.
Oh, and did I mention how bitcoin takes away the governments power to print money and will increase tax evasion?
Does this scenario make it sound like everything is going according to the government's master plan? If this is their plan, then they're even dumber than I thought.

Yes you do. How do you expect to pay people in bitcoin, when you don't own any bitcoin?


You would still be required to pay payroll tax, I'd imagine. Otherwise your employees could be unemployed according to the state, and you can pay them "under the table" in bitcoin. This is technically tax evasion and illegal, but it is already a fairly widespread practice with cash. The owner simply says: "I'm going to pay you in cash, okay?" Both parties get to remain tax-free, and thus have no incentive to tell the authorities of the arrangement. 
What would be less illegal, would be to pay your employees minimum wage on the books, and pay the remainder of their salary off of the books in bitcoin. If you are ever audited by the IRS, this practice would/could cause some issues. **Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer**


It doesn't. Bitcoin is 100% independent from all banking and government institutions, which is why many people love it.

What you were taught about the great depression was a lie.
The federal reserve tripled the money supply from 1913 to 1930, and caused the great depression. This is why they had to revalue gold to $35 per ounce, and why the stock market boomed before it crashed.
It is funny how you equate our modern economy with "stability" and "no inflation". *"But $1 is always worth $1!"* Duh, you can't compare the value of something to itself. But $1 is worth 1/1500th of an ounce of gold. If the masses still saved in gold, it would be worth 1/10,000th an ounce of gold. 100 years ago, at the dawning of modern agriculture, rice sold for 3 cents per pound. If we truly had "no inflation", rice would be 1 cent per pound or less, due to continuing productivity in shipping and farming machinery.

Why should currencies be stable?
When the price is high, there is excess savings(spend!)
When the price is low, there is excess spending(save!)
When you create a bond/CD market, then these market movements are transferred to interest rates, but ultimately the same forces apply.
Also, the currency instability of BTC is from the adoption of a brand new technology/asset class.

To whom? The government is absolutely rife with fraud, waste, and corruption. Meaningless statements like these is only out of fear that the government's income stream may shrink over time, and some useless overpaid egotistical bureaucratic administrators may be out of a job.
You say we pay taxes to "society", yet there is an **army** of publicly funded administrators of our banking/financial system whose existence has been *entirely replaced* by a 10MB computer program.(bitcoin)
In the private sector this would almost immediately result in layoffs and lower costs for the end consumer, but the government is incapable of firing people and lowering taxes, and thus the institution becomes one of oppression and not of service. 
This process of moral and financial decay within the public sector has been happening for decades. Bitcoin is the stake through the heart of the vampire.

Gold I suppose, but BTC is rather easy as well.
Step 1) Buy bitcoins
Step 2) Encrypt wallet with a huge password(20+ characters)
Step 3) Put wallet on a USB drive.(or two) It would even fit on a floppy, haha. Hide the drives like you're hiding your gold.
Step 4) Delete your entire BTC folder if you feel that the computer in question could become compromised with a virus in the future. Even if infected and your wallet is stolen by a hacker, it could take months (or years) to brute-force hack your password.

If, say, your encrypted wallet had a password ~35 characters long...how secure would it be, even if your computer and wallet was compromised?

In the client...
"File --&gt; Backup Wallet"
Save it on your USB.
Done. It even fits nicely on an old floppy disk.
Then if you are really paranoid, you can delete your wallet.dat file in your App Data/Roaming/Bitcoin folder. After you do that, starting up your client will generate a fresh wallet, and your long-term savings is safely stashed away on one or more flash drives. You can even backup your wallet on a cloud service, but make sure it is encrypted with a very long password, 20-30+ characters.

"Collapse" does not happen overnight. It is all about the exchange rate. 
If we keep up these 10x annual increases in the bitcoin price, then historically it would appear as though the USD is currently collapsing in comparison to bitcoin.
If the USD is still around and you still pay taxes in USD, but bitcoin is ubiquitous and worth $250k each, then did the USD collapse or not?
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:35:32
Then that transaction leads to more USD, ultimately pushing bitcoin's price higher.
Bitcoin going up several hundred percent from here is inevitable. It is only a matter of time. The real question is where it stabilizes. $1000, $10,000, or $100,000?

You can't assume that deflation will occur at 0.5% forever. Eventually the economy reaches an equilibrium of product production and consumption. Our current high "growth" levels reflect inflation and population growth more than growth in wealth, production, or efficiency. I suppose the 3rd world is experiencing these high growth rates, but this is mainly due to modernization and the influx of new technologies, and will ultimately plateau.
In fact, wealth shouldn't be measured in GDP or income per capita at all. If you build an entire neighborhood, once the work is done your GDP and income drops to zero, but aren't you *wealthier*? Everyone has their own house. GDP is more or less a measurement of how many times currency changes hands, oftentimes in an economic circle-jerk fashion.
Also, when does bitcoin's inflation rate drop below 1%? 2030? The only reason we are experiencing "deflation" right now is because of the limited supply of bitcoin relative to new demand.

Any plans for transfering/flashing non-zero address balances to a fresh blockchain in a sort of soft reset? This would be an excellent solution for the longterm storage scalabilty problem regarding the size of the blockchain.
Obviously it would require extensive testing and isnt really necessary for at least several years. And miners/users would need to know when said event will happen in advance. You could model it after the pre-existing automation of difficulty adjustments.
I would imagine this to be an easier solution than off-chain transactions. (Disclosure- I cant write code)

The **Federal** government. I'm not sure how this could be any clearer. Each state also has its own constitution, laws, legislature, and executive.
Either way, contracts between individuals is one of the most private things in society. Why should/would the federal government ever be allowed to have power over such matters?

The more likely scenario would be to give your bitcoin depositors a certificate of deposit (IOU), then lending out the real bitcoin to people seeking loans.
There is no FDIC so you would have to be very careful, and would have to offer a significantly higher % yield than today's rates. Also bitcoin's exchange rate would have to stabilize.

Government operations are about as "public" as Exxon Mobil's (meaning you have NO say or influence over the process).

Bitcoin isn't "aiming" to do anything. It is just a piece of computer software, and thus has no intention. 
This discussion doesn't matter. None of it matters. Bitcoin will do what it wants, regardless of your opinion or the opinion of the establishment.
Individuals owning bitcoin will use their bitcoin how they see fit, and individuals will continue to acquire bitcoin based on its benefits over USD/EU/CNY or gold. [Welcome to anarchy!](

During the cooling process of the earth, these heavier metals slowly sank down into the molten metal, to the core of the earth where they still sit today. 
Then, billions of years later after the earth cooled, asteroids containing metals such as gold and platinum crashed into the earth depositing these metals into the crust. Hence their rarity compared to lighter metals such as copper and iron.
tl;dr: Gold and platinum contained in the Earth's crust come from asteroids.

Their perspective involves destroying several key features of bitcoin via:
1. Centralization
2. Destruction of fungibility and therefore trade
3. Ability to be seized (declared "dirty") by a centralized party, seemingly arbitrarily based on what we know
4. Arbitrary declaration of dirty coins without due process removes property rights almost entirely. Even if you play their game, there is no guarantee they won't simply add your coins to the blacklist if you upset the state, for past or present behavior.
5. Removing independence from businesses and individuals alike.
So yes, I would say their perspective is invalid with bitcoin. If they don't like it, they are free to cash out and use USD.

Buy an old laptop with a fresh copy of windows XP, and only install bitcoin-qt on it.
Encrypt a wallet in bitcoin-qt, and string 2+ passwords together. (Five 5-character passwords would be one 25 character password) Each "member" gets one X character password. Then, when making a transaction, each person takes turns -in the correct order- putting in their section of the password, and you're good.
You could only make a transaction if everyone is present and agrees to it, of course...but isn't that the point?
Each person could also have a backup of the wallet file, yet cannot spend the coins on it. They can also remotely check the balance using a blockchain.info bookmark.

This would result in lower interest rates than our current model as well, since inflation is a component of interest rates.
Also, fraudulent debt such as treasury bonds and municipal bonds soak up a very large portion of bond demand, leaving less available for legitimate debts such as mortgages and small business loans. This in turn leads to higher rates for those types of debts.

The government will likely "default" through inflation.
If it prints up all $17 trillion of debt, this would approximately triple the US money supply, thus sending gasoline to ~$12 per gallon. Housing may not have the same increases since everyone will have lost a significant amount of their wealth.
This is likely to occur over time, not all at once, so expect steady 5-10% inflation over the next 10-20 years.

How would 2008 have been resolved in a bitcoin economy?
By allowing those who made stupid risky bets to default or take the losses.
The OP's point was that in today's fiat system, the rich are almost guaranteed 6-8% returns without risk, because the government is always there ready to bail out whomever, or inflate stock prices. 
Meanwhile, the working class struggle to pay their bills as housing and the cost of living become increasingly unaffordable.

If adopted, it will have the effect of massively boosting the wealth (100-1000x) of the programming, entrepreneurial, tech-savvy activist, and various academic demographics, thus leading to a boom in innovation across all walks of life.
It will cripple the current financial system, making entire industries obsolete, such as accounting, bank branches, payroll departments, regulatory compliance, regulatory agencies, etc.
It will cause massive globalization via the weakening of national currencies, national stock markets, and elimination of capital controls.
We will see the emergence of a global currency with a global stock market, which is anonymous, automated, and tax-free.
Bitcoin will empower millions(or someday billions) of people worldwide, while pulling power away from various governments by reducing the ability to tax commerce and inflate national currencies.

 As a "libertarian" of sorts, I encourage holding the majority of your coins because if you spend/sell them all at $10, $100, $1000, then they're far more likely to end up in the hands of the very same power structure most of us are fighting against. We'll end up being ruled by the same people, and the true potential of the bitcoin revolution will have been severely diminished.

Blockchain.info isn't the blockchain. It is a website named after it.
Your private keys are stored in a file called wallet.dat in the User/AppData/Roaming/Bitcoin folder. The blockchain is also contained in the same folder. (if you are running Bitcoin-Qt)
If your wallet is encrypted with a strong password, then most malware (besides keyloggers) will be unable to access your coins, even if they have unauthorized access to your PC.
Paper wallets are unencrypted, but you can make an encrypted QR code using certain android apps. Encrypted QRs haven't been standardized by industry yet, but I'd imagine this is only a matter of time, then encrypted paper wallets could/would be common.
The  risk of losing coins is simply forgetting your password.
The  risk is hard drive failure without having a backup of your wallet.dat on a flash drive or in the cloud.
The  would likely be reusing username/passwords across dozens of websites, thus allowing hackers to gain access to 3rd party hosted wallets such as blockchain or coinbase

Federal taxation rates were 0% until 1913. It was weak but it never "failed", whatever that means.
Where does the constitution say the federal government is allowed domain over private contracts? This is the discussion at hand. I will once again refer to the 9th and 10th amendments.
Notice you **assume** that since the constitution does not explicitly say *"The Federal government shall have no jurisdiction over private contracts"*, that somehow they have full authority over such. Thankfully, the founders wrote the 9th amendment to stave off illogical and nefarious arguments such as this, but you'll likely dismiss it anyway.
From wikipedia: 




You don't think that the liberty to write and enter into contracts voluntarily is held under these natural rights? If the government is able to "regulate" contracts, then they can force a clause onto them requiring you surrender rights / privacy / property to the state. Do you really think the founders intended the Federal Government to have this power? Or are you simply suggesting another massive power-grab based on the lack of explicit prohibitions in the constitution? (as if the founders didn't write enough prohibitions already)
@_date: 2013-12-24 19:52:51

It is far too early to conclude whether bitcoin will be a positive or negative force on the world.
I firmly believe it will be an overwhelmingly positive one, personally. A sizable portion of wealth is now in the hands of activists, engineers, etc, and it is set to continue to grow in an exponential manner. At the same time, bitcoin weakens the state, which in many ways is the institution that perpetuates poverty and war.

Black is hot White is neutral, only the link 110 volt AC to 110 volt AC. Always wire outlets in parallel back to the circuit breaker. Switches are placed in order to break the parallel circuit of whichever outlet you want it to work upon. 220v ac must originate from its own fuse on the circuit breaker. Same rules apply but with different outlets and a larger gauge wire.

Early 2011: GPU mining software is released.
March 2011: Bitcoin passes $1
July 2011: The bubble of 2011, the likely cause being a wave of media attention about the existence of "The Silk Road". The price peaked at $30
July 2011: The CIA invited a few bitcoin developers to a private meeting at the Pentagon.(?)
Early 2012: Various hacks, including Bitcoin Savings and Trust (PirateAt40), a Mt.Gox hack and others. 
Mid 2012: BFL Pre-orders begin.
Late 2012: ASICMiner IPO at 0.1 BTC
Late 2012: First Avalon ASICs hit the market

April 1st 2013: Bitcoin receives its first television air-time on MSNBC/Fox Business
April 2013: Price peaks at $260, market cap at $2 billion +

Guess who else can seriously do them harm? The grocery stores they supply. In fact, grocery store executives came to the plant to inspect our processes on multiple occasions.
The only person inspecting your computer/smart phone/etc before it ships out is the QC department of the manufacturing company. No USDA or other government agency is involved. And I think smart phones are a bit more advanced than mass produced food.
Another example: KnCMiner had some big issues with their boards overheating/capacitors burning out. Do you think they're actively working on the issue, or are they saying *"fuck it, we aren't spending an extra $1 per board on better capacitors or the few thousand on R&amp;D in order to fix the issue"*?

lol. You think the late 1800s were a "highly dominated society"? There was no war on drugs, no standing army, no income tax, and no regulations. Electricity, the internal combustion engine, railroads, mass production, the radio, and the telephone were all being invented and brought to market by private individuals. Only one income per household was required to afford a house, a car, and a comfortable lifestyle. Families could financially afford to have 6 children without the mother having to work for extra income. Does this sound oppressive? Domineering? Keep in mind, the US also gained the reputation of "The Land of the Free" during this time, so much so that it still lingers on today.
Also, capitalism is based on voluntary trade, meaning all of the oppressive robber barons acquired their wealth through mutually beneficial transactions. Otherwise the transactions would have never occurred.
Anyway, if that is what you truly believe, then maybe you shouldn't buy bitcoin. It is meant to bring back the gilded age (or truly bring us into the digital age, if you prefer)

If you spend 100 BTC on mining hardware, you're in *debt* 100 btc and haven't truly "made" a dime until you've mined **at least** 100 btc. With these constant difficulty increases and the future reward halving, some people will never recoup the cost of the hardware.
Sad but true. I guess mining is more fun than simply buying a few dozen coins and sitting on them...?

No. You will not have your bitcoins available on demand while still earning interest. This is a feature of our current system that is immune to bank runs and where banks can be bailed out with an endless amount of 0% interest cash.
Bitcoin Banks must be far more conservative in their investments and restrict access to deposits using CODs. 
Getting a steady return on your money will be harder in the bitcoin world once it reaches maturity. This is due to the noninflationary aspects of the currency. Depositors fighting for a yield on their savings will also push interest rates far below rates that we are used to. Possibly to 1 or 2%. However, the credit market of bitcoin will only arrive and thrive once bitcoin adoption has slowed and the price stabilizes, most likely somewhere between $10k and $50k per coin, approximately in the year 2020 or 2025.

If you're the author of this blog, I have a question:
Are you a bank manager? I'm not understanding why you're arguing for fractional reserve banking. It causes inflation, instability, bank runs, etc. etc.
Like it or not: Bitcoin will reduce the *entire* financial system down to its proper non-fraudulent size. I'm estimating that the entirety of the financial industry -bank branches, corporate offices, stock market, hedge funds, mutual funds, insurance, 401k, etc-  may one day (2030) be about the size of the auto industry in terms of institutional profits.

To put it another way...
We can exponentially graph this and estimate the slope near the height of the curve. 
[log(50000/150)/(12 * 10)=4.8% per month](
The function would be y=150*2.718(e)^0.048x (x=months)
The slope of the tangent line at 108 months(9 years) is 1283, or $1283 per month.
MEANING: If you buy and hold at $150, then your investment 9 years from now will be appreciating at 1283/150=*855% per month!*
If you bought at $15, it would be appreciating at **8,550% per month**, and at $5...***25,650% per month!*** $1000 worth of bitcoin in 2011 could **appreciate** $256,500 per month in 2022.

They've already increased the blocksize limit.
There are plans to increase it to 10MB, or 40,000 transactions per block.
Someday, it could be increased to 50 or 100MB per block, but then only servers may have the bandwidth and storage to run full nodes. 100MB = 400,000 transactions per block, much closer to VISA.

US stocks: $25 trillion
US bonds: ~$20 trillion
US dollars: $10 trillion
US household debt(considered an asset): $52 trillion
US total: $107 trillion
To generalize, you could assume that the US holds 1/5 of the worlds wealth.
Therefore, approximately $535 trillion worth of "assets". Currency = $50 trillion + $10 trillion in precious metals
1% of assets = ~$500,000 bitcoin
1% of currency = ~$55,000 bitcoin

There is one giant flaw to your reasoning:
Wealth is based upon production capacity, not "money". All of our current productive capacity will still exist. Therefore, everyone will still have the same amount of material wealth, even if the average life savings is 0.001 BTC.
You also say the "earlies" do nothing with their funds. Why? Don't you think a creative, forward-thinking, scientifically and technologically inclined population would be working **harder** now that they've come upon all of this wealth and potential? 
If the "earlies" are doubling or tripling production capacity while working to reduce fossil fuel usage, then even those people with a few millies as their live savings would in fact be far better off in this new world.

Yeah i am still trying to figure out this copy+paste thing...
And what happens when it does.become mandatory? Oh well, fork it all?

I remain forever fascinated by the average person's mental and emotional attachment to USD.

The joke is on you: PaulKrugman is projected to increase another 200% in value this year. 
I'm currently 75% in PaulKrugman and 25% in Tesla.

So your saying satoshi was day-trading?

So? People were paid well to build those estates. The picture of two poor families could've been taken anywhere (IE: Cherry picking). I live in a working-class home built in 1910 and it is beautiful. Indoor plumbing, electric, radiator heat, 3000 sq feet.


lol. ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION WASN'T INVENTED YET. The electric motor wasn't invented yet!!! *Kings did not have washing machines! They had servants.* 
Also, the poor did have mops and brooms... What a lousy statement.
As for running water, plastic wasn't invented yet and steel was still expensive. **Capitalists** invented mining machinery and massively increased iron mining and production, making iron plumbing affordable and widely available.

Also: How much gasoline and resources does the current monetary system force individuals to waste?

I think it is safe to say - bitcoin [doesn't behave like your average asset.](
@_date: 2013-09-05 02:51:02
Survive? Yes. Prosper? I'm not so sure...
If/when entire towns are reduced to rubble and people are fighting over food and gasoline, I don't think cryptocurrency speculation will be high on the list of priorities.

This is a bit sexist. She's definitely intelligent and very productive as well.

I doubt they're reporting their sales to the IRS. These criminal scum should be behind bars.

Disagree all you want. It doesn't change his actual actions.

Yes, please.

You dont understand alternative currencies, but don't worry ,most people do not.
@_date: 2013-10-27 17:53:24


Yeah, having to exchange *money* for money? What a bunch of bullshit.

This has been discussed, and the consensus is that block propagation between Mars and the Earth will be impossible due to the speed of light being far too slow.
We would have to develop off-chain transactions for the Mars colony, or they would have their own separate blockchain that allows for interplanetary transactions.

I think he was being sarcastic.

They need to return to their classical roots. 
Example: Pay depositors 2%, make loans at 3-4%...make 1-2% profit (or whatever the free-market interest rates determine)
@_date: 2013-10-19 01:48:34
They cant. Bitcoin doesnt work like that. :)

Which is decreasingly effective as more people lose faith in the state.

Yes. Sink or swim.
Those who are self-employed or employed by the private sector wouldn't even notice, besides their bills shrinking and paychecks increasing.

Nay, interest is the only incentive, and rightfully so!

Why not both?

All good things come to an end. What a fucking joke. They will throw away every benefit that bitcoin has.
@_date: 2013-04-23 23:35:46
Woah woah woah, I'm a "mindless pumper", yet I've been interested in bitcoin since 2011.
Still waiting to get burned.
