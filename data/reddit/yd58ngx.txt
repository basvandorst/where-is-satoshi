It’s my inheritance not her retirement money. You know nothing of her circumstances yet you judge so blindly. And yet you have the nerve to call me stupid? Re educate yourself. Probably one of those bitter old guys who still hasn’t got a lambo ��

That was your boy not me.. I know my fleet of cars is worth 30% more than I paid for it, I even gave you an example of a cheap car that has rose over 300% in 3 years and I’ve put a thousand miles on it, if that’s not an investment what term would you use for it? Go check price rises of a Countach or a db5 for example if you still don’t get it.. I still stick by government bonds being a poor investment. And you’ve changed your mind, they’re now securities not investments?..  Haters gonna hate while I get caked. Have a nice day ��.

It means I buy a rare car that will go up in value, I can even drive it for fun while it makes me money.. I’ve been doing well so far so thanks for your concern but I don’t think I’ll get destroyed at all. I doubt you’ll live long enough to make this much of a return than I’ve made in last 5 years if you stick to your government bonds.

I overachieved, only started on 10th December though. Aimed for 10% compound growth a day. Smashed that got 18% a day. Was a good few weeks! 1000% roi within around 3 weeks I couldn’t be happier. Same target this year 10% growth a day, first million by Mach.

What an ignorant assumption. I helped my grandma reinvest into bonds last week, I was disgusted at how poor the interest rate was vs inflation. You really are loosing money in real terms. I believe the younger generation have so much information at our fingertips we don’t fall for these products.

Jheez how the hell did you get in there? You can’t even read, did I say I’d rather invest in crypto? I just said there are far higher returning investments. Hypothetically if gbp drops massively due to politics then holding gbp vs an appreciating vehicle which can be shipped globally would be better. (I bought a z3m 3 years ago for £8500, now worth £25,000, £10,000 of bonds would have returned £11,360.Now if I move and want euro I’d of been better off just buying euro 3 years ago than keeping my funds stuck in a low returning investment.) You can disagree with my logic saying this was more risky. I will disagree with that opinion.

I guess if you haven’t got the time/means/interest to find a better investment it’s better than your debit account.

That would be like saying all fiat goes to the government in terms of taxes. This is an economy, the money/bitcoin will keep circulating .

Haha I did advise against also but I disagreed with your roulette analogy, we all know the casino always wins but bitcoin the earlier you get in the better typically (unless you buy December aths and sell jan lol)

If you’re treating btc as a currency you need to refund/charge the same amount of btc, just like it would be the case if I ordered something in euros even though my native is GBP, if for some reason gbp had a massive change in value I would still settle with the euro value.

Don’t blame other people, it’s your mistake.. take it like a man, learn from it and move on. If you believed in it enough to buy then hold. If you think you made a stupid decision based on following other people, then don’t come here and ask more people what to do!

You do realise they were kicked out for not paying for the houses they were living in, and the banks were not given free money, they were issued loans to help prevent the collapse of the American economy. Banks may have offered credit where it shouldn’t have been, but they’re not solely responsible for the American citizens choice to get into debt they couldn’t afford.. I’m all for decentralisation but don’t play goodies and baddies.

Wow, it’s not a competition but if you want to make it one, why is bitcoin better than coins which are free and instant?
