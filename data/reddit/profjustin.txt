For the same reason a Ford has different styling than a Honda.  Different philosophies in product design.  Comic San is a Microsoft proprietary font - but I see your point.  Unfortunately no; with regard to fonts the one included with macOS High Sierra (Helvetica for example) might be different from the one included with Windows.  But Microsoft is a hemorrhoid - they tend to make proprietary stuff and act as if its an industry standard.  Then when other companies don't support it, the end user thinks the 3rd party is at fault.  
TLDR: no, different companies have different bullshit one must deal with.  Such is life.

This is where regulations step in to (theoretically) ensure they're not taking a shit.  If coinbase does take a shit, they would have to lie about their financials, in which case Mr. Armstrong would be in handcuffs.  So you see, certain rule and regulations are actually a good thing.

Thats what he has to find out.  Create the Swiss account, add it to the wallet service and do the transfer.  But I would suggest he do it with assistance from the bank because such a large sum is involved.
I use Coinbase, I'm assuming its a similar process.

IMO, nobody cares about guns and drugs.  Kiddie porn...  that's the Mccarthyism of the modern internet.  Remember SOPA?  CISPA?  legislators used CP as reasons for supporting it.  Neither had anything to do with CP.  Having said that, if the powers that be wanted to destroy BTC's reputation and get governments to restrict (ban?) BTC, all they have to do is get the mainstream media to link BTC with a kiddie porn ring.  Hell, maybe even link BTC with pizzagate.  If that happens, BTC will end.

I dunno...  After a decade in IT just when you think somebody's got it, they ask you how to convert an XLSX file to MP4.  Theys why accountants (like me) exist.  Any accountant who claims he can keep money away from the IRS is an absolute liar.  I'm in the car biz, I know a liar when I see one.

Sure.  I could also get fucked by the university's entire cheerleading squad.  Just because something is *possible*, doesn't mean it will happen.  
Here in the US we have a saying: straight outa left field!"  meaning "unexpectedly", "odd" or "strange."  Things rarely happen out of left field.  There's generally some sort of warning or to use another colloquialism "writing on the wall."  If Bitcoin is going to collapse, we'll see it coming.  Having said that, at present, Bitcoin is NOT an INVESTMENT.  It is a **gamble**.  Read that last line a few times.  You wouldn't bet your kids' college fund on a soccer game.  You wouldn't bet next month's rent on a baseball game.  If you're going to purchase BTC, do so with **disposable** income.

I agree most Bitcoin holders are probably techies. The problem is they don’t know anything about finance, foreign currencies, IRS regulations, or accounting.  So there are going to be a lot of people who lose a lot of money if things go sour very quickly.
 I’m not trying to insult anyone here, but that has been my experience. I spent almost a decade in Tech and then I went all business and accounting. And that is a major problem with engineers, doctors, techies, athletes, strippers and I’ll even throw in call girls…  they don’t know what to do with their money and often that gets them into trouble.   They won’t know when they’re being ripped off and they won’t know a good deal from a bad deal. And when they go to hire somebody to run their finances and invest their money, they may end up choosing somebody who is not reputable. That’s where reputation comes in and that is why these big companies are so big. Because of their reputation. For example Oppenheimer funds and Commonwealth Financial.   As always with any investment there is a certain amount of risk.

I said "kiddo" to be a wise ass, not to insult you.  I apologize if you took it as an insult.
My age: young enough to do it, old enough to know better.
I didn't suggest selling.  I said don't spend money you don't have.  What currency do you use to value your assets?  IMO using BTC is not appropriate; its like measuring how much your house costs in terms of shares of Lockheed.  **They may change**.  I work for a car dealership, and until this place takes BTC as payment for a new (or certified) 5-Series I can't consider it a serious contender as a currency.  **They may change** and I hope it does.  So for now the USD is what I use to value my assets.

Putting your life savings in BTC is a terrible idea.  At the moment BTC is a **gamble**.  I suggest you take at least 75% of that life savings and put it in conventional mutual funds etc and use the 25% as disposable income.

 Future CPA here…    Let me be very clear; it’s easier for your friend to comply with US tax laws then to run the risk of getting caught. If the transaction exists the IRS can in one way or another see it.  Your friend, Knorr you are wizards of money laundering an international wire transfers. Just obey the law and move on with your life it probably won’t be that big attacks anyway.
If it is a shit load of money, I suggest taking half of it and putting it into standard brick and mortar investments and let it a crew. I keep saying this; bit coin is a gamble for now. That could change. In the meantime he needs to treat his gains from bit coin as if they can disappear tomorrow.  Because quite honestly they can. Nobody knows what the future will bring especially with something as new as this.  Your friend needs to bite the bullet fill out a 1099 and move on with your life.

What do you want to look up our the capital gains tax rates.  
I know you see on the movies how financial wizards hide money in various places like Switzerland, Cayman Islands and Timbuktu; reality is the IRS goes to great lengths to make sure people are compliant. And if you make a mistake and they suspect you or your friend of having $80k in undeclared capital gains they can and will come after you. I know this for a fact.

EXACTLY!   He'll have to do it a bit at a time, or make a special arrangement with a BTD to cash service.  
However - I have another suggestion.  **Before he tells his wife**, he needs to find a service in Switzerland, create an account there and directly transfer a significant percentage of the BTC into that account.  It does not have to be an anonymous numbered account, just somewhere outside his home country (US I'm assuming).  The Swiss account **will be compliant with IRS regulations**, but **resistant** to US legal proceedings such as a divorce.  It will require a trip to Switzerland, will have to make an excuse to leave the country for a week or two. ** Go alone**.

Bitcoin was the first and people are used to it.  So often just being used to something is enough to prevent somebody from switching to something better. One example is windows versus Mac. People don’t want to change from Windows to macOS because of the learning curve. Even though once they make the switch their life would be so much better.  ������

I'll be a CPA soon, can I send you my resume?

I'm not joking about the naturist part.  I posed nude for art classes since I started college until last year when my schedule got too busy.  And...  I had a few students who drew me before I started teaching.  More awkward for them than it was for me.

Correct.  Thats why I want him to be **fully compliant** with every law.  I'm a future CPA, I can't advocate tax evasion.  Plus its simply too difficult and dangerous.

Those of us on Macs wouldn't understand.

Did you?  I'd rather go into a brick &amp; mortar bank where I can talk to somebody resembling a human.

More like *shit for brains*.
