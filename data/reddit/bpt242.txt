Buy the dip guys. Everyone has been in here doing the same ol wishing the price would drop. Well now is your chance. Take advantage. Buy low and if you sell then sell high
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:05:51
I wanted to drop this stuff a while ago so I get why people are being emotional but it is really not that bad. All the panic sells are what is going to make it worse. I can understand why bears or anyone who want to take advantage of how emotional people her in this space. This was honestly a small blip at best until people started freaking out and letting others who only come out of hiding to troll influence their choices.  Kind of wish that after you sold there was a mandatory wait period before you can buy back in. We have seen worse than this.  Weak hands need to sell and stay out of the market for their mental health. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 01:58:01
Bakkt will not get it's time in the sun. ETF news is too good for views and honestly over shadows Bakkt even though IMO Bakkt deserves the attention. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:06:18
No ETF will pass. This market is way too manipulated. Can people just get behind something else? 
@_date: 2018-08-04 19:26:13
Who is manipulating the price? 
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:49:16
We will keep buying and mining 
Not sure if any etf will come through but who cares . Fuck the trolls,banks and lazy click bait writers 
@_date: 2018-08-03 19:46:41
Well...think I need to buy in and hold. We need to buy and hold for awhile.   
Guess that guy who told me I would be back was right :/
@_date: 2018-08-01 02:26:25
Are things really that bad? This is still better than being stuck at 6K. Dont we have more news coming up next week on another ETF or was that next month? I keep trying to get out and getting sucked back in but I have to admit this is wayyyy better than they were. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 16:45:26
Does the night market =sell off time? Went to sleep at 7k and lol well ...
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:51:06
This is stupid. No one wanted any type of ETF let alone the SEC in anything  now instead of trying to keep things independent bitcoin is now dependent on the last people it should be dependant on ? I do want profit but to be honest Bitcoin won't be the currency of the people at this rate. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 00:58:13
Dude, we were on the way to 10 k what in the hell happened? Bears are having a field day -_-
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:22:39
6k bois 
@_date: 2018-08-01 02:27:02
Dude, no one wants you here go away. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:49:36
Is it bear time?
@_date: 2019-03-22 01:14:05
Wow...that dump was very bullish.  Twas hardly a scratch 
@_date: 2019-03-09 20:35:40
I am bearish as shit. Believe we are going to drop again but if you guys are willing to do the leg work with buying in hopes we push past 4k and stay there more power to you all. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 16:08:24
We can go much lower. 2000 to 1000
@_date: 2019-03-04 16:07:35
Not doomed. Limbo
@_date: 2019-03-08 22:57:30
Two more years of bear market
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:18:55
Just be careful with your funds. I was all in even wanted to farm hardcore and buy hardcore but...ugh... 
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:00:07
This is just sad. Is there ANY good news to look forward to? Every time we get head something happens lol. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:03:28
The dream is dead. I tried to believe for awhile but I am out. This market is controlled and FUD makes the rules. This is forever a bear's playground.  Either being told there is no point in mining and no there is not enough to the moon to keep throwing money at this without some stability. I want to be wrong but eh and I hate to sound like that never 10k guy who trolls here but Bitcoin is dead. To those who still have the stomach and the pockets to keep this up I wish you luck. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:54:49
I would like to mine but was told it was a terrible idea but thought Bitcoin needed miners. The whole buy buy buy thing is good for awhile but not everyone will hold. Not everyone will buy the dip lol. Every time news drops the panic sales are in full force. Forget reaching 20 k again I will be happy if Bitcoin can stay above 9000. At the most, 6 k or below might be honest to god worth of this currency. 
@_date: 2019-08-21 21:42:22
Why not? Just curious and wanted to gauge people thoughts.
@_date: 2019-08-21 21:30:40
Does anyone think that Bakkt will help out the price next month?
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:26:32
People are literally throwing their money away. Selling now is a waste but buying seems like a waste as well. The money will be left where it is but I have no idea where the faith comes from anymore. Crypto, in general, have been underperforming for a while despite the progress.
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:18:20
It be nice to be proven wrong trust me :/ 
Shit is just depressing. 
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:30:16
Dude...I was waiting for him.
@_date: 2019-02-24 17:06:02
Wow. All of that hype and good news gone. Yeah not ETF will ever be approved.   
This will be another year-long bear market. Any good news will be manipulated to take money from folks. It was nice finally seeing this place come alive again... but....yeah. Shorters will always win 
@_date: 2019-04-03 23:21:32
Pump and dump.
Don't sell you will regret it. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:42:54
This is horrible but what can you do. Crypto is a plaything for the rich. Whatever economic freedom people including myself were dreaming of is pretty much in the hands of the rich and petty lol. I hate to see so many people losing their money due to old people who have no idea how to settle their disputes behind closed doors.  Every coin is getting wrecked.  It is hard to keep faith in something that is easily toyed with. ETF will not get approved and Craig has shown he is pretty much untouchable. Any mining now is for sure doing it at a loss.   
All of this drama just scares people away from the mass adaption we wanted. A lot of merchants are going to see this high school drama and refuse to get near. Banks are loving this I am sure. I have not seen the so-called suicide threads but I do not blame people for becoming suicidal and it is a dick move to have any empathy for them. Time to step away from the market for a while and go back to other plans. Crypto, in general, will not recover from this till the rich kids are done with all the fighting.  I understand telling people not to sell but folks have to make ends meet and if this is draining you get out for a while. If you buy or hold at this point I personally do not think it even matters, in the long run, you will lose out. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 07:09:48
So much for Black Friday gains lol.   
@_date: 2018-03-31 21:18:58
I'm holding. Selling at this point is desperate. I understand guessing it's a matter of faith. Just seems like the community is robbing each other.
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:01:10
What comes next? 
@_date: 2018-11-27 22:30:37
I feel sorry for you.   
Making an account just to TRY to upset other people.   
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:54:35
So did the other half of the world wake up and decide to sell as well? Shit is falling like a brick 
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:50:58
So you agree with me?
@_date: 2019-04-01 17:24:22
Welp. I fell for a fake ETF approval joke today just by typing in Bitcoin on Google. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:47:46
3 k boys. Time to sell my gpus and Asics
@_date: 2018-11-16 08:21:55
BCH is trash and needs to go away. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 11:56:36
No end in sight. 
Might be another year of this 
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:47:18
So does the other side of the world wake up and decide to sell low? I understand miners need to cover their bills and people need to get the money back but...is there something I am missing here? I do not believe we will just go back to 20k in the blink of an eye but what is causing this?
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:02:31
This is frustrating. I want to go back to to 11K . 
What needs to happen? I understand we can't have a bull run everyday but the daily FUD shouldn't be this big of a deal same for any news from China. It's early 2018 I think it is too soon to call Bitcoin or cryptocurrency dead just yet. I understand the fad has passed which is fine. I'd rather the people who want this to work out be here anyway. Hope that April brings welcome change. This is not a get rich quick scheme but I do see it as a chance for folks to escape poverty and improve their QOL and that is something I want to support :/
@_date: 2018-03-16 02:11:08
Bitcoin was doing pretty damn great before that sell off. Even the amount of FUD articles changed to positive pieces. My question is what do we do from here? I am reading article that is saying miners should stop mining, people should stop buying, scam this and that and honestly I thought about getting out but just because of the SHEER amount of bs I want this community to come out on top. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:57:35
Cannot tell if today was good or bad day for Bitcoin. Is there even a point in selling THIS low? Why not buy and hold? This a long run game. Am I missing something? I am still noob after all. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:19:31
We went from 6k and flew up to 11k right? I know just because it happened once does not mean it will happen again but the gloom and doom in here seems almost intentional. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:13:01
For the first time I am making disposable income with Bitcoin. This has been great for me but at the same time I cannot help but feel powerless. Bitcoin gets attacked everyday online and I mean everyday. The huge sell off did not help at all. Just curious what makes you think it will bounce back up again? I want to not sell what I own at the moment and get out of Bitcoin but what could change to make all things more stable?
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:45:12
why August 11? 
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:44:01
This is just one ETF though. I thought it was looking good for one of them passing. Those damn twins already screwed up last year trying to get one passed right? Long as they stay the hell out it will not be messed up right? 
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:49:06
This is hard to watch. I would like to be wrong as well but this is exactly what bears wanted to happen as well. I see the trolls are back here as well. Was not too much of a dip but I pray things go well for you all. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:46:23
What would have to go right?
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:51:48
Those were the days.  
@_date: 2018-04-06 01:32:24
What is so special about the 15th? 
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:15:47
Yikes. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:14:00
Why do bears even carry on with their behavior? It hurts everyone I don't get it . 
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:29:27
I thought Bitcoin was dying. Was told that I was wrong and that I would be right back here. I am back but I could have sworn Bitcoin was heading to 9000. Are you telling me one ETF being rejected caused this much of a drop? I thought there were 5 ETFs being reviewed. Why are people freaking out over one? 
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:20:31
I mean it worked in finding nemo lol 
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:01:51
We can't expect new money till we at least get back to 10 K I would imagine. Unless we raise the money on our own to attract new adapters I certainly don't expect change.
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:08:59
It's silly but I do often feel like a group of us should save up and then buy at the same time. Make it s group effort. Not a kickstarter but gathering money to go in on one particular date. Make it a movement.
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:46:02
A recovery will happen. I hate to admit but human greed and true believers won't let this die. 
Bearish but only because im angry snd disappointed by that fork. The folks who come here everyday to troll are going to be here for awhile waiting for this to drop to 0 when it never will. May not get the prices we want but this wont hit 0. Big money haven't left the space...just biding their time
@_date: 2018-12-12 19:31:09
I agree. Kill the daily discussion thread. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:29:43
Rejected sadly 
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:36:02
You are pouring  water in a can with a huge hole in it.  
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:52:03
I hope I am wrong. I had big plans to mine damn near full time and buy my own space to do so. Right now my electricity  bill is not too bad but at this rate it aint pretty. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:18:49
1k by end of month 
Undee 1k by end of January
@_date: 2018-12-05 20:27:59
What about miners?
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:46:40
Lol here come the trolls. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:16:10
lol k 
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:24:27
Bullish as fuck. I might actually have to eat crow soon if this keeps up
@_date: 2018-12-12 11:04:32
From Detroit as well. 
This hit home. I'm super bearish on Crypto in general now only because of the fork messing things up. Will admit the trolls here are disgusting and it would be great to see my city prosper along with shutting some of these trolls up if we were ever to see a crypto recovery
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:53:45
Sell. 
Stop mining
Stop buying. 
Just let it die without wasting more money and time. Kill it. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:46:32
Ok tough guy. 
lol 
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:06:20
Geez so a delay on an etf choice causes more of a drop? The damn thing does not matter. I understand people wanting to sell there is no important good news. But selling because someone repeated news we already knew is crazy. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:50:30
You are such a child. I undersrand being disappointed but you are insulting everyone for attention. It is you not them. It's not  tyranny if it were you would have been blocked with no explanation a while ago and even then you would have earned it. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:10:47
Putting money into this is like pouring water into a can with a giant hole in it. Waste of money. The rest of my faith was killed when Wright and the other man babies tanked a whole market for their egos.  I'm out for good this time. Only here to watch and ocasionally spit bile like my fellow chumps. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 01:45:47
Mind accepting my pm?
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:49:37
It will not last forever. Bitcoin will hit 0 soon unless something changes. I'm not happy with what is going on but that fork killed everything and killed the reputation of the space. I am the last person hyped about this but it is time to face the truth. We cannot run the space we do not have enough money to maintain our own ecosystem. Not every one is willing to mine at a loss,buy knowing they will lose their coin shortly and there is no more fomo from regular folks. Bitcoin is a laughing stock at the family dinner table and so are the people who put anything into it. 
These trends will not last forever because the market is dying and will be dead in a few months. We are watching it's final moments unless we get some miracle.  
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:12:11
You really believe that? We should talk then. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:53:56
Please check your behavior. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:47:09
I def do not feel like this is the floor but we will know soon. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:12:03
I'm curious then unless the rest of the world finally decided crypto is trash. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 02:36:06
We were at 3.2k. and ended up touching 4k again.  
Market still seems bullish. But things are looking up and im very bearish. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:31:38
I'm totally bearish now after a year or two being bullish. Starting to hate crypto in general along with the zealots and manipulators but. I will admit there are only no coiners here now who came out to troll to feel justified in not missing out. Do not think you deserve the bs given and if bitcoin recovers from this anytime soon those same trolls will go back under their bridge. If that happens feel free to gloat. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 02:58:49
Fuck futures,fuck Craig Wright and fuck the pump and dumps. Bakkt and and ETF that will end up helping the rich further exploit the market might be the onky things can change things. We will see 2k. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 00:59:51
Seriously. Why should I or anyone buy right now?   I understand being happy but what makes anyone think that this is not going to be another pump and dumb?  The peer pressure to buy in here is crazy but with no good reasoning behind it. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 19:35:54
Sticking to the banks while getting screwed is not up anyone's alley. I am not crazy about banks but trying to claim that we are in a time where banks do not have ALL the power now is crazy. It still has all the power and with everything going on they do not feel threatened anymore. I get your point but as it is now Bitcoin is a burden.
