What do you think is the value of 1 BTC in the far future? Is it the value of a car, the value of a house or the value of a city? The value something has for you should be determined by its usability and availiability, not by what people pay for it. And if the current price is higher than what you value it, it's better to sell; if the price is lower than what you value it for, it's better to buy.
Nothing can grow infinitely. The price swings. Therefore there must be people who will one day buy at an ATH that will never be reached again.
For me, the value of a bitcoin is lower than its current price, this is why I don't own any anymore. But I personally don't think that it has the foundation to justify the current price. Even though I see the price climb every day, I have no ill feelings, as I've taken my profit and am pretty sure that the price will correct in the near future to better reflect its current value. That's when I might buy in again.

I'm active in both subreddits, what's the deal? Trying to see opposing sides of an argument usually helps to form a rounded opinion.

You can check on the omni explorer if new tethers were issued recently.

No, I'm fine with speculation. But I have the feeling that most people can't differentiate between investing and speculating. Sure, every investments price is determined in part by the speculation on its future value, but there should always be a fair balance between the speculative value and the already existing real world value. For me this balance is tipped to the speculation side too much. If L2 solutions and adoption catch up, the real world value increases and its current price is justified. But currently I'm not convinced yet that this will happen, so I'll wait and see how it turns out.

If the private key is in the QR-Code, who confirms that there is no photo taken from it before launch? How do you want to make sure it *really* can't be found on the computer that generated the keys?

It's not that I am afraid of big numbers, I just don't see the current price justified. Bitcoin has more than twice the market cap of e.g. Paypal, but I've only been able to realy use bitcoin for 3-4 purchases yet, and I'm sure that most Bitcoin hodlers didn't even do a single real world transaction with it. It currently lacks utility and adoption. Paypal on the other hand can be used on nearly every purchase online. Until scaling and adoption are improved by a big margin, I don't see Bitcoin holding this price very long.

You can loan out bitcoin on exchanges like poloniex to margin traders.

"you can't lose long therm if you HOLD" is a blatant lie that is either fueled by ignorance or bad intent. The price can go crashing down and not recover. It's a possible scenario you have to plan for.
"Anyone who bought and held made a profit" is only true when you are at an ATH.

That's not right - segwit was a soft fork and thereby did not affect concensus rules. An old node that runs in the BTC-network will still see everything as valid (even though it's useless if it didn't implement segwit). BCH increased the blocksize limit, which required a hard fork, so an old node would see the blocks of the BCH-network as invalid. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:11:05
Yes, going with a clean segwit + 2 MB blocksize hardfork would have been the best way to go IMO.

"Borrowed their code" - it's a fucking open source project. Everybody's free to fork off the code and create their own version if they like. That's the whole point of open source.

Without any data of your transaction, we cant tell you anything. Right click on your transaction and view it in any blockexplorer. It will then tell you if it already was included in a block.
@_date: 2017-02-06 12:22:40
Could you elaborate on Moneros scaling problem? Since there is no hard-coded blocksize cap, I see that the blockchain may grow significantly faster, but I don't think this justifies a statement that 'Monero doesn' t scale at all'. Please let me know what I am missing.

How ia ripple a scamcoin? AFAIK its a coin that has an entirely different goals and requires trust between the parties - but for me that does not qualify for a scamcoin. Its useful if you want to convert currencies for example.

Yes, there are several Wallets you can use on your PC, [Electrum]( for example. If you are using a software wallet be sure to make a backup (aka save your wallet generating seed) somewhere safe, as the wallet can be restored with it in case something goes wrong.

You can ask and maybe get lucky.

Remember when 2X supporters were talking about a "silent majority"? Seems like it was right. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 12:38:43
So this is only an issue when blocks have a lot of free space. Also the miner would have to deal with the risk that his block could be abandoned, especially since the miner of the first block has an incentive to continue the chain from his block. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 10:59:39
Could you explain how re-mining a block would me more viable then adding a new block? The only situation I can think of would be that there are no pending transactions to put in your block, otherwise you could simply put in new transactions and get the same fee reward for it.

2X and with it the only chance to get a usable currency in a timely manner died. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 18:07:45
Sorry, in my mind I was thinking about software wallets. For HW wallets you only need to access the key file when you initially create it and when you want to restore it. If you're paranoid about keyloggers create it on a fresh install of windows/linux.

Putting your keys down analog seems like such a stupid concept to me. We are living in 2019, dealing with cryptocurrencies and rely on safes/hiding places to keep our money safe?
Here's how to do it the crypto-way:
1. Get an open-source password-manager like keepass
2. Save your seeds as passwords.
3. Save the keyfile on multiple devices and with a cloud provider.
If you chose a secure master-password, your keys will be safe. If your house burns down, you'll have them in the cloud. If your cloud provider shuts down his service, you can still migrate to another service.
The one thing crypto should have tought you is to not rely on obfuscation to keep your secrets safe, but sound mathematics. Even if someone gets your keyfile, they cannot do anything with it. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 16:35:09
Well, a keylogger would steal your funds the moment you entered your seed to access your wallet.

This is not an explaination of how 33% hashpower should be enough, it's an unbacked statement. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:42:48
Thanks for an actual, detailed explaination. Just for other ones following the thread, he is referring to this paper: 
I see how this is indeed a problem. However, I don't think that sybil attacks would be quite as effective as it's in the best interest of every mining pool to be directly connected with any other mining pool to get blocks quickly. Mining like this would also be obvious to others as the mining pool would often transmit multiple blocks together. It would be in their best interest to not mine on the attackers block in the case of a chain split as they would give miners incentive to join the attacker by increasing his profitability. Therefore, I think that pools would try to mine on the chain that does not belong to the attacker, decreasing the value of Z (and thereby the profitability of the attacker).
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:25:23
This requires you to control all nodes that are connected to the miners you want to block. Most likely, major mining nodes will be directly connected anyways since they get a better letency for propagated blocks (you get them directly instead of waiting for a few hops) which makes this a highly unlikely or even impossible scenario. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:12:07
You could give him !redditsilver
@_date: 2019-01-27 07:41:56
Nah, I just tried to phrase it in a somewhat interesting way :)
Hiding places can be found. Places can burn down. A good password cannot be broken. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:14:14
The thing is that you are talking about an unrealistic scenario here. You would need to block all communication channels between the other parties which is not feasible. It's not like someone just lets you control all their incoming traffic. You would need to stop any node from propagating any blocks that are not yours. This is impossible unless oyu control all nodes connected to the other miners. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:55:09
And how exactly do you want to achieve said block of communication? Does not seem like a realistic scenario to me. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:25:18
Explain this statement please. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:26:50
There are ways that would take minimal extra space and provide the ability to not forget old coins. If you just save the Block hash of the overwritten contents (but not the content), you can make a rule that ib order to spend a coin that was not moved in 100 years (or however long you want the time to start overwriting be), you need to provide the block yourself, and it only gets compared to the list of old block hashes. There could easily be a third party service storing them, but in order to have a node you would not need the old blocks. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 02:30:50
Theres another thing I've been asking myself: is the UASF even a softfork? If it was, it should be completely compatible. Since the nodes are blocking non-segwit transaction, these won't be usable, even though they were usable before. So why is the UASF not organized as a proper hard fork? 
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:15:20
Paying while the price is high is the best you can do. You are effectively selling without fees and support the ecosystem. Keep it up :) 
@_date: 2017-05-21 08:49:20
Thank you for this wonderful, detailed explaination, it really cleared things up for me :) 
I have one more question though: will the UASF also trigger a difficulty adjustment? If not, the UASF-chain will have slow block times, if it is additionally attacked by the miners it may be almost unusable. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 02:16:11
I remember replay protection being a thing that was widely discussed when BU first gained traction. It was consensus that they shouldn't fork until they had a working concept to prevent replay attacks. Since it is the UASF-supporters that will split off, its now their job to offer a sound concept to prevent spendings on the wrong chain. 
How will this be achieved?
