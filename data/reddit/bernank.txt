Lamassu is cool if you are familiar with sysadmining and don't mind tracking your transactional data directly on the blockchain.

Seemed pretty new, hard to know though. I'll try to find the contact info and forward the owner along these suggestions, thanks.

It says Macbook, but that doesn't mean he's running Mac OS. Try not being so smug.

Bitcoin isn't magic or a panacea, and the position I have in it is most likely laughable compared to many here, but at least it is an option for people in what is otherwise a negative interest rate economy that punishes savers and the middle class and wreaks havoc on retirement plans. A system outside the system which has never existed before.
Now, maybe some of that QE money will spill over into funding low-cost solar-powered smart phones so people can skip the computer issue altogether... that's an air drop I'd get behind.

Was it as sketchy as the talking heads are making it out to be?

Any word on what kind of operating system he was using?

Only 0.25 away from 999.99 which would be quite lucky indeed!

Can anyone vouch for this website?

If you think there is any "safe" investment in this farce we find ourselves in, you are deluding yourself. You can't even trade glimmer....

Ohh yes, and when the FDIC's **billion** dollars in available insurance blows up trying to cover **trillions** in deposits, who are we to call? Oh, Janet Yellen? And what will she do? Add a few zeros to the Fedwire database? Ahh I see.
A shame that a degree in economics these days equates to a school of thought that basically implies, somehow if we just print enough money, more natural resources and economic opportunities will magically appear.
Oh and if that doesn't work, destroy the free market for interest rates, because nothing jump starts the economy like massive capital misallocation chasing returns in a zero-yield economy.
@_date: 2014-10-30 05:50:45
You are assuming wages aren't sticky, and that we have a healthy economy consummate with the amount of debt spent on the pursuit of economic opportunities. Tell anyone with $20,000 in student loan debt and fixed wages that somehow inflation is going to help them out....

This guy sounds like a douchebag.

Interesting quote, seems conflicting? "Though the shell of the machine will be the same as those issued by Genesis Coin, Brunner said that Trucoin's units will offer fans the ability to buy bitcoin with their debit cards at the big game."

No, interesting... word I'm hearing is that their core development team was shifted to deciding the hex code for the color of the new white Xbox One.

X-post but relevant, I've used a Skyhook 6 times now. My experience has been:
-33% of the time the machine freezes once the QR code is scanned.
-16.5% of the time the bill acceptor failed to turn on and no bills would be accepted
-16.5% of the time the internet was dead and the machine was displaying a white page with a weird PHP error about failed connection
-33% of the time I was able to successfully buy a little bit of Bitcoin
It's pretty good for the money, I suppose, but I don't see how it'd be practical for anyone to own and operate 24 of these.
Edit: looks like I wasn't alone with the bill issue -- 
@_date: 2014-11-05 07:56:14
Sounds like an exciting career! I think you're smart to take risks at your age, you can always recover. Bitcoin seems to be a really asymmetric investment play, my thinking is that it will either be huge or vapor.

This seems like a cool idea for an opt-in feature, I like it.

Continue to believe that inflating the money supply will produce more natural resources or a more optimal economy, just as you so smugly make assumptions about my academic and financial standings.

Do you know how to program? If not, this just sounds like yet another rant of everybody's favorite "ideas person" compensating for a lack of programming knowledge by belittling all programmers as unfit for contemplating product development or direction.

Maybe this process is flawed? Why not keep a few coins on hand for smaller transactions, that way you aren't overly reliant on the exchange-based liquidity?
@_date: 2013-11-09 11:19:33
I admire you Snowda, you aren't an idiot I sense a genuinely inquisitive mind and for that I applaud you. I hope you find your answers and hone your prediction skills.

Where are you getting the "cash cost" of gold as being $150? I looked through your foot notes and none of them, including your referenced  point to it being $150.  says 


You and  both quote it at $150 but either you have a definition of "cash cost" than I do, or you are about $600 off.

Yeah.. this must be a joke. Unless you generated 100+ new bitcoin addresses and interacted with them without backing up, your original wallet.dat file should be fine.
@_date: 2013-07-14 01:06:38
to those being critical -- c'mon, easy to add ellipsis and face-palms from this side of the table, but let's be real ... can you imagine the arduous task of operating this kind of business Stateside? We can only imagine what the operational side of this biz looks like and I am sure it's a lot more complicated, convoluted, and hard to manage than meets the eye. anyways, coinbase ftw
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:14:57
maybe, maybe not.

this is great advice to anyone who is always wrong when trading ... just remember, anytime you think you are doing it right, do the opposite!

Nice effort but I can't read the text
@_date: 2013-02-05 00:42:49
the javascript at the bottom of the page seems to be doing it.

I'd like to point out to those of you who think we are due for another April style crash that probably the largest reason for the crash was due to the exchange system being extremely fragile and centralized in Empty-Gox's hands.
If you weren't around or don't remember:
1. MtGox came under heavy DDoS, trading engine lag meant that the market was basically broken
2. MtGox proceeded to shut down ALL TRADING for 12+ hours
3. MtGox was THE LIQUIDITY PROVIDER at that time, all others were a blip still
Things are much different now
