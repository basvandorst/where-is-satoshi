Continuing development is 'marketing to fool the masses' ?   Duuude.
@_date: 2019-07-08 10:09:29
Excellent gaslighting bud.
@_date: 2019-07-28 03:22:13
Arresting the shit out of paedophiles?  
What the fuck are you smoking ?
@_date: 2019-07-01 14:45:50
Actually :
There were some issues found with one of the implementations of bch and those were promptly fixed.  Other than that it just worked.
No lost tx's no massive fees and no overt centralization.
Keep in mind btc is centralized at the dev layer.  There is only one implementation,  so to argue bch is somehow more impacted doesn't really fly.
@_date: 2019-07-27 14:36:59
No kidding eh?
@_date: 2019-07-20 18:28:22
Oh come on now.  You surely know the market is constantly manipulated in much the same fashion.
@_date: 2019-07-28 02:15:30
it can be captured through economic regulation or by effective ownership of the codebase.   
Arguably, it's already happened.
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:50:10
Exactly.  This sub has been that way for years now.
@_date: 2019-07-20 21:48:41
I'm sorry,  did you not notice who the president of the US happens to be ? The cattle have been bought and sold quite through their own free will.  No, they're not very brilliant.
@_date: 2019-07-01 14:36:27
Ln hasn't solved their routing problem.
@_date: 2019-07-07 16:46:02
Bch already has it so it's not horribly clear why btc is dragging feet.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:33:05
Right.  That was the single implementation that had a bug.  
Regardless,  btc has a massive bug right now that is preventing adoption. It's a bug that will require both on and off chain scaling to resolve.
Right now LN isn't capable of doing the job.  Factually,  LN has more issues than either btc or bch, both in UI and operationally.  Tthose issues can be resolved but there are no guarantees.  
In the meantime people try btc, find it's expensive and slow, and leave the crypto spce completely.  This has to stop.
@_date: 2019-07-07 23:39:29
Sounds sufficient to add the feature and continue development as required.
@_date: 2019-07-28 04:15:48
I get it.  Hillary personally demanded cheese pizza delivered delivered free of charge 
Wtf is wrong with you?
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:30:58
BTC has no boss ?  really ? are you sure ?
@_date: 2019-07-20 18:06:53
The market is subject to massive manipulation.    Won't fix crap.
@_date: 2019-07-24 11:08:07
You realize that funding LN channels will not be 'very big' transactions right?
The fee hit alone will be painfull.
@_date: 2019-07-27 17:23:04
Honestly though,  tether is shady as hell.
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:52:23
That's not what you're doing though is it ?
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:46:54
Are you sure you know what manipulation means?
People are easily fooled by their most favourite media campaign.   Controlling the masses through media is much cheaper than controlling a government department i might add.
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:44:37
@_date: 2019-07-07 23:42:22
Exactly.  Not very sound financial policy to plan on freezing out those accounts.
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:33:34
Hey,  look at that !  A useless reply from a real shill .
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:44:57
Yes, user error.   LN does add further user error to the mix.   agreed. Although,  I see you are going to avoid the AMP routing part completely ?  Ok.  
The BCH reorg was a 51% as much as BTC's reorgs were.  You might notice there were no malicious results in either the btc or bch cases.
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:49:33
I think if you'll read a bit closer you might notice you're the one moving the goalposts.
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:59:49
The best you've done so far is blindly call schoolyard names and reply with zero real content.
You are FUD'ing,  not I.
@_date: 2019-07-01 14:48:55
Also -  just checked again to be sure but contrary to your comment LN is still beta release.
One should *not* trust money to an unfinished product or service.
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:45:41
Really ?  You won't go the distance and explain to a newb exactly what is going on with their money ?  really ?
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:21:56
Interesting - what features are missing then ?
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:22:17
Are you calling the mods snowflakes ?
@_date: 2019-07-07 20:24:44
I see.   so even though everyone else is capable of testing carefully and implementing features quicker, this is fine. 
You also imply Schnorr sigs have no consensus yet. lol.
@_date: 2019-07-20 18:14:36
Can you truly have a democratic decision if there is only one option?
@_date: 2019-07-01 14:16:51
For christ sake.  Just raise the goddamned blocksize to 8 megabytes already.
Yes, it's a temporary solution.  No, it won't hurt security.  It damned well will help adoption while LN flounders around to an eventual 'real' release.
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:34:18
Works for you therefore it works for the entire market ?  nope.nope.nope.  
One of the biggest problems crypto has today is onboarding.   It's hard enough already trying to find a newb-friendly way to buy crypto.  Now try to explain why someone needs to spend coin to lock up their coin in a secondary framework just to use their coin.   You'll be told point blank to just use visa.   They won't be wrong either.   Visa blows LN and BTC out of the water at the moment and that's not going to change anytime soon.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:37:14
I'm sorry, what ?
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:50:58
with or without watchtowers ?   LN also has a vastly higher chance of failing any transaction above the average amount.
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:30:01
You're mistaking past performance for a prediction of the future.   There are many things that could derail any crypto.   BTC happens to suffer from a couple large blindspots that could tank it and a good chunk of the market for years. 
Also - don't expect LN to solve anything.   By attempting to scale off-chain - and with only one off-chain option - BTC is ripe for capture.  Arguably, it's already captured. 
Anyway, nothing is guaranteed.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:00:10
Got one.  They work well.  Nice interface.
@_date: 2019-07-01 14:18:42
LN needs propper routing first.
@_date: 2019-07-07 23:38:34
I suspect the same.  Very snowflake like indeed !
@_date: 2019-07-26 14:28:11
Dem LN hubs tho.
@_date: 2019-07-14 14:56:37
Certainly a crypto will end up being the international standard but it's still not clear which one or when.
Don't count your chickens quite yet.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:42:37
No,  not very complicated.  Just be sure to keep a copy of your recovery seed in a secure place.  
The only cost is the mining fee.  
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:24:35
Correct!  It's not the routing issue, but it does show there are \*many\* problems with LN currently.  I particularly love the last paragraph where the author's solution to these problems is to ignore critics and blindly soldier on.  That's cool,  can't see any downsides to that tactic.   
So - you have total faith in AMP then ? Problem solved? pray tell how is AMP not just a band-aid ?
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:20:56
I expect nothing less.  ��
@_date: 2018-09-19 02:42:36
We need to get rid of third parties but we desperately need lightning?
Seems to me those hubs are going to end up being the visa-style third party eventually.
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:44:22
Go right ahead.  Just make your source available.
@_date: 2019-11-22 03:21:48
Wtf.  Of course btc could go to zero.  All it takes is a better version to come along.
@_date: 2019-11-22 15:26:22
Why bother though ?  Just use btc straight.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:47:40
Hey,  would you look at that?  An excellent example of projection.
@_date: 2019-11-22 17:27:02
All cryptos can fail.  Of course they can.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:51:16
I think you are misunderstanding the concept of 'better'.
@_date: 2019-11-22 03:14:43
That and transaction fees...
@_date: 2019-11-24 15:57:59
False dichotomy bud.  I don't have to use btc as money at all.  Other cryptos are blowing right by btc in terms of adoption.
No bother required.
@_date: 2019-11-22 02:45:55
He has a point.  The fear that kind pf drop would foster in the btc community would probably keep the downward momentum.
Combine that with the fact btc is essentially useless and there could be bad times ahead.
@_date: 2019-11-24 17:17:13
Options are good for everyone.  That way nobody needs be tied to a dead horse.
@_date: 2019-11-23 03:00:56
I'm not sure you got your point figured out.
BTC sucks as money.  It's real world value fluctuates massively and any attempt to transfer it under nominal currency loads results in a massive transfer tax - mining fees skyrocket due to congestion.
And no - LN is not bitcoin.  It won't save BTC from the nearsightedness of the core devs.  Insisting it will only underscores how badly btc works as cash.
So what utility does it have exactly?
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:46:25
There would certainly be turmoil in the crypto markets if it happens quickly.  
On the other hand,  if people just start using another crypto due to BTC's high fees and general stagnation then the market will simply transition with only minimal turbulence.
It's plain and simple ignorance to think BTC will be forever king.
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:54:56
Litecoin also has zero development.
@_date: 2019-11-22 02:38:16
Bch is popular with some merchants.  Try that.
@_date: 2019-11-24 06:54:59
F'ing lol.  Just ?
@_date: 2018-10-27 00:35:36
Bitcoin has Ln hubs as middlemen.   Visa will be one of those hubs for sure. 
@_date: 2019-11-23 15:06:34
Exactly the reason you reply with no points or actual thought i imagine.
Seriously.  Think about this a bit.  People are expecting you to blindly tow the btc political line without knowing why.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:59:41
Even though the devs say not to trust it with significant amounts of money.
Yeah.  That's a great idea.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:55:39
Cool.  So you know what btc has in terms of utility.
Please share with the rest of the class your immutable wisdom.
@_date: 2018-10-28 01:33:16
They're going to co-opt LN and effectively insert themselves in a huge number of transactions.
This would be bad juju because the majority here would crow at the apparent success of LN and btc while flinging money at visa.
Feelsbadman.  It's coming.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:58:37
Lighting is not bitcoin.  It's a complicated and currently dangerous solution to a manufactured problem.
@_date: 2019-11-22 03:20:05
Winner winner chicken dinner.
The whole lack of utility thing might be coming home to roost.
@_date: 2018-10-27 04:33:58
Yes,  you will have to use LN.   That's the point of having LN.
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:02:25
My appologies for the behaviour of our fellow redditors.  They would rather not answer your question.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:53:45
Some coins will die out.  Certainly.
Btc might be one of those coins.  Why not?
@_date: 2018-06-02 19:22:24
Sure you can do something about the government.   Absolutely you can.  That's arguably the first point of crypto.  But to do so you need more than one option.   Refusing any on-chain scaling kills one of those options. 
As for where the majority of transactions will take place; that remains to be seen.  Might not be on the BTC blockchain.  Might not be with BTC at all.
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:54:39
This is dumb.  Of course you care about losing money.  
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:00:35
You need scaling to avoid governments and corporations capturing the 2nd layer and  ruining the point of crypto.
@_date: 2019-08-24 13:49:29
Adoption is way more important than price and that has been dropping pretty quickly as well.    I don't believe his conclusions but we are probably not going to see another ATH until adoption reverses course and starts climbing.
@_date: 2018-06-03 02:17:57
Litecoin ?  Duuude. Lol.
@_date: 2019-08-10 09:42:02
You're right about vendors not accepting btc.  It's just not usable anymore.
@_date: 2018-06-03 13:09:00
The current set of devs won't touch on-chain even as a last resort.  The point isn't to render BTC usable, it's to force people to off-chain solutions.
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:13:16
I thought BTC didn't scale?  That's why LN was cooked up.
@_date: 2019-08-10 12:53:11
Lol.  Calling bullshit on that.  Trading with your basement dwelling neckbeard friends isn't "using it".
@_date: 2018-06-03 02:15:55
2nd layer for sure.  In combination with on chain scaling of course.  
That's the way you get to a world wide currency.  
@_date: 2019-10-20 00:54:38
Sooooo. 18 months ?
@_date: 2019-10-06 13:38:02
That is a dangerously risky presumption.  The current market shows no intent to go up before christmas.
More than that,   if the market stays flat there is a big chance of a selloff in the new year.

@_date: 2019-06-03 13:01:51

@_date: 2019-06-01 05:17:44

Dude.  Learn to read.
@_date: 2019-06-01 21:46:11

This last comment of yours is a blatant example.  You're just purposefully misunderstanding the entire point.  grow a pair and learn how to read and understand things.   you'll enjoy life more.   
..or just go outside for a bit. you might need some air.
@_date: 2019-06-29 12:01:38
Can't moon if you can't use it.
Adoption needs to happen.
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:04:26
could be positive.   could be a tether pump.  could be a financial institution buying in.  there's certainly no real adoption going on.
@_date: 2019-06-30 01:11:48
For anyone really.  The only people I hear having bandwidth problems are americans and nomads in the South Sahara.  In either case the rest of the world is quite capable.
@_date: 2019-06-01 21:47:12
Do you vist r/bitcoin often ?  Borders on the very definition of religion.
@_date: 2019-06-30 01:04:59
That's how it's supposed to work.  In reality BTC is captured by a single dev team, more or less funded by a company who's supposed line of products requires full blocks to be effective.
ie: if the dev team raised the block size everyone would follow but blockstream wouldn't have a reason to exist.
@_date: 2019-06-30 01:08:15
that shows me that 10mb blocks are no problem right now though....
@_date: 2019-06-19 14:31:39
That's nothing compared to what visa/FB are intending.
They will win through adoption unless we stop dicking around.
@_date: 2019-08-24 13:46:52
He's right about the largest crypto advocates.  They've totally overthrown the original intent of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-26 23:53:16
Both points are true.  
Prople are being misled about the purpose of bitcoin AND they have the right to trust institutions as they see fit.
@_date: 2019-06-19 12:01:16
People will buy the FB coin because zuck and visa will make sure people can acutally use it.
Unlike btc which is strangled by fees.
@_date: 2019-06-29 13:27:40
Btc is drowning in high fees and slow transaction times and we really ought to slap a symbol on keyboards for adoption...?
@_date: 2019-06-01 05:16:28
You all seem to be illiterate.  What's up with that?  
Globbing wallet addresses and IPs is actually trivial when opening a channel.

Congrats !  
Now go hedge your bets by gathering the top four coins.
@_date: 2019-12-01 16:37:45
Considering LN is not necessarily limited to btc it would be incorrect to assume btc.
@_date: 2019-12-01 21:23:09
Dipping since 2017...  I know it will go up again.  Just not sure when or which bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-05 23:24:23
Yeah... probably not tether.   Always a good idea to spread your bets as much as possible.
@_date: 2019-06-02 14:28:05
Who the hell mentioned bcash?     
Speaking of bullshit - you run nodes and don't have a clue how this might be done ? come on now.  You're just being dense.
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:29:43
This is an unforgivably retarded point of view.   There is zero guarantee BTC will be a valid coin in 5 to 10 years.     
Like every other investment, diversify wisely.
@_date: 2019-12-02 13:19:05
Duh.  The point is to be clear to the customer.
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:19:59
Everyone should be moving to an incomplete and aguably broken solution?
@_date: 2019-12-01 17:27:48
Ok -  I'd like 200L of oxygen pls.
@_date: 2019-12-01 14:13:11
Naw...  That's a core supporter touting btc as a replacement for fiat.
@_date: 2018-03-13 23:41:21
First thing that comes to mind is 'juvenile attempt at propaganda' to be honest.
@_date: 2019-01-01 04:01:15
Actually,  what I see is a smallish number of large hubs that provide the overwhelming liquidity for LN.    
Those hubs disappear and that liquidity goes with them.  The whole thing collapses.    This smells of banking, it really does. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 21:31:53
I have read the article.  It says nothing about centralized architectural changes.
@_date: 2019-01-16 04:57:32
That's some good work right there.  Thanks for the github link !
@_date: 2019-01-08 01:11:52
Not huge.  Pretty blah actually.
@_date: 2019-01-01 04:27:37
Yeah, no.  This does not look good.  Especially with no proper routing.
@_date: 2019-01-01 06:05:09
I have a bunch of concerns but they roughly all boil down to these points : 
* I need to be online 24/7 or trust someone else with my cash.
* I need to dedicate cash to individual channels to transact - bank account ? 
* I need to hope there is a route that can support my transaction amount - harder as the amount goes up.
* Funds appear to be locked if the channel becomes unresponsive ? not sure about that. 
* The basic design of LN and the lack of routing indicates nearly complete centralization within a short-ish timeframe as the only sure-fire routes will go through the biggest hubs - banks !
* and lastly, routing is broken and not going to get fixed anytime soon. 
Now don't get me wrong,  2nd layer stuff like LN is great but it absolutely must never be the only way to transact bitcoin.  we need a mix of on and off chain transactions - and they must both be cheaply used. 
If LN becomes useable and on-chain transactions become massively expensive in comparison then it becomes trivial to hobble the entire concept of crypto.  Banking becomes the norm once again through LN channels.   
Obviously this can absolutely not be allowed to happen.  we need on and off chain solutions to prevent capture. 
Well so anyway, my opinion of course.  I'd just really like to avoid repeating history. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 12:15:39
Tx per minute is a big one.  
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:26:50
My guess was 3-4k but 2k is very possible. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:01:09
Yeah. no.
@_date: 2019-09-17 11:27:34
You do realize that you can predict to reasonable certanty the impact 100% segwit adoption would have?
Cliff notes version - not that much.
@_date: 2019-09-05 22:43:41
Bitcoin did change imho.
@_date: 2019-09-16 14:31:28
Segwit isn't going to stop high fees.
@_date: 2019-05-29 15:33:42
LOL !  you're awfully easily triggered.  
Reality is there is no reason to assume this isn't being done.  You know that of course.
@_date: 2019-05-07 01:31:57
100K btc would not kill a thing.   In fact,  it would fuel a giant jump in prices across the board.
@_date: 2018-12-23 20:00:19
It looks like hubs.  Very centralized hubs. 
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:53:39
I don't think routing has been solved for LN so it sure as heck isn't applicable to this use case. 
But hey,  mining the information from the resulting LN hubs might be profitable for the new banks.
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:16:17
Go read again.  Yes it's possible.
@_date: 2019-05-03 10:46:01
People were telling me this just before quadrigacx dissapeared.  
Don't give them time to prove themselves crooked.  Move on before shtf.
