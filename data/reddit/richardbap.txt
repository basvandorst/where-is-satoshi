yes you are 100% safe to stick with it, god some people in here must be subscribers to with the way they exaggerate and talk hysterically
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:19:03
turn your fucking caps lock off
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:31:50
yes, this sounds awesome!
I've always thought about have the option for something like if price drops X% in X time frame buy X amount at market
Even just price alerts would be nice, either setting s price target or %change in a specified time
@_date: 2013-12-15 12:51:41
The moral of the story is (always) if you are not the only person in control of your coins private keys, then your coins are not safe

@_date: 2013-11-26 11:48:29

exactly, if banks wanted to, they would definitely make money off of bitcoin.
As somebody else said, an example;
Imagine if a large Bank decided to open they're own exchange, guarantee all bitcoins held, and had an online wallet too. this new exchange would ista-kill the current ones, even with higher fees or a cost to use

hahahah this is hilarious for multiple reasons.
1. People still use that useless site and believe it can accomplish anything
2. thinking 100,000 people will sign that petition
3. thinking the whitehouse will get involved with expediting SEC clearance of a private company
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:10:26
i have to agree with the Chinese push being more speculative than making their funds un-seizeable to their government
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:39:45
you most likely had in on the bitcoin desktop client, seach your pc for a wallet.dat file
If you have since reformatted your pc and you have an old backup of your c:/ id recommend installing this  (lightweight indexer) and search all your hdds for wallet.dat
good luck

you should make this table into a public google docs spreadsheet

as someone else mentioned, BIP0038 priv key on one side, pub key on the other would be pretty badass

if statements like this inspire confidence in bitcoin then fine, but bitcoin will absolutely continue to be used in black markets. that person obviously doesn't know of bitcoin tumblers/mixers
