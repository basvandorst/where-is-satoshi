I’d buy now but I think it’s a fake

That's because ideally you should be doing your own research via a simple google search. It's the best way to learn the in's and out's of bitcoin, cold storage, forks, etc.

It's deemed a "property", so any taxes will be not only on the capital gains but also your sales tax rate. I read somewhere that only 801 people reported bitcoin earnings to the IRS last year.

Basically imagine Bitcoin is like a bank that just holds a database of credits. To deposit funds in the bank, you find someone willing to sell you their credits in exchange for your fiat, and vice-versa. Now half the employees decide they don't like the way things are going, copy the *entire* database, and set up a bank across the street. You now have exactly the same credits in each bank, but it's an open question as to how much fiat you can get for the credits in each of your accounts. (The miners come into this as they're the ones that keep the lights on in the bank, but only get paid in credits that they must sell for their actual expenses. So there's always new credits on the market for sale, but if the price isn't high enough they'll quit or, more likely, defect.)

No. It's always best to own your private keys vs. Coinbase. Especially with a fork, you own your 2x coins vs. letting Coinbase dictate when they would give them to you. Same thing happened with Bitcoin Cash months back.

Yes. It's equal to your amount of Satoshi's

Because the new 2x coins are tied to the same private key that you had for your BTC. As long as you own your private key you will get the equivalent amount when the hard fork happens.  It's a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain. That is why people are recommending you hold onto the 2x coins for a bit before trading them due to "replay". 
Coinbase claims that you will automatically be credited with an equal balance of B2X which was different than with the Bitcoin Cash since Cash is essentially an alt coin however Coinbase is shady and the whole 2x push altogether is shady and full of democratic bullshit

Awesome! Would you mind sharing a link of one?
