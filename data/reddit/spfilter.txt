The one that has replay protection is the forked one... the other just continues to be mined like no forked has happened...It's very simple.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:03:20
Protects both ways, but only was implemented in the BCH blockchain.
Older (pre fork) nodes continue to work with BTC as usual...
It was the BCH blockchain that become invalid to the original blockchain.

This was my experience with BTC fees today:
They are high, too high for what they should, but they are not exorbitant high in my case (0.32% of the value transferred).
This was a SegWit transfer with the fastest and most expensive fee available in Ledger Nano S.

When you sell, the euros will be in your EUR Wallet. 
I think it shows how much € you will have after fees.
Then you have the 0.15€ fee to transfer from your wallet to your bank account.
Hint: You can login in  (the exchange of coinbase), with same user and password, deposit BTC from your coinbase BTC wallet (free and instantaneous) and then place a sell limit order (when price is above x) to sell with 0 fees.
Then you can withdraw EUR to your coinbase EUR wallet (also free and instantaneous).

With european SEPA transfer is 0.15€
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:55:38
Yes, sure.
He can send BTC/ETH/LTC to any wallet address for free using GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:00:18
Have a nice day!
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:46:59
It is 10100€ in GDAX...
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:45:02
There is another one of 138 BTC at 10000€.
For the pair BTC/EUR in gdax, it is a big wall... for BTC/USD in Bitfinex is not...
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:47:40
Use Blockfolio app and insert your Holdings.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:46:09
Hold the BCH for some more days, wait for the BTC next correction / dip and then use the the pair BCH/BTC to change them to BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:45:20
Because it is the sub for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:45:31
Direct buy + fees Vs market orders
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:37:56
Happy 11K Euro
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:14:08
In my country, 0.32% is still much lower than 3 or 4% for same day wire transfers...
But still very high for what it used to be with BTC...
@_date: 2018-05-21 18:16:56
The original Bitcoin whitepaper that started all says: 
So here is where you should go for the real Bitcoin (BTC).
BCH is Bitcoin Cash (one of many hard forks) like BTG (Bitcoin Gold) for example.
The only difference is that some of the Bitcoin Cash crowd wants to pass it like it is the original Bitcoin (using  etc.).
Bitcoin (BTC) is father of all coins and it is the one that started at a mere cents and is now worth more than 8000$ (but remember that you can by a small part of a BTC).
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:06:08
You mean 0 fees for limit orders....
Also 0 transaction fees to an external wallet....
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:35:57
Low profit, but check 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:50:25
Yes... But maybe you'll get some Bitcoin Diamond...
Please be aware of the dangers of trying to claim forked coins, if you insert your private keys online. You could lose your BTC.
Where are your BTC?
Hardware wallets like Ledger facilitate safe coin split.
Some exchanges might also allow you to withdraw forked coins.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:12:58
I transfer by wire to coinbase EUR wallet (no fees).
Then I deposit in GDAX from the coinbase wallet (no fees).
If I buy in GDAX with limit order, I pay no fees...
Only if I buy immediately with market order, I'll pay something like a fee of 0.5%.
So, I'm very happy with GDAX/Coinbase.
Also, the price is not defined by an external entity... The price is defined by the market in each exchange (order book and trades). Sometimes GDAX is higher, sometimes is lower.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:22:42
I think october 24th...
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:09:27
0 fees on limit orders....
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:03:48
Keep it...
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:45:03
Maybe, but there's a French flag in the sentence...
I no longer have the sense of value in Francs, Marks, Pesetas, Escudos, Liras, etc...
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:04:35
Sure, disregard dozens of thousands of new users creating accounts, just in coinbase, to buy BTC.
Let me guess, you have lots of "the real Bitcoin"?
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:07:42
You can first transfer money to their EUR / USD? Wallet.
Then you buy instantly with that fiat in your coinbase wallet.
In Europe it takes 1 day to transfer to coinbase...
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:42:27
It's a market...if the order book is at that price.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:33:21
The less risky decision should be on the coin with most market cap, brand, exchanges, ie, Bitcoin (BTC) at currently $9500.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:29:16
Francs? Do you still use that?
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:29:53
SEPA transfer to Coinbase EUR Wallet, then using their exchange site GDAX to deposit from EUR wallet and placing limit order to buy.
All of that with no fees!
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:59:26
Buy BTC :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:32:31
The snapshot of BTC blockchain was October 24th.
The first BTG block mined in BTG blockchain was November 12th.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:33:23
Tell him to buy 2.44 BTC (at current rates)...
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:27:41
Depositing fiat, buying crypto, withdrawling, everything free without any fees on GDAX...
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:15:44
Yeah, spend $900000 just to start over....
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:14:32
Me too, I have use it to split Bitcoin Gold.
Here's how to:
If Bitcoin Diamond blockchain becomes real and functional, a split tool in ledger will be available for sure.
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:50:16
Ponzi? 
Do you even know what that means?
Do you receive money from the new buyers (without selling them your BTCs)?
And what do you mean by "not on the same level"??
$9000 is aproximately 7550€, so we are on the same level!
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:21:02
Sure, just convert BTC to USD or EUR in Coinbase/GDAX, for example, and transfer it to your bank account.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:30:47
Have you sent this information to Tether and LocalBitcoins?
(if they don't know already...)
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:24:29
8000€ is also close...
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:51:17
I would use coinbase or bitstamp, instead...
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:34:37
Congrats, how many BTC did those $3750 have you?
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:24:44
To own 100 BTC again, instead of recovering the lost ones...
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:42:17
I would go with a nice round number to BTC, for example 3 BTC, then the rest to Bitcoin Cash which is a fork from Bitcoin that seems to be holding nicely and maybe Etherum.
Or just go full BTC and enjoy the profit. 
I'm on 120% profit (more than doubled my investment) in BTC just in 2 months.
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:15:48
Never had a problem....
Always transfer to Coinbase, then on GDAX, go to Deposit and select the wallet from Coinbase, it is instantaneous.
