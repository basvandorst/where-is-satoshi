I'm not sure if my analogy is correct but is it like saying that our currency is backed by the press that prints it?

Yeah but the only reason why it has value is because people "trust" it for now. As soon as the trust is gone, the value will plumet. The difference between Bitcoin and currency, is that a currency is backed by gold, petrol or even a nation, I honestly don't know what backs Bitcoins.

Thanks for your answers man, I'll ponder on it and I'll hit back if I have any other questions.

How so? Isn't it the other way around? Price going up is due by more people buying in and the supply not being able to answer to the demand, so the trust is what makes price go up, not the other way around?

It depends, if you look at it from the point of view of someone who invested, the fact that its price is rising is confirming his decision, while someone not yet in might be afraid that,  because of its volatility, it's a bubble about to burst (even though "a bubble about to burst" has been repeated over and over the past 4 years ��).

That's actually very interresting. But doesn't that argument, since it's applicable to any crypto-currency, means Bitcoin is only here until there's a better alternative? (Less easily traced back to previous owners or stuff like that?)

So if I get it (I'm asking honest questions, not trolling in any way) the very fact that it has an alternative structure, unaffected by political or banking "maneuver" is what gives it value (or one of the reasons)?
