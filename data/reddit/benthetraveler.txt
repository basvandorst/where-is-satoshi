Valve will not only revoke the games, they will ban your entire account because of fraud.
There is still the possibility that OP sells second or third tier country keys (Russia, Hong Kong etc.= which isn't legal but Valve isn't really punishing it too hard.

Well you'd have to pay for 2 currency exchanges at least (because whoever is buying ruble right now is trading it for USD/EU asap). So it's cheaper and better to just directly get USD/EU.

Economies of countries are not like the 5 dollars you get from your mom and dad. You don't "spend within your means" because if you do that there is not only no growth but rather financial collapse. Debt is an integral part of every economy that existed in the past thousand years or longer.

They don't have a huge interest in dismissing BC. It's nothing to them. Honestly it's surprising they even waste time on a memo.
People need to do basic research, the amount of nonsense in this thread is insane. At least read the wikipedia page.
Just to put it into perspective: JP Morgans net income (not their assets, not their equity, their fucking net income) is 3-4 times bigger then the bitcoin market cap. It's a fart to them and not even a sandcorn for the entire financial sector.
Please. Get things into perspective, otherwise people will never ever take you seriously.

What would be the point? Somebody initiate a charge, I'd give my bank notice and initate a chargeback, whoever initiated it will get to deal with creditcard fraud and my bank will issue me a new card at no cost. So where exactly is my risk? And where exactly is trust required?
Nowhere. One day when you are old enough for a creditcard you'll find out how convenient it is. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 00:14:16
"Reporting on facts" - it's like you are writing satire. No wonder there are so many bitcoin scams.

I'm sure he is shocked that a poor nobody will tune out. Maybe he'll contact you personally and you can maybe give him a second chance.
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:38:06


But then you either lost the difference between the price when you first bought the btc or you lose money because the store that accepts btc needs a slightly above market exchange in order to secure itself against volatility. This doesn't solve the problem at all and you are paying more for it. :/

They will and they did. It's the reason why you should never ever accept gifts from strangers. Because some like to troll, gift something, chargeback the cc and fuck somebody over.

There is nothing to understand. You are making a decision to make all available fiat into Bitcoin. Nobody is forcing you to do that. And because you are doing that you are losing a lot of money. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:04:59
There is always SR, but obviously the need of SR is much smaller than the current Bitcoin hype. But BC can be used to trade real tangible assets and products. Provided the speculation stops, ironically.

As somebody how has lived some years in China and follows Chinese news this is total nonsense.
Basically the party bans BC because they don't want the population to invest in a bubble. Inb4: Not a bubble!!1 - this is China. China is crazy when it comes to investments. 
If it was just for buying and selling whatever you want on the net they wouldn't give a flying fuck. But since the local population would go crazy shit would hit the fan fast. And the small middleclass gets really pissed when it gets fucked over. So far only a bunch of techsavy T1-city folks have lost their gambling money, no harm done. Keep it going? The middleclass gets fucked. And when they get fucked they start to fuck shit up. The party knows and it basically says "lets not get it this far".
This has nothing to do of the "fear of the disruptive power of Bitcoin" (circlejerk much) but everything with the "many people doing stupid things is a recipe for desaster".
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:40:36

Making the only valid point for deflation. I would gift you gold but I'm holding my bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:07:50
But you making a choice - living solely off Bitcoin. If you were smart you wouldn't - you would use the fiat money that is not deflationary to pay rent and eat. And keep the bitcoin which is deflationary. Nobody is forcing you to throw away money. You are doing that on your own behalf. Which is your right, but don't expect that everybody else will act this irrational.
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:15:58

Your observation was your personal opinion backed by nothing but your gut feeling. You feel the post you linked is "more thoughtful". That's cool for you to think, but that doesn't mean it's true. What's more if all your post does is being contrarian for the sake of being contrarian you really shouldn't expect anything but downvotes.
