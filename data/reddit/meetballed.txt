Yes, Fiat currency relies on the faith of people that it has value. But it is backed by the government and they can essentially create more money. So you do see currencies that hyperinflate because of irresponsible expansion of the money supply. Like Zimbabwe. 
That said, for a lot of first world economies, the governments are not total twats. The goods and services produced in the economy are supported and measured by the currencies. You pay debt with the currency. It has legal tender. Being backed by the government is good enough and will be for the next hundred years.

Yes when I read this post and OP said he was an economist, and proceeded to read a sack of shit, I'm really really Glad I read your comment and that it has gotten visibility. Because not enough people seem to know this. As an economist myself, I find people and topics in this sub are egregiously biased in their views. 
A good dose of reality is what people need. Thanks for educating the masses. I completely agree with your views.

It's true. If there is no obvious underlying cause for a sharp increase in a short period of time, chances Are that the movement is supported on behaviour of people rather than the asset. 
The timeframe is the key thing here. 1500% over decades is different from 1500% overnight. There's absolutely no good reason for it to increase that much and that fast overnight. 
Now I've been seeing a lot of posts and comments in this sub and it appears dangerously similar to a closed group (like a cult). Don't be impervious to the risks. Stop memeing and worshipping this as a revolution. I have bought bitcoin myself and I think you should be aware of the risks.

Too bad he has vested interest in bitcoin to really know what he is talking about

Bitcoin is not a very good medium of exchange. Hopefully it will get there one day. This has nothing to do with holding bitcoin. The more ppl hold bitcoin in hopes of it appreciating, the less it is used as a kind of currency. 
Think you lack quite a fundamental economic understanding

It already is. A wildly fluctuating one

You can still have US debt with bitcoin. If there’s no fiat even governments will have to use bitcoin. They’ll still need to borrow currency for their expenditures. 
But they’ll lose control over the currency and run into real debt problems like Greece because they can’t control the currency anymore. Debt isn’t a problem as people make it out to be as long as the government has control. 
Why’s this even a thing to be associated with bitcoin?

I doubt any bank would actually say that since they deal with mostly credit anyway

Says the guy working for etoro. Lol. Just like that john McAfee guy who invested in shit ton of bitcoins and kept predicting it going up

I think most people who own bitcoin actually want both to coexist.
Don’t get me wrong I’m well aware of the rhetoric that somehow bitcoin is anti fiat. But yet bitcoin hodlers cheer whenever the price of a bitcoin (priced in USD terms) goes up.
I think a lot of people are actually very confused.

What problem is being solved exactly ?

They can restrict the free operation of exchanges and wallets which will really limit how people have access to it. Outside of the existing infrastructure which is already quite complicated for the average user, banning those will significantly reduce the amount of users. They can’t stop bitcoin but can they can make it much harder for everyone to trade it and kill it that way.

Ladies and gentleman. The irony and confusion in this bitcoin cult is perfectly personified by OP. 
If you are not selling I hope it means you are spending it. You are after all all strong believers in bitcoin As opposed to fiat. So please tell me you Are using it for your daily expenses. If you are just hoarding it in hopes thAt the value just continues to appreciate based on how other people use and adopt it, then you’re just a hypocrite. 
This is exactly why deflationary assets are not good for the economy and for currency. People just want to hoard it and not spend it. currency is useless if it isn’t spent and if you don’t spend you will kill the economy.
Oh and let’s see how bitcoin is being used by strong bitcoin advocates. Selling it. For USD. For fiat. I mean yea Op is not selling it because he wants to be able to get rid of it for more usd in the future. You get the point.

You know what else would be a failed monetary system? A deflationary one !

Any news on what we should do? Should we move btc out of Coinbase? It appears that there are 2 scenarios
1) there's no support for the new network so Coinbase will not support the new bitcoin. You could potentially "lose" your new bitcoin 
2) there's enough mining support and Coinbase will support the new coin

How is bitcoin even a bank

First one depicts inflation. Which in Low amounts is healthy for the economy as it encourages spending. As someone here pointed out, the problem is stagnant wages. If your income doesn’t grow to keep in line with inflation you are worth less and less over time. But that doesn’t stop you for investing your cash in assets that continue to appreciate. That’s generally how you beat inflation. Even “investing” in bitcoin is a way to beat inflAtion if the we assume the asset appreciates at a rate greater than inflation. 
This meme how assumes bitcoin as an asset is comparable to fiat when it is not. Bitcoin is not used as money although it can. It is a deflationary as shown in the bottom picture. If bitcoin is used like currency and is generally deflationary, that’s really bad for the economy. I wonder if people who love to compare bitcoin to cash and think this is a selling point actually know how the economy works? If money is deflationary people less incentive to spend. And the economy goes into a contraction cycle.

The thing that motivated me to want to transfer my coin out after buying it was storage and security. Another big problem with bitcoin. I don't feel safe storing my coin anywhere. And moving coin around is so expensive. I don't see how any of this is conducive to bitcoin being mainstream. This is just what Bitcoin appears to be at face value, to a regular person like me. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 13:20:04
Wake up sheeple. This sub loves to talk about how subversive bitcoin is, and how it will take over fiat as an alternative to fiat. That's currency used for things like grocery shopping. 
If you're comparing it to gold then it's a different class of assets. Youre then just hoping it's intrinsic value (in terms of USD btw) goes up for no reason when there's no real utility. Yea sure I Guess it's just a store of some hypothetical value.  A bit like gold but not quite. But sure it's like gold. Then it's not replacing fiat. 
Make up your minds sheeple

Except there is huge exchange risk if you actually tried that in the real world.

How is it bitcoin usable again?
