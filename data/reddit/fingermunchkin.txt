Don't be a propagandist.  It won't look good if it happens.

I don't think he is either but if he moves the coins or signs them and workable ideas come from him then he would clearly be Satoshi.

LMFAO!  
Edit:  If anyone publicly took that position, they'd be laughed at so hard.  That would be the most obvious propaganda.  
Now, at this point though, the only way any effort led by Craig Wright should succeed would be IF he signed a message with Satoshi's keys or he moved the coins.  So, there is that.  If he does though, the crypto world will bow to him and anyone countering him will be laughed at.

Unless he signs with Satoshi's keys or moves the coins.  If you don't bow at that point, no one will respect you and you'll be laughed at and deservedly so.

It's not going to work out well for Blockstream if nChain is set up and then Craig moves Satoshi's coins proving his identity.  That would be...interesting.

...or you could just increase the total block throughput like LiteCoin has by 4.  Real simple to do.

You can't believe that.  Wow...such propaganda.  Look, I don't think Craig Wright is Satoshi.  However, if he moves the coins and workable ideas come from him, then I will believe.  Anything less would be pure propaganda.    
For what it's worth, I don't think he'll ever move or sign anything.
