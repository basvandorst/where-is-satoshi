@_date: 2014-01-30 22:53:28
I got that, but also from the OP, he said company may keep some of it as bitcoins, gold, etc. Are they a merchant or a speculator?!
@_date: 2014-01-08 09:46:06
He didn't say the main reason for them "adopting" BitPay (not really Bitcoin) around the end of 2014 - cheap PR. As mainstream media picks up any (I really mean *any*) Bitcoin story, the entire planet was reminded that Overstock is still in business. I've never bought anything from them, they don't come up in Google Shopping either (well, after Google started charging for it). So, it was purely a PR move. Why announce 10+ months in advance? Yes, I'm sure their e-commerce system is possibly overcomplicated, but 10+ months for a new payment method is more like a "wait-and-see" at best!
@_date: 2014-01-15 03:23:04
Well, you may believe in the long-term viability, yet, monetize from the dips as this is the only way you can increase the number of bitcoins you own.

Yeah, can't wait for Circle to launch!

Technical issues in something as basic as Bitcoin transfers don't take weeks to get resolved, really? They don't promise this to get solved by Monday either - they are going to give another update by then! Combined with the huge delays in fiat withdrawals, this whole thing starts to stink! I am afraid that a few weeks ago when there was a security hole discovered allowing account take over ( it is possible that bitcoins were stolen and Mt.Gox covered it up, and now they are struggling what to do. Just a hypothesis, I know - I'm just trying to put the facts together.
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:28:28
No, that's not true - the Feds won't use an exchange.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:21:01
The press releases returns 404s, i.e. definitely not due to a traffic surge. Add the wiped clean Twitter feed. Why are they deleting evidence that has millions of copies already?!
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:43:55
They've been talking about the so-called Midas engine for months. It was supposed to go out in mid-December. They are a bunch of incapable developers. Huobi built a way more solid platform in just months!

So funny. "Ignore Gox", then "Follow Gox". Crash again on Monday when there's no word from Gox.

@_date: 2014-01-09 22:15:35
Really? First, why spend your bitcoins when you can spend your fiat. Just for the sport? Flood Coinbase with sell orders? Second, Overstock.com and Amazon.com are totally different marketplaces - you can't compare. People were buying from Amazon.com and not from Overstock.com for quite different reasons.
@_date: 2014-01-17 07:02:42

@_date: 2014-01-29 22:52:59
Yeah, but given the numbers, sales are declining since the beginning, not keeping the same pace!
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:11:37
Yeah, but people are not lining up to buy Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:49:25

@_date: 2014-01-23 03:07:19
You aren't either, so, I don't see your point. Plus, did you read this? 
@_date: 2014-01-17 00:55:12
I'm not sure why people always downvote me when I say that at least exchanges needs to be regulated. For example, we know OKCoin was faking volume, Huobi is suspected to fake it, too. This is my least concern. They can also manipulate the price in the direction they want easily. People put tons of money in the exchanges and playing a Russian roulette doing so. Just try to image what will happen if one of the top 5 exchanges gets hacked or steals the coins or something similar! It will be a disaster for so many people and especially for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:57:38
I think they had balanced deposits and withdrawals, maybe somebody was exploiting the TM long ago, but when people started to flee Mt.Gox, the balance broke, and they had no other option, but to stop withdrawals, hoping to recover by this scheme that's going on right now.
@_date: 2014-01-18 00:34:01
There's nothing wrong in selling when you can buy more bitcoins with the same dollars. This is the best strategy to teach panic sellers a lesson, I think.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:35:34
Depleting people of their hard-earned wealth using your insider position is not cool and is unfair. Just read some of the comments at Bitcoin Forums to see that I'm not the only one thinking this way!
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:06:49
@_date: 2014-02-01 18:24:44
If you've seen the upcoming improvements in version 0.9, there will be a lot more information leaked about merchant transactions! Mixers will be illegal and the position will be - if you want privacy, please, stick with the banking system! Regarding credit cards - can we stop spreading disinformation in hopes that people are stupid and never used credit cards? If somebody steals my credit card, I'm not responsible for it. Yeah, it may take a phone call to take care of the issue, but I'm responsible in theory for up to $50, which in practice it is $0! Let's assume, people start using Bitcoin - just imagine the flood of articles of people getting their coins stolen by trojans, losing their paper wallets, forgetting their passwords, etc., i.e. a lot of horror stories that will keep the rest away from Bitcoin. People still use passwords like "letmein" and are unaware or too lazy to implement 2FA! I follow closely Bitcoin Forums and this subreddit - many people, supposedly much more intelligent and careful than the average Joe get their coins stolen. Ignoring this risk will be fatal for Bitcoin. Instead of ignoring it, a solution should be found, and a tremendous effort should be put in consumer education.
@_date: 2014-01-28 06:40:09
I keep getting downvotes as people don't like opinions they're not comfortable with, but I honestly don't care. The truth is that Bitcoin is not decentralized. There are only a few exchanges that set the price and those are manipulated by a few "whales" who can play the market with as little as a few hundred BTC. Then, you have the mining pools. Two of the largest pools are over 50% already. In the states, you're pretty much stuck with Coinbase, which charges arm and leg. Also, it's not practical to use a desktop app for Bitcoin - it takes forever to sync and storage requirements are growing pretty rapidly. If you use Electrum, it's using their servers to sync, i.e. it's not decentralized, but most would use Coinbase, Coinkite, or Blockchain.info. Anyway, just hang out on Bitcoin Forums to see how many people get their bitcoins stolen. It doesn't matter if you have 2FA or not, trojans, key loggers, wallet backups, etc. - it's not safe and you need to be a total geek to do things right. Same say - buy a separate computer that's disconnected from the internet. Well, how is this free or cheap? I don't need a second computer to bank. Even if somebody compromises my credit card or bank account, I'm safe! Imagine when more average Joes start to use Bitcoin - the media will be flooded with horror stories! People still use passwords like "letmein' and you expect them to protect their bitcoins? No freakin' way! People are stupid! Well, most people, at least - by definition!
@_date: 2014-01-15 02:53:16
I can't agree more! I linked my Coinbase to two services (one being BitWall), but... can you really trust any service with the omnipotent API key and OAuth without restrictions? Also, I'm not sure if they show activity based on OAuth authorization and API key - this would be great, too!
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:58:34
You haven't heard about S curve?
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:26:57
One more thing: when my vendor charges me X dollars for a product and I sell with a modest margin of 10-15%, I cannot afford to accept bitcoins directly without the financial risk of actually ending up selling on loss. If I use Coinbase or BitPay, I still end up hitting the ACH time frames, so, it makes no difference other than expanding my market reach to the niche that has no credit/debit card as they hoard bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-01-31 08:00:44
Well, if they've implemented Google Wallet, for example, we wouldn't have seen something like this as there's no loyal fan base that will rush buy in order to support.

Same reason as before - speculation.
@_date: 2014-01-24 04:08:02
No, you're wrong. I follow ZeroBlock.com. You should, too. On a side note, why do you take everything so personally?
@_date: 2014-02-21 01:35:15
Well, it's possible that they've been doing this in the past, but have lost due to the unpredictable market, so, there's another possibility for missing coins. Even with virtual funds (BTC or USD), if you can't successfully manipulate the market, you can still lose, and owe people real funds.
@_date: 2014-01-23 06:05:41
Well, let's see what happens in less than two weeks as China is still the market maker.
@_date: 2014-01-11 02:52:02
Yes, but imagine if GHash.IO and BTC Guild gang up - they currently have 51% total.
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:09:42
BTC-e is in based in Bulgaria as the government there is totally clueless especially when it comes to new technology and if they have to bribe, it will be cheaper there. Also, taxes in Bulgaria are 10% if they have to pay anything as, again, the government is clueless. Also, Bulgaria has a pretty cheap and fast internet and some of the best developers. Anyway, BTC-e is a Cyprus offshore company - just like most big shady businesses in Bulgaria as to some people even 10% is a tax rate too high!
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:55:23
Oh, so, stopping trading, emptying their Twitter feed, no PR yesterday, etc. are all coincidences.
@_date: 2014-01-28 06:10:22
The reason I got turned off by Bitcoin is that it attracts all the greedy and the lazy to make money in a more sane way than just to HODL! I'm coming from the startup world, yes, everybody likes money, but money is not the first, not even the second priority! Bitcoin is all about making quick big profits without much effort. Sorry, but this isn't how you build a sustainable ecosystem! I also have paid to Coinbase more fees than I've ever paid to all banks times 10! And I got way worse customer service for all that money! And they just keep getting worse (ridiculous fees, limits, etc.)
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:47:28
Well-planned operation or not, either scenario is pretty bad. I really hope if Gox.com ever relaunches, people to be smart enough to stay away of it and VCs to exile Mark who caused billions of lost value in addition to the ~700K bitcoins! Even if they had bugs like any piece of software does, what kind of checks and balances system did you put in place to miss such a huge loss?!
@_date: 2014-01-13 09:40:54
And why the heck not? It's not like Bitcoin is regulated. We all know that this works well for Max Keiser.
@_date: 2014-03-04 09:20:40
I can't believe how positively the market reacted! It's not like a major retailer is accepting Litecoin or similar - just one defunct exchange adds Litecoin and everybody rushes to buy (and will soon be sorry when the euphoria dies off).
@_date: 2014-02-13 23:05:05
Of course it could be used if you have a shared Escrow wallet or several wallets! When you have bitcoins with a marketplace or exchange, your balance does not correspond to the balance of a wallet that belongs to you. If you trick the marketplace/exchange that your withdrawal failed, when it actually happened, you can keep retrying until you deplete the Escrow wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:34:46
Yes, it does.
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:20:41
You're stupid. I sold all my bitcoins at peak.
@_date: 2014-01-30 22:59:19
Well, yes, and why do they have poor financial earnings? Duh! Because obviously management isn't doing a good job! Instead of putting 40 engineers in a room to increase their sales by 1%, they should've long ago put their effort into getting in Google search results as I haven't seen or heard about them before the free Bitcoin PR in years! The guy obviously is more interested in his personal wealth investing in Bitcoin and using the company's resources to pump it versus doing a good job at what he's getting paid for! Google changed their search engine algos long ago and Google Shopping became a paid service long ago. You don't see Amazon in Google Shopping, because people just go straight to Amazon to search, but eBay is there, and unpopular sheet vendors like Overstock.com should've followed the other serious merchants who are focused on commerce basics and not on speculation and trying too hard to get free PR!
@_date: 2014-01-23 18:41:04
The only piece of news in the article is the last paragraph.
@_date: 2014-01-17 23:03:33
Coinbase uses Bitstamp. If Bitstamp cannot handle 30K bitcoins, doesn't this speak loudly about market's liquidity, and interest in Bitcoin? I think Bitcoin diehards should be excited, but I guess everybody has mixed feelings as everybody wishes the Feds will use a method to get rid of their coins without affecting the market negatively. I don't think an asset, which has a legitimate marketplace will be auctioned. I expect them to start selling in 1K BTC batches via Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-01-31 00:24:13
Their Bitcoin sales are actually declining since they implemented Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:11:12
My point is - there are already functional exchanges, some of them having superior technology (Kraken, Coinsetter), so, if there are regulatory issues, given some already operate in the same state (like CoinMKT.com, for example, which is in California like Kraken), it's all about hiring top-notch lawyers and compliance experts, I think. Instead of starting a gazillion exchanges and take forever for them to gain credibility and attract liquidity, efforts should be consolidated to help the existing ones, I think!
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:37:47
The thing is that those billions of dollars are virtual wealth. The more hoarders spend, you will see a dead cat bounce of the price unless the general public starts buying in, but, so far, there are no such indications and it's very simple - the average Joes are incapable of safeguarding their computers and they won't put money in something with no guarantee.
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:06:31
It's rather simple: VPs don't discuss things like this via emails with strangers. If that guy knows those VPs, he would not compromise his relationship with them posting emails to public forums in a desperate market manipulation attempt.

@_date: 2014-01-08 22:11:27
Well, given most of volume is heavily discounted, average cannot be 2.9% + $0.30 - that was my point.
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:55:28
It is. What happens behind the scene is not exchanging goods for bitcoins - it's Coinbase selling your bitcoins and giving the dollars to Overstock. By increasing the Bitcoin sales, you're also dragging the price down. Silk Road used Bitcoin as a medium of exchange as it increased the demand for Bitcoin, not the supply.
@_date: 2014-02-21 01:43:13
The general public doesn't really care about Bitcoin yet, i.e. you can't lose something you don't have.
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:00:39
It doesn't need to get killed. When price keep dropping, it will die on its own as, let's be honest at last, nobody's interested in it unless the price keeps climbing up.
@_date: 2014-02-24 07:45:49
Yeah, I saw that, which is pretty bad news on its own!
@_date: 2014-01-14 21:58:26
Basically the article is repeating the same thing over and over again and self-promoting their service. Wall Street will not put money in to play with each other - they need "stupid" capital to flow in from small fish first and it seems nobody is interested in buying above $1,000.
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:13:17
Thanks, but no thanks! CointMkt charges 2% compliance fee (!) and still takes 3-5 business days not considering the time needed for buying a money order and mailing it!

BTC China? The smallest Chinese exchange by volume with the biggest mouth?
@_date: 2014-01-18 00:24:56
Okay, but if they find a stash of cash in Euro, are they gonna auction it? I just tried putting 30,000 BTC in Coinbase and it offered me $455.97 BTC/USD rate (well, in addition to the 1% fee). Well, I'm ignoring the 50 BTC/day limit for the mere mortals.
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:53:29
Really? You drive on roads, you go to school, you can healthcare, social security, police patrol your city, criminals go behind bars, army is funded to protect the country, etc. It's not theft and 10% is very reasonable.
@_date: 2014-01-15 03:40:40
BTW, in an interview of Walt Mossberg with Coinbase's CEO, it was said that 80% of Coinbase customers have never spent a bitcoin, i.e. there was no balance in bids and asks. When more merchants integrate Bitcoin, there will be more asks as a share, I think, so, maybe they can the ability to fulfill internally at a much bigger profit. Maybe in the future they implement some other optimization that will delay orders to increase their margin, who knows, but it's risky, and I think their business is different, so, the cleanest solution would be to directly use an exchange. I won't be surprised if they have an agreement with Bitstamp to process their orders with a higher priority, i.e. before taking from the order book or processing other market orders.
@_date: 2014-01-10 08:34:54
BTW, the Instant Buy limit is weekly, so, you're not gonna wait another day to get another bitcoin, but 7 days, instead.
@_date: 2014-01-10 16:53:40
I got a canned response in less than 12 hours - there's an improvement! Basically they say, it's been noted that you requested an increase, if we ever do anything, you'll get an email. Their FAQ is wrong, too, as the limit was 10 BTC Instant Buy per week and their FAQ says "the limit used to be 10 BTC per day". No, not at all. It was 10 BTC per week and every few hours they were giving you parts of that 10 BTC/week limit, which was a bit more than 1 BTC/day effectively.
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:28:34
Now I see why somebody is selling over 9K BTC at Bitstamp.
Edit: Removed the $.
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:01:20
Well, tell this to the funds that acquired millions at prices above $800!
@_date: 2014-02-18 04:07:30
Not really. I like the technology and I'm working on Bitcoin projects. All you like is the price. So, I'm a true believer and you're the actual speculator taking the lazy way to some hypothetical wealth.

Yup. Should rebrand to Mt.Ponzi.

@_date: 2014-01-31 07:58:11
I think if BTC China tried to fake it, they did a very poor job! It screams "fake" or "bot war"!
@_date: 2014-02-18 04:06:20
It surely does. I sold over $1,100 and can buy now and double, yet, I think it's overpriced at the moment.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:36:15
Mark, it's still theft! If you get more money than you're supposed to and don't give it back, you're effectively a thief.
@_date: 2014-01-29 22:19:50
Discounting everything is also dangerous. If people have 2 BTC and are willing to spend it hoping to hack other people's wallets - it's totally fine with me. Anyway, in cryptography, nothing is safe forever. There are commercial quantum computers now, science advances exponentially, traditional computing power grows exponentially as well - thanks for looking into this, but we should be careful not to discount real threats by asking forums to ban everybody who has claims like Evil-Knievel!

The market is pretty predictable, there are some repeating patterns, and could be highly profitable even without big swings. Unless you fall into one of these categories: a) too greedy; b) too loyal to Bitcoin (and missing opportunities); c) too panicky.
@_date: 2014-01-18 03:15:21
I know; my point was that this isn't news.
@_date: 2014-01-13 16:57:56
This is just not true. If more people adopt Bitcoin, they can transfer money wallet to wallet - now many use PayPal and PayPal wants to rule the person-to-person market.
@_date: 2014-05-26 05:37:08
Oh, so if it's not speculation, then regular folk cared 30% more about Bitcoin last week? LOL
@_date: 2014-05-06 03:05:34
Usually they ban things on Thursday.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:55:06
It doesn't seem to have a big effect on the price yet (Chinese exchanges really don't seem to care much), but I'm sure tomorrow things will get worse when this hits the mainstream media and see everybody dispensing the usual crap. Fortunately though, this will allow more people to enter the market at lower prices, which will be good for the ecosystem. But let's hope that more bad news don't come out in the next week or two!
@_date: 2014-01-15 07:19:48

How much I sold is something Coinbase, my CPA, and IRS are entitled to know. Unlike many in this subreddit, I don't rely on Bitcoin to make a decent living - I have skills other than hoarding coins in hopes!
@_date: 2014-01-13 07:25:14
I dug further. It came out that previously Huobi had two bank accounts - a personal one of the CEOs, and a business one (not sure why they needed two, but it could be something specific to China such as higher rates, etc.), and they removed the personal one, i.e. the business one is still available for deposits.
@_date: 2014-01-17 10:16:29
You need to correct the title. Well, the screenshot proves how immature Coinbase is, but the fact is that they would still make a decent profit even with this price discrepancy as they charge 1% each way, i.e. even if they lose $2 on the rate, they will make 1% on $813 and 1% on $815, i.e. they still make $14.28 per 1 BTC!

In addition to the 1% fee, they also have a markup on top of Bitstamp price - sometimes as high as 2%.

Sell fake, buy real, keep the difference in real coins. After a few such rounds, he'll make up for the missing coins at the expense of the investors with stuck coins there.
@_date: 2014-01-15 03:46:05
I'm not making anything up. It's all over Hacker News and their Twitter feed admitted Mt.Gox and Bitstamp. There's also a guy who submitted a security report and he said he worked with Coinbase and Bitstamp to fix plug the hole.

@_date: 2014-02-20 09:50:32
With balances of BTC and USD in a computer system without backing and as long as there ware no withdrawals, he can do whatever he wants to recover the loses. Just imagine this: he adds fake Bitcoins and fake dollars to his account and trades. As long as his balances at the end are higher or the same, he's basically stolen either fiat or bitcoins from his customers. Of course, this doesn't remove the possibility of him buying with fake dollars and selling for real dollars elsewhere, but this is easy to track down. The internal trading is harder to prove and cleaner.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:49:45
Interesting, but makes sense as you won't hear people complaining about getting more bitcoins. Jesus!
@_date: 2014-01-28 07:32:35
Well, again, as a I said, technology startups usually don't seek profit in the beginning and given the greed and the type of crowd that gets attracted by Bitcoin (just hang out at BTC-e trollbox to see who you're dealing with), it may not go past the Innovator's phase!
@_date: 2014-01-13 09:31:00
He might be. Or he might just be drunk (he tweeted after 11:30pm) as people showed emails from PayPal stating the opposite (in reply to his first part of the tweet).
@_date: 2014-01-15 06:27:14
The way I read is as negative. Basically they never said they're gonna ban Bitcoin! This reaffirms that they are gonna tighten the regulation and closely monitor to protect the people. January 31 restriction is still in effect. 2 weeks left!
@_date: 2014-01-22 21:24:51
Keep holding and hoping! Traumatic experiences lead to repressed memory! Many forgot the DotCom crash and those who still remember it can recall the same type of hype and the same type of mentality of the "investors". There's nothing new under the sun - greed beats reason every day of the week! It fell from $1,200 down to below $500 and it has since "recovered" to $800. Just wait a couple more weeks to see another round of "recovery"!
@_date: 2014-01-20 08:09:40
Very true, but major currencies vary by a lot less than a percent a day though plus you have the central banks to intervene. Also, Forex is the highest liquidity market with over a trillion dollars of turnover daily unlike Bitcoin exchanges that sometimes tank with the sale of just 500 BTC.

Yeah, I also read it that way. Maybe this is a way around insolvency, too. Get people to deposit litecoins, convert them to bitcoins elsewhere and not reveal the theft. I just don't get why he thinks that if people won't trust him with their bitcoins, they will with their litecoins! It's not like there aren't other exchanges like BTC-e or Kraken that support those already! I think the reason Mt.Gox was still in business is that old bots were programmed against its API - without a streaming API from Bitstamp, it's really hard to implement things as efficiently. Do you know who else has streaming API?
@_date: 2014-01-09 21:19:00
It's a lie anyway.
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:25:12
It's really tiring when every critic of the Bitcoin technology to be attacked with: "you're not getting it". No, this is a very valid issue! Transactions can be correlated - especially if a competitor has such interest. For example, if you want to sell those bitcoins at Bitstamp, the allow you to generate one deposit address in 24 hours. I'm not sure what BTC-e limitation was, but it seemed like a fixed address per account as far as I remember. I am also thinking that regulators will declare tumblers/mixers illegal based on the notion during the NYDFS hearings, so, this won't be an option for US-based merchants.

Well, the Chinese are doing their trick again. First, look at the price of OKCoin and Huobi - almost identical all the time. It's obvious they are full of phantom transactions. This is impossible with disconnected order books. Also, nobody ever said Bitcoin is gonna be banned and they still will be out of fiat starting next week, so, don't fall in their trap again buying high! The recharge codes they are talking about is what killed BTC China when they didn't have a bank account for a month or so. Internal transfers are not gonna help much either. Plus, the government doesn't like being considered stupid and exchanges always finding some workarounds making them a laughing stock. This optimism they are building up is to prepare for the real dump next week! Be wise, don't fall into it! People have millions of dollars invested in Bitcoin there and if you think they're gonna play fair - think again!

They don't ask you what type of account holder you are - they said 90% of their bitcoins are in cold storage. As we know, they sell at Bitstamp, i.e. at some point, if more than 10% of people decide to sell their bitcoins, there will put sales on hold until they start moving the next 10% in hot storage and by that time, the price could be quite different!

Their fee structure essentially gives BTC China 0% as it rewards those who buy (negative fee) and charges those who sell. If you trade (i.e. you buy and then sell), essentially, there's no fee. The fee would be assessed if you move your bitcoins from outside and sell it and cash out.

I don't think this is fair to people who are currently under a lot of stress regarding their funds at Mt.Gox! Also, it's not fair to Mt.Gox either. As we saw, many exchanges had similar issues as well and all this actually helps strengthen the ecosystem! Also, as Mark Karpeles said, the fact that they were open enough to show withdrawals actually was to their detriment! I am totally more disgusted by people like Roger Ver who are buying discounted bitcoins and dollars from people who have funds stuck at Mt.Gox! He's using insider info plus string-pulling to make extra profit at the expense of stressed out investors! This is not cool!

Read the original letter (if it's authentic, of course), not the comments translated by Google Translate.

A lot of those who spent bought their coins back (which is an expensive exercise if the price is not constantly going up), but price went down a bit anyway. I am not saying that merchants have no incentive (publicity or direct economical) to implement BitPay and Coinbase - it's actually a very easy and smart thing to do right now when all media will broadcast a story for free, but merchants with a lot more at stake will be waiting for some legitimacy. Here's what a very smart VC says about the whole thing (Keith Rabois):

You understand he can drop immense amounts of fake Bitcoins on the market and give priority on his trades. It can be done. He can also use  as well (assuming he has any real bitcoins left). We know with TM fiat was not stolen, so, I think he used Roger Ver to make some quick fiat as well (he was offering to buy discounted goxBTC and goxUSD over at Bitcoin Forums) and they are close buddies.

Yes, NXT sounds like a great idea. You can't claim that Bitcoin is decentralized when there are only a handful of exchanges and the price of Bitcoin is dictated by them. I get downvoted every time I say that I do not trust any of the existing liquid exchanges. Coinsetter and Kraken look great, I trust them a gazillion times more than Bitstamp, BTC-e, and Mt.Gox, but they don't have the liquidity. If you really want a system that's hard or impossible to manipulate, the exchanges need to stay in the past and Bitcoin exchange should be entirely P2P! Also, my making this distributed, you remove speculators out as you can't do high-speed trading with a distributed marketplace. Last, but not least - I wish there was a way to get rid of the mining pools. I hope the technology finds a solution of distributed coordination that removes the need of the pools that are also a weak link in the system! GHash.io is creepy - based in Ukraine, I just don't trust it! (I'm Eastern European, so, I'm not discriminating my kind, I just know it more intimately to trust it!)

I agree that regulation in this country equals hundreds if not millions of dollars - all going into the greedy sleazy lawyers! The problem is that the media picks up all the sensational stuff and without some level of consumer protection, class action lawsuits will follow, which will destroy startups, and all the negative coverage will stop any adoption or desire to do any innovation. If there's regulation on the entry/exit level, i.e. buying and selling bitcoins, then the actual startups can be anywhere on the planet. The real issue is buying and selling bitcoins, everything else you can already do using companies all over the place - Elliptic Vault for storage, Coinkite for banking, Bitstamp for trading, etc.

You haven't heard of Coinsetter, Kraken, CoinMKT, Circle? There's also Cryptsy, CampBX, and Atomic-Trade (just launched). There are a lot of US-based exchanges, just regulation does not make it easy to deal with fiat.

What's the news though? It hasn't been going smoothly so far?
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:23:31
Even if they don't deal with fiat, I'm sure they will have this way before Barry comes out with something. CoinMKT has a maker-taker fee structure, which is great. They are working on ACH transfers and I'm sure most complains are their 2% compliance fee for fiat deposits in some cases.
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:09:40
Yes, given the competition from BitPay, but I wonder why Overstock went with Coinbase, when BitPay has a flat-fee service!

You should be checking out Hacker News more often - at least one post a day is about Bitcoin and given Coinbase is a YCombinator startup, you can see a lot of credible info there. For example, customer service responds there in nearly realtime.

Yes, your bank can help by doing the reverse ACH if they want, but if that account is empty, as far as I know, they will incur additional costs due to NSF, and reversal will fail anyway.

Oh, there's a huge psychological difference - that's why Google are doing a stock split in a few months! Nobody wants to buy something priced at $1,000+. It's nice that you've set up a target of $10K for yourself, but it's obvious that most people don't even think $1K is just.

Not really. It's not as much the accepting part than the conversion to fiat. This is where Coinbase and BitPay shine, but that's not really a pro-Bitcoin fact as at then end, all these companies are accepting USD, not Bitcoin.

I doubt that. I think $1M USD is a pretty good compromise already. At the end, Coinbase needs to make profit, too, and if Overstock is claiming false 1-2% margin, we know Coinbase's really is in that range!

The fact that they give 5% back means that 1% isn't as much for them as people think! 7 TPS is there to reduce the growth of the blockchain. Imagine it increases to 1,000 TPS - can you even imagine the size of blockchain? My bitcoinqt needs days to sync up - imagine if 10x, 100x, 1,000x growth with mass adoption. This will make Bitcoin centralized, i.e. people will use blockchain.info wallet, not the desktop client as the desktop client will become impractical to use. My point - with rapid growth, Bitcoin might be in theory decentralized, but it will turn into a pretty centralized system quickly!

The guy is totally uninformed. First, swiped transactions are much lower than online processing fees. I'm sure Target pays no more than 1.5% + $0.15 per transaction, not the 2.9% + $0.30 the guy lists. Second, when it comes to retail, things are way more complicated than uninformed bystanders can ever imagine. Anyway, whoever says Bitcoin transaction processing is free is uninformed. Also, my wife credit card got compromised at Target... so what? She got a new card and then Target offered discounts - big deal! I don't see less people at Target although it's not the Holiday Season. Also, Costco only takes American Express credit cards and they have a deal with them - just like Sam's Club has with Discover. Anyway, keep hoping, but it's not gonna happen anytime soon - especially with Bitcoin's technical limitation of 7 TPS! Oh, one more thing - Target has debit and credit cards that give you 5% discount. This should be telling you something!
@_date: 2014-02-24 05:46:35
Are you living under a rock?! Other exchanges have implemented the TM fix in days, not weeks, and have forgotten about it already! It's not a big deal to implement it. It's obvious that that TM is just an excuse! So, there are two options: 1) Mark is manipulating the market to make a quick buck, but kills its business; 2) Mt.Gox is insolvent. Both are pretty bad and even if people are able to withdraw coins (with limits as they said), many have lost a lot of money and made Mark significantly richer. Also, trade volumes have drastically increased and he's milked a lot of transaction fees in result, too!

I can't actively use something that doesn't give me a decent cash back. I get 1.5% unlimited cash back with PayPal Debit Card, deposited monthly. Also, I get an email immediately after a purchase or authorization, so, fraud prevention is without a comparison. I also get something like a $1,000 credit limit until my funds arrive at PayPal (you don't need to have balance to use it), and so far, I've made nearly $10K in cash back, so, no fancy interface can beat the generous cash back on every dollar spent!

Only Huobi and a couple other exchanges are working around the issue by exposing their bank accounts. In fact, until a couple of days ago, Huobi listed the CEO's personal account as a deposit option as well, but he removed it. I'm not sure why BTC China and OKCoin didn't implement something like this already - it's not clear if Huobi will stop accepting deposits as of February 1.
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:48:52
It doesn't matter at what price you got them for - it matters at what price you can sell them now. So, don't do the wrong math, please! If you can sell for $800 today, what you buy for 1 BTC actually costs you $800 and you made $700 profit from the BTC sale, which is independent from the fact if you bought something at Overstock or just sold your bitcoins for fiat.
@_date: 2014-01-13 09:34:44

Instead of taking criticism constructively, the Bitcoin crowd usually tries to outshout the critic or use the cliche: "You simply don't get it." If people really believe in Bitcoin's viable future, they should welcome criticism, and try to improve the platform, but I guess people are so damned afraid that any negative information can negatively affect the fiat value of their stash, which proves them to be speculators and not true believers in Bitcoin.

Good news? Well, maybe for you personally. This is before the TM glitch was discovered and before the account takeover disclosure by Ego Homakov, plus, only coins could've been stolen with TM, not fiat. Also, the amount is important as well.

Coinbase buys from Bitstamp, at times they may even lose. Even this 1% isn't guaranteed profit. Once they have huge buy and sell volume, they may fulfill orders internally and profit, but even then often spread is way less than 1%, so, I'm not sure.

I know. I have 2FA on every single service that supports it. I highly recommend using Authy instead of Google Authenticator, but either and even just SMS is better than none! Google, Facebook, Twitter, Outlook, and many others support one form or another. For a financial service, this should be default behavior. Sometimes twisting arms is the best approach as people are lazy, some are naive, too optimistic, well, many are plain stupid, too. Maybe there should be a checkbox weaver if you decide to disable the enabled 2FA by default!
@_date: 2014-01-18 09:44:22
Well, true, but the difference is that the panic sellers think it's crashing and they won't buy until they get comfortable that it's not gonna crash further (they'd learned the fancy terms "dead cat bounce", "bull trap", etc.). At the end, they miss the moment and may buy even higher than they sold. I think greed and panic are bad advisers - modest profit is better.

I disagree that this is an exchange issue. I think what Mt.Gox was doing is what makes the most sense from most developers' point of view. A good piece of technology comes with built-in safeguards - if you rely on people implementing all the nitty-gritty details right to secure their implementation, they won't always do it right! Trust me, I've done software development for decades, and I know this happens all the time! I think blaming all this on Mt.Gox is unfair and doesn't do good to the ecosystem! They still have a significant trade volume, removing them from indexes and stuff is childish! There are way worse exchanges and we owe Mt.Gox a lot to the present success of Bitcoin! Let's not be ungrateful! Everybody loved Mt.Gox when its price was $100+ above any other; just like everybody loved China when they were driving the price high, and, suddenly, when these are not working for you, you start to bash them!

Doing this stuff is child's play with no penalty as there's no regulation.

Nobody has ever claimed that Bitcoin is better than cash for criminals. All claims have been that Bitcoin allows criminal activity online, which was previously only possible via offline payments.

@_date: 2014-01-11 04:00:16
This is not true. The banks got USD as Coinbase sold your bitcoins at Bitstamp (which involves international wire transfers and fees, but not for each individual order, of course) and did an ACH to Overstock's bank account. So, a lot of banks are, in fact, getting involved in this process. Don't kid yourself!

I thought it was a problem with Mt.Gox not implementing things, not with Bitcoin?!?
@_date: 2014-01-13 10:18:28
Yeah, he had a long meeting with the Compliance Department on Sunday night and tweeted to calm people down. Is this what you're suggesting? Give me a break! Bitcoin is competition. They may launch something like BitPay or even acquire it, I think Coinbase is a less attractive acquisition target, but, in general, especially with their "Gift Token" patent, I doubt as a corporation they are very excited about Bitcoin - especially when people compare transaction volumes of Bitcoin and PayPal! We'll see. I think it was easy for Overstock to implement Coinbase as their API is very simple to integrate with, but for PayPal to implement Bitcoin, it will take much much longer.

I personally think the problem of Bitcoin is its dual use both for speculation and commerce and these are not very compatible. Imagine if there was a service called Stockpay, which allows one to make purchases by selling some of their stock shares - nobody would have taken it seriously although it could've received decent PR, it's would've had a good story, and a niche market. Anyway, if PayPal implements Bitcoin, it won't be as simple of an implementation as Overstock's. Same with Western Union and Moneygram. There's no credible exchange in the US at this point, so, I wonder to see what Circle will come up with and I won't be surprised if they get acquired by PayPal if they offer something that closes the loop.

This is totally flawed! Moving funds from one address to another, mixing, etc., do not equate to real transactions like with PayPal and WU!

Early adopters need newcomers to increase the demand and the price, so, without new people who bought much later, Bitcoin would be still worth pennies.

That's true. So, we should hope that Satoshi never spends his then?
@_date: 2014-01-15 03:44:15
Obviously it is as over 80% of the people just bought and never spent, so, it may not be suitable for day trading, but weekly trading was possible until they reduced the limit from 10 BTC to 1 BTC.
@_date: 2014-01-15 03:27:33
Yes. Their rate is very close to Bitstamp with some buffer that changes with price velocity. Also, if you haven't noticed already, the rate changes with the amount of coins you want to buy/sell as it's based on the order book. I think they've used Mt.Gox at times, but given how hard it is now to get money out of there, it doesn't seem that they're using it. Ideally, they would sell at Mt.Gox and buy at Bitstamp.

This is not true. I may trust BitWall, but only to deposit, let's say, or withdraw max 0.01 BTC per day or just see my transactions (KryptoTax.com, for example), and similar. With PayPal, which Coinbase is supposed to compete with, I can specify up to what amount a merchant can charge.

I'm not taking about SEPA limits, I'm talking about Mt.Gox allowing smaller withdrawals to go out, i.e. large number of withdrawals, but low overall amount. Yesterday there was guy over Bitcoin Forums who got less than $2,000 as well and it took him over a month, too.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:00:10
Yes, everybody who doesn't have funds at Mt.Gox said "fuck Gox". Everybody's for themselves, unfortunately. The greedy who bought goxBTC on BitcoinBuilder got a life lesson, too. Oh, man, I can imagine the headlines tomorrow!

I joined Reddit more than 7 years ago, but haven't used it a lot as there was no need to. I recently joined and Bitcoin Forums and that was a stupid decision as both are nothing, but a circlejerk of greedy and incompetent people with some exceptions, of course, unlike Hacker News, where one can maintain a balanced and intelligent conversation in a company of one of the most intelligent technologists. Here, those who don't have "To the moon!" tattooed on their brain are downvoted crazy! You all advertise Bitcoin like a tool for global democracy, freedom from greedy governments and banks, but the Bitcoin community is the most free-speech suppressing one, the one least tolerant for a different opinion, and that is what turns off a lot of technology people like me who really would not want to be associated with this kinda crowd here. Also, Hacker News is a better conversational platform as you need to earn your right to downvote! You're the trolls, I am not. I say what I think and you say what suits you afraid that the truth can ruin your early retirement plans!

1/10th of Huobi and lower than Bitstamp and BTC-e. I looked at all exchanges, BTC China is  now - it used to be 
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:46:01
Well, it would be interesting - A Russian guy, starting a company in Bulgaria, that's actually a Cyprus offshore company. The reason nobody should trust BTC-e is even more pathetic - no physical address, no phone number, no management team, zero information. Bitcoin isn't some illegal business - I don't understand why they don't provide any bit of legitimacy and it's one of the largest exchanges now - imagine what would happen if they decide to keep the coins and disappear. Their 0.2% fee (the lowest outside of China) isn't a good insurance that they will stay in business.
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:18:00
You don't see it? Mining gets consolidated, wallets get consolidated - how is this any different than my bank?! Basically, most of the promises of Bitcoin are not holding up! Anonymity, decentralization, hard to manipulate, etc. Any market is and is gonna be manipulate with people who own most of it - Bitcoin or any other. If you don't accept that basic truth, well, I'm not sure how I can help you! Bitcoin made sense when it was niche, when Big Money weren't getting involved. When I heard Wall Street gain interest into it, I knew it marked the end of it. It's becoming no different than US Dollar, just less liquid.

So, if I want to buy 10 BTC (like I used to), I will have to lose my sleep as during those 4 business days, the rate can drop by hundreds of dollars without me having the option to sell. Thanks, but no thanks! If they allowed me to sell while I'm waiting, okay, but no, they don't. It's not about patience, but insurance. Instant Buy you can sell immediately and limit your loss.

What's funny is that I was a CTO of a startup that did comments search - we had Digg back then, Reddit, and most of the popular blogs and forums with the ability to add your own blog. This was back in 2008, but we didn't succeed due to lack of funding. :)
@_date: 2014-02-14 06:40:44
This isn't breaking news as they didn't say anything new ("we will fix it"). Also, read comments after Mark's - there's some other issue with this implementation. Anyway, I can't imagine who in their right mind would be sending bitcoins to Mt.Gox at this moment! Saying that they need to put the site under maintenance because people are sending bitcoins their way is probably the biggest joke I've read recently!

I think so, too, but he was talking about "worst" case scenario, which was a PR move to tell us they are not making anything from the sale, i.e. prices can't get any lower. For example, they have a 5% rewards programs and so on, so, yeah, in worst case scenario, they might be making 1-2% and on certain items, but that's not what they make on average. Many merchants sell on loss at times. Should they advertise that they are, in fact, losing from commerce? My point is that when you make statements thinking people are idiots, you're not doing yourself a favor! It's tough to implement Bitcoin payments without the help of BitPay and Coinbase, which do a great job, but also keep in mind that this is against the decentralization promise of Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:21:36

Let's be honest here: the points of the Bitcoin supporters were also exaggerated and dishonest.

Agreed, but after all these years of fraud, people still cannot secure their accounts, still are subject to social engineering, and so on. Just yesterday there was a round of scam emails from Blockchain.info and many fell into them. My point is that the money get into Bitcoin, the more attractive it will become for scammers as it's much easier to steal bitcoins than dollars!

Yeah, their maker-taker scheme, but I just wonder why Chinese exchanges work for free pretty much and exchanges like Mt.Gox and Bitstamp work with pretty high fee. BTC-e is relatively cheap, but cheap is still infinitely more expensive than free! Even with their bonus, it sees Chinese traders already moved to Huobi.
@_date: 2014-01-11 22:54:46
True, every % matters, but when you have to spend all your profit on extra labor and face regulatory problems, I don't think it's worth it. I think the future will create a slightly different platform than BitPay and Coinbase that will offer a lot more flexibility and will not hurt Bitcoin price due to the constant flow of sale orders. I really am super excited to see what Circle will come up with. Those guys really need to offer something totally different and I think they will.

Do you know who the worst investors are? Those who get emotionally attached to their investments. If you put money and time into something, like it or not, you're an investor. So, get out of the shoes of a emotionally attached to Bitcoin maniac, and tell me who in their right mind will put hard-earned cash into something that was worth $10 one year ago and that is down 50% of its peak two months ago?
@_date: 2014-01-17 16:53:30
Well, bad or not, it's the highest on the market. Oh, plus $0.15 each way for the ACH. What's funny is that all Bitcoins say banks are crooks, yet, banks charge flat fees or at least a percentage with a cap, yet, all Bitcoin exchanges and businesses charge a percentages. For example, there are free stock trading sites or sites that charge you a single-digit dollar fee - you can't find anything such exchange for Bitcoin! At the end, it costs them the same thing to execute a trade of one satoshi or 10,000 bitcoins!

My claims have the same merits as the claims that this will go on till $5K, $10K, $40K, $1M! Bitcoin ran out of steam when BofA/Merrill Lynch published some positive research showing top value of $1.3K. If you remember, it failed to stay above $1.2K even before China's crackdown. Pretty much volumes dried out (by the way, exchanges have pretty low volumes last week as well) and when there's no steam, it starts to fall. It recovered a bit from the beginning-for-the-new-yer optimism, but there's so much it can do without the general audience buying into it and it's not buying and is actually getting bored by the now standard dispensing of at least an article a day about Bitcoin by any mainstream media outlet.

You ignore the fact that they possibly lost coins from the TM. It's so easy to empty out their physical coins! Basically, you double up you coins on each transaction, and powers of 2 grow pretty rapidly! With just 10 BTC, after just 10 withdrawals it's 10,240 BTC!

It's just empty words. I hope they don't have bitcoins stolen as they haven't brought this up at all. It's all very bubbly - if they have bitcoins really stolen, they need fresh new idiots to put money into the exchange so that those who withdraw won't reveal their insolvency.

I never said prices will always go up - does USD/EUR always go up, no - neither does gold, but until demand is higher than supply, there's no other option with a limited supply and demand being higher than mining yield. In fact, Bitcoin price is not going down, because demand subsides - it's because speculators want to make more Bitcoins, but eventually they still want the price to go up so that they can have a positive fiat balance. I think precious metals and minerals are a lot more volatile in long term than Bitcoin as resources in the universe are pretty much unlimited. In just a few years, asteroid mining may flood the market with unlimited amounts of gold and diamonds (Deep Space Industries and Planetary Resources are already working on this), which is not the case with Bitcoin with fundamentally limited supply.

BTC China only exists as it was convenient for people in China. Remove this convenience, there's no need for BTC China (and OKCoin and the many others in China). Looking into the drop of trade volumes, obviously, vouchers aren't the way to work around the issue. Look also at HuoBi's volume - their owner is playing with fire now and the volume is nearly 10 times that of the BTC China now, so, obviously convenience is very important. I don't see myself using LocalBitcoins.com and many are like me - I want to be able to buy and sell from my computer with no fear that the government can one day decide to go after me, seize my coins at an exchange, etc. When pretty much all financial experts are saying this is a bubble, governments have no choice, but to try to prevent the bubble, and more and more governments will take measures against cryptos. I'm not sure why after India's warning, people didn't react already - everybody was spreading hopes that India will compensate for China, but it doesn't seem to be the case. Also, look at the Chinese exchange's total volume - it's still times higher than everything else together!

The market did not crash. Somebody sold 1,000 BTC and the order book was not prepared to handle it. Then it triggered panic sells, but it has almost recovered since then. We've seen a drop pretty much every weekend when (rich) players rest and until fresh fiat comes in on Monday.

I'd rather be greedy than envious. What's the best outcome of envy? - Cancer. The best outcome of greed - Getting rich.
I'm tired of people comparing Bitcoin to tulips and other things from the past. As an online merchant, I love Bitcoin - no chargebacks, low fees, I can accept payments from the entire universe and I don't have to collect billing info from customer I don't really care about. Do you know how much time is wasted with people who put the wrong CVV code or have a billing address that doesn't match their current residence? Bitcoin solves all these problems so elegantly. It is a very useful tool - unlike tulip bulbs. Yes, every scheme has a nice story, but when you hear credible people like Peter Thiel and Bill Gates and big businesses adopting it, then all doubts don't last long. Most people who talk crap about Bitcoin are envious they didn't buy when it was cheaper and subconsciously hope by talking crap to drag the price down and buy cheaper, which isn't gonna happen.

Same issue I've got (although worked via SMS). Also, they screwed up a few small purchases and transfers for me - obviously their software is way too buggy. I'm not sure how anybody can trust them with their money?! Not to mention than they gave me a price, I submitted, then in transaction history I saw $20+ higher cost, which is a huge percentage on top of their already huge 1% (total 2% if you buy and sell).
