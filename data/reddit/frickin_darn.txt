Pivoting between 20% up and 20% down

Actually it is! And no pesky commissions

There are many levels of “poor”. Everyone agrees that the poorest get help. But there is a middle ground where the poor don’t qualify for assistance, can’t pay for insurance, and they slip through the cracks and go bankrupt.

I think you’re going to see a deal when it actually starts trading again
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:07:24
I think round numbers people pile on because it’s a psychological level. As for whales, who are they and what are their intentions? Who knows, use it to your advantage if you can.

I doubt this guy will sleep tonight

You must be new.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:33:03
I think you see traders taking opportunity
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:08:47
It may be, but I think the overall supply and demand of price movement wins out eventually. Its a double edged sword, no SEC oversight, more of a wild west atmosphere. Can't have it both ways.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:19:32
The amount of anxiety around here when the price drops is through the roof
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:26:12
Can I offer you this lovely bond portfolio?

The fact that the saying “to the moon!” became prevalent years ago, it has changed from its intended purpose into a trading product
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:13:01
Judging by previous posts, this is a problem since this past spring
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:19:25
Futures can be scary though. They settle at the end of each day, meaning you realize your gains or losses from your account. Also a minimum contract is 5 BTC, minimum price fluctuation is 25 dollars per contract ‘tick’. If people were having a cow with BTC moving against them right now, they’d be jumping out of windows with futures.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:17:40
Look at the monthly chart of BTC and tell me with a straight face now is a good time to get in.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:00:15
I'm not having a problem but the cut off charts suck.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:45:21
I think you'll see a lot of that if it has a huge pullback. I think its human nature.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:48:42

The rich will always dig their fingers into everything, that’s how they got rich in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:11:12
Are you talking about charts?
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:55:55
Yeah I think you're right, demand will outweigh supply, but I still think anything is susceptible to pullbacks either on emotion or technicals.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:14:56
I would argue that it’s needed big time. Although the collective anxiety attack here would be off the charts
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:14:01
It’s interesting, would have thought futures open interest would have been much higher. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:35:04
I agree, I saw his other posts
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:52:28
If they were so manipulative, why did they halt it. That sell wall came up after they halted.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:07:16
You’ll be fine
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:00:41
It’s gonna be insane when it starts trading again

That’s a bold move Cotton...

How do you like tradingview over all?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:37:27
Funny how people run for the government. Be careful what you wish for, the government could destroy bitcoin in a day.

People get emotional with large sums of money and volatility. But it’s also the same reason we have huge swings in price. Double edged sword. I think it’s a traders paradise!
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:54:16
I love how a drop automatically means something sinister is happening. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:33:59
You could call it The Cryminal! Jokes.

Looks like tradingview.com. Also, Google “technical analysis of chart basics”
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:15:24
This sub is not far off from any other pump forum you see for a penny stock.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:41:03
Looks to me that a bunch of buy orders sitting there knowing what could happen, and they were right....
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:01:19
Each exchange probably has different prices to some extent. It can be to your advantage too...
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:15:19
If I was going to sell a huge position to make my shorts pop, I'd do it on a Monday morning when CNBC was on the air and people were paying more attention

If people around here keep crying for the SEC it could happen here too
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:29:28
Look at the exchange order book. If anything BCH will be a fraction of what it opened at. That doesn’t seem like GDAX working in their own favor. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:59:30
Interesting how people get worried and cry for their regulators

Don’t panic. You can only lose if you sell. Don’t sell it.

I feel like they could get better prices by spreading the block out, play it cool instead of just plopping it out there.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:49:26
If you look at a long enough timeline a smart person wouldn't get in until a major pull back. Not these little 5% things that quickly resolve. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:09:33
Just because CNBC is wrong or has no idea what’s its talking about doesn’t equal fake news. Sure they’re sensational, but they can actually help bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:42:00
Arbitrage opportunity

Not sure I can see that on GDAX.

People may see that, but do they care? I traded during the dot com era, and you could literally throw money at any ticker symbol on NASDAQ and make money. I say, make money, that’s why we’re here, and don’t try to catch a falling knife.

Corrections are good and natural for sustainable growth. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:56:18
That tough, but good job being there in person, and getting to talk to at least someone and have them listen.
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:48:12
You don’t make it until you sell!
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:58:12
People could take profits in a rush, but honestly this ride isn’t gonna be over for a long time. If it tanked to 3 bucks, people would be right there to scoop it up. I think some major outside influence would be needed to really burst this bubble and I don’t see that being a predictable thing.
