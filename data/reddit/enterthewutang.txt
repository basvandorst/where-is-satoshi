I honestly don’t understand how this happens to people... how hard is it to just copy and paste your address? I don’t get where people have the room to make a mistake

Don't believe their lies

This actually makes some semblance of sense though - they see BCH as a direct competitor to bitcoin so they have an economic incentive to hate bitcoin. But people on r/buttcoin are mostly nocoiners

I'd honestly be happy to see us range between 7.4k-13k for another 6 months. More time to accumulate. Shake out weak hands. Charge up for the real bull run to begin

That's just, like, your opinion man. They said the same thing about the internet, the automobile and electricity


If btc holders didn't sell through an 80% drop do you really think a little recession will change that?

This isn't really a sub for trading mate. The vast, vast majority of people here dollar cost average and hold - a strategy which has yielded results far more effective than the vast, vast majority of traders' results.

Yeah idk what everyone is stressing about tbh. Bring on 8.8k, 8k, 7.4k. I'll buy all that shit

You're right actually, I'm dumb. 
But it did also happen after a parabolic 100X move in just over two years. New buyers were completely outstripped.


Why do you think people buy bitcoin? I would wager a good amount do it not because they expect the value to go up as much as they expect the value of fiat currencies to nosedive during the incoming recession. Interest rates are going back to 0 and QE is coming back in a big way in most major developed economies. I honestly feel far more comfortable holding bitcoin than I do holding dollars.

Do you know how the index is measured at all? It seems kinda arbitrary to me..
