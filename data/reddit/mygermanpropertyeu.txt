I had a few people test it and the auction worked fine. We also have an ebay auction running  if you cant find a facebook one, and we have a threat on the bitcoin talk forums

Are you saying the auction did not work for you when you went to enter it?

I think I will try.....where is the most popular forums these days for it?

Its nice to see germany are making an effort. Especially as we are trying to auction properties here for bitcoin, it will give a good framework to our auctions!

maybe the only reason 'scam' ads run is because people who genuinely want to deal with bit-coins for their business get spat on and frowned at by the bitcoin community until they basically give up. I tried to sell a house last year for a client in bitcoin on the bitcoin talk forum- the moment I listed it had 'scammmm!' screaming from the rafters. So I just sold it on ebay to someone instead. Then the Bitcoins skyrocketed- So I thought why not try again. I was 'lolled' out of the forum being told that mow bitcoins were far to valuable for the likes of property purchases.......so the bitcoins took a massive crash, I decided to give it a final push and accept bitcoin on my property purchases one last time, and there isn't even a hint of interest in the forums whatsoever. Did the bitcoin community kill itself with it's Arty zim level of smugness or something? From the outside looking in, it seems bitcoin is like that mythical girl who is so smoking hot, that she never thinks any guy is good enough until one day she is old ugly and realises she is going to die alone.....if you guys won't allow businesses to come into your community and start trying to actually deal with your currency for real world items then the only thing bitcoin is going to attract is scam artists. Sorry if I get a load of Neg relies on this but thats how it seems, and I'm waiting to be proved wrong.

if you have no facebook have a look at the thread on bitcoin talk

I've listed a property on the bitcoin talk forum but have no one biting- whats going on?

I'd disagree a bit with your statement. Yes trust is important. And in the offline world this is done with things like calling a lawyer, checking a property etc. In the Bitcoin community I was finding stranger comments, like how do we know the house exists, which can easily be checked with a lawyer in Germany, and how do we know you own a property and are not just faking it. Then when suggestions of calling the lawyer were made, it was apparently difficult for too many people to grasp. I do appreciate though that a lot of people in the BC market are young and only used to buying things on the internet like an xbox or drugs, which would have to be posted, wheras a property deal is logically, easy to check on with deeds and registration......
