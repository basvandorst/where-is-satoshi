They get into that in the whitepaper, explicitly discussing why they felt like they need a new coin. I recommend checking it out.

It's fully programmable - any contract you can think of can be implemented in the language, allowing it to be used for any sort of digital contract.

Your critique seems to be, "Nobody has explicitly asked for this functionality so it's not needed". Under that logic, Bitcoin would never have been developed.

To clarify - inopia here is talking about Bitcoin in particular, but not blockchain-based approaches in general. [The list of hard problems for cryptocurrencies here is a good read for anyone interested in the subject.](

I'm not quite sure if Etherium can be called an altcoin, given its intended purpose. It's not doing the same thing as Bitcoin, even if it's using a similar mechanism to achieve its goals.


Which is explicitly why they're creating a new coin - the odds of Bitcoin ramming through the necessary changes are extremely small, for what they note are valid concerns about the point of the changes. Bitcoin doesn't need what Ethereum has, which is why Ethereum is being created.
