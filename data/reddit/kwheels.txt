Can someone explain why I am able to do segwit transactions for ~$10usd fee, and 10 min for first confirmation out of my hardware wallet, to places that don't support segwit(ie exchanges), but still have the benefits? 
I understand segwit is a soft fork, I'm just missing the part about how the two play nice/I can get the benefit  in one direction but not the other.

Leave Trevor out of this, he's just an innocent bystander!  
In all seriousness though, you can use a trezor or ledger in conjunction with Electrum or Mycleium for a mobile payment experience with the extra security of a hardware wallet...

Is there literally any crypto company with positive reviews on trust pilot? Or any positively reviewed companies at all? It seems like people only go here when they are upset, and more so, seems like they go here instead of support, to complain about their issue, instead of getting it resolved

I don't understand why this is an issue..if you sell on robinhood and buy back in asap, you should have roughly the same amount as you did on robinhood.
@_date: 2019-07-23 12:18:23
The only reason it would be smaller is:  
a) exchange rates are different  
b) price changes while you wait for funds to move to bank then to exchange  
c) transaction fee's  
Lets use easy numbers... lets say you bought 100,000 satoshi at $10  
The price of bitcoin goes up 20%, you now have 12 in value, and the same 100,000 satoshi  
If you sell at 12 on robinhood, and are able to buy back in reasonably quickly from an exchange, you will get the current value of $12 in BTC, which should be the same 100,000 satoshi's, minus fee's, and the exchange rate will likely be a bit different. Overall, you should have roughly the same amount of BTC on either platform.  
(note, these numbers are not real, and do not reflect actual exchange rates, just trying to simplify this)

Abra is an interesting wallet. It looks like they allow you to 'buy' other cryptos, but you actually just hold a fluctuating amount of BTC based on the other crypto's price. Not a big fan of their off-chain setup, but I can see that it serves a purpose, and it does seem to be user friendly. 
Its always good for more people to have the ability to buy BTC via their bank account, all around the world.

You need to do more research on Bitcoin... from everything you have said here, the wallet is working as intended, you just dont understand how bitcoin works.   
its very clear from reading these posts that you have unconfirmed funds...most wallets will not allow you to send unconfirmed funds  
Check the transaction that you 'sent 100 to a friend' and once it has 6 confirmations, your funds will be available to spend in the wallet. you need to wait for the 'change' to confirm.  
You can also enable 'spend unconfirmed funds' in the advanced options, but it wont actually broadcast until the funds confirmed...it will essentailly queue up the transaction  
the wallet address changing is working as intended to obscure your identity, old addresses dont expire, and funds sent to those addresses will still be credited to your wallet

As an american... I carry one of the 10T notes in my wallet to remind me that hyper inflation is a real thing and happening every day around the world.  
EDIT: and on that note...how tf do you guys carry these notes... in less than 2 years in my wallet the bill has been absolutely destroyed and torn up. Its clearly not made of the same type of cotton/linen/paper us bank notes are... just curious if theres a special way i'm supposed to tread these, or if they are literally just so cheaply made that carrying them in a wallet will destroy them
@_date: 2019-03-26 17:51:43
Yes, i understand. I understood it from your very first post. 
When you receive 500 that creates 1 input
When you spend 100, you actually send all 500, and the 400 remainder comes back to you as 'change'
Look at the transaction on a blockchain explorer, and you will see this transaction. 1 input will create 2 outputs, one to pay the 100, and another to return the 400 to your wallet
You must wait for that 'change' to confirm (in the same transaction you sent 100) before it is available for you to spend again.
You cant send a partial input. When you have 1 input, you send the entirety of that amount, and receive the remainder back as change. Think of bitcoin like dollar bills rather than your bank account... you have a $100 bill, and need to buy something for 20, you dont tear 1/5 off the bill and pay with that, you pay with the $100 bill, and receive $80 as change.
as opposed to an account style, you have 100 in your account, and spend 20, which leaves you 80 in the account... bitcoin doesn't work like this, its not account based. Eth is, but not bitcoin.

The exchange rates to stable coins are awful.. I was trying to get just $10 in stable coins and the best rate I could find was 20% over market rate. I'm sure the low amount I was trying to get was part of my issue, but i was very dissapointed to see the massive markups on rates for stable coins.

As the BitPay wallet is a true Bitcoin wallet, the keys are only stored on your device. Try and password you may have set this to in the past, as it would be difficult to accidentally set a password.   
Your only other option is to use the 12 word recovery phrase to restore that wallet...I would restore it to another device to make sure it works before deleting the locked wallet on your original device. 
@_date: 2019-08-08 12:27:08
BitPay uses on-chain transactions, so it takes however long the network takes to confirm the transaction.  
If you use a wallet with payment protocol, it will require a fee to be paid for a speedy confirmation (generally within the next block or two), but if you bypass that requirement, and use a lower fee, it may take much longer
@_date: 2019-08-13 11:56:08
That may be true, but it's not fair to say they scammed you. Misinformation like this pushes more people away from crypto than it helps.

You can always install nicehash on all of them and let them run, all tied back to your account. It won't make much, but depending on the specs of the computer they will likely make a few sats a day each. you won't actually be mining BTC (probably monero on the cpu, and eth or other coins on the GPU if it has a dedicated gpu), but the pay will be in BTC. My 1080 gaming rig makes about 2500 sat/ 18 cents a day on nicehash for reference.

Wallets have multiple addresses. Addresses don't 'expire' per say, but some wallets try not to reuse addresses to protect your privacy. Old addresses still work, and funds sent to old addresses should still appear in your wallet

Yes. you can use a limit order to buy/sell at a specified price. Buy price must be lower than current price, sell price must be higher than current price (can be .01 cent higher though)
Edit: maybe not automated like you think. you can use gdax to buy in the dips and sell at high points, but you cant set a weekly transfer or similar.

If the price goes up, its not inconceivable that your bitcoin will be worth 22 cents more.... though this is entirely dependent on how much bitcoin you have. If you only have a dollar, its not likely that it will go up 22% in the near future... but if the purchase is larger, then the % gain it has to go up to make you 22 cents is substantially smaller

You should reach out to their support. They have tools that can look a bit deeper into the issue. Sounds to me like what the above commenter said, that you are just waiting on change to confirm back into your wallet, as a part of the bitcoin protocol, not something bitpay is doing

I get about 10% of my pay in crypto... enough that it wont ever impact my ability to pay bills.   
If i were getting 50%, i'd either do what is said below, and sell the 50, keep the 15% as a 'bonus' or get something like the BitPay card so you have the option to pay your normal expenses with it. I know the BitPay card has been controversial around here, but it's worked fine for me, and as long as you live in the US, and can pass their KYC, it seems to be a great option to be able to use your crypto for normal every day purchases and bills.

3 of those look to be similar or identical to 'bitcoin bullion' sold on jmbullion or apmex.   
The copper ones are worth about $2 each in copper, however I bought a bunch of them and sold them for $6-7 each and had no problem finding people who were into bitcoin who would pay that for them.  
The silver ones are likely an ounce of silver each, so they are worth at least spot price on silver.
The gold one is not likely real gold, but still may be worth more than the silver one, depending on what metal is underneath. I can't find the gold looking ones for sale anywhere, so i've got no guesses on that one
@_date: 2019-01-18 20:22:45
At the risk of getting banned here..then buy BCH or a different currency.  
If your friend will only accept bitcoin, it sounds like it doesn't matter how long it takes to sync... you dont really have an option.  
There are also other wallets that sync quicker than Electrum... wallets like Copay/BitPay use a server to 'index' transactions so the wallet itself doesn't have to sync. The downside is, you need internet to use the wallets
@_date: 2019-01-18 20:04:11
You need to buy crypto....  
The easiest way will be to make an account on an exchange (coinbase is one of the bigger exchanges in the US, i recommend sticking to bigger well known exchanges), verify your identity, link a bank account or credit card, and buy crypto. Then you can transfer to your wallet, or directly to his wallet  
I heard coinstar is rolling out buying bitcoin, so if you have a big enough piggy bank, you may be able to use one of those  
Local bitcoins would be another potential option  
  
You could ask your friend if he will sell you 50 of BTC for cash... i know quite a few people who have crypto, and would sell small amounts to a friend.
@_date: 2019-01-22 16:25:12

Why? The app is not a fraud, you just disagree with the philosophy of its creator. Reporting apps for false reasons hurts the entire ecosystem, and makes the major app stores hesitate more to allow any apps regarding crypto.

@_date: 2019-01-10 20:31:01
Sounds like an easy mistake to make, but fortunately there is an easy fix.
You will need your 12 word recovery phrase for the BCH wallet.
If you dont have it, go in the app, click the BCH wallet, and in the settings, there should be a backup option.
Once you have those 12 words, create a new BTC wallet, but under advanced options select 'specify recovery phrase' and use the 12 words from your BCH wallet.
Once thats set up, if the funds don't immediately show up, you may have to go in the settings, and look for some settings about 'clearing cache' and 'scanning addresses' (these will be under settings &gt; more options &gt; Wallet addresses and Transaction history)
Once you run both of those, your funds should show up.
@_date: 2019-01-11 13:12:12
I understand where you're coming from, but anyone who is 'fooled' by this should be reading more closely while dealing with their crypto.
It very clearly labels bitcoin cash... "Bitcoin Cash (BCH)" and also supports Bitcoin BTC. It doesn't do anything to 'hide' BTC as some people claim.... the only thing I could say that MIGHT be misleading, is that it defaults to creating a BCH wallet rather than a BTC wallet.

Don't forget about the inventor of multi-sig, Copay, and its sister app BitPay.   
Multi-sig is an incredible security feature, but its always advisable to take some extra steps to guarantee accessibility to your funds if something goes wrong.  
Like all Bitcoin wallets, it's important to properly back up your seed phrases. I also recommend always using one more device than required, for example, make a 2-3 wallet instead of a 2-2... this way if one device is lost or broken, you still have a backup device in order to transfer the funds to a new wallet
