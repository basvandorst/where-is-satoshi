If BTC were meant to be a currency and move away from banks then even a $10 fee will not work
I have zero fee banking, my pay goes in and I never worry about it
Once I month I settle a credit card bill for whatever I can pay via card since I get rewards for no fees as well
I do like 30-60 transactions a month, no way I would be able to leave FIAT

Is that high?
It's less than $2,500/person
or if you exclude kids etc like max $4,000/person
Just asking

Segwit is good, but it won't fix the tx fee problem by itself
A block increase would, or a block increase plus segwit &lt;2 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:06:45
So it would be a negligible difference
But if you are processing transactions you would actually lose money since the tx fee is lower, that seems to be the real motivation to stick to 1MB :)

I mean one company produces the majority of miners as it is and the next two companies are also based in China
Plus China does 2/3's of all mining
How decentralized are we?

If the block size is 2MB, would you be unable to operate a node?

also buying BTC via coinbase :o

I was like, damn Dave is funny and he knows about BTC?

Segwit is already being implemented
LN is not ready, plus it's if the blockchain anyway 
The 1MB block size needs to increase

For purposes of the gif, we will assume each coin represents 1 Satoshi  :)

They're not afraid of people in my area, came home to one napping in my carport and tried to scare him off
He walked up to me and cupped his hands together waiting for a treat
Little rascals

They did an interview with Sophia Loren and she said she was afraid on off them might pop out, lol

Other places are open
QuadrigaCX has been good for Canada

We already have a big scam every other week where an exchange shuts down or coins are lost
The crypto scene is a shitshow and that's how some people want it :(

Yea, the adoption, and development is accelerated
If we look at BTC where it only allows single transactions at a time
To ETH - smart contracts and tokes
To Monero - Anonymous transactions
To Nano - Free Instant transactions
and all the new third-gen cryptos which can fetch data from different blockchains and usually have no mining/community nodes etc.
It's like night and day inside 10 years
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:19:08
Just an example
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:06:22
For sure we haven't even really begun to understand what it is the blockchain will be
It's like we're laying down the copper lines for telephone and trying to imagine where it will lead.
You don't see people sending selfies around the world from a telephone demonstration a hundred years earlier

Definetly more accurate
Otherwise **Community Mascot** or something would work
