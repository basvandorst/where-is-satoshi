After studying the charts if, if it goes anything like my erection after seeing your handle, I'll be a happy guy!
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:52:39
Yeah I get it I guess, What would be the go to wallet for you other than paper? Have mycelium, but so many mixed reviews who knows man...
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:42:56
Bitches man, Yeah, I'm deff holding my coins now. Lessons from kanye, learn I must....
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:58:29
If it crashes, no doubt I will be blaming you all in this post for recklessly influencing to make this stupid decision...
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:20:50
I hope it tanks, it's likely I'll buy more cause I'm an idiot
@_date: 2017-08-07 02:39:27
so if I had bitcoins myself that I wanted to sell p2p, would that be risky for me in anyway, like getting screwed, or legal complications?
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:40:24
If you go south enough it will be north right?? Oh never mind almost forgot the earth was flat...
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:22:39
Personal loan is not 5, I'm gonna hold the btc for over 5 years at least, prob longer
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:55:29
Couldn't help myself and took out a 20k loan. Feels good man
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:44:00
No doubt, I stranger from time to time though
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:09:43
I've been following cryptocurrecy for a whole year and now I want to buy my first bitcoin, but with all fork stuff has got me on edge, but I'd love to participate... looking at the trends, bitcoin is gonna be big one day, it's not if, but when, just gotta be in the long haul and just buy, and never sell lol, just more buying... so how do I subscribe to your email?
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:34:30
Yeah I ended up checking it out, it's nice brother. I found the info on there was very helpful, and fairly unbiased, and smart too, which I think is good man. Keep it up. I subscribed and looking forward to your updates!
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:33:28
Told you all! I out a post up awhile ago around spring about Me getting a personal loan to buy 1 bitcoin, and got totally rekt! By almost everyone trashing me about how stupid that would be ... but now I'm that guy in that gif... boom.
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:24:44
Yeah seems like it, very weird
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:32:33
Closed and opened multiple times... Nothing has changed. Does this mean my wallet may have been comprised or hacked in some way?
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:35:08
Lol, wow looking back at this post makes me cringe at my nooby-ness, and the way I asked that question is pure faggotry, I just slap myself for this post. But oh yes it paid off, and so is my loan, and now I have about 2800. Yay.
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:39:18
No I don't think so, it says it happened a month ago. 
Anyways, here's the TX Id I think... 
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:41:05
No, never. It just say +5 btc added from maybe an accident of someone's? But also no transactions of it leaving which I though was weird...
