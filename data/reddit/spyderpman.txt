At least they're willing to get up and *do* something about their opinion. It may not help that much, but it's more than boycotting only with your wallet. Even if they only are able to influence one person, they will have succeeded in what they want.
It may look bad, but big props to them for actual going out and doing something. (Again even though this isn't some important issue, and i may not necessarily agree with them, they still did it).

Reddit in general is a place where vengeance is one of the best actions, and as you can see amplifies that feeling. Its awful.
I think people need to double down and target Newsweek over Leah herself, yes she did a terrible thing and should be ashamed, but the reaction is too extreme for anyone.

Yeah I could watch any video on Stephen Molyneuxs channel. I wonder what happened?

You forgot to say "This is HUGE"
But seriously, this is great news!

Who would be reordering the inputs and how? And with transactions are you supposed to be able to know what "Id" your transaction should have? 
Is the claim MtGox making something along the lines that there are fake "id's" being made that don't actually correspond to the transactions? Or am I way off?
Also, would you accept a dogecoin tip? I have more bitcoin, but I never setup with that tipbot. And I really appreciate the explanation!

I think I got it. This is awesome, thanks!

I mean... I guess confidence can be a good thing.

I know, I'm just playing with ya

Of course! How else will you be successful in life!?

That's crazy, I literally got an invite 2 days ago with the free $10 lol

Isn't that place just a parody? Like SRS originally meant to call out stupid stuff, but Buttcoin just seems to be more of a circlejerk/parody with most of it's posts seeming like jokes.

I know plenty of guys who have been making bank with the free power for about a year and a half now.

So what is the Transaction Malleability? What are the *actual* problems it creates, I realize this 'hacking' and 'theft' are nonsense, but I want to know what the malleability will do.

Then a tip of my hat will have to do. Thank you so much this entire thread is super helpful. I've been mining since I've gotten my new computer and I've been really interested in the financial side of it (it's essentially my version of the stock market), but I haven't been able to much explain/understand the technical side. 
This gives me a great start! And people say the bitcoin community isn't welcoming.
@_date: 2014-05-09 04:54:33
HOLY SHIT THIS THREAD

I'm super excited for Circle, I hope I can get an invite soon (though I understand if I don't) I can't wait to see where they go with this!
Though, I kinda don't like that they prioritize dollars over btc. I mean, have the info there so you can start knowing the conversion, but I entirely think bitcoin should strive to have its own value.

lol I stop by to see if there was progress only to see [this](

You should look into how Reddit does its voting, thru fuzz votes a lot do you can't actually see the vote gain/loss. Hell the number shown of votes is just the least common denominator of your actual vote count. Karma is dumb just ignore it :p
