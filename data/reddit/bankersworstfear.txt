Screw banks; lets use bitcoin!
Chase bank is implementing capital controls. Making it harder for people to buy bitcoin with LocalBitcoins.com via bank deposits at chase. guess other banks will take their business!
@_date: 2014-05-20 19:52:52
maybe it would slow it down though
@_date: 2014-02-14 20:53:22
awesome. had to tweet it
@_date: 2014-01-11 19:32:44
"If the wrong guy is discouraged from using bitcoin it might be catastrophical.", now you mean it could greatly slow the adoption of bitcoin.

The amount of services you receive from bitcoin (free software) will far outpace what the banking system can do. I mean it already does. You can't send funds worldwide without massive Western Union fees for many locations.
The cost of the huge banking bureaucracy is calculated into what they can provide you in services.

What price do you see a scenario of your fellow bitcoiners selling the majority of their holding for?
$2,000? $5,000? $100,000 ?
what worth is it to control the lot of bitcoin if the users go away.

All-party consent states[edit]
Twelve states currently require that all parties consent to the recording: California,[20] Connecticut,[21] Florida,[22] Hawaii (in general a one-party state, but requires two-party consent if the recording device is installed in a private place),[21] Illinois (debated, see next section), Maryland,[23] Massachusetts,[21] Montana[24] (requires notification only), Nevada,[21] New Hampshire,[25] Pennsylvania,[26] and Washington.[27] However, three of the above states that permission is given if any of the parties announces that they will be recording the call in a reasonable manner if the recording contains that announcement.
One-party consent states[edit]
All other states (and the District of Columbia) not listed above require only that one party consent.
Illinois courts have ruled that "eavesdropping" only applies to conversations that the party otherwise would not have been able to hear, thereby effectively making it a one-party consent state.[28][29] However, there still appears to be confusion[30] and debate[31] over the law.
Michigan courts have ruled that eavesdropping only applies to: "a third party not otherwise involved in the conversation being eavesdropped on." This is because the law uses the wording, "the private discourse of others", rather than the wording, "the private discourse of others or with others".[32] Michigan law is often misinterpreted as requiring the consent of all parties to a conversation.[33]
The California Supreme Court has ruled that if a caller in a one-party state records a conversation with someone in California, that one-party state caller is subject to the stricter of the laws and must have consent from all callers (Cf. Kearney v. Salomon Smith Barney Inc., 39 Cal. 4th 95 (2006)[34]).

Its a method of more organized society, less waste and less confusion.
The difficulties argument is something you should know not to hold on to because bitcoin was (and is) difficult to use for the average person. But as it picks up userbase, the path to user friendliness is exponential.

It is legit. We have spoke with the CEO, he has done multiple interviews, had his team show up at multiple expos/conferences. They're real.
Had a contract that pays, etc.
There are many benefits to everyone for them running the operation instead of people just buying bitcoin.
1. Gain investment to build mining farm from individual users interested in mining instead of looking for large sums from investors (harder probably)
2. Said mining farm increases the security of bitcoin
3. Has a company with influence in bitcoin
4. Provide a mining services for excite value. In some cases you'll be more profitable than buying coins, in other cases you wont. It depends on how fast the difficulty increases vs how fast the price increases

Actually, more bitcoin units are made per month (10,800) than dollar units (8,500), but not much different.
Bitcoin unit is a satoshi, the smallest unit at the 8th decimal place

bad/incomplete theory.
1. Miners get paid transaction fees; these should increase in quantity as bitcoin economy grows
2. Hardware is getting more efficient and cheaper just like any computer technology does
