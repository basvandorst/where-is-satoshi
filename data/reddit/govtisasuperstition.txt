This is a misunderstanding of ancap philosophy. Defaulting on a debt is not aggressive. We won't use violence against you for doing that. It is dishonest to sign an agreement and accept a loan that you don't intend to repay. In an ancap society, the person loaning you money won't be able to force you to work as a slave to repay it. And they won't be able to cage you for not repaying. But being deceitful will damage your reputation in society. The rest of society doesn't have any obligation to continue to loan you money or provide you with their products/services.
In the case of defaulting on a mortgage, the property owner has every right to use force to remove you from his/her property if you back out on your agreement. Obviously the anti-capitalist would disagree with the idea of private property.

Seems like lots of the people commenting didn't read the OP. The OP is asking why the fed and their buddies can't control the price of bitcoin like they do gold. The real answer is that they can't control the price of gold. The central banks do own a lot of gold, so they have a large influence over the price, but they cannot fully control it.

Sure, but the governments of the world will place a huge burden on this gateway ecosystem. Paypal, SEPA, Alipay, VISA etc will all have to follow government laws for moving money around, even when using bitcoin. You won't need govt permission to connect to the bitcoin network, but you will need it to connect to the fiat money network. With that, you will have the inevitable consequences: Privacy will be dead, seizures of funds will occur, whitelists/blacklists, etc. Moving bitcoin without using an approved gateway will likely be illegal. Just look at the proposed Lawsky regulations for evidence of this.
The bitcoin network will have to be built separate from the fiat network, with only minor links such as exchanges connecting the two. All of the innovation will happen within the bitcoin network. This innovation will make it easier to send and store bitcoin. Govt regulation will stifle all the innovation that could take place with gateways. It's unfortunate, as the gateways would make it easier for people to use and trust the bitcoin network, like the author explains.
Good read though. We will see this gateway ecosystem sprout up in countries whose govts are friendly to bitcoin. But I don't think there will be many.

Yes, this is a good question and helps to get at the root of the issue. Most people would say that real money is issued by govt. They don't understand that money originates in the free market. They have a misunderstanding of the history and function of money. Because the govt has monopolized the money for so long, they can't comprehend a world of competing currencies in a market. They don't really understand why gold was used as money. Because of this lack of knowledge, they don't understand bitcoin. Working around that, as OP did, can only do so much.
I agree with most of what you wrote on that link. I especially liked this statement: "Or for that matter an alchemist could have engineered a denser metal, gold, to be used as money in a world where only copper existed, and it would be adopted because it is better money (better properties)."

I don't understand cryptography or computer science. Those aren't necessary to understanding bitcoin. Some knowledge of money is necessary though.

Schools/parents need to better at teaching the concept of money, not of cryptography.

I'll play devil's advocate.
World of Warcraft also has an "excel file" that lists the amount of gold owned by every character. The difference is that in the bitcoin system the excel file is peer-to-peer. That doesn't mean it's real money. It's pretend money.
Understanding money is critical to understanding digital currency.

This conversation necessitates discussion of political philosophy and government, and may not be exactly suitable for this sub. Your topic is similar to the argument that government is responsible for all technological advances throughout history, and that if we got rid of govt, we would go back to hunter-gatherers. 
You are confusing two different concepts. One is political authority/centralization by government. The other is simply cooperation on a massive scale. You can have the second w/o the first. The growth of population, division of labor, use of currency, etc that you describe is simply cooperation on a massive scale. It does not require government, though you may disagree. 
I would argue that fiat currencies are not cooperation on a massive scale, like gold was. It was government authority that centralized the system and created fiat currency. Humanity advances by tearing down politically centralized systems (monarchies, slavery, dictatorships, etc.), and creating systems of cooperation that operate without authority. The internet is one example of that. But if you want to justify fiat money, you really need to justify the idea of political authority, a special moral property that govt has. Govt has authority to print/issue money, while individuals do not. 
It doesn't really matter if you think decentralization is a bad idea. If bitcoin is useful, people will use it, and it will grow. If fiat is better, then people will stick with that.

There are people that put away money for many years in their savings account. Do they do so to store value? Do they plan to eventually spend it? To an outsider, it would look like this person views their savings account like gold, as a store of value, not to be spent on a daily basis. So where's the difference? I would say there is none. 
Money is both a store of value and a medium of exchange. Depending on the environment and the person, the scale can tip toward one or the other. But money will always have both characteristics. Gold was, in the past, a type of money. Diamonds were never money on a large scale. Diamonds don't have the same attributes as gold, and are difficult to use as a medium of exchange, though they may store their value well.
Bitcoin has the attributes to potentially be a commonly-accepted money. Currently, it isn't commonly accepted in transactions. Therefore, it's difficult to "spend" it like a traditional money. It is commonly just exchanged for other monies (USD, Euro, etc.). In this way, it is similar to gold, which like bitcoin, is an uncommon money.
But if it becomes more popular, people will be able to spend it for their daily transactions. Just like if gold returned to its dominance as money, you would be able to spend it for daily transactions (through something similar to an e-gold service, not chipping off flakes to buy groceries).
The problem is you need to fully understand what money is.

You are correct for the most part. The govt control of money favors the well connected at the expense of the average person. And you raise good questions about what will happen if bitcoin eliminates the govt's monopoly on money. Your view on this will depend on how you understand politics and philosophy. Do you view govt as necessary or as evil?
I would argue that governments cannot exist without controlling the money. Political power is based on money power. If they cannot force you to pay taxes, or force upon you a paper currency they can print at will to fund their warfare and welfare, then they have no power.
If bitcoin renders all paper currencies worthless, then governments will disappear. Once you return money to the free market, then all the other govt "services" will also return to the market. This post-govt world is difficult to imagine, hence I like to think of it as an economic singularity. But it will be great, since it will be based on voluntary interaction, not govt theft and coercion.
Don't be scared of a world without central banks and governments.

Some people store gold on their own, and sometimes they use a 3rd party like a bank or vault. Bitcoin banks will compete on trust and service just like banks did back when gold was used as money.

Well, I think virtually everyone will switch over long before their fiat paper goes to zero. Will be obvious to everyone, that the digital currency works, while the paper one doesn't. Prices at the store will keep going down in terms of the digital currency, and up in terms of the fiat paper. Everyone they transact with will prefer the digital currency. Very few people's standard of living will go down. 
Fiat paper has long been eroded. Ask anyone who's saved in any paper for a couple decades. At least this time, it will be a voluntary transition. Not one done at the hands of thieves in power. A coercive currency destruction is chaos, like Weimar Germany. A voluntary transition to a better currency will be like a flower blossoming. Everything becomes cheaper and standards of living will rise dramatically worldwide. Will be like the switch from horse buggies to cars. Those who owned or manufactured buggies lost, but everyone became wealthier due to better transportation. Creative destruction of the marketplace. Banks and other industries will die or evolve. But the world will be richer because we won't need to spend vast amounts of wealth to move money around.

No, libertarians aren't the only ones that understand bitcoin, but it certainly helps. It helps to understand that decentralized systems are possible and beneficial.

This is a popular misconception here. He put money into bitcoin, which helps boost the price and encourage other investors/entrepreneurs to invest in the bitcoin economy.

Correct, but they usually air different/older episodes for that. We'll see.

This was a teaser/promo segment for stossels one hour long episode that aired yesterday (Thursday). Topic was the federal reserve. Bitcoin wasn't the focus of any single segment from the episode, but it was mentioned at least half dozen times. Ron Paul mentioned he wanted currency competition and said if people want to use bitcoin that's fine. Austan Goolsbee, brought in for the pro fed argument, mentioned bitcoin as well. James Rickards was a guest too.

I wasn't advocating for a gold standard. I want currency competition, separation of money and govt.
If we did have a free market of money, and assuming digital currencies weren't invented yet, the market would likely should gold as money. People would offer different ways to transact in gold, without the inconvenience of subdividing physical gold. We've seen one example already. In the 19th century and prior, people would store their gold in banks, and receive a receipt for their gold. People would transact in their daily transactions with their paper receipts for convenience, instead of subdividing physical gold. Then, anyone could take the receipt back to the bank at any time to redeem the physical gold. The banks would compete with each other on trust. This mostly free market system was then destroyed through monopolization by govt in the early 20th century, and later removed the gold backing. Same type of system could work with digital, instead of paper, receipts. Though it would necessitate the use of a 3rd party, a problem that digital currencies don't have.
I was merely pointing out that subdividing physical gold is only one approach to solving the problem of day to day transactions in gold. Paper and digital representations of gold would make that easier. The market finds new solutions. 
I do think digital currencies are better forms of money than gold.

There is no precedent. The world has never experienced a hyper-monetization event.

You can't get rid of debt. You either pay the debt, or you default. And the US govt will default on its debt one way or another. No way they can pay back the 17+ trillion in debt they have accumulated. 
You never really explain how bitcoin allows the govt to default on its debt. The lenders are expecting to be paid back on their loans with dollars that have value. Do you think the govt is going to declare bitcoin legal tender, declare the dollar dead, and not follow through on obligations to pay back lenders?
I think it's premature to declare which countries are pro and anti bitcoin.

It could work if you used paper or digital representations of gold. Like e-gold. But obviously that necessitates 3rd parties like banks.

No one knew how crappy the post office monopoly was until someone created alternatives like FedEx, email, etc. Everyone mailed their letters, and communicated at a snail's pace and assumed this is how life has to be.
Same will be true for this fiat money monopoly.

There is no rule in the universe that lucky people can't or shouldn't become wealthy. Thousands of years ago, the first people that discovered that gold was useful as a medium of exchange also became wealthy by mining/saving gold. Who are we to judge who should and shouldn't become wealthy? That is for the marketplace of individuals to decide.

Exactly right OP. It's like in monetary history, when paper  receipts for gold in the bank got traded around so much that the receipts themselves became currency. People weren't trading their receipts back into gold, except out of fear, bank runs, etc. That's how I understand it anyway. This was before govts monopolized paper money and set up central banking. 
Gold probably had a similar start in ancient times. Before mass acceptance, people used gold to trade, but many had to be fearful of getting stuck with useless yellow rocks, so they would have quickly converted it into real assets: food, land, etc. But after mass acceptance, saving in gold became mainstream. Quite interesting when you think about it.

There are ~10 billion ounces of gold in the world. There are currently only 12 million bitcoins in the world. That's a 1000 magnitude difference.

Frontline did a report on an industry I'm knowledgeable about. Their reporting was quite flawed, misleading, superficial, pro-govt, anti-free market.
