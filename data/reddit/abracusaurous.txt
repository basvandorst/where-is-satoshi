Don't forget; Japanese names are reversed. Nakamoto Satoshi would be the original Japanese reading.

Bic Camera is a cool store but the people there have no clue about anything other than vaccum cleaners and hair dryers. I spoke to a staff recently about paying with Bitcoin and they were totally clueless. It's too bad.  If you have proof of the transaction I would just keep hounding them politely until they refunded you or at least issue the value in store points or something.

Its kind of tucked away from Harajuku Street but it's really close to the Deus Ex coffee shop.

That sounds infuriating. A lesson to others perhaps; don't store large amounts in exchanges. They can behave like banks. I hope you can resolve this and access your coins!

The only way to avoid forking open source software is to close off the source code. Forking is also one of the ways to upgrade open source code. When it comes to Bitcoin, aren't the miners the real software 'users?' Thus they can decide to use whichever version is being maintained in the way they see most useful.

I guess I should clarify that my comparison with banks isn't in the denial of access or taking someone's money. Rather the amount of bureaucracy required to to manage your own funds. Thanks for your opinion though!

Bitflyer is a pretty good exchange. They have a verification option for foreign document holders registering from outside Japan. Also the playstore app is in English. I use it here in Japan.

Bic Camera is probably the only major store to accept Bitcoin currently in Japan. They recommend the bitflyer wallet. You can create an account online from anywhere. For the play store you could set the store to Japan, download the app, then reset the store back to your locale. I've had to do that here in Japan to get apps from abroad.

I'm not sure but if you download a VPN and run it on your system via a Japan IP then log out and log back into the store, you might be automatically directed to the Japan store. I do not know if this will impact your country change limits. 
Alternatively, You could install from a .apk file.
