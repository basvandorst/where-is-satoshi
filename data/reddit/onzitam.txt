nothing  instant. once i have been verified and was able to withdraw they send me this:




1. You will need to ask your bank to verify your recent BPAY payment to us. They will need to give a letter stating the amount, date, and other details of this BPAY.
2. Get your Government issued Photo ID and Bank Statement (from where you sent us BPAY) attested by your Bank or Justice of Peace as ‘True Copy’.




this is not mentioned anywhere when you sign up. 
its not friendly nor fast service. DO NOT USE
