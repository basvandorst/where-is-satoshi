I'm a Trezor customer and have not received the phishing email so hopefully it's external.

Its by far the best looking blockexplorer but I certainly would not be trusting their wallet services.
@_date: 2016-08-08 07:32:46
Absolutely, they could have created them in Ethereum in a few minutes and done it properly.
Not to mention the intrinsic 'extra' value they would likely carry in that scenario, that and they would have a much higher likelihood of being pumped on Poloniex, giving hack victims a better chance of recovering their investments.
@_date: 2016-08-10 20:51:01

It was no possible to roll back for Mt Gox because no one knew where the coins were or when they were taken, possible months earlier.
Also IIRC there was no roll back proposed currently just a re-org of transactions from miners 51%ing the network but its not happening so no point thinking about it any further.

I'm really just guessing and using the info I learned from watching the last few major exchange hacks but I personally believe they will resume trading to allow alt withdrawals (Eth / Etc / Ltc and what ever else was not effected) but all USD &amp; BTC will be liquidated to put towards repaying the losses.

No limit on block size, we could have 8gb blocks today (With a hardfork).
Miners &amp; nodes would not be able to properly relay these blocks in their current form, they would need far upgraded bandwidth, storage &amp; memory...

I'm all for hardforking bitcoin to PoS and doing away with the very concept of centralized miners. 
That or Luke Jr's earlier suggestion of a rolling PoW scheme, if its possible. 
The miners (All 4 of them) hold way too much power.
I would far prefer to see btc go back to the home gpu mining days, why not put it back in the hands of the people?

Except when you have a monopoly (51% of supply) with PoS no one can ever surpass you, however with a mining monopoly it can always be challenged.

What about if a new coin rose up (Ethereum is my bet) and all bitcoin users just naturally moved across to it due to superior features. I don't see how people would trust crypto less in this situation. 
However Bitcoin collapsing due to a serious technical flaw and 4+ billion worth of people's asserts vanishing into thin air overnight might infant be the nail in the coffin for all cryptos.

Pretty sure most people touted shopping and online commerce as bitcoin's major selling point for the first few years, it was certainly what got me interested all those years ago.

There's a guaranteed $800 price point on the halving?
What is far more likely is we will see a small rise approaching the halving then who knows what will happen, this is the crypto space after all, it could go up 15 times, stagnate or drop to new lows.

Nothing about bitcoin is free, its an illusion. Entry fees, exit fees, cheap transaction fees. 
They're still fees none the less so its somewhat dishonest to have any bitcoin marketing material like this making false claims, IMO. 
Still a good info graphic, I would assume it was made prior to 2012 / 2013 when no fee transactions were still a possibility.

Bitcoin is not the only coin vying for dominance, and there is one that already has 1/8th of bitcoins market cap and IMO is superior in a lot of ways. 
There is also a large divide in the bitcoin community which has been holding the price back for a while now, one camp wants larger blocks the other wants them to stay the same, larger blocks mean more transactions per second (Currently 7 tps in theory and closer to 3-4 in reality IIRC). 
The next two years will make or break bitcoin as it either scales or fades into insignificance.

I have not seen a single case of anyone claiming to have paid GST on an entire bitcoin purchase, I have although seen multiple cases such as btrade where they are absolved of GST requirements on a bitcoin exchange and instead only pay GST on their revenue form the sale..
ATO rules can be complicated and hard to understand, likely the reason for the upcoming tax law changes so people can stop applying for private rulings and just be covered by solid ATO rules. 
@_date: 2016-06-11 09:10:31


A word of caution for the wise, people tend to buy on rumor and sell on news.

@_date: 2016-06-11 11:00:10


Its essentially a 50% reduction in inflation for the system so long term yes, I believe it will lead to a steady price rise but there are so many more things effecting the price of btc presently than the halving that this may have no effect at all. 
It might have the opposite effect, considering the price has doubled form 12 months ago, potentially in anticipation for the halving, it might come crashing down again when nothing really changes next month, or not, no one knows is the only answer.

The halving is a 50% reduction in the block reward from mining bitcoin.
Presently if you mine a bitcoin block you will receive 25 coins, after halving, 12.5 coins. 
This process will continue until around 2140 when all coins are mined, although its very unlikely btc will still be around by then IMO.
@_date: 2017-01-20 00:11:46
That's really interesting, I had not considered merchants wouldn't need to switch one by one to an alt but it could be much more straight forward if the payment processor made the switch for them.

Umm.. Santander are firmly committed to building on Ethereum and are launching a product on the public chain in the the next 12 months.
@_date: 2016-11-24 23:06:31
Is that so?
I've said multiple times zec is heading to $5 - $10 range and wildly overpriced so not sure why you got that assumption from.

@_date: 2017-01-03 21:13:52
Rootstock is vapourware and if they ever launch it will be a centralised 3rd party solution.
No idea why anyone even compares it to ETH which was built from the ground up to do what it does well.

**&gt; On Wall Street, high frequency trading algorithms can make 10,000 trades per second. Wouldn't you agree that there's no way those trades should be on the blockchain?**  
I agree side-chains or another 3rd party solution backed by the blockchain would be more suited to this scenario.
**&gt;I have no desire to pay for my coffee with BTC. What's the point? It's way more convenient to use credit cards and debit cards. Centralized systems are way more efficient than proof-of-work will ever be.**
Actually I dream of a world that I can send btc to a unique address while sitting on a bus 10 min from my work and my barista will have my coffee ready to go and already paid by the time I arrive. 
**&gt;I hope, more than anything, that the two camps in the blocksize debate cherish decentralization.**
As do I, this current situation is only hurting bitcoin and has actually eroded some of my faith that btc will survive (never thought I would say that, I still hodl).
**&gt;Paypal, credit cards, debit cards, Ripple, and future centralized digital currencies will work way better than Bitcoin.**

I love seeing btc in the wild but I've said it before and I'll say it again, retail is the worst use case for btc.
It's online where btc really shines, making the process faster and easier with less risks for the customer.
However with retail it's the opposite.

I remember watching a Gavin Andersen video where he asks openly why Satoshi chose 10 min confirmation times and not shorter, he says it's the one question he would ask Satoshi if he could.
Changing the 10 min conf times is too far of a deviation from the white paper to ever be considered in the near term, IMO.

Ok so tomorrow rolls around and bitcoin goes mainstream all of a sudden, we have millions of new users in a short period.
What do you think they will do, ddos the network just as you put it with their legitimate transactions.
Might as well see what effect this will have on the network, I hope they clog it so much with their stress test its unusable for days on end, maybe then we will see the desperate need to larger blocks.

If you were savvy enough you could manually write you're own tx selecting which inputs to spend, I really think it should be a standard feature for wallets to let you select which input.

Unless this is a new ruling (been out of the loop for a week) you do not pay GST on Bitcoin you only pay it on the commission the broker or exchange charges if they're a GST registered Australian Pty Ltd.
For instance, I often buy coins from btrade Australia and they charge about $20 in fees so I would pay $2 GST on the entire purchase of 1 btc.
@_date: 2015-07-06 11:34:58
Yuk, it needs a facelift that's for sure. 
Apart from that its a smart idea to bring all the exchanges together at such an iconic web url and collect referral fees from them.

I'm a staunch bitcoin supporter but seriously, you want to convert 100k into bitcoin, send it to the UK and convert it back into fiat?

Let me guess, you're a fan of bitcoin as a settlement layer and would prefer only high value important transactions are done on the blockchain and all else are done on sidechains controlled by a ~trusted~ third party?
This is against the core values of bitcoin the way I see it, btc is for everyone, big and small.
@_date: 2015-08-02 17:16:58
Not trying to knock it as all adoption is good IMO but when we have daily news stories about billion dollar business and banks experimenting with and adopting btc I just don't think a cafe taking a new payment method is news.
To answer your question, yes I am aware of a cafe (a few suburbs away) that accepts btc and also a pub just around the corner from me.
Personally I think retail is possibly the worst use case for bitcoin.

Also another point is that you should not be relying on electrum while using bitsddress.org, just record the pub / private key directly from bitaddress and forget electrum completely, it's just one of many wallets.
In regards to hardware wallets, I.e. Trezor they are not really designed for long term storage but more as a wallet you can easily access at any time that has cold wallet level security.
If you plan on spending Bitcoin not just saving it in a safety deposit box, trezor is the way forward.

The halving means bitcoin supply cuts in half, in 2016 the coin reward will drop from 25 to 12.5 every 10 min and in 2020 from 12.5 to 6.25. 
Some say the halving is priced in well before it happens, I'm skeptical though.

If you're thinking long term storage (12+ months), create a paper wallet or buy a trezor.
I'm on mobile so can't post links but there are hundreds of good guides posted here.
Essentially just download an offline copy of bitaddress.org and run it on an offline computer and print the private / public key.
Follow a guide though, there are multiple extra steps to ensure it really is cold wallet level security.
Personally I just use trezor.

Last time I checked, the market caps were something like this:
Bitcoin - $6.5 billion market cap
Ethereum - 500 million market cap
And these are the market caps when Bitcoin is at its lowest and &gt;Ethereum is at its highest. Ethereum is currently overpriced and &gt;Bitcoin is currently underpriced. Some would even say ETH is &gt;currently in the peak of a bubble. So what were you saying?

Considering the scrutiny the code has been under for all this time I believe as long as you're using it correctly, on a Ubuntu live usb not connected to the internet ++, bitaddress is as trustworthy as it gets.

There are plenty of ways it could go to zero, however unlikely. A major unpatchable technical flaw would be one of many.
@_date: 2016-02-18 05:00:30
Its all about the use case, I've said it before and I'll say it again, brick-n-mortar locations are the WORST use case for bitcoin. 
Cash or cards work perfectly over a counter, bitcoin's true value is in online payments where it can actually save you time using it rather than the other way around. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 08:24:30
Yes personally I would just skip all the electrum stuff, the seed is something that only relates to electrum.
And yes, I'd Bitcoin is still around in 20 years it is guaranteed all you will need is your private key as Bitcoin is built around that, unlike an electrum seed which is a third party add on.
Personally I use a trezor as I don't completely trust myself to securely generate and store my private keys.
@_date: 2015-08-13 08:47:18
Slush is truly a captain of industry!
Even if his pool is small in comparison these days it's important to remember how long he's been around and what he has done for the bitcoin community.
This is a very intelligent person were talking about, he started the first mining pool, created the stratum protocol, then went on to create trezor (team effort I'm sure).
Slush's opinion weights heavily with me.

I have to agree that is just an echo chamber at times, if you look outside this sub, where the majority of crypto enthusiasts now hang out to discuss things, the view is much more negative towards bitcoin's potential success as the leading crpyto. 
I see people in here throw around the word shitcoin / pump &amp; dump while the people in the subs they're referring to are busy bringing about the crypto 2.0 revolution.

@_date: 2016-07-25 23:23:01
Precisely, you load a paperwallet and then completely sweet it and create a new one I don't see how that's encouraging address reuse.

The network is jammed full and running at capacity, depending on the fee you paid it could be anywhere from 5 min to 24 hours.

And then screenshot the image and upload that version.

This thread is discussing segwit2x and how it just reached miner super majority.
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:46:14
No, Changetip just shut down. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:30:22
The transaction fee, it would have been paid by the exchange as I'm assuming you bought the bitcoin from there so you don't need to worry about it. 
You can put you wallet address in here  and see if it has arrived or if it is still waiting to be confirmed by the network.
Best of luck!

I know you're probably joking but in case you're not, Eth's algo is ASIC resistant.
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:40:52
4x more nodes, dominated by home GPU miners, Foundation is self funded with no investors, remind me again how it's more centralised?
@_date: 2016-07-30 22:13:58


I'm curious if you consider the current version of bitcoin "the real thing" or only the pre hard-fork version with 180+ billion bitcoins in the system...
@_date: 2016-07-24 00:14:40
* 60 million + 12 million + 18million = ~90million
* 60 million - is the Pre-sale.
* 12 million - is the dev fund, 0.2coins per 1 coin sold in the crowdsale.
* ~18 million - 1 million coins mined per month for 18 months prior to going from POW to POS.

Are you expecting / hoping they'll also come down on all the Bitcoin related ICO's that have happened?
Once upon a time this community was anti-regulation, wonder what happened.
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:24:19
Explain to me how the promised 2mb block upgrade will happen without a hard fork. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 05:05:04
lol... move along nothing to see here.
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:40:17
Another low effort shit post.
Don't you have anything better to do?
@_date: 2017-06-10 00:12:36
Only that they are considering digitising their currency and putting it on a public blockchain. Huge news if you ask me.
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:45:53
I'm honestly interested, why do you even care?
The majority of the community got together, did a carbonvote using their Eth to actually prove that they even had a stake in the project and then decided to go ahead with The DAO fork.
It was only the people with zero Eth and basically no right to have an opinion that caused the biggest uproar and still seem to harp on about it.
I doubt we'll see any future hf's to return lost or stolen funds, it was widely accepted as a one time only event due to the seriousness and magnitude of the problem, also the fact that the network was still in alpha stage.
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:42:58
If you read the title of this post very clearly you might be able to decipher the fact that both economic and miner majority have agreed to segwit then hf to 2mb blocks.
Not sure why you seem to think your opinion of what's going to happen trumps that of the business' and miners with hundred upon hundreds of millions standing behind what they say.
If users want to continue to use bitcoin and not get forked off the network then they will upgrade, just like they did all 5 times the second most popular coins hf'd.
Also, where do you get your stats for 80,000 full nodes? Last I checked there was 7,500.
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:52:13
No need to wait that long, 2 weeks should suffice ��
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:08:10
Do you really believe that nonsense?
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:44:45
Dollar cost averaging is generally a decent strategy, however with $300 like the person above said it's not really going to change your life dramatically if you lose a percentage of it so might as well jump right in.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:06:39
It can't be mined with Bitcoin mining equipment, Graphic cards only.
@_date: 2017-06-10 01:34:01
I agree they will certainly be in control of central banks and  be permissioned. 
The main ones I have read about, Russia and Singapore, seem to be conduction their tests on Eth with the goal to use the public chain so that's at least some positive.
@_date: 2016-07-15 00:52:35
@_date: 2016-07-15 00:59:42
I see what you did there!
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:57:37
You forget most Eth lovers are former Btc hodlers and have seen some shit.
Also as the other comments said, the DAO caused a 6 month bear market that most held tight through.
@_date: 2017-06-02 16:34:53
They used a smart contract incorrectly and lost their Ether, this has nothing to do with multiple implementations or hardforks.
It was purely technical incompetence.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:10:31
I only make educated guesses, I've always been in crypto for the long term and definitely don't try to time the market.

Yeah.. apart from AlphaBay the largest DMN accepting it.

No one is going to spend tens of millions designing ASICs for it only to have them made obsolete on the switch to PoS in 12 months.

It sounds like they didn't lose 100k but instead made it...

You sound very naive.

I could predict the price would rise around the halving, why can't someone predict the price will drop around a contentious chain fork?
It's going to be madness and very bad for btc as a whole, likely the whole crypto ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:22:21
You seem positive you speak for the entire bitcoin community and know exactly what these so called 80,000* nodes are planning to do.
