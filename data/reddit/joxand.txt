Nice comment bro

This is new: I didn't know they were all one company.

Got, not fell to. Also, my name is not David. I did not report a bug or anything, so there.

Got it just two hours ago. Reported as phishing.

Hence why I didn't fall for it.

His left ball? He could buy a 370z for that money.

Is it possible to extend the bitcoin 'source', so to speak, to giving an address to send bitcoins to? I am in favour of this, quite a good idea. Kudos to you!
@_date: 2013-05-19 20:08:34
stuck on the third one.

I think they are going to notice when there is a ˜600 SGD drop from my bank account.
Sadly, jobs are out of the question (secure your education!), even when (honestly speaking), the school I am at now in Singapore sucks. They are covering stuff I covered in London a year to two years ago and I am just wasting my time here. I have... what, 6 mBTC in my wallet now after spending 24mBTC to buy stickers for a paper wallet I am to make. Stupidly bought when 1 BTC was about 440. Ah well.
Sorry for the wall of text and ramble.

I feel bad for you, man. I am kicking myself now when I realised that if I invested back when 1BTC was around 10 cents, I'd be rich. Now all I have to do is wait for the bull run.
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:14:50
Yes, USD 0.1, which is .2 mBTC or 0.0002 BTC.

From a kid whose parents will not let him invest in any amount regardless of price, I am jealous yet happy for you at the same time.
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:58:41
14M here, might do Bitcoin as a project for Economics. The main thing preventing me from jumping on the bandwagon is the lack of funding. Ah well, at least I have 29 mBTC. Not too bad. As of now, cruising through school.

Fourteen, feel forty. does stuff I only dreamt of doing. Bitcoin at twelve? Dang. I'm just here watching the markets. Python and coding at twelve? I did VB a bit back in 8th grade, but that was it. 
Kudos to you, man!
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:56:27
My bank account only allows withdrawals when the passbook is present. In Singapore, it's hard to buy Bitcoin in fiat. I guess I can go the Litecoin route and mine some - planning on getting a rig after my exams.
@_date: 2013-11-16 06:26:02
Hate to be a pain in the nether region, but why is 12 million so significant? Why not 10.5 million- half the bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:47:54
Same. I used to have .03 BTC from a bitcointip which I then spent on stickers for paper wallets (those holographic ones). I plan on getting a mining/multipurpose rig after the exams for fun.

Pay off all your taxes and buy off your house if you are renting (don't even know if that's possible - buying from the landlord)?. Pay off road taxes for the next few years. Sell/splurge some to get rid of that ants-in-pants feeling, then place your leftover bitcoins in a paper wallet - something like a metaphorical safe. Buy a fireproof safe.
I suggest [this]( to make the wallets. Seal the wallets with tape (again, [same link]( Follow all instructions on [there]( - you have enough bitcoins to have the need to be **that** paranoid.
Apologies if the buying-house-from-landlord idea is not possible - I know next to nothing about properties.

I don't buy really anything. My mother calls me 'all in, no out', meaning that I save everything and spend (next to) nothing. Thanks for the tip.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:30:20
345 on BitStamp. Not bad.

Dad says it's better than nothing. Granted, but I want to make a profit. I don't want to make a loss. 
@_date: 2013-09-11 11:56:46
I want to, but my parents are afraid that I'll lose all my investments by selling when it hits a low. This is with money they technically owe me.
I'm fourteen for clarification's sake. Of course, I won't buy miners now (all the ASIC companies' machines either won't ROI at worst-case-scenario difficulty or stand a low chance.

Sorry, Brian. I'll use Ava's wallet.

Money costs money. Money can be used to buy money. Inception, non?
@_date: 2013-05-14 05:58:00
Ah... so it wan't a GPU-heavy rig, it was a full package thing... So what were your budgets like?
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:59:14
Tell them that you will invest only a small amount of money into BTC - it's not a stock, so you don't have to buy unit quantities of Bitcoin - you can buy mBTC or uBTC, even.
@_date: 2013-05-13 20:30:31
Nice. 14 myself too, just that I was too much of a hermit so I just looked at the world going by... What were your budgets for each machine? (Am mostly interested in the 7850/6870 one, doing a rig myself soon (£1000 limit)). Thanks!

Easy as that seems, it is nigh-on impossible.

23 cents is better than 0 cents. A little blessing is better than none.

How did I not see this earlier?
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:10:50
Really? Washing the car? This is my opinion, but should that not be for elementary school? 8th grade is the bridge between childhood and maturity, not babyhood and childhood.

It also is more or less 1 gold/platinum ounce. Coincidence?
