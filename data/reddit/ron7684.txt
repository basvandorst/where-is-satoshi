Just use [LocalBitcoins](
Super fast, no holds, no limits. 
@_date: 2016-08-20 00:16:26
You can use [Localbitcoins to find PayPal trades]( You will likely have to upload identification but as the buyer in a PayPal-&gt;BTC transaction you are not at risk for any scams other than identity theft ;)

You can use [LocalBitcoins to buy bitcoin peer to peer]( Since LocalBitcoins is only a marketplace platform they are very lax on security, but as a buyer this is actually of benefit to you. Give them a try, it's super fast, zero hassle, and has practically unlimited payment options (they allow anything that anyone will accept).

Bitcoins will never all be mined, they will forever divide since the protocol can be modified for greater precision than 100,000,000 units per BTC. The real question is who will confirm transactions if bitcoin does not continue to increase value and the block reward becomes too small to cover electricity costs.

@_date: 2016-08-23 03:24:38
Scam and a half, at least they're honest though. It looks like they take your deposits and invest in other HYIPs while doing risk management to decide when to get out. They take the profit above 3% daily from other HYIPs and take zero risk if they fuck up and need to close.

There is definitely a cloud mining market, legitimate ones are just few and far between. I personally trust Hashnest.co as they are a subsidiary of Bitmain (which manufactures physical miners); the hardware used is clearly specified, the terms make sense (although I do believe they make money on electricity fees), and they have been around for a long time. 
@_date: 2016-08-20 00:28:46
That is exactly the risk. If you find a reputable seller with a long and strong history on Localbitcoins they likely won't scam you for this amount as a scam report could cost them their entire account (which generates much more daily in commissions than you would be spending here).

Consider not fully abandoning fiat; think about whether your problem here is really *the banks* or *the fiat system* as a whole, then make educated investment choices based on that. **Bitcoin is a volatile instrument**, and holding a 100% position in bitcoin (especially when you are new to it) is extremely risky.
**Get paid in fiat!** Using bitpay does not do anything to further your ethical argument, the banks will actually get a bigger piece of your action since bitpay is paying higher fees to banks as a business. You'll just end up paying more in fees once you need to convert it back to fiat.
If you want to abandon the banks I would suggest a split between several instruments such as gold, silver, platinum, bitcoin, fiat securities, and cash.
It sounds like you have Bitcoin fever. Take some time and consider your actual options here. **Paper wallets are stupid, you are missing a lot, your ideas do not make sense, and there are better ways of doing what you want to do.**
I realize this is not but please stay smart here. The last thing we need is someone else ranting about how bitcoin sucks because they went 100% and then it crashed; this would be the fault of your investment choices, not bitcoin.

He's our regular bartender at our neighborhood bar so we are there quite often and treat him well as it is. Getting an extra 2 visits worth of tips is not so above and beyond. What makes this cringe worthy for you? Is it the flaunting of wealth?
Also, as a bartender, he is already paid to act differently. We tip well because we want him to do something for us (provide prompt and friendly service). In this situation I was willing to tip him an extra $30 because I wanted him to do something for me (get excited about Bitcoin)

Don't be a hater. This guy has money but I gave him a little push. Maybe now he might make a real investment into it, and if he comes to me for it I will make sure that he understands everything he can about it and uses a hardware wallet. The value transacted was not important and I told him that because he used express setup he has no backup seed. If he loses the $50 it's really nbd to either of us. He was tipped through standard means as well.

No. You sold bitcoin. They pay their suppliers in USD, not BTC. The smart thing to do would have been pay in BTC for convenience, but immediately replenish your stash. Unless BitmainTech wants to speculate on BTC, which I cannot confirm or deny (but I suspect they do not), they immediately trade BTC payments for USD so that they don't go bankrupt if BTC crashes.

1. It would be shown as a fiat balance. Deposits are not automatically converted to BTC if that's what you're asking.
2. Kraken does not offer fiat deposit protection in the USA, not sure about EU.
You would want to look for the EU equivalent of FDIC (USA). Have a look at [wikipedia]( to see who would insure in your particular country and then ask Kraken.

Nope. You sold bitcoin. Look at the endgame, you gave up 3.4 btc for $1985 worth of hardware ($584/btc). If you went with batch 3 you would have given up 2.8btc for $2085 worth of hardware ($745/btc).
**1. You effectively sold 3.4 bitcoin the moment you spent it on an item pegged to USD.**
**2. They bought bitcoin when they received btc for an item they paid for in USD**
**3. Your miner is not worth 3.4btc, it is worth $1985USD.**
I really don't want to bother explaining this any further, you're making us all look bad.

Both CUC and CUP are pegged to USD so this question just displays your ignorance.


If the book company pays it's costs in CAD and can continue to pay the same CAD amount even with a USD/CAD rate crash, then yes you are. Eg. You pay USD$20 today for a CAD$25 book that cost the company CAD$15 to produce (arbitrary numbers here), if you offered to sell me this book for USD$20 I would buy it from you because it is fair. However, tomorrow CAD crashes and CAD$25 is only USD$10, if the company continues to produce the book for the same cost in CAD, I would not purchase the book from you for USD$20 because I could now buy it for USD$10. Therefore, you have sold your USD for CAD at 1:1.25 and missed out on holding it until tomorrow when it would be worth 1:2.5. This works because (and as long as) the company still receives CAD$25 for their book and it still costs CAD$15 to produce (basically as long as the cost of the book, cost of employees, and cost of living does not change because of the USD/CAD rate crash). Now if the company paid USD to produce the book but sold it in CAD, the CAD price would go up after this change in exchange rate because it still needs the same amount of USD to pay its suppliers, employees, etc.
The difference in your questions here is that other currencies have stable purchasing power. If Bitmain could pay their suppliers and employees in bitcoin (and wages and prices were set in btc) then your arguments would hold. However, **no one gets paid a set wage in btc**, you can be paid in btc but it will always be a floating amount that was converted from a set value in fiat at the current btc/fiat rate.
Also, yes, Bitmain sells the bitcoin they make, maybe not all of it and maybe not immediately but anything they don't sell is considered an investment in the currency (which is not part of BitmainTech's ASIC miner manufacturing business model).
When jobs start to pay 0.01btc/hour or some other set rate, your argument will be valid; until then, USD is king... and you sold your btc for USD.

There will likely be no such thing. The block reward will continue to halve and, if Bitcoin ever makes it to a 1 satoshi block reward, precision will likely have already increased well beyond 8 decimal places. 21 million is a [mathematical limit]( and does not require an actual stoppage in reward payout.
For example, start with 1 and keep adding half of the current number to the total sum. Eg. 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ...  We might /say/ the sum of this series (the limit) is 1 but it will never actually get there.
@_date: 2016-06-17 04:08:28
