The protocol does not care or define the start of each day.
bc.i starts the clock at the first data point which means its day begins at 18:15:05 GMT. bc.i's day begins at bitcoin's time of birth.
Presumably you start your charts by rewinding to the morning of the first block 0:00 GMT. Still 24 hour periods, different start time.

It seems this transaction has an invalid P2SH signature, deliberately crafted to cause problems for miners running old clients.
 
The blockchain underwent a soft fork in order to introduce P2SH functionality. miners that didn't upgrade would accept P2SH transactions but wouldn't check the signature. Therefore miners which didn't upgrade would accept this transaction as valid while new clients would reject it, effectively killing any block mined containing it.

A stealth address allows you to share a single identifier which multiple people can use to send you payments without the other parties knowing who else has already paid.
If you are very disciplined you can achieve the same anonymity in most existing wallets by ensuring you use a new address for each incoming payment. Stealth addresses are an easy way to force you to use a new address for each incoming payment.
It doesn't mask the public key of the transaction. If you lookup a the transaction on blockchain it will still show what coins moved from one address to the other. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 11:49:50
If really you have 300+ low value transactions then the transaction is probably exceeding the maximum number of inputs you can spend in a single transaction. 
Try splitting the payment into 3 transactions of 1 BTC each.

If your coins wallet got compromised previously logging in through tor without the onion you will need to setup a new wallet. 
Once a wallet is compromised once the private keys can be copied, hence changing the password will not make any difference.
