Nah, it’s a biggie line. Lin used it from biggie, so I think biggie should retain the credit.

Without giving them props, then yes. That would be cultural appropriation. And I can see how from my comment it comes across that way, but he does credit these artists like Biggie and Prodigy in multiple ways, throughout interviews and even in printed versions of he plays I think. He also heavily supports the culture, such as having protests against trump, he has a Hamilton Mixtape with NUMEROUS black artists, and by having a majority of the people in his own play black. If you both respect and support the culture that you are benefitting from, it’s not appropriation. It’s simply cultural exchange. And Lin has proven that he does both many times.

Mmm, nope. Not cultural appropriation lol. Not only in Lin another type of minority, but the play from which this line is used is color-blind and predominantly black. He also grew up in New York City, where Biggie was from. The play is littered with New York Rap references, it’s not cultural appropriation lol

I put all the available money I had in at $7,358 late October and had to wait 10 days. In that time it tanked to like $5,400 and I thought "Great, the first major financial decision I made as an adult (I'm a college freshmen) and I fuck up." If it weren't due to those 10 days of not being able to sell I would have lost money. Now look at me :)

Lmfao, you can spin that any way you want. One gives nourishment to the poor and hungry, one inspires the creative minds of children and adults everywhere, and one allows people to buy illegal drugs easier. 
I’m all for the promotion of crypto, but this kind of rhetoric is pointless since these things can’t be compared to each other equally.

Why did it go down in the first place then? Genuine question.
