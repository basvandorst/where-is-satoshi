How can you tell? I would love to be Samsung and provide useful primitives to many altcoin hashing algorithms, some glue logic and you are done. They are the boss of ddrs after all and those algos are memory bound.
Edit: reading the original press release  it looks like they might have been contracted by a mining company, Samsung didn't decide to fill spare fab time with mining asics on their own.

If you are skeptical of the LN, I believe you either must have no stake on the success of Bitcoin or really not care to keep having a neutral attitude in this debate. I've been neutral for two years before making this account.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:14:42
LN itself scales much worse than BTC does and moving traffic to higher layers isn't a scaling solution.
Pruned nodes are a scaling solution. Light wallets are a scaling solution. Header first mining is a scaling solution.
This community telling itself LN is a scaling solution is the reason I'm out. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:15:39
Two weeks.

The two scaling methods currently debated have two different centralisation issues:
1) Non mining node centralisation problems, where maybe having access to the whole history of transactions might take something in the order of TB/PB/EB but you can still transact on the main network with no intermediary by using a light wallet or a pruned node.
2) Having to lock your money in what is basically a settlement layer where LN nodes also have to lock big chunks of money to let you transact - guess what, the LN nodes will ask you for fees, the fees are not going to the miners and given the network architecture big central nodes are incentivised as the higher the number of hops the higher the money that needs to be blocked for every transaction (and the higher the fees, among other problems).
Question. What is the closest real world example to 1? Nothing? To 2? Banks? Do we really want to re-implement banks?

LN is (will) be forced upon bitcoiners by keeping the 1MB limit, maybe a 2MB or other very small limits in the future. If a Bitcoin transaction is $100-1000, you don't have a choice. You need to use the LN. You also can't open a channel with everyone, as that also requires an onchain tx and that's expensive. The incentives are all against small timers doing normal transactions. They will need to open a channel with a big hub (where lending cost/fees are low) and use that. The bigger the LN node, the lower the fee, the higher the incentive for people to use that node. It's literally the definition of banks, or of centralisation. 
Even the idea of opening a channel for $100 to have the big benefit of depositing my next month's worth of expenses (say, $1000) is so silly it's just stupid. 50% (?) or so of people live week by week. That's half the users you are cutting off upfront.

No, sorry, this is too much fun and I'm waiting for you all down the river.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:21:00
Yeah sure, good luck sending me invalid blocks with the right number of zeros in front of the hash root. Because it totally makes sense to do so when you could instead use them to get the block/fees reward, right? Jeez.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:51:40
Fair enough. I believe if you read the last post chain I was writing here you might agree with me that wasn't my goal. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:03:30
Enjoy your central nodes with much money at stake in a big-hub based network.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:47:58
In what world is header first mining plain dumb? I won't answer to your statement about the LN because it's a religion at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:19:20
I've already lost my 10 minutes with my last answer here, sorry. I will prove you right in your accusations by not answering. Keep on scaling... With a different product.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:56:07
How can you even compare SPV mining with header first mining? One just says "fuck the blocks I only need the headers of the longest chain" the other says "yeah maybe I don't need to verify the whole merkle three for the first 30 seconds of me mining but I will ditch this if 30 seconds go by and I still can't prove I'm doing something right here".
@_date: 2018-05-05 11:06:22
I'm tired of seeing this undocumented rhetoric. You have no proof or reason to suggest the account was purchased, or ver being a fraudster. Reputation assassination campaigns don't count. There are plenty of people that used to be involved with bitcoin and got back to be a voice in this split.
@_date: 2019-11-10 10:18:02
Back in the days there used to be a way to find an used BTC address using the first few characters of the address, say the first 10. blockchain.info used to do that.
Is there any service doing this nowadays?
@_date: 2017-08-03 07:45:08
What if you only kept balances instead of transaction history? Leaving the latter to the tax agencies? A free 10x storage space saving? Madness, right?
@_date: 2017-08-03 07:51:22
Agreed, but you could have those clients alongside full storing ones. Just consider it a different type of lightweight wallet only with no need to use external servers. So that people with a thing for RPis in here can have a node and the rest of the network can have more transactions.
@_date: 2019-11-15 13:39:40
Average age 21? Starting an exchange out of nowhere with 800k and a team of 20, in 2020? Jeez good luck.
@_date: 2017-08-27 08:10:27
Well, discovering pruned nodes work on this exact mechanism was demoralising. I assumed they didn't given the much higher disk usage, that is basically just hashed transactions + 6 months of data I guess. Meh.
Disagreed on storage, it's as big of a problem as is bandwidth. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:36:46
No, they work out of magic. That's why ethereum isn't a bubble. /s.

Off topic question: I'm looking for a very old 2013-something Bitcoin video. The only line I remember is "the world is in economic disarray" and I can't find it. Anyone remembers it?

I haven't and I didn't.
@_date: 2019-04-25 07:41:12
The entire industry but upper layer "scaling" vested interests was supporting bitcoin2x, that's how you got your segwit "upgrade" before renegading on the 2x part of the agreement with all of that no2x soft fork bs. My blood still boils years later.
@_date: 2019-04-25 11:06:35


Users were gonna fork themselves off the network as intended before 2x. You can change the narrative for people that weren't there and newbies, but you can't change history or bully me into your narrative calling me a liar.
@_date: 2019-04-25 06:12:52
Have you seen their valuation? A third of a billion $? They must be promising magic unicorns to their investors to justify that, Trezor just kept reasonable as they didn't need to make things up for money.
Edit, also looks like the investment may have been linked to them outing their ceo:
Gauthier —  a seed investor and board member —  initially joined Ledger as its president, and will now reportedly be in charge of executing the company’s strategy and delivery of its products. In his letter, Gauthier said that he “will focus all of [his] attention and energy on growing an amazing tech company on both the retail and enterprise side.”
If so things can't be good.

Yep. I've heard in the past that sha256 is such a simple design it can be used to test and tune new processes. Sort of like a test bench for fabs, with the only difference being that you have paying customers. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:13:22
Yes, of course. You don't sell a money making machine for less money than you would make with it yourselves. But this minting process takes months, even years. Are you familiar with electronics manufacturing and how the costs scale? You want to sell as many of them as you can to bring the batch sizes up and costs down. Also, there is a risk with mining for the next 6+months, a risk you can offset by selling (or even pre-selling!) your units. It just makes business sense.
You are very wrong with your zero chance statement. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 10:17:53
How are bigger players entering the market not helping decentralisation? It's a race to the bottom, the bottom being not that far away unless we make some important discovery in physics. The endgame is everyone and your grandmother having access to sha256 designs for transistors of a few atoms, since that in the end the race will have to stop and open source projects will match those performances. This is great news. Let them compete. 
What wouldn't surprise me is Bitmain bringing a 7nm design out of the hat and delivering in the same timeframe. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:49:59
I would sell them because otherwise "just a little smaller megacorp2" will do it and take those sweet sweet profits away from me. I thought this was an economics subreddit?
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:07:50
Are you saying having bitcoin chips made in china equals having the manufacturer using them/stealing the ip and selling it in the black market/using them? Meh? Isn't it peanuts to them?
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:21:09
I spent many years thinking so, then I recently realised our cheap bitcoin mining wafers are going to be useless without the huge economies of scale Bitmain can emply in China, see for example how KNC closed shops simply because they were loosing money - and according to their calculations Bitmain must have been loosing money too.

Here is Sam Cole explaining why he thinks it still didn't make sense, even with asciboost:
(and that's why I meh every time I see this asciboost or bitmain campaign in here)
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:18:54
LOL. Not even with $100M. Best of luck.
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:14:01
And how is that different from paying chipworks to give you a rtl of the ics? Especially for bitcoin mining, where it's all the same thing over and over again? I mean yeah, ~~people~~ China will clone your product - welcome to electronics.
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:25:30
Decreasing block times would lead to higher overhead for light wallets, that you absolutely don't want. Reverse bloom filters, weak blocks, header first mining, etc., are what you can use to have bigger blocks with very little to no drawbacks. So, in other words, absolutely false.
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:42:16
Do you have any reason to make a ~30MB app a ~300MB one when better alternatives are out there? Are you gonna make a thin client use ~3000MB when you decide you need to keep 1MB and your block time needs to be 6 seconds?
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:07:33
You don't understand how thin clients work, do you? Do you want them to use 10x the space on say, smartphones?
