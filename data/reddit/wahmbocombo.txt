How do we know this is collision resistant?

This ones not bad, but it’s kinda more microBit or MilliBit level

No reason for any personal attacks here, try to stay civil.
You should consider looking up how past geopolitical regulations have affected other industries to get an understanding of why it’s good to have a diversified market during proving. History is a valuable teacher and reference to position yourself well for the future.

Libra isn’t crypto. They may have learned more during their meetings/debriefings that highlight its unique use cases and the market opportunity therein.  Doubtful that this poses any risk or competition to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-20 01:25:26
Clearly you did lol

Your crippling fragility is doing enough of that for both of us.

This. Thank you saying it.
@_date: 2019-07-20 00:12:03
Maybe. I see it as hedging our bets.  As long as one system survives we have a chance at a decentralized currency.

Classic whataboutism.  I’m not talking about everything in the universe, just BCH.  The limited deviation from the construct of the original coin make it a good potential safe haven in case of the undermining of BTC. We have yet to see the world government response to BTC, and should it be drastic, it would be good to have other implementations.  Simply put, biological imperative and evolution operate along the same philosophy.

You’re doing good work my friend! Praise!

I can understand why you have this belief, but until it’s tested by future events we haven’t experienced, we won’t know if that’s actually true.  Saying stuff like this is both hyperbolic and pure conjecture.
Personally, I don’t think this is true for two reasons, 1. I don’t believe Bitcoin itself will fail before it can innovate, 2. I believe there are enough variants that the idea will survive in some form.
@_date: 2018-08-04 03:18:01
Yeah, I agree.  They could use a metric that serves as a price point average of purchasing power towards various categories of goods.  So, as long as “the number” was about the same, people would know they’re getting paid the same amount of purchasing power.

Thank you.

And when it starts going up people will begin to complain of the inevitable crash or how “volatile” it is becoming.

Yes. Just yes.

I’m in the US and it certainly feels like the same but the news coverage has been falsely positive. I’m not an economic analyst, but it feels like things are getting tighter here too.  Kinda hoping this means good things for crypto holding its value, at least then I won’t completely lose my shirt.

Wow, this answers my question and gives me further to learn about lightning, thanks!

Can we get a new one with today’s price included and next years blank?
@_date: 2019-08-12 02:32:07
Right before right? Cause after the halvening the price will 200%
@_date: 2019-08-04 21:06:40
Sure! People tend to compare Bitcoin to the tulip craze or South Sea bubble.  
The tulip craze was in the 1600s with a Dutch trading company. The flowers had just gained popularity and their prices skyrocketed to the point where people negotiated in bulbs as if they were a substitute for money. Eventually the market collapsed since tulips can be grown (I.e. no scarcity) and be spoiled (no permanence). It became a financial lesson that if a money has no intrinsic value, it isn’t a money.
The south sea bubble was a stock during Isaac Newton’s time and it even beguiled him into some poor investments. The company was making a profit and so started issuing more stocks than they could back (like a Ponzi scheme). Eventually this also crashed and made people wary of bubbles in the stock market.  When people refer to a bubble, this is usually the earliest example pointed to and it is the chart they reference.
Much of Bitcoins activities resemble both of these processes, and indeed, the volatility of Bitcoin also reflects the South Sea bubble.  However, Bitcoin has inherent protections that prevent it from being completely analogous to these models.
Regarding tulips: Bitcoin can only be destroyed by negligence or will, but not by itself. It also cannot be created other than by way of protocol design. So while it may not have “intrinsic” value, it also cannot be devalued unless people believe to be so.  The faith in the Bitcoin market isn’t misplaced due to the security and trust system employed. And, probably most importantly, it’s utility as a medium of exchange will be resilient throughout price changes.  So it has some inherent uses that make it significantly different from the tulip craze, and in my opinion, make that that model not apply to bitcoin.
Regarding South Sea: yes the chart looks like bitcoins chart and it is somewhat a model of a bubble. But due to its resistance to forgery and overproduction this “bubble” may not pop, or at least not completely. One of the defining characteristics of a bubble is that eventually it pops. So if you believe in it’s security model then you can argue that this chart also doesn’t apply.
Sorry for the rambling post and lack of links. I’m on my phone :/.  Also, if you have new things you wanna discuss hit me up anytime! I like having these discussions hehe

Maybe we won’t be using Bitcoin (mp3s) anymore though. Maybe we’ll move to layer 2 solutions like Lightning Network or MimbleWimble (iTunes or Spotify). And the need for Bitcoin (mp3s) will be forgotten but it’s use behind the scenes will be ever relevant.

You could give them a tiny bit and then they might have some skin in the game.  If they get excited when their 20 turns to 40 it’d be hard to criticize your gains/losses.  Not a free idea, but an idea
@_date: 2019-08-04 18:40:23
Yay! Good vibes from this post! I think this attitude is what Bitcoin and crypto should foster. Good on you!
@_date: 2019-08-12 02:33:16
It’s neither good nor bad.  It means the supply to market is being reduced, so the value of existing bitcoin may go up to adjust for the reduction.  At least this is conventional thinking.

It’s gonna go down because fiat values support crypto until whenever they become decoupled.

First the innovation is realized, then it is implemented, then it is made efficient, then it is simplified, then it gets buried or obfuscated so the tech is seamless.
@_date: 2019-08-05 05:46:40
I think some will always allow it, especially during off peak

@_date: 2019-08-04 20:42:12
Yeah, that thought has crossed my mind. It’d be like a bank run, but a crypto run. But the best part would be that (if you chose wisely) the crypto wouldn’t be incredibly devalued after. News anchors are also very slow at understanding adoption of any new technology, and their audiences are probably perceived as being even less so. We’re still in the infancy of the adoption stage, so people will call you crazy and think you’re stupid. History is written by the victor.

20k by December followed by a small downtrend to 12-15k until the halvening.  Then a slow bull market until sept/oct when things try to moon/crash again, probably 30-50k.
