If Kim Jong Un would simply say he is Satoshi and invented Bitcoin (like the way he invented shoes, breathing, sunshine, getting up in the morning, etc. etc. etc.) we would own the N. Korean market.

you should HODL! you've got around 5k$ now, but it could be much much more in the future. Just think if you still had the BTC you sold for 50$...
(since you are out of the loop HODL=HOLD!)

I would totally use a social network called diarrhea because it was called that. absolutely, no joking
But seriously, I think this idea may be more amenable to the users online than it was in diaspora's day. Internet users have become more sophisticated, generally. Some things are ripe for rediscovery.
When yr ready, get a pr and marketing think tank together and let them name it

flights, hotels etc etc etc.
at least they're spending btc, its better for the economy than hoarding them.
despite the questionable personalities that the foundation likes to elect, I think they do good, important work. btc needs informed spokesmen and leaders at this early stage in the game. look at the "bitcoin rulebook" that regulators are working on...this is a direct result of TBF's work, without which we would still be battling senators convinced we are all terroist/child-pornographers/drug-dealing murder-for-hire wing-nuts. the us authorities have basically conceeded that they should join btc or be left behind. full credits to btc foundation!

There has been a lot of positive press recently. Regulators saying btc is more or less kosher, at least ok to proceed with moving towards regulation etc. which would account for wider acceptance as well as regulators and washington power types to get whaling into the game. not to mention; mining incomes are getting retarded.

I agree, however "give a man a fish/teach a man how to go fishing" applies here. There is a learning curve and I think most reasonably intelligent people can deal with that. In dire situations there is still Cassicus, and Hardware wallets will very soon be beginning to see the light of day. My advice to n00bz is to join bitcointalk (great repository of info) to download wallets and experiment with microtransactions (including backing up and importing keys) until they can successfully complete them several times over. Then they have to learn "cold storage" then its time to get a "never-on-the net" computer and go from there. by then btc ought to be worth 4 or 5 hundred each. and they will place better value on their security.

I used to go to a bar on queen west run by Jamez Bee in the 80s called "The Bee Hive" and he accepted Canadian Tire money at par. I spent a lot of Canadian Tire $ there, so I would imagine alt. currencies are kosher to buy alcohol with.
I am really surprised that none of the artisanal/hipster/farm-to-table places will accept it b/cuz btc is the ultimate off-the-grid, libertarian statement. but, ofc, hipsters are always too smart to listen to anyone aren't they?

"Satoshi is not "believed to be from the UK." He used both American and British English" 
sounds like a canuck to me. I constantly vacillate between British and US spellings due to the fact I was taught in school to write "honour" but adapted to my American friend's spelling of "honor" and the like. ofc, in an online society, this could mean he is from anywhere in the commonwealth and speaks to many americans. definitely not american-born tho. Yanks never honour the queen's english, ever.

If I had to pay for everything I "liked" online I'd stop "liking" pretty much anything! The "like" function has always had to do with politeness, as well as gratitude, which can lead to remuneration , yet courtesy costs nothing and to be polite thru a third party who collects a slice off the top every time I make it rain... I see this as not necessary once BTC has mass adoption- direct deposit of btc, discreetly and anonymously; just like classy people do. And only giving monies to content creators I want to *financially* support.

first make sure you never do transactions you are unsure about &gt; 0.01 btc until you learn your shiz. to learn shiz, go to bitcointalk. newbies section. ask questions. you will be ok.
PS, takes about 24 hrs for the "blockchain" to download, so your client, whilst still usable, will not show transactions completing until fully "synched"

What are you guys on about? Vancouver is a foodie paradise! There's so many good restaurants that the bar is set really high, not to mention the international variety.

@_date: 2013-05-16 02:00:06
no, the CIA's jurisdiction is outside the USA, and they need to be able to move money for bribes, paying off informants, etc, across international boarders anonymously. They can achieve this with BTC. Contrary to what the average Redditor likes to think, they ARE actually smart enough to use BTC anonymously.

The problem with the canadian dollar is the exact same as with the american dollar, only delayed by a couple years. The canadian economy follows the us economy in many ways due to the fact that canada relies on the usa for 80% of its foreign trade. When america's federal bank topples canada's will be soon afterwards. Then your digital dollars will be as worthless as your fiat dollars. just cuz its digital makes very little difference. i agree with usrn (as most of the btc community will) centralization is the problem.

ok- a little "devil's advocate" time here; 
 to get anywhere in western politics you have to have considerable financial backing. All the big names are from old money. Bitcoin is a great idea, and looking more and more viable every day, despite the bumpy ride. I would guess these monied politicos would be paying attention and if they are smart (as they are with their money) they have some holdings of btc in their portfolio. They just wanna make money like everybody else, I'm sure they consider it like buying a lotto ticket. will sit on their coins, keep mum, and hope this mofo goes through the roof like the rest of us do. I'm sure the fall of fiat has crossed their evil minds just like it has everyone else's. If the way most of us feel btc may turn out comes true, they wont want to miss that gravy train. besides, if you were TPOUS wouldn't you also be kinda pissed at the banks, twisting you by the short n curlies to make yourself look bad to every citizen, constantly needing to offer universally unpopular bailouts plans etc? POTUS is beholden to the banks. they put him in office. thats how it works. if i was prez, i'd be like "F*&amp;K YOU!, I hope this bitcoin done goes and bites you in the ass!" ofc, you can see why I'm not pres.
