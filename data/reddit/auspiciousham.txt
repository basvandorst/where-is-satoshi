There was a lot of money in Nortel too. 
When there is nobody left in line to buy, all previous transactions that defined the value immediately become meaningless.

So bitcoin has a whole bunch of infrastructure, so does Syria but I wouldn't want to live there.
You're putting a lot of weight on people having ties their wagons to bitcoin already, which you obviously have, but the majority of people only use it as a trading vehicle to get to other coins. If the crypto market wasn't so difficult to get fiat into vitocij demand would be significantly lower. There is no good reason to hold or use bitcoin. It's so volatile that in times of depression nobody wants to spend their devalued coins, and in times in boom everyone just Jack's off to how much money they could make so they hold. The very small minority is using bitcoin for anything useful and we're over a decade in. You may consider this success because you attribute value to all of the work that has gone into it, but that is all meaningless if there is no next buyer and at this point it's the same community of kooks buying from one another with each successive paycheck saying "guys we're so smart, we're going to be so right."
If one day you're insanely rich you can be incredibly happy with yourself for being right. More likely than not bitcoin will be best by something better. The network effect is very rapid these days.

Some better crypto will come out with built in volatility controls (staking) and the die hard bitcoin fan boys will run their circle jerk raw while refusing to change to the new tech that the younger generation adopts.

He's been touting gold for 15 years because of quantitative easing and inflation, using gold as a safe haven after an economic crash. The fiat financial system is extremely young and has the potential to entirely fail us. Peter Schiff invests in a lot more than gold but believes there is going to be a major financial crash, he's written books about it, it's not about trying to make the most money it's about staying stable in the aftermath of a complete market shift when inflation destroys the value of current currency.
Now whether you believe him or not is up to you, but he's not stupid, he's extremely wealthy, and he's a lot more educated, experienced and trusted in the investment and economic spaces than the Neanderthals that drag their knuckles through this sub.

Where is your proof that his clients have lost a lot of money for listening to him?

Beating the market is extremely difficult when the Fed keeps redoing QE every time the economy falters.  I completely agree with his perspective that they need to rip the band-aid off and let it happen, and look where we're at here, the entire years worth of gains wiped-out on the S&amp;P500, Russel2k, Dow, Nasdaq in days.  Sure he was wrong about when, but when you know it's going to happen because it has to happen, do you still keep betting against for the time being?

I don't need bitcoin to be rich. But I'll come back here in a year when it's gone down 50%

The price of something going up in the short-term is the exactly same idiocy that fuels the idea that bitcoin is great.
Bitcoin being $1k, $500, or $50k for any duration in time is irrelevant, will it does what it claims to, and do so successfully, is all that matters.  However the childish and ignorant speculation on price and how some big bullies are manipulating it rather than accepting the alternative reality that some people just want out, or that support isn't nearly as high as people believe it should be.  This sub is a joke, the subscribers only see the reality that they want to believe.

The same reason I read the news about Trump, some people just like to watch the world burn

God you idiots are incessant that everything bad is "whale manipulation"
Maybe bitcoin just sucks a giant donkey dick and people are catching on.
