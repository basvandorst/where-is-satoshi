There are way too many comments from people on here defending why using Bitcoin is better over USD that don't understand the way currency exchanges, markets, and an economy works. Sure you were able to pay for twice as much food for the homeless some days ago because between the time that USD was exchanged for Bitcoins and the point where they were exchanged back to USD to buy food, the exchange rate for USD to Bitcoins increased. That's great. I'm glad it worked out. However that doesn't mean that at some point the value of Bitcoins could drop to where Bitcoins can only buy half of what it could. For example, people might donate $1000 USD to buy Bitcoins to be used for charity. However, the currency drops after they buy the Bitcoins to where it's only worth $500 at the time you want to buy food or whatever charitable thing you are doing.
Also, if Paypal has such a large processing fee for transferring USD, then either find a better service or try to start your own and charge less.
The problem with Bitcoins are that they aren't backed by anything and only have value because people right now say that they have value.  It could fail at anytime.  Sure the only reason that USD has value is because we all agree it does. However, USD is backed by the Federal Reserve and the US Government which are powerful entities that also say it has value, which makes USD a currency that is exponentially harder to fail.
I think Bitcoin is a cool idea. But people need to get a grip on reality and understand its uncertainty and volatility. It's pretty risky right now.
