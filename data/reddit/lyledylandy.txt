With that amount you could probably get in direct contact with a couple of exchanges and sell in bulk at a discount, or, you know, become an exchange yourself

So since you've made more transactions I assume your remaining balance didn't turn into unconfirmed like mine, right?

Did this earlier today, sent all my funds to Electrum, although I really like multibit interface

Almost 24 hours without confirmation, surely I could've avoided this with a higher fee but honestly for a casual user who just wants an easy way to pay some stuff this is pretty disheartening
edit: lmao 2 minutes after posting this my transaction got confirmed, I guess randomly complaining works sometimes

Do you think my remaining balance should also get fixed once this transaction goes through? I think I tried everything on my end, from repairing the wallet numerous time to installing it in another computer and my entire remaining balance has been stuck since I made this payment.

Yeah honestly I just learned about fees today, I used to think that they were a fixed value required for every transaction so I didn't bother with it, once this transaction gets confirmed and my remaining balance goes back to normal I'll look more into it.

Yeah, I got it before the 24h mark and today I switched wallets and today I did another transaction which took less than 1 hours
