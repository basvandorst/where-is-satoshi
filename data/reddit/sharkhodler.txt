I know... I'm in tech as well and remote support is a fairly common procedure for MSP's troubleshoot desktops etc., but never should have fallen for this. Like I said, lesson learned that has me hyper-aware of scammy shit going forward. Still pissed at myself

100% scam. I fell for it unfortunately. They’ll remote access your desktop/account (once you manually connect to them) using screen connect service provider and a black screen comes up that says and shows “screenconnectsupport”. From there you’ll lose controls while they “resync you to the servers” and once you lose controls of your desktop it’s game over. Only way to defeat this situation if you find yourself here is to disconnect your computer from the network. Learned a valuable lesson on this scam, and luckily for me I had nearly all of my holdings in a hardware wallet. Hardware wallet saved my ass here. Don’t fall this scam please. This post should be upvoted more with so many noobs coming into the space!

Folks who believe in BTC should also appreciate the test of time precious metals like gold have withstood for centuries as a currency.
