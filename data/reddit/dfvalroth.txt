I think this is a smart move by Amazon, bitcoin isn't widespread enough to warrant integration for them. No point lobbying and petitioning them, let the market speak for itself.

1. Buy 0.000001 bitcoin.
2. Wait 5 years.
3. Purchase boat.

Bitcoin is a simple and robust platform on it's way to being well-recognized. Most altcoins are irrelevant since they add nothing to the bitcoin technology. Since anyone can create an altcoin on their home PC, referencing the gross number of altcoins and saying "Ah, look how cumbersome all these crypto-currencies are!" is a little absurd.

Oh you poor thing, being exposed to propaganda and treated like an ATM! How awful it must be.
Meanwhile in Ukraine...

I'm Australian and I checked out CoinJar briefly. A lot of people on this reddit believe it's founder, Zhou Tong is a known scammer. I've got an account but never used it. I buy my coins through localbitcoins.com, I haven't had any trouble so far with about 15 transactions, make sure to use sellers with a lot of positive feedback. For greatest security, withdraw your coins to paper wallets or some other form of cold storage you control yourself. I hope your money shows up.

Crackpot. Seems like TEDx is to TED what astrology is to astronomy.

Trying to make life fair is a fool's errand. Chance is what gave you life, and chance governs your fate every moment of your life. Fairness is a superstition. It doesn't matter how well known an alt coin is before it releases, you can't reach 100% of the population. Of those who know about it not everyone will have the means to mine or invest in it. Of those who have the means, not all will take it seriously or appreciate it. You're only fooling yourself by being stubborn about bitcoin. Take the opportunities you're given, don't grow old and bitter waiting for a fair go.

If your wallet was hacked and someone took your coins, even if you can trace where the coins were sent, you'd only have an address. In order to actually get your coins back you would need much more information. Unless there is something more that you know about the hacker, getting your coins back is as feasible as attempting to hack any random bitcoin address.

A quaint PDF full of word salad doesn't decide what Bitcoin is, the market will decide.

Money is something I use every day to buy coffee and burritos. I don't see that happening directly with Bitcoin on the blockchain due to scalability, transaction fees and long waits for confirmation. However, if I hold the majority of my wealth on the blockchain and transfer my daily or weekly 'money' to a third party fiat bank or perhaps a Bitcoin bank that doesn't transact directly on the blockchain, then sure, now I have money. Bitcoin is the backbone store of value, while a fiat bank or other third party provide me with the functionality of 'money', so they are separate in that scenario.

Buying drugs online does nothing for the coin or the community either. This insistance on using bitcoin as a currency is ideology. It makes practically no difference what people do with bitcoin so long as they want it. If people want it as a saving account, an investment, a way to pay for illegal shit, a way to hide wealth, a fuck you to fiat and banks, whatever, any angle is a good angle.

Nothing ugly about it, all the infrastructure for fiat payments is everywhere. All these people trying to change the world with something they don't even need are just ideologues. "Oh but what about the 3rd world?", yea whatever you know they have far worse problems than anything internet money can solve. Use the fiat system for what it's good for, and use bitcoin for what it's good for, if you figure out what that is. Deal with reality not ideology.

BTC also has better fundamentals, not premined, limited supply, unlike ETH.
