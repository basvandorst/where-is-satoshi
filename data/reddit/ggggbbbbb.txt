I don’t want to take attention away from Lighthouse, which looks exciting, but Mike’s projects including all his statements MUST be scrutinized in light of his position and the weight he has in the bitcoin community. 
Here is a direct link to the thread on the BF forum and a follow up discussion on reddit.

Sorry, was not meant as an endorsement. For what it's worth, I have traded on btc-central since 2012 without any issues, though I have read the bitcointalk threads about people losing money.

Shame. So much potential there.

Thanks for sharing, very much appreciated. Interesting bit I haven’t seen before: 


resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like.
It's sent directly when it connects. The recipient doubleclicks
on the transaction to see the full message. If someone famous is
getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to
have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and
give out the IP address on their website. "Send X bitcoins to my
priority hotline at this IP and I'll read the message personally."
[From here]( 
It's possible to send bitcoins to an IP address. This could facilitate adoption of tipping on the web if incorporated in the comment section for example.

Please correct me, but I guess they would have to split them over many different addresses before they would sell them, but they're still here:

Ignore the haters dude; this just lightened up my morning a little, so thanks!
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:25:47
Ah, good to know!

Sorry if this has been poster already, but I found this video quite good. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:17:55
Huh, Is anyone else seeing this public note on blockchain?
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:14:45
Thanks for this. Mike went down a slippery slope here, just by the way he introduced and framed the discussion on the arguably contentious topic of bitcoin fungibility. I hope he has come forward with a clear statement since.

Has anyone actually ever used the 'request payment' option in blockchain? It might just work, it's the FBI after all...

Bitcoin-central/Paymium have been trying to issue individual IBAN accounts to customers for a while. They have come close, from their website:

Great talk by Andreas once again. Thanks for sharing.

I found this a strong rebuttal to Mike's proposal to discuss the issue and for the BF to draft a policy. From Peter Todd:

Shit's getting weird. I wonder where this message comes from...

Please excuse the newbie question, but does BitcoinWisdom show support lines? I've always wondered where I could find existing buying/selling orders in these kind of charts.
