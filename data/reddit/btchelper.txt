Cool! Something like taskrabbit.com?
This is a really good suggestion.

I would definitely be interested in this as well. Getting into the market was a little difficult at first. I have been buying through gocelery.com and it seems they figured this one out.
Let me know if I missed the point.

Thanks for the reply! Could you give more details? I am not familiar with all the bitcoin services and I am looking for tips on entry points to help out.
- Are you saying that we should have a bitcoin version of paypal? It seems like bitcoin is secure enough, since we do not need to protect wallet addresses like credit card info or bank account numbers.
- I have only played with (1) purchase exchanges, (2) trading platforms e.g. bitrex, and (3) casinos. What other websites or apps suck? 
What can I build for you!?

I own some bitcoin but do not use it for payments enough and do not mine it.
I know there are wallets, exchanges, trading platforms, educational sites, casinos, and online communities.
Can you think of anything that is on the web that bitcoin doesn't have?

Haha! Maybe you should beg for tips in gone wild

Good point... keep circulating the currency rather than treating it as an extra step in accounting

I am curious as to why bitpay will not work for your solution. It has a free plan with an unlimited processing volume.
Does it need to be opensource? Is that the only difference? 
Did I miss something?

Good suggestion!
@_date: 2014-11-25 12:29:37
Like this one? 
Or did you have something else in mind?

This is a good idea. I would not be surprised if it was shut down for legal reasons though.
I want to think about it but just to make sure that I have the idea,
(1) User suggests that the service downloads a torrent in the background.
(2) User deposits bitcoin to their account.
(3) Users uses bitcoins to quickly and easily buy/download the file from the service.

Hey I am a professional web developer that is in a similar position. I am interested in startups or doing some free/cheap programming for the bitcoin community.
Let me know if you find anything, or need a technical person to help out on a project!

Simple, light weight, and has the potential to make a huge impact. This is exactly what I was looking for
