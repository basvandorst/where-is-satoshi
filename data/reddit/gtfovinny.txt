Do I need a compatible wallet to pay for merchants that are already using LN?

At 7:30 PM is my turn

UPDATE: When I was trying to transfer, there was 270k unconfirmed transactions, now that there is 177k, the fee’s price dropped to $520.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:14:24
It’s still pretty expensive for me 
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:19:25
My mother told me to sell when it was at $3.5k, so glad I never took her too serious.

I’m trying to transfer 6.5 BTC, I don’t know if that’s considered large. But I think the problem is because I have received many payments from different addresses to the same address, and it generated a large number of “inputs”, that might be the reason for the high fee. :(

I guess they won't help me.

I mean all bitcoin I have I got from a website that I coded myself, where bitcoin is the only payment method accepted. :)
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:38:22
I own 4, I can't believe I made all of this just with my coding skills.

What is this app? 
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:24:29
Those fuckers suspended my page haha fuck them. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:42:37
Yes, thanks , you're right, that's the maximum, but it's a weird value, it could be maybe 1 BCH, I had to make 5 transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:35:01
I’m sad because I sold mine for $600 a few days ago... :/ 
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:47:15
I know they aren't exchange, but there's the option to exchange the BCH to BTC or ETH there.. I've tried for the last week, the same happens.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:44:54
Ah, I see. I had to make 5 transactions of 0.918895 BCH, it's not them who do the exchange, it's their partner "ShapeShift" .

You’ll need a new computer very soon

If it was on traditional network, the bird would starve to death waiting for the transaction to be confirmed.
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:42:51
It’s just a test 
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:29:51
That’s why I use BTC Pay Server to host my own payment system and receive directly in my wallet, fu*k third parties.

Magic beans
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:32:22
I’ve been using it for months, love it. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:43:46
Probably Testnet..
@_date: 2018-07-31 23:15:57
That’s a expensive bitch
