I think it's because gdax didn't enable direct trade to btc
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:48:22
Yes. No. Hmm maybe
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:29:10
when do you expect the pump to be done?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:47:40
wow that's almost 200 times I'm impressed
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:57:14
I think they want to hold it until Monday and let it fly after
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:53:16
they now got bitcoin cash tho...
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:39:34
Imagine the people that did hold on and lost it all to a hack. That has happened to a lot of people holding bitcoin. So in this sense you were very lucky. There are a lot of "regret" posts such as this: 
But imagine, it's the same thing as having bought apple stock 15 years ago. It's kinda like saying "I regret not having known yesterday's lottery numbers"
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:37:34
it doesn't matter when they enable the sell button but when they do it will be epic
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:35:02
they get dibs on the upswing
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:48:09
click on bch/usd
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:14:49
why? bitcoin gets smaller when people sell etc. people have lost confidence can gain it back.. but it can take a while
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:09:26
So we should be on lookout about a true btc etf/ipo right? Do you have a stop-loss (sell) on your shares? I currently just hodl but I think by Q2 2018 there will be a btc etf. 
Another question, do you know if it's feasible to buy the foreign swedish COINBTC etf? Not sure if it's even possible via IRA and what the extra costs would be. Because it'd be a foreign asset.

have you seen binance.. omg it's like I feel bad even for just signing up without even transfering any coins. I feel as if I betrayed my email address
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:34:20
bitcoin was on thin ice before but they definitely damaged public confidence for personal gain
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:14:31
yeah it gives credibility to btc. governments are treating it like a real commodity etc.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:03:41
I think they are purposely keeping btc sub 18k right now but this weekend they will buy futures betting up and then they will let fly on the exchanges, massive bull incoming
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:26:13
yeah they really screwed themselves with bcash. it made it appear as if bitcoin was collapsing and just confused people. of course they are never admitting that but I heard they are now working on launching bitcoin RUBY. kudos
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:22:48
up 50% from one month ago. nice try

It shows that crypto in general is taking a hit.. confidence has been lost. but that can turn around again with some time
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:04:51
why now that CME comes out? CBO already came out without big effect why is CME different
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:08:08
it already is centralized.. in china. it's a chinese copy cat scam

do I need to declare anything if I don't exchange btc to other cryptos this year?
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:02:44
once ripple crashes bitcoin will fly
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:48:36
yes but when they do enable the sell button people WILL push it
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:25:33
nope it's gonna be a dump fest so I sure hope you can dump it fast
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:18:29
they're artificially propping up bcash
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:38:13
Yes oddly I can only see XRP helping bitcoin at this point as it will crash and burn. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:05:02

@_date: 2017-12-22 14:42:22
I hope scamcoin cash goes below 1k. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:32:07

is someone gonna sue this fraud? it's blatantly misleading
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:09:29
better dump the scamcoin fast. btc 25k today easy
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:34:58
why don't they swap for something else and then buy btc?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:30:37
bitcoin cash is a scam. bitcoin is not

@_date: 2017-12-21 19:22:14
won't the EFT companies have to buy real bitcoins? else how can they offer a stake in them?
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:06:49
No the people using their IRA's and paying the premium currently just don't have any other choice. They could get a direct bitcoin IRA or they could setup a self-directed IRA but both of these options require some crazy hoops to jump and you then you're stuck with very weird IRS filings. That's why they are currently willing to pay the premium. The premium fluctuates though and you could buy in when it's not too high.

@_date: 2017-12-22 13:56:33

@_date: 2017-12-20 13:35:35
you're not getting my point. they disabled the sell button while allowing buy
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:06:16
probably true... I was actually planning on selling on 1/1... so maybe towards the end of january. but then again if it's THIS low people might not sell

talk to you in ~5 hours again mate

how long must we wait
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:10:46

CBO futures up today bc of CME. massive bull incoming
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:53:59
it takes more than just 1-2 days to get the money to your bank so I think people needing Christmas money would have sold much earlier

@_date: 2017-12-22 19:47:40
daytraders usually loose unless you're on the inside somehow. another way to loose is when you have no stop-loss in case of a huge tanking. just fyi
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:06:08
Just in time when Conbase let us down. I say give Goldman a chance.

You do know this is a Chinese exchange right? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:32:54
1. Then you're likely out of luck unless they decide to spoil you.
2. I believe you might get the fork coins if they decide to disburse them.
3. Should be in your wallet then I think. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:39:33
the question is if any exchange will ever support this fork....

I think we are far from the peak before the next correction. I expect it to go to 20k-30k at the very least. just my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:33:24
you've had too much coffee
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:25:48
Yeah that seems fishy. I'm in a similar boat, transfered old 401k to IRA just so I could buy GBTC. It's been a week since they mailed the check to fidelity and still not there. Cost me 12% today, but oh well it's "just money".
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:34:32
I agree that would be the right thing to do. will they have the spine to do this? no. sad everyone's just out for the money. but that's one more reason why bch won't survive
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:54:53
right that's why I'm saying they are artificially propping it up.. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:45:54
Because increasing lanes just increases traffic.

they're working on launching bitcoin RUBY and using your cpu to do it
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:26:50
yes that's why I only use coinbase/gdax
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:35:15
I honestly believe Ver probably already cashed out on his bch last night. this is the highest it'll ever go
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:11:53
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:18:05
lol how can it fall that far once it hits 40-60? because so many btc have been lost. and not everyone can quickly sell etc. btc are on usb drives paper etc. I kinda think that + the hodl mentality is preventing a crash that bad but please educate me.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:14:04
for some reason people think that false advertisement (camouflaging bcash as btc), misleading customers (enabling BUY on bch but not SELL) is not punishable by law just because it's not happening on the stock exchange. no no people, these are rules that apply to any business and I bet lawyers are salivating already 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:04:16
they'll be forced to adopt because that's what majority wants. do you honestly believe non-scammers want anything to do with bcash
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:33:52
if you find it counterproductive to lose your investment (bch) then yes
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:36:07
There's actually a good amount of people who believe he is/was Satoshi. I am one of them
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:46:28
yeah the trading seems really thin on gdax. something's not right imo
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:39:11
that doesn't make false advertisement (claiming to be bitcoin) and misleading customers legal buddy
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:03:02
miners need so little bandwidth
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:05:12
you should also have some bcash if I'm not wrong
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:42:11
bch going down. most crypto traders want nothing to do with it except for a few scammers
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:17:39
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:21:41
oh yeah? is that why they disabled the SELL button for bcash
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:19:41
yeah I don't think taxes are playing a reason here. if anything people hate paying taxes and would wait until jan 1. I've heard people need Christmas money, that part I understand. but at this point they might not see their money until Christmas for buying gifts. I think it's just fud and lost confidence because people are ruining it (bcash scammers)
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:23:30
don't they get these delivered by ringing a bell
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:41:20
lol. bcash is gonna go to 1k today once they actually enable the sell button
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:00:52
Yeah I'm with you. Massive bull approaching. 30k sometime next week
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:09:38
it met resistance at ~$11-12k. that's also close 10k Euros. that's the bottom of the dip imo. I SAID IMO
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:30:18
Don't worry coinbase is the most reputable exchange
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:08:51
you're right about the functions but most traders are only there for the profit
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:09:03
I saw a survey somewhere that stated Asian crypto investors know very little about crypto. It seems to be more of a gambling thing there. On the one hand we should appreciate their investment on the other hand it seems very capricious
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:03:17
I strongly suspect there's a combined effort to drive up bcash but everyone know's it's a scam just look at the founders. it's only a question of time (possibly in a few hours) when the big whales believe the peak is there and they sell off. then the sky will fall. just my opinion though
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:11:50
they won't sell if the price suxx
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:54:55
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:28:12
they pump up the price trying to deceive a good number of people then sell it off at the peak knowing full well it will never go anywhere. as people catch on it goes towards 0. don't need a source if you've been following bch
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:23:09
no that's why some other exchange will become 
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:14:51
it'll be more like a learning experience.. watch it go up and down etc. even if it goes up by 1000% it'll only be $400 :D.. but at least you're not losing retirement money
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:24:59
these are all scamcoin cash shills
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:40:06
no your heart is being pumped by high cortisol levels. that's not a workout
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:21:20
One possible explanation could be that someone is trying to accumulate a lot of bitcoin slowly without spiking the price too much
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:27:36
Took about 7 hours for me last night as they transfer in batches. Go to conbase and see the status "pending there". chill
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:03:44
I agree with you. when I watched the documentary on netflix and they went to interview hal finney, it was like a lightbulb went on in my head. it was probably just me but to me it was clear that he is Satoshi at that moment
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:10:26
bcash is a scamcoin. all you need to do is look at the founders of bcash

@_date: 2017-12-15 03:18:39
yes since it's a fork. but I'm not an expert. everyone that owns bitcoin for that long should have also some bcash. not sure how it works tho

here comes the dump
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:12:23
yes bch is gonna fall like a rock. lucky those that sold already. I think you can transfer to shapeshift and trade there already. in a few hours coinbase opens bcash trade and ppl will dump it

@_date: 2017-12-20 14:29:21
by the end of tonight bch will be in shambles once they actually enable the SELL button
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:56:16
where can you see that someone is selling 1000BTC+ @ $17250
I'm looking at  depth chart but can't see that specific detail
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:30:15
imo this is about what should happen on coinbase so take a multiplier of 2?
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:31:54
* conbase, the same company that exited from blockchain because they didn't want to grant people their keys
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:10:47
I'm genuinely surprised this guy hasn't be sued yet for blatant false advertisement and misleading people
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:52:02
I've heard that fidelity disabled GBTC buys when there are big swings. Maybe it will work again later?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:10:13
bcash is a scamcoin. all you need to do is look at the founders of bcash
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:13:08
I'd say after Christmas.. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:28:37
stop scaring people. you don't know where it's going to go. nobody knows
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:17:57
I think Hal was smart enough to pull it off and he didn't want the publicity and responsibility of being "the founder of bitcoin". if you read his last message it's incredibly dignified, written by a very smart man that even in the face of his own suffering still had control and composure. that to me proves he's satoshi but it's just me
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:01:54
my thoughts exactly
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:35:36
Ok I was thinking of binance. I hadn't heard of CEX. But like you, I would be concerned about submitting things like passport etc. That's why I'm sticking to GDAX/Coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:36:55
it's gonna be a dump fest
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:44:52
why would there be a selloff before taxes? then they actually need to pay those within the next month(s). I'd think people wait until after 12/31 to sell because then they don't owe taxes until 2019
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:34:03
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:44:43
They do but they're based in California, have good communication and are the biggest Exchange here in the US. that's why I said I don't trust anyone but them.

there's an interesting documentary on netflix which makes the point he must have been one of the cypherpunks, a group of pioneers in crypto, about 10 or so in number... I personally believe it's hal finney
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:01:26
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:34:06
even if you buy with coinbase you basically lock in the coin for the price but it won't be official until the direct deposit clears for like a week. for me that worked out well because I bought at 11k and a week later it was worth 16 when it cleared.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:39:52
dump em fast
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:40:04
I think they were trying to crash btc but realized it's not making anyone switch to bch
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:24:25
it's actually way below any of those numbers. sell it fast if you own it's gonna be a dump fest of bch
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:13:28
talk to you in a year looser
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:41:45
lol talk to you in a few hours when they actually enable the SELL button bch is going way down
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:48:33
imagine 6k BCH go into BTC
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:50:12
oh yeah is that why they enabled the BUY button but disabled SELL
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:01:32
just wait until it comes out as a scam. this was bcash's last bullet 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:46:30
sorry we are busy preparing the launch of bitcoin ruby, a better version of bitcoin core
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:31:51
I bought some at 11 and some at 17-18. I'm hodling. I think January or February will look much better but that's just me and everybody makes their own decisions
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:04:00
it wasn't just one guy. just one guy is the face of it. CNBC was on board too (marketing director) to promote scamcoin cash. I agree it's sad bitcoin isn't stronger at this point but that's because a lot of the recent cash was from newcomers who are just there to make profit. and let's be honest most people are in it to make a profit even if they like the technology
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:16:41
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:56:40
if they do that I think there will be legal implications for misleading customers / false advertisement..?
"we'll give you bch but only if you sell it when we tell you!"
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:46:17
go buy some dude
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:59:30
30 seconds
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:36:07
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:48:50
CNBC was on board. it's a chinese copy cat scam that will forever be a pump and dump coin. slow death spiral coming watch and see.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:12:19
this is the kind of stuff that needs to be disabled. if you're gonna put in a buy order you shouldn't be able to cancel it
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:45:06
it'll be a slow death spiral. slow.. but deadly
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:36:35
it's gone
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:08:03
it's 100% a centralized scam. it's basically the opposite of what bitcoin is. have you done any research into the founders of bcash? that should give you enough warning as to what they are planning to do with the money that people are putting into it
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:18:37
You can also say resistance re: selling.. not just buying. goes either way

Just another day in Russia/Ukraine
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:55:53
what does that even mean, post only?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:15:11
oh yeah? how can people sell if the SELL button is disabled.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:26:01
Good thing you’re on the inside 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:41:15
It seems like it dips during noon a lot lately. Anyone else notice that?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:03:43
I don't think taxes the reason.. at all
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:19:14
they destroyed confidence in crypto. will take a year to rebuild and undo their damage
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:54:01
Soon it won't be in top 10 when the scammers take all their money out
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:03:24
sell 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:57:29
better dump it fast
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:03:02
one's a scam, the other one is not
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:24:23
if it's a 401k from prev. employer make it an IRA. if it's your current employer's 401k you can't but you could take a loan. not a good idea
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:32:05
yeah I wonder if it can ever go high again without those newbies abandoning ship...
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:06:35
I keep reading 9am but do you have a source?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:16:42
at the end of today you will understand why it's a scam. hope you don't own any bch you're in for a ride (down)
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:01:33
this was their last bullet. talk to you tonight..
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:59:05
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:52:32
give it at least till the end of january or february mate.. I think new year is gonna be good once we approach february. there might be some sellers on 1/1 because of new tax year tho
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:58:48
maybe they conned everyone and shorted bitcon even though publicly stated the opposite
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:35:11
these are small fish
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:36:37
Mine took about 6 hours. You can log into conbase and get more info there. It’ll likely say pending
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:08:33

people lost confidence because of crooks playing their games
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:05:22
that sums it up. we need minimum account age asap
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:43:56
Will I get fork coin on 12/28?
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:56:48
misleading customers is illegal. enabling buy but disabling sell is illegal. false advertising (bcash as bitcoin) is illegal. all this can very well will lead to time in prison.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:48:05
I don't think so.. look at the USD spread lots of orders at 17560 
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:42:56
yeah ripple is in right now but it won't be for long. that's because it's centralized. eventually people will dump it but that's just my opinion
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:17:42
let me buy you some tinfoil
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:44:39
it's a slow death-spiral for them. wait and see
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:34:43
I think we're meeting resistance.. $10-11k might be the bottom. once people realize, this is the bottom, they might be willing to buy in again
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:22:18
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:05:21
sometimes these walls are fake and disappear. they can be meant to trick people there's a bottom or ceiling. probably bots
