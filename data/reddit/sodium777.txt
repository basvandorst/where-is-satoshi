They didn't have the right connections.
What did Ruper Murdoch call it?
"you scratch my back and i scratch yours"

Currencies are all ultimately based on trust. Trust that you can trade them for something useful.
I think Buffett means that most of the trust in Bitcoin right now is for all the wrong reasons. Rather than exchange bitcoin for services and goods, people are either using it as publicity to make some more moeny that immediately gets converted to fiat, or as a get rich quick scheme.
Bitcoin isn't by design bad and a 'ponzi scheme'. Its the reasons people use it for that has made it similar to one.
The good thing is, good healthy trust can be created by more Bitcoin businesses. Which is happening right now. Bitcoin isn't a particularly good currency now, but it will be in the future.

Dogecoiner here, I like you :3
Don't mistake a few dogecoiners complaints as the overall view of the dogecoin community, infact, most dogecoiners look up to you guys as big bros for blazing the cryptocurrency trail!
I suspect most of the people trashing you guys are disgruntled former bitcoiners who've jumped onto the dogecoin hypetrain for the worst possible reasons.
So please don't judge us harshly. We love you!
