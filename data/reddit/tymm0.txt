Wow I assumed we had more full nodes out there. I should go turn mine back on. Although it's pretty cool we doubled in the last year.

For real though. 4 mb blocks for 1 year requires 2tb. That's 1/2 their limit.

I was thinking more about it yesterday when I saw the post about isle of man.

Is this not the same attack that I saw a post about from eligius?
Doesn't sound like a good idea to me...even though we keep running into this problem. I think people just need to look around a bit more. There are plenty of good pools out there.

Thanks for pointing this out. I had almost forgotten about it. Exciting. I really hope we get things together before then. I could see it going badly just as much as going well these days. Although honestly zero change would be great.

My main issue with the current financial system is at the fundamental level. We have to give other companies and people authorization to take money from our account. This seems like it doesn't matter but the whole idea is backwards. Whoever designed this idea is an idiot. Why should I have to give out my private info to some stranger who at many points in the process could steal my info and steal from me. I don't want to have to trust anyone. It's my money and I am responsible to keep it safe end of story.  
Edit: didn't really answer the question exactly....so I say maybe we will be close to mainstream in 5 years hopefully. Would make me so happy. 
 As far as how...not sure we need better apps that make it easy to use. Make it easier to understand. It's gonna take some time but I think we can do it.

The problem is no one wants to sell on coinbase because of irs.

Never thought about it they way it is explained in the abstract here. But it makes sense. Credit is essentially making money at will. And has probably contributed a great deal to our money issues. However if we didn't have it how would any normal middle or lower class person own a house?

This needs to be voted higher.

Your coins are at risk if you do not have direct control over the private keys. Blockchain.info can decide which side of the split they want to enforce for all their users.
