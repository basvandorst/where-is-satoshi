But is it possible if he has BTC, an update will cause him to lose access? I have the same wallet and an old version, but I'm afraid of losing my holdings if I upgrade... I tried to use the private key on a different wallet but it didn't work.... can you point me in the right direction to update and secure my wallet?

IMHO that we'll see a big hike in prices right out the gate when trading opens up again. If anything, the cooldown is allowing for a greater number of users to become verified and setup with purchasing ability. My guess is we'll all look at the charts come Friday morning and see 'em valued at ~$400/BTC.

Vote this up, I'm tired of making accounts for all of these websites only to be disappointed.

They ripped me off as well. And EVEN THOUGH I've posted on reddit and contacted their support service they have not made any attempt to sort this out. 
You however got lucky, I made a deposit when the actual values of bitcoins were hovering around $80, BitInstant however saw the votility of the market and thought I wouldn't notice if they charged me a ridiculous exchange rate of $130/BTC. Well I noticed! And I would not recommend their service to anyone looking to get into bitcoins

You can start by realizing you're way to late to consider mining if you don't have a super computer at hand.

I used BitInstant on Friday April 12th and have had a mixed response to their services. Although I was very pleased to have actually received BitCoins for the money I paid, I was shocked to see that I my transaction was conducted using an egregiously high conversion rate relative to what market prices were shown on exchange sites like MtGox and BTC-e. I paid $203.95, $3.95 went as the ZipZap fee, and $192.02 were credited to my account. Where did $7.98 go?! It was just lost like that. 
The ~$8 isn't what made me feel swindled. What really disappointed me was when I looked at my balance in my wallet, I only saw 1.46916716 BTC, meaning I paid about $130 per BTC. Mind you the market value had dropped sub $100 at the time I placed my order! I'm thinking to myself, wow BitInstant just made a killing off me. They just pocketed so much of my money...
Thankfully this was a test of their system for me and my small business and the $200 I invested was a small fraction of what I plan on investing in bitcoins. If this can be rectified my faith in BitInstant will be renewed and I will continue to use your service however at the moment I'm looking into other competing services that will actually honor business ethics.
