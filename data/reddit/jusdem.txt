"Bitcoin Unlimited has been thoroughly rejected by the community"
...which community exactly? That's right, we're all divided these days (not good). This type of bashing needs to STOP!

Correct. The longest chain cannot break the rules. Unless the rules are changed as part of the planned fork.
I mean, why does any of this matter? We should be discussing how we as a community can come together to solve this. Not discussing something that someone else has already identified. It just gets messy then.

It's interesting how people talk about side chains and such, as if it's the only solution to this political blocksize debate.
Technology shouldn't be used to work around politics, it should be used to solve problems. 1mb blocks is the problem, not that people disagree on a fork.
So glad I sold most of my BTC holdings, this debate is so toxic and is at the point where people just can't agree on anything and Bitcoin will be forced into some political agenda.
This is not what Satoshi envisioned, and definately not the conversation this community would be having just a few years ago. Bitcoin is absolutely not working perfectly tly fine - blocks are full! Haha what a joke.

Don't listen to him, as long as you have your private key (wallet) then you control your Bitcoin.
But if the internet goes down, miners would drop off and Bitcoin transactions would grind to an extremely slow pace (far worse than the backlog we have today), people would panic, the price would crash, and you would be lucky to get online and sell your coins in time.
This is why it's a problem that China does most of the mining, if they go offline or the Chinese government decides to block it with the great firewall then the rest of the Bitcoin world will suffer big-time. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 22:54:27
I don't get it - SegWit introduces the centralization of bitcoins. If SegWit has issues, then Bitcoin has even bigger issues.
Just make the blocks bigger, it's pretty simple, and is what Satoshi said we would do. A 1mb block was a temporary solution at the time; it's no longer needed.

Correct, eventually the difficulty would adjust and Bitcoin would adapt, but it could take quite a bit until that happens, depending on how bad the outage was. Either way, it would eventually fix itself.
@_date: 2017-01-25 23:48:15
LOL you cannot increase the BITCOIN block size without a hard fork - what don't you understand about that? A blocksize increase is a direct change to the protocol, and as such requires a hard fork.
If this was not the case then we wouldn't be debating over a simple block size increase. I mean the name "Segregated Witness" says it all!
Let's look at the definition of Segregated - set apart from the rest or from each other; isolate or divide.
Bottom line, these are not BITCOIN block sizes. To do that, you need a hard fork; not sure why we're arguing this?
@_date: 2017-01-04 16:11:00
@_date: 2017-01-25 23:24:53
So somehow SegWit has been able to increase block size without a hard fork then I suppose? That's impossible, hence why we need a to fork for bigger blocks.
The block size LIMIT is still 1MB. Accounting tricks can't change that.
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:32:52
Bitcoin has always been considered digital "gold" as it carries similar properties. Litecoin for example has been considered digital "silver" to Bitcoin gold, again because it's properties.
Ethereum is considered digital oil because "Ether" (the token of value) is used to pay to run/access distributed applications that are developed on the Ethereum platform/blockchain by means of what's called "gas". So because of this it carries similar properties to that of oil, and because Ethereum is building a truly decentralized web (web 3.0) that anybody can create distributed applications (known as Dapps) on top of using its native turing-complete programming language called "Solidity" - this makes it all possible in Ethereum.
Many people see Ethereum as the future of smart contracts and web 3.0 considering Ethereum is light years ahead of any other group (not to mention  market cap) in this respect (even Rootstock uses the Ethereum-based 'Solidity' - that speaks volumes to the Ethereum project). If building blockchain apps on distributed ledgers is the future (clearly it is, 2016 was the year of smart contracts) then Ethereum is the platform of choice, and paying to run them with Ether makes Ether like digital oil.
Bitcoin simply isn't capable of doing these things, thus it is more like "gold".
If you believe in web 3.0 then stocking up on digital "oil" isn't a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-01-28 20:34:57
Could be, yes. But this would take months to achieve.
Hopefully Bitcoin would cycle through the 2016 blocks it needs to recalculate difficulty sooner than that.
Either way it won't be fun for anybody.
@_date: 2017-01-03 16:20:33
Ethereum will likely be getting the Raiden Network sidechain implemented in 2017 - at least there will be significant milestones reached.
What is it trying to solve? It's trying to create a platform upon which smart contracts or Dapps can be developed. What problems will those contracts/dapps solve will be seen over time. What we do know however, os that s,art contracts is extremely promising and has been since the 90's - Ethereum will now be able to take us there, and we shall see what fruits it bears, and I imagine there will be a lot.

No it would take longer that that. If say the miners dropped by 50% right after the difficulty adjustment, it would take roughly 50% longer to reach the next difficulty adjustment and this is painful for everybody.
This is what I mean by it would slow to a crawl, and would be a painful time for bitcoin to get through that initial period. It's likely during this time that miners would continue to drop off as the profitability would drop as well (can't mine blocks as fast), nevermind the price dropping would accelerate that further.
Essentially in this example, we would see bitcoins 10min block interval go up to about 15min interval or higher. This would have a direct impact on the time it would take to readjust, as bitcoin difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks. You can do the math...
This has happenned to many altcoins in the past where mining pools would jump on a coin because it's profitable and easy to mine, hashrate climbs fast, next difficulty adjustment would go high, then the pools drop off because profitability drops again (it's harder to mine), and the coin struggles to get through that period until the next time difficulty adjusts. Usually (depending on the algo) this can continue for a bit (high, low, high, low).

"Lightning network alpha was recently released...After SegWit, it can be used in the main network right away!"
No, let's not use an alpha solutions in a production environment. Please don't suggest that, it's not this simple and you know that.
"A solution that does not danger the decentralized and censorship-free nature of Bitcoin"
False, SegWit does in fact introduce some level of centralization in terms of where bitcoins reside - having bitcoins "locked up" in a SegWit environment is one thing, but when that environment has issues, we have big problems for Bitcoin, and believe me we will have issues with SegWit.
Bitcoin is 8yrs old, SegWit isn't even a year old and you want to tie the two together and make them co-dependent?
IMO that seems too risky for a $16B market, when you could just do what Sotoshi envisioned; simply increase the block size and the risk is FAR less than experimenting with SegWit on the Bitcoin network.
Keep it simple

Yes that could be theoretically possible, but unlikely. People like Bitcoin too much to just let it die like that, although if the outage was severe enough it could happen.
Bitcoin has been designed to recalculate every 2016 blocks. They could .And it recalcate every block, but that would require a hard fork and I'm not sure of the other implications with that would be - I'll let someone else with more technical background on the subject answer that.

Just because it has the most hashrate doesn't necessarily mean it's the most secure. Some would argue that the chain that expends the most economic resources to manage and protect it, is therefore the most secure chain.
If Bitcoin was worth nothing, yet had the most hashrate... It would cost me nothing to attack it. If however bitcoin expended trillions of dollars a day to secure it, then it would cost me quite a bit to attack it, thus making it more secure.
Hashrate is not the important factor in this context.

I'm not sure what the benefits are? Satoshi would have removed it himself by now.

Instead of being a troll, how about you educate the community then instead of throwing rocks. You're not helping the situation.

The debate is one thing. The limitation is another, and it requires discussions. You cant ignore it.

Understand what it takes to implement SegWit, then help the community get there. We do need SegWit, but it takes months of dev effort to implement. It's not easy friend.

Any chance to attack the other side, and folks will take it. We need to learn to work together, otherwise this community is doomed.

Don't be cynical. I can agree with you, but I can also see it as a feature to deactivate stolen miners or to handle/ensure failover between datacenters.... I can think of many different uses, both good and bad, but people here seem to be leaning towards the negative way too much these days. Which is another reason why I don't spend much time in this community.
@_date: 2017-04-28 00:12:25
Right, so let's not discuss the pros and cons of this new revelation. Let's not have a healthy debate at all, and instead we'll blindly take your advice because we're all just lemmings in this game we call Bitcoin.
Move on folks, nothing to see here.

It's a technical issue that stems from an artificial limitation that no longer needs to be there. Let's work towards solving this technical issue. It's not a political debate, at least it shouldn't be.
@_date: 2017-04-01 13:30:32
Agreed. Let's the pros discuss it. Let them solve this technical issue.

So, NEM or ETH-based, we don't know. There have been mixed signals.

How about the Hong Kong agreement. Do you remember what that was all about?

Welcome to crypto my friend. It's the beginning of a new paradigm.
No guarantees though, but there's lots of great ppl here.

Someone here will likely just donate you the missing amount, since you're new to the game, and we all welcome newbies with open arms.
Please post your public wallet address so that someone can send you some.
Note: I don't have BTC but if I did I would absolutely send you the amount you need.

This is a good response, thank you for taking the time to explain this to me. I've learnt something new today!
Thank you �� I get it now.

Please give me a reason why Turing complete languages is no good for smart contracts... I'm curious what the biggest reason might be.

You must be new. All good.

How about we focus on resolving the block size limitation, rather than pointing fingers at each other.
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:40:56
That's because of inflation actually. Nothing to do with caps.

Actually, a blockchain is the name of what makes up the bitcoin ledger; correct. However without a blockchain you cannot have Bitcoin for example. So Bitcoin is technically based off of blockchain technology, as are many other currencies, and now startups are looking at other ways to use the blockchain like asset tracking.
If you still disagree or don't understand, let's look at the definition of technology:
"the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry."
The scientific knowledge in blockchains is what Satoshi created. Read more on this technology in his whitepaper here - it clearly demonstrates innovation in technology, in what he/she dubs the "blockchain": 
So whether we use blockchains, or "ledgers" as they are traditionally called, for bitcoin or etherium or Ripple or whatever... It's how we APPLY the technology to CREATE something like bitcoin. Bitcoin is only one example of the application of blockchain technology, and is not the technology itself - hence the need for the name "blockchain"; bitcoin and blockchains are two different entities and cannot be compared, as one is based on the other.
To me, a blockchain in it's simplest form is a way of keeping track of and proving ownership of a digital token/asset. That token or asset can be anything you want, whether its a house, vehicle, stock, or bitcoin for that matter. Blockchain technology finally allows us to be able to do this in an extremely efficient, secure, and decentralized manner. Definately the first of it's kind, and in my opinion, Bitcoin is probably one of the more basic use cases for blockchain technology.

Bitfinex cannot process any fiat deposits or withdrawals, so the only option is to withdrawal crypto. People are panicking that they may never get their fiat out of Bitfinex, so they buy up BTC or ETH, transfer it to another exchange like Coinbase to sell.
This is why Bitfinex is so much higher than all other exchanges (lots of buying, not much selling). Just be careful, this is not healthy for the price long term.

Going to Toronto? Head over to Decentral, located downtown - they have an ATM there where you can withdrawl.

Interesting how times change things.

Well back then when vendors started accepting Bitcoin, it was great for the community, the project, and the market. Nowadays were moving backwards, undoing all that great groundwork.

I understand that, but what "bug" was introduced with the hard fork?
The use of a split contract is the solution, not a bug. Lack of replay protection was intended as well, at the time of the fork, so that was not a bug either - at least we cannot claim as such.
Just confused about OPs connection - seems trollish, particularly because we're talking about this in the r/Bitcoin sub. Just trying to understand is all...
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:31:53
And what does this have to do with a previous hard fork, which one and how is this related?
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:34:10
There is a lot more to it than just what you had described. It's important to understand the technology before commenting on it.
