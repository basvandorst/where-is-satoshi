You're gonna pay transfer fees if you transfer from a wallet to coinbase or any other exchange.

Yeah do not trust anyone. That string of words is a seed that will always generate the wallet, it’s the actual thing that gives access to your bitcoin. That it like a key to your bank account and anyone that has it can do whatever they want.
Check if there are other apps in the drive, like the ethereum app or litecoin, you could possibly have much more than just 1500. Check literally everything.

I just don't get how you can have like 30 altcoin wallets on the device and recover it all with a pass phrase that you set up before you had any money on the device.

He's just delusional if he thinks a blockchain will replace fiat in 15 years. Something will come along, yes, but you can bet your ass governments won't let people get away with unregulated currencies that easily.

I mean 1000 words would already yield an insane ammount of possible combinations judging by the combinations formula. Can't wrap my mind around 26^4 words, so I feel like there's nothing to worry about. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:00:47
100 satoshi = 100$ and $100 then will be 0.001$ now

Okay, that ideally is the case. But go read about tether, read about who owns and who "prints" it. Read about how it's pumping Bitcoin.
Shits fucked, get your ass ready. I don't think it's gonna go down soon though.

1. Bitstamp starts getting withdrawal orders
2. Can't pay them all
3. Sells Bitcoin to get money to pay the withdrawals
4. Supply keeps increasing
5. Price goes down
6. Market turns bear.

You know, your not wanting to pay for other cities mentality is  one of the reasons health Care is so expensive in the us and why people spend so much more on health care in the us than in many European countries, even accounting for healthcare related taxes.

My mother calls it bitcoina because coina is Portuguese slang for pussy.

Should have bought when it dipped from 11k to 9k again, not it's back at almost 11k again. Wait for the next dip
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:57:21
This topic is really interesting to me, thanks! This now will be a more technical question but does the ledger nano have an entire English dictionary on it to be able to generate unique seeds? It gives you 24 random words that generate a seed, would be weird if they had only like 100 words on it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:03:53
yes because 1000 other people won't be needing the money at the same time. More people contributing -&gt; less money you'll spend when you need it to and less money you'll have to spend. You could argue that when you're contributing money you're also spending but after summing everything up you end up spending less if you do contribute.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:51:04
Oh. I see, the address generator is deterministic. So what's to guarantee some users won't get the same recovery seed by pure bad luck? Or is it so impossible to get the same seed kind of like where when you shuffle a deck of cards you'll most likely get a new combination?

Tell them you sold out at 1000 and used the 10k dollars you got to pay the debts. Bam.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:47:25
That's crazy and Bitcoin will crash like it happened in the past and go up slowly again. 
Don't be delusional.

You have money now, so you don't have to worry about your kids finding jobs that are safer money makers.

I have invested a lot of money on LTC, I already knew that ;)
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:22:20
Gdax is owned by coinbase but is a more advanced platform. Buying on coinbase is the simplest way you can get criptocurrency, but you pay higher fees for that. 
If you want to learn I recommend you just experiment yourself. Deposit $5 to coinbase through your bank account (if you're from europe you can make a SEPA transfer, not sure how it works for the US) and on gdax transfer the funds from your coinbase account and try buying something with that.
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:05:17
Go to gdax.com using Google chrome, open the menu and tap "add to home screen"
You'll have now an instant GDAX "app"

Don't tell me you let exchanges hold for you.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:52:48
That would be an amazing return however you look at it. Invest 5000 come out with 10000 not bad at all.
Just saying what I said above made me uneasy, this all does seem like a scam but I'm cautiously optimistic. Just bought a little more lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:34:29
I like to know the opinions of different people, and me ~~knowing~~ having the opinion that LTC is better than BCH doesn't mean I knew it was that undervalued.

What's the difference between gdax and kraken?
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:50:20
Ah ok. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:26:02
Does coinbase have a flat tax or does it scale with the ammount you sell?
