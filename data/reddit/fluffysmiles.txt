This has always been the case. From the earliest days of the internet, the potential for the sharing of world changing ideas has been overshadowed by the siren calls of meaningless gossip.
Gossip is easy, fun and results in a feedback loop that panders to the base triggers in the human brain.
Thought and work is not easy and reasoned argument or discussion requires effort.
People are lazy and we're hard wired to stimulate those pleasure centres, it seems to me.
That's why CryptoKitties and not CryptoKnowledge.

Entrenched professions with vested interests in the status quo never admit that they need to plan for fundamental change.
I learned this lesson way back in the 1980s when typesetting was a highly regarded and lucrative profession and I was creating systems that would end up destroying their job security. 
A useful experience when young and one which has informed much of my thinking ever since.

Ah, time travel.
The eternal human dream.
Live today and use your current knowledge to the best of your ability. If the world changes tomorrow, your consolation is that you made the best decision at the time.
Regret is pointless.

I suggest Mr McAfee invest in a grammar checker. It might make his reality easier to comprehend.

I'm just amazed that anyone's amazed. I mean, it's not as if people weren't saying "don't forget, it is possible for it to drop to zero. Only spend what you can afford to lose" and so-on.
Bitcoin is faith that a future with a specific vision will come to pass. I share that faith, but I never expected the journey to be anything other than what I have seen so far.
Some people asked me to help them invest in cryptocurrencies, and I politely refused. There is no assistance or advice  that anyone can give that will be anything more than speculation based on untested assumptions and faith.
That's the thing about creating something that has never existed before. It's inherently unpredictable.

Silly stuff. I think it shows how little people understand about what they're actually buying.

Digital services is where it's going to grow fastest I think. And digital services will eventually run everything.
It's a natural home.

Bitcoin could only be defeated if every node everywhere was taken offline and every ISP everywhere was forced to block communication with the network.
Not gonna happen.
And the value of Bitcoin is not in terms of fiat currency. It's in terms of how it can be used to fuel an economy that is still in development.
Eventually digital services will run absolutely every aspect of day to day life. Cryptos are the only really economically rational solution to easy, seamless, fast and efficient transfer of value between consumer and producer in a digital economy.
Short term thinking fuels fear.

Because it's next year at the earliest that anything's going to happen, not exactly unexpected and requires lots of adoption before it's meaningful.
Yes, it's full of potential but it's not really breaking news.

The guy holding the apple looks unhappy. He's just realised he's grabbed a round blob from an alt-tree that required zero proof of work except an ability to climb a tree.
The guy chopping down the tree has abandoned his shop to concentrate on destroying a worthless supply of fake apple clones.

The "market", in its current form, is a sideshow.
You'll see.

Look at it as if it were the cost of a course at the University of Life.
Your life isn't ruined. You've grown as a person. Don't let one summer define you in the negative. 
Trust me, in later years you'll look back and thank whatever God you believe in that it wasn't worse and that you learned from the experience.
And then you'll raise a glass and laugh about it in the company of friends.
Because BC will be at 10,000+ :-)

Buy when you feel comfortable.
Educate yourself about what you're buying into. This isn't Forex.

You do know that feeding trolls means more come begging, don't you? Every response is just blood in the water.
Those you wish to protect from silliness should be able to differentiate it from seriousness. If they can't then they kinda deserve to get a painful lesson imo.
Peace bro.

Colliding neutron stars are cool miners. Way more so than banks of computers in a warehouse close to cheap electricity. So pfft to your lack of appreciation of cool stuff.
I like shiny things :-)

Everything is a gamble, it's just a matter of degree and risk.
Getting married? Gamble.
Leaving a job? Gamble.
Starting a business? Gamble.
Driving? Gamble.
Eating in a restaurant? Gamble.
To think you have any control over the world around you is a ridiculous idea.
The only thing I have seen in this world that is not a gamble is the immutability of the Bitcoin blockchain over time. It's the only thing you can be sure will not change over time. It's the only thing that is resistant to censure or political control.
Embrace the chaos and watch for opportunity.

Judging by the reports about Trump's taxes, that limit seems to be extremely fucking high.

twitter handle + reddit username == potentially useful set information, esp when coupled with compromised datasets from other services.
