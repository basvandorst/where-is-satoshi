Very interesting points. Tipping is about promoting Bitcoin. The tip widgets will evolve. 
But I dont think you give Panhandlers any credit. They are much too smart to have a cup full of twenties, there is actually a course you can take on the art of panhandling. Dont think there are any student loan programs supporting them tho :-)

Hello Redditors,
Looking for feedback on a new way to introduce the service industry to Bitcoin and have them . 
Introducing Bitcoin to waiters, waitresses, bartenders, car mechanics, car detailers, gardeners, boat detailers, home renovators, house painters, baby-sitters and the endless number of service groups will help grow awareness. Many of these service sectors currently have no easy format to acknowledge exceptional performance. 
Here is the intro TipMeWithBTC.blogspot.ca
Comments are appreciated.
Share with your car mechanic and see what they think?
Thank you.

That is already incorporated. It would be great if the sender had the option of donating any rejected Tips or unclaimed Tips to a charity or have them evenly distributed to a list of charities.

too small?, Ok then, I dont believe that 100 bit @_date: 2014-11-24 15:41:24
No, I dont believe that 1 bit! @_date: 2014-11-23 22:44:02
Thanks for the nice comment.  I know what you are saying.  The conversation is tough to have with someone who is working a busy shift, especially restaurant environ.
We are having business size cards made to leave with waiters, waitresses, bartenders, car mechanics, car jockeys, electricians and basically anybody that does a job that could be tipped.  These cards will have simple description on how to set up twitter and the potential that exists accepting Bitcoin tips.  This can also lead to potential Merchant accepting Bitcoin if the staff are all having a ball with it.
Thank you again.

* 1) His rider will TipHimWithBitcoin
* 2) Give him 5 stars because he did a great job
* 3) In the comment box note that they tipped him with bitcon.
* 4) The drivers rating will skyrocket
* 5) The driver will enjoy his additional income, bump the bitcoin economy, tell his fellow drivers about bitcoin and downvote you on reddit.

Thanks Bruce..great ideas..... 
And it's Satoshi's not cents... you of all peeps should know better. . ;-
Because of you.. the card will be a redesign with no uber logo and a softsell theme. 
How about:
"I feel the love from Uber, but I want the love from Satoshi"

Excellent points. Uber drivers are allowed to display the Uber logo without fear of trademark violation. The Uber Driving community wants tipping and bitcoin is the perfect vehicle (pardon the pun) . If Uber wants to sue me they'll start with a cease &amp; desist. Until then, we can (respectfully) approach this the same way Uber approaches everything. With wanton disregard for the rules.

Too cool... luv it. Good catch Sherlock ... Well send this off to  if we can remember the wallet password...
@_date: 2015-07-22 18:23:09
Lol! Really? I tell you what. If a single satoshi gets sent to that address I'll send it to Connie Gallippi at  ... ok Sherlock?

Nobody mentioned pressuring anyone into giving a tip. I see uber drivers posting notes in their cars saying "Gratuities Accepted" The card gets exposed the same way a QR code with a bitcoin logo on it does. 
Magic Money? Where do you see that on the card?
