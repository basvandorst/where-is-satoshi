Plethora of interviews, media coverage and writings going back to 1980 and I caddied for him at a trump golf course. The guys great. Unfairly treated in media because he is ruling global establishments plan for world government.

Yea it's a simple market cap equation. Gold commands a $1153 price because $7 trillion is invested in the total tonnage which, is in the billions. Correct me if I'm wrong but it is significantly higher than bitcoin. 
Only 21 million bitcoins will be created. Divide $7 trillion by 21 million and you get it equaled out.

How come new addresses are beneficial? Just curious, I didn't know that. I don't reuse and am wondering if that's a reason why I've never had problems.
