Which, of course, you are. Having worked in the restaurant industry, chargebacks even for stupid $40 meals were really stinking common. Signatures required on all purchases regardless of ticket amount.
I also know a guy who sold BTC online in the early days and accepted CCs, and it ended up eating the majority of his profits, several thousand dollars worth of fraud. It's really common because credit cards are a really broken system.

I don't know where you live, but I have several options for buying lunch in Portland that accept payment in Bitcoin. Just because we're on the leading edge of the adoption of a new form of currency doesn't mean it isn't one, it just means it lacks the traction that fiat has. Which is an absurd comparison, of course the fiat of a SOVEREIGN STATE has traction, because you pay your taxes in it, and you transact in it, or they shoot you.
At the end of the day, if the last Bitcoin will be mined in 2140, I feel that we will see far, far greater penetration into the global economy by Bitcoin long before then. And if not, well then I am willing to bet that last BTC will never be mined because this specific cryptocurrency will have been superseded by a new one that addresses issues to be found in this one.
But don't think for a minute that the world will escape from this experiment without seeing a revolution in the way payments are processed, and currencies controlled. Everyone is watching: Visa, Paypal, and the governments of Super Powers. Regardless of where Bitcoin itself ends up, the allure of a public ledger with minimal instantaneous transactions will effect all other forms of payment processing. And most likely take some smaller victims as prizes along the way (Wells Fargo, Paypall).
It's not going to be an overnight change, but the cat is out of the bag, and the software is Open Source. It can't be bought up and excluded from the market, and it can't fail to adapt. If there's demand, someone will improve it to address the needs of those who demand it. Even if that ends up in pre-mined AmexCoin and DiscoverCoin managed blockchains.

Exactly, Bitcoin is like Internet Cash. You choose the level of risk you're comfortable with. Eventually systems will be built around it that provide risk minimizing features, but you'll pay for those. Luckily, they'll always be optional. So you may use your insurance/charge-back enabled payment processor on a purchase from a shady online store with no history, but with a trusted retailer (be that Amazon, NewEgg, or Walmart) you can assume some of the risk yourself, and use your personal wallet: avoiding any surcharges that the risk minimizer assesses.

Or, like in the Kryptoradio project, we'll see a terrestrial broadcast of the blockchain, and subscribers to that broadcast can attach their DVB/ShortWave/FM Tuner to their PC and grab the dataset OTA. It'll only be as up-to-date as the most recent block perhaps, but it'll provide a synchronization system that's available globally without the cost of a fast Internet connection: blockchain broadcasts can be one direction, purchases (much smaller) can be sent over a GPRS connection. Sure you'll have to wait 10 minutes to "hear back" if it was included in the block, but it would work for 3rd world transactions. And could be improved upon by a more modernized approach (perhaps a live stream of all transactions at the point where their reference node becomes aware of them? With a "verified block found" broadcast breaking those up when a block is solved.)

Disagree about Bitcoin being ill-suited for micropayments, but do agree at using an alt, preferably one with a lot of traction like Dogecoin. The beauty of it is that it's so worthless, it'd feel like getting paid more (100 Doge/day is only 0.00003500, or about 2 cents USD). And then there are the transaction fees, working in the Doge blockchain is cheaper right now for micropayments (so I guess I am kinda/sorta agreeing that Bitcoin isn't good for micropayments yet then).
Also, Doge is "fun", and with that fun money might come more in-person tipping, and thus increased mindshare. What's good for blockchain technologies is good for all cryptocurrencies, and Doge can be a gateway "low bar" entry point to serious use of Bitcoin in the future.

No, that was the point, Satoshi Dice "you didn't win" transactions are not valid, are spam, and are damaging to the blockchain. That's not an opinion piece, it's a patch to fix a very real problem.
What you shared *is* your opinion however, since you didn't familiarize yourself with the patch, the problem it was trying to solve, or other solutions to the problem. Dusting is a real problem, unspendable transactions are a real problem. Satoshi Dice has been a *bad actor* since 2013:
And the people backing Satoshi Dice then, are the same well-spoken and terribly mannered people who commented on the Gentoo bug for the patch:
Everyone has an agenda. Luke Jr. didn't blacklist any number of even seedier websites with his patch, only the ones that have been causing real spam to the blockchain since March of 2013, and they were asked back -then- to stop running their business in a way that screws up Bitcoin.
So if Luke's agenda is to keep the blockchain secure, then what is the agenda of these extremely vocal advocates of filling the blockchain with gigabytes of worthless data?

Well yes, but you have to consider who was requesting the money. Likely, it was via merchant account from a rental agency or their payment processor. That processor has a business relationship that has lots of "green flags" on lots of regularly occuring large transactions. Suspicion would be raised I believe if it were some random Joe trying to withdraw random sums of money from random accounts, with a high failure rate (since the thief wouldn't know the current account balance).
I'm not saying the system over here is perfecft, or even good, but it isn't quite as crazy third-world as its made to look. I tried withdrawing $1,000 USD from an ATM the other day by pulling the maximum $500 with my debit card, and the max $500 with my wife's. The second transaction failed at the ATM saying it had an unkonwn error, and that same moment my phone rang. It wasn't an automated call, or a 2-factor text, it was an honest to goodness person asking me how I was doing, if everything was okay, and wanted to know if I was aware of where my debit cards were. I told her that I was withdrawing some money from an ATM and I knew it was pushing the limit. She asked where the ATM was located, and I told her, a moment later she said that I should try again and it should go through, and to have a nice evening.
The banks may be corrupt and evil, but they don't want to lose any money so much more than you don't, that it's crazy. And allowing a scammer to pull a bunch of Mt. Gox transactions (or Target for that matter) and walk away with billions of dollars would be an entirely unacceptable level of risk and loss for this industry.

You're right, and some random guy's personal experience does not a sound argument make. And the Target experience was an awesome demonstration of just how broken the CC system is (storing your private key with an untrusted retailer, and depending on them to encrypt it and manage it securely while in transit). The cost of dealing with Credit Cards is high for businesses as a result of the incidental costs (huge Target debacle), operational costs (chargebacks, stolen card fraud), and overhead (Visa and MasterCard don't appear to be hurting for much of anything at the moment).

You're just a troll who gained a lot of attention. The Gentoo bug report is a joke, full of character assassination, and people who don't understand how S.Dice affect the blockchain, why dusting is bad, what awesome positive contributions patches offer the daemon, and how Luke, Andreas, &amp; Gavin aren't enemies of Bitcoin, but rather working extremely hard to democratize it.
Did you know who are doing their best to destroy Bitcoin right now? Fools like Pete Dushenski, Mircea Popescu, and Daniel P. Barron. Turret's laden jerks who have nothing better to do than to turn Bitcoin into an anarchy, and oppose any resemblance of health, growth, or viability as a replacement instrument for global fiat currencies.
These people and those who agree with their religion of anarchy need to be eliminated from the Bitcoin ecosystem; not productive members whose personal beliefs are harmless to the blockchain technology.

Where Blockbuster and Hollywood Video have tremendous advantage is in their brick-and-mortar storefront presence. They have outlets in the majority of countries - including more rural communities - across the planet. Which is nice if you want to get your hands on some a VHS or DVD rental.
But this costs. A lot. Which is why their rental and late fees are exorbitant.
I really hope people transition to streaming video services such as Netflix or Amazon VOD rather than feeling the need for physical discs. But - as you point out - that takes a significant shift in mindset. And for people who don't have computer proficiency, there is comfort in walking out of a branch with a physical video tape with a "please rewind" sticker on it.
I think the transition to streaming video could happen relatively quickly. The potential is certainly there... it ultimately comes down to reducing complexity, getting more people on broadband, and increasing adoption. Maybe someday Netflix will have its chance.

Insanely cheap? Not really, it's actually kinda high. I have access to power at half that (but rackspace is factored into my number, which puts it on par with their figure). If I, in the US, can get 4.4c/kWh and mine with it, and it looks like they're using more expensive PSUs than I am (retail ATX PSUs vs. server PSUs with custom breakouts), and commercial rigs, then I actually end up having a lower mine operational costs than they do. And since security is a thing here, no one is employed to sleep at the mine, it's in a secure business complex.

Technically, Xorg screen lockers aren't security, and can be bypassed with physical access to the machine, such as the FBI had seconds after Ross' eyes were averted from his screen. If he'd had the sense to hold down the power button or otherwise have a hotkey for "discard active session and re-encrypt the disk" then he would have been in a much stronger position.

In the video it says they draw 1.250 mW for their 3% stake in the Bitcoin network, and spend about $80,000 USD/month on power, so about $64/kW. I pay about $75/kW to run my miners here in the States, so that's actually incredibly good if true.
Also they say that they were mining 100 BTC/day/site, and now it's only 25 BTC/day/site. With 3,000 miners per site (also according to the video) and my estimates for current profitability, they probably have something around 3,000x700 GH/s miners that they're operating.
@_date: 2015-02-06 22:11:10

Your numbers actually sound a little generous considering the huge pile of hundreds of dead PSUs and mining rigs that they've been swapping out. Briefly he also mentioned that Avalon should not be in business any more because their rigs are so inefficient, and that they've replaced the old rigs with newer ones that are more power efficient. If they're performing hardware refreshes, and they are clearly using commodity PSUs (not server or specialized), and retail miners (which also appears to be the case), then that's eating into their overhead significantly.
I doubt sincerely if they've stayed profitable after the collapse, and are running on savings (hopefully) stored up during the boom, or receiving additional investment capital to stay them over until the next bubble. But I don't think it's practical to expect an additional hardware refresh to keep their mining revenue above the power cost.
So yes mining will centralize, but this is also the risk associated with institutional mining. Hobbyists don't have that sort of overhead because they have day jobs and the extra power usage is only a small part on top of their regular usage. A hobbyist miner can afford to mine much longer in a depression like we have today than an institutional miner can with rent, salaries, and the costs of maintaining a competitive advantage/satisfying investors.
