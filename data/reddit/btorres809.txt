500 by Sunday 
@_date: 2015-12-17 15:38:54
Be happy we are at 450, we were in the 250 dumps almost all year
@_date: 2015-12-17 16:03:20
I'd rather it takes its time then rush just quickly fall this time its more natural.
@_date: 2015-12-10 20:40:12
Yup replace internet with bitcoin and worldwideweb with blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 17:40:43
You clicked on it so maybe it was.
@_date: 2015-12-01 17:31:10
Yea would be a nice experience I would love to volunteer for that, helping people with wallets and giving away bitcoin to those who are in need. That way you see first hand how bad it really is and how fortunate we are.

2020 will be to late who know what the price will be could be $7000 $10000 or nothing. Nobody know I think its still early get in when you feel comfortable and dont worry much about the day to day losses if you are in for long run like I am.  
@_date: 2015-12-17 15:59:03
We are definitely closing in on gold.  
@_date: 2015-12-11 19:11:22
Does anyone know if eth withdrawl works?
@_date: 2015-12-10 17:15:22

@_date: 2015-12-11 16:46:09
Congrats on making your goal.
@_date: 2015-12-10 20:34:53
 in 2025 we can look back and say same for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-17 16:01:27
But its looking good when we were at 380 it stayed steady for a few weeks, same with 450.00
@_date: 2015-12-08 16:19:43
I did not sense that about him, very good points in the article Bitcoin is much more than a niche currency for small cafes people now have a second option currency that's performing like no other currency has.
@_date: 2015-12-01 16:24:20
It couldn't of been handled any better! 
@_date: 2015-12-15 22:58:13
Bitcoin is not for you if you don't get why you should buy it's not for you
@_date: 2015-12-22 19:03:51
Im in for the long run, if you bought in to high and your pissed off about a dump its not my fault. I'm looking at the long term value 5-10 years from now.
@_date: 2015-12-01 17:07:35
You can buy some from an exchange like coinbase.com or download the circle app. Or see if there is a bitcoin atm where you live just type  
bitcoin atm in google see if there are any then when you buy you use your bitcoin wallet to have bitcoin sent to it.
@_date: 2015-12-17 16:43:15
I have to show this to a coworker he is heavily invested in gold I been trying to get him to get into bitcoin as well
@_date: 2015-12-10 20:44:08
another switch and bait article smh
@_date: 2015-12-18 14:57:57
Why would he destroy what he created?
@_date: 2015-12-17 16:29:32
If it goes to zero its just means one bitcoin is equal to the cost of one ounce of gold. Gold is steadily losing value and bitcoin is gaining.
@_date: 2015-12-17 18:29:47
My Prediction for price $2016

Increase in value
@_date: 2015-12-11 16:41:17
Glad to hear
@_date: 2015-12-14 19:30:36
Yes its a catch 22 because we want the value to go up but we want it to stay low to buy more.
@_date: 2015-12-02 18:34:07
If you are in US search libertyx they have locations where you buy bitcoin in stores
@_date: 2015-12-22 16:47:51

There will be many more dumps to come, this is part of bitcoin right now it volatile. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:19:31
FOH not even reading
@_date: 2016-01-22 15:37:43
Just do your research you don't need people to tell you if you should buy or not. If you feel bitcoin is a good buy for you buy. That's what I did when I invested not brag about my disposable income and ask people to convince me to buy bitcoin.  
@_date: 2016-01-14 17:35:32

I took a loan out of my 401k and used to buy bitcoin I did that around August 2015 when bitcoin was around 250.
@_date: 2016-01-22 15:27:20
Good Idea! Drop some in Delaware for me..
@_date: 2016-01-15 12:34:11
Satoshi left to nobody was worried about that why worry about mike leaving
@_date: 2016-01-12 18:42:23
Check with you plan some let you take out muliple loans. Or take out profit from you bitcoins and pay off so you can take another loan, thats if your plan only allows one loan at time.
@_date: 2016-01-13 19:56:58
yup trying to stock up before the halving
@_date: 2016-01-13 12:25:09
You still have time to buy some, hope you do man!

Bitcoin is here to stay because we need control of our money when and where we can spend it without government intervention
@_date: 2016-01-12 18:32:14
I didn't take to much out wish I would have taken more out, I bought 10 bitcoins with it. I look at it like this in the last 2 years I havn't made much of my 401k and in the last 5 month I almost doubled what I put in.
@_date: 2016-06-27 21:23:53
Would you be interested in domain cryptonoise.com. I was going to use it as a news website for digital currencies but we have to many already. It could work for an exchange.
@_date: 2016-06-16 17:42:47
A lot of resistance at 750
@_date: 2016-06-09 15:11:33
I will give you .0075 if some one else agrees to give you other half as well
@_date: 2016-06-16 16:26:55
@_date: 2016-06-12 16:10:16
Dump all fiat
@_date: 2016-06-18 00:07:38
Dont wait until after halving unless your willing to pay over 1k. Worst advice is telling someone to buy after supply of bitcoins get reduced 50%.
@_date: 2016-06-07 04:08:02
@_date: 2016-06-16 00:55:18
Post that on front page
@_date: 2016-06-13 15:43:28

Thanks throwaway just sent my part
@_date: 2016-06-15 23:39:52
Buy bitcoin otherwise try mining ethereaum looks profitable and with your budget do able then exchange for bitcoin.

I know you want to see how you compare to others but thats like asking how big you peepee is nobody needs to know.

Title of article: Get Ready for the Phoenix
Source: Economist; 01/9/88, Vol. 306, pp 9-10
From the article:
"THIRTY years from now, Americans, Japanese, Europeans, and people in many other rich countries, and some relatively poor ones will probably be paying for their shopping with the same currency. Prices will be quoted not in dollars, yen or D-marks but in, let's say, the phoenix. The phoenix will be favoured by companies and shoppers because it will be more convenient than today's national currencies, which by then will seem a quaint cause of much disruption to economic life in the last twentieth century.
At the beginning of 1988 this appears an outlandish prediction. Proposals for eventual monetary union proliferated five and ten years ago, but they hardly envisaged the setbacks of 1987."
(Note: the writer is apparently referring here to the events related to October 19, 1987 -- often referred to as "Black Monday"-- when stock markets crashed in the U.S. and around the world, shedding a huge value in a very short time.)
@_date: 2016-06-16 16:03:44
Shouldn't take to much longer in last 20 days we have been averaging about $15 per day my guess right around halving.
@_date: 2016-06-25 17:49:07
You probably wont be able to buy that small amout just allow gastonsuper to send to you its only about .70 usd
@_date: 2016-06-28 18:21:58

@_date: 2015-11-20 14:45:58
Thats a good idea only use it when the price goes up.
@_date: 2015-11-23 16:09:24

@_date: 2015-11-07 12:22:13
I kind of did the same thing but I took out a loan on my 401k for 6k. My 401k really wasn't growing so I decided to put it into bitcion.
@_date: 2015-11-30 18:35:18
When you get bitcoin you park them at the nice little address.
