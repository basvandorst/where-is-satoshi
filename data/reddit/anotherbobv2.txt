You should post the email evidence as well.  Its quite a leap on how you arrived at sharkwhite.  Did you have any contact with the moderators at [blackhatword.com](  Hes still active on there if you have the evidence he should be banned at the least.

Why are you so mad?
@_date: 2019-10-07 18:02:54
Who's asking?
@_date: 2019-10-16 18:00:40
Yep, I looked at that when this first started to bother me.  There are a few instances in there where its just snippets of conversation that dont sound like they started with "alexa".  Hence "paranoia".
@_date: 2019-10-16 17:43:15
no there is also the dog.
@_date: 2019-10-16 17:56:25
I got what you meant, thanks.  New seed needed if I move it.
@_date: 2019-10-16 17:55:24






Its just what happened as we were working though it and me trying to explain.


Thats the thing I wanted to to try and gauge how much of a pain in the arse it was to to do vs the risk/value.
@_date: 2019-08-20 12:33:28
Can you expand on that a bit before I sign up to something?  If I convert to GBP with revolut account how do I get that to coinbase?
@_date: 2019-08-20 12:30:37
Wondering the same thing.  What's krakken like these days for bank transfers?  I always used them in the past but it's been a few years now

daughter bought it for her mother as a christmas pressent  turned out to be also quite useful for playing some music when your doing something.
@_date: 2019-10-16 17:42:15
Well, as it was bought by my daughter for her mother then maybe my first mistake was 20 years ago - dont tell her that though eh

You can't use cash app to buy bitcoin in the uk
@_date: 2019-10-16 17:47:53
Ive had this with underpants and garage doors (on amazon) so pretty random.  Might be  apophenia though.
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:50:12
Great.  Thank you.

But that LN node needs to be connected to bitfinex in this example?
@_date: 2019-12-02 22:52:14
I asked this in another thread but it may be better here so here goes...
Am I right in my understanding of lightening network in that if I have a channel open with bitfinex then it can also route payments through other bitfinex users?   Trying to learn here :)
@_date: 2019-12-02 23:04:37
Great its the networking effect of a popular exchange doing this that I was hoping would be be main benefit here - not just the tx fees.  I  wasnt sure if I was misunderstanding things.
@_date: 2019-12-02 23:00:33
Nice, so my semi erection for this news is justified :)
