Did you buy bitcoin with your card, or did you do a bank wire transfer? I think it's the wire transfers they don't accept GBP from, but it's fairly easy if you do an instant buy with your card.

Depends where it is needed the most. In my hometown for instance to rent somewhere livable will probably cost 60-70% of your monthly income. there is a massive housing shortage which only makes the available property more and more expensive.

See the UK doesn't look like there is much adoption on local bitcoins, but thats generally because it's quicker, easier and cheaper to just buy bitcoins from bittylicious or similar sites. I guess we're quite lucky that it's so easy to just buy bitcoin here.

I have been 'in' bitcoin for just over a year now and the same with reddit. This is by far the best post, which has spawned the greatest thread of comments on r/bitcoin so far.
I've learnt more in the last 45 minutes about bitcoin and realised the possibilities for its future than I have in quite some time.
If my bitcoin knowledge was plotted on a graph like bitcoinwisdom, the last 45 minutes would have looked like march 2013.

Lets just use the names for old British money. That was fairly simple.
There were twenty (20) shillings per pound.
The shilling was subdivided into twelve (12) pennies.
The penny was further sub-divided into two halfpennies or four farthings (quarter pennies).
    2 farthings = 1 halfpenny
    2 halfpence = 1 penny (1d)
    3 pence = 1 thruppence (3d)
    6 pence = 1 sixpence (a 'tanner') (6d)
    12 pence = 1 shilling (a bob) (1s)
    2 shillings = 1 florin ( a 'two bob bit') (2s)
    2 shillings and 6 pence = 1 half crown (2s 6d)
    5 shillings = 1 Crown (5s)

Coinbase or bittylicious for ease. Localbitcoins for a better deal.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:18:03
You've got to remember Bitcoin has a huge influx of new people over the past week and i'd guess ~80% of them are all using Coinbase so they could easily be overloaded with people or just low on coins. There are literally hundreds of exchanges you can use, most of which are actually cheaper than Coinbase.

it's just a prediction, we'll only know in a year or two whether it's correct or not.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:36:23
I remember when getting 21 bitcoins (or 1 one-millionth of the supply) was obtainable. I didn't jump on that either back in 2012. You can't dwell on the past, look to the future, the future is looking bright, you are still an early adopter.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:10:12
I will still give a 5 minute explanation of why I love and use bitcoin, but then I tell them that they should really do their own research before spending any money. I tell them that I myself did 3 months of research before I even considered transferring money from my British bank account over to mt.gox. I could've bought bitcoin for $10 but instead I bought my first for $150, I don't mind though because I made sure I educated myself first. Lucky for us there is a lot more information on the web today then there was a few years ago.

Hey, the price amounts are different in the UK.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:13:28
Do your research, and buy some when/if you feel comfortable with it. Don't listen to me, you have to understand it for yourself. I myself spent 3 months reading about bitcoin everyday before I made my first purchase in 2013. But by all means buy a small amount today to play around with, you have a steep learning curve ahead of you.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:17:17
Use an exchange that takes CAD rather than a US exchange. It would literally take a quick google search.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:03:54
Purely guesswork. The last time it felt like this was at the end of 2013. The price rose from $100 to $1000 in a few months and then dropped to ~$250 for the next 3 years before spiking again over the course of this year. I'm just looking at the past and guessing that history might repeat itself.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:19:47
Well the one about Manchester United is obviously nothing to to do with bitcoin... or is it?
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:12:30
Yeah, I understand that. The chart I was referring to is about the amount of energy used per transaction not the network itself.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:52:17
I think if you have to ask reddit whether it's a good idea or not, then you're not ready to take that sort of risk.

@_date: 2017-11-04 17:04:27
I posted this the other day, but I think it'd be cool if you'd used the same amounts that they use in the actual game. Psychologically we would be closer to 1 million right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:33:39
I don't know the exact figure. But according to the article the Bitcoin network is already consuming 50 times more energy per transaction than VISA. Considering Bitcoin isn't even mainstream yet it seems like a massive problem.

No, I was merely sharing the article about the sustainability of bitcoin and it's energy consumption. From reading the article it sounds like a it's a problem and would be good to work towards fixing these problems. I'm not bashing Bitcoin, I'm a long term holder and want it to work in the most efficient way it can.

Depends which country you are in, from what I've read it can take a different amounts of time depending where in the world you are. Coinbase is nice and simple, but charges higher fee's and can take a couple of days to register properly.

The 7pm news on Channel 4 in the UK in early 2013 did a whole section on Silk Road. I then went on to research and found out about bitcoin just in time for that spike in Mar/Apr 2013. I subsequently joined reddit because of it and this particular sub.

A lot of people are probably like myself, they only made a reddit account to ask questions about bitcoin. Bitcoin has seen a huge increase in new users over the past month, and with that come new reddit accounts.

From five years ago being 'that guy' and everyone being a little bit bored by my constant talking about bitcoin. To the last month or so, I have had around 10 family members and friends call me up, or start a conversation saying they want to buy some, or have just bought some. It's happening!
