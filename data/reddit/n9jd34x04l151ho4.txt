Largest price probably follows the majority chain in the event of the hard fork. Who knows. Up to the market.


I think there is no choice for Segwit1x supporters. They can fork at the same time as well, add replay protection at the same time and go their own way if they really want. No sense trying to dictate terms to everyone else with only 6.8% support. That's like the tail wagging the dog. If their vision is really the best, the market will decide that.

Why don't you just stay in this echo chamber you've created for yourself.

[It's pretty easy to see that Segwit 2X has 93.2% support.]( Segwit 1x has 6.8% support.


To add replay protection to Core would create a new coin, how?


Possibly true, Segwit 1x will get steamrolled either way. Or they can try fork off with 6.8% of the miners.

I don't think there's a market for a stagnant Bitcoin remnant coin with only 6.8% of the user base. It would probably be comparable to an alt coin at about 100-200 places down the list rated by market cap.

The chain with the _least_ consensus should add replay protection if they want their chain to survive post fork. If 2X goes through as planned and there's no replay protection on the smallest chain, that will [eject the Core]( developers and a new team will be in charge of Bitcoin going forward.
