As a NAB shareholder in my 20s, this scares me. Must be something to do with reducing their real or perceived risk profile in the short term. It certainly makes me consider cashing out especially if I don't get some response from email or letter. Anyone else....?

This is the reason bitcoin cash forked off. Unfortunately, segwit will not adequately resolve this especially when transaction volume increases in the future.

I can't see bitcoin having any intrinsic value if it can't be used for low cost instantaneous transactions. It becomes just some rare number on your computer. Gold on the other hand has intrinsic value because it is useful for products and industry, not just shiny and nice to look at. This whole scaling debate is really weird.
