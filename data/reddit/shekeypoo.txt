That is if it holds on to 11500 Chinese new year is coming up 
And they love to spend money during the whole month of Feb 
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:32:37
Feb 16th is Chinese new year, in any case, it would dip even lower by then 
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:23:11
Hmm.. No if you check last year March also had a big dip
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:00:52
Really??... 
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:52:49
I have been advising people to sell around 16k 
Trust me we will continue to dip 
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:37:02
Buy bitconnect 
The next big bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:24:39
Do you know the exact date that Robinhood opens for crypt trading? 
Nope, but the insiders do, 
They will time it well 
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:35:28
You compare Chinese new year with Thanksgiving lol wtf is wrong with you 
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:32:34
Didn’t he sell all his ltc at ath lol 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:07:52
You know we are heading for a bigger dip right? If you are in need of money I would say take the money out 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:33:30
All you guys seriously have to do is google crypto news.... 
No wonder investors don’t go on reddit anymore 
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:47:48
From 9k back to 10k 
It said on the article 
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:47:56
Get into inside groups and pay attention to news 
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:28:12
Buy high sell low
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:40:58
Guess I'm just in a place with stupid people 
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:28:46
You must not be a Chinese. Every Chinese new year people would buy cars and everything new. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:54:25
Yea I guess.. pulled outta 16k waiting for a bigger dip to buy back in is being a loser.. alright 
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:05:29
Going down now...
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:45:24
I just hope people would listen
I have been posting since when it was at 16k 
But it seems like no one ever listen 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:31:50
I know you guys want to hear moon news.
But let’s be real here 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:54:09
Bitcoin will be dipping for the next few weeks 
I would suggest just take out your money 
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:55:58
I guess this is reddit 
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:25:21
This is why I stop gathering info from reddit 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:54:50
Predicted it will drop to around 8000 
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:22:26
We are down 300billion market cap right now...
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:04:48
Bitcoin is heading down  right now 
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:29:51
Not only gifts, but also people usually buy new cars and new everything 
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:57:16
Down toward spike
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:23:47
He is giving you an example...
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:19:48
Not my penis 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:48:33
 Bitcoin.
I think crypto would definitely take over one day but not bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:58:51
Tbh it’s all gambling now. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:39:34
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:01:47
Shut up
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:33:26
You need math 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:57:18
Thanks ! 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:26:02
I would say yes but the answer is no lol
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:09:41
Name him/her Coindog 
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:24:04

@_date: 2017-12-11 03:01:18
Bitcoin will never be the future currency, everyone knows that 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:45:17
I’m just afraid a big dip 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:24:45
Ooooooooh that’s the problem 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:26:15
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:18:10
I would just buy other cheaper coins
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:07:14
Hodl Hodl Hodl!!! Merry Christmas!!!

@_date: 2017-12-08 03:01:49

@_date: 2017-12-25 10:12:06
OP dies... kid doesn’t know about the bitcoin seed being behind the art... kid doesn’t go to college.... kid has no money for home.... kid becomes a homeless....
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:07:10
What website did you use to do that? And do u still have to tax?
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:22:32
It’s going down fast 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:16:17
Damn you would have around 800k by now..
What was blockchain.info’s repose? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:42:44

@_date: 2019-11-24 03:38:42
Yea sure  With the price dropping.. so it will be used for laundry washing ��
@_date: 2019-11-24 03:39:59
This will be OP’s second failure after failing school
@_date: 2019-11-10 08:52:58
“Watch out for girls from tinder” ?

@_date: 2017-12-28 10:27:39
Ok 
@_date: 2019-02-25 12:30:24
Only if bitcoin was up then you would have used gold sheet.
@_date: 2019-02-26 15:56:19
You should just pay off your credit cards and cut them all
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:04:08
Light 
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:29:57
I think they are only looking at the “day graph”
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:53:58
“Apply cold water to burned area”
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:30:58
Hey but you missed classes tho 
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:55:10
And professors are allow to call doctors lol so don’t miss any classes ahaha (to OP) 
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:21:43
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:30:54
I honestly think you should learn some math before trading...
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:22:09
Nice sandals tho
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:18:10
The hell..?
@_date: 2018-11-29 02:10:35
I’m sure he had zero bitcoin right now 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:08:44
Have you done any research?? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:57:06
Every year the Asians cash out for Chinese new year 
Not only the crypto world
The stock world is the same for years 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:08:37
Ever heard of USDT?
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:24:07
Honest opinion, I think it will bounce back in the beginning of March 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:09:45
Chinese don't follow rules... 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:29:04
Just here to FUD ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:31:05
Another big dip coming for Chinese new year 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:11:02
How do you think they buy coins in the same place then..?? With Chucky cheese coins? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:56:11
Agree, 
@_date: 2019-09-25 04:57:49
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:17:42
Sounds like you are just a dumbass that bought at ATH and can't get out  lol 
Don't be too mad
