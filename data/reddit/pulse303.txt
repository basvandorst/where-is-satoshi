You don't have to type it manually, just use a QR scanner on your Iphone that will translate the QR code in the Private key (a long string of random letters) 
That you can import in your blockchain wallet.
It really is only so complicated because Apple is a hugeh pain in the a**
Android + Mycelium, that would take 5seconds.

You can use your own wallet on you PC, Mac, Anroid, iOS, Linux.

what do you do in order to get USD?
You work, well people can actually do work for BTC, and they are doing it.
Or you sell something in order to get BTC.
Privacy is really not that important if you order something legal online, you leave your shipping address after all. On the other hand nobody can prove who ordered the Item to your house.

The main issue for economist about bitcoin is its deflationary manner.
All our modern day economist are used and convinced that only an inflationary currency can work.
Thats like meeting the brightest economist from the the Soviet Union and ask them what they think about free trade and capitalism.
Although those people would have high IQs and respected in their field, they would dismiss those concepts in the same way our economist dismiss deflationary money.
So it just comes down to politics.
From a game theory point of view.
If people will really have the choice to choose were to store their value, Fiat vs Bitcoin (In a world were bitcoin is everywhere accepted) 
I don't see how someone would still use a currency that is essentially a Ponzi Scheme (Fractional reserve banking)

So again for a lawyer:
A person with a Bank account in Cyprus didn't have the opportunity to transfer they money internationally.
Just a quick google search, you can find more articles about it.
 
And as a layer you shouldn't be surprised to see countries of the EU breaking contracts or the EU itself just ignoring contracts.

a lot of freelancing programer get paid in BTC, and people and services that are around BTC.
Its a chicken/egg problem that will be solved over time and we are on a very good path with that.
I could also imagine that as soon as some of the suppliers of Tigerdirect or other merchants that accept bitcoin tell them that they also would like to accept bitcoin instead of USD. That Tigerdirect will keep part of their bitcoin and not exchange everything through bitpay.

Offer the option to sent someone the equivalent in BTC if they are from outside the US.

So can you explain where the difference is?
From what I can tell the only difference is that Franctional reserve banking is legal and needs a license.
While FRB doesn't promise the customers high returns, they keep those returns to themselves.
They don't have the capital that their customers deposited. 
Bernard Madoff ran the same thing. He gave out returns to his investors, but those returns were their own money, and the true value of his Investment Fund was faked, in reality it was much lower.
The same goes for Banks, 1000 customers deposit money, The Bank starts to give this money out as a loan, without rewarding the customers. Now If all 1000 customers want to withdraw their money the Bank won't be able to provide that money because part was loaned to other creditors.
So the bank practically cooks their books about their money supply, every customer thinks his money is actually being stored in the Bank. And He pays fees for that.
But In reality the books are just cooked, the only difference is that all this is totally legal.
And please I would like to hear where Im wrong, Im willing to pick up a book that you might recommend if you gave me a few good arguments why Im wrong.

People that get paid in Bitcoin or have a lot of their liquid assets in Bitcoin will use BTC because its just more convenient.
And when this growth rate of acceptance continues, people can start to switch completely to bitcoin.
E.g. convert their whole paycheck instantly to bitcoin and hold that money until they need it. Because they know that they can pay almost everything with bitcoin.
A broader acceptance with more market depth will also lead to lower volatility.
But they next milestone for bitcoin is to be traded on the regular Forex Exchange or Commodity markets.
That will not only be good for the reputation of bitcoin. But it will decrease the volatility tremendously in longterm, short-term it will cause wild swings.
But yeah it would be nice to see that those companies pass on their CC savings on to the costumers, the market will manage that I guess.

2. What restrictions are in place for payments abroad? What transfers abroad are allowed?
 
The Decree prohibits cashless payments or transfers of money abroad, except:
(i) payment or transfer of money abroad for a transaction which falls within the usual business activity of the client within specified limits;
(ii) payment of salaries of workers abroad which can be made upon the presentation of the relevant documentation;  
(iii) living expenses up to €5.000 per quarter for the tuition fees of a person studying abroad; and
(iv) transfer abroad of up to €5.000 per month per person per credit institution and/or payment institution regardless of purpose.

why is it a gamble at all?
Its not a switch, its an addition for a payment method.
And as of right now and in the future every merchant can just use bitpay. 
The Addition of this payment method is quite trivial.
Its completely risk free.

That were the only countries he mentioned.
Zipzap business model is to provide an payment solution for customers that don't have access to credit cards or online banking. So US isn't the priority since most people in the US have credit cards.

ZipZap is not a Bitcoin only business.

Matt you can also get into the macro economics part of bitcoin which is very interesting.
Thats a good start:
If you want more articles on the possible effect on the economy, lets me know I will provide you some links.
Also maybe you can play that part 
So people like the BowTie guy will give it a second thought.
Some people say its the greatest invention since the internet.
I could go as far as saying it could be the biggest invention since the internal combustion engine. 
Thats a very bold claim, but if you start to think about the macro economic impact it might have you start to see the big picture.

That news is major, merchants can advertise the fees of VISA and Mastercard now.
Before that it was forbidden for them. 
Which in turn meant that customers that would pay in Cash or bitcoin would also pay the 3% higher fee that is automatically included in the price of the products.
In Europe we have a law that requires Airlines to advertise the Creditcard fees and also advertise that a bankpayement would save the customers around 10$. That way customers are much more wiser to choose a payment method that will save them money.
I personally always get angry at Visa and Mastercard when I see those high fees displayed so directly. 
And to be honest I only learned about the high fees through booked Airline tickets (long time ago) 
I think most customers are absolutely not aware about the high credit card fees.

0-Proof confirmations are extremely safe.
The doublespending problem is blown out of proportion. 
I would suggest your company uses coinbase or bitpay to accept the bitcoins and verify your bitcoins since they have very good connected "power nodes" that can check very quick if there is a conflict in the network that looks like a double spend attack.
Just in comparison, worrying about a double spend attack is like worrying about being hit by meteor.
Its more an intellectual problem, that is and interesting to talk about but the success rate in reality is extremely low.

Very simple for every wanna be entrepreneur to understand whats the buzz about bitcoin, just watch every video with andreas antonopoulos on youtube.
If you (the entrepreneur) are still not intrigued by bitcoin, just point a gun to your head and click.
