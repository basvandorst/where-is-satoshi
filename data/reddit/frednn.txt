ok, that clears it up. it was a stupid question. thanks for taking time to answer

currently with delays in confirmation, and such high prices, i think it serves mostly as a store of value, than a daily currency. more like gold, as opposed to dollar.
you cant spend gold as easily either.
my personal opinion

bitcoin is supposed to be kept at a difficulty compared to network hashrate, that allows a block to be mined every 10 minutes, right ?
24 hrs x 60 mins = 1440 mins
1440 / 10 = 144 blocks
do you mean my calculations are wrong in some way ?
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:58:14
that would explain alot. where does one find addresses related to active pools ?

I appreciate the world's interest in what happens in Iran, and how people from all around the world are eager to help us in times of need, but I think :
An organization, like the Red Cross itself, or other ones "who have credibility" and people trust,  have to announce this through their website or social media account, with a signature from that address, thus verifying the address, their control over the funds, and their own authority in the same time.
Anything other than that is shady.

How do I know it's Iranian Red Cross address ? I mean who published this ? What is their authority ? Who has the private key ?

I understand it better now.
Thank you

you DO understand nowadays sometimes blocks take as long as AN HOUR to be found, right ? 
waiting 20 minutes after buying your coffee, or subway ticket, DOES NOT guarantee your transaction being confirmed. even if it does, are you willing to stay for 20 minutes after you buy a bag of chips ?
and by the way, when you are (supposedly) having an intellectual argument with someone, using phrases like "you stupid shit" and "your personal opinion sucks" makes people question your ideology  and intelligence over all.
cheers !

what makes me look clueless ? elaborate, please !

thanks for the thorough reply. Good points ! I just meant the entropy though, I am aware of vulnerability of modern electronic equipment.
no electronic device is at the peak of safety these days.

I don't think you have enough sun light in Vancouver.
 I heard it's mostly cloudy there. And not to mention, sun doesn't get high enough in Canada except a couple months in the summer. The degree at which light rays hit your solar panels, matter. 
The output of today's solar panels is not really that much. You will need A LOT of them, AND a lot of free space to set them up, to be able to feed a miner. I don't think you can feed a miner with a couple blocks in you backyard in Vancouver.

What keeps me awake at night is that one of the keys that my Bitcoin wallet software created could be the same as the hash value of something stupidly easy , like "hello there General Kenobe !"

You can always use lightening network to spend inputs. Much lower fee.
On regular on-chain transaction, the fee depends on the input address type. If its one compressed address, with 1 sat/B fee, you can get your tx confirmed with as low as 226 sats. But that depends on backlog of transactions waiting to be confirmed.
You could Wait for the network to become less congested, and then send a transaction using both your addresses as inputs, and a single address as output. This will get your funds into the new address for about 452 sats
Right now, you have to spend 20 times as much to have it confirmed in a couple hours.
This, is with the assumption that you have those funds in 2 different addresses. You mentioned "2 different wallets", so that could mean each of those wallets could have the funds in more than 1 address

The funds were taken from 4 addressed, and were deposited in 1 address ( your paper wallet)
When you want to spend that in the future, if the transaction is not for the whole amount, the tx will look like this :
Input : paper wallet
Output 1 : destination address
Output 2 : remaining sum, getting back to paper wallet
So it will use only 1 input : your paper wallet
Those 4 inputs were your old transaction which brought the funds to your paper address, and has been confirmed and dealt with.
Hope this answers your question

How about market cap ?

I'd go with Electrum.
you can set fees as low as 1 sat/byte to as much as you like. 
Plus it is the only wallet i know that supports cold storage. you can install one on your hot pc ( connected to internet ) and have your public keys on it, and install one on your cold PC ( never connected to internet, never have, never will ) and have it store your private keys. 
then you can monitor your funds on your hot PC, and create transactions on it, then put file transactions on a usb stick, take it to the cold pc, sign it using your private key, then bring the signed tx back to hot pc and broadcast it.
like every other wallet, you need to keep both PCs clean, and under watch. 
IMO cold storage capability is a nice option to have these days.
