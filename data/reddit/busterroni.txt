I'm not sure if it's /29, but it makes sense that it would be easier to find since there are more spaces it could be found. It wouldn't be difficult to test.

Why would they go through that effort? They could easily just purchase enough mining power to gain control of the network if they wanted.

I think you're right, but if we're going to be technical about it there were actually something like 14,999,999.8023 btc at block 389,999 because miners don't always claim the full reward, so if it should've been 389,999 it was actually 390,000.

I'm not sure what you mean. These coins *were* already created in a block. They are included in the total because those fees were created in the past (whether it was one block ago or hundreds of thousands).

You wouldn't need to write out the public key. And it would probably be better to use multisig where you and UPS both have a key so only UPS (and not someone who finds your mail) can get the btc. But why not just buy the stamp ahead of time with btc, or pre-pay for the letter? I think putting the private key on the letter is unnecessary.

* "products and services anonymously on the online." You don't wanna have that mistake on there while you're reading your speech :P
* Your description of an altcoin in the first paragraph is a bit unclear. I always find it helpful to say an altcoin is to a peso as bitcoin is to a dollar; that usually helps people understand them.
* "will go down until blocks reward six and a quarter coins." This is incorrect, it will be that in two halvings. It will keep going until the reward is *slightly* more than 0 (see [this link]( for more info).
* I would discuss how Bitcoin isn't only used online, it can be used to purchase things in real life too.
Looks good! Mind if I ask what grade you're in?

This is actually an interesting question, I might write up a script to figure it out. I'll get back to you.
Edit: Ok, I wrote a script that uses Blockchain.info's API since I don't have the block chain downloaded. This is the basic idea of what the script would be though (python). I wouldn't recommend running this as it'd take a long time to run since you'd have to make over 350,000 requests to blockchain.info and they'd probably block you from making more requests.
    from blockchain import blockexplorer
    diff=0
    diffBlock=0
    for i in range(0, blockexplorer.get_latest_block().height):
    	blockOne=blockexplorer.get_block_height(i)[0]
    	blockTwo=blockexplorer.get_block_height(i+1)[0]
    	if blockTwo.time-blockOne.time&gt;diff:
    		diff=blockTwo.time-blockOne.time
    		diffBlock=blockTwo    
    print(diffBlock.height)

No, the way it works is there are two private keys, I only know one, and the customer knows the other one. I give them the private key I have, and they combine it with their private key.

They do matter, because no one lost *their* coins, because they *aren't* their coins. You can't own bitcoins, you can only have access to them.

If he gains access to their private key (which he did) then he can sweep them. He didn't do anything illegal (that I know of) to gain access to their private keys. He got their private keys from a security flaw in Blockchain.info's code.
@_date: 2014-03-26 21:44:35
While I see what you're saying, that's not 100% how it works (I generate vanity addresses for others). The way it works is that there are two private keys: one is given to the person who wants the vanity address, and the other is mined by the person who gets the vanity addresses. It's safe, assuming that the people on both sides are to be trusted (and, in this case, the middleman connecting the buyer of the address to the finder of the address).
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:29:29

I would definitely think this to be true also, but from personal experience it's not. I only know one other high schooler who uses Bitcoin (maintains miners with his dad). I go to a weekly Bitcoin meetup in Philly and have seen pictures from other meetups. At my meetups I've always been the youngest by at least 7 years, and would say the average age is about 28 YO. From pictures from other meetups I get the same impression. It's vey surprising to me. I thought the average age at my meetup would be 20 year old college students.

That's phishing, the problem is that every time we report the phishing site and Google warns the user trying to go to the scam website, the guy running the site switches to a new subdomain and we need to re-report the phishing.
Now we're attacking it at the source by reporting it to Google Adwords, rather than Google's phishing site.

The simple way to explain it is that it comes from the server. Approximately every 10 minutes a new 'block' is found. Each block contains 25 Bitcoins which are sent to the user who mined the block. The blocks are all made up of a larger 'blockchain', which is like a public record of all of the blocks. Every single Bitcoin transaction can be traced by looking at the blockchain. You can explore it here: 
'Height' is the number block that that block was. We're currently on block

I disagree. Kids are by nature curious, and while they may be interested with the newest technology, they're interested in the newest technology of its *type*. There is no 'newer, better' Bitcoin, so they won't feel as though there's a newer, cooler currency to use.

The creator of Bitcoin is anonymous; no one knows who he is. He uses the pseudonym 'Satoshi Nakamoto'. He cannot give himself Bitcoins because Bitcoin is open source, meaning anyone can contribute to its code, and since it's open source, the code cannot be modified without a group agreeing on what code to add. Satoshi cannot just create Bitcoins out of thin air because they'd need to edit the code to do that, which they cannot do. However, considering that Satoshi created the initial code for Bitcoin, they had the opportunity to mine a ton of Bitcoins without much competition from other miners (since they were one of the first, if not *the* first miner), and is currently estimated to have over 1,000,000 Bitcoins. That's currently worth $523,500,000 (523.5 million)!


* It takes time for the 'confirmations' to occur. Confirmations are a way to make sure that your Bitcoins were sent safely, and to prevent against fraudulently sending Bitcoins. Most businesses require one or more confirmations, and each confirmation takes on average ten minutes.
* While this may be minor compared to fees from banks and USD/other currency transactions, there's a fee of .0001 for sending Bitcoins, currently equal to $0.052 (5.2 cents).
* If your Bitcoin wallet is not secured, it can be hacked into and all of your Bitcoins can be stolen. Taking proper precautions can greatly lower your chances of getting hacked.


It all depends on the exchange. Also, there is no 'official' exchange, just as there's no official US currency exchange. Some exchanges allow you to deposit instantly, while others require you to submit personal information to be manually reviewed.

I'm far from an expert in economics, but from what I understand Bitcoin's market cap is around $5billion, which is less than the worth of many people and businesses. It would cost more than $5billion to buy all the bitcoins, because buying so many will drive the price up. However, buying maybe $100million worth is a relatively huge percentage of Bitcoin and wouldn't drive the price up an absurd amount. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

No... they shouldn't. A major advantage of Bitcoin is that it *removes* the extremely high processing fees, and being willing to pay extra defeats the purpose of that feature.

Why do you say that? Assuming you're talking about the conversion to USD (if Fiverr does that), [Coinbase charges 1%]( and that's after the first $1,000,000, which is free, and I'm not sure if Fiverr's hit $1mil in bitcoin yet.

Yep. Something that may be of interest to you (thanks for pointing out this article, as that's why I figured this out!) is that Bitcoin is currently [nominated as a Good Article]( which means that an editor is proposing that it's some of Wikipedia's best work. I left some comments.

[Simplified Payment Verification](
From what I understand it doesn't download the blockchain to your computer, but rather it's hosted online and your computer connects to it. However, the huge blockchain size issue must be fixed if we want people to run nodes.
[MultiBit]( uses SPV. Syncing everything up takes &gt;10 seconds usually.

I tried saving it in the internet archive first, which said it was down. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:38:45
Two things I can think of right now against that:
* Someone could have hundreds of addresses from two years ago with btc in them.
* That would disqualify newcomers from voting.
I'm not trying to shoot you down, I definitely think a method of voting is needed. Keep thinking! :)

Nice photos! :) Keep it up. +1000 bits.
@_date: 2015-01-06 00:01:15
That doesn't explain [this]( why, if it's an average across exchanges, did it only show Bitstamp's price? Or did the app that the screenshot is from make a mistake and put Bitstamp's price for BitPay?
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:14:29
It isn't a fair system. Right now I could have 10,000,000,000 btc and send it to 10,000,000,000 different addresses so each one has 1 btc. This means the rich decide the vote.

This is two hours after they published the article "Amazon Says: Will Break PayBase Integration" which quoted Amazon as saying that they are not working with Paybase (or something like that, I don't remember exactly). If anyone has an archived version of the article, please link.
@_date: 2015-01-30 05:04:53
Two things:
* I still disagree, .01 (or any amount for that matter) may be too much for someone; what about a person who is extremely poor and trying to access or something.
* A rich person could have power to vote hundreds of (or more) times by spreading their btc between addresses. Sure there are transaction fees, but $0.02 isn't much to pay for an additional vote.
I agree that a decentralized reddit/news site would be great, but I don't think proof-of-ownership of btc is the way to go.

Active Wikipedia editor here– Editors themselves cannot edit in problems that they see with it themselves, there needs to be a reputable source. For example, if I know, 100% for a fact, that a 51% attack on the network is a theoretical problem with Bitcoin, and I edited in that fact without a reference, someone else would either revert my edit or add a reference to, say, Coindesk, explaining the potential of such an attack.

There's two different pictures. Each one has some random black squares and some random clear squares on them. When you put each picture on top of each other in a certain direction, they form a single QR code because the black squares from one picture pass through the clear squares from the other picture. The QR code can then be scanned and give a private key to access bitcoins.
With only one picture, the QR code can't be scanned to get the private key: you need both pictures. Get it?

Generally a good, quick, method (although certainly not infallible) is to Google the name of the company whose site you're supposedly on and use that link (because even if the domains look the same, scammers can be sneaky with capital I's/lowercase l's and such).
Scam sites can still rank high in Google, and they often buy ads, so you still need to be careful.

That isn't really true. Some member of the pool will mine the block, they just won't get the whole 12.5+ btc reward (and iirc some pools give a bonus to the user who mines the block).

@_date: 2017-01-02 23:47:48
Because blocks are mined by *someone* every 10 minutes. There's no guarantee that Slush mined those blocks. [According to Blockchain.info]( Slush mines 7.6% of blocks.

@_date: 2017-08-22 05:27:24
@_date: 2017-01-02 23:32:49
~~I'm not positive how Slush's pool works but I'm pretty sure I can guess. Your shares only count for the current block being mined. After the block is mined, your shares reset at 0, regardless of whether Slush mined the block or not. Since blocks are mined on average every 10 minutes, that means unless Slush found a block within 10 minutes after you stopped mining, you probably won't get a reward. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.~~

You can support a different solution while simultaneously believing not everyone has to run a full node.
Also I haven't made my mind up regarding block size.

You don't verify someone has access to an address by sending its secret key. It technically would work, but it would give you access to all of their coins. What you would do to verify someone has access to an address is have them [sign a message]( The method for doing this varies by wallet.

I was looking at the network requests on that site and it's interesting, it looks like it loads each of `/block/`, `/tx/`, and `/addr/` and sees which one works. If I figure out how it works I'll get back to you.

I was thinking the way I would do it would be using my bot ((the hyphen should be an underscore, but I don't want to call it here)). A user would call it and changetip in one comment. The user would tip the bot .0001 btc (one standard tx fee), and once I confirm the changetip went through, the bot would send a small amount of btc to an address that I control, and including a message in OP_RETURN in the transaction.

The biggest reason is that there just isn't really a reason I can think of why it's better to use the private key method. It can only cause problems, like accidentally reusing the address that you both have the private key for.
@_date: 2015-08-24 05:46:03


Never heard of this before, but I had thought about it happening in the past and now I know it has a name. For anyone else wondering, it's when a person/group of people mines bitcoin with a huge hashrate and drives the difficulty way up, then stops mining, making it extremely difficult for other miners to mine any blocks.
@_date: 2015-07-12 00:44:49
But what transaction would we link to if the person didn't give a txid? And if they do put the txid (with a link to blockchain.info), it does tell the tx fee. I'm soon making it so you don't need to link to blockchain.info though; it'll respond when you just post a txid. For example: 
**Edit**: Nevermind, apparently I turned off the info feature in the last update for some reason. I'll add it back tonight. [Here's]( an example though.

1. Yes, if you have the private key, you can access the same address from any number of wallets.
2. You shouldn't need to "refresh" your backups. The private key will always have the correct amount of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-17 01:26:11
If you transferred the funds to another wallet, the person who scans the private key after you would not be able to get your bitcoins. If I were you I'd just check the address connected to the private key to check if it has any bitcoins.

[Vanitygen]( is a program that allows you to create bitcoin addresses that start with a certain string of text (it can also be in the middle or the end, but that takes a bit more work). Once you set up the program, you can choose a prefix and the program will create tens of thousands of bitcoin addresses per second until it finds one that starts with your prefix. For example, if I chose the prefix "1test", it would run through thousands of addresses until it found one starting with "1test". The longer the prefix, the harder it is to find an address that starts with it, so it'll take longer. Once it finds it, it gives you the address and its private key. Here, generating "1bit..." took about 10 seconds: 1bitKnd6uYMDrXh6k7TKLPDzzbMQf3qhe

Loading a private key doesn't transfer the bitcoins. Think of it like a bank account: If two people have the password to one account, the balance doesn't go away; it's just both people can spend the money that's in it. The same with Bitcoin. If two people have a private key in two different wallets, both can spend the bitcoins, but just adding the private key to a wallet does not transfer them.

Generally, vanity addresses are meant to be reused (e.g. an organization's tip address).


There's actually a method called split-key generation which is just as safe as generating the private key yourself, but allows someone else to do it for you. I've used it before.

I'll look into this, definitely a good idea. It'll take some math to work out and I'd want it to be pretty accurate so people don't get screwed over by the bot, but it's certainly a possibility in the near future (thinking this weekend I'll look into it).

@_date: 2015-07-01 03:04:26
All major wallets don't. If they're good wallets, they'll generate the address randomly. Wallets can vanity generate an address to customize them *a bit*, but I don't know of any wallets that do this. Let me know if you wanna know more about vanity generation.

Sure. You can sign a message with your private key. It's how systems like  on Freenode IRC works.
Edit: For more info, the website could give you a message to sign with the private key. bitcoin-otc gives you a random string of characters, but the site could make you sign something like "verifying zastels for example.com 09/09/2015 15:04".

If it's even bigger than this (maximum characters for a comment) it will just give a link to the transaction on multiple block explorers. I think I'm going to lower the maximum to just post a link.

@_date: 2015-09-16 00:03:42
It puts a message in a block's coinbase, which can only be done when their pool mines a block. You can only include one message per coinbase.
Alternatively, you (I mean anyone, you don't have to be a mining pool) can put a message in the block chain by putting a message in OP_RETURN in a transaction.

I'm sure it's different for every mobile wallet, but do you have to use a mobile wallet? And what I'm saying is he could get a wallet which allows importing of other wallets, and it wouldn't be a big deal if he deleted it by accident.

Maybe you could generate an address for him, import it into his wallet, and if he ever loses it you can just give him the private key again.

Of course, simple random address may be burn addresses, but they aren't *proof of* burn. Thanks for the tips.

I know that reddit's API limits to the 1,000 most recent posts/comments, and looking at [your code]( I see that:
    subreddit_comment = r.get_comments(subName, limit=1000)
    subreddit_posts = r.get_submissions(subName, limit=1000)
With this code, how do you get posts/comments from *all* time, and not just the 1,000 most recent ones?

Sure, all addresses are equally likely to be generated. But there's no way to prove that someone doesn't have the private key to an address like 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa — it could very well have been generated randomly. However, with an address like 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE, the chances of someone generating that address and having the private key to it are incredibly slim. I'm sorry if I'm not explaining it well, let me know if you still don't understand.

You can use a wallet like MultiBit which doesn't require downloading the entire chain and isn't a webwallet.
@_date: 2015-09-20 03:10:18
I don't agree with this method, but either way, sending bitcoin isn't the way to do it. People could just sign a message with a private key that has &gt;x bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-09-20 04:59:00

"Request" generates a QR code so people can send bitcoins to your bitcoin address. "Send" is where you input an address to send bitcoins to. There is no reason why you should have lost your bitcoins if you were messing with "request". Do you still see your bitcoins on the left side of MultiBit?

To clarify, it's not every 4 years. It's every 210,000 blocks, which averages out to every four years.
average 1 block/10 mins
60 mins in an hr/10 mins=6 blocks/hr
6*24 hrs per day=144 blocks/day
144*365 days per year=52,560 blocks/year
210,000 blocks to halve the reward/52,560=~3.995 years to mine 210,000 blocks
It's not exact due to leap years and maybe some other things, not sure.

Up for me.

50,000 doge is $6.41.

Bitcoin Quiz.

Maybe really popular ones. 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa.com (genesis block reward address) is already taken.

There already are Bitcoin classes in colleges :P
@_date: 2015-10-09 20:24:21
Might want to confirm it's still happening, sometimes people auto-RSVP and the meetups are no longer active.
@_date: 2015-10-09 19:52:45
Have you checked meetup.com?

That isn't true. They aren't truly non-spendable, just realistically. Unmined coins literally do not exist. Burned coins do.


That's not true -- they *can* **possibly** be restored, it's just extremely unrealistic. They still exist and can in theory be spent.

Something I still don't get... Was reddit notes something you were working on? If so, did it get shut down?
@_date: 2015-02-04 04:35:37
But then it isn't decentralized...
@_date: 2015-03-28 18:48:19
They didn't ask for a technical explanation. They asked a very fair question, don't be a dick.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:34:37
All coins are counted.
@_date: 2015-02-09 04:29:15
This is probably the most correct answer, although there may be other explanations.

That's six days' difference, far from 10 minutes. However I think I remember reading somewhere that Satoshi wasn't mining constantly.
@_date: 2015-10-27 18:47:41
Isn't it open source? Someone else can put it up.
@_date: 2019-05-07 06:39:37
@_date: 2015-10-14 16:40:05
It's not, because those coins still exist, just (in reality) can't be spent. Check out btcburns.cf for a burned btc count.

10 transaction fees
Mods shouldn't be censoring anything.
@_date: 2015-03-23 02:28:12
I'll try :)
@_date: 2015-03-29 12:14:18
Thanks for the feedback :) Happy Cake Day!

I see you've had 1 answered, so I'll do 2.


It depends on the store. For every one I've gone to that accepts Bitcoin, they just had me scan a QR code that was on the register or behind the counter that linked to their address and had me send the exact amount I owed them (which they calculated manually using bitcoin price websites). I know that some places use third-party software like [BitPay]( to handle transactions. I'm not sure what you mean by RF code but I'm tired so maybe I'm just not thinking of it. I'm also sure some people are experimenting with [near field communication]( (NFC) for in-person transactions.
@_date: 2016-05-24 09:41:32
Such as? You wouldn't be able to send an SMS without paying btc, so spam isn't a problem if that's what you mean.
@_date: 2016-05-06 00:23:36
But messages can still be signed with it.
