Great feedback, thank you! We definitely have on our list of features to add a filter to display just your portfolio (coins that you own some positive number of). I need to go throw some more burgers and pizzas into the programmer dungeon to get that going. And the top 10 currencies is another great idea...maybe the ability to sort by (and by default sorted by) market cap descending? I'm not sure what the "top 10" currencies are...how would you define that?

Excellent points. To be fair, probably the biggest reasons we haven't done this yet are 1) we just launched, and 2) it's not clear how to do it correctly with making our UI much more complicated, and/or accumulating a profile of a user that could potentially be personally identifying. Just because the government knows how many Bitcoins you've bought doesn't mean they know how many altcoins you have...
The short answer to your question is that we use the BitcoinAverage prices along with the most recent transaction data from cryptsy to calculate these values. This is not exact, for many reasons:
-the bitcoin average is not a real offer to buy bitcoins at that price--you could, after converting to bitcoins, get much less or much more than that, depending on where you sell them
-we (for now) ignore transaction costs which may not be insignificant
-we could (and perhaps should) use more real-time volume data to hypothetically match your coins up with real-time buy orders, but what if you own more coins than there are buy orders on a given exchange?
-selling all your coins could in some cases significantly devalue them, right, like crashing the market
-where are your coins located? Are they already on the exchange we're using to calculate prices? Would you have to transfer them from cold storage to cryptsy, or (satoshi forbid), OUT of cryptsy? Do you have 200K dogecoins on cryptsy, another 30K in local storage, 500K in cold storage, etc. etc.? So there is a large time cost in transferring coins around that is difficult to value.
So for all these reasons and more our prices are not exact. And making them exact would require a lot more calculation on our part, like creating mock orders for all your coins, and asking exchanges what the fees would be on that trade, etc. etc. (sure, we can do this) but also a lot more personal information from you (where are these coins, exactly? how many in each wallet, exactly?) that didn't seem to be in the best interest of our users.
The original goals of Cointraq were twofold: to provide some transparency into what coins were worth (is it worth it do mine dogecoins? Are they worth a dollar each? A penny? Well, no, less than a tenth of a penny...contrast with 42coins), and also for users to record and see the aggregate value of their entire portfolio (can I retire yet? :P).
I think we have met those goals, and it's time to go further. I agree with you that we need to strive to be more transparent. We also need to ensure that we don't overstep the boundary we set for ourselves of having Cointraq be completely anonymous and safe to use. One of the things we need to go think about is how to take what information you're willing to give (say, where your coins are stored) and use that to give a better value. We'll keep working toward this goal.
Thanks for the honest feedback.
