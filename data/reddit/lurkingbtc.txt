I really love the Tails project :)

Really, it's not rocket science. I don't know why a youtube vid would be needed for this. If you want images check  for example (this was made before Electrum 2.X, but it really should be clear what to do).
Although it's just 2 screens: restore wallet from seed, select your wallet type (most probably standard wallet), and enter your seed. Encrypt your wallet with a password if you want. Done.

Hi from a long-time lurker but first-time poster.
Thanks for organising this!

Armory is a cold storage wallet (

Yes, Electrum will work for your needs. See  for some instructions.
@_date: 2016-06-21 15:32:56
Yes (obviously up to a certain degree).
See  and  for some rough idea.

Probably this is happening (again?)

But why are you saving private keys in text files?
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:38:49


This whole thing is so absurd. Gullible or ...?
@_date: 2016-05-29 18:49:38
Make sure the content of the text file is:


where &lt;privkey&gt; is your private key.
Then, you can safely change the extension of the text file to "key" to import it in Multibit.

Exactly, OP should read up on BIP38, for instance here:

Wallet -&gt; Seed -&gt; (enter encrypted wallet password) -&gt; ...

See  (and try it with a small amount first!).

Btw, IIRC, isn't it only when withdrawing from the vault it asks your passphrase (for the vault)?
