I'm pretty sure before paypal we had to trust our credit card info to the website retailer we were buying from.
I'm pretty sure before credit cards we had to do business with cash which we entrusted to retailers to fulfill a promised service.
I'm pretty sure what you are describing is easily resolved by third party services that will build up a reputation over time to allow secure transactions. What's stopping bitcoin from being transferred just as easily as using a debit card? Just get a card that transfers bitcoins.
People carrying around a house worth of bitcoins? Put it in a bank. Banking services will evolve to manage bitcoins. It will be much easier to handle and so whatever fees banks have will be less.

They are and the International Union of the Keepers of Time forbade the influencing of time when he was sent back from the future only to later allow subtle cues to what the future holds.

Tell her you don't invest money that you aren't prepared to lose. If that doesn't work tell her to use her own 401k and don't touch your shit. There's a good reason you have one and she doesn't. Then when you start arguing about how you're hurting her feelings you change the subject entirely and move onto something else.

I dunno...I think I'd prefer Craig Wright playing Charlie Sheen playing Craig Wright...can we do it that way instead?

Banks are run by normal people too.

Yes. A high school student should also know that the central banks primary function is the management of that very currency through monetary policy that includes the creation of that currency and how much is created.

Right, and I suppose large complex computer programs can be made on the first try without a single bug in it.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:16:57
Yeah, all that computing power is being used to give a viable alternative to all the wasted energy in operating central banks.
@_date: 2013-10-07 22:06:03
No, central banks influence the value of currency. Foreign exchange markets facilitate trade between currencies. People decide what a currency is worth.

I only use that email address for job interviews though. Emails aren't searchable otherwise they would become useless spam magnets. So the spammers help protect my privacy :D

By your logic we will also eventually use nuclear weapons to destroy ourselves. And to save you saying, "Isn't it obvious?" We still have to advance and improve the technology because it has more potential for good than it does for bad.

It's not always that easy to cover your tracks and, yes, sometimes that means you miss something very basic. That's okay because it allows us to maintain a balance in all things good and bad.

So everyone buys and sells bitcoins and no one uses it to actually exchange real goods? That's like buying paper money to sell it for a price that may be higher or lower than its face value. Do you not see how that would make a currency worthless?
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:07:33
Because they are? And the public is taking it the wrong way? Hence PR?

We all used our real name as our gmail addresses when we started using gmail. Have you tried to delete that shit? Google never forgets.
I see your point though.

Teenager who just learned how to read. Well done. I used to think like you. After you sort through life's complexities and stop letting information manipulate you, you should turn out okay.
@_date: 2013-07-08 14:57:36
Agreed.

They invented the predecessor to Facebook. Zuckerburg stole their ideas. They still got return on their investment ideas after suing. Use half a brain buddy! They know a good investment when they see one.

Why do you think there will be another bubble? What would trigger it in the summer?

Morons like you are why it's so hard to fund our accounts in the first place.

Yeh, I was actually kind of surprised at comments on reddit about how this guy could have avoided getting caught. In [my original comment]( I did, however, say that, "That's okay because it allows us to maintain a balance in all things good and bad." I was hinting at the fact that it's good that bad guys slip up from time to time so that we catch them and take down their empire.
@_date: 2013-10-08 05:08:53
Central banks don't buy and sell money. You are beyond being a fucking idiot. Don't expect me to respond to any future comments you make.

Hmmm, this post may have pissed off someone enough to start attempting to make the first counterfeit bitcoin.

Then, when you get out of jail you realize an error you made in your script caused the coins to be distributed among millions of accounts that would take years to consolidate!

I guess someone is waiting for all those new users who made a My Wallet account this weekend to have their funds cleared and start buying in this week. Cause another bubble this week and a crash by the weekend.

If I have to do all this to safeguard my virtual currency I don't see bitcoin taking off as an alternative to real money. :(

You shouldn't be selling your bitcoin you noob you're supposed to be using it to buy goods.
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:09:37
You don't have to spend them but the value of bitcoins will not always go up. We don't know what the market has in store for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:02:45
Or just give your bitcoin wallet address and hoard all the bitcoins you make from sales.

Even though we are not entitled, a bank would cease to function with no bank accounts.
