yes but if we all try to set the same price, somebody will want to get in ahead of everyone else to sell their coins.
Ford, toyota, honda, etc could all set their car prices to $100k, but then eventually somebody would want an edge and would go to $99k, so on and so forth.
The invisible hand works pretty good...

you must not have zbar installed.  Did you get the version from  ? 
perhaps try a reboot after installing.

the capitulation part has too much or a drop in your image.  Despair is never lower than take off, and is usually like 4-5X take off.

no, I haven't gotten any sent to any address, and they all have more than 0.3

you must be looking at the wrong price, it has only gone down about $100 in two days.

I caught a falling knife all through last june and into july last year.  I don't regret it.

you are wrong

I just tried to subscribe but all I see are credit cards for options.

that doesn't sound quite gamey enough.

zbar.  Electrum has zbar integration, but you can use it with any client.

no, the 30 week ema is $554 right now on bitstamp.
looking at a weekly scale makes the news almost seem like news has no effect on the price, this had to happen anyway to complete the bubble - just look at the last one three months after the peak.
Of course I don't really know what I am talking about, but it feels like there might be some truthiness to it.  I buy as much as I can around the 30 week ema.
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:23:29
did you enable it in the preferances?
I have electrum on both windows and linux, both with zbar working.

I agree with $550, though maybe a bit lower.  There have been very few opportunities in the last year to buy bitcoins under the 30 week ema.  Only last july (3 months after the april bubble) and the silk road bust but that one was unexpected.
The 30 week ema is where I try to buy as many as I can.
