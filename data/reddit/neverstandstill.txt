Things that will kill the cryptocurrency market:  7-10 day wait for ACH transfers (fuck all of this) and high fees.  People are getting greedy and you can feel the tension starting to rise up.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:06:17
Yeah, realistically ACH should never take more than 3 to 4 days.  I've worked in payment processing engines and the turnaround is much quicker than people think.  I don't know why Coinbase is holding my money (other than to make money off interest) but one would think they would want to free up my money and collect more fees from me.  Idk.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:07:55
Agreed.  I look forward to cryptocurrency catching up and settling down (market wise) so that it can become an accepted currency.  It's acceptable to fluctuate a few points here and there...but these crazy spikes and dips are going to keep it from being viable.

Sigh.  Thanks...blows my mind.  I moved a ton of money there to buy LTC while it was 126...FML
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:59:57
Also, sorry but I'm more of a dog person ;)
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:23:08
Very informative.  Thank you for this.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:20:32
ha, you cash it in for USD...that's how you transact with it.  
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:58:10
Unbelievable.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:11:49
I'm just holding onto my money until Monday...if it tanks, I'll scoop some up...if it soars, I'll buy as quick as possible and sell when I've hit my targeted return.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:26:52
Personally, I think you're going to see LTC rise like crazy over the next few months.  It's better than bitcoin without all the public spotlight and extremely undervalued at the moment.  That being said, this is not investment advice - just my opinion.  
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:10:58
Totally unacceptable.  This is 2017 right?
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:51:06
Just speculation...but I think you're going to see a lot of crypto's die off in the next year.  The "winners" will be limited to a few...each have their own purpose...Ether is completely different from BTC/LTC so maybe all 3 will rise up.  Idk.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:17:18
Yeah, I didn't initiate a purchase...I initiated a money transfer.  Moving funds from bank account to Coinbase wallet.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:26:17
When will the next purge be...20k?  19k?
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:24:30
2) Think of gold and silver.  Bitcoin being gold and silver being litecoin.  There are 4x as many litcoins as there are bitcoins.  Litcoin, however, is technically better than bitcoin at the moment (faster, cheaper, etc) but extremely undervalued compared to bitcoin.  There are some people out there that argue litecoin should be valued at 1/4 the value of bitcoin - but that remains to be seen.  
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:02:36
Yeah...the problem is I've already initiated the movement...so my money is literally just sitting somewhere waiting to be release.  I understanding "processing time" but it's been 48 business hours since they've processed it on my side...so wtf
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:11:27
If they don't get something figured out people are going to start searching for an exchange that doesn't hold their funds for that long.  Just my opinion.  I'll be looking...
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:05:45
Also one would think they would want to get me money ASAP so they can start making fees off of me.  
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:00:19
Idk man...I'm just hoping I get my money before the next big drop so I can take advantage.  I already lost out on the LTC going from 126 to 380.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:42:44
I think it’ll be the same. Bitcoin is extremely overbought / overvalued at the moment and a huge correction is needed.  That said, now that people are starting to see it as an investment, maybe I’ll become more accepted. Again though, that takes time.  Long term looks promising for bitcoin, but as of now everyone is just gambling.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:09:00
my prediction: 
1) a few days, maybe even a week of this up-a-bit down-a-bit market
2) followed by a significant drop
3) prices will stay lower for a bit because now people will start buying bitcoin to mimic what investors do
4) investors are willing to invest but all real money will be kept out until bitcoin (and other cryptocurriences) are adopted - right now the exchanges are too crazy to make it a viable currency
5)  the markets will settle down, people will invest in solutions that accept cryptos and then the market will start to go up
6)  this takes a while...so HODL
