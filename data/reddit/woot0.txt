noob question. How would you keep it secure?

If she actually was getting death threats, they would notify the authorities. In CA as in most states, a death threat is classified as a misdemeanor and punishable by up to a year in prison.  He makes no mention of contacting the police or FBI, which strikes me as odd.

Is there anyway to do a version for Facebook down the line? Btw, I deeply prefer Twitter over FB, but I think a FB integration would be huge. Also, congrats on a great product.

as I posted above, I'm just a little skeptical about these death threats. Death threats are illegal, and can lead to time in prison depending on the state and the circumstances.  Impoco makes no mention of contacting the local authorities or FBI. As an editor, he must know that *should* be his first call and that he should talk openly about the involvement of LE now. Maybe I'm offbase but seems very odd, certainly not "text book."

I think the app violated TOS. Having said that - these sorts of protests make headlines and a statement (Apple = bad, no longer cool). Apple has spent an unfathomable amount of money, energy and skill making its "brand" the best in the world. People aren't just smashing a phone, they are smashing "the brand." That's actually a big problem, especially with Steve/Jesus gone.  Shareholders are worried Apple won't be cool with him gone. Seeing kids on YouTube shoot Apple phones with assault rifles doesn't help. The reasoning behind the protests is silly, but the actual protest is highly impactful.

Personally I would buy and hold Bitcoin, which is what I've done actually. And then store it in a paper wallet secured in a bank safety deposit box and go live your life. Then revisit it in a couple years.
If you don't want to do that, I would look at building a startup that makes user adoption easier.  My 2 cents, I think the biggest problem facing digital currency is that only a handful of redditors actually understand it.  Even the NY fucking Times has printed grossly erroneous information.  This startup could basically be an easier way to purchase BTC and store them for non-tech saavy people. Build something mom can use.
Me personally, I would just HODL.

a financial advisor may try to sell him on financial products, which the FA could get a kickback in.  Honestly, anyone OP encounters will have their own interests at heart. Something for OP to consider.

yeah, this, I loaned a guy I worked with a substantial amount of money. Very unusual for me, but I know the guy. He's married, got kids, really talented at his job. Just was in a bad situation.  He paid me back a month later, thanked me, and we never mentioned it again.  It's all about the person's character.
