You're wrong because every time someone sells btc someone else has to buy it that's how markets work, you're delusional if you think this market is gonna crash to zero lol

He's talking bout the technology itself maybe not bitcoin but block chain and decentralization is going to change the world. 
This guy probably works at a bank.

I also bought at 15.5 don't feel bad though bitcoin is the future it is not meant for day to day transactions more as a store of value

The market is still new, majority of the coins dont even have 6 month lifespans I have 10 picks right now all under .50 cents. Anyone can easily invest a couple hundred dollars and In a sense train yourself to learn how to time the markets and ride the wave, don't just completely shut it down because you don't understand it that's ignorance at its finest.

Or you can stop being lazy and learn how to day trade 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:22:09
If you are disciplined in your stop losses and win 50% of your trades, you're going to make money, there are tons of people who does this for a living we aren't walking on water or building rockets lol. It's not impossible to be profitable day trading is all I'm saying.

When you believe in a project or coin you buy the dip and accumulate, so you are in a sense hodling but you're also buying the dip and selling maybe 30-40 percent of your position along the way  until you reached your goal while also "hodling" a core position. there are plenty of videos on YouTube for basic day traders to start learning. Yeah you can hodl but you can grow your account exponentially and learn along the way also the market is soooo fresh there's soooo much interest.  if you only knew how many investors and traders are flocking to crypto currencies, just look at how much volume has entered into the markets and all these really cheap coins are getting bought up don't get left behind my friend, take my advice and take the time out to learn and build strategy, everyone can learn . My top picks are verge, cardano, digital note and reddcoin. Hope this helps you young grasshopper ;)

Yes because learning something new is bad advice. Please don't reproduce.
