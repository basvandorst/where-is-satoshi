6 trades so far, good experience so far. Problems with one order, not caused by earner, nor purse.io, but the shop itself, but solved at the end to satisfaction of all sides, just took longer than expected. Good saves everytime, although my main point of disappointment was when I wanted to go really cheap just to realize that almost everything then goes to purse.io fees. This means that if you ask for 15 %, they tak very little, if you ask for 30 % they tak much more, and if you ask for 50 % discount, they take 15 %, so your final discount is not 50 % as you would expect, but cca 35 %. But except for that, it is TOTALLY AWESOME.

Thanks, the primary thing for me is to be able to buy BTC for myself. What I was afraid of is that if I send money to a known BTC entity like Bitstamp or alike, the bank will know I am sending money to BTC business and this may cause problems. This is why I am really looking for someone with real life experience.

This sounds reasonable. Any ideas on how high are currency exchange (GBP to EUR) fees there? 
@_date: 2015-12-29 09:46:10
Today, I have learned about uphold.com. If all the information provided on their web is true, this sounds like an ultimate way to get BTC from GBP. Can anyone confirm that? 
According to their web, once you are a verified member, which is free, you can send GBP from your bank to them for free and then convert to BTC for free again. Their market price is a real market price - i.e. it is the same price as I can see on BTC-e or Bitstamp. 
There are limits, but for me those limits are perfectly fine (like free to withdraw up to 5 BTC per month). 
The only question is - is it not too good to be true?

That would be weird :-) I bet I am not the only one, currently I can see only 30 nodes online with this, so let's see...
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:04:56
I don't think there is a single correct view of the network state. Each node might have different list of transactions in the mempool at a given time. But overall, the numbers should +- match. It feels weird when a site recommends 220 s/b and the last mined blocks contain 26 s/b.
@_date: 2017-02-07 12:41:05
There is absolutely nothing misleading. I have paid 0.03 %. Do you have different use case? OK, it might not apply to you. But for me, making my transfer, it worked as described and I am not aware of any other way to make the transfer more effective.
I explicitly say that even if it does not solve every use case on the planet, it is a really great thing to have.
@_date: 2017-03-30 07:52:24
OK, so then you know about the risks and you are hoping for the wide support so that the risk are minimized. That is probably a valid strategy, although I am not a fan of it. What I see as a greatest risk is that ppl will really go for it and start deploying UASF. The problem is you are not going to get them all and not even those that would agree with that idea because the timeframe is very short. You need maybe a year of time if you want ppl to update. So you will end with something like 70 % of the network updated at best and cutting off e.g. 30 % possibly with many users behind those nodes ...

@_date: 2017-03-29 12:12:02
I mostly agree with what you say. I just do not agree on the conclusion that it is OK for us to force someone to SW. They force us to BU and we do not like it, why is it OK if it is vice versa?
I am all for LN because I understand how it works on the technical level. It is the solution. However, one should understand that devs did not put 95 % activation level on SW for nothing. They wanted superwide consensus. SW and LN and all the improvements are way to go, but possibly not for any cost.
Maybe SW will never get activated, so someone will surely create a similar proposal after that period. Yes, it will take more time than necessary, but it would be done the right way.
If we are talking about BIP148, what happens if just 50 % of nodes upgrade? That could be equally as bad if we have BU hardfork.
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:30:21
SegWit is very well tested. This approach to force such a big feature is not. To me, this is somehow dangerous. However, I do not really believe that BIP148 will be a success. I expect about 5 % of nodes to fork of on themselves, creating a little mess on the network. Should it be more than 5 %, it could be really dangerous.
If SegWit is not activated, so be it. We will find a way.
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:30:07
Yes and no. 
Yes - If you have multiple implementations and each has a significant market share, then a bug in one would not affect others.
No - If you have multiple implementations, it means that you will need many times more people doing quality code and reviews. Instead you could have one that all these people are working on together, thus likely producing much better quality product that will just work.
In my opinion, if you go with multiple implementations, you are likely to see quite many bugs in most of them every so often (we can somehow see this in Ethereum, which does have multiple implementations). I'd go for single extremely reviewed implementation.
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:44:05
I don't think I am missing that. I am well aware of what BU is and for me it is anti-Bitcoin in almost every aspect.
But this does not mean that a similar anti-Bitcoin approach from another group is somehow better.
BIP148 is simply not how we deploy in bitcoin. Where are months of tests of this BIP? Where are analyzes of all possible risks? etc.

This is one of the biggest misunderstanding thinking about developers of Bitcoin Core projects as a SINGLE (centralized) group of people. 
This can't be much further from the reality. Bitcoin Classic, XT, Unlimited? Maybe those have centralized "SINGLE" groups of developers. 
Bitcoin Core is an open project that anyone can contribute to and they do. Did some of those guys form a company that can be considered as a centralization point? Yes, they did. Still, the level of decentralization of the whole Bitcoin Core project is many times better than in other variants. 
There is no single entity coding Bitcoin Core. There is not a single person who could make a proposal of whatever and it would be guaranteed to be implemented in actual Bitcoin Core. This is simply not true.
So despite what you say ppl can't do: One of the greatest values in Bitcoin are decentralization and incredible developers.
@_date: 2017-03-30 07:59:01
Thinking about it ... yes, probably UASF in general (and especially this one or any other one deploying nontrivial and somewhat controversial change in impossibly short time frame). 
Should miners rule us? No and they even can't. They can destroy bitcoin, however. From day one you know 51 % attack is the  attack in bitcoin and with that risk you went for it. It does not mean you will be forced to use something you do not want to, but it may mean you won't be able to use something you would like to. That is the fundamental think in Bitcoin. Yes, you can fork off then and use whatever you want without those miners (there are many ways how to do that including change of PoW alg), but this is not a big win for you. At that point Bitcoin is effectively destroyed and possibly Bitcoin 2.0 is starting. But you lose many many users and value here, so it is like jumping 6 years backwards. Not a win in my opinion.

I don't really understand how that page operates. If I look now to  I can see 3150, which is two blocks to clear completely. And last block mined is now this one  and about a half of transactions in that block is less than 120 satoshi/byte. So 220 satoshi/byte seems a bit high to me.
And before I just hit "save", another block was found and transactions with as low as 26 s/b (and many many below 50 s/b) were mined ... 2500 unconfirmed left right now according blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:54:13

@_date: 2017-03-28 12:26:04
This is really wrong information you have. It maybe needs a little more time from you to understand it, but if you are willing to invest that time, try reading this: 
In short
- SW is all on-chain, there is no off-chain part
- data on-chain are no longer being viewed as all equal, but a certain part (witness) is separated
- the non-witness part is still limited to 1 MB
- the total maximum size of on-chain data is no longer 1 MB but 4 MB (yes, 4 MB on-chain)
- in real world (which is the view considering the current types of transactions in bitcoin), the actual throughput would be increased somewhere between 2.1 MB and 2.3 MB, that are the somehow current estimates (i.e. SW would have a similar effect on the throughput as increasing the blocksize hard limit to 2.1 MB, not counting any 2nd layer solutions)
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:16:24
So, first of all


you probably did not want to include that in your post as you basically agreed this is true. If not, please explicitly say again, but I think we could agree that the there are many people that can contribute the code.


I do not really see why would you say this is not true. Could you possibly show us an example of a code that a single person (whoever you think is that one that can suggest ANYTHING and it will HAVE TO be released) suggested and it was not reviewed as everything else according to  document? Please show one ore more examples (if you think there is such a person, there probably should be many examples of his pull requests that were just merged without any review process or anything like that). 
If I would like to try to take your side of argument, I think you wanted to say that despite anyone can propose any new code, at the very end it is Wladimir van der Laan, the Chief Maintainer of Bitcoin Core, that will have to press that button in order to merge that code into the release. So this might be the centralized point that you are talking about, is it? If it is, could you please give us an example of how Wladimir went against "just being the robot and presses that button if (and only if) all contributing (see the document link above) requirements are met"? 
So, please be very specific about what you are talking about, please give us examples. If you are right and there are such examples, I am very interested to see those because so far I trusted this contributing process and if what you say is right (and I'm wrong) then it is very bad and I want to know, I have money invested. I'm serious.
BTW, are you aware that according to Bitcoin wiki -  


So just to say this guy is not Blockstream, if it matters to you (some people don't like Blockstream).
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:18:25
It is dangerous and untested software. There was a bug fixed recently. There are just a few lines of code and still they were buggy. This feels like BU quality of code. 
This is not how you deploy into Bitcoin. In Bitcoin, you first go for reviews, then you fix the bugs that were revealed, then you go to testnet and test extensively all possible scenarios, then you fix the bugs that were revealed, then you test again and get more reviews. And only once you are sure that your code is safe, you build it for production. 
Why is it dangerous? Some of the problems are mentioned in 
Basically, it can go very wrong and that is why it is very reasonable to expect that many full nodes will not upgrade to this. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 07:48:49
I meant all nodes, including nodes of miners (those are very important nodes). Another group of very important nodes are nodes of big companies and exchanges. There are probably many different group of nodes, some more important than other. So say we've got 50 % upgrade in each of the group. What then? 
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:45:01
Sorry, you are now changing the topic. To recap that - I was criticizing the comment that suggested that developers of Bitcoin Core were somehow under the rule of one guy or tiny group of ppl, who could push whatever they wanted to the release, thus making the development very centralized (compared to other project). I argued that actually this is very decentralized development. 
Then you followed by marking that statement of mine that there is not a single person who could make a proposal and it would go no matter how bad that proposal would be. So we somehow agree now that this is not really the case. So I think (I hope you agree) that there was not actually anything false in what I said.
As for the new topic you turned into - I do not need to trust Wladimir and I do not need to trust his future replacement. Why? Because: 
* the code is public, if I do not want to trust binaries, I have the option;
* I can review what Wladimir did merge and what he did not and I can decide myself if he followed the contribution policy or not; if yes, there is no trust, he simply followed the policy, being "the robot"; if no, I can point that up to the developers and if I am right they will create another project on Github and they will get rid of Wladimir; once bad Wladimir is gone, the very same thing will be true for the one who is next on his position
* it does not matter who controls bitcoin.org or  that is just one website and one repository (yes, well established, trusted by most etc. but certainly NOT irreplaceable); because if developers (those many decentralized developers that care about bitcoin and know bitcoin extremely well, not just the part that is grouped in a single company, all of them) see that Wladimir (or anyone in his position) violated the contribution rules, that person will immediately lose their respect and their trust and they will replace him
But to be absolutely honest, I do no think Wladimir will misbehave. I do trust him, but I DO NOT NEED TO. I do trust the whole group of the developers and reviewers together, not a single person there particularly (I think everyone there is just a human that can make an error, but together they are very strong) and unless you or anyone else could prove that those policies are violated, that there is a single person (or two or three) in control such that regardless of what all other say in their reviews, their opinions will be released, then I do not see why you criticize this development process. 
And to be honest, is there any other better option? Do you have better development policies for such a project that you could propose that would replace this? Do you have any other group of people that would work together so well? Maybe there are some better groups in some private companies out there - Google, Microsoft, SAP? I don't know. But even IF, those people are not available. So this is the best group of ppl I know for this task. Do you have anything better? 
BTW, I am sure that if you were able to propose a good improvement on their development policies, they will review it and will merge it. See bitcoin-dev mailing list for the very recent suggestion for new process of presenting BIPs. Anyone can suggest improvement even in the development process itself. That is how much open this development is.

It is actually a contradiction, if you value Bitcoin for the fact that it is hard to modify it and make incompatible changes. New POW is a crazy level of change that would completely cause a lost of trust in many of Bitcoin supporters.

Without state people would care about each other much more. They don't do it now because, you know, that's the state's job. Charities would play much greater role in the society. Families as well. You are disabled, children would take care of you. Don't have? Charity would. 
The society is crippled by the state.
Military is little more complex question, but currently, at least in EU (not sure where are you from), the situation is that people are forbidden to be armed. It is so easy to attack such society. It would be much more difficult to attack society that is fully armed.

It is important to distinguish between people who don't have money by choice and those that don't have money due to unfortunate circumstances. 
For the first group - their problem, don't want to work, don't use.
For the second group - a lot is very cheap and near free (various online courses to provide education), then there are charities caring a lot about exactly this group of people.
Taxes are an instrument on how to pay a lot for mostly what you don't want and the little that you want could cost much less. This includes roads, safety, education.

does not include Segwit, which also plays role, so not ultimate ;)
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:46:25
The harm was discussed many times. Segwit does increase blocksize. In theory up to some ~3.7 MB, in real world currently to something like 2.2 MB. So that is a good step towards blocksize increase. Segwit2x allows you to get over 7MB blocks. That is not considered safe by a lot of people - even by those that agree that block size limit may need to be increased in the future (that includes myself).
The main problem with the solution like 2x is the hardfork part. You can't do hardfork in 3-6 months. I have not hear from everyone who understands it that it could be possible to do safe HF in less than 18 months. So how could Segwit2x be the right way to go? Even if &gt;7MB blocks were safe for the network from resource consumption perspective, it is not safe from the deployment perspective - you need 18+ months for a safe HF, that's basically the consensus among top developers. Segwit2x is crazy on time and such a quick deployment does not have any merit.
So as step 1 in blocksize increase you have SW itself. This allows you to implement more optimizations in near future and this all combined gives you enough time for 18+ month hardfork plan.

First, it is quite hard to imagine that people would live in such a city. Why would anyone buy a house in such a controlled environment? If there are few people, what is there for Evil Corp to take advantage of them if they have no money, no resources? Why wouldn't another company existed to provide better services in the area before Evil Corp has everything under control? Why would another company not start to exist once the Evil Corp abused their power?
Those scenarios you are picturing don't make much sense. They assume very stupid people and unclear incentives for the Evil Corp to just terrorize them. OK, still can happen, there are stupid people and there are sick people who like terror, but would that be something less rare than today's cases of the same in whatever undeveloped country?

Not at all. Don't imagine stupid solutions like having a cashier at the end of each road. You could have subscriptions (just as you do now in many countries if you want to use highways) and all that stuff. Very simply. 
Actually many countries do employ vehicle tracking systems that are very expensive and could be done much cheaper if in private sector.

@_date: 2017-08-03 10:04:49
Again, many things that can be said (repeated). So I just go with one simplest thing to explain why this is not as trivial as it looks. 
So you say - let's have max block weight not 4 MB but 8 MB. OK, but how about quadratic hashing problem? Currently there is no limit on transaction size (other than that it must fit to a single block). So suddenly you would allow a transaction that is 2 MB by itself. This is a killer because suddenly you opened (or rather made very much wider) DOS attack vector. 
So do you solve this or not? If you want to stand with your "simple hard fork increasing" then you don't. Then the network can be attacked. Similarly replay protection (very much needed for superfast hardfork). Again, do you solve it? Suddenly your "simple hard fork" is not that simple anymore, or you made it very insecure.
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:39:51
Maybe an analogy will help. It is not a perfect one and there some incorrect assumptions, but still, might help.
So let's assume I'm against 21M hard limit because there is a problem that all the time coins are lost forever (people die etc). So I say to solve this problem we must raise the limit - e.g. to 42M, that would be nice. And some people say no, the limit is fine. I say, you they bad, they need to compromise - so I suggest as a compromise "to raise the limit just a little bit - say 25M".
So some other people say - let's break the limit by allowing to remine those coins that are provably unspendable (burnt).  And let's assume this can be done by soft fork (and let's assume raising to 42 or 25 is HF).
Analogy is:
- coin limit ~ blocksize limit
- proposal to raise to 25M ~ "compromise" Segwit2x (HF)
- proposal to allow remine of provably unspendable coins ~ Segwit (SF)
Now maybe you can see that raising the limit to 25M HF won't actually solve anything more (asymptotically) than the SF variant. And due to HF, it is much more dangerous to do. And the benefits of that simple do not justify the small gain.
So as you might see now, the "compromise" here is not a compromise at all, it is basically what I wanted, not what other people wanted (keep the limit). I am just lowering my original parameters to be able to call this "compromise".

Go, ask Matt yourself. If you have a deep conversation with him and you will still want HF, then OK, but otherwise I don't really believe you know what you are talking about. "Stalling tactic" - that's really not backed by anything. You just try to find something without actually talking to those people.

That's another thing - having HF just for block size increase does not make any sense. That should be a very long planned event and thus a great opportunity to fix some great problems.
But I don't need to repeat these arguments - please read them here 
You say you are huge fan of the Core team - but it seems like you know better than them. If you do, why you don't react to that discussion on the mailing list. If you can support what you say with solid arguments, you will be listened to.
In that single message you see all sort of problems being mentioned. Some are specific to the proposal being discussed, some are more general to every hardfork. Are you familiar with those arguments and you still think they convinced themselves to this incorrectly?
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:27:33
Not at all again. If private companies makes agreements with each other allowing an universal ticket to be used for many streets of many companies, you can have easy of use. 
And any opt-in structure is very different from forced taxes. With taxes, you are still paying for road that you will never ever use, instead of contributing to maintenance of those that you actually want to use. 
Taxes are so ineffective, that without them (in longterm), you could have everything you have now for half price and without any forcing.
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:20:03
If it has merit then you can perhaps answer my (honest) question below (to explain how Segwit itself fails to do it and Segwit2x succeeds).
As for the feelings - well some people strongly feel that hard limit of &lt;21M coins is not good. And other people strongly feel about some other properties. This means that at no point everyone will be satisfied.
But you are suggesting - "tear each other down" - that the pure meritocracy is somehow hostile. It is not. It is hostile towards you only if you don't have good enough arguments for the feature you are proposing. If you don't have enough arguments, data, merit, and thus you are unable to convince other people about it, you should not feel as this is personal attack against you. It is your failure, but nothing personal.
This has nothing to do with cooperation or non-cooperation. If it has merit, people cooperate on implementing that. If it has not, this does not mean there is no cooperation. Suggesting otherwise is very unprofessional approach. 
Again using words like "intransigent" means complete misunderstanding of what is needed. Intransigent about what? About things that have merit or about things that do not have merit? If someone is AGAINST something that HAS merit regardless of the data and arguments, then yes, that is bad. But if someone is AGAINST something that HAS NO merit, then no, that is not bad.

Thins are moving fast here. Within couple of hours, you can easily go from 3k unconfirmed transactions to 30k, then the difference in the fees is big. But as long as you look for information before you make a transaction, you have a very good chance to make the right choice (providing that your wallet does not do that for you already, which is optimal).
@_date: 2017-04-30 17:42:08
Just use better software or make your research before sending such a high fee. Actually there is no need to. This is the last block as of this moment - 
You can see more than half of the transactions mined there are below 125 sat/B. You would pay less than 0.4 USD if your transaction was common 225 bytes transaction. If it was larger, you could pay maybe 1 USD, certainly not 6 USD, unless the transaction was kind of rare monster that would clear bunch of your UTXOs, in which case you should consider that fee as an aggregate fee.

I'm very pro-SegWit, yet I'm against UASF SegWit as it has been presented. Why? Because this is not how you deploy changes in Bitcoin. Why? Because UASF SegWit as it has been presented is too fast. 
Every such a change should be peer reviewed to extreme, this was not. Then it should be tested like crazy, this was not. Then tested like crazy on testnet, this was not. And during this process of endless testing and review bugs would be found. They would be fixed and the whole process of testing would start over again. This did not happen here. This is not how you deploy changes in Bitcoin.
And especially with changes that require a huge number of people to cooperate together (i.e. upgrade) need very long activation time, not just couple of months like we see here. This quick activation is why this is doomed. Many people will simply not upgrade on time. There are many different reasons for that. 
How about backports for example? I'm not sure about that, but is there a backport of UASF SegWit to all versions of Bitcoin Core that are relevant? Or do we force everyone to jump to v0.14? This might be a problem if we do ...
If there is super wide consensus of users, then UASF might make sense, but only if you make it right, not in hurry.
@_date: 2017-04-14 18:53:42
Probably depends on how you define pushing. In my point of view, if I compare SW to BU, then if something is pushed, it is BU, not SW. If you, however, define pushing as providing valid arguments and defending why SW is the best currently available solution, then OK, they are pushing... But their lack of will to code anything worse than SW is not pushing SW, it is just the best they know is there and there is no why to code anything worse than that. I don't call this pushing.

I agree with you here except that part about trivial code. Once you touch consensus, nothing is trivial enough. Maybe even more than the bug, I am completely missing a deep analysis of impacts of BIP 148 being deployed. There should be each possible scenario analyzed and described. It should also have months of testing on testnet to confirm those analyses.
@_date: 2017-04-30 12:01:27
OK, I was not sure what you mean when you say people. You don't actually mean all people, just some of them that run nodes. You still leave 99.999 % of users out of the suggested voting. Not saying that it is a good idea, however. Just was not sure about what did you mean.
OK, so let's vote for HF, how long will that vote take? What should be HF parameters? New block size? Time for upgrade (after vote is completed)? One-time increase or increase every X months? How many % of votes to accept the network is ready? Is this just yes or no, or do you allow voter to set (maximal?) parameters?
@_date: 2017-04-25 13:30:07
Yes, BIP148 implementation of UASF is the most dangerous of the available options that can result in quite a lot of different scenarios. These scenarios need to be described and analyzed before we should even think about using something like BIP148 in production.

Which is perfectly fine, if you ask me. There is SW SF proposal that is to be signalled by miners. It will get activated or it won't get activated. If it won't and we still then feel SW is a good proposal (which I think most the community will feel), then we can try to propose another option of its activation, possibly by UASF, but doing that properly, after enough research and enough testing.

I am against SW UASF (also known as BIP 148). As Greg described in his post, UASF is nothing new in general and he is also against this specific SW UASF, not UASF in general.
The reason not to support it is that it is rushed and does not have the same quality (i.e. lots of research and testing required before deployment) as other things that are being deployed in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-15 08:36:35
So you say the current signaling by miners is the only way to measure support. That is obviously not true, you probably know it and then I don't what is your intention to say so. 
If you honestly do not know it, check  for example. This says that there was a lot of effort being done by a lot of companies and individuals and open source projects to support SW, so they are PRO SW (37 %). If they want to remain neutral they just say "Ready" if they are ready (another 35 %). So in total you have 72 % of projects either explicitly PRO SW or made an effort to become Ready. 4 % are actually against. Now how is this for BU? You can see it there. You want to call this farts and Sybil attacks? OK, no point to spend more time talking to you.
You make claim that you can't support with anything like "massive support for HF of SW", that's just what you made up. Show me data, otherwise just FUD.
@_date: 2017-04-14 14:28:24
I also want SegWit, I agree with you on that. But developers expressed several times that they are not community leaders or in position to dictate anything. They create solutions, it is not really their job to push anything. They can give you and others analyses of why they coded what they coded. 
It is the role of the community to push it. People like Andreas Antonopoulos are those who do this hard job. Sadly there are not enough of them. We need more of those, but developers did their job here very well. 
@_date: 2017-04-30 07:12:41
So, if I understand you well, it is not possible to check the claim of the node about its degree. However, this might not be a great problem if we instead have a default settings of the node software to pick their channel peers randomly. 
I'm not sure what you strategy is here for the node admins, whether you expect either manual channel construction, or automatic channel construction that is based on the actual need of making a transaction, or something else. If you rely on manual channel construction, this will probably lead to high degree nodes aka "hubs". If you rely on automatic construction based on actual need of making the transaction, this will also likely lead to "hubs". But if each node by default initiated a few channels on a random basis, this would likely lowered the "hubness" (just found out it is a word, wow) of the network.
What do you think and what strategies do you use or expect in node software by default?
@_date: 2017-04-12 10:04:20

@_date: 2017-04-18 13:26:59
I think that is the problem. There are hundreds of ideas such as Decred, but nothing is tested so far. It will take years maybe decades to test ideas like that. In Bitcoin, you don't just randomly pick up an idea and put it there and see what happens, even if you think the idea is good. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 13:55:32
Yeah, absolutely. We could see attempts for such analyses here and there on Reddit and elsewhere, but nothing complete enough. Possibly we do not need as much as we have for SegWit, but still, I would not say that BIP148 is something trivial. 
And yes, you do not know what each actor would do, but you can predict their options and analyze those scenarios, estimate their likelihoods, look for incentives etc. 
So thinking like couple of months will be enough for this to make all the analyses AND convince enough players to join BIP148 on time, that feels unreal.

That is just drama and feelings driven. I understand your concerns about certain entities being malicious to Bitcoin. Why don't we like BU? Because it is rushed, buggy, incompetent and highly untested solution. The answer is not to lower our standards towards levels of BU devs. 
When it is rushed, it is rushed, regardless how good or poor the proposal is. If there is not enough time and only 30-50 % of nodes upgrade, the network will be in big troubles because one group of nodes will ban the other group, but the other group will still be legitimate and very strong. It would be insane situation.
@_date: 2017-04-14 13:30:19
In Bitcoin, the deployment is not done without extensive research and insane level of testing. In BIP 148 you have August 1st without any of this. This is not how you deploy in Bitcoin.
First, you make an extensive research and you have it extensively peer reviewed. Then if it seems there might be a good one, you make a proposal, then you have it extensively peer reviewed, then you fix your proposal accordingly. Then you implement it and then you have the code peer reviewed. Then you fix the code. Then you test it extensively. Then you fix the code. Then you have it peer reviewed again and then you have it tested again. And then and only then it is ready to be deployed. But still, you need to allow very long time for everyone to upgrade, not just couple of months.
But not that one day you wake up and see low number of signalling miners and say "Hey, we probably won't make it on time with this kind of signalling, how about we quickly change the process of activation and let's give everyone just couple of months to migrate. Then you code something and people start using it and then it is found that it is buggy..."
@_date: 2017-04-30 06:36:14
I just put there those last sentences to show you how weird will it sound to you to just claim something without backing it up. Yet I don't need to call you stupid or childish to express my opinion.
The argument of 10000 years of history is not very strong because of new tech progress that enables new things today. We did not have Internet 1000 years ago, so obviously we can't have Internet-enabled solution evolved completely. How about digital money solutions and trustless and decentralized systems? How old is this area? That "history" argument is thus weak.
It is only now that people are more interested in looking into new solutions because the technology enables them to. They can communicate fast today, developing new ideas and they can use advanced cryptography and math concepts to implement those ideas. What was true 20 years ago is no longer valid on this field. 
It will obviously take a long time for the transformation to happen, but that does not mean that taxes are needed. For every scenario that relies on taxation there is counter scenario how to do it without stealing from people under the threat of punishment. We can do better than that and the future will show if we succeed to do better than that or if we remain under the tyranny. BTW, the tyranny is the current state. I'm not sure where are you from, but if you were from Europe, you might be able to see it. If you are from US, your taxes are on somehow manageable level. In most of EU countries, the state takes more than 80 % of what you earn. If that is not a tyranny for you, hardly anything is.
@_date: 2017-04-30 14:49:58
Show me your math then. I might rather underestimated those amounts in some cases. I do agree that those % are not from the same number, so the simple + is incorrect (so I've fixed my previous post to reflect that), so it grows not that fast as I suggested, but the end result will still be around 80 %.
In your example, the individual makes 100k, but will never see them and from the part he sees in his account will pay more taxes on whatever he buys with it. It adds up. Show me your math.
Or maybe do not show me your math, but rather tell me the result you would expected and what on level you would still consider it OK level of taxation.

Not sure why are you confused. How about setting the deadline tomorrow? Why not? Because it is not enough time for many ppl to upgrade.
Why is it so hard to upgrade? Many reasons, let me give you just two:
1) Because maybe some businesses have their own solutions based on older versions. If you suddenly want them to jump to the latest (and modified version) it can be a problem and takes time. 
2) Many ppl care about their business first, only then, when everything is fine and they have plenty of time, they can take their time to study what the new acronym UASF means and then they can think about it. Every businessman knows that it can take months to find the time for it, if Bitcoin is not the very core of your business.

Exactly, BIP 148 itself is not good enough - one of the reasons for that is that it is rushed. From BIP 148:


@_date: 2017-04-30 15:28:50
Maybe I give you exact example from one country I used to live in. Say the income is 80,000, which is very good money in that country. The employer's cost to give that salary is 107,200 and the employee takes home 57,190.
This is income tax + insurance and it is 46.7 %, take home is 53.3 %. VAT is ~20 %, so from that 53.3 %, VAT makes 10.7 %. So the person now has only 42.6 %. This country does not have tax progression. There is a plan by current government to introduce the progression, so that the new take home would be 50,222. Many EU countries already has this progression, including my current country. With that progression, you would have 37.5 % after income taxes, insurance and VAT. So this is either 57.4 % taxation or 62.5 % if that new regulation passes.
So this is the base to which you apply other taxes. For example housing taxes, inheritance taxes, road taxes etc. So that's why I say the total taxation can be 80 % easily. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 13:24:27

To me, this situation seems like and colleagues find it hard (with their knowledge of the Asicboost case) to believe that it is just a "coincidence" that this Ext Block proposal was created. So maybe Joseph was not willingly working to support this, it is obvious conclusion and it is up to Joseph and other guys who proposed that to mitigate those concerns.
maybe you did not know about it, maybe it is really not connected, but don't be mad about ppl seeing the connection there. Just stay honest and fully disclose everything you know and you'll be fine.

Disclosure: I am new user of Uphold, very satisfied so far.
I have rewritten their numbers to a sheet and to be honest, I do not know what OP is talking about. 
If Voxel, whatever it is, is not counted, they are +$155k, which makes a good margin even if BTC went 2x up. They are -750 on BTC, which is currently cca -$300k. Unless BTC goes up more than 50 %, they are quite fine with their +$155k reserve. To get into troubles with this gap, the price would have to go up so quickly that they would not be able to react. I don't think this is a likely scenario.
If Voxel is counted, their reserve is as they say, more than +$1m. 
So, **what STRONG INDICATIONS are you talking about?**
@_date: 2016-02-14 16:34:46
I am too buying from them without problems. If you count the numbers yourself, they do not match what OP reported. A couple of hours ago, they were in +$155k with their reserve, not -$120k.

So forks are more likely. That is the first thing. The second thing is that if a group of miners with say 75 % want to push new setting, they will, because no one wants to be on the minor fork. So suddenly, this nicely working mechanism will stop working so nicely. Then the big miners will start to see they can get rid of some competitions to go crazy high in the parameters, so they will do it, then return back ... 
BTW - Your last sentence sounds like you have not read Bitcoin news during last months. Are you aware that miners actually block upgrades that the users want? Miners incentives seem currently to be to get as much money as fast as possible, not to really look for long term value. After all, it is old fact that if you rely on the price to go up, it is better to buy, not to mine.

If you have just couple of months for everyone to migrate, what is likely to happen is that 30-50 % of nodes will migrate, rest won't and the whole network will be greatly disrupted. This goes very much against your claim BIP 148 being the safest choice available. I very much disagree with that. There is nothing safe in this if this is being rushed as it is proposed.

I was mostly referring to 


This is where you made a mistake. It then sounds like members of core who have all the power to decide what will be released as Bitcoin Core signed HK agreement and therefore all other members are obliged to do something. This did not happen in the first place and even if it happened, ppl say that the other part of HK agreement was violated early after the agreement, therefore it would be questionable whether the agreement was binding then ... 
So just do not use "core" improperly because your claims are not valid then or are misleading. Also, you have probably misunderstood (if you are honest) the process of contribution to Bitcoin Core project.
Anyway, let's talk about this one


Could you see any difference between "2 MB non-wit data would be safe" vs. "releasing HF to 2 MB non-wit data would be safe"? If yes, I don't see how is your claim relevant then because. 
If no, then please consider that when ppl are talking about safety of blocksize increase, they are often talking about resource consumption risks (usually bandwidth) and things like block validation related problems (non-linear algorithm in validation might allow construction of disruptive malicious blocks). So even if the network nodes would be OK with 2 MB (resources&amp;validation-wise), it still does not mean the actual HF to it would be safe (incompatibility with non-upgraded nodes).

I live in EU country. I lived before in another EU country. I have info from other EU country, all seem to be +- same. 
So, let me start just by a two major taxes that are most recognized. One is income tax, and the other one is VAT. Income tax is different in every country, but for employees it can go as high as 50 % above certain level (maybe even more in some countries, I would not be surprised). The total income tax over the whole income can be 30-50 % depending on your earnings, if you are earning good money. VAT is roughly about 20 %, but e.g. Hungary has 27 %, Denmark 25 % (not sure if it is up to date, but never mind) and this is from what it remains in your pocket after income (and insurance) tax, so if your income and insurance together is 50-60 %, VAT is 20 % of 40-50 %, which is 8-10 %. So only income and VAT give you 38-60 %. 
And there are other taxes. In some countries they are called pension insurance and health insurance. Make no mistake, those are not voluntarily contributions or insurances, those are taxes. In other countries this is part of council tax. Anyway, this can go easily to 15 %. Now you are on 53-75 %. 
The rest is just more and more taxes, but there I can't be sure about other countries I have not lived in. Inheritance tax is very common. Extra fuel taxes are very common. Housing taxes are also very common. Etc. etc. etc. The total sum is usually over 80 %, I would not be surprised if even 85 or 90. Seriously.
Yes, if you are poor, don't own anything, your taxation is probably very very low on most of these countries. If you are active, high skilled and motivated worker, who contributes to the society instead of taking allowances, you are taxed to death. 
If you are skilled company with tons of lawyers and accountants, possibly you can make tricks here, tricks there, make offshore company etc. to lower your taxation to near zero. But I am rather speaking about individuals without these abilities.
EDIT: Fixed VAT and fixed income tax.

Do I understand it well that if you use SW in block, then if you make a change in the right side of MT, then this would change SW's 2nd MT data because that tree has to correspond to the primary MT and the same shuffle must be done in both trees, which means that a change in RHS of primary MT will cause that you need to rehash LHS of primary MT as well, thus you are losing the efficiency of the whole trick?

1. Decred is just a random altcoin that is highly unproven. Now why do you think this would work for Bitcoin? Decred says that big stakeholders have great power and can even punish miners. Great, but what about ~300k or how many coins has Roger Ver? Certainly Wu would also have some big amounts. So would something really change? These two have a lot of hash power and also lot of stake. Decred says that having a lot of stake means their intentions will be aligned with those of users, but we clearly see in case of Bitcoin that it is not the case for certain big stakeholders. Does not this invalidate your suggestion of using Decred?
2. Those are possibly nice visions, but those systems are in their infancy. They are not tested, not reliable. There is no dictatorship by Chinese mining cartel in Bitcoin (yet?). They only managed to (partially) block some improvements. Certainly they were not able to force new rules to the network. This is a big difference.

@_date: 2017-04-18 08:47:17
Two things - first, we all know these generic answers "change to something that ...", but is there such a thing that is good enough, tested, it is known how it behaves, etc. or is it just something non-existing at the moment that we have to invent first and it will take 5 years before it can really be deployed?
Second - is it not that such a nuclear option is roughly equivalent to just throw Bitcoin away and adapt an altcoin instead? If you answer no, what is the difference (other than that you will maintain the historic blockchain, so you still call it Bitcoin because it was called Bitcoin before)? Most of the time, I would say, it won't be Bitcoin anymore. Bitcoin is something hard to change and theoretically, if Wu only has 15 %, his chances of blocking SegWit (on Bitcoin, by its original activation model) are still very very good. So if we chance fundamentals just because of 15 % miner, is this Bitcoin? What if he has 10 %? 8? You get the point. This does not sound like a system that is hard to change.

How can a positive **reserve** be a bankrupcy? If I go to  I only see numbers related to their operating accounts in different currencies. There are no numbers on their debts and other assets, properties ... This page, if the numbers are to be trusted, just tells us that there is a healthy reserve. Nothing less, nothing more. If the reserve was not healthy, there could be implications, but as it is healthy, there can't be any implications about how the whole company is or is not healthy.
The whole transparency page they have is about "we are not running a fractional reserve model like others".

Bitcoin is always evolving. So far there has not been a period of time in which the Bitcoin would be conserved in its state and not evolving anymore. I'm OK with that.
Every one is replaceable. But if 50 (even if just 20) of them leave instantly, it can take years to find someone to be as good. But that is not even a point. The point is that one of the principal values of the project would die. Not many those that could replace them would jump on board because of that. It will stop be interesting.

I don't actually criticize the connection between OB1 and DCG. It is OB1 themselves who signed NYA. Did Blockstream sign NYA? Nope. 
The connection with DCG is just speculative reason why OB1 signed that. You said that this speculation is not true and I can even believe you, I don't care. At the end it does not matter, the thing is that OB1 has its name on NYA, that's all we need to know.

You can hardly see a 2 MB block if there are only 200-500 kb of transactions in the mempool ... check 
Jokes aside. When there are enough transactions, we can start seeing 1.2 MB blocks now, 1.1 MB is more often now. That's not a bad adoption speed if you ask me. 2 MB will come, but not with the low number of transactions we can see in these days.
@_date: 2017-10-08 08:20:22
OK, so back to technical discussion. If you are rich, you can always make enough transactions to flood Bitcoin. There is no real difference between 4 MB weight or 8 MB weight cap. 2x solves nothing, and it is rushed, and so the problems with HF in such a short time frame are not justified. There is simply no benefit in doing that. At the times, BU was the other side, so if the cap was doubled, another argument would come that we need to triple it, or more. This was just for the sake of saying that BU is better, because it is "unlimited". 
And you could go on and on, if we triple, they would say we need to go 4x, ... But no fixed multiplier would actually solve scalability of Bitcoin. Scalability in IT is never solved by creating solutions that grow linearly. You need something better. Things like aggregated signatures won't solve it, but will help make it more efficient. The big thing here is LN for example. That is one of the major techs to change it big time. 
So, what I'm saying is that arbitrary fixed number won't solve anything. It could help very short time. But there is currently no need. The artificial need can always be produced by rich people, but it can hardly be accepted as an argument. It is like keeping your garbage in your garage and then dump it at once and say that you need bigger garbage can. Yes, at that moment, your artificial demand was greater than available supply, but it was the malicious action that messed it up, not a general property of the system. We can see the system working normally now, there is no great backlog of transactions. And at time there is such a backlog, you can see that blocks are not being used well (most transactions are still nonSW). 
You are right that no one can tell what legitimate transactions are. And the beauty of the fees is that they will solve the problem sooner or later. Yes, at the times, it is more expensive to transact because someone had to prove his point that he is rich and can pay more than you. This can't be easily avoided and no, 2x, 4x, 10x makes no difference against such behavior.

Nice story, but dude, that PIN 45455544 is the second worst pin you could ever selected from security point of view. It's security against a malware on your computer is no better than PIN "12". A malware that is able to watch your clicks would see that your PIN consists of just 2 different digits. All that would be needed is just try all combinations in form of xyxyyyxx for different x and y. 
So, from security point of view, you could have chosen your PIN to be "45" and it would be almost just as good, except that you would not have hard time to recover it :-)

Some hardforks are dangerous, some less, some not at all. Hardforks that come without reply protection, uses same protocol, simulate their user agents on the network so they can't be distinguished, etc. are dangerous. How? How about a wallet that is not fully validating. How is such a wallet supposed to recognize which node is which. In such a hardfork, for many users, it is easy to lose money.
Many is for users as well as developers. I can recommend reading articles from Eric:

OK, so, if 5 % investment is trivial, why did you take it and jump in bed with them? If that was trivial, you did not need the money, did you? So maybe it was trivial, you did not need the money, you just accepted it anyway because you already had the same opinions. It does not really matter if those opinions were injected to you or you had them already, result is the same.
No, there was no gridlock. BIP 141 had its activation process set for 1 year. However, if after 1 year it would not activate, there would be absolutely no problem to try to activate it again with different mechanism. So no, no gridlock. Don't spread misinformation.
And feel free to call it dumb that I won't support your project by using it. Every project and every website gains value if it can demonstrate that it serve more users. So obviously, your company would benefit from the project having more users. I refuse to do that for you because you demonstrate again and again that you don't deserve it. 
It is like having a mobile network operator with wonderful network and coverage. Still, if the guys are dicks with terrible customer service and support, it is not dumb to go for something else. Same if some shoe company has great shoes but the way of producing them sucks in a way you don't agree with it, it is not dumb not to buy from them. That is how users vote. With their wallet, with what they install and use or not.
So yeah, you can either call me dumb or do something about it that I want to use your product again. And we know what have you chosen, right?

Do you say that there is no problem with having to replace all software in a decentralized ecosystem? Monero and Ethereum are not Bitcoin, we are talking about quite centralized projects vs a very decentralized system. 
Of course, if I am a vendor of instant messaging system and I change the protocol to be incompatible with earlier clients, it is not a big deal. I can force my users to start using the new version of the client. And since I update my servers that everyone relies on, I can do that. Everyone will either upgrade or go away. This is fundamentally different environment to Bitcoin.
One of the primary values in Bitcoin is its resistance to incompatible updates and another is the decetralization factor. If you compare to projects with value coming from different properties, Bitcoin will look silly. Compare efficiency of Bitcoin blockchain database to Oracle or MSSQL server. Bitcoin looks really stupid in such a comparison. But that is only because such a comparison does not make sense.
But even if we do compare them. Then hardforks in Bitcoin are very different to e.g. Monero. Hardforks in Monero are not controversial. Non-controversial HF are very much OK, but they are still very difficult in decentralized system. If they are not difficult in Monero, it means it is not as much decentralized.
As for the article you linked - Vitalik is wrong in the second section of this article. He writes




For some reason, he is not mentioning that with softfork, the user who does not upgrade DOES NOT use the new rules. No one is forced to new rules. Say there is a new address format. With SF, the user is allowed to use the old format. Vitalik completely misses this, which makes his words wrong here. He calls SFs as coercive (and so do you) and at the same time he forgets about this very important property that you are not forced to anything, you can still use the old rules if you want. You don't like SegWit? Fine, don't use it. Use a wallet that does not implement it. It will still work.

There are many dangers in 2x approach. Let me focus on one single thing, so we are focused in our debate. That point is what many understand as on of the Bitcoin's greatest source of value - Bitcoin is not controlled by any corporation or state entity. You change this property, and suddenly it becomes uninteresting for many. 
So what 2x means is that couple of guys can enforce with their shitloads of money a control of Bitcoin rules. This immediately leads to losing the interest of bright minds working on Bitcoin Core project. So the risk of removing that property also means the risk of losing tens of those top level programmers that you can hardly find a coupe in other projects. 
Therefore, 2x means you will replace the top level programmers with medium level programmers. This is likely to lead to bugs (see BU just for the sake of example). Very serious bugs are going to be introduced and they will be exploited. This is 2x. If you are fine with this then there are many other arguments against 2x, but it is probably pointless to discuss them because you are looking for completely different system than many here, which is fine, but it is very much pointless to try to cooperate because the goals differs much.
@_date: 2017-10-07 09:54:51
Nope, there is no hole in the argument of decentralization. An open project that anyone can contribute and has over 100 of active contributors, some of them at the absolute edge of the current scientific knowledge, is one of the most decentralized development that we currently know.
This is not about religion of some holy coders. No, it is just respect coming from the knowledge that they are very smart and knowledgeable people. There is nothing magic about them, there is nothing holy about them. It is just respect from one programmer to another, as if you were a surgeon and had a respect to another surgeon because you could see that his work is extraordinary. 
The fact that you consider a compromise in science to be a good thing means that you don't understand science. Compromise in science means that instead of facts and research, you prefer politics. That is not a scientific approach. Let me give you an example. You might own a car, let's say it is a petrol car. Now let me tell you that your car would be better if you use water instead of petrol to run it. You don't agree. So, how about we make a compromise and use 50 % water and 50 % petrol. According to your approach, you should not care about this being complete non-sense, not backed up by any science, but just for the sake of compromise it is a good thing as you would please me. This is your compromise in science. This is not how this works.
If you want to discuss further, please get rid of belief systems and compromises in science. Give me the facts why something like 2x makes sense. So far, I've heard no such arguments, just politics, hate against "core". But are there any actual facts and scientific reasons?

I don't know what is your job, but if you are good at it, you may be able to recognize that others are also good at it and you respect them for that. I do actually spend at least 10 hours a week studying Bitcoin and related technology, reading whitepapers, mailing lists, etc. And I do that for last 2 years. I've been in Bitcoin even before that, but last 2 years are very intensive for me, spending shitloads of time on learning and reading just about everything I can. So, I consider my knowledge about Bitcoin to be quite good. So please, leave your shaming comments about someone blindly doing something to someone else. Or prove my knowledge wrong, if you could. Otherwise you may look like an idiot, alright? Passionately yes, blindly no.
2) The answer would be "fighting ignorance", that is what drives me.
3) Reading your comment again. Your argument 


is completely terrible. If I make a claim or an argument and you say that just because someone else believes in something (or says something) my argument is invalid, that is very poor logic. You might try to work on that next time. Learn logic first please before trying to reply.

There are other options, but HF takes a long time to deploy safely and if we want to speed things up, SW is the way to go. 
And in current situation where SW is enabled, not using it is less efficient in terms of how much you can put into a block.

What are you talking about!? This is such a misleading title and shitty tweet. WTF dude? Seriously.
1) There are people actually talking about Fast MTs on mailing list due to possible improvements/attack vector redemption. It is just in another thread of mailing list.
2) Probably many people added this to their TODO list which is rather long and will respond in couple weeks time.
3) WTF is that with "Big Name". No one is required to spend any minute on whatever proposal. People that are interested in subject will pay attention to it. People that are focused on something else will possibly not pay attention to it, or will pay attention to it once the proposal is finalized by people who are very interested in that. 
4) And who are you to judge who is or is not a "big name" - btw. Russell O'Connor and Peter Todd replied to that FMT thread. 
Yet you trivialize it by reference to "price talk" or "debate side". Seriously disappointing by this post.

Absolutely, me too. But currently it is quite impossible, without artificial influence, to get 2 MB block. And it is not because SW would not work, there are just not enough transactions. 
What is probably going to happen is that some big players (exchanges) implement SW for their own good, which will cause the blocks to go up in size at times there are enough transactions. I thing very soon we can see 1.5 MB blocks like that. 
So to summarize, I don't think there were any outrageous claims about SW being 2 MB blocks. The circumstances just don't provide that opportunity at the moment. But should they be needed, they will appear.

It is not a lie. First, people contribute not only by code, but also by research. For example, GMax has "only" 158 commits, but we know he does a lot of research too. Second, take list of contributors from here  and merge it with the list here  and you get 164. 97 of which contributed specifically to 0.15.0. 
So don't bullshit people telling that something is lie if you don't know what you are talking about.

NYA software is not 2 years old, it is still under development, doing quite serious changes in last couple of weeks. For HF, you need to have a produce released and not touch it and just test it for months and then wait with deployment many many more months. People assume 12-18 months to be safe. So no, I'm not kidding, it is rushed ad absurdum.

Second, you are the one making big bold claims. If you read my response, in no way I said anything about your knowledge. Could be great, could be shit. I don't know. I was talking about my knowledge that you tried to laugh at. And you just picked the wrong guy for that. And no, your dog is not a developer. 
This sub is still very fun place to talk about things if you are not a dick. You are presenting yourself as a dick, so don't be amazed people see you as such. You arguments are weak, you attack people without knowing them, your dog is a developer. That is not how a quality discussion is made.
Core developers deserve their respect. Unlike competitive movements, they don't talk shit, they develop and deliver. Learn the difference.
And lastly, again you are using wrong argumentation aka fouling. No one ever said segwit was the only option. Yet you are using it as if that was true. So again, you are trying to manipulate discussion with untrue statements. So unless you learn how to discuss properly, feel free to read Eric's blog to educate yourself, but no longer I'm happy to discuss this with you. You are not interested in knowing, just shitting on things. But I leave with one hint. The blocksize is just a random reason that was picked to have something against Core developers. Blocksize itself is not important here.

There are many dangers in 2x approach. Let me focus on one single thing, so we are focused in our debate. That point is what many understand as on of the Bitcoin's greatest source of value - Bitcoin is not controlled by any corporation or state entity. You change this property, and suddenly it becomes uninteresting for many.
So what 2x means is that couple of guys can enforce with their shitloads of money a control of Bitcoin rules. This immediately leads to losing the interest of bright minds working on Bitcoin Core project. So the risk of removing that property also means the risk of losing tens of those top level programmers that you can hardly find a coupe in other projects.
Therefore, 2x means you will replace the top level programmers with medium level programmers. This is likely to lead to bugs (see BU just for the sake of example). Very serious bugs are going to be introduced and they will be exploited. This is 2x. If you are fine with this then there are many other arguments against 2x, but it is probably pointless to discuss them because you are looking for completely different system than many here, which is fine, but it is very much pointless to try to cooperate because the goals differs much.

Good analogy would be to say that the Earth is flat because some rich dudes came to that consensus. We do have some scientists that say that Earth is not flat, but let's just not listen to those because we can agree with our business partners that the Earth is flat.
I believe for some people it is not much about community, it is about science. For some other people it can be that the agreement is only among some businessmen and does not include users and tech leaders. So partially yes to your question, but not 100%. For example, myself, I'm more about the scientific argument than the community. Even if the agreement is made with much wider audience, it still can be bad decision that goes against science. In that case I would still oppose that.

Not at all. It is perfectly fine to have a block validation time longer than 4 seconds. And it is perfectly fine if someone due to this mines an empty block. Empty block does add security to the transactions mined earlier. But that does not imply anything that much about blocksize. If you have 5-10 seconds on validation that is just fine from blocksize point of view.

It is not the same. Pay to surf means that a visitor is paid for the action to visit third party website. The visitor in this case is not interested in the target website content.
In case of a faucet, however, the website owner provides something that a visitor wants and it is a same concept as if you put a funny video there or a game - that kind of thing is OK as it is not incentivized traffic **source**.
If you think about it - why Google does not want paid to surf program visitors. It is simply because that such visitors behaves differently to those users that come naturally to the web page and are interested in the content. So, for example, if we have a bitcoin faucet website, its content is about bitcoin and Google can put there bitcoin related ads. Visitors that are interested in getting free bitcoin are more likely to be interested in bitcoin ads and this is what Google wants. Those are legitimate and good visitors for Google, unlike those coming from paid to surf programs.

So what you basically say that by some magic your state only gets X in taxes, but is able to produce value orders of magnitude greater than X. And you still think your math works?
In fact, someone built that road using some money and people are using it ever since. All those money were collected from taxes. It can't be that the road cost more than the state gained from taxes (except for state debt of course). 
Similarly, you can have a private entity building a road and charging people for using it. At the end the cost of the road would be actually smaller than in case of state tax.

Because they are used to a life style in which someone (state) will take care of them. This is a mental block and a generation problem. If you raise new generation in different conditions without socialistic habbits, you get different result.
Also in your specific case, the private road is wrongly established. You never want to own something together with other people if the other people are idiots. This will always end bad for you. If your conjoint ownership is not backed by a contract that would assure you a reasonable use of the road, your initial conditions are fucked up already. This is not a fault of or in the libertarianism, however.

Very good question and applies to Trezor as well. Thing is your control of private keys with HW wallets is little different (worse?) because HW wallets usually do not allow you to get private keys out of them.

My personal opinion here is very much like what Greg expressed on bitcoin-dev mailing list. That 51% is quite a big condition and a game changer. If you'd have 51 and a good luck or a lot more than 51, then many of the risks are going away. But who can say they have 51 for this? We will see in upcoming days and weeks if someone has it. So, to assume 51+ is a big one, but even then, if it is not much more than 51, the risk of bad luck is very high. Actually if you'd have exactly 51, it could be a big mess for a very long time. 
For me, the much more worrying part is the scenario when this does not have 51, but say 10, 20, 30. Then it really sucks.

It is because if you need to send fast transaction, you should calculate correct fee. There are thousands and thousands of transactions coming from use cases that do not need to be confirmed quickly. It is absolutely ok for them to use low fee and wait 1 or 2 days. But if someone sends a low fee and then complains, that's just his mistake (or his wallet/provider).

If you don't like BIP 149, you can suggest a new BIP that would combine 148 with 149 - i.e. add decisiveness. In that I agree 148 is better, but 148 is also worse because of too small time frame. So possibly a combination of these two, taking the best of them might be the key. What do you think?
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:33:57
Could you explain your math there? You government is getting X money from taxes. Each government has its expenses that are related just to the government itself - that's Y. If there is no corruption whatsoever, at most X-Y is left to give you back. 
But you just claimed that you get back far more than you put there. Obviously you are somehow special, because it can't be that for everyone in your country (that -Y is just lost on administrative). 
So that means that either you are getting some extra money (like social contributions) from your government. OK, for you it works, socialism is great for you, you do not contribute that much, you are poor and your taxes are very low. Other people in your country are being robbed so that you can get your payments from the social system. Well done you :/
Alternatively, you math is wrong and you do not get back that much, you just think it is that much.

I don't really have any tutorials for that, but try to create a new post here.
However, please note that there is a big difference between running a full node that signals for BIP148 via uacomment and running a full node that actually implements BIP148.
The signalling one is nice, but adds nothing unless you upgrade at the end to the one that actually implements it. This is one of the risks of BIP148 - people will run nodes that only signal, thus making it look like it has somehow big support. Then they won't upgrade and the reality will be completely different.

This really depends on the wallet software and marketing of node owners. If the wallet software used by wast majority of end users joins randomly + some minor prefiltering, you are not going to end with such an uneven distribution. On the other hand, if there is a strong centralized player that wants more users and creates its own wallet, then you might end with such distribution. However, in my model, what are the incentives for having more users on your node? You have some operation cost for the node and you have some profit from fees. But the profit from fees is +- fixed % of what you lock. So you have an investment opportunity here and you can get 0.5 % of your locked BTC minus your server cost. But if you want more users, you need to lock more BTC and your income is still no more than 0.5 % in my model. What you can do is to increase this fee to 5 %. But why would users go with you then? You would need marketing for that to sell them 5 % fee service over competition of 0.5 %. But then your expense increase. 
So, not saying it is impossible to achieve such uneven distribution, but not sure if it is more realistic.
@_date: 2017-07-07 08:48:31
Thanks for asking. I am big SW and LN fan, but BIP 148? Not so much. Recently this NYA thing was proposed. If I was about to choose either NYA or 148, I go with 148, no regrets. But is that the case? I am actually not sure whether these are the only two options we have. 
If you could convince me that there are no other options, then you get me for 148. 
What is the situation then? We've got 80+ % for NYA, so it seems that this one is going to happen very very likely. It also seems (not sure I've got latest news though) like NYA implementation is going to activate SW before 148 starts, so 148 will be void. So we have SW by NYA, but then what? After 3 months (?) those implementing NYA (or maybe just some of them) fork off with "2x" part of it. 
So, to me it looks like we are getting NYA rather than 148 even if we wanted 148. 148 will just be void because SW will be there and that's it. Or not?
The real question is then, how things will evolve with "2x" part. Will majority of signers of NYA revert back from it? That would be great. It would not only prevented this political "2x" part that has little support in tech. community, but it would also proven these "agreements of few" as being unreliable and thus possibly prevent further such deals in the future.

You say it won't work, but so far anything with less or zero state intervention works better almost everywhere. Sure, at the end it is all about people, but the state is not the solution. You won't have utopian paradise with all people behaving in any form of society, but that does not mean there are no better models. 
Most of what you criticize is not what you'd call a free market. Those problems are there exactly because there is no free market. Because people rely on the state to take care of those issues and the state does not. Therefore you have those problems you mention. If there was no state and people knew they are on their own, you would get different results.

@_date: 2017-07-11 07:20:01
Thanks for questions. Forgive me not to answer them all - I'd be more than happy for other people to make those calculations. 
I am still not convinced about the power law distribution - see my comment to comment.
How many tx on-chain? - I made no assumption about how long are we going to maintain a single channel, even on avg. Surely it depends on how quickly people spend their money. I have no knowledge in this area, so everything I give you here would be another wild guess that will later be proven wrong. We can say 1 year and then calculate what does it mean for 30m user channels (and just by quickly looking at it, 160k on chain daily transactions pops up to me). 
What is the blocksize? - Super duper wild guess - I lock 400k BTC, which is ~2.3 % of all available BTC in near future. So why not to use 2.3 % of blockchain space on our on-chain channel transactions? If 160k txs daily is the right number (and I don't say it is), it would mean, we want to achieve about 7m tx daily on chain. That certainly means bigger block size - but again, we don't know the time frame for achieving 10m users on LN. If we were happy about LN consuming more than 2.3 % of blockchain space, e.g. 23 %, then we would just need 700k tx daily on chain. That is something that might be possible with SW + Schnorr without even "2x of NYA". So depends ... it seems like without any problems and any blocksize increase beyond just pure 4MB of block weight (pure SW without 2x) would be well enough to serve 1m users on LN consuming just 2.3 % of blockchain space. This is all +- 50 % error :-) 
Mining fee - again, no idea. Let's see how SW affects the fees. Say we only have pure SW and the total number of fees per block is preserved. Thus the per-transaction fee could be lowered by the factor of "something around 2". But then - what is the tx fee now? Is it 400 sat/B as we saw in previous months? Or is it 20 sat/B as we are seeing in these days?
Profit for node? - I've designed it to be 0.5 % of the locked BTCs in user's channels, so like 0.25 % of the total locked investment. It might sound small %, but you don't really need to fight inflation on BTC investment ... so maybe it is good enough to pay for the server cost? Maybe your primary profit from having this kind of node is the increase in Bitcoin network value as a whole? Don't know, market will say.
As a user motivated... - it won't cost you less, that's the point. The node-to-node fees are designed to be so low, that it does not matter if you have 2 hops or 10 hops in my network. Your cost is determined by the node-to-user fee, which is set to 0.5 %. Or do you really care if you pay 0.51 % or 0.52 % for your $3 purchase? We are talking about 5 cents difference on your whole $350 budget.

I understand locking your BTC as an investment. If you offer 0.5 % (per year?) on that, it could be a good investment for many. If you offer 0.005 % maybe the incentive would be too small.
From user's perspective, try to look at it as if the merchant could offer you 5 % discount if you pay with BTC. This is not unrealistic because using BTC you will save them 2-5 % transaction fee using other systems like cards / PayPal, and you also protect them against chargebacks. So you can get 5 % or maybe even more discount by using BTC. Suddenly that 0.5 % fee for end user does not look that bad and in total (considering the discount) you might reach zero fee.

redditseur's answer is right - if you are unsure, just don't move the coins (if you have them home - i.e. you own the private keys with you) - this is short answer and applies in almost all cases (because Bitcoin Core developers always attempt this option to be safe)
you can be sure that if something becomes a standard, Bitcoin Core software will implement it. what it currently looks like is that 3 months after SW activates, a certain (and possibly quite big) part of miners will hardfork (HF) to even bigger blocks. if this happens, there will be 2 chains and you will own coins on both of them. if you stick with your Bitcoin Core software, you will be able to control your coins on the original chain and you will need another software if you would like to work with your coins on the other chain as well (which then will most likely be unable to work with the coins on the original chain, so you really will need 2 different wallets to operate both kinds of coins - it might happen that someone will create a single wallet software that will be able to work with both of them, but it is unlikely to be Bitcoin Core)
when this HF happens, it could be dangerous to keep your coins on an exchange as you don't know which chain will it support. some exchanges may go with one chain, some with the other, and some will support both - but as always, the safest option is to own the private keys yourself and have you control your coins

Hence PayPal 2.0 ... little better than PayPal 1.0, but still pretty shitty compared to what Bitcoin has to offer for many.
Holding your private keys is a nice thing, but by itself it is worth very little. If there is central/gov authority that can go and erase your coins, change supply, censor your transactions, then your keys are not very useful. For me, it is chargebacks, PayPal 2.0 might have them because govs will require them. For me, chargebacks are deal breaker.

That is actually the right thing to do, You should not look at who is proposing the idea, you should evaluate the idea itself. If the idea is brilliant it really does not matter if the person comes with it has bad history or not. 
In this case, the idea is a terribly centralized altcoin run by banks in big data centers on expensive machines. For me, it is "no, thank you". And I don't really care who came with that idea. Even if it came from guys I like, it still would be "no, thank you".
So, I think, you should not criticise Ver for not caring about "Satoshi or not", you should criticse Ver for supporting such a shitty idea.

One example is private insurance. The company calculates your risk and ask you to pay each month X money. In an unlikely event that very bad thing happens to you, the company will give you Y &gt; sum(Xi) to cover your problems. However, the company won't be in loss because in sum from all its customers it gets more money than it pays.
You see? No state necessary there. Everything else is alike. So you have healthcare covered by this. What else? Roads? How about paying for using the road? Private owner builds the road and expects ROI in 30 years. Road users have to pay one-time or monthly to use the road. You are able to use thousands of miles of roads, you only pay small amount of money for what you use. In total, however, all users will make profit to the owner for their investment.
It is not that hard to understand this. There is no state necessary. For anything.

Simple - how many BIP 91 nodes are there (answer is not many, but it is hard to say because they don't even announce that in their subversion description, but let's guess less than 50 or less than 100)? What is the chance of those nodes to be connected to each other unless the connection is setup manually (answer is small)? 
There are likely over 500 UASF nodes (let's assume half of all UASF nodes are fake). So the chance is much better than in case of BIP 91 nodes.

Thanks for comments! Honestly, I just wanted a quick write up of the basic idea (and possibly let other evolve on that if it is somewhat viable) and that 8 hop wild guess could be off. If I was about to have a better guess, I would make a simulation and just tried to randomly select node's peers with the rule that prevents connecting to direct neighbors of one's neighbors. You might be right that it will lead to bad worse case, I simply did not check.
And yes, I made a mistake with the total channel count. Thanks for finding that for me. Will fix that. I'm just not sure if I'd rather have 300k nodes or 300 channels per node for users. Chmm... Will probably go with 300 channels.
@_date: 2017-07-04 11:26:49
But why bother in such a scenario? Why don't we just use existing databases that run much more efficiently and don't need $20k machines, just $2k or even $200. Those database machines have lower cost and thus can be distributed among more parties than these $20k machines. 
So what is the point? Why don't we use cheaper and better technology, if we are OK to trust those companies to run them honestly?
And the answer it that suddenly, when you do this, it is no longer interesting. It is not Bitcoin anymore. It is not trustless and permissionless system. It is just PayPal 2.0 - i.e. PayPal run by X companies instead of one. 
I can tell you that most of the people here are not interested in PayPal 2.0. No matter how "practical" it is.

Opening channels cost depends on the network fees. That's something that is hard to predict and it would also need us to specify, how long the registration to your first, second and third node is OK to take. Of course, this can only work if an on-chain transaction is priced reasonably. With time, there will be more tricks to make it cheaper.
Ending with 100 nodes with 100k users instead of vice versa - there are several factors and risks. For example, there is a risk of having too many coins on a single machine that can be hacked. But the most important thing is that should the model provide an incentive to run a node, it is likely that many people will try to run the node and you can't do much about it (except for trying to DDoS them etc.) So OK, you have your 100 super big nodes and then you have 1000 nodes of normal people. The important thing here is how the most popular end user wallet is behaving - if it really just connects to random 3, then your 100 super big nodes are unlikely to get many more users than anyone else (until there is a saturation - i.e. other nodes refuse to take more, but why it would be likely to happen compared to just more nodes being spawned). If it makes sense for you to create a super big node, it will make sense to other people to create a smaller node. You won't get much advantage and your risk is high. End user wallet should not prefer any particular node because that is dangerous (if the node has too many users, like 100k, if it dies, suddenly all its clients will have a deadline to close their channels and the blockchain might not be able to serve them on time). So for end users the incentive is to go randomly or otherwise not going to go where too many users are already.

Up until recently, there was a great amount of uncertainty if you wanted to start a new project/business for LN. You could not know when and if it will be a thing due to SegWit blockade. This problem seems to be resolved, or at least the risk is much lower now, so you can expect more devs and entrepreneurs jumping on that train. This will result in new solutions being created for end users presumably within 6-12 months. Fingers crossed, the future is bright.

Exactly, 2016 blocks is normally 2 weeks, but say you have only 25 % "normal" hashrate, then it is not 1 block every 10 mins on avg, but rather 1 block every 40 minutes and diff. retarget after 8 weeks. 
Of course that also means a potentially huge backlog of unconfirmed transaction, but that is probably not the biggest problem.
The question about who is going to leave is subjective. Some people would rather ask who is going jump in. I don't have latest numbers, but IIRC BitFury is happy to do 148 and part of Slush, couple of small ones maybe. So that's what? 12 % at best?

Example of how price moves up on a specific exchange: 
There is a list of sell orders made by people who want to sell. Each such order is for some specific amount at a specific price, so let's say the current price is 100 USD (this means last trade made on that exchange was at this price) per BTC and the lowest selling orders are:
* 1) 1 BTC for 100.50 USD
* 2) 0.1 BTC for 100.60 USD
* 3) 5 BTC for 101.20 USD
If someone wants to buy 2 BTC, the following happens:
* a) The first order 1) will be satisfied fully, the buyer will get 1 BTC and will pay $100.50 for it. 
* b) The order 2) will also be fully satisfied, the buyer will get 0.1 BTC and will pay $10.06 for it. 
* c) The order 3) will be satisfied only partially as only 0.9 BTC will be purchased by the buyer and she will pay $91.08 for it.
In total, the purchase of 2 BTC cost the buyer $201.64 and the price on this exchange just moved from 100 USD to 101.20 USD per BTC.

No, at no point you deposit coins to hub's (or what I call gateway) own address. If that was the case, you would be right that you would need to trust the other party to behave and that is something that would ruin the whole concept.
What actually happens in LN is that two parties (say you, Alice, and one of your gateways that you chose, Bob) create a payment channel. That channel has certain capacity and initial distribution. 
So Alice and Bob create channel and Alice contributes 2 BTC, while Bob contributes 0.5 BTC. The whole channel capacity is thus 2.5 BTC. What is important is that both Alice and Bob know which part of the channel funds belong to each other. So Alice knows that she has 2 BTC there. Bob knows that as well. If they want to close the channel, they get only what is theirs, they can not steal coins from the other party.
Now a basic operation of the channel is changing the balance. So if Alice wants to pay 0.1 BTC to Bob or someone via Bob, she says "I want to do this and the new channel balance will be 1.9 BTC for me and 0.6 BTC for you." As they both agree on this state, this becomes a new state and all previous states are no longer acceptable. Now if they close the channel, Alice gets 1.9 BTC and Bob 0.6 BTC. 
There are several problems with this that LN does solve:
 * What if Bob's node goes offline and Bob is no longer reachable? LN does allow channel closing by a single party. It is not as nice as if they both agree, but still, you will not lose your coins.
 * There is a technical issue with that any party can actually try to close the channel by themselves using OLD balance (so after Alice paid 0.1, the balance changed to 1.9 vs 0.6, but Alice wants to cheat and tries to close the channel with old balance 2 vs 0.5). And here is where Bob has to be monitoring the blockchain for such fraudulent attempt of Alice and LN gives Bob a way to actually stop the attack. There is limited for Bob to do so, however. This is where a nice concept of delegating the monitoring of these attacks has been invented. It is possible that you ask some other party to monitor the chain for you so that you don't need to be online when the other party attempts to attack you. 
In LN you don't need to trust your channel partner. Your risks are:
 * If you only use one gateway and it goes offline, you can't pay via LN until it is online.
 * Your funds are locked until the channel is closed, which sometimes (e.g. when the other party is unavailable) can take some time. So it is possible that you might need some funds and you won't be able to get them back from the channel as quickly as you need.
 * You need to monitor the chain for attacks from the other party, or have it monitored for you. This is required, otherwise the other party could close the channel with one of the old channel balances.
 * There is very special risk in that part where you want to stop the mentioned attack of your partner. In order to stop the attack, you need to put a transaction on the blockchain that will give funds to you (thus stopping the attack). The problem is that if your partner is a BIG BIG hub, with many thousands of clients using it, and the blockchain is congested with many many transactions, it might happen that your transaction won't be mined on time and the attack won't be stopped. Obviously, this depends on many factors and you can do something about one of those factors - the mining fee. So if you are having a significant money in the channel and you see the attack, you can set a fee high enough to almost guarantee that it will be mined on time (you can't actually guarantee it because miners can be bribed not to include your transaction and stuff like this). So this sounds really really bad, right? It is not that bad. It is not for three reasons - 1) in LN, you are not expected to have channels with great capacities. So losing 1 or 10 BTC by this attack is unreal. You are likely to use LN for very large number of very small payments, so you might have 3 channels in total with 3 different gateways and each will be something like 500-1000 USD. 2) More importantly, if you use it as a I described - i.e. you are an end user and you use a gateway then most likely the channel balance will start with something like 0.5 BTC for you and 0 for your partner and will only go one way - your part will go down and your partner's part will go up. This means that any OLD balance is actually better for you, so it makes no sense for your partner to even try this attack. 3) Finally, there is super cool thing that if your channel partner attempts the attack and you actually succeeds in stopping it (which is very likely). You will get not only what belongs to you according to the latest correct balance, but you get everything - i.e. the attacker is punished by losing everything. So it is somewhat unlikely that someone would even attempt to make this attack.
Note that I really tried to avoid technicalities here. If you are interested in them, I recommend a series of articles [Understanding the Lightning Network]( They go into very technical details there which are indeed interesting!

vary -&gt; yes
fixed or % -&gt; not counted from the amount being sent, but size of the transaction (technical thing), i.e. much more fixed than %
cheapest -&gt; to get cheapest fees does not mean the best; but in general, you get cheapest and usable fees by understanding how it works and using a wallet that allows you to manually specify the fee; however, this is very advanced and hardly recommended for you as you are asking these questions - so in practice, for you, use a wallet that has a dynamically calculated fees and you will likely end with paying more than necessary, but not crazy too much;
if you really wanted lowest fees, you can go to   and  and look at that data and determine your fee - currently i would go for 140 sat/B to get fastest (or close to) transaction without paying too much; if you like to gamble, you could even go for 100 sat/B and quite likely, it would be fine

Author is completely missing the point and produced an article full of errors. Let's just focus on the point that he missed. 
Today, we have Bitcoin network that is the most decentralized practical system every built. What are we aiming for with LN? Is it enough to achieve a similar level (asymptotically) with LN? I would say yes. The author says NO.
Today, you've got most of the Bitcoin users, who have their own wallets (i.e. actually own their private keys and coins), using some kinds of SPV wallets. It is quite rare for a common user (not business user) to run a full node. What does this mean? This means that there is a full node that this wallet connects to and provide services to it. Sounds like the evil centralized bank hub from this article, doesn't it? It is exactly that - one server serving a large number of individuals who do not run their own full node. What is LN analogy? It is a LN gateway hub that serves a number of individuals and is itself well connected to the LN. This obviously means that end users are not expected to have these always online machines with 10, 20, 40 open channels to form the network. That is not going to happen for obvious reasons. You will have the gateway and a "light wallet" for end user. The end user will have 2-5 open channels with such gateways to protect himself from being unable to use LN when his gateway is offline for whatever reason.
The user will NOT need to online all the time. A transaction monitoring service (most likely offered by these gateways as well) will monitor his channels with other gateways.
Does this model require any additional trust? Not at all. Your coins are still yours, no one can steal from you, you can only suffer from time-locks when something goes wrong, but most of the time it will just work.
This model is very similar to how Bitcoin works today. Just as we have cca 6k nodes that are open to everyone, we will have a similar number of LN gateways serving end users. And they will be rewarded for that, which will make an incentive to actually run full node. So, not only LN will not be any much centralized than today's network, it will provide an incentive for increase in the number of nodes, which will improve the decentralization for both layer 1 and 2 of Bitcoin.
