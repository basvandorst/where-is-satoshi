However, I didn't find the most important information in the article - *how much was 1 bitcoin worth* in such an official auction, performed in in public, but independent from the usual exchanges?

According to the famous time traveler, it *must* be 16k. How could a time traveler from the future ever be wrong?

Archeology could find cultic items whose oldest examples are of that age. Since gold doesn't decay they can still find the figures and chalices, and they also find coins - but they are much younger, the oldest gold coin from King Croesus is dated from 2,600 years ago.

There were good old times when a bank would pay 3 percent interest on savings, but would lend out money for 8 percent. The situation was much more normal than today looking at basic economics, because
a) saving money means you abstain from consumption, which must be rewarded to make sense economically
b) getting a credit means you would have to pay back more, because "money today" has more economic value than "money tomorrow".
We are living in crazy times. With the economic equations being turned upside down, nothing in the financial world is following a stable logic now. It won't work like this long-term, I fear.

Nothing wrong because you say it's a prediction - so you know already that it can turn out completely different.

Is this how the long-term hodlers are going to look like in 10 years?

Since months people are explaining to others here and elsewhere that bitcoin prices would *surely* soar upon the halving. It's rather obvious that this time, the majority of the community is fully aware, which means there's a big risk of disappointment, if lots of people expect the price to spike but it doesn't - exactly because everybody has anticipated it already.

The concept of intrinsic value is misunderstood very often, and the author of the article didn't get it as well. Intrinsic value means, that something is needed *outside* the financial world, which creates a constant demand for it which is *independent* from a monetary usage, which may or may not exist in parallel. 
Since 3,500 years, gold was mainly used to manufacture cultic items and jewelry. Sources say that 80 percent of all gold are used to manufacture jewelry. The author describes the physical features of gold correctly, especially ancient men must have been stunned by the heavy weight and the outstanding shimmering yellow color, which is unique in nature. Its durability and malleability makes it the ideal raw material for chalices, cups, crowns, colliers, rings,..
See that silver and copper have such intrinsic value as well, but for understandable reasons, their values were considered lower in comparison. And it is important to see that for instance the kings' palaces and the Catholic churches created an enormous constant demand for gold, because it was used extensively to decorate those buildings.
Looking at gold today, the charts seem to show that not all of its value is intrinsic. I'm just guessing that the intrinsic part of its value could be around 30 to 40 percent of its current value, however I'm still looking for something which would support this estimate better than only gut feeling.

One scenario which is at least a little bit realistic is, world economy crashes completely, and the US dollar is going to waste in hyperinflation. We now have to presume that this scenario wouldn't end up in a global war, but can be settled within the given political framework. If this assumption would be true (but this is rather unlikely), the government would come up with a new dollar, which would be set up like 1 new dollar = 1 million old dollars, or similar.
Only in such a scenario, 1 bitcoin could be equivalent to 1 million old dollars, or even more. But the luxury home in your example would be worth something like 1 trillion old dollars then.
Hyperbitcoinization is a libertarian millenials dream which isn't going to happen, sorry to say. Bitcoin couldn't even master Starbucks purchases on a Monday morning, LN won't be able to solve this either. Only the digital gold narrative is a bit more realistic, the question remains whether people are going to trust it on a larger scale.

Companies will create their own in-game currency which they have completely under control. They do it already today, you can either play long and successful to gain scores to buy equipment, or you can take the shortcut and pay money for scores, there's no need to introduce bitcoin or other crypto currency in that loop.

It's religion. The time traveler is the modern version of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost.

They won't believe you but you are right. Look at Bakkt where everybody was so sure that the price would jump up immediately. Look at Litecoin where the halving in August couldn't even stop the general downtrend. Everybody say they are already buying because of the halving, everybody is pointing to the "statistics" of the 2! halvings before - I'm quite sure there will be some disappointment.

You forgot the epic mysterious typo in the last row of the predictions

You need to simplify it in a way that everyone can understand and use it, average users today just want to use something *immediately* - It takes only minutes to open up a PayPal or an AliPay account - bitcoin UX must be able to compete if you want mass adoption. Both companies were already done with mass adoption 10 years after their creation, time is running fast in the digital world.

But it doesn't help that much if the buying power of 1 million hyperinflated dollars is only enough for one banana (the next day it's two millions)

For the first 1,000 years of gold usage, it was only cultic items and jewelry. But feel free to ignore history and logic.
