Yeah I guess so. We don't really have extreme weather though. Less tornados and hurricanes in Canada. Just freezing cold in the winter.

The meme actually does make sense in my view. First of all, it's a meme, so it doesn't have to explicitly depict the message it's trying to send. The general message of improved technology vs just plain old quantity is shown well here imo.

Really sorry this happened to you man. Thanks for sharing the scam. Having private WHOIS, though, is pretty common and doesn't indicate scams at all. I have a lot of websites that I run that use private WHOIS because I was tired of getting 40+ emails a day from indian "SEO" and web design companies.

Unlike ~44 states, for example, which have lots going for them.

You are absolutely correct. A lot of the buyers are blindly in it, and a lot of the non-buyers are just sitting on the sidelines calling for crashes. Its all a bunch of crap. Everyone's a fkn expert all of the sudden. Take everything with a grain of salt, do your own research, make your own decisions.

19 bitcoins would be great to have but a large pizza would also be great to have therefore this is a fair trade and an equal deal for both parties.
