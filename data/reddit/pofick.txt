They should use something more p2p-like for their hosting, Zeronet for example.

YOUTUBE BANNED MY BITCOIN VIDEO... and that's why we need decentralized youtube! I have no one yet, but this network may seems good to you:
Based on Bitcoin cryptography and BitTorrent technology to build a decentralized censorship-resistant network.
You can browse some cool P2P-websites inside the network through this gateway:

Hi! Can we use blockchain as a repo (like github) for a current version of constitution (or bylaw) of an organisation?
The change of block size limit in bitcoin is really the change of bylaw for stakeholders/mangers (miners). Each miner has his weight in this poll (decision making and governance of the company) which is proportional to his hashrate and bandwidth rate. Developers are experts which suggest decisions. Everyone else having bitcoins, except miners are stakeholders of DAO 'Bitcoin' without having rights of managing the company.
That is corporate managing problem indeed!
DAO 'Bitcoin' supplies two main services to its customers. The first service is worldwide money remittances proceeding. The company's own stocks are the mean of payment there. The second service is an investment itself in case of bitcoin's price is rising.
The difference between a corporation and a state is that second one declares that its constitution is allegedly common product and common legacy. If it is true, then every citizen should have an ability to commit a change in the constitution, in case that 50% of the other citizens support this change. Each citizen should have equal rights to make commits regardless of his capital, rating, reputation, etc (if the constitution itself doesn't have other provisions, haha).
The more popular, educated and activated is society, the more attackproof and foolproof constitution it has, and thus the more efforts are needed to infect it by exploits and deliberate mistakes in the constitution in order to enhace corruption.
