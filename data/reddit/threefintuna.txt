At request, I have gone through and fixed the typos that you pointed out. 
* We have updated the TOS to reflect tip refunds within 7 days (not 10).
* The FAQ on topping up now reads, "One of the easiest ways is to use Coinbase, with whom we have a direct integration. Simply click "Buy Bitcoin via Coinbase" from your Money page. Otherwise, there are plenty of resources where you can buy and sell Bitcoins. Once you have Bitcoins, send them to your ChangeTip wallet using your unique address."
* The Fees page has been updated to avoid confusion as to the amount charged by the Bitcoin Network.
* The misspelling of "personalization" has been fixed, along with the stray "you" in our Privacy Policy.
* The [Terms and Conditions page]( is now capitalized to match the formatting of the Privacy Policy. 
Let us know if you find others. We'll be happy to fix them up.

it absolutely is based on an anthropological basis of gift exchange as currency. But Brett Scott's article really capture the heart of all the projects using bitcoin for tipping: generosity, human connection despite anonymity. To quote Scott, "....Anonymous cryptocurrency donations are similar [to tips given to street artist]. They do not aggrandize the tipper, and can be used to express a pure appreciation for the services provided.
