Have you ever thought about the fact that if you were completly new to crypto and read up on all the tech, roadmaps of each coin etc, Bitcoin wouldn't be your first choise? Or are you living in denial? Congrats on making it to stage 2 of the 5 stages of grief though, next up is bargaining, depsression and acceptance.

Our end goal is all the same, get crypto on par with fiat. The thing is, not everyone roots for the same team and everyone is entitled to their own opinion and beliefs. For example, if you invite a fan of one football team on your show, do you really expect him to praise the other team? No. He didn't drill Bitcoin in the ground, he simple expressed his opinion on how he thought BCH is better AT THE MOMENT, wich is true tbh. It will be a different story when Lighting is implemented, untill then, i'm with him.

32MB might seem big today, but what in 10,20 or 30 years?  Maybe one day a quantum processor will be the equivilant of a high end desktop today and allot of people will have one.

I swear to god crypto is like a religion for some people, so fanatic about one coin at the cost of common sense, such shame. Funny how you can love someone one year and hate them the next becouse their way of thinking doesn't fit in your mindset anymore.

Please explain to me how adding Lighting helps with the decentralization of BTC compared to BCH? If for some reason miners would switch to BCH, wouldn't it be just as decentralized as BTC is right now?

This reminds me of that scene in the movie Deep Impact, where the reporter gave up her seat in the shelter and went to be all lovy dovy with her dad on the beach. Sure they were happy with their choise but got smashed by a huge tsunami at 1000km/h while otherpeople went for higher ground.

People were expected X2, now they hop on the next best thing. Since august there have been signs that BCH will jump up. The only reasen you're crying is becouse you're not making money right now and you are jealus of the people who did. But hey, why worry right? Bitcoin will rise again no? Then why are you throwing a tantrum like a kid? Is BCH being pumped right now? Hell yeah! Who would deny that. Will BCH surpass BTC? Honestly no one knows. Start being more rational. You remind me of crazy religious people who get all red and steamy when you try to have a rational conversation with them.

This is like a kid wanting to break another kids toy becouse he's having more fun with it. Grow up already.

Sounds like someone is scared. If you have faith in your version of Bitcoin you wouldn't make such childish posts. You look dumb to everyone.

it's not about "my coin" or "your" coin, i look for value and potential and then invest in it. If i see Bitcoin flipping the downward trend i'll invest in that, same with Litecoin, Monero, etc. Open your eyes man and YOU stop being a fanboy.
