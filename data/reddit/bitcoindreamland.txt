Bitcoin is a paradigm shift. Nothing like it. Casual observers are stretching to compare it to something that they understand, so they can only compare it to a stock price. It's extremely rare to have a stock price exceed $1,000. That is when the bubble talk seemed to hit the mainstream news cycles. Once someone understands that  this is a new form of money (rather than an investment) they begin to see the large picture.

Bitcoin is decentralized. No one group or state actor can insert themselves in a pyramid of control over bitcoin or many cryptos. If TPTB wanted control through digital currency to track transactions, it would certainly not be through a decentralized currency that flows freely between people and states. Centralized actors want centralized control. No doubt though that they will attempt to launch various state coins now that bitcoin has a foothold and has showcased benefits of digital currency.

When you purchase USD $500 in bitcoin, you are purchasing a decimal amount, since that only buys you part of a coin. Today, that is worth .04098360 BTC.

21 million total coins by year 2140. Approx 17 million in existence now. About 3 million lost forever due to allowances for Satoshi's wallet or unrecoverable private keys. About 9-10 million long term holders. So only a float of 4 or 5 million coins moving in/out of market but even that amount will decrease in a positive feedback loop as holders see stratospheric gains and grip more tightly. To change number of total coins, miners would have to agree to expand supply and instantly decrease the value of their holdings, the incentives just don't work. However, a fork could expand the number of decimal places in one bitcoin from 8 to say, 10.

Article text in case of WSJ paywall: 
The fight over bitcoin’s block size is getting testy. Literally. For months now, a raging debate has been roiling the bitcoin industry over whether or not to increase the maximum size of a transaction block of data. The current maximum is 1 megabyte. Gavin Andresen, who heads up bitcoin’s core developer team, has suggested increasing that to 20 megabytes, so as to facilitate the increased traffic the system is processing as bitcoin grows.
That may sound like a dry, technical issue. It is not. It touches upon the cornerstone of the decentralized system – i.e., how best to compensate the miners who run the network and give them the incentives to keep doing so – and it illustrates the sometime chaotic nature of building consensus amid a leaderless consortium. The debate is pitting the core developer group, led by Gavin Andresen, against the inchoate, far-flung miners, and is dragging in virtually everybody who has any stake in the system. It has sparked running battles across reddit and Twitter and the bitcoin message boards.
On Monday evening New York time, a U.K.-based start-up called coinwallet ran its own “stress test” of the bitcoin network, looking to flood the system with transactions in order to make a point: the systems current constraints are too small to handle increased traffic. “Bitcoin is at a breaking point,” they wrote in a post on reddit. “If nothing is done, bitcoin will never be anything more than a costly science project.”
Representatives of coinwallet were not immediately available for comment. The test itself did reach its stated goal of clogging up the system with 200mb worth of transactions, because coinwallet’s servers crashed before they got there. The group said it will run another test in seven days. If the servers don’t crash, we all may learn bitcoin’s real limits.
While the initial test took people by surprise, it’s very similar to a test that Visa Inc. conducts every August of its system. The most recent test, in August 2014, showed the system could handle 56,582 transactions per second (the actual peak volume the previous year was 13,236 transactions per second).
The number of transactions on the bitcoin network has been rising steadily, but has not yet bumped up against its limit. That 1 mb limit – which was put in as an “anti-spam” measure - limits the system to seven transactions per second. On June 18, according to data from Blockchain.info, the system processed 133, 747 transactions – a record high. But that works out to 5,572 transactions per hour, or 92 transactions per minute, or 1.5 transactions per second. So the system isn’t at the breaking point yet, but that’s no reason to wait until it is.
Changing the block size is technically simple. It requires rewriting the bitcoin code. But that change has to be accepted by consensus, because it requires the majority of miners adopted the updated software. If they didn’t, you’d have two different versions of bitcoin running. But changing the block-size limit alters the incentive system for mining, and here’s where the fight heats up.
A larger block-size limit – which could capture more transactions to be processed in one batch – raises the odds that a miner building a bigger block will lose out to one building a smaller block in the race to win the 25 bitcoin the system releases roughly every 10 minutes. That could raise the costs of running a mining operation and lower the profit. Miners who have built a business around the system’s current parameters are, therefore, reluctant to agree to any changes.
Ideally, supply and demand dynamics will sort out the incentive structure, no matter the block size (Mr. Andresen wrote about that here). The trick is getting the current crop of miners to agree to that, even if it goes against their interests in the short term. (Paul Vigna)

WSJ article text in event of paywall:
Case Wallet Inc., just started taking preorders for its credit-card-size device used to securely store and send bitcoin, but it sees much broader applications for its biometric and other security know-how.
The startup has raised $1.5 million in seed funds to explore other uses, especially for identity verification in financial-information access, Case founder and Chief Executive Melanie Shapiro told Venture Capital Dispatch.
“Ultimately, what we’ve built is a secure signing device,” Dr. Shapiro said.
The New York-based startup received its equity seed round from FuturePerfect Ventures, which led the deal, as well as RRE Ventures, High Line Venture Partners and the Rochester Institute of Technology Fund.
Case’s device has a fingerprint scanner, a camera and a GSM (global system for mobile communications) chip. A user scans a QR code with the camera. The QR code contains information, such as the amount and destination, about a bitcoin transaction. Then the user swipes with a finger. The device broadcasts the fingerprint information and an additional key to Case’s servers. The server verifies those keys and generates a new key to complete the transaction.
Unlike online digital wallets, Case’s device has the added security of using biometric data. That ability to identify a specific person, Dr. Shapiro said is the key that has generated interest from financial institutions that are very sensitive about who gets access to their data.
Case began preselling its hardware wallet for $200 each in May. It had capacity for 1,000 wallets and Dr. Shapiro said that it is “almost sold-out.” Case plans to deliver the devices to customers this summer.

The gating factor for many CIOs, beyond common apprehensions about security, is how IT infrastructure must evolve, so that companies can use digital currencies. “It comes down to understanding and embracing more of an open source mentality when it comes to software, and really going to more of a service-oriented architecture that looks to utilize a lot more APIs and plug into a lot of different pieces,” said William Dennings, security chief at bitcoin startup Bitreserve. Incorporating bitcoin requires taking an increasingly service-oriented approach to network architecture in which a number of different applications talk to and provide services to each other. That open architecture has been a critical enabler of cloud computing and the broader “as-a-service” marketplace, as CIO Journal reports.
Is your company adopting digital currency? Leave a comment and let us know how it’s going.

The Ford Motor Company (est. 1903) did not have first mover advantage in the automotive space. Many smaller, boutique manufacturers came online in the late 1890s. Nor did Ford invent the assembly line. However, Ford developed the first **large-scale moving assembly line** with an industrial workforce. The decreased cost put the new technology in reach for millions of horse-drawn carriage owners. Through 1927, Ford produced **14.6 million** Model T vehicles, while other smaller manufacturers stayed custom or released less than 1000 units, and eventually were shuttered. I see parallels between the **500+ altcoins** now and the first cryptocurrency to bridge the adoption chasm and last for the next 100 years, like Ford in 1903.

"The fact that the words bitcoin and blockchain were spoken by chairwoman Yellen in a positive context highlights the importance of emerging financial technology," said Perianne Boring, president of the Chamber.

A few ideas to optimize this service:
* driver uses blockchain to verify identity, vehicle plate and drive history
* use a ratings system to incent drivers to be timely, polite and to present a clean vehicle
* 25% portion of the fare is CLTV held in blockchain for 10 days for new drivers, which motivates driver to be observant to his developing passenger ratings.
* drives are blockchain-recorded and plotted on map at 2 locations (fare beginning, fare ending) using GPS. This reveals drivers general availability, efficiency and typical service area.

I don't really see a correlation between higher volatility and faster cycles. I think that any market has fear/greed cycles that play out recognizably in charts. Most people have an inner "profit thermostat" that makes them uncomfortable when price runs up from $450 to $780 within 30 days and makes them want to protect their gains. Larger investors know that they can drive low-liquidity markets and get the smaller investors out on a positive feedback loop of fear and dropping prices. What is left is the HODLers. That's when the price has no where to go but up. I still can't believe that with only 15.5 million BTC (or less) in circulation, price is only $600.

Journalists will eventually drop the "blockchain, but not bitcoin" narrative and come around IMHO. It is just their way of trying to stay credible when they say "bitcoin" to a wider audience (who vaguely remember hearing something last year about illicit drugs and the suicide of Bitcoin's CEO), so that they are not immediately written off by readers. After all, the only bitcoin stories in the wider media in 2014 were Gox and Silk Road. There is no secure blockchain without bitcoin incentive. Journalists specializing in the crypto space usually don't have this viewpoint, its the journalism in wider circles that uses the mantra.

Analysts at Wedbush, the West Coast brokerage and investment bank, are embracing the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC).
The instrument, which is quoted on the OTCQX over-the-counter market, is the first and only means to buy and sell bitcoin with a standard brokerage account in the U.S. It’s structured as an open-ended trust, and the price of the trust is meant to represent 1/10 of bitcoin’s price. GBTC has been trading a premium since May. The Wall Street Journal  last week highlighted some of the early hiccups associated with trading GBTC.
But it’s a buy for Gil Luria at Wedbush, which appears to be the first Wall Street firm to assign a rating to the trust. He assigns an “outperform” rating and a $40 price target. GBTC added d0.6% to $30.50 on Tuesday.
“We believe bitcoin and its associated blockchain technology have the potential to disrupt the existing financial infrastructure over the next few years.
We see BTC as a financial instrument the likes of which has not previously existed, which requires a new valuation approach. We see BTC as equity in a payment network, much like Visa, MasterCard and PayPal, which we also cover.
However, since BTC does not generate cash flow like equity, we use a commodity-like valuation approach that values each BTC as a ‘packet’ in limited supply that fuels the bitcoin network. The more the bitcoin network is utilized for current and future applications, the more demand for the packet.
By aggregating the utilization of the various applications, we arrive at our $400 BTC price target, which translates to $40 per share of GBTC. This implies ~$6 billion market capitalization, which we would also describe an option on bitcoin supplanting some payment volumes from Visa (V), MasterCard (MA), PayPal (PYPL) and Western Union (WU), who combine for &gt;$300 billion in market cap.
We believe much of the demand for BTC will come from payment applications where bitcoin offers significant benefits over alternatives – online payments (especially cross-border), remittance and micro payments. We believe bitcoin can reduce the cost of online payments from the current 3-8% to &lt;0.5% and for remittance from 5-10% to &lt;1%. Previously impractical, electronic payments of &lt;$1 could broadly change content monetization on the web, possibly supplanting ads.
We see some potential for BTC as a banking alternative in developing or distressed economies, as is becoming evident to citizens of Greece unable to access or transact in their government currency. We also see possible applications for more far reaching applications such as facilitating machine-to-machine transactions (“Internet of Things”) and as an “anchor” for other blockchain technology applications in the securities industry, real estate sector and beyond.”

"From vacation-rental and ride-hailing startups to aerial drones and bitcoin companies, clashes between tech innovators and regulators have exploded in recent years.
As entrepreneurs iterate, legislators have sought to regulate with the goal of protecting consumers–and some argue protecting incumbent interests. This has cost many startups significant time and money even as venture investors continue to back them in a bet that the companies ultimately will prevail.
Seeking to the help its portfolio companies better navigate legal gray areas, venture firm Andreessen Horowitz has hired former Facebook Inc.FB -0.38% General Counsel Ted Ullyot to the newly created position of Partner of Group Policy and Regulatory Affairs.
The addition marks the continued expansion of the firm’s “extra services” with a head count that now outnumbers the investing partners by a ratio of more than four to one. It also highlights Andreessen Horowitz’s assessment that legal imbroglios should no longer be handled on an ad hoc basis and that the number and complexity of such tussles likely will increase."

Article text in case of WSJ paywall:
–A flurry of new payment products targeted at the developing world has revived hopes that bitcoin can gain a foothold in a promising market that has until now eluded the digital currency.
Some of these initiatives deal with one of the main obstacles for bitcoin businesses hoping to crack into the $500 billion global remittance market: price volatility. Although bitcoin’s fees are much lower than those of traditional money transmitters such as Western Union WU -2.04% and Moneygram, the fluctuation in the price can offset that if the value declines before recipients convert bitcoin into their home currency.
Now, some firms are using high-tech hedging strategies to tackle this problem while others are just absorbing the currency risk and charging a fee for it.
Abra, a startup unveiled at last month’s Launch Festival in San Francisco, confronts volatility by turning people’s smartphones into sophisticated, quasi-autonomous financial entities. These devices store money on the phone and then enter into a series of automated “smart contracts” with Abra’s computers — computerized derivative agreements that hedge volatility and lock in the original dollar value. Abra aggregates all these mini contracts into a single daily derivative position that is sold to a large counterparty. This dynamic financial balancing act is constantly going on in the background between the phone, Abra and the market, yet all the user sees is a fixed dollar amount – or that of some other traditional currency – at which the money was originally uploaded.
To allow recipients to cash out, thousands of tellers have signed up in the pilot markets of the U.S. and the Philippines to carry a cash float and dispense with physical notes and coins in return for transfers to their Abra-enabled smartphones, says Bill Barhydt, the firm’s co-founder and chief executive officer.
In a competing move, Robocoin, a leading maker of physical bitcoin ATMs, on Tuesday unveiled its new Romit software, which uses a network of physical bitcoin ATMs, designated kiosks that use web-enabled devices, and texts to recipients’ cellphones to allow rapid cross-border remittance payments. The service charges a flat 4% fee to cover the exchange rate risk borne by the firm.
Coming at the problem from a different direction is Tether, formerly known as Realcoin, which offers a dollar-backed digital token that’s imbedded into bitcoin transactions as a vehicle for transferring fixed dollar value. Unlike Abra or Robocoin, Tether takes on a debt to its customers, contractually promising to keep their digital currency holdings locked one-to-one at the original dollar price. It stands by this promise by building and maintaining a transparently reported reserve in dollars.
Earlier this month, Tether signed a deal with GoCoin, an international bitcoin payment-processing firm, allowing merchants that receive payments in bitcoin to settle their trades in tether tokens instead of a more expensive dollar wire from a bank.
BitReserve also accumulates a transparent reserve to back its fixed-value promise. But it uses a proprietary, cloud-based system rather than bitcoin’s decentralized blockchain ledger as the infrastructure through which users transfer value to each other. Sensing an opportunity in remittances, BitReserve recently signed a deal with Mexico’s Grupo Elektra ELEKTRA.MX +0.91% to use its network of department stores as outlets for funds that Mexican immigrants send home from the U.S.
While those initiatives aim to shield people from bitcoin’s price, other new projects encourage them to own bitcoin outright.
On Tuesday, Latin American social media network Taringa! announced it was partnering with bitcoin wallet provider Xapo to make ad revenue-sharing payments in the digital currency to those among its 75 million users who actively provide popular content.
Also this week, Chilean bitcoin exchange SurBTC launched with an ace up its sleeve: a $40,000 grant from the Chilean government.
Whether any of these projects succeed in building emerging-market adoption for bitcoin remains to be seen. But innovators are clearing going after that market hard. (Michael Casey)
–It’s official, more or less: MIT’s famed Media Lab has become the principal home and funding source for the small team of developers responsible for maintaining and improving bitcoin’s core software.
Gavin Andresen, who bears the title of Chief Scientist for the six-person core development team, announced on his blog Wednesday that he and two other core developers, Wladimir van der Laan and Cory Fields, had moved to the MIT Media Lab’s new Digital Currency Initiative, ending their previous status as employees of the Bitcoin Foundation. The three other core developers, who draw salaries from different employers, will continue in that status.
Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Foundation is going through its own restructuring – with two new leaders at its helm – as it strives to restore an image tarnished by scandal and the mismanagement of funds.
Bitcoin venture capital investor Brock Pierce has been elected Chairman of the Foundation, fresh after businessman Bruce Fenton took over as the new Executive Director replacing Patrick Murck, who resigned earlier this month amid tensions at the financially strapped foundation.
Messrs. Murck and Pierce were among a group of board members who had sought to extract and separate core development funding from the foundation’s unstable political structure. A charter that had given equal votes to members representing individuals and those representing industry was paralyzing decision-making and had left enterprise donors, which provided 85% of the foundation’s funds, unwilling to continue underwriting the body.
Mr. Murck’s plan was to create a separate, industry-funded institution to finance development while leaving the foundation to focus on promotional efforts, information and public outreach. But that strategic plan was scuttled after dissident board member Olivier Janssens released a statement declaring the foundation to be “effectively bankrupt” and calling for an alternative overhaul model in which core development would be funded through a separate crowd-funding mechanism.
Mr. Janssens’ plan never saw the light of day, either – mostly because MIT Media Lab Director Joicho Ito announced an alternative idea earlier this month: his institution would function as a reliably funded, neutral home for bitcoin development. Mr. Ito’s initiative appears to have placated industry-based donors eager to see a long-term commitment to core development.
For now, the three developers will be paid out of MIT Media Lab’s central budget, which is itself funded by donations from companies. But in an interview, Brian Forde, who will head the Digital Currency Initiative, said “we’ve had an outpouring of people who are interested in supporting it as well.”
Before taking this position, Mr. Forde was senior advisor for mobile and data innovation at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. His involvement and those of other respected experts – including legendary encryption expert Ron Rivest and MIT economist Simon Johnson – have been welcomed by many in the bitcoin community, who see a chance to earn more legitimacy for the digital currency. It stands in contrast to the Bitcoin Foundation, which has been undermined by infighting, financial mismanagement and legal scandals.
Still, Mr. Pierce said “the foundation isn’t going anywhere, though we have a lot of work to do.” With Mr. Fenton’s appointment, he argued, “the board has become functional.” Mr. Pierce added, “We did the right thing in choosing to spin out Core Dev.” (Michael Casey)

In case of WSJ pay wall:
"A rapidly growing Latin American social network will start paying its content-providing members in bitcoin, offering a service that supporters of the digital currency hope could spur mainstream adoption in the region.
Launched Tuesday by Taringa!, whose 75 million unique users  puts it second only to Facebook FB +1.22% in the region, the project combines an ad revenue-sharing model akin to that of Google Inc.’s YouTube with the Argentine-owned site’s unique ranking system to incentivize popular content. The system was developed in partnership with Xapo, a Palo Alto, Calif.-based bitcoin wallet and custodial service provider.
Taringa! c0-founder Hernán Botbol said his firm had been wanting to introduce a revenue-sharing model to add to an existing, non-financial incentive system that encourages popular content and helped his firm achieve rapid network growth. However, Latin America’s “horrendous,” underdeveloped financial system made it impossible to deliver funds, he said. Credit-card networks aren’t developed enough and bank account penetration isn’t deep enough for users to receive payments in their traditional currencies.
“We have had this on our mind, mainly because we think we can bring more people to create great content and also because we think that it’s fair, given that all this that we have is just because our users are creating the content,” Mr. Botbol said.  “But we never were able to do that because the infrastructure is horrendous – even if you send someone a check, [without sufficient banking services] they don’t know what to do with that.”
Taringa!’s agreement with Xapo is also designed to give content providers the opportunity to use and share their earned bitcoins within the community. They will have the capacity to send tips to one and another and Taringa! itself will facilitate purchases of consumer goods – starting with digitally delivered virtual products such as games, said Mr. Botbol.
On Friday, Mr. Botbol outlined the project to a small luncheon gathering of venture capitalists and bitcoin businessmen at venture firm Andreessen Horowitz in Menlo Park, Calif.  There, it prompted discussion about how such projects might expand the transactional use of bitcoin, which after rapid growth among a mostly tech-savvy core of early adopters has struggled to make a sizable dent in developed-country payment markets, where bank-issued credit and debit cards dominate. Bitcoin enthusiasts’ hope is that projects such as the Taringa!-Xapo partnership – which focus on ways bitcoin can be used where the traditional financial system is unable to deliver – could be an impetus for wider adoption in the developing world, where many believe digital currencies have their best chance of success.
The deal is part of a new emerging-markets-focused strategy for Xapo, which has become the biggest custodian of digital currencies in the world, mostly by developed economy-based long-term investors in bitcoin. In an interview, Xapo CEO Wences Casares said he sees fresh opportunities in the developing world, “where people are using bitcoin not as a store of value or an investment but as a way to spend on online.”
Bitcoin can challenge the traditional financial model in many such places, Mr. Wences said, because that bank-centric system has failed to facilitate e-commerce, even though it’s something that people clearly want.
In Latin America, where well-functioning web sites of the U.S. are visible but inaccessible, “people can see that you can you transact, but they cannot actually transact,” said Mr. Casares. “It’s a little obscene; it’s like they’re teasing you.”

Text in case of paywall:
"Rumors of the lack of women in the bitcoin industry have been greatly exaggerated.
The bitcoin community—the developers, executives, venture capitalists, policy wonks, academics, and even bloggers who work in, engage with, and support the decentralized technology and the digital currency—has a diversity problem.
It’s no worse than in the technology industry writ large, though some people disagree. Whatever the case, women are very much a minority in the business of bitcoin. But there are more of them than a Fusion piece this week would have you believe.
The story, entitled, “Why bitcoin’s male domination will be its downfall,” garnered fast and furious responses on Twitter from people in the bitcoin community who disputed author Felix Salmon’s representation of the issue. (“Effectively zero,” he says at one point; an “almost complete absence” at another. ) Using Nathaniel Popper’s forthcoming bitcoin book Digital Gold as a jumping-off point, Salmon wrote, “If you are a woman involved with Bitcoin, you are invariably going to get treated like an outsider.” Digital Gold focuses on the origins of bitcoin and a small handful of its earliest characters. Popper told Salmon he put effort into “trying to find a woman who was involved in some substantive way,” but as Salmon (not Popper) says, the result was “Zero. Nothing. Zilch.”
That string of strong words is a bit misleading. It refers to the involvement of women in the very early days of bitcoin. Nowadays, the landscape is different. Popper, for his part, was mostly silent on the issue—but replied to one critical tweet by saying, “I would wait and read the book before you conclude what I say in it.”
On Twitter, bitcoin folks were quick to reply to Salmon.
The bitcoin industry has what Brian Forde, director of digital currency for MIT Media Lab, calls a “pale male” problem. (At a roundtable discussion about BitLicense this week, all of the bitcoin executives and policy pundits were male—the only female in the room was a reporter covering the talk.) An ongoing Coindesk survey first posted in March asks, “Is the Bitcoin community just young, white and male?” A separate survey from 2013 concluded that 96% of bitcoin “users” are male.
But there are quite a few women in the business of bitcoin—and while they may be heavily outnumbered by their male counterparts, they are hardly standing on the sidelines. “I might be a special case, but in my experience, I’ve only been welcomed and encouraged in this space,” says Andrea Castillo, an economic researcher at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. “I’ve never felt there were barriers presented to me because of my gender. If anything, I think people have been nicer to me because of it.” Castillo and her former colleague Jerry Brito worked together on bitcoin’s first policy primer—Brito now serves as executive director for Coin Center, a nonprofit watchdog working to help influence policy and regulation of the industry.
On Twitter, Brito responded to Salmon’s article by pointing out that Castillo herself is one of the most influential women in bitcoin policy, along with his Coin Center colleague Robin Weisman.
“You can always look at a ratio on paper,” says Castillo, “but for me the more interesting question is, Are there any barriers? Are there people who don’t want them [women or people of color] to join and be involved? I don’t see that at all. I see everyone saying, ‘Are you interested in bitcoin? Join us, get involved.” I mean, it’s an open-source project.”
M.K. Lords is another vocal woman in the industry, and one of many people who are actively involved in the bitcoin community without working full-time at a bitcoin company. Lord’s day job is at a brokerage that accepts bitcoin for non-precious metals. In her free time she runs a bitcoin blog, hosts a bitcoin radio program, and has assembled multiple bitcoin conferences. “To say there are no women in bitcoin is sexist because it diminishes all the very active women in the space,” she says. “Women are accepted with open arms in the bitcoin industry. Yes, you deal with similar culture in tech at large, it is mostly male, but I haven’t experienced any kind of sexism. At my conferences, I had 40% more women in full speaker slots than other conferences.”
There are in fact so many women working in the industry, Lords says, that, “if you ask three different women who the prominent women in bitcoin are, you’ll get different names each time. There really are a lot of us.”
In that spirit, here are just 10 of the prominent female voices in bitcoin. It’s by no means an exhaustive list (nor a ranking), but it helps to push back on the assertion that women have been sidelined in the growing business of digital currency.
– Elizabeth Rossiello, CEO, BitPesa
Rossiello’s company focuses on Africa, allowing for quick and inexpensive money transfers to the continent.
– Cindy McAdam, president and general counsel at Xapo
With $40 million in funding, Xapo is one of the most prominent bitcoin wallet services. McAdam, a former executive at other mobile payments executives, is one of its highest ranking executives.
– Elizabeth Ploshay, account manager at BitPay
A former D.C. person with a background in P.R., Ploshay became a contributor at Bitcoin Magazine before leaving to join payment provider BitPay. She also now sits on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation.
– Connie Gallippi, founder and executive director of BitGive
Gallippi is betting that charity is an avenue that can help fix bitcoin’s mainstream reputation.
– Victoria Van Eyk, VP of community development at ChangeTip
A founder of the Bitcoin Strategy Group, a consultancy, van Eyk also works at ChangeTip, a bitcoin startup that allows for peer-to-peer bitcoin micro-payments via Twitter.
– Pamela Morgan, CEO, Third Key Solutions
Morgan, an attorney, created Empowered Law, a “crypto-friendly law practice,” and also runs Third Key, which works with bitcoin startups on multi-signature security measures.
– Fereshteh Forough, founder, Code to Inspire
Forough has been key in bringing bitcoin awareness to Afghanistan, where she co-created the Women’s Annex. She was a 2013 TED speaker in New York and now runs Code to Inspire, which teaches young women in Afhganistan to code.
– Catheryne Nicholson, CEO, BlockCypher
A former U.S, Naval officer, Nicholson is co-founder and CEO of BlockCypher, one of a handful of platforms for building applications on bitcoin’s block chain.
– Elizabeth Stark, entrepreneur-in-residence, StartX
A former professor of tech policy at Stanford and Yale, Stark was key in the movement against SOPA. She is entrepreneur in residence at the non-profit accelerator StartX, and is part of Start Bitcoin, a group of entrepreneurs advocating for digital currency technologies.
– Blythe Masters, CEO, Digital Asset Holdings
Perhaps one of the biggest names to have jumped into digital currency, Masters left her post as head of global commodities at JPMorgan last year. In March, she was named chief executive at this recently launched trading platform.
The perception that there is a dearth of women in bitcoin harms efforts to change it. “It’s so easy to paint bitcoin with a broad brush, but there’s a lot of details people leave out,” Lords says. “In fact, when there are articles about a problem with women, I hear mostly from the men, saying, ‘This is crazy! We love the women in bitcoin and we want more of them.'”
Pua Pyland, who runs the blog “The Bitcoin Wife” and was one of the only female voices in bitcoin early on, told Fortune back in February that when she first started her blog, “it was a very different landscape. The community was small, and there were no forward-facing female advocates. My husband and I were early adopters, and I was looking to provide a different voice and perspective on Bitcoin…. Fast-forward to today. There are so many strong female voices in Bitcoin, and they are all very positive advocates to get more women involved.”

You may have already heard of this secure digital currency used by a community of 7+ million consumers and growing. In fact, the NYSE, Nasdaq, Dell, Expedia, Virgin, Overstock and Bloomberg have either jumped in with venture capital or have started accepting Bitcoin directly. Merchants have the added benefit of no chargebacks with Bitcoin and pay only a fraction of VISA/MC/AMEX fees, which puts more money in your bottom line. I hope to hear from you soon about Bitcoin acceptance at (Company X).

"This modest decline (in branches) pales in comparison to the technological change in banking and payment processing and raises the question of whether or not banks are transforming their delivery systems fast enough to accommodate changing client needs," KBW wrote.

If the home is in the US, you would want to enlist the assistance of a title company or attorney to handle the buyer's funds and coordinate an insured exchange of the signed deed for the escrowed funds. Finding a title company to do this might be a little challenging at this early stage of bitcoin maturity since their insurance underwriters may not have done this yet. However, your parents have an excellent opportunity to get some media exposure for their home (headline "Home in Collegeville Being Sold for Bitcoin") and the real estate agent (if he or she is creative) would see the benefits of looking in to this as well.

Bitcoin only knows you as a string of random numbers and letters and doesn't care about your private details.
4) Think about how archaic a paper check is. Postal mail, transport, processing, verification and 5+ days to transact. Bitcoin is instant.
5) Bitcoin is revolutionizing payments, remittances and strongly favors the individuals while simultaneously disempowering corrupt/self-interested officials/governments at the top of the fiat money pyramid that drive the inflation/war cycles.

I appreciate the creative thought and acknowledge that market makers in most markets attempt to drive the price down. However, a $3.7B market cap (equivalent to 4 professional sports stadiums) is a minuscule target if a group of manipulators really wanted to crash bitcoin . It could happen at much higher prices, but I suspect that the minor price drops in recent weeks ($230-$260 range) are just miners cashing out coins to meet overhead expenses. They will hoard those coins once prices begin to climb (especially with the 2016 halving next year). Buy and hold.

PayPal and credit cards work great for convenience, but there are problems at the macro-level: 1) issuers are continually in leap-frog race against thieves to prevent fraud 2) High fees to merchant (2.5% - 7%) which drive consumer prices up to compensate 3) money (read:debt) is literally conjured into existence (against regulated banking reserve requirements) when you swipe your credit card. This fuels inflation. 4) Banks and merchants aggregate your purchase information in big data to sell. 5) impossible to send money peer-to-peer like cash without an intermediary 6) credit cards don't serve populations in developing countries well because of lack of infrastructure. Digital currencies like bitcoin resolve these issues.

SHENZHEN, China—In a warren of tiny shops beneath grimy residential towers, a white-haired man selling Snickers bars and fizzy drinks from a kiosk no larger than a cashier’s booth is figuring out a way to move $100,000 out of China.
That is twice what Chinese are allowed to send out of the country in a year. Licensed banks won’t do it. But middlemen like Mr. Chen, perched in his mini-mart at the front lines of a vast underground currency-exchange and offshore-remittance network, can and often will.
“There’s never a certainty that these things can be done,” said Mr. Chen, who declined to give his full name. “But, usually, when things get stricter, the fee will just be a bit higher.”
Facing a turbulent stock market and a weakening economy, many Chinese are trying to move money offshore. That spells business for operations that can end-run capital controls.
No official data track the underground transfers, but central-bank officials who attempt to say that underground banks handle about 800 billion yuan ($125 billion) annually, and more than usual this year.
One sign of unusually high activity in underground banks is a drop in China’s foreign-exchange reserves, an indicator of demand for hard currency. Reserves fell by a record $93.9 billion in August and $43 billion more in September, though part of the reason was central-bank selling to support the yuan.
Often hidden behind the façades of convenience stores and tea shops, they cater to a clientele ranging from corrupt officials hiding gains to middle-class Chinese trying to buy overseas property. All believe their money is safer abroad or can bring a higher return, a sentiment that has deepened since this summer’s stock-market plunge.
New York real-estate agent Jiang Jinjin said she has handled nearly 2,000 residential-property purchases this year for Chinese families with children at Columbia University. “I didn’t sleep much this summer. Too many kids looking for apartments,” she said.
Some customers rely on relatives and friends to carry cash over on repeated trips, she said, and some set up U.S. companies. Such firms can be used to overpay for imports, experts on underground banking say. Ms. Jiang said her company checks the provenance of money used to buy real estate.
The outflows have put underground bankers in China in the cross hairs of financial regulators. China’s capital controls were set up to keep funds onshore when the country was starved for investment. Officials consider them still necessary, to prevent sharp outflows of the kind that shocked developing economies in the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Also, too much cash going out could complicate efforts to stimulate growth through interest-rate cuts.
 ENLARGE
“It’s a sign of a loss of confidence in China’s economic outlook, and it certainly makes it more difficult for the central bank to achieve their reform goals,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at research firm Capital Economics.
For years, underground banking thrived in Shantou and Chaozhou, fiercely entrepreneurial coastal cities that were rife with smuggling, counterfeiting and drug and gun running. Much of the activity has moved to cities near the border with Hong Kong and Macau, former foreign colonies with more-open financial systems. Once mainland money gets to Hong Kong, for instance, it can go pretty much anywhere in the world.
Sometimes, large sums are divided into legally allowed amounts and then channeled out of the mainland via hundreds of bank accounts controlled by the underground banker. Underground banks also can match yuan deposited with them on the mainland with equivalent amounts in foreign currency paid into a client’s bank account elsewhere.
These informal networks, like hawala agents in the Arab world, also enable Chinese workers overseas who can’t open regular bank accounts to send funds back to China.
The Chinese government says it isn’t rattled by the current bout of outflows, which top officials describe as “normal.”
Another sign of a pickup in underground activity: Investment in foreign commercial property by Chinese is on track to surpass last year’s $10.5 billion, according to U.S. property-services firm CBRE Group.

The Chinese Ministry of Public Security said in August it was stepping up a campaign against underground banks, contending “gray capital” spirited out worsened the summer stock swoon.
The crackdown has made underground-bank runners much less visible on Shenzhen’s Xixiang Pedestrian Street. But a walk along the street turned up one, whom shop owners nodded toward when asked who was a runner. It was a young man in yellow loafers named Zhuang.
“Xixiang used to have so many people who would change money for you,” Mr. Zhuang said, at his spot in an alley between a bakery and a clothing store. “A lot of people have been caught.”
In June, Shenzhen police raided an underground bank on the street, arresting 31 and seizing 1,087 accounts holding 12 billion yuan.
The case offered an underground-banking primer. It began in 2012 when Chan Tat, an elderly Hong Kong businessman, sought to move 63 million yuan from his mainland business to Hong Kong for his retirement, according to an account given by Shenzhen police.
Mr. Chan tapped a friend at a commercial bank, who turned to a Shenzhen underground bank. It split the money into three batches. Each was divided into dozens of smaller chunks, then routed to separate bank accounts controlled by the underground bank, before being wired to Hong Kong. Once in Hong Kong, the money was regrouped in an account controlled by Mr. Chan.
All except for eight million yuan he found missing. Mr. Chan, who couldn’t be reached for comment, tipped off Chinese authorities, according to the police account. It isn’t known what has happened to the 31 people arrested.

With direct remittances under scrutiny, runners say a preferred method is matchmaking: Give the underground bank a sum, and a matching sum appears in Hong Kong, minus a cut of anywhere between 0.3% and 3%. No money physically or electronically crosses the border; the match is built on networks on both sides controlled by the underground bank.
The networks make use of family and village ties, said a researcher in the central-bank’s anti-money-laundering unit. “People create and control hundreds of accounts by going into villages to buy national identification cards” from the poor, the researcher said. The accounts surface and vanish.
In a fraud case in Hong Kong courts, prosecutors described how a man named Yang Sigai allegedly set up and then closed three bank accounts there. Though none was open longer than seven months, more than 1,000 transfers totaling about $60 million passed through them, according to court records.
The business was upended after a batch of incoming funds allegedly included $1 million bilked in a phone scam from a Canadian-Chinese man. After he alerted Hong Kong police, they traced the funds to Mr. Yang, who was convicted of fraud, a decision he is appealing. He couldn’t be reached.
The underground banks near Shenzhen’s railway station are more cautious now but undaunted. When asked about transferring $100,000 offshore, a store operator in the back room of a cigarette shop ruled out electronic transfers, offering instead to have people physically mule it across in small batches.
“The policy pressure is high this year, so the risk is higher,” he said. “Unless you know people.”

Thank you. Agreed. Mind expands each time I hear him describe where this is headed.

"Operation Twist" was effectively QE3, so we are looking at having completed **4 rounds** of quantitative easing. They just gave it a different moniker so as not to panic the herd.

LMAO! Yes, there are scams, but this is likely a sincere post from KobiOKC. Worth the effort to get people talking about using it and not buying the "Silk Road" narrative. Wanting some goodwill to go exponential :-)

If I desired to reveal a hidden 4 digit number (or 4 letters) in a hash, I could hash a million first and last names (Mike, Mary, John, Satoshi...) until I saw the desired 4 digit sequential number (letters) in the hash. Then choose the corresponding name.

Here is an earlier thread that might provide some ideas. Good luck!

What percentage of the brick/mortar merchants that you have used are ready to quickly accept your bitcoin within, say, under 10 seconds? I have had multiple cashiers call in to the back to the proprietor who emerges and scrambles to open a bitcoin wallet app on his personal mobile -OR- the employee asks me to return later to use bitcoin when the boss/manager returns to the store.

Low volume in recent days. Flat price and low volatility could be good signs. My spidey sense says that institutional buyers are on the sidelines until the market reacts after the March 5th US Marshals auction of the 50K BTC.

Good spot for lunch or dinner. Have visited 3x and used BTC each time. Try the garlic knot bread with your craft brew and grinders.

Is this in response to John McAfee's central Washington state hydro mining project with MGT Capital?

Regardless of the politics, if my small BTC donation combined with others gets a Newsom mention about his campaign's BTC success on a radio show or TV sound bite, it was worth it.

Honorable proposal, but the concept of math-backed crypto and this messy bitcoin evolution is more desirable because the human ego component has consistently corrupted our existing (centralized) government models. Decentralization, not centralization, is key. Hang on to this bumpy ride and bitcoin will morph exponentially like mold in a petri dish.

21 million is the hard cap but it could theoretically be changed with consensus. Almost impossible to conceive that it would though. Miners would not agree on a fork to increase the supply of coins that would decrease the (dollar, yen, yuan, euro) value of their own holdings. Incentives and economic self-interest is the glue that holds the 21 million cap in place. A cap increase has the same likelihood as you giving fiat money from your leather wallet to wealthy, unknown faceless strangers who you would never see or meet with no expectation of repayment. There is no benefit to you to agree to those terms, so the money stays in your wallet.

Feels eerily like we are on the edge of a significant announcement with a headline similar to "Google begins bitcoin integration with Gmail" or "Reserve Bank of New Zealand announces it owns 4% of available bitcoin."
