Ya I wouldn’t worry, I know it is odd having your coins disappear into limbo but you will eventually get them in one of the two wallets. Always check the mempool before sending a fee, I use

I’m tired of hearing about various shit on the news yet I don’t get on the internet and throw temper tantrums about it because I’m, ya know, an adult. And gpu prices going up is simple supply and demand in a free market. Also there’s various legitimate uses for bitcoin and crypto like payment systems for example

You sound like such a douche with that “sheep following the HODL meme” line 
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:01:49
Let’s see if this gets as much press coverage as it did when they removed it

The ultimate hodler method

Similar thing happen to me when I had to cancel my card cuz it was stolen. The new card was getting declined when trying to use coinbase and I had to call my bank and specifically tell them to allow coinbase transactions. Lady told me the coinbase website is flagged as suspicious or fraud. I’d call your bank and tell them to allow coinbase transactions

I have Adblock for phone also. Works well for me

Tough to buy a dip when you have to wait days for a bank transfer. Buying something with a credit card and paying it off is different then buying an amount a person can’t afford to immediately pay off in hopes the coin increases in value

The txs in mempool just dropped significantly in the last hour or two so I’d recheck where your coins are 
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:44:59
Sounds like your fees were too low to be mined so the tx is stuck in the pool waiting to be mined. It’ll either get mined when the mempool drops or it’ll eventually be dropped from mempool and the coins will be back in your original wallet that you sent the transaction from

There still will be people out here explaining why this is actually the real end because of x and y

I’m dumb for saying you sound like a douche ? The hodl meme has made people millionaires, you’ve been in crypto for a few months and think you know something people don’t? You don’t know shit. Bitcoin has issues like it always has, but it has still gone up in spite of those issues.

After that dip bitcoin is only up 150% this month. Pack it up and sell everything its dead boys 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:20:11
Bitcoin just had 40% of its value shaved off in a few days, people are seeing 1000s, 10,000s etc of dollars disappear for the time being and your wondering why some people arnt nice enough ? Have some self awareness man. Try again in a few weeks and I’m sure if you’ll see more friendly people

Doesn’t matter what bitcoins price is by then, Bircoin is what the bet is over

@_date: 2018-02-17 02:58:07
