Sounds like consensus to me. Probably a little weird looking to you.

That’s how you took this post? Seriously?

Why would anyone do anything but accumulate Bitcoin right now?

Shoot this might get buried by rubber neckers

I disagree, your coins will exist whether you want them to or not. Not selling would by default mean you’re locking up supply that could be dumped and reduce the demand in the buy book I.e. you’ll wind up HODLing and empowering s2xs primary network effect without meaning to.

Not catching the logic here. Selling s2x post fork for btc helps Bitcoin. Is there a counter argument to this here?

Hope they get rekt with the rest of the Bitcoin shorts

Yeah, his chances of winning that bet outright are toast.  Why he ever supported something that will likely just fracture the small Bcash community is beyond me. I wouldn’t be happy with him i was one of those folks. Come back to Bitcoin friends, we’ll wash your strong hands of prior transgressions.

I’ve noticed the upvotes fluctuate rapidly up and down on this post throughout the day.

My initial strategy will be to simply dump all B2X in exchange for BTC. Then resume dollar cost averaging into BTC per usual. Any thoughts?
