That isn't unusual and says very little about the state of affairs. Developers always complain about things being a mess, largely because ~~we~~ they think ~~we~~ they can do better.
What speaks volumes is the source control, or rather the lack thereof.

You can't blame yourself man. Thanks to the FDIC, we've grown accustomed to knowing that banks are a "safe" place to put money. While I recognize that mtgox wasn't a bank, it certainly registered that way in my consciousness. 
If you listen to people here, they'll argue day in and day out that you should have known. They would have you do the digital equivilant of the great depression era 'saving': bury your coin in your backyard stuffed inside a can.
After shit hit the fan, the "I told you so's" flooded the net with a god awful amount of gut-emptying information about mtgox. Speaking for myself, I sure as hell wouldn't have trusted them with my money had I known half of what was unveiled in the weeks that followed but I'm sure the same applies to you. 
My point is simply this: the adage of hindsight being 20/20 is incredibly relevant here. There's still hope for at least a partial return so cheers mate.

A link to when it actually happens would have been nice.

Oh my god. This truly just defined for me how inept this guy is. 
I'm no longer the least bit surprised this happened. I'm now blown away that he was able to keep the scam going for so long.

This. This truly defines how much of a bumbling fool Karpeles is. He owned a site with the capacity to churn out god-awful amount of money. If done properly, his endeavour could have seriously benefitted the currency in which he professed so much faith in all the while making him a billionaire.  Instead the asshat was worried about a fucking cafe. 
Oh, and he was "hacking" up cash register? He was going to sling around some shitty php for some desktops with card readers or scanners? 
This Guy.

Ah, that makes a world of difference.
