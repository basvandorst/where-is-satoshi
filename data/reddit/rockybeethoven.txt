Um, this thread started with a guy comparing the price of a gun in 1960 with today's prices.
My post was a reply to that, trying to show how nonsensical that comparison is.
The graph above is equally nonsensical. It shows how much a dollar could buy (in terms of a standardized basket) back then and now, but it doesn't show how many dollars are earned or owned by the people.
It suggests people's real income has decreased by orders of magnitude, when in fact it has increased by more than 20% even for the poorest since 1960

It's an advantage if he wants to obfuscate his income to evade paying taxes
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:11:57
This graph is not important. It is factual yet it's worthless without context. 
The decrease of the value of the individual dollar is what made it possible for everyone to earn a higher income in real terms. 
The 20% - 100% higher (compared to 1960) real household income made possible by moderate inflation is the disposable income that you now can invest in a speculative asset like bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:01:08
Yes. You are easily manipulated by flashy graphs like the guy I initially responded to.
It is completely irrelevant how much one dollar buys today as compared with then, because it doesn't take into account how many dollars everyone owns and earns today compared with 1960. Serious research shows that even the poorest 5% are 20% better off today despite individual dollars losing 95% of value.
That's the beauty of modern monetary policy. It incentivizes economic activity which benefits the society as a whole.
Bitcoin is limited supply and ultimately deflationary and would not allow such a development.
This why all 200+ governments in the world have abolished currencies whose supply they cannot control and introduce fiat.
Therefore this graph is really irrelevant.
On the other hand, if you want to talk about it from a investment perspective only: Bitcoin is a speculative investment. People who hodl since one month ago lost 30% against USD. Sounds like a shitty store of value, right?

Dude, if you clicked "Deposit" in your USD wallet, then you have asked Coinbase to top up your USD wallet with money from your bank account.
You should have clicked "Withdraw", if you wanted to send money from Coinbase to your bank.

No I don't have to. 
I would like to use a basket of goods of services that is typically consumed by an average person today and compare it to the typical basket of goods and services back then.
Just because I consume the same amount of bread like a person 57 years ago does not mean I can ignore a shitload of other things that I now have, and that a person back then didn't have.
That's why actually **nobody** uses *one* thing to make such comparisons. Every country and every scientist uses a standardized basket to make such comparisons (relevant for USA, the [CPI basket]( ).
Whoever uses one product to analyse purchasing power is either manipulative (like me with my computer comparison) or actually trying to analyse something different.
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:46:35
Computers existed in 1960 so no, that's definitely not the argument I'm making. 
My argument is you are comparing apples and oranges. 
Guns are hardly relevant as measure for purchasing power by the way. Housing, energy, healthcare, education, food, transportation,communication,... those are the relevant things that make up the greatest part of the expenditures of an average person.

What's so difficult to understand indeed?
The fruit is not taxed if you don't make profit.
If you make profit, only the profit is taxed, the amount you invested is not taxed again.
Every dollar earned is taxed exactly once, there is no double taxation in this scenario.

A bank can absolutely not unilaterally take or freeze your money. There must be at least some other party involved, typically some KYC/AML regulations passed by the government beforehand, or a law enforcement agency asking the bank to freeze your money for some reason.
Just opening more channels sounds trivial but it isn't.
First of all they need to pay transaction fees per channel for opening and closing, which might be expensive.
Second, the money they'd like to spend is still locked until the timeout is reached (144 blocks = 1 day?). They can't use it to fund other channels until it arrives.

There is no [top-up]( Not at the moment at least.
You need to open a new channel.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:04:55
They are only taxing the profit you make with your investment. 
The profit is only the additional dollars you have after your investment was deducted from your revenue.
If you invested 10k and sell your fruit for 11k, 10k is not taxable because that's expenses.
Only 1k is profit. They will tax only those 1k of new income.

Profit from capital gain is income as is receiving money for working in someone else's enterprise. 
Why would you tax one (which is the only source of income for the vast majority of people) and not the other (which is only an important source of income for the richest among us).
I have no idea how you've come up with all those other questions. You seem to be ignorant of the basics of human societies in general and democratic decision making in particular.
There are different models, but if you live in the US or the EU, you have democratic elections of legislative bodies, which may elect the head of government.
In some countries the head of government is the president and is elected directly.
The candidates present their programs and the most popular ones get elected. The winners of the election compile from their programs a set of measures as a government program.
It's a compromise between the different interests and needs of the population. These programs need to be financed. Financing is mostly done via taxes and partly via debt.
How taxation is distributed across different parts of the population and the economy is decided by the elected legislative and government who represent the polulation who.elected them.
Fairness is definitely a factor when deciding who and what to tax and how much. Taxation is therefore a very complex system of laws regulating rates, exemptions, procedures etc. which are subject to frequent changes and take up a large chunk of each government's work.
I hope this gives you a vague idea. Yet should you live in a democratic country and are older than 14, I am shocked by your ignorance and would strongly advise you to start reading some quality news papers and watching the news.
Rereading your school books might help as well. Some of them definitely contain all the info necessary to answer your questions.

As for the chemical stability, you might have a point there.
The durability could probably be improved by removing all air from the waterproof box. If no water and oxygen are present, there is no danger of oxidation and corrosion.

Without fiat, bitcoin wouldn't exist at all. You need fiat to pay for the electricity or purchase mining hardware.
Fiat currencies existed well before the internet (since renaissance one could argue). The computing power required to keep track of money creation by a central bank is negligible compared to transaction sytems such as Visa or SWIFT.
Many countries with comparably small armies have very well functioning fiat currencies. Tiny Switzerland is a very good example. Their army is ridiculous compared to their neighbors' (e.g. Germany, Italy, France), they haven't waged war for more than 150 years, they have a very well functioning direct democracy yet the Swiss franc is one of the world's reserve currencies.
All in all you have written a load of nonsense.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:06:30
As long as Nvidia is not selling their chips for bitcoin and chinese electricity providers don't accept bitcoin, you definitely need fiat for mining equipment and for electricity.
You may purchase mining equipment using bitcoin as a vehicle to transfer value, but you have bought it with fiat and the producer will also convert it into fiat to pay his workers, suppliers, shareholders...
If Switzerland is a bad example, other examples are e.g. Iceland, Sweden, Norway and a bunch of EU countries pre-Euro such as Austria or the Netherlands.
There's Singapore in Asia as well, although they are somewhat authoritarian.
The only reason we use fiat today is because we've had literally centuries to compare  different forms of money and this is the one efficient enough to enable modern economy.
Yes we are forced to use our respective currencies to pay our taxes. 
That's called legal tender and is absolutely not specific for fiat currencies. 
Any legal tender be it fiat, precious metal, crypto or anything else is established by law. 
If tomorrow our governments declared gold legal tender, that would be the only reason why we would carry pounds of metal around. 
The quality of legal tender is what makes a currency a universally accepted medium of exchange. Without that quality, there is no guarantee that your currency will be universally accepted no matter how valuable (you think) it is.
In the global context the "hegemonic politics" means maintaining an economy that will guarantee the value of the currency. The fact that $1000 will buy you a top-notch cell phone or a mid-range laptop in every economic situation short of a global meltdown, means that the currency is stable.
It is backed by tangible assets. It preserves its value over time and is therefore preferred as a medium of exchange over currencies that are not as readily or stably convertible into goods and services.
 
The gulf monarchies don't price their crude oil in dollars because the US is holding a gun to their heads, but because it makes economic sense. There is almost nothing you can buy with Rial or Dirham. You can buy absolutely everything with $. They're also selling in Yuan.
The Euro is existing without a state. There is no military enforcing its use in trade all over the world, yet a very large chunk of the global trade is done in euros. 
It is a currency in the whole eurozone based not on pressure from a hegemon, but on agreement between sovereign countries, in many cases backed by referenda (i.e. direct democracy).
It is centrally regulated by a supra-national central bank that is independent from political directive.
It is also the currency in non-EU countries such as Montenegro or Andorra, which simply have declared it legal tender without being able to create or regulate it.
Yes you need fiat to buy mining equipment and electricity.
If Switzerland is a bad example what about Iceland, Norway or Sweden.
You need to learn the difference between fiat money and legal tender. While fiat gets it's value through being legal tender, any sort of money needs to be legal tender to be universally accepted as medium of exchange.
Fiat is created by law, yet its value is derived by how widely accepted it is and how stable the underlying economy is.
Military or other threat from a mighty "hegemon" is not a necessary precondition for global acceptance as demonstrated by the euro and the swiss franc.

You should suck out all the air from the bag to avoid oxidation.

Yeah, you can't safely store your recovery seed, without laser etching it into 1kg of metal.
What concerns me about this guide however, is that it does not explain how to safely store the 1kg of metal plates.
I would propose digging a hole in your backyard, placing the metal plates in a waterproof box (to avoid corrosion), putting the box in the hole and then position something unsuspicious but heavy on top, for example a concrete birdbath, to mark and secure the spot.
It should be done at night, so that noone sees you putting the metal plates in the hole.

If you run an email or a web server you don't have immediately child pornography on it.
If you run a full BTC node you do.
As soon as you fire up a full node, you are becoming a service provider for paedophiles. This is not the case when you e.g. host a web site.
In addition, hosting and email services providers will delete your content and your account and inform the police if they find you were sharing CP through their servers. 
Miners will just mine on.
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:12:43
The presence of CP on the blockchain just means that it has been used (and maybe still is) as a medium of secure exchange of CP between paedophiles. 
Every full node and miner is therefore part of the infrastructure that gives paedophiles access to child pornography.
Make of that what you will.

Neither 35% nor 48% is a majority.
I also would not recommend making decisions of such a huge impact based on slim majorities.
What if some unionists decide they want to make a referendum to secede from Catalonia?
Would Catalonia let a border village go if it voted 51% for leaving Catalonia?
They are opening Pandora's box here.
Most countries have a higher majority requirement for constitutional changes. For a good reason.
Changes of such impact should not be made on a whim. 
As you have written yourself, the support for independence has fluctuated (wildly) over time (never reaching more than 49%). 
Why anyone would base the a far reaching decision, like seceding, on short term public opinion is beyond me.
@_date: 2017-10-28 11:57:30
If the police closed anything close to half of the voting places, that would mean the turnout was somewhere close 84%, which is clearly nonsense.
42% turnout is higher than in the previously held referendum, which was not hindered by police.
It is highly unlikely that the turnout would have been significantly higher without police interference.
@_date: 2017-10-28 11:47:15
The referendum a few years ago was done without any interference by the police. It had a lower participation and a lower approval rate.
The even less formal referenda held in several dozen communities over the course of a few years also had very low participation (around 20%-25%).
It appears the show of force of the government brought more people to the ballots and made them more determined.
Still, it is highly unsure that the separatists would have a majority at a properly held referendum that would not be boycotted by those opposed to a secession.
