"that's it" is what someone already entirely familiar with bitcoin would say. To say it's not an interesting concept to most people is simply wrong.

I'd like to point out that he still absolutely could be *the* satoshi. Think about it, everything he has said and done is exactly the smartest move for someone who was afraid of people attempting to link him to his online persona.
Then again, that could just be because he's legitimately not the guy. 
My point is that, if planned for and done properly, the anonymous architecture of Tor, Bitcoin and the internet at large would allow for *anybody* to hide in plain sight. After the internet trail is taken care of all you have to do is deny, deny, deny and nobody will be able to prove otherwise.

You have a fair point, but i'm still caught up on not being able to see how that makes it deserve the fate which the mods there gave it. Automatically culling certain articles based on a word search is possibly the worst, and easily the laziest, form of moderation you can have. 
In my opinion no valid tech topic could be abhorrent enough to be worthy of censorship like that. What is harmed by leaving it to the users to judge what they want to see? I have a hard time believing that the bot does anything to improve the content of the sub, and instead just arbitrarily limits the scope of that content based on the whim of a moderator.

To expand on 'Fuck Zynga'-- we hate them because they create games for the sole purpose of monetization. The gameplay itself is always based around that idea that no matter how much money you pour in, the game will always ask for more. Not paying essentially turns the game into a chore, and you will constantly be reminded of how much of a freeloader you are for not wanting to pay for a "free" game you just started playing. To top it off, they already make money off of you from the start by selling your personal information.
They aren't designing games, they are designing slot machines. Games are supposed to be heading in an artistic direction, and Zynga does exactly not that.

I don't think so. It would prove to people that perhaps the people trashing bitcoin on the news might not actually know what they're talking about.

How is that any different than Oculus Rift? That's as niche as you can get and a lot of people dislike the idea of VR, but it's talked about constantly on And yeah, the community does have those people but I don't think they have much to do with news articles regarding bitcoin.
You're not wrong, but I don't see that as a legitimate reason to shut down absolutely all discussion of the topic. Really, doing that for any topic on a place like reddit where the users decide the content is kind of a heavy handed thing to do.

My comment is not up on the front page of a major news outlet. All I have up for stake is some stupid karma number; she has stake in the integrity of an entire company. What I took from her article, exactly what I commented, is nothing but light commentary. The reporter however was playing with the poor guy's life, and refused to pay attention to all the signs pointing to the negative, instead following her own hunch as hard as a reporter possibly could. That's not journalism, its hard headed gossip.
@_date: 2014-04-14 14:21:09
Bitcoin is huge news in technology, what are you talking about? Listen to absolutely any tech cast or read any tech blog and bitcoin will come up at least occasionally. It's an absolutely interesting topic in technology, banning it outright is ridiculous.

I think he's referring to one of the speculations recently that karpeles is under a gag order (suspicion was caused after he gave a very out of place link to 9gag when asked about a serious topic), and some state agency is heavily involved in what is going on. It would explain why everything is so crazy and why karpeles is so much dumber than usual, but there's no easy way to prove something like that.

I'm not sure where all the bitcoin hate came from here. 
4 years ago bitcoin was the hottest topic in tech. Simply because that initial enthusiasm has died down does not change the fact that it's still a very relevant topic to technology.
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:31:46
So let me get this straight. A newsweek reporter assumes this guy is Satoshi, starts up an email conversation with him, when she asks about bitcoin he likely says "what the hell is that", after which she decides that response is just him trying to hide his true identity... and he stops replying. 
She then decides to show up to the guys house, where he promptly calls the police because what the hell why is this crazy lady ~~stalking~~ interviewing me. He says nothing of note, except that he is not involved with Bitcoin. Not giving up, she decides to interview a family member where the only thing of note said is "My brother is an asshole." After some more ~~harassment~~ research, she decides that the only evidence she needs to finger this guy as The Satoshi, is when he explicitly denied being him or having any involvement at all.
With her reporter's pad in hand, she gets back to Newsweek HQ, walks into her bosses office and how does she describe the entire thing?
"I've unmasked the man behind Bitcoin! This is a front page story!"

It'd be a good proposal if they weren't just trying to peddle their own shitty name idea. Maybe not get rid of the term bitcoin, but start a parallel service using the platform under a different name so that those who have unreasonable bias against btc might reconsider. When people think of Bitcoin, they think of lawsuits, drugs, and wild market fluctuations, once those issues are gone i think a new name is a good idea.
@_date: 2014-04-14 14:42:39
The only place I go specifically for bitcoin news is literally But I do keep up with technology and I'm always hearing about it, specifically on This Week in Tech as well as blogs like Ars Technica.
I mean really, it's a genuinely interesting topic, and not just to those involved with bitcoin. It has all the classic aspects of good tech topics: setting precedence for technology in the law, security and cryptography, the struggle of new tech vs an establishment not interested in change. How exactly does it not have something to do with technology? 
I find it ridiculous that they would ban something for the reason of, effectively, it becoming too popular a topic. I don't want to claim that bitcoin is facing mass adoption, but lets say that is the case in the near future (at the very least, of seriously facing that exact prospect). Why would you want to limit the discussion of a topic with such wide effect? I feel like they're doing it simply because the mods themselves are no longer interested in hearing about it, not because that's what their users think. Even if that's not the case, the fact that they are using blanket bans on whole topics in the first place severely harms their credibility in my opinion.

To be fair, you're not going to find any decent support from companies who outsource their support, like Microsoft. They teach their reps how to recover passwords and navigate menus over the phone-- things that Google teaches via, imo, the best Support/FAQ/Troubleshooting pages in the industry. 
Nearly all of the time, any *actual* problem on most support calls, in the end it would need to be escalated to a higher tier rep for anything to be done anyways. Which would end up taking about as long as Google does to respond to support emails.

Imagine if we had a chance to hear Trump's private thoughts/communications regarding Bitcoin. Do these people really think he'd be any less naive?
This is what delegation is for. You can't expect a candidate to know everything-- at least Clinton is smart enough to realize that and defers to the appropriate people.
I'd expect Trump, who seems to know everything, to handle the issue himself after a quick 30 second Google session. Remember, he's on the "war on drugs" side-- do you really think he's going to support what republicans see as the money people use to buy drugs?

They are buying more servers which will allow them to process more traffic. The issue is that, considering a DDoS strong enough, the attack will still be effective in the future. The only reason sites like Cloudflare, Amazon, and Google don't have DDoS problems is because they literally have entire datacenters full of servers.
For a single site like Mt Gox, DDoS's are going to be a persistent threat. A possible solution would be to use Amazon or another huge host to host the site who might be able to simply absorb a large DDoS, but I don't know if that is logistically possible.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:10:17
That's not a realistic view. There is no "necessary hardware" that allows you to sustain these attacks. I'm sure they used everything at their disposable to mitigate the attacks, but that combined with the huge traffic from legitimate customers as well most likely made the situation unmanageable for even the most experienced system administrators.
@_date: 2013-10-03 01:31:27
It's a modification of the image used on [another site awhile back]( The thing that makes me suspicious is that the state code section number is the same, even though they were taken down for different reasons. Also, "Silk Road" is still in the title, I don't remember that being there for other sites like Full Tilt Poker when it was seized.
Either our pal was smart enough to have an emergency killswitch (like if he didn't log in after a certain amount of time) which threw this up while the site gets nuked, or the FBI graphics guy is lazy.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:58:01
Yeah, but the point is that you will instead realize that the site is down rather than see a worthless market price.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:02:42
It would still need access to the internet to be able to determine the market price, right? If their entire network is congested due to the attack I think it would cause problems regardless.
@_date: 2013-04-30 23:44:11
Yeah, but in practice if you go to a cop and say that a drug dealer stole your money, they're going to laugh at you and walk away.

I agree completely. Some people might not like the fact that it would be out of the control of Mt Gox though. Then again, after what's happened over the past week maybe people would view that as a good thing.
@_date: 2013-04-26 05:52:31
There's nothing wrong with regulations that are put in place to protect the system itself. A good example of that are reddit's rules, which are the bare minimum required to keep the site operating without issue.

They probably already do have locations at multiple datacenters, but all that means is the attack traffic gets split between them.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:07:42
Even if it wasn't being maliciously DDoS'd, for all intents and purposes the hoards of investors trying to sell certainly caused the same effects as one.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:41:01
An issue with that though is that it takes the servers out of their hands. For something as sensitive as bitcoin trading I think it would be important they have full and exclusive control of the server rather than being on a virtual server platform where you're reliant on the host's security team rather than your own.
There have been cases where [entire datacenters have been hacked]( (fun fact: this host is my old employer)
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:43:49
Like I mentioned in another reply, they have multiple datacenters entirely full of servers. That gives them enough processing power to simply absorb the attack and continue functioning normally. Adding a few servers like Mt Gox is doing will help, but unless you have resources like Google has there there is always the lingering threat that a large enough DDoS will effect the performance of your servers.
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:05:37
Are you kidding me? This app needs to be uninstalled and the developer needs to be laughed out of the business. That is absolutely unacceptable.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:10:34
DDoS's aren't something that can just be fixed by installing more servers, especially if its being done by an abnormally large botnet. It requires a lot of work to mitigate but even then if the attackers are attentive enough Mt.Gox's protection efforts could be futile.
edit: I used to work at a hosting company with System Admins who's main job was to mitigate DDoS's. Things they would try involved blocking IPs, which is not effective if the attack is distributed. They'd also change the IP of the server, which only worked until the attackers realized that it has changed. Or they would intentionally take the server down until the situation cooled off which isn't an option for Mt Gox. If none of that worked, you're basically at the will of the attacker. There isn't some "magic box" you can install that will automatically block any DoS attack. It just doesn't work that way.
