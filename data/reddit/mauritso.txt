In the case of PoW yes. But there are alternatives (PoS, DPoS).

Because there is no way of knowing if a certain address exists if there are no previous transactions from/to that address. If the address is used before it can be found in the blockchain, if it isn't there is no practical way to be sure.

Counterparty depends on the bitcoin blockchain. If you change something in counterparty it will take 14-45 minutes per block (2 bitcoin blocks/confirmations I think) 
Bitshares has 10 second block times and thus changes/transactions are confirmed faster.
It doesn't necessarily make it better, counterparty and bitshares both have their respective uses, but that is an advantage bitshares has over counterparty.

I have looked around on the original Silk Road and I have a friend that bought stuff there. There is a review system, so you can easily see who is trustworthy and who isn't, if you buy from a reputable vendor chances are pretty high that you get what you paid for (there is still a chance of thing going wrong after shipment).

Or buy 0.01 cent BTS on an exchange ofcourse. And it wasn't really begging, post here and someone else will register your name for you. Not saying it was user-friendly or anything.

The invictus and some other devs are working on Bitshares Vote which is a DAC that has this purpose I believe.

In my experience Coinbase on humblebundle.com doesn't wait for confirms. The (~10 or so) transactions I did so far had near instant (maybe a few seconds) Coinbase "confirmation" times. That is using a blockchain.info webwallet.

You can't get USD into Bitshares X, you first have to buy BTSX (Bitshares) trough a centralised exchange/in-person exchange, or you could buy BTC first and then exchange that for BTSX (because the infrastructure of buying BTC with fiat is already in place). Then you can buy or go short BitUSD or BitBTC with your BTSX (for the first chain only these 2 will be "available", more IOU's will be added).
@_date: 2014-03-08 11:21:18
Bitshares might be a solution for this, it can be used as a decentralized exchange and the first version will be released in the next few weeks.
@_date: 2014-08-02 23:28:38
Bitshares X isn't unsuccesful looking at the market cap though, or doesn't that count as a 2.0?

When using linux you are probably 
used to not having binaries for every program. 
Luckily the code is available here: 
Ubuntu build instructions: 
Replace bitshares_toolkit with bitsharesx and it should work.
PM me if you can't get it to work.
I think it's still in alpha, but it's useable and you can try out some of the features (main feature, bitAssets should be added somewhere this month if all goes well)

He didn't get anything other than the games listed on: 
The money goes to the indie developpers, charity or humblebundle.com. 
Like this:
So it's mostly a donation and not so much for the games itself (but for the devs, charity or humblebundle).

Humble Bundle is a site where a "bundle" of games are offered, you can buy them for the price you want (Above $0.01 (all bundles) or $1.00 (steam/origin key bundles)). The top contributor list consists of the people who set the price the highest. In this case Bitcoin Armory set the price at $1,596.00 for 1 "humble bundle" (consisting of these games:

Sorry, I was thinking you meant prosecuting bitstamp (like mtgox), didn't realise it would be way more logical to be talking about the people that stole the bitcoins, my bad.
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:55:36
You said "he inherently admits that they indeed lost at least some of their coins", that is not the case. "This implies (not proves of course) that this may not be the case for the rest of the coins." That is the case. It just doesn't imply that anything is stolen. It may not be the case that the hot wallet coins are safe, but that is all it is right now.
EDIT: With right now I meant from the information of this tweet. It seems like (a part of) their hot wallet is compromised.
@_date: 2015-01-06 02:02:52
1) Can't guarantee safety, but a lot of people have worked on it and there were people actively trying to break the test networks (and probably the current network) to collect the bounty/bounties.
2) It's already working. A lot of test networks have been run before this and it is now on a real network for some time now.

Doesn't matter if the funds are not on/at that address anymore, does it?

Is there need for a criminal trial if Bitstamp covers the losses?

There should be 50+ price feeds from x different exchanges (there aren't that many so you could call it centralised) of which the median is used. This is a compromise to allow the bitshares market pegged assets to work at relatively low volumes. 101 delegates can all determine for themselves what the best price for their price feed would be (the calculation/sources is up to them), but they depend on the shareholders to stay a delegate. That is why it is in their best interest to publish how they do things and change it if the shareholders don't agree with it.
I wouldn't call that "as centralised as the others".

DPoS is a (form of) PoS.
The sun isn't star and an automobile isn't car.
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:21:41
Not necessarily, it is not built on the same code and it has some core differences from PoS making the statement not true in all cases 


@_date: 2015-02-24 09:58:27
It's not PoS its DPoS 
Shareholders can vote with their stake on delegates (people processing blocks) and the 101 people with the most votes will be the delegates. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 10:04:32
True, but so far it's holding up nicely with some knowledegable people actively trying to break it.
As we've seen the peg is there at low volumes and it will become more stable at higher volumes.
There are some mechanisms in place to stop trading when things get out of control. Currently the delegates (101 nodes actually running the network) will give a price feed ensuring that it will hold the peg at low volumes (in theory this shouldn't be necessary at higher volumes).
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:40:54
It is indeed a variation of the PoS protocol with certain advantages. But I wouldn't say that DPoS is PoS.
Just wanted to make that distinction, and saying that anything with PoS in the name is automatically not decentralised is a bit hasty.

There are techniques to get info out of the RAM, but the thing you linked isn't going to help with that.

I think that if you are going to hold on to it for a while it doesn't really matter that much if you buy at $800 or $1200. Bitcoin is either going to be really big or it's going to be worthless (for some reason). Invest what you are prepared to lose.

I agree that most altcoins don't offer much over bitcoin (mainly because of bitcoin adoption). But there are some other blockchain/bitcoind based projects that are interesting. Not as a bitcoin alternative, but as a seperate thing, for example a decentralized youtube alternative. Look around on this forum  bitshares/protoshares/wetube.
