I also think that people who adopted BTC early are much more likely to see that candidate, and be able to shift early, while those who are just investing because Bitcoin sounds safe will be left behind.

Haha wholesome bitcoin owners the lot of us. 
What makes you think we are early adopters? I'm inclined to agree and I'd be interested to know your reasons why!

Every major transaction I have done has been at the peak price point for that 24 hour window.

I wonder, and I really don't have a background in finance to inform this opinion, if Bitcoin entering the mainstream might mean it is more likely to be subject to currency manipulation on a large scale. Its profitability has been proven and it has a huge market cap, but I wonder if 'the masses' adopting it will make it a target for huge price shorts etc. in a way that is not incentivised by the status of bitcoin as niche...

Hahaha that was great

Sometimes that short term payoff is worth it though!

Wow what a great perspective. I wonder though, it seems like even the moderately wealthy/large investment firms are still yet to embrace Bitcoin. Seems 1929 is a bit far off still... Yet who knows!
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:54:49
Absolutely. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:07:58
Absolutely - do you always max out how much you purchase?

Although to be clear the trend of governments appears to be more, not less, manipulation of the money. Haha I don't think I've heard of a single, mainstream proposal by any government to decentralise currency. I have absolutely heard of negative interest rates on savings, capital controls, bank taxes and the like. Do you agree??

If you could recommend one book on how the economy works, which would it be??
I had no idea what quantitative easing was until I just googled it. I want to understand these things! I am a medical student, have never taken any economics/finance classes, but I really think this is such important knowledge as it quite literally impacts our day to day lives.

I guess this is the million (billion) dollar question - do you ever think bitcoin could just one day be actually worth nothing?
I guess some scenarios where that could happen include:
A) One cryptocurrency just really totally displaced it 
B) Somehow governments manage to regulate the purchase and sale of the currency to such an extent that it becomes far less worth it for the average consumer
C) Some kind of apocalypse where society collapses and both digital and paper currency become worth nothing.

I think the premise of that is that holding an asset is always the more rational choice, which I disagree with. It's quite possible that panic selling is a necessary inconvenience because one doesn't have the time to wait out a rise, particularly if you're a retiree who isn't earning active income. Likewise, if the stock suddenly lost value because it is defunct, outlawed or otherwise, then selling while some people are presumably still buying might make something out of the very likely nothing. 
I do agree that bitcoin, at least from my personal perspective, is of immense value and a foundation of next generation commerce/tech though, so holding is the rational thing to do.
