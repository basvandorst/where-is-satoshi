So not understanding If the rise in value is dollar for dollar.... or if it’s a percentage is a math question? ��

Please look at the rest of the thread. 
Simple math involves many other increases, not just a percentage increase. 
If you don’t know anything about the subject (bitcoin currency increase), then you don’t understand it period.
Would you be able to tell me why amyloid plaques occur as a part of the pathology in Alzheimers patients without googling it, or someone explaining it to you?
 Because your logic states that if it’s a simple part of a subject you should understand it.... right? 
Well that’s a very simple subject in current Alzheimer’s study. 
So please let me tell you it’s very simple, and you should understand that..without ever being around it. LOL

Thank you Dreamland. I appreciate your explanation! 
I’m very new to this. First time I’ve ever invested in something!

I appreciate this. Thank you. I’m glad there are humans like you who realize that everyone specializes in something different.
If you’ve never been around anything like it in your life, there are many ways to interpret how the subject works when you’re learning it yourself for the first time.
Thank you.

Oh my. I appreciate your attempt to explain. To be honest you are more frustrating, and antagonizing than you are helpful. In which I say was what you were attempting to be in the first place. Before I get into this let’s be honest... the whole apple and banana thing is quite humorous, but your attempt to drag it that low.... out of context even.... while knowing that isn’t a part of this discussion is quite cringe worthy.... now
I will also state that this pathology is not a fairly recent discovery, nor can you categorize it as a “specific.” Yet again in your logic you are stating that exchange and value mathematics is a general category. I’m pretty sure that math is a general category. Just as human health is a general subject. Just as Alzheimer’s can be a sub category to human health. Making value and exchange mathematics a sub category. Wouldn’t that make those two subjects the same... and you wrong? 
So even with your logic and rebuttals, layman’s terms and such.... it’s not possible that you can still think it’s correct to assume that someone knows something just because yourself claims it as “simple.” Obviously something I think is simple can be blinding to you until it is explained. 
So I feel confident in stating that your attempt at trying to reassure your self worth through a reddit bitcoin post was very petty, and quite embarrassing. Maybe you should think, and take into account that you might just be as ignorant to a subject that I am very familiar with. Instead of trying to belittle, be helpful and useful. Not petty and belittling.

I am a pre med student who has been a nurse for a year and a half. I can perform dosage calculus, algebra etc... how do you simply miss the point of....I’m new to this, and didn’t understand if the value matches dollar for dollar.... or if it’s a percentage raise? Lmao. I don’t even think a school system plays part in you not being able to comprehend that. That’s just a lack of intelligence/common sense at its core?
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:38:46
This doesn’t concern simple math, this concerns on how an increase works, if it is a percentage or dollar amount. 
So on your journey to be condescending. A simple question you simply couldn’t understand, actually made you look very.....very dumb. Enjoy lol.
