We ( offer a nice solution for merchants in the UK or Europe. Conversion of BTC to EUR and GBP as standard, we handle the IPNs and conversions, what shopping platform do you use?

Good questions!
1. The idea behind limiting large transactions can be because of both Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Launding (AML) legislation. It is most likely it is a feature enforced upon them by their legal team. We currently do not have this restriction, within reason. If your going to do (or may happen to have) some large transactions just let us know. We'd most likely already have chat to make sure we can provide exactly what you need anyway, and that we are the best partner for you. Our goal is know each customer well, not many customers hardly at all.
2. We have some great features planned for non-profit Organisations, specifically about tracking donation campaigns, feel free to reach out personally and I can let you know if we can help. james.carter
Thanks for reaching out.

Thanks, of course we would love to be transparent and tell you more.
I'd be happy to answer any specific questions you've got personally: james.carter

Hi! You can sign up for a trial to see how the portal works, or you can click our Donate and Experience button on the home page to test the payment page. £1.10 @_date: 2015-01-29 19:35:28
Thanks! That is a great idea and something we could definitely do. The beauty about just pricing your product in dollars or pounds is that we can do that conversion for you at checkout time. We also convert the funds into dollars or pounds automatically for you if you need.
@_date: 2015-01-22 13:33:34
Thanks, I'll try again.

Thanks for the feedback, I'll take a look at WP-Invoice and see what we ChainPay can do there.
@_date: 2015-01-29 19:36:18
Sounds great if you just need Bitcoin withdrawal. For the mean time when people need to repurchase stock they need that money back in fiat at a secure rate.
That is what companies such as ChainPay, Bitpay and Coinbase all provide. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:50:13
BitPay is much less attractive to European customers because of their high withdrawal limits for currencies such as Sterling and the Euro. Their transmissions fees for this are also higher than we can achieve with a European bank. Also, BitPay is not charging zero fees for their enterprise level clients, their zero fee model at the base is simply to drive merchant numbers.
@_date: 2015-01-30 09:41:59
Good question, that is the Organisation (Test Company Ltd's) private key for validating messages sent from ChainPay to your Wordpress installation. It is nothing to do with Bitcoin, simply to verify that it is not a malicious request being posted to Wordpress pretending to be ChainPay. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 23:17:20
Hi, yes we do! That is are the core of our value proposition. We all want Bitcoins expansion and adoption, that means merchants need concrete assurances they will not loose money on transactions.  
As a merchant, your in the goods and services business, rather than the fx market. We belive that by securing an invoice value merchants can have confidence in Blockchain backed payments, as such the future is unwritten, once we get widespread support more merchants will keep Bitcoin as Bitcoin. Once they can use it in turn in a B2B scenario we should see less and less the need for this. 
Sorry for the long post, short answer. You are guaranteed the invoice value, minus our 1% charge. We take any losses from our 1% and buffered reserves.
@_date: 2015-01-21 23:27:55
We've only just launched, we are currently taking on merchants and ensuring everything is running smoothly. We hope to have more exposure soon.
Thank you. I hadn't noticed the encoding was incorrect on the QR code and button. This is now resolved. 2 bugs Great idea about the BIP70 URI; we do have plans for a short-code for this. Currently very busy ensuring our merchants are getting what they need out of the system but this is definitely in our to-do list.

Thanks for the feedback! $2.5 @_date: 2015-01-23 17:18:08
For European merchants we can definitely offer a more personal service, including bespoke integration for merchants.
We also have lower withdrawal limits for European currencies such as Pounds Sterling and Euros due to our European banking relations.
If you have a specific requirement I'd be glad to hear about how we could help address it. Feel free to email me: james.carter
@_date: 2015-01-23 18:33:37
Hi, yes ideally we would like to offer any withdrawal amount for zero withdrawal fees. Similar to PayPal, unfortunately because the volume of transactions we are processing (unlike PayPals multimillions) means through the economies of scale we are unable to offer this.
I feel that £500 is not too bad for a merchant to wait on, we definitely wanted it under the £1000 mark. As soon as our volume increases to allow us to negotiate with our banking partners we will lower this as far as we can.
If you have a particular idea for implementation we could discuss how we could help you?
Thanks for the question!
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:51:05
Thanks so much for the comments, if you notice any API documentation issues we'd be glad to clear those up, as the docs are quite new.
If you have any problems or queries just send me and email and I will personally respond: james.carter
@_date: 2015-01-23 17:00:17
I think its because we are more technical people than creative! Maybe some more money spent on advertising instead of creating a great service would come up with something better with less vowels, more Web 2.0?
@_date: 2015-01-30 09:40:49
WP Invoice looks like a nice platform that we will investigate shortly.
Quickbooks is a bigger deal, we would have to see how we could partner to provide a better service than BitPay.
@_date: 2015-01-23 19:34:11
Thanks for the question. We are not from the Isle of Man, however when looking for the best place to locate ourselves, we found that the Isle of Man government is really on Bitcoin's side. They are readily available to answer any questions you have about legislation and the like. They also are very progressive, deeming the existing (extensive) legislation around money transfers are security enough, as long as they are followed. So in short, the Isle of Man is a great place to locate any crypto related business.
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:54:17
Hi, which one? AltXE or ChainPay?
@_date: 2015-01-21 13:30:50
Hi simmrdown,
  We have just launched a new payment gateway for Bitcoin. We are not as big as BitPay or Coinbase but we may be able to offer you a more personal service and help with integration.
  
  Let me know if I can answer any questions for you about accepting Bitcoin in general.
@_date: 2015-01-23 18:38:35
Thank you for the test! We have a few ideas on how we can improve the use of BIP70 to allow for subscriptions. Using the BIP70 allows us to improve our refund process which is a really nice feature for merchants that are unfamiliar with Bitcoin and expect things to work in a 'PayPal' like fashion.
We do need to improve the payment page for mobile, probably dropping the QR code unless requested (you can't scan your own screen, without a couple of mirrors!).
Thanks for the comments, all our donations go to a good cause.
£1 @_date: 2015-01-23 19:39:46
Thanks I will get in touch.
@_date: 2015-01-23 19:16:05
That is a good idea and something we've been thinking about, the issue with that is the processing of credit card transactions and the costs involved to provide insurances to the bank, and also the chargebacks!
If your just after 50% in Bitcoin, 50% in Cash from Bitcoin payments (Or any percentage split), this a feature we are enabling very very soon.
Of course there is no reason not to accept both, if you have an existing credit card provider you can simply add ChainPay as an additional payment option. I know I do less cart abandonment when I can pay with Bitcoin, simply because there isn't time to think, 'do I really need this widget?' or 'could I get this cheaper elseware?' as I pay so quick!
Thank you for the comments!
@_date: 2015-08-28 17:05:26
That's right, Bitcoin is an option you can choose whilst setting up your payment options.
@_date: 2015-07-02 19:00:57
Thank you very much, we shall reword as you advise!
@_date: 2015-07-02 16:01:21
We would appreciate feedback on our localisation of our payment page at chainpay.com. If you click the Donate button you will be presented with a Payment page in the localisation requested by your browser, falling back to English. Any improvements would be appreciated :)
@_date: 2015-07-02 19:01:58
Apologies, the direct link is here: 
Note we use Javascript on the payment page to determine payment status and update when your payment has been received :)
@_date: 2015-11-17 10:34:57
Yes we need to think how we can lock down the proof. Having a min balance is not feasible for many applications.
@_date: 2015-11-29 23:30:09
ChainPay would support adding this to the Payment Protocol. RBF changes a fundamental assumption about transaction propagation that makes a payment processors logic a little more wary about unconfirmed transactions.
Currently ChainPay guarantees the merchant the funds for a payment once it is confirmed by 3 blocks, but some merchants offering digital downloads and other non-physical goods do take zero-confs when the purchase is more reactive.
Zero fees are more easily handled, with the Payment Protocol the merchant is able to alter the transaction to add a fee before it is broadcast to the network, which we do if the value paid is larger than we would like to accept with no-fee, to force the transaction into the next block (push it into the High Priority section of the Block).
@_date: 2015-03-23 22:52:47
Please see my other comment which explains in further detail our reasoning. Thanks for your time.
@_date: 2015-11-16 22:02:42
I have thought of something similar for inclusion into ChainPay, whilst the proof of payment is valid, it does not stop people from sharing this proof of payment.
Lets take the example of a live sports show, you scan proof of payment and sign with your address, and the cable provider validates your signed nonce and provides your TV with the decryption keys for the show.
There is nothing to prevent the payer from sharing his/her private key and allowing other users to sign different nonces from the cable provider to allow many people to view the same show on the same payment.
Of course the cable service could refuse to issue more than say 5 decryption keys (in the case of moving from the TV to the laptop), but in other areas this may be an issue.
I think your proposal is great and in no way do I want to detract from it! We just need to think about how we could prevent the above attack.
Edit: I think the proposal would work well for cases where there would only be one valid use of the service, such as entry to a concert when the entry of that ticket can be recorded and transmitted to other entry stalls.
@_date: 2015-02-06 14:31:49
Yes, although BlockPay sounds like a more traditional form of money transfer...
@_date: 2015-03-23 14:58:32
Exactly that. Here we discuss how best to decide the probability that the push transaction will exist in perpetuity rather than it being lost due to a double spend, block chain reorganised etc, without going too far into the bitcoin internals.
@_date: 2015-02-06 14:30:45
These are also a good approach when you are keeping all the Bitcoin, and something we support entirely.
For merchants where this is untenable, we hope to offer a trusted party to perform the service of payment processing, exactly the same as when a customer pays a US store from their Euro credit card.
@_date: 2015-03-23 22:50:51
Thanks for your comments, your exactly right that we are choosing these confidence levels. Whilst the fraud rate over the entire network is very low, as it is in card payments, this does not apply to a transaction taken in isolation. You have no idea if a new transaction is made by a honest party or a potential fraudster.
All you can trust is that after a certain number of confirmations you have a high Confidence your isolated transaction will not be reversed.
From a merchants point of view they are not looking at the entire network, just their particular transactions.
Probability is not equal to confidence, as an example, the probability of you requiring to claim on your house insurance because of it collapsing is extremely low. But because this event would more than likely bankrupt most people, they are not confident they can do without it.
It's all about isolated confidence for a merchant. We are not trying to raise concerns about bitcoin transaction security as a whole, simply explaining in a basic way the process of how merchants can evaluate the risk in a method they already understand.
Thanks for your input!
@_date: 2015-02-06 14:35:03
We can indeed and will be happy to add this to the website.
Ideally users paying with ChainPay will get a better price for their coins than selling via an exchange because of the fee discount we get through our volume.
@_date: 2015-02-06 14:29:18
That's the idea - having launched with simple payment methods in a lean approach, we aim to iterate over the eCommerce space and add some really nice functionality to Bitcoin payments, hopefully extending BIP70.
@_date: 2015-02-04 16:07:48
According to BuiltWith.com, there are approximately 60,000 stores. In terms of maximizing awareness of this extension for any BigCommerce store in the world, we would really appreciate community support in getting the message out!

1 beer @_date: 2015-02-06 17:31:08
Exactly correct, you will see from our angel list entry we have received no VC money are entirely self funded. As opposed to simply adding as many merchants as possible at a loss to hit targets for the next funding round, we aim to cultivate mutually beneficial relationships.
@_date: 2015-02-06 22:03:15
Do you have a specific use case? We support business globally, but currently only remit in USD EUR GBP, despite this you can still raise an invoice for CAD but it will be held and sent in USD and converted by your bank. Contact me for a discussion on what we can do for you, james.carter
@_date: 2015-02-06 17:11:57
Most of the exposed services are C but thanks for the interest.
@_date: 2015-02-06 14:28:24
This is a feature we are looking to add so you can do a cost comparison across the various merchant processors from a consumers point of view.
We aim to be very lean in this approach, ideally users will get a better price by purchasing through ChainPay than by selling Bitcoins themselves, due to the greater volume discounts we can obtain.
We offer withdrawal in GBP, EUR, USD currencies, when Invoices are created for currencies other than your native currency, we use the rates from openexchangerates.org which is pretty much standard across the board.
@_date: 2015-02-06 17:13:03
Currently Bitstamp and Kraken, but we are always looking for more providers to increase redundancy.
