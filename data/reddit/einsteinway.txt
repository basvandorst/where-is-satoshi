Already planning!

You're now tagged as "the guy who charged me $8 for a soggy waffle".

Then it was a stupid point to make in the first place. 
"Oh a girl got raped? Well, morality aside, she should have expected it."
Thanks for making it crystal clear just how little we should value your stream of consciousness.

Nope, nope, and nope. "Just doin' my jerb" NEVER alleviates responsibility.

You have probably acted in ways to divert potential harm upon yourself.
Of course. I understand that explaining causality doesn't necessarily have anything to do with claiming moral justification. 
I'm simply explaining to you, as a function of communication, why this particular type of declaration is typically **seen** as victim blaming.

Except that's exactly how they get changed. But most people, like you, will spend their entire life licking boots and hoping that "the people" will eventually vote for a peppermint flavored boot.

At least you have enough sense to make the state analogous to a commune of convicted rapists.

You're missing the point. Saying "well if they didn't do [insert action that the victim did that everyone realizes increased their chance of harm but they had every right to do] then [insert bad thing that happened to them by the conscious decision of an aggressor]". 
It's irrelevant, at best (since you aren't introducing any new information), and sounds like victim blaming/perpetrator apologetics at worst. 
That's probably not your intention, but that's just how people will (understandably) process it. 
"If that kid who got murdered hadn't taken candy from a stranger, he'd have lived to see six."
See what I mean?
