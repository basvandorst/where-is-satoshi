Legalising insider trading is beneficial for the ordinary investor as the price at all times reflects the economic situation.
Making it illegal means the price and economic reality are now dissociated and ordinary investors are forced to base their decisions on this altered reality.

Happened to me a couple of times in last few weeks.
Coinbase has been under heavy load to lots of new users signing up in a short period of time.
Entering username/password again wont help in logging in, just give it some time - If you try opening the app in couple of hours, it will just work and automatically sign you in.

That theory needs empirical testing :)
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:13:49
Good point. Clearly there are convulating factors.
But there is also a very visible economic theme which remains largely unaffected.
@_date: 2018-08-12 11:20:46
Everything you said is correct but you have ignored a lot of important details. No one is disputing that it takes time to bring Rigs online.
Also, your circumstances may not apply to all miners, the Chinese have an absolute edge over most Western miners in terms of preferential access to ASICs.
However, The lower cost ones squeezing out the higher marginal cost miners is not just theory, it’s a real world fact based on laws of economics.
Remember the reward pie is fixed in size for atleast 4 years and gets smaller (price change is a confounding variable).
Moreover not all miners have a similar access (in terms of quantities) to ASICs.
The articles discusses this step by step for a reason.

It’s counterintuitive to assume Americans have same access to Bitmain hardware; Bitmain farms obviously have a superior access to hardware. 
Even if it’s not right now, it “ought to be”.
What follows from logic can’t be negated by ad hoc observations.
@_date: 2018-08-11 16:37:11
@_date: 2018-08-11 18:24:02
Yes the low marginal cost miners with ease of hardware access
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:07:49
The residential and industrial tariffs can be Googled.
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:34:28
Looks good, thank you.
@_date: 2018-08-11 18:19:18
And a few other constraints.
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:40:56
Yes but the marginal power cost is different for each. Also ease of access in large volumes is already different.
@_date: 2018-08-11 18:21:35
Miners usually have a broader long term view and don’t respond to prices instantaneously
Hash rate is determined *primarily* by price not the other way (that’s labour theory of value).
It is true that hashing power is determined by the current price as well the present discounted value of expected future (price).
@_date: 2018-08-12 11:23:21
And ease of access to large quantities of ASICS.
@_date: 2018-08-11 18:37:18
People are severely underestimating how much centralisation will a falling price will lead to.
@_date: 2018-08-12 16:45:38
Thank you for the information - as I suspected ;)
@_date: 2018-08-11 18:20:11
Yes - That’s covered in the article.
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:28:20
Most ASICS are Chinese. Litttle guys don’t have the scale.
Samsung manufacture chips for the Chinese
Also 3 is too low a number still; hopefully more ASIC manufacturers come up in next 24 months preferably US/European.
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:21:00
Details in the article.
Falling prices provide a tremendous advantage to relatively low marginal cost miners with relatively easy access to ASICs.
They can rapidly gain market share squeezing others out and centralising a lot of hashing power.
Falling price is their greatest friend.
This is not true when the prices are rising as the marginal advantage is partially nullified from rising prices.
All enjoy to varying degrees in rising prices. But higher marginal cost miners get burnt badly in falling prices.
Moreover, the gains are asymmetrical. When the lower marginal cost starts gaining market share, it’s marginal cost starts falling at the same time - a double advantage.
I suspect the Chinese know this - hash rate has tripled in last 8 months.

So miners will continue spending money on electricity regardless of Bitcoin price ? 
What if the marginal cost per bitcoin is $3000 and bitcoin price is $1000?
Marginal cost is not the same as “cost”
@_date: 2018-08-24 12:36:17
Good chart.
I wrote a post few weeks ago on the economics of bitcoin mining.
I suspect a lot of Chinese miners are in that 3 to 4c per unit price range.
@_date: 2018-08-11 18:44:13
The break even marginal cost can be calculated with publically available numbers with a conservative estimate. I have made a short comment under the Medium article responding to someone else.
The article discusses simple economics but most wont know without reading. Cheers 
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:11:29
It’s a high cost country so we can probably write it off for mining marginal advantage purposes.
In countries like China, there are a lot of side deals with tariffs as low as 4 cents per unit.
I suspect the  Chinese have a marginal break event at less than $1500 per bitcoin.
Also remember, as a marginally advantaged miner gains market share by expanding, its marginal cost starts going down.
There is serious economics at play here.
@_date: 2018-08-13 13:34:46
Haha, no worries. My bad as well :)
Cheers bud 
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:46:13
Botnets for Monero aren’t helping either ;)
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:01:52
Not when discussing “at the margin”.
Sunk costs is one thing for ROC calculations but whether to continue mining poses a simple question : Is the operation atleast covering the OPEX?
But you are right (for a seperate analysis) different CAPEX will affect outcomes.
There are some complications like miners running at a loss hoping for higher prices
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:32:30
My apologies
 I meant I agreed with what the commentor’s assessment and the article discusses it.
Can’t copy paste whole chunks here, sorry.
If you had spent 10 seconds looking at my responses, you would see I have given detailed comments where necessary 
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:27:17
I meant that the pricing in bits/satoshi might be a better idea - too many zeros when priced in Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-06-10 11:42:17
This is a just an extrapolation, no indication of what the actual hash rate will be.
Too many economic actors, incentives and uncertainties.
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:26:34
21M is the technical supply. Effectively, the supply is unlimited since there are other coins with equivalent functionality and similar "scarcity" and there exist freely fluctuating exchange rates between the various coins.
It's surprising that people don't understand this simple point. The marginal cost of switching to an alternative network (and/or back and forth) is almost zero due to freely fluctuating exchange rates.
@_date: 2018-03-22 06:27:25
Not in 2018
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:45:09
That is in the presence of “actually” scarce commodity monies.
There would be “some” distinguishing characteristics allowing monies to coexist.
The trend is, I agree for a few to dominate. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 06:17:16
Remember the “real supply” is not fixed as there are other coins. As Bitcoin becomes more and more expensive you can expect people to use Litecoin, Monero etc. for smaller transactions.
The actual supply is not 21 million, its unlimited - unlike physical commodity monies.
@_date: 2018-04-17 09:31:26
Yes, that looks about right. /s
@_date: 2018-04-28 06:02:51
You need to step back and ask yourself - Why would anyone spend their time helping you ?
Ask not what is in it for you but ask what is in it for us from whom you are asking for help.
Incentives matter, humans respond to incentives.
@_date: 2018-04-28 08:37:22
All good, words sometimes don’t convert the context :)
Thanks for your efforts !
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:44:14
Scam 
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:21:01
Fees reflect underlying economic reality.
@_date: 2018-04-28 08:08:14
Thank you for doing this for the community. All I am hinting at that you might need reword it to make others see the value- for them.
Sorry if it came across as a inconsiderate, that was not the intention at all. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:15:04
It does. That’s why the fee is 30% and not 5%.
Scarcity and ease of access.
@_date: 2018-04-30 10:05:00
Too many zeroes in the price.

Inflation is defined as an increase in money supply
