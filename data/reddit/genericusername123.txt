I'm sure a lot of business owners in the EU will be asking themselves the same question right about now.

As far as I know, nothing below 100k euro is touched (hence the un-blocked part), and everything above is frozen until they decide how much to take. Current estimates are around 40%, although someone in the thread that OP linked suggested 80%.
There are also controls to stop you taking the 100k part out of the bank, so I don't know what the difference is between 'can't take it out' and 'frozen'.

Yes, absolutely, including everyone's funds below 100k as well. This is why I find the calls of 'theft' and 'let the banks fail' a little uninformed. I tried to explain what is going on [here]( but I think people might prefer the 'theft' narrative.

Fine, suggest a different word then. Speculative value vs. utility value? Unless you are arguing against the concept itself?

Frozen would be a better term- until they decide how much to take. This particular bank is the worst hit by the bailout agreement, and up to 80% of deposits over 100k EUR will be converted to 'bank shares'- in a valueless bank.

The cynic in me says that he/she has already bought, and is now trying to raise the price by creating speculative demand, before selling it all before 30 mins is up.

That sounds about right, it does seem like a good idea to separate speculation on viability of something that may or may not work, and speculation on purely rising prices.

OK, since nobody has attempted to explain what is going on here, I'll give it a go.
Since Cyprus joined the EU, its banking sector has grown enormously, benefiting from what was a healthy economy in a strong monetary union. The sector rapidly grew out of proportion with the country's finances- in 2011, the total of all loans from Cypriot banks amounted to about 8 times the country's GDP.
With the global financial and greek crisis, these loans went bad, and the banks are now, well, bankrupt. Cyprus needs money from the EU to bail out the banks (and hence allow people to retrieve the money in their bank accounts), but the EU wants Cyprus to foot some of the bailout bill- 5.8 billion from Cyprus and 10 billion from the EU.
The original Cyprus-EU proposal for raising this 5.8 billion was to charge a one-off tax on all bank accounts, which was voted down by the government. Under the new agreement, amounts under 100k EUR are untouched, but amounts over 100k will be partially converted into bank shares in a soon-to-be-created bank. The exact amount of conversion is still up for debate, but for OP's bank, it looks like it might be up to 80%.
In the meantime, although amounts below 100k are theoretically untouched, they can't actually be withdrawn from a bank- the maximum you can take out is 300 EUR per day. Obviously, companies can't really operate under these conditions.

If the bailout didn't happen, OP would lose 100% of the 700k, as the bank he lent his money to went bankrupt. As it is, he will probably lose 80% of it, with the remaining 20% coming from the EU.
If OP got 100% of his money back, this would come directly out of the taxes of other EU countries. Is *that* theft?

They cease to be personal assets once you loan them to a bank in order to make money with them. There is usually an amount below which the government will guarantee to pay back if the bank goes bankrupt. Above that, you really are on your own from a legal standpoint- if the bank loses your money, it's lost. This is the case in all countries afaik, it's just rarely tested.

There is a huge difference between consumer goods (driven by the demand for the good itself) and speculative investments (driven by the belief that the thing you are buying will rise in value, so you can sell it later for a profit). You also can't really have a 'bubble' in an adoption rate- if you plotted the adoption rate of black &amp; white TV instead of color TV, you'd see the adoption rate drop sharply as color TV was introduced. Nobody would call black &amp; white TV a specultive bubble.
You have bubbles when a price is driven much higher than the intrinsic value of something based solely on the belief that the price will keep rising. The 'bursting' of the bubble is when the price starts to drop, causing some people to sell out to avoid losses, which results in the price dropping more, more people selling out, etc.. This continues until the price is back to intrinsic value.
To decide if bitcoin is a bubble, you have to decide if the price is reflective of the true value of bitcoin (i.e. people are buying it to use it), or if the price is driven by people using it as an investment to try to sell it for a profit later.
Honestly, I think it's a bit of both, with the speculative increase driving an increase of actual usage. But comparing the price rise of bitcoin to the adoption rate of a standard consumer good is not really useful.
EDIT: I should also add that comparing Bitcoin to tulip mania is also not really fair, since Bitcoins do have an inherent value which could be quite large, we just don't really know what it is yet. Tulip mania was purely speculative, since people knew the true value of a tulip (it looks pretty in the garden), yet they paid huge amounts of money in the belief that the prices would keep rising.

[BBC's]( summary of the situation.

Yes, that was the original proposal but it was voted down in parliament. The new deal isn't technically a tax (it's a 'restructuring') and so can't be voted down by parliament (if I understand things correctly).

I'm using 'intrinsic value' as the price you would be willing to pay to use something (a TV or a microwave), versus the 'speculative value' that comes with investments that have no use other than to make money. I find it difficult to believe that you cannot see the difference.
