I'm sure he will write many many blog posts that give you that illusion. It's a foolproof investment.
@_date: 2014-12-29 20:12:30
That's not normal!

I don't understand.
@_date: 2014-12-31 15:08:42
sciencehatesyou is a troll too. Trolls defending trolls.
@_date: 2014-12-29 19:23:23
That's not very helpful.
@_date: 2014-12-30 20:57:37
That's very interesting! I'm really glad I read this posting!
@_date: 2014-12-31 15:18:13
Yeah I played this and it never gave me the promised payouts.

Everyone's a joker!

FISHY! Hah, took me a moment.

Don't bother with Armory if you want to keep things easy.
If you're concerned with security on your daily driver laptop, then you could 
* get a Trezor or one of the other hardware wallets
* use a multisig wallet like Coinkite or Greenaddress
* use an android wallet, which is not perfect in terms of security but a lot better than the average laptop.

Ok, I read the article and still downvoted it, because the author is making a lot of bullshit arguments that are so obviously wrong that I don't even care to refute them. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 19:21:41
Good job coordinating the shills: About 80% of the comments in here at this time are from troll accounts. 
@_date: 2014-12-29 15:20:32
For some it's just really hard to believe that there could be sad people out there who literally spend 8 hours every day talking shit about bitcoin without someone paying them to do so.
@_date: 2014-12-29 16:58:04
You guys still pushing doge? It's almost 2015 you know.
@_date: 2014-12-31 14:13:10
Just send bitcoins to Vitalik's wallet, same thing.
@_date: 2014-12-31 14:10:56
If you used coinjoin it can take a while because there's not enough people using darkwallet.
@_date: 2014-12-31 12:31:19
And that's a real fucking achievement too around here!
@_date: 2014-12-31 17:59:33
Don't tell me what to do. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-12-31 23:30:21
You still have the same amount of bitcoins. Which might be worth more or less than you payed for it, depending on the current price.
@_date: 2014-12-30 21:25:23
You are now officially an idiot.
@_date: 2014-12-30 23:48:57
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you. I think I've read something about it on here a while ago that made it sound like a scam. But it might have been just another troll posting. It seems impossible to take any useful information from this sub these days. 
@_date: 2014-12-31 15:13:32
@_date: 2014-12-30 23:55:13
Because one year ago is when these people who now post on your wall have first heard about bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-31 17:45:30
Geoffrey who?
@_date: 2014-12-31 17:58:51
It was a pun on his name dude.
And it does matter if it's just nobody  repeating the same old misconceptions, or if it's someone who has some kind of reputation on the line.
@_date: 2014-12-31 12:36:26
@_date: 2014-12-30 23:20:04
I heard it's a scam.
@_date: 2014-12-30 20:47:33
I'm not sure how many of the trolls can answer this one.
@_date: 2015-01-16 14:01:19
Judging from all the downvotes, people here are stupid as fuck. 
Guise! Guise!! He is not a hacker, he is just describing his cold storage setup and is looking for potential weak points! 
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:51:25
You mean you would happily give her another pearl necklace? ;)
Just kidding of course. Love your videos TinaHui, even though the edited ones had a lot more energy than the newer ad hoc style videos which feel a little bit bland in comparison.
@_date: 2015-01-02 10:09:22
Well, I hope you find someone who doesn't mind handing $10 to a completely anonymous stranger on the internet just because. But I doubt that you will.
$10 might not be a lot of money. But the feeling of getting scammed for whatever amount of money is just not a good feeling, so why would anyone risk that? Nobody likes feeling stupid.
@_date: 2015-01-15 18:33:03
This person is part of a raid / brigade from Mods, please ban him. Thanks.

This is why we can't have nice things.

Then he wins Satoshi's coins!
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:50:33
Read the thread. OP is using a Trezor.
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:42:21
He's not defending the scam, he's defending the position taken by the organizers of the Miami Bitcoin Conference. It's an important distinction that many of you seem to be unable to make.
@_date: 2015-01-02 10:18:59


I'm neither of those things. I'm just being honest with you.
If I want to help someone out, I will do so in a situation that is transparent to me. And there is absolutely no lack of such opportunities. Supply and demand I guess.
@_date: 2015-01-02 09:44:19


Connected to what? To using bitcoin? To being $10 short for something?
If you don't want anyone to see where the bitcoins are going for whatever reason, then just send them through a mixer first. You should know how to do that after being involved with bitcoin for years.
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:50:45
The easiest way is to install Electrum on your PC, upload and import your Bitcoin Core wallet.dat to blockchain.info, then immediately send your bitcoins to an address in your local Electrum wallet.
But this is not what "cold storage" means. Cold storage means storing your bitcoins on a device or medium that is never connected to the internet.
@_date: 2015-01-02 10:25:57
At no point have I attacked you, insulted you or accused you of anything. The only one here throwing insults around like confetti at a carnival is you.
And no, there is no transparancy here. The only thing that has become very transparent to me is that I'm glad that I didn't give someone like you $10.
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:55:08
It's actually the perfect name!
@_date: 2015-01-02 10:46:52
Oh god. Man am I glad now that I didn't give you any money.
@_date: 2015-01-16 14:10:00


No thanks, we can read the article too.


Did YOU read the article?? It says right there:


So either you're the "attacker", or you're full of shit.
@_date: 2015-01-02 11:00:54
Yes, you're definitely not the only idiot around here. There's a whole lot of you. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 10:38:30
You are begging. It's not an insult in any sense, it's just what you're doing here. If you don't want to call it begging for money, then call it begging for trust or begging for the kindness to help someone out. Whatever. You are asking someone to give you $10, risking to lose it and feeling like a complete tool for getting scammend, and you offer absolutely nothing in return. 
Had you posted this from an account that has at least a mininum of reputation to lose, then this would be a completely different and less one-sided scenario. And this was the point of all my replies to you in this thread. I never attacked or insulted you, while you constantly attacked and insulted me.
Sorry that me telling you how it is has offended YOU.
@_date: 2015-01-02 12:59:06
True. And I think the correct R value for the above transaction would actually be
    0084e884dc0ce63c7e3b634a276ce3326193aa961d6da9497bbc3f69fb88181b80
But I could be wrong :)
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:59:39
I like your service because you make it easy to get rid of altcoins and receive bitcoins instead. But I hope I will never see one of your shifty buttons anywhere: It adds absolutely nothing over just using Bitcoin, except another useless layer of complexity, confusion and fees. No thanks.
@_date: 2015-01-02 11:54:04
Makes sense.
@_date: 2015-01-02 14:29:56
Good video. Thank you, Phil Hellmuth.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:44:20
And idiots "invest" in each and every one of them no matter how stupid and pointless they are. I'm pretty sure some of them would even put their money in Roomcoin if you gave them the opportunity.
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:28:23
Shapeshift is not really an exchange. But it's a pretty handy service to quickly get rid of all the useless doges one might get tipped on reddit.
@_date: 2015-01-02 14:03:56
Maybe OP meant to use effect here and used it correctly and you're just making assumptions about the meaning of OP's posting?
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:58:04
Remember that when you import your private keys in Electrum, they will not be part of the 12 words backup! That's why I prefer sending the bitcoins to an address generated in Electrum. That way everything is covered by the deterministic backup.
@_date: 2015-01-02 10:02:10


Privacy comes at a price I guess. This time that price was $10.
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:19:07
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:10:51
Don't even care to read the questions there as it's mostly just a stupid pointless troll fest. Waste of time for everyone, especially for Andreas.
@_date: 2015-01-02 13:27:34
Where can I invest in this Roomcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-02 11:47:37
Why? Do you have a way of checking this?
@_date: 2015-01-02 12:45:48
Look at the spent outputs from OP's address, the R values are part of the input script. Like [here](


@_date: 2015-01-02 09:54:50


The only information that can pile up from this is that you use bitcoin and you needed $10 to buy something. Apparently that is a problem for you. It's okay, no need to explain yourself. But it also means you're probably not getting your $10.
@_date: 2015-01-02 08:54:08


I think people are more willing to pay for fetish porn which is hard to find otherwise. I know I am.
@_date: 2015-01-16 10:41:35
Bitcoin price = x * y / z
I will now tell you what the bitcoin price should be by filling in arbitrary numbers for x, y and z.
@_date: 2015-01-02 09:48:57
Alright, so you don't want your real name to be connected to using bitcoin. That's the only thing I can take away from this. Good luck with your begging.
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:59:11
I'm not sure if Bitcoin is ready for that yet. But there's some supermarket in the Netherlands that accepts bitcoins:
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:50:36
I'm running out of Popcorn here. Sometimes I'm just glad that I'm not one of these greedy idiots who fall for scams like that.
@_date: 2015-01-02 12:32:37
I don't even see anything on tinypic because that site sucks so much that one of my addons prevents it from actually displaying pictures and I can't be bothered to fix it for such a stupid site, but is it the Dollar you're talking about? Because if it is, then you're not the first one to notice.
@_date: 2015-01-16 13:53:26
No thanks, we can read the article too.
@_date: 2015-01-02 14:25:44
Hmm. It might explain why they are the most popular wallet despite having a bad track record. Or people are really just kind of lazy when it comes to things like that and they take the first/easiest option that gets presented to them.
@_date: 2015-01-02 10:56:31
It probably didn't have enough exposure yet to come on the radar of these companies. I mean, most bitcoin users haven't heard of paybase or paycoin, let alone anyone outside of this still very small "scene".
@_date: 2015-01-02 11:28:27
The usual suspects here are:
* You logged in to a phishing site.
* You logged in to the clearnet site of BCI via TOR and got man-in-the-middled by a malicious exit node.
* Someone stole a backup of your wallet and it was either encrypted with a weak password or they also stole your password.
* This is another case of a weak k value caused by a bad implementation of the random function by BCI.
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:07:02
That was pretty scary.
@_date: 2015-01-02 11:39:53
Try contacting their support desk: 
Or maybe can shed some light on this.
@_date: 2015-01-02 14:20:31
Sure, might be true to some extent. But what is this supposed to explain again?
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:17:56
That's not a very realistic scenario. Just because all the trolls keep repeating stuff like that doesn't mean it's true. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:48:56
Creating a new address for every transaction prevents accidents like this one. There really is no good reason to use the same address more than once.
@_date: 2015-01-02 11:18:28


No it's not. It's not even a concern. It's not even like rain on your wedding day. It's just stupid troll dung. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 11:37:03
That would leave the last scenario of weak k value / reused R value as the most likely culprit. If that is the case then we'll probably soon hear from other people who also had their coins stolen from BCI :(
@_date: 2015-01-02 21:10:05
Why would they care?
@_date: 2015-01-02 11:05:45
I didn't even buy a ticket and I still want my money back! That's how outraged I am about this!
@_date: 2015-01-02 09:36:18
Why the hell would you post this from a 0 day account? Nobody is going to give $10 to a begging throwaway.
