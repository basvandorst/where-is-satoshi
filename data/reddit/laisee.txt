Can you name one single sidechain you would be willing to put all your into now? in one year? two years? Not one I would guess.
@_date: 2015-12-23 02:32:06
Not wrong in pointing out this change benefits LN far more than the average Bitcoin user. As for the use case of malleability affecting use of change transactions ... exactly how many transactions have ever caused this scenario? Not many. Seems more like another edge case (c.f. RBF) being used to enable useful features for non-Bitcoin technologies such as LN.
@_date: 2015-12-03 14:09:11
RBF policies added recently will be massively rejected by users and businesses trying to, you know, use the Bitcoin network for P2P payments without using 3rd parties ... as originally designed. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 05:47:05
... and, what, they can't spend all their money until they get back change from first transaction? 
I wouldn't see that as a major issue unless of course the max block size has been artificially capped so that first transaction is delayed for hours, or days ...

simple fix ... adopt BIP101
@_date: 2015-12-05 08:51:36
Read again and try to follow the actual text on the page, not the stuff in your head. No one is saying Eric wrote those words.
It was not easy to double spend until this "feature" was added. If so, we would have seen merchants handling zero-conf txns screaming for a fix ASAP which did not happen.   
@_date: 2015-12-23 06:02:06
because users asked for this new set of complex coin movements and extra fees, right? and merchants asked for their received coins to be routed through some other network with fees for locking and unlocking the value plus additional fees for insurance, right? 
This is not the Bitcoin described in Satoshi's white paper. This is a vampire squid that has locked onto the face of Bitcoin without choice or consensus.  
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:44:22
This. We are seeing a small group of people decide what Bitcoin should be, based on their own interests and failing to listen to the greater group of users. Fork them, and fork the code so it disables any attempt to limit the block chain for commercial reasons. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 19:18:01
Good compromise, may be accepted by Chinese miners. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 01:51:09
that would introduce an extra layer of complexity and also price volatility. Banks use Collateral + Repo markets so they don't have to trust one another (much) in very s/term trading and settlements.  
@_date: 2015-06-21 04:33:59
Its a MAX size limit, not an absolute level that has to be met in all cases.  
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:55:43
if the side chain token is pegged to the main chain token at a given rate, then a change in price of either means loss of value somewhere.   
Are there any links to explain more fully how the economics of side vs main chains should work in practice? 
@_date: 2015-06-08 13:24:05
people (and banks) would just move on, seeing that the infrastructure failed at small volumes in a way that could have been avoided.
@_date: 2015-06-09 10:46:22
Don't you think this is exactly what people will do? Seems the economic implications of side chains have not been analyzed very deeply. In practice this could devolve into a series of attacks on the main chain in order to take the coins assigned to the side-chain. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 18:51:39
and what market is that? You do realise that the current "market" encourages many free transactions to be included in blocks. Doesn't this say something about how less important the fees are now, while block rewards are so much higher.
@_date: 2015-12-01 22:00:42
thx, corrected
@_date: 2015-06-02 17:35:05
we have trustable exchanges, by virtue of the free market. Technology cannot overcome all of the problems caused by people, and setting up Blockstream or any other commercial enterprise to benefit from artificially boosted fees well before the block reward goes away is just favouring small group(s) of connected developers at the expense of everyone else. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 08:43:02
Same as the open source process, more or less. Banks cooperate on common protocols &amp; services (FIX, Swift), then fork new ones if the current offerings don't or can't meet their requirements.
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:59:03
because ... research and simulations by people who know Bitcoin.
See  for a start.
@_date: 2015-06-15 15:25:00
Amen. Its time for Blockstream to stop blocking Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 03:21:56
Right, so you could assume the writer of the BIP is not opposed to an increase although he is proposing a different method for getting to 8MB. Note the significant opposition for that BIP around giving miners more rights on changing block size, whereas majority of mining capacity has agreed to an 8MB increase. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 06:14:12
thanks for reply, nothing to say a fee market could not happen. 
But, don't you think that at this stage we should be trying to grow the Bitcoin "pie" rather than focusing on how to price minute slices one by one? Imagine if early use of the internet had been subject to detailed charging by usage e.g. 10 cents per email -: we would not have seen the same takeoff and development of services based on network effects.

Dogecoin: billions in circulation, no block size issues and perfect for dodging old debts ... 
@_date: 2015-06-26 09:37:18
Hmmm - why should this be the case? If a side-chain becomes massively popular (utility, security, legality, ...?) then people will switch coins away from BTC and to SideChainCoin. Who will be guaranteeing the 1:1 rate in that case?
@_date: 2015-12-07 01:57:22
Yes, thats most likely. Dodd-Frank has vastly increased cost &amp; regulatory  overhead of trading &amp;b settlement process. Means banks have far too much money locked up in downstream process now compared to profits being made. SETLCoin would be a way to increase the velocity and decrease net quantities of funds involved in settlement ... like RTGS for central banks.
So the shoes still need to be delivered but you don't need a warehouse of 1000's of  shoes just in case trades get messed up and confirmation is delayed, leading to your net delivery being larger.
 
@_date: 2015-12-23 09:40:17
ah, so users are idiots? Nice description of the target audience for Bitcoin. Actually, I think you might find that ordinary folks will reject the silly idea of locking their funds away for weeks or months just for the mere thrill of transacting with Bitcoin as (re)designed by Blockstream.
@_date: 2015-06-03 01:55:52
like any money service business ... but strangely enough the majority in real world dont. any reason why bitcoin as an asset makes it impossible for trusted, long-term businesses to develop?
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:27:00
lets admit once and for all that this is commercial dispute, over who gets the benefits of changing max bock size, or not. Blockstream and similar services may not be needed in short/medium term, if ever, once mining is based around 20MB limit. For myself, I prefer being able to switch mining pools than being forced to use Blockstream or similar because the block chain fees are too high for my transaction. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 12:22:01
So, when are the Blockstream crew and fellow travellers going to offer a viable solution to the current problem? Or will they give up their commit rights as they admit to a conflict of interest and/or inability to continue building what Satoshi started.
The longer it goes without them acting in way to help bring about a solution the majority are waiting for, the sooner Bitcoin Core becomes a historic relic of a failed attempt at "consensus".
@_date: 2015-06-23 08:21:37
I think there are several others around that could fit that ad hominem drive-by comment. Just sayin' ... 
@_date: 2015-06-28 15:00:43
How about limiting commit access to one per company? 
"Decentralized" is a nice term to use (or abuse) in a debate, but seems more than a little ironic when a majority of core dev's work at one firm.
@_date: 2015-12-01 22:24:40
Not sure where satoshi mentioned settlement (or any) layer in his paper titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". Any references?
@_date: 2015-12-09 20:30:21
maybe he is not satoshi (did he exist as only one person?), but perhaps he worked closely with him? all the comments from wright seem to be about how he helped create and "run" Bitcoin, but not about how he is the "one".  
@_date: 2015-06-29 12:04:29
compromise would be good - showing Bitcoin can handle debate and come to a common position.
@_date: 2015-06-20 13:57:51
I dont think its incorrect to say that Blockstream developers have not openly engaged in offering concrete alternatives to Gavin's proposals, various comments on forums aside. Sometimes feels like Blockstream doesn't respect his standing or capacity to offer solutions to Bitcoin Core.
There are various dev comments about a larger block size being required for the future off-chain ideas like lightning, side-chains. If thats really the case then why can't Blockstream offer their plan for review? Why not use their privileged position as core dev's to contribute to the debate in an inclusive fashion? Or does BIP 100 represent the position of Blockstream regarding block size in total?
@_date: 2015-06-11 07:58:38
but it will happen less, providing more room for the overall network to grow while better solutions are found for fees and scalability. 
The current network is a toy in financial technology terms, not a serious contender either as a settlement backbone or payment processing matrix. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 00:51:49
yes, it matters greatly for Lightning. Not so much for the rest of us.

No, but he has probably signed an NDA with R3 and is now making his typical drama-queen moves to get attention(key) and make himself seem oppressed for his noble and righteous beliefs.
Such immature behavior might well be the reason they rejected him as a contractor or employee. Oh, and this the same person pushing contentious, radical changes into Bitcoin code with stated goals of destroying zero-conf transaction as he considers them "fallacies" and "lies" despite merchants protests. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 17:39:35
Please read again, I never mentioned zero-conf. As for adding code that makes double-spending easier, as RBF implementation does, thats guaranteed to make many uses of Bitcoin impossible. Way to go, Core team.

Exactly my point. Ask yourself if email would have grown to the same levels of usage if we had applied an active "fee market" during the period when it was used by 0.00001% of the population.
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:33:04
So what do you think a modest increase would be? And what controls should be added to stop the security model being undermined?
@_date: 2015-12-01 04:44:09
We have that already - Changetip, Coinbase, etc. The Lightning concept and Stroem might be workable solutions in year or 2, perhaps. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 18:29:28
Yes, there was a sequence  number for use in some kind of replacement function. 
But that doesn't mean we should have the current Opt-In Full RBF which was not requested by any merchants or online businesses.
Please read Eric Vorhees post on the whole mess introduced by Core developers not listening to actual Bitcoin business and users:  
@_date: 2015-06-10 04:21:33
Fee market? There is no active, working fee market currently in use as no feedback from failed transactions is made based on the level of fee submitted.  
Even if there were, the block subsidy is worth a great deal more and will be for several more years.

@_date: 2015-06-26 09:50:55
I think, if bitcoin becomes an accepted and secure system, that many large firms (Amazon, Alibaba, TenCent, Utilities, Phone companies) will mine sidechains for their own benefit and for their customers.
Reasons why: keep the connection to their customers, offer improved payment and security features compared to plain vanilla Bitcoin network, morph further into financial services companies without having to rely on traditional networks like Swift, monetize their own tokens &amp; gift cards. For example, Amazon has massive IT infrastructure and billions locked up in gift cards. Having their own crypto-currency which locks in their customers will be impossible to resist, IMHO. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:20:57
free, like Google? hmmm.
@_date: 2015-06-09 03:29:38
Blockstream has a vested interest in delaying an increase in block size until their solutions are ready. Someone holding an opinion on block size before the company was created does not mean there is not a conflict of interest now. There are 21M reasons why this might be the case.
@_date: 2015-06-16 13:02:41
Any hard evidence behind the statement about " ... high chance we'll be seeing 20MB blocks soon ..."? If this is really true then Bitcoin is facing a crisis very soon. if not, maybe this is all just rabble rousing chatter on the internet. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 21:17:11
Altcoins can already function as alternate payment systems, with flexible rates to convert back and forth to/from Bitcoin. No complex additional coding or endless developer consensus wrangling required. Gold, silver, copper, bronze ... all have their uses, values &amp; fans. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 05:03:28
nice rack?
@_date: 2015-12-04 03:23:09
It seems you read the article and missed the essential core argument: having to wait 10 mins (on average, sometimes longer) will ruin many if not all businesses that depend on zero-conf. So it's not a "trivial" change, its one that threatens real, live businesses and services people are using now.
Thats not FUD.
 
@_date: 2015-06-09 03:33:26
Blockstream has no opinion, but it does have a stake in the argument though it's expected future profits. Tell me that doesn't change the debate ever so slightly for the "No" camp. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 03:25:22
Exactly. Ability to code one github repo of c++ code does not an economist make. People talking about 'fee markets' when its clear they know very little how markets can, and do, fail.
@_date: 2015-06-28 14:46:41
people abusing their power to stonewall the removal of a temporary limit, while  declaring the next big thing (sidechains? lightning?) built by their VC-funded company will solve all the issues ... leaves a very bad smell.
Lets call it what it is, Blockstream is blocking Bitcoin.
I propose that core dev's with commit rights be limited to one per company. To avoid exactly this exact conflict of interest in future.

@_date: 2015-06-01 01:19:05
leaving it at 1MB, or even 2, means the network must be supported with commercial services like Blockstream. 
its all about the money, at root, for those opposed to increasing the maximum block size.

kinda amusing that extending block size is a big, bad, horrible risk which requires months of careful checking via simulation on testnet, while messing around with fee policies can be done by 1 person who appears to revel in the fact that wallets are not prepared for his changes.
And if this change will help average bitcoin holders, miners, merchants to secure their funds ... it sure hasn't been marketed as such.
@_date: 2015-06-01 13:02:59

@_date: 2015-06-10 17:38:46
and .... people, normal people, simply will not use a system like that. Does Visa or Mastercard come back and ask you to submit a payment request with increased fees? No way, no how, aint gonnna work ...
The "core" devs are showing their economic naivety or vested interests - either way Bitcoin should not be held hostage to the naive and/or commercially motivated. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 06:46:30
Because in the real world Visa doesn't send back your credit card slip and ask you to add/bump up the processing fee leaving you to stay in the restaurant, bill unpaid. 
The fee "market" is new, untested for dynamic resolution of "too many tx, not enough fee" scenarios and is extremely user-unfriendly now. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:20:57
free, like Google? hmmm.
@_date: 2015-06-10 04:29:26
This sounds unrealistic, even naive, in economic terms. 
Do we expect resources to be committed to building and running side-chains, when no profit can be made from doing so? If there is a profit (e.g. running millions of off-block-chain "coffee" payments txns for a fee) then the side chain tokens must have a value, which will fluctuate depending on input costs, supply/demand, fees provided ...
Its a little strange that proponents of side-chains will argue that a fee market would be denied by increasing block size and also that a fixed peg with no change in side-chain token values can be used for a new area of functionality with commercial drivers and results. 
Economics matters everywhere, surely?
@_date: 2015-06-24 09:39:22
That would be great. Its a very good series for developers to get involved in learning about Bitcoin, but some may not be experienced coders or else comfortable in C. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 03:21:34
Blockstream is blocking, for commercial reasons. Likewise, other naysayers have agendas which they will not openly discuss. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 13:47:43
Surely it is FUD to inject a single comment out of context like that.
No-one is denying the possibility of something like that happening for larger blocks - but the original block size was 32MB and tests are not showing any ill effects from increasing the max possible block size.
We can only grow Bitcoin by solving problems now one by one, not by ignoring them until disaster hits or pretending some other future innovation might save us ... 
@_date: 2015-06-17 07:51:17
Right. I sense there will need to be an app for deciding how your payment should be processed, with fees. 
I am going to call this app "Consensus".
... profit!
@_date: 2015-06-18 13:51:23
Please read the blog posting series by Gavin A. The solution to the near-term problem of full blocks is increasing the block size to an agreed number - currently that looks like 8MB. This buys time for other scalability solutions to be built, tested and agreed as well as making improvements in Bitcoin code. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 15:36:58
I'd increase, not decrease, the number and limit it to one per company for a max period of two years. The perception of conflicted interest is just as bad as the actual thing ... 
Question: If all the core developers bar one are opposed, how do you explain BIP100?
@_date: 2015-12-01 22:37:00
... all leading to off-chain solutions such as Liquid(tm), Lightning(tm) created by VC-funded private company named Blockstream which pays salary of majority of Core developers. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 19:16:03
And why would that be such a bad thing? why pre-limit the use of the block chain to transactions that you, or Luke-Jr, think are worthy? 
@_date: 2015-06-23 08:38:40
hmmm, last bank I worked for had 25,000 physical servers - each of which could be dedicated to mining if needed. Plus another 20k desktops with installed tools for running distributed tasks, currently being used for this purpose already. Oh, and another internal cloud-based grid service with more than 20k cores. 
Enough to make a difference, you think?
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:15:08
who decides the amount(value) that is transferred back? Can I transfer 0.001 BTC to gain 1000 GarbageCoin then later transfer back 1 GarbageCoin because its now worth 0.001 BTC? According to who? And how can the transfer be blocked if GarbageCoin value turns out to be faked?
@_date: 2015-06-09 03:39:55
Can we simplify the debate to 8MB or No Change? Final offer from all sides. There has been enough talk and, IMHO, Gavin has tried very hard to find a sensible compromise. 
8MB or No - whats the answer?  
@_date: 2015-06-18 17:12:33
I don't see compromise coming from the 1MB camp, please correct me if I have missed any proposal that doesn't involve an emergency fix once network has crashed. Mike is using the XT thing as  a threat, no-one has to use that version unless they choose to.
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:47:03
good enough for now, and maybe the next time it'll be easier.  
@_date: 2015-06-19 21:47:03
Conflict is not removed because there was no commercial incentive before and now it exists. Please give other people some credit for being able to see the obvious conflict when you're not able to.
As for lightning and sidechains - since they benefit from larger block size please itemize the size increase you support for this and the date on which it should be available.   
@_date: 2015-12-23 06:12:09
Like with RBF changes? It strains belief in a major way to think that a simple change to revert Bitcoin back towards it's previous max block size limits would take years to prepare for and test ... but jamming in controversial changes affecting real businesses using Bitcoin is done quickly and by stealth means without consensus. 
This is not conservative or safe practice by any measure you could apply in technology-based product development. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 00:49:37

@_date: 2015-06-14 13:34:30
Agreed. Raising the possibility of drastic solutions is sometimes needed to get peoples attention &amp; provoke more reasonable alternatives.
@_date: 2015-06-14 03:39:01
Can you explain how fees going up 100X will spur growth in users? Can you confirm that the 'fee market" would handle this scenario smoothly, without failing transactions and not giving users notice? 
I realize monetizing a limited resource is an easier sell to profit-focused investors, but how will that actually work in practice during the next 12 months when none of the promised solutions like lightning, side chains, active fee market will be ready for use? 
@_date: 2015-12-01 17:55:21
do you have running code and test data for your proposed option around a 2-4-8 increase?
@_date: 2015-06-19 21:20:34
Thats BS. Please stop repeating lies and FUD. 
What size should the block be increased to in next 12 months?
If you don't support an increase, against the wishes of the vast majority of business and users of Bitcoin - when will you resign from your current role as a Core Dev and give up commit rights to the Git repo?
@_date: 2015-06-16 13:54:34
true, we cannot outrun physics forever ... but for now why not buy a few years to fully explore optimisations and 2nd layer solutions.

@_date: 2015-06-01 20:35:15
You're optimizing prematurely. Bitcoin needs to grow first, before any fee market can emerge. Increasing the block size to 8MB helps it to grow in a simple way.  
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:27:00
lets admit once and for all that this is commercial dispute, over who gets the benefits of changing max bock size, or not. Blockstream and similar services may not be needed in short/medium term, if ever, once mining is based around 20MB limit. For myself, I prefer being able to switch mining pools than being forced to use Blockstream or similar because the block chain fees are too high for my transaction. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 13:21:35

@_date: 2015-06-24 15:08:21
This is clearly behind some of the core dev comments about not being interested in a project which becomes too "centralized". It would be a shame to lose the knowledge and skills of these folk, but one thing managing software developers &amp; teams has taught me is any developer can be replaced and should be if the net effect of their presence on a team is negative.  
  
   
@_date: 2015-12-01 04:42:22
Not really, Bitcoin protocol can serve multiple purposes. You are just limiting the scope of Bitcoin network when it's actual constraints (block size, network, throughput) have not been optimized yet.
@_date: 2015-06-09 03:49:22
How exactly does this differ from using Citibank/HSBC/BOA/ChangeTip/Coinbase to aggregate transactions and settle the net amount on the blockchain? How is this actually "decentralized' in any meaningful way when a company controls the source code and development?

If the proposed change goes ahead and is successful, will those opposed give up their roles as core devs and their commit rights? Or else come up with improvements in the process that might lead to hard forks in future to avoid all this contention?
It seems that usually when people don't agree with a policy decision in an organisation they resign or try to change the process so the policy "mistake", in their view, cannot be repeated.

@_date: 2015-12-06 19:40:42
Nobody there is pushing for BIP101 to be deployed &amp; used any time soon. In fact, you might not guess the conference is held to solve any current or near-term scalability issues if you viewed the list of accepted presentations. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 10:02:37
And the two sets of fees will be the same? Given different technologies employed, different block sizes, different mining durations ...
if not the same fees, main and side chains will be subject to different economic drivers and factors =&gt; leading to different prices for coins on the main and side chains.

Why not setup virtual, p2p bank-like structures that offer banking services. For example, instead of taking deposits from investors and using them as a reserve for gambling ( e.g.  ) the funds could be applied to providing loans to small business, for auto purchases, etc.

He is correct. Does anyone believe that side chains are so revolutionary an advance that it could not be built into the core protocol given time, testing and an agreed consensus?

and delaying an increase while we are seeing spam attacks and blocks fill up is no risk at all?
and rushing through some "off-chain" payment solution (since satoshi forgot to build a payment system, apparently) is no risk either in infrastructure, security or financial terms for Bitcoin itself?
and allowing the current disfunctional core dev setup to continue is no risk to decision-making capacity for Bitcoin?

@_date: 2015-08-17 12:25:47
Afraid that is not a valid description of the mining process as it relates to including amounts of transactions. You left out the race between miners to solve the block ... there is a trade-off between including more transactions for income, and solving the block earlier. 
If that is included then there would be an optimum size block in relation to the block size selected by other miners. Too big and you get more income but solve less blocks, too small and you miss out on fee income. Increasing the max block size increases the capacity of the network, but doesnt absolutely set the "best" block size at any level below or eual to the max. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 09:02:39
no one here is suggesting the max block size be removed completely  ... a cap is a good thing. And keeping that max block size cap in line with the needs of a growing network, using pointers from infrastructure growth, is also a good thing. 
Note also that if you think spam, whatever fits your definition, is a bad thing then increasing the block size makes spam attacks more expensive.

there are 21M reasons why Blockstream needs and wants the max block size to remain at 1MB until they have a viable product ready for use.
Its blindingly obvious that limited block capacity and fee pressure are required for BS to succeed, once the code is written and tested. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 12:02:57
Since substantive arguments against using an increased max block size have been lost among miners, developers, payment processors  the small-blockers (those against raising max block size to 8MB by Jan/2016 earliest) are now pumping out FUD, slander and claims of stolen naming at a furious rate. 
Re diagram above: this is pretty pathetic - are we supposed to believe this is one of the tech leaders of the new BTC revolution? By generating such low-grade, incoherent propaganda as if we are serfs who will follow whatever is presented by the Blockstream team behind the green curtain.

Except the Core devs have not shown they can resolve this in a clear manner that gets buy-in from all interested parties. Whatever the technical merits or otherwise, of keeping blocksize at 1MB  its obvious the same human consensus and communication issue will happen again. A solution is required for Bitcoin to grow.
@_date: 2015-08-27 07:10:22
You're aware that adding all Nasdaq trades, or worlds coffees, as transactions will drive up fee levels, surely. Why do you think those transactions are not "Bitcoin (the currency) transactions"? And why are you trying to treat the Blockchain as something with strictly limited supply at this early stage?  
I think it would be best if you, Adam and the rest of Blockstream moved to a different coin which can support the different vision of Bitcoin as originally described in white paper and as most people want.

@_date: 2015-08-24 06:10:21
Max block size will have increased by that time, which means in case of higher transaction demand the network will be generating increased fee income. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 14:45:58
Thanks for the answer. My question was also about the time needed to execute a LN transaction from end to end, with hub ready or no hub setup. Somehow I doubt that all the extra steps required for LN tx could make it as fast as a zero-conf tx on Bitcoin. If so, that may explain the resistance to 0-conf tx among Blockstream team and their acolytes. 
@_date: 2015-08-07 13:32:20
Exactly - one possible risk is that a SC gains some advantage over the MC which core Devs refuse to add to MC. Value of MC BTC and SCT BTC would begin to separate and the fixed Peg would not hold. Those  who moved their coins earlier would have a massive advantage over those who kept coins on MC.

@_date: 2015-07-19 13:12:20
Fees are around 1% of the block reward now, so using fee levels to drive changes in miners behaviour seems ineffectual and premature. Unless its being done to prove a point or influence some future commercial opportunity.
I would say : leave the code as is and let the ecosystem fill the gaps where customer needs are driving innovation.

True in the mis-reading, my apologies. 
A similar question comes from re-reading the rest of the paragraph. Why would it be a red mark on XT developers to keep tx format the same? Surely if they are working on the same Bitcoin protocol as Core they should only build what works for all Bitcoin miners - anything else would be a fork into an alt coin. 
Just because one group of developers maintains a github repo named "Core" doesn't stop others from building on the exact same protocol and becoming the reference implementation if they have a version that offers the features users/miners/merchants want. This is a strength of Bitcoin and open source code.
@_date: 2015-07-21 09:27:51
nah, sweet as ... 
@_date: 2015-08-17 03:04:16
I believe so. The max block size debate is really centered around the number of transactions that stay in Blockchain vs those routed through proposed "layer 2" solutions like Strawpay, Lightning. 
Restricting Blockchain from processing transactions limits the fee income and hence network security. Note that one possible outcome of using 2-way pegs is that funds moved to a side chain will stay there, meaning that under some scenarios alternate payment networks will bleed the life from the Blockchain by extracting fees and finally coins. Which is fine if a better solution is made available for people to opt into, but not if its given a leg-up by limiting Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-22 13:50:10
But you, or your investors, do stand to gain from higher fees that drive transactions away from the main Blockchain to alternate processing networks, right?  
Please reply in the affirmative or else provide the official policy of Blockstream on how, when and by how much the block size limit should be increased?  
@_date: 2015-08-06 16:57:55

Given the overlap between core developers and its staff, there is a clear, open conflict of interest which is now causing damage to Bitcoin the network.
@_date: 2015-07-22 12:29:05
One small request in case things come to pass - could the future XT developers with commit rights be limited to one (maybe 2) per company? This would avoid the appearance and possibility of conflict of interest caused by many developers from one company having commit rights.

" the changed version (Bitcoin-XT in this case) will have a different transaction structure for txs that take place after the blockchain split, so that transactions on one network will never be valid on the other, and vice versa."
As far as I understand, XT does not have a different transaction structure to Core. Else how are XT nodes currently mining blocks which are being accepted? Can you confirm on his and update the statement above, if so, to avoid adding to confusion on XT vs Core around upcoming fork.

Regarding off-chain transaction networks like ChangeTip, Coinbase, Circle, exchanges ... one major difference is that NONE of these are pushing for 1MB max block size limit, unlike Blockstream.

@_date: 2015-07-20 03:12:48
Err, the 1% estimate refers to the share of total money earned from mining (fees, block reward). So we are talking about 1% of 1-5% only. 
Running some numbers downloaded from blockchain.info shows the fee reward to be averaging just under 0.50% over last 3 months. Which shows that trying to change miner behaviour through changing fee policy is using the wrong tool at this time. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 11:21:53
"decentralization" as a word means exactly what? Those wishing to limit the scale and scope of the bitcoin network seem to have a definition which suits their interests. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 04:09:44
in trading there are actually multiple databases run by the market operators (CFTC, NYSE, NASDAQ, ...) and also by each market trader (GS, JPM, ...). So one of the biggest costs of trading is synch'ing between all the databases e.g. my companies balance(net B/S trades) with GS may not agree with their balance due to human error, computer error. So humans will have to investigate and remedy these "breaks" - which costs time and money. 
Now with advent of Dodd-Frank and other regulatory reporting regimes, the mistake ("break") above may be enough to push my company over the line of acceptable trading limits if not resolved ASAP.
Using blockchain will lower rate of errors and reduce costs of monitoring and fixing the "breaks" as we have a global, perfect database to measure against.

I think you are talking about how markets react to news, given more or less liquidity. Any market with greater liquidity will show less kurtosis i.e. the same news should provoke smaller changes in price and fewer extreme moves in a liquid market.

@_date: 2015-07-22 13:57:30
we have that in place already. but since fees are averaging 0.5% of the block reward, it's a very weak price signal to be using for changing miners behaviour. 
Lets push the amateur economist BS to the side and stop pretending the debate is actually about technology or some disfunctional "fee" market. Its about winners and losers, specifically the money invested in some solutions and maintaining control over Bitcoin to ensure the investors in those companies are paid out to the max.

How can the proposed layer 2 network offer lower fees to users AND higher fees to miners, while each tx on the proposed network is still a Bitcoin tx? Why would miners stay on the main chain while they can earn more elsewhere? Why would Bitcoins on the main and side chains stay at the same price given such different revenue outcomes for miners?
The proposed technology might be quite advanced, given the people involved and the 21M in VC funding - but the economics don't seem to add up at all, IMHO.

It's "instant" like a bank TT is "instant", meaning users can move on with their daily life and assume once the transaction has been initiated the money will be delivered on the standard timeline for the service.
If you can try seeing things from the user POV then "instant" is a 100% correct  description. OTOH, if everything to do with Bitcoin is now being filtered w.r.t. Blockstream/Block Size/Fee "Market" debates then no single description can be left alone until it serves the cause of "1MB FOREVER" ...

Moving the max blocksize back up again is in fact a slam dunk, actually. Tests have been run, simulations made, effects of the filling up of blocks have been quantified. It's a simple change that a few people, for various reasons, have made complex.
OTOH, changing the way that UTXO inputs are handled because of some vague notions about a more efficient fee market, or removing "spam" _ is _ a complex change which should be treated with far more care. Especially when coders start trying to act as economists ...

hmmm. Why should developers be selecting business practices that are "acceptably secure"? Are we moving to a truly global p2p e-cash network enabling valid businesses to operate outside the constraints of fiat banking, or just substituting another set of biases and vested interests?

You don't seem to appreciate how small, flaky (core dev setup) and under-powered the Bitcoin network really is.
Just one of the banks I worked for had server count amounting to 25,000 plus another grid with 20,000 cores. If and when they figure out real, viable business cases for running a Blockchain network plus any regulatory issues then Bitcoin (hobby version) will be made redundant overnight.
Mike is 10000% correct on this: mass adoption &amp; use could save Bitcoin from becoming the Napster/Friendster of digital currencies, while keeping Bitcoin network capacity &amp; dev governance as it is will almost certainly end in failure or irrelevance.

A fee market already exists and has always existed for BTC. In economic terms fee level is a weak indicator and actor in the market ( &lt; 1% of block reward last time I looked ).
Perhaps what you mean is a large enough amount of fee income to reward on and off chain economic interests. For off-chain solutions like Lightning(Blockstream), competing with zero or very low fees is tough given additional trust, regulatory, security challenges.  
@_date: 2015-11-13 16:08:50

Good to see a trusted alternative to Blockstream Core implementation developing.

@_date: 2015-09-24 02:40:45
Pls scroll back up and read your own words ... "BTW this does nothing to support block size increase". 
In fact, the idea Gavin is supporting WILL support max block size increase based on the description of how it works. A possible, unproven side-effect is that this, like all infrastructure optimizations, may favour large miners. Even if true, it doesnt negate the support provided for increased max block size. 
Clear enough?  
@_date: 2015-09-01 02:06:56
Perhaps he is referring to the opposition by Blockstream employees and contractors to his BIP101 proposal. Opposing BIP101 means, in practice, staying with 1MB max block size. Its notable that the only simple alternative to BIP101 by J Garzik came from a non-Blockstream core developer, until XT was released ...

Thats a subsidy, not an externality. It does result in a positive externality by way of increased txn volume - which is a very very good thing during growth phase of Bitcoin network.
Current 'income' for your costs comes in block rewards &amp; fees, with about 99% to 1% split between the two last time I checked. At current prices and 1/2 schedule it will take many years before fees make a real contribution to covering costs. As for having fees cover 100% of network cost, this will need increased volume (hence max block size increase) if we considered same set of network metrics &amp; costs. Forcing fees higher by imposing block size limits is economically naive and damaging, possibly fatal to Bitcoin. People will never pay $10/txn unless extreme &amp; rich libertarians.
I do share your concern on whether Bitcoin can finally pay its way, minus subsidy - but to me its simply not a pressing issue now or for next few years while usage is so small and technology is developing. 
@_date: 2015-11-19 22:56:11

Yes, there seems to be a correlation between these kind of attacks and certain personal agendas re Blockchain design.

style vs content. 
The PT style of argument and counter-argument shows the style of a desperate techie prima donna who so so wants his stuff to be included in core Bitcoin i.e. "The Sky is falling. quick! use my code now!"
The content of MH postings &amp; answers shows clear thinking, reasonable assumptions and use of common scenarios to back up his concepts i.e. "The sky is not falling - look out the window".

I have nothing against innovation providing similar (or better) features which traditional finance tech employs now. 
But its still a different vision than that laid out in white paper and maybe raises questions, in my mind, on how Blockchain development is being handled now and in future.

Sure, and Changetip is just a couple of BTC transactions to/from a known address so ... its Bitcoin!

Apologies if I assumed too much from your text. I think analysis shows networking costs are a very small part of mining budgets, so any increase in block size should have minimal effects. Cost of orphan blocks may be more important. See  for a much better review of the topic than I can summarize.

Well, he may have done for all you and I know. Does it really matter? As developer of first &amp; biggest SPV implementation maybe you could just let that slide, given all work he did from an early time when Bitcoin was unknown. 
A little generosity and empathy on all sides could ease a great deal of this negative crap going on, don't you think?

downvoting != censorship. 
censorship is banning people for making legitimate posts on topics that should be feely discussed. 
censorship is hiding/deleting posts on topics defined by mods in purely subjective fashion according to some 'trolling == ////' rules.

You seem to have litle idea on what makes a market. A market for fees already exists and operates fine now, as planned by Satoshi. 
Why are fees sometimes zero and yet still txns get included in a block? Because, like any market outside of a textbook, there are imperfections and externalities influencing actors behavior. 
In case of Bitcoin, miners include free txn's because at this stage of Bitcoin growth &amp;&amp; given current block reward its a GOOD THING to encourage use of BTC network and increase usability by letting more people use it. As Satoshi designed and intended it to be.
Charging min txn fee &gt;= marginal mining cost is rational in a perfect, developed market only. How would email have developed if we were charged fees starting six years from its beginning? Not much, I suspect.

Could this be turned into a Repo i.e. send some BTC to get fiat paid, then return BTC after 24 hours? With some small fee + cost of hedging BTC. 
Some TTP (bank?) would need to confirm the fiat transfers out &amp; back. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 06:46:57
Mikes argument was neither fallacious nor an appeal to Authority, just a bit imprecise on use of the term "SPV". Anyway, as the quotes show, everyone is wrong - a good outcome for a meaningless quibble over nothing much.
The quotes you refer to are pretty interesting, seems that Satoshi was far less doctrinaire and rigid on how the network would be built out than many of the current followers of BTC protocol.
@_date: 2015-10-01 04:19:37
No. Mike brings a different view and has the knowledge and experience to offer a great deal of value to the Bitcoin network.
Bitcoin will not reach its potential if group-think and internet trollery lead to talented, sometimes difficult, developers being ejected from the community.

Could be due to XT's current levels of take-up, but from email list and IRC logs seems more like protecting SPV functionality is the concern driving his actions &amp; reactions. Oh, and there appears to be sme history in these dev conflicts, too ...
2 things that would be nice to see: 
1) Bitcoin Core offering to go the extra mile on finding ways to protect against double-spend or other security risks affecting SPV wallets during soft -fork releases 2) Mike offering to meet and discuss blocksize compromise solution in person, perhaps in HK.     
@_date: 2015-11-05 15:52:27
May I ask what, if anything, are you proposing?
@_date: 2015-10-18 13:20:37
No, its not any more useful than existing remittance options based on Bitcoin as transfer currency. In fact, its worse as you have no ability to cash out in fiat without waiting for e.g. days to pass AML/Money Transfer delays. 
Piachu is right - instant transfer of BTC is not very innovative in 2015, real innovation would be an RTGS settling fiat and other assets.      
@_date: 2015-11-03 07:36:32
I call BS ... discussions on soft vs hard did NOT reach consensus and I did not see Wlad intervene or advise need for consensus.
Mike is correct in that Core decison making is broken and many/most developers are frozen out if not part of BS group and anyone who agrees with them. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 08:14:38
of course, names and volunteer status are public info. You can google "reddit" and "blockstream" to find more on the small group blocking progress on adjusting max block size back in the direction of its previous value.

"SPV" as a term is not in the white paper. So he is technically correct, and probably justified in saying that since he built the first, and biggest, SPV implementation.
But hey, lets not stop the internet mob attack on someone who has built a great deal of Bitcoin infrastructure over last 1/2 decade or more.

Err, yes they can &amp; most likely will do. To them a blockchain is a cool, distributed database that appears to work, so far, for small number of users and very low transaction capacity. 
Naturally, they will be looking to radically improve scaling of block chains - or did you think that banking geeks could not improve on what was/is written by current devs? 
@_date: 2015-10-26 03:17:55

yeah, maybe. As described, LN hubs will hold BTC that can be attributed to known addresses and collect fees from people &amp; legal entities, paying them to hub owners/operators. 
Wishing and hoping your LN hub will not treated as a money transfer service is not going to be enough to avoid regulation, unfortunately.

I'm confused by ABs confusing comment.
Isnt Blockstream now touting benefits of private, permissioned side chains to large financial companies so as to make a return on 21M invested by a VC company? How does that not conflict with Satoshi's original vision?    
@_date: 2015-11-14 03:25:50
Don't the snowden revelations show that ALL technology is within government reach? To my way of thinking, it's not a realistic decentralized solution to have the network beyond government reach - that's impossible. A robust decentralized BTC network would have a wide variety of nodes deployed by all kinds of people &amp; organizations. strength in diversity.

@_date: 2015-10-02 00:35:36
Yup - software doesn't have hissy fits, unless you count kernel panics ... Maybe we should call a halt to all Bitcoin Core development for five years, just lifting the max block size from 1MB to 4MB in case usage grows. 
Then Bitcoin developers can devote their time 100% to fighting, censoring, banning, slandering and trolling activities ...  ;-)

Answer is: they are not. There is a path where A trusts B to handle e.g. Russian transactions for delivery. B trusts C, D, E ... as they operate in same legal setup and/or have a netting agreement to minimize their exposure. Google for Nostro &amp; Vostro accounts plus Herstatt risk.

I feel for the guy, his frustration is quite evident.

This really starts to look like a hard rift in bitcoin dev between those associated with blockstream (alternate payment network related to BTC) and those connected with payment companies and wallets(Core BTC payment network). 
Various personalities aside, this could be an ugly d.i.v.o.r.c.e coming up ... NOT a good thing for the Bitcoin network, but if the commercial interests are not compatible then separation might be best.

No, it would be an epic failure due to flawed understanding of basic economics and competing products which are available and working now. 
For example I can transfer money from my account to any other account for FREE in many countries. Bitcoin is a great innovation but I don't see any scenario for most people where a $20 fee could be justified. Perhaps terrorists, or money launderers or drug cartels?
