Does it have an API or webhooks? Where did you find documentation?

Thank you for this. Is this for use with bitcoind? If not, which software?

And this applies to you, too.

Everyone must start somewhere. I have 14 years of web development experience. All I need to do is research how Bitcoin works.
If someone wants something, all they have to do is put their mind to it and go for it, and that is what I am doing.
It's clear you are a pessimist and not an entrepreneur type -- how unfortunate for you.

I wonder if this would still be necessary if satoshibet had chosen to incorporate in a country that would keep their information private from inquiring governments. Some South American or Eastern European country perhaps. I'm sure they could serve the site from there to US players with no legal issues.
I wonder where satoshibet is incorporated.

Makes sense. Thanks for the feedback!

So, this would be where you deposit funds by sending Bitcoins to your wallet on this web site, yeah? Do you have any suggestions on how to decrease confirmation time?
Based on  it seems there is always an unavoidable delay when transferring Bitcoins. I'm not sure how the delay could be avoided, especially considering fraud potential.
It looks like there is potential for fraud ("double spend") in relation to Bitcoin transfers. Maybe a small transaction fee would help reduce fraud potential.

Noted! Thanks, Tim, for the feedback. If you have any other ideas, feel free to add more, any time.
