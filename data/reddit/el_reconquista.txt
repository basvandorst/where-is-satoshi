I'm not saying that, but if you think Bitcoin will survive as a transaction medium for only rich people I think you're mistaken. There are plenty of coins that even do that better, ETH for example.

So btc is only for rich people now?

The market won't demand anything if the technology is not solid enough. The market will simply pick another crypto that fulfills their needs better.

You're absolutely right, but this goes for Bitcoin too.

Wouldn't BCH be the more conservative choice, since it is a simple non disruptive on-chain scaling solution envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto since the beginning?

Fair points. I still prefer the BCH strategy of making Bitcoin usable now and working future kinks related to bigger blocks out as they come, but this gave me a better idea of what Core is trying to achieve, much appreciated.

Isn't it worth the sacrifice to make sure Bitcoin has any use case at all? Because the way this is going, Bitcoin won't have any use except being a speculative vehicle, which sounds awfully close to being a ponzi scheme. 
While your argument for keeping nodes cheap and accessible is valid, the technology to run a high-end node will only get cheaper each year. I don't have any hard data to be sure this offsets the increased load that big blocks bring, but it seems regressive to keep technology behind just to cater to the lowest common denominator.  Bitcoin transfer fees, in contrast to hardware prices, only keep rising (money that could have gone towards running said nodes). 
I don't see why widespread adoption is inevitable at this point, current adoption is mostly based on greed and first mover advantage only goes so far. If BTC stays this unusable and divided I could see superior blockchain based solutions easily pushing it out.

I was genuinely wondering and not trying to make a point with my question, so thanks for the elaborate and thoughtful reply. You make a good point about on-chain scaling being a dead end ultimately, but it seems to me that with the current advancements in data storage technology, an increase to 8mb blocks is a minimal compromise considering the currently huge fees and slowness of BTC. I personally started reading up about the big block debate recently because I noticed myself how ridiculously long transactions were taking, which is frankly a pretty huge dealbreaker for a digital form of transactioning. Would it not be reasonable to both increase blocksize and implement an off-chain solution for micro transactions?

But the technology is pretty shit compared to other cryptos.

Satoshi is a "she" now? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:34:54
People want both coins. I expect a big sell off after the split.

Rumour has it Satoshi's a nonbinary pansexual otherkin.
