I remember more the 4k memes. Particularly that one about the hard fork: "It's spelled hard 4k". I chuckled at that one.

You literally stated that the 16k buyers had a set back of 30hs to 1 week. If thats not prett much the same as saying that every dip will continuemoving up then i dont know what you even meant.

Yeah that's one of the main reasons why I want to buy bitcoins. Then again, corruption? For how little I've read and seen so far about cryptocurrency, there is a staggering amount of scammers in the wild.

From what I hear this sub might not be for you then...

Where did I say or imply that? And what's your point?
I live where I live, it's not like I have a choice. Did you choose where you wanted to be born?

I want to buy coins. Mining is pointless if I don't have the proper hardware... and even then.

Do you happen to know other *more mature* places to discuss cryptocurrency? With all the scammers lying around it's kinda hard to figure out who's legit and who's just trying to waste my time.

I'm still figuring out how to buy bitcoins in my country. I only have a debit card and not a credit card, so it's not as simple for me.

Thanks. Yeah I know faucets are kinda sketchy by design (witdraw fees costs are so high it takes days just to get that much crypto).
I'm still figuring out how to buy bitcoins in my country, while also learning all I can about it in the meantime. Like I said I'm a total newbie, so of course I haven't read that much yet. And while I learn how to buy bitcoins, I'm doing these captchas to get at least those satoshis and see where that gets me and if I eventually can actually convert them to something that feels more "real", even if it's less than a dollar.

What's wrong with Chris Dunn if I may ask? I'm new around here.

I have Xapo and Satoshitango to buy bitcoins locally. I think there are others.
