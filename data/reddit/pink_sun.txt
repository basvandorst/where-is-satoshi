Fair enough, interesting. Would you have any source for that info?
But that doesn't really answer the question.
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:19:22
The network, anyone. It's like asking who is verifying that a miner did find the hash in bitcoin to mine the next block? Everyone can check it, but only by being physically closer to the satellite, you will get an edge over the others to find the hash.
@_date: 2019-07-11 17:07:02
See, now you don't disagree with the fact that these satellites could provide benefits, but with the fact that it would bring centralization because building and maintaining such satellites would need a specific entity, and I agree with that. I didn't see the problem at first, but still the OP is about the feasibility and usefulness or some proof of location on to of POW, not about bitcoin adopting it tomorrow specifically.
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:12:14


Could you elaborate? This would prevent specific countries, groups, or more generally, any entity restricted to a specific location, to possess a large part of the mining power, how is that not inherently good?
@_date: 2019-07-02 13:50:01
Ok, I understand, it has multiple utility actually.
@_date: 2019-07-09 10:56:44
Why? Is that something new on Reddit? When you ask a question to people, you have to code things up? Great input...
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:05:02
All what you say about bitcoin is true, I understand that. That is why I ask if there is any protocol out there that has a way to avoid miner's centralization.
@_date: 2019-07-02 16:06:33
Isn't the previous block hash random?
@_date: 2019-07-12 14:11:49


You wrote that, right?
Hence me saying that bitcoin is not the point of the OP. The title question is clear.
Anyway, please go bark somewhere else.
@_date: 2019-07-09 12:13:34
That's true. It would need to come from donations or smthg like that.
Or... we forget the satellites and it's all about miners respective's position that the code is dealing with. There has to be a way. The critial points are that some physical parameters can't be cheated on, and that there is no incentive for individual miners to mess with that system or try to avoid it. Because the gain is too small for individual miners to mess, it's again a 51% thing but this time with a more geographically decentralized net. Everyone individually wins that the system is more secure.
@_date: 2019-07-07 12:38:45
Omg really? Andreas A. is your suggestion at that point.
I think you need to re-read the OP and its different answers, but thank you for the effort.
@_date: 2019-07-07 12:36:48
Haha I think that "you" don't understand that we understand that very well..
@_date: 2019-07-06 11:05:01
I'm saying that the new block's transactions, and hash, could decide on who will be the one to decide on the ordering of the "next" block. Because these transactions come randomly from users, one could not know who will be the validator for the next block before that the previous block is full.
@_date: 2019-07-06 12:41:11
What you say isn't clear, could you elaborate?
@_date: 2019-07-09 17:26:11
It's not about GPS coordinates, it's about receiving photons quicker than other miners because they are closer to a specific satellite, it's uncheatable. But yes, this world currency would need a couple satellites. Which I would not call "absurdly complicated for such a specific task". A couple satellites for something that can be worth trillions is a drop in the bucket. But the real problem, as mentioned below, is that a satellite fleet is somehow centralized because of the people who build it and maintain it.
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:14:04


You see it the wrong way around. The proof would not work by showing maximum distance like in your example, but minimum distance. You don't prove that you're far away from China, but you have to prove that you're close to, say, Bolivia. And as a Chinese miner you could not get the info as fast as an Argentinian miner would. The later could be given an edge, and this edge would be distributed in time and space by the protocol. Hence distributing miners.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:50:07
I think the problem is not to decide randomly who is the next node. A pseudo-random algo depending for example on previous transactions, which are random, is easy to implement. The problem is that we don't know who are the nodes, because they come and go and can be created at will. There are no defined and countable nodes in the network any given time. That is the issue, not the random selection.
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:54:52
It's true that the use of computational power to serve other purposes is not really a threat to bitcoin, because all miners could do that. I understand now. However, and I wasn't clear about this at first, I think this will not "solve" the energy use of bitcoin because all miners would grow bigger for these purposes and would end up using even more energy all together. So I doubt that would make bitcoin any cleaner at all, which one argument of these project that I criticize.
@_date: 2019-07-11 17:54:50
First, you again say "bitcoin", when I did not mention it a single time in the OP. I am clearly thinking of the usability or not of proof of location on top of POW. Satellites being one possible solution, and bitcoin one possible currency. With satellites, only donation to build them and maintain them would keep the system decentralized, but again, this is interesting but not the point of the OP.
Second, you stating, there are no benefits, with such certainly, is wow... at best showing your lack of imagination. Satellites are certainly going to serve some function of these kind, for which ever digital currencies are going to be around in a few decades.
Third, you almost insult me now. Have fun browsing reddit.
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:11:26
Nope. Because, again speed of light is finite, and the time for your signal to travel the Earth will make it way to late for your miner to get the edge. 
You give a natural edge to miners that are closer to the satellite. Like they can mine a little before the others. And over the time, and as the satellite turns around Earth, it would distribute/give the edge everywhere it passes by. The incentive for natural spread out of miners would simply depend on the mechanism/the amount of edge you give to miners closer to the satellite.
So sending a signal from China to Antarctica, doesn't help anything for your miner.
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:06:52
No I'm not talking about the great firewall, I'm talking about miners' centralization in general, and crypto projects in general. Is there any protocol out there or even is the research stage that deals with miner's centralization?
@_date: 2019-07-24 14:45:22
I agree with you, and btw I don't understand why so many miners are in China given your point.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:41:04
Basically, no pain, no gain.
Thanks a lot for the answers.
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:16:52
It doesn't matter. The competition would still be here between miners, and they would still try to get cheap electricity. The rules would just be slightly different.
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:25:38
The algo would make that the miners closer to the satellite would have a slight edge, and as the satellite turns around Earth, the edge is distributed. So the satellite is the bottleneck, yes, but there is no real incentive for miners to shut it down because then we would be back to mining as it is now, not a big difference on the short term. And anyway there could be 4-5 satellites doing that job.
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:57:07
I's not anti-science. It's not pro-science. It is simply a currency, or store of value. The mechanism which makes it work should not be mixed up with other things in an attempt to make it "useful". It is already useful and serving its purpose.
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:27:20
It's like saying observing interstellar clouds is to specific of a task for deserving satellites. Man, astrophysics is not even a hundred billion dollar field. Digital assets and money will be trillions of dollars. So, contrarily to what you say, indeed digital assets could afford hundreds of satellites with atomic clocks on-board if it turns to be any useful. And it will, there's no doubt. Not necessarily for the reason I'm suggesting, but they will.
@_date: 2019-07-03 09:46:32
Really? Doesn't it depend partly on the transactions from users, which are unpredictable, and that make up the block?
And if it doesn't why couldn't it? That would make the hash random, no?
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:06:50
Well, that's the question of the OP. Is there any protocol out there that implemented something like this..?
For instance you could prove that you are close to a certain location by receiving some data faster than other people.
There's no way to counterfeit that.
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:14:40
Thanks for the links! Cool ones.
@_date: 2019-07-12 12:12:43
The OP consists of a very clear question. Some people in this thread have actually helped me answer the question. Idk what is frustrating you, but go spit out somewhere else.
@_date: 2019-07-09 10:55:21
You're funny) The sea miners would be fun.
But I don't like the hubs or 3-4 big miners, any miner that wants to participate have to provide proof of location to be a valid miner.
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:10:14


Yes, I do think it possible because the speed of light is finite, and you can't cheat on that.
But I don't think the block would have to be on some small time scale. You could simply give a natural edge to miners that are closer to the satellite. Like they can mine a little before the others. And over the time, and as the satellite turns around Earth, it would distribute/give the edge everywhere it passes by. The incentive for natural spread out of miners would simply depend on the mechanism/the amount of edge you give to miners closer to the satellite.
I'm not sure network speeds have to come in play at all.
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:05:29
How can a fraudulent client "lie" about the checksum if the client cannot be tampered with or read? How can he know it?
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:17:24
Yes, I was also wondering the same. I think it's a problem but not a major issue, I guess you can always implement a new client backward compatible, no?
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:54:47
So be it, let the malicious ones lie, anyway it is easy to detect a wrong block. What would they win to constantly lie about a block, if it is easily checked?
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:35:30


I'm sure about that.
But what kind of wrong are difficult to detect?
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:19:38
I understand. For some reason I thought that through cryptographic tricks you could ensure that the client running on the machine that you want to transact with, is an untampered with clone of an original trustworthy software that would have been spread around in a P2P fashion.
But if that would be possible, we agree that no consensus algo would be needed and the decentralization a much easier and scalable business?
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:11:59
Alright, I guess that answers my question. Thanks
Yes, this Phonon network seems to be what I was thinking of, but it's not trustless. You trust the card issuer, the same way I think than you trust Ledger or Trezor to not steal you.
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:30:56


Exactly! Now you answer the OP's question: the point of POW is to avoid mass creation of nodes by an entity.
If it wouldn't be this sybil problem, POW would not be necessary and a simple random selection of nodes would suffice, right?
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:15:49
Ok, thanks.
Can you tell me more? Why is that not possible? Kinda like hardware wallet crypto works, they cannot be tampered or read, but they can validate transactions, right?
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:48:53
Ok, so there is also this issue of ordering that I didn't know, but then you could decide randomly who in the network is going to be the responsible for the next block. And if it does it wrong, it is corrected right away because it is easy to verify. I don't see in your explanation why POW specifically is needed.
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:06:21
Interesting... I'll think about it.
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:02:40
Yes, I've read several explanations
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:40:00
You mean without POW, the whole blockchain history could be tampered easily? Yes, but again, if this is easily verifiable, what is the point to do it?
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:59:37
Ok, I understand. Thx
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:04:55
Why not randomly? How does that necessitate POW?
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:59:55
Ok, I'll think about it.
Why would you want that? I say it in the post, because then you wouldn't need any consensus algorithm, but just simple P2P transactions, extremely fast and scalable.
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:10:49
The original software is simply the software that allows to operate a transaction between two users. Well, ok I think it's called a client.
How do you make a software that cannot be tampered or read? That's my actual question, at the end of the post. Is that possible?
