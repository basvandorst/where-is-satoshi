Ha. These images were taken by him, and uploaded with his permission. Do you require more proof? I can assure you, a lot more was lost than just BTC.
Do you not understand the point of the post?  Security is important.

The only thing left is a Data Recovery company. I'd say lost. Quite a few, too. He made a big call by investing a nice sum into BTC for his siblings and parents - then this happens.

This happened to a close friend of mine.
I've noticed a few redditors on question why people go to certain extremes for Bitcoin security. 
Well, here's why.

He bought them when BTC were hovering around the $29.00 AUD mark. Back then, the easiest way for Aussies to buy BTC was locally or via cash deposit. He did a cash deposit and unfortunately he lost the receipts in the blaze.
The last step is seeking assistance from a data recovery company.

Is there really any reason to jump to conclusion and say 'FAKE'?
I'm trying to let people know the importance of BTC security. 
You never know what could happen.

I understand everything you've just said - but their latest iOS version is a dream to use. You have to have an upgraded wallet though. 
@_date: 2016-05-16 05:10:38
What about for jailbroken iPhones?

Just downloaded the app. It's awesome!
Will be using this now to check the price.

Wow, lentil-soup, amazing.
Hardleft121, you are so generous.

Brilliant response. So true.
@_date: 2013-05-12 09:45:14
Yes you're right.
My bad - forgot the 's'!
@_date: 2013-02-21 03:01:45
You are very generous, hardleft121! :)

Depending on what country you are from, the easiest way to own bitcoins is to just buy them. MtGox is the largest exchange... I'm guessing most bitcoin users buy them from there. From what I know, it is almost impossible to purchase BTC with a credit card or PayPal because of potential chargebacks.
You can earn free bitcoins (well, in extremely small amounts) from various sites.
I use  because it links me to the legitimate websites.
Because I am from down under, I mostly purchase them using the cash deposit method at this website. 
Guys, if any of my information is indeed incorrect, don't hesitate to correct me. I am relatively new to the whole bitcoin craze. :)
Good Luck!

So the cops will help you out because you didn't receive money in your drug buying account?

If I were you I'd post this in @_date: 2013-05-27 03:03:04
Now they HAVE made dubstep? Not even going to bother arguing with someone who goes against his own words when it doesn't swing his way.
@_date: 2013-05-13 10:13:57
These blokes should cop a mouthful.

I don't know. Can you repeat the question?
@_date: 2013-05-26 14:59:23
How can you be a 'technical ass' if you don't know what you're talking about? Knife Party have made dubstep and drumstep.
"...Knife Party don't make dubstep..."
One of their most popular songs is dubstep. It's titled 'centipede'.
@_date: 2013-05-13 10:17:12
Mate, what rush seeing those numbers!
Keep me in mind too, my good sir. :3

Someone start a Melbourne one!

Ahhhh... You're great :) 
@_date: 2013-02-21 16:58:18
Although this is a great solution... let me tell you, that source code will never be read by my friend.
@_date: 2013-05-26 23:23:46
You just said 'Knife Party don't make dubstep'. Get your facts straight.
You're joking? No drumstep?
Go listen to Bonfire, and Nero - Crush on you (Knife Party remix).  
Oh no, I must be wrong because it doesn't say 'Knife Party's drumstep remix'.
