To be fair, a block size increase would have helped. I'm not saying that it's a solution but it definitely would have helped.

The same people used to champion "le reddit army". Now they find it cringe worthy. They'll move on from the doge meme as well.

Got it. Thanks for the reply.

Kodak thought that they where a film company when they should have realized that they where a company that sold memories.

Good video. But he should have mentioned BU given the current climate.

I understand the extra power but how would there be more forks? 
I'm not trying to be facetious or anything, I genuinely don't know. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:13:00
Yes, it is.

Yup, this has to stick!

I really like the discussion that goes on here. R/Bitcoin seems like Bitcoin for kids, half the sub is just memes and trash talk. 
R/Bitcoinmarkets is a refreshing read. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:27:26
Yeah, but why? Why not just let the block chain handle all transactions like it was originally intended to? 
@_date: 2016-01-16 15:06:23
How I've made money on Bitcoin:
Bitcoin is declared dead, the price drops, I buy a bunch of cheap Bitcoin. The price goes up...  Rinse and repeat.

Nope, just uniformed. I'm just Looking for some friendly answers. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:04:09
But why do we want off chain networks? We already have PayPal. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:35:29
Instead of drastically upping the block size, why can't blocks just be created more often. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 18:31:31
Yeah having PayPal ledger a bunch of transactions is a very centralized situation. Isn't that totally against the spirit of a decentralized currency? 
@_date: 2016-01-21 02:37:51
This is why

Is this something that would happen hundreds of times a day under these conditions or just something that would happen less than once a month.... If the latter is true, couldn't we just call it "luck of the draw" "tough shit for that particular miner" and continue on? 
I guess what I'm saying is that if an orphan block only happens rarely then is it really that big of a deal or are there other negative implications of this that I'm unaware of? 
@_date: 2016-06-11 16:52:45

The answer to "why?" is "because fuck you, that's why".

Really? I didn't know that. So let's say that it spend 2 Bitcoin... I have to add that 2 Bitcoins value to my taxes and pay the capital gains accordingly? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:21:31
I don't believe that you have to pay capital gains taxes until you sell your investment (Bitcoin) for your countries currency.

Definitely the best Bitcoin related subreddit. It doesn't have the stupid hodl meme bullshit.

It still won't stop steam from banning you after only getting a chance to play for a bit.... You'd get more game play from playing demo versions.

I got the same thing. I like the idea of eth but these messages are causing me to hate it. It really makes eth sound seedy and feel like a scam... It really makes eth seem illegitimate.

Don't buy when the price goes up and your all excited. Buy when the price goes down and you're pissed off.

But there is still the problem where the person who prints the money gets to steal value from everyone else holding the money by just printing more money. 
This also forces the users of money to use banks if they want to receive any interest. 
If you held onto a dime that bought you a chocolate bar in 1979 it won't buy you a chocolate bar in 2017.
@_date: 2017-06-20 00:37:07
It's not a waste if the money comes right back to you.

Very kind gesture indeed. We need more folk like this. It's deeds like this that will elevate the reputation of bitcoins to a point where grandma will even use them to buy yarn to nit a beautiful cardigan. Mmmmmm cardigans......
