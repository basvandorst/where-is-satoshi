The fact is there are many projects similar to bitcoin though 
So a 1.5 billion bitcoin market cap is a bit insane
Ebay and PayPal could use a bitcoin competitor rending bitcoins fairly obsolete in the mainstream 
Then bitcoin value would fall

1.5 billion market cap and the bitcoins themselves are near worthless. too many competitors to bitcoin. each bitcoin can be broken into 100 million units and exchanged that way. there is no peg. yet ppl are paying $140 a bitcoin. it is nuts
a few yrs ago they were 5 cents a bitcoin

The price of bitcoin has risen 10,000 fold. The market cap is 1.5 billion dollars. Most of that has to do with speculation. Is there even a 100 million of actual goods and purchases made with bitcoin a year now? Silk road does about 22 million.

In 2011, Paul Krugman, a Keynesian economist, reviewed bitcoin saying that "[bitcoin] has fluctuated sharply, but overall it has soared. So buying into [bitcoin] has, at least so far, been a good investment. But does that make the experiment a success? Um, no. What we want from a monetary system isn’t to make people holding money rich; we want it to facilitate transactions and make the economy as a whole rich. And that’s not at all what is happening in [bitcoin]."[17] In 2013, Krugman stated that unlike gold or paper fiat currencies, bitcoin derives its value solely from a self-fulfilling expectation that others will accept it as payment.[131] He also stated that it is unnecessarily wasteful to consume real resources, such as electric power, on the creation of bitcoins

more or less bitcoin is a way to store fiat currency in a commodity. the fact it has gone up in value ten thousand fold or whatever is strange in a way. i mean you could just buy gold or silver rather than bitcoin if you wanted a commodity. both silver and gold have a much longer track record. I imagine ppl in Cyprus could just start trading survival silver until things stabilized

The thing about bitcoin is there are only 50,000 transactions a day with it. How many do you think they are with yen, euro, usd, yuan, etc per day? There is also no government holding gold at central banks with bitcoin. The full faith and credit of bitcoin is youtube comments. If there were some kind of bitcoin run there would be no mechanisms in place to soften the blow. Bitcoin if it were to become popular could just trade down to it lowest unit to match whatever value a US cent was at and the money of bitcoin would be larger the world GDP. There are all sorts of inflation and deflation scenarios with bitcoin. All sorts of scenarios whereby it ends up an internet fad and the value goes back to near worthless too

mt gox wont even let you trade with dwolla unless you get verified by faxing your ID and a recent utility bill. Even then ppl arent getting approved

Market cap is still 1.5 billion. BTC/USD is up what, 14 fold since the start of the year?  There are only 50,000 bitcoin transactions a day. Bitcoins can be broken down into so many micro units there is nothing to say the value of a bitcoin could not shift dramatically over time. There is no pegging mechanism and no intrinsic value beyond being an anonymous irreversible means of exchange. There are also other cryptocurrencies out there too.

Gold has actual use in jewelry and industry. If litecoin or something other than bitcoin becomes the de facto internet standard then what will a bitcoin be worth? 
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:48:57
Gold has uses in dentistry, industry, and as jewelry. Unless you increase the supply dramatically by finding a way to pull it out of sea water cheaply it will have significant value. 
Bitcoin has pros and cons. The anonymous nature of it means you could hire a hitman with it. I mean it is still traceable, just more difficult. 
I agree the mining complaint is a bit silly, at least for now. When the difficulty rises super high though maybe it is more problematic

Explain to me how I am wrong. Explain how a Nobel Prize winning economist, Paul Krugman, is wrong as well on bitcoins. That would be more intelligent than downvoting me

There are digital ways to buy and trade small amounts of silver contracts. At least they are tied to something that has tangible use in jewelry and industry. The rapid price fluctuations of bitcoins alone make pricing real goods and services against them harder as well.

cash has storage costs as well, both sit in a vault in their physical form. stock certificates have storage costs too. running a server at an online bank to store electronic fiat dollars has costs too.
