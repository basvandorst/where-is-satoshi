Those "minor fluctuations" make bitcoin completely unusable as an actual currency. If I'm a consumer, there's no way I'd be willing to get paid in a currency whose value might drop and leave me unable to pay for food. If I'm getting a loan, there's no way I'm borrowing in a currency whose value might double, leaving me in twice as much debt as before. Stable rates of change are an essential part of being a good store of value and medium of exchange.

Yep. It's not just misunderstanding of basic economics, it's misunderstanding of basic *finance*. We've got people who apparently think the primary method of saving is to put cash in a bank account, and that currency speculation is the same thing as investment savings.

If inflation is constant, low, and positive, holding money in cash is low-risk but undesirable, since you'll steadily be loosing a little bit of value every year. So people are incentivized to have a bit of cash assets but either invest or spend most of their earnings, both of which stimulate the economy. If inflation is zero or negative, it becomes a good idea to store lots of money as cash, since you're guaranteed returns, and spending money on nonessential goods is a bad idea, since you'll have more purchasing power tomorrow. This slows down the economy and hurts growth.

No, the economy does not grow from people saving in the form of cash. The economy grows from people saving money in the form of *investments*.

Safe != good. The 30 year return of gold is just over 300%, a 3% per year return rate. That's *terrible*- it's about the same as the long-term inflation rate. If you had put the same amount of money into the market and reinvested all dividends, over the same time period you would average about 9% returns. That's a difference of 6 percentage points per year, which works out to *five times* as big a return over 30 years. Putting money into gold as an investment is one of the *worst* things you can do with your money. Yeah, financially illiterate people are comfortable with it, because they're idiots.

And in fact, this is exactly why a steady low level of inflation is good for the economy. If inflation is zero or negative, people save money as cash instead of investing it. If inflation is above zero, people are incentivized to minimize their cash savings, and put their money into growing the economy. It's fun to see a chart showing how the value of bitcoin has increased, but deflationary currencies are very bad.

Right, the Fed was around but had less control over inflation and the value of the dollar. Actually, the end of the gold standard was done less for long-term reasons and more in response to a short term crisis- the US had less gold reserves than the amount of dollars in foreign banks. There was a real worry that banks around the world would exchange their dollars for gold, and that the US would run out of gold to repay it with, crashing the US dollar. In order to avoid this, the US simply dropped the gold standard, avoiding the sort of currency crash that occurred in Britain in the 90s.

We would be in a bad place if we still used gold. The pre-fed economy was defined not only by cyclic crisis, but also by massive inflation and deflation. There would be years of 30% inflation, followed by years of 30% deflation. There would be multiple consecutive years of double digit inflation. It was really bad for economic growth, since investment was a lot more risky.
After the Fed was established things calmed down a little, but the fed's ability to control inflation was still limited. That was one of the factors that led to the Great Depression being so bad- the Fed had limited flexibility in responding to the crisis. Abandoning the gold standard was one of the best economic decisions ever made for the US.

[Here's a chart of historical inflation rates]( I misremembered the numbers- there were a few 30% inflation years, but no 30% deflation years.
