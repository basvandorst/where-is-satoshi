I guess the important question is: Do you ever think about the BTC price while making love to your wife??

Thanks for all the comments. I admire the long term holders and the people who fervently believe in the technology as a viable currency. 
For the investors I guess its a possibility that it’s actually your children (or their children) who will reap the financial reward of your foresight. 
I just can’t shake the feeling that right now, while you all have noble aspirations, there are an elite few - possibly individuals of pre existing high net worth and/or large organisations - sitting out there who are making a huge amount of money off short term volatility.

Cheers, Just to repeat I have no affiliation, love or backing of Monero. Only used it as an example as it just happens to be the only crypto I have used for a real-world purchase and - I am fairly certain it will not be the coin to emerge as champion.

Yes, you are 100% right I did use bitcoin as a step to purchasing Minero. I do not view Monero as the ”breakout” crypto in any way, it's just what the particular vendor accepted at the time. Any comment on the other points? Cheers.

Turtlecoin! 
I’m joking :)

Very funny.....you do realise that somebody could actually take this comment at face value right :)
@_date: 2019-07-01 11:04:57
Thank you for all your answers so far. Very helpful! Something nobody has really touched on - is it true that a small number of individuals/organizations own most of the BTC in circulation? Doesn't this mean they can manipulate the markets? Apologies if I'm grossly oversimplifying the situation.
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:28:01
Can you please give some examples of the normal things and vendors you are spending it on/with daily?
@_date: 2018-11-22 10:29:22
Does anyone have an idea on what daily, normal things bitcoin can be used for? If you could list specific examples that would be great.

I’m a bit confused. If you really really want a new laptop from Lenovo, can’t you just buy it with $. ?

I disagree. I think people are just trying to give friendly advice on safe practices when handling cryptos. They are doing it out of community spirit, nothing more than that. 
Cryptos are very easy to steal compared to money held in a traditional bank. A lot of people don’t understand this and many many people have had cryptos stolen. OP has *specifically* stated he is holding $32K somewhere on a computer/wallet in his possession - it’s different to saying “I’m holding” because now someone knows it’s worth their time and effort to try and steal from you. Like a mugger targeting someone with an obviously visible Rolex. 
Like I said, don’t believe the post anyway.

Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell was an excellent read.

I’ve been to that mall. So dark. So cold. A strong smell of urine. So many cobwebs on the kiosk.  Is that homeless person asleep or are they watching my transaction??
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:51:42
The most worrying thing about this post by a long long way, is the amount of people who have absolutely no idea why you shouldn’t post you’re holding 10 BTC on the Internet. Jesus wept. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:24:40
When you were diligently researching about BTC hopefully you read the key part regarding only investing an amount you’re prepared to lose. I only mention it as your post doesn’t really come across like that. 
God speed to you!
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:08:08

You can trust me my friend. I will send you a program called frendship.exe to cement our new bond  (ps: it flags as crypto malware but this is a false flag)

First hit on google would have confirmed to you that it’s not anonymous “by default”.
“Bitcoin is not anonymous, but, rather, pseudo-anonymous. By now, most Bitcoin veterans know this. It’s less obvious to many, however, why Bitcoin is not really anonymous by default, and what can be done to de-anonymize Bitcoin users” 
@_date: 2018-12-15 16:17:19
1) if you hold bitcoin you’re in charge of your security, not a bank, when they are gone they are gone. The posters are giving friendly advice for OP to be secure. You need to be secure on your computer and secure in the real (physical world) eg: shouting about owning 10 bitcoins in a bar is not a great idea. 
2) majority of purchased bitcoins are not anonymous “by default” straight out of the box, you need to follow an additional set of steps to anonymise your transaction - a little bit like money laundering. There are a few ways to obtain anonymously. Just read up on it. Hell there’s a whole reddit forum dedicated to it if you’re interested. Someone demanding a ransom would have to carefully follow extra security steps not to be traced when they turn BTC into cash - it’s not automatically built into bitcoin for you. There are several reports bitcoin use is on the wane on the dark web and people are turning to other cryptos. No idea how true this is as I’m not an expert - I have certainly seen markets using Monero though. 
A lot of the loss of anonymity has come through attempts to regulate crypto. In the old days you could just buy some without proving who you are now most places perform KYC checks on you before you open an account - so in a way the banks/authorities have eroded a lot of the BTC anonymity. 
I’ll be honest, OPs post sounds like a croc anyway. Doesn’t ring true at all. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:24:16
It’s not freaking anonymous and anyone who tells you it is is a simpleton. 
Use Monero for ransom demands in the future.
