1 - This is the first I have heard of Femen.
2 - 'good' connection? Bitcoin is currency and could be used at many different places to purchase tshirts and coffee cups. From their website, the activism itself is spontaneous and creative, requiring little or no funding.
I dont quite see your point in your edit- a bit misogynistic? like shoving banknotes down a stripper's g-string.
I have ordered a tshirt (in fiat)
Patriarcy has failed and, Dekker3d, female anger is vital to the survival of our species. (or any species- the mother defending her young.) However, it is not a simple role-reversal that is required...women behaving like men will not work.
also have people read any Audre Lorde?
PS, I am a man.

Sorry, I missed the terms and conditions that exclude any critique here. At least provides some healthy (and necessary) cynicism.
On a serious note, humanity is fucked unless we deal with this rift between genders. Bitcoin alone will not save us.
BTW I do have bitcoin, and no, I didn't get goxxed.

I was awake for 2 weeks straight after I read [this]( three months later, there's still not enough hours in the day!
edit: Just installed [F.lux]( "makes the color of your computer's display adapt to the time of day" -such innovation.
Thankyou, I will donate to *CSD-N* what I can

From Sotoshi's whitepaper: 


allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other **without the need for a trusted
third party**.....
Using Bitcoin requires you to learn about cryptography, computer security, also to learn the responsibilty *to be your own bank*.
Or you could just trust Supernintendo Slawski and his criminal friends on Wall Street and Corp. of London to 'look after' your wealth for you.
edit: excuse my sarcasm, but start with the whitepaper and the [wiki](

I don't doubt that. I'm addressing the misogyny coming from this circlejerk subreddit and a general perception towards women formed from consumption of porn, which dissociates from sensation and feelings in the real world.
edit: lol I was made redundant from healthcare lol..

Upon reflection, privacy/anonymity, the *actual* Nakamoto:
**"**  10. Privacy.
The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method, **but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous.** The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone....**"**
Of course, an ongoing issue in this, the original Beta Version of cryptocurrency...
Edit: Andreas?.....lol Like I said, *no one else* can be your saviour- you gotta save yourself.
respect to AMA though

Got one from I replied:
"Cool man, I just need to confirm that: 1AD8giCqAWK3q6KzatQkDz7k62NipNo7qm is controlled by you. In all this deregulated excitment there are all manner of scams going on, as you probably know. Please sign a message back to this reddit account. Regards"
Should've asked him to sign the message "This is not a scam. I Like BIg Butts" haha
