Ah, but they are [legally accountable]( BFL was required to have a reasonable basis for what they said their shipping dates were. Once they knew they weren't going to make the estimated ship date for a given order, they were required to contact the buyer, say what the new shipping date was, and ask if he wanted to cancel and get a full refund. 
If the new date is more than 30 days later, the buyer would have to actually opt out of just getting a refund. If they didn't have a new date, the FTC treats it as "original date + 30 days until automatic refund." Either way, the buyer could cancel up until the order was *actually shipped*. 
But all of that only applies if you tell the buyer *before* your estimated shipping date. If you just blow past it (like BFL did), the order is automatically cancelled and full refunds are due within a week. And then telling customers that they couldn't cancel their orders? Yeah, that shit don't fly. 
Amazon doesn't tell you about shipping delays because they're being nice, they tell you about delays because otherwise the federales will get annoyed.

Yes, exactly, you shouldn't use bitcoins to buy anything. You are correct. Actually, you should just GTFO of that market entirely. 
As for what bitcoin was meant to be used for, fleecing people who don't know how money or trade works is exactly what bitcoin is for.
