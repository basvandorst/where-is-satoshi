at 90,000 you would be using the 1.5" cable, which has a breaking strength of about 180,000 labs, with a SF of 2.

Aight so lets ballpark some numbers shall we? Lets assume a max load of a 300 pound person (although compared to the weight of the cable its not much). Judging by the cable that looks like 1" steel cable. Fastest number I found is 1.85 pounds per foot. At 1200 meters, or 3937 feet that is 7283 pounds. We will approximate these loads combined on the cable at the midpoint, totaling 7583 pounds. 1" steel rope has a safe working load of 16700 pounds. However this is Mexico, so lets say they have a working load of 20,000 pounds (there is little load fluctuation so this is actually not as bad as it sounds, plus the breaking load is over 80,000 lbs, still leaving a safety factor of 4) This leaves remaining tension at about 12,000 pounds. For another approximation, the sag this line had will be high too. With these ballparked numbers the angle between the midpoint horizontal and top anchor would be 30 degrees. This is reduced somewhat by having the setup overall at an angle so the person goes downhill the whole time. If we wanted an average angle of 10 degrees for instance, the line would need to have about 43,671 lbs of load. Now this is really close to the braking strength of the wire and the cable would absolutely creep (slowly deform over time) at this load. A fatter cable could be used, like 1.5 inch. To get a 10 degree average slope with 1.5" cable (4.16 lbs/ft) you would need 96,000 pounds of tension. Either way, these numbers are crazy.
Just a ramble into what the forces might actually looks like. tl:dr somewhere between 30,000 to 90,000 lbs of tension, depending on angle and cable thickness.
