A market cap of 279B doesn't mean there is 279b available in bitcoin. It's just the price multiplied by the quantity of coins. Not everybody (in fact almost none of the total population of holders) paid in at today's price, they almost all paid in lower, and miners didn't invest directly at all rather paid in hardware and electricity costs. 
If 10mn people moved a total of 1bn out of btc at once you'd see a movement far greater than just going down to a cap of 278bn.

You only pay capital gains on your gains though. So it'd get you either way.
Having said that, borrowing on a card against something as volatile as bitcoin is absolutely insane.

How much do you lose to transaction fees on average would you say using this method?

I think the main problem here is that either the giver or receiver would need to plan for unknown fluctuations in the currency. Do you say "I'll give you 10btc a month" or "I'll give you the value of $100k/month in btc"?
Depending on which way the currency swings and how much it swings by over the course of a year that could cost either  the giver or receiver an order of magnitude of the initial donation.

Fiat literally means "money backed solely by a government decree". The term exists specifically for currencies that aren't backed by gold or another tangible item. 
"Commodity currency" is the term for a currency backed by anything tangible.

You need to move them to your personal wallet after purchasing them in an exchange.
Exchanges aren't underwritten, so if they collapse - for example if they were fractional reserve selling and there's a run on the bank - you'd be unable to access your funds.

So the thinking for a middle class Mexican here would need to be "my currency lost 20%, I should definitely move all of my money into this other currency that lost 20% of its value at the same time".

Even if the article had presented proof (which it didn't) then no, bitcoin isn't regulated, so there's jo legal wrongdoing here.

Things like the tipping bots don't really work with bitcoin either. No one wants to tip someone a dollar for a comment if it's going to cost them a further 5-10 dollars for the transaction.

Bitcoin cash split from the bitcoin chain, so all historical transactions and wallets are valid in both btc and bch. There's parity between your two wallets. Any transactions after the split are only valid on the chain they're made on though.
If you had 5btc before the split, you then had 5btc and 5bch. If you then bought an extra 3btc after the split you'll have 8btc and 5bch still (only the btc chain increased, not the bch chain).
This is only the case if:
- You already had btc before the split
- you had your btc in a wallet that you own (exchange wallets only count if the exchange allows it)
- you have access to the private keys for your wallet

It's always reasonable to ask for sources and citation. A good balanced breakdown of the claims are made by the BBC's fact checking team. It suggests that the figures you see on twitter are a bit higher than reality, but that bitcoin *does* consume an absolutely enormous amount of electricity, for a relatively small number of transactions processed. 
Even at the lower estimates its is an absolutely staggeringly high slice of global energy consumption pie, and it's concerning that it's being brushed to the side by key figures in the currency's space.

That's pretty idealistic. If you want to change get a line of code to fix a bug, grand. Get in there and get coding!

That's not really true. Blockchain technology is agnostic to centralisation. It's applications so far have mainly been for decentralisation.

Issuing bonds is a different process to printing money. It's like borrowing from the past VS borrowing from the future.Printing money directly reduces the value of each dollar in existence immediately - borrowing a tiny amount from each previously issued dollar's value (from the historic strength of your currency) . Issuing bonds borrows a large amount of money from a small group of very wealthy entities and releases that to the general circulation, also reduces the value of each dollar currently circulating, but less than printing money, and it's backed by a promise to repay, there is a (sort of) tangible asset behind a bond which acts as a counterweight to the devaluing of the currency.

Except you don't have a clue what the cost of trading your bitcoin will be at tax time. If everyone moved to btc suddenly then there will be a lot of competition to get in the ledger, massively increasing transaction costs, while the value of the currency you're converting to/from is tanking, this would become a huge overhead when the tax year ends.

Nobody should put all their cash into bitcoin full stop. Putting everything in one place is a massive risk even if its got a lot of stability. Putting it all into something that fluctuates as much as btc is nothing if not insanely reckless with your finances.

I think most thresholds would be personal anyway. It's not going to be "I'll sell all at 100k" it's "I'll sell all when *I* have 100k"

It crashed below that in September 
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:41:31
A few years back I bought 10 at around $30 a piece. Minutes later it starts falling. I think that crash ended at less than a dollar. It was devastating, that wasnt my "last 300" or anything but I was a low earner at the time and that was more than a weeks wages before bills ans rent. I'd need saving for a bit, watching the price soar.
That time I swore never to buy into anything so silly again. Took the price a while to recover and I eventually forgot about my btc. Found them on my windows visa install a few months back, so that was nice.

Not really for 2 reasons:
1) if the btc market crashes, you can't live in your bitcoin, if the housing market crashes at very least you have a house to live in 
2) Depends where you are in the world. Houses are taxed differently to other commodities in various countries and you'd be hard pushed to find somewhere that taxed house ownership more than an investment portfolio. House values increases very quickly in most places where you might reasonably put $300k into a building. You'd need to make the assessment for the rise in value of your house, take the interest in the loan, take the tax on your bitcoin gains vs the tax on home ownership before you could say if it's even a net benefit. Even if it was "wiser" isn't necessarily the correct way to describe putting all your liquidity in one asset.
"safe as houses" is a saying for a reason. It's safe money because even in the worst case if you lose your money you still have a tangible commodity that will become valuable again eventually.

The newest episode has a review of the SUV tesla. They also address why they haven't reviewed any Tesla cars for nearly a decade now.
In a nutshell he says "being sued is a hassle/stress, so I just decided I would never review a tesla again" then one of the others said "but it looks like Tesla are in the brink of becoming a major manufacturer so we have to start reviewing them" 
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:18:13
Top gear shit on the car because they're a car review show, and the tesla at the time was a really very crap vehicle. It was expensive, had a relatively short range, the interior was (actually still is) nothing short of gaudy, and the exterior is an acquired taste.
Top gear was fairly forward looking when it came to eco cars, but they always said they wouldn't just give a positive review to a brand because it has a battery.

From top to bottom this is nonsense.
The concept of blockchain is a system that proves immutable proof of input. That's it.
Immutable proof of input happens to be hella useful if you're making a currency, but it's also really useful for loads of other things. Such as government record keeping for example. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:04:25
Or they rightly factor in non-financial aspects into determining opportunity cost. Most people can't watch a given market with enough frequency to get considerable gains from those opportunities for whatever reason (full time jobs, kids, families). 
Of the people who can dedicate the time and resources to monitoring markets are too overwhelmed to take informed actions based on fluctuations.
So its totally reasonable for an average Joe to just not factor opportunity costs at all, as they simply don't apply to them. Certainly opportunities are being missed by most people, but they were never opportunities that the vast majority of people ever had a chance of making money on anyway.
