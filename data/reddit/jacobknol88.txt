what is the highest price one btc could possibly ever go?
@_date: 2019-07-30 09:37:53
fak, you're smart....That's some high class analysis  right there XD
@_date: 2019-07-14 07:53:22
aih, fair point then I guess. Enjoy your coffee and sunday mate :)
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:43:01
makes no sense. Libra is a stable coin. I don't see how it will explode price-wise, other than explotion in adoption
@_date: 2019-07-17 10:41:10
so, what will our next bottom be?
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:13:17
oke true, i am persuaded
@_date: 2019-07-22 16:30:40
Ah thanks, for the reply.  In my question, I was actually refering to the 10mln $ btc endgame documentary. Which sounds insane, at first. But if you put the pieces together it might make sense after all. Timeline is unclear though.
@_date: 2019-07-22 19:24:06
Cill out Butters. Jesus, no more coffee for you. It will happen when it happens. We have been waiting for this for over a year now, with delays. I think we can survive another 24/48/72 hours.
@_date: 2019-07-25 15:01:30
no not really. I was just curious about an update
@_date: 2019-07-09 07:51:03
Anyone read the news about the German bank and the 18.000 people they are going to fire? 
I guess this is good news for the international payment industry, where the furure of crypto is. This literaly means their Business model is overdue
@_date: 2019-07-25 09:28:59
anyone has an update about BAKKT? Are they still test running?
@_date: 2019-07-08 18:02:18

Will the MT.Gox situation make the crypto market plummet again? thoughts, anyone? 
@_date: 2019-03-26 14:35:07
ah thanks. what is your estimation? 
@_date: 2019-03-25 12:39:57
thanks for the explaination! 
@_date: 2019-11-07 16:02:39
Price looks a bit stagnant these last couple of days. I wonder when the bulls will get exhausted
@_date: 2019-03-25 11:35:01
forgive me my stupidity, but what do you mean by that? 
@_date: 2019-03-26 13:39:14
sooo...is crypto(btc) allowed now in India? dead-line has passed right? 
@_date: 2019-11-02 23:26:08
did you insert the correct address? ��
@_date: 2019-08-06 08:18:03
ik bakkt launches soon a 15x from this point isn't that strange if only 5% of the money from the stock market flows into btc
@_date: 2019-10-31 18:56:43
would say, more shark like
@_date: 2019-10-04 07:44:35
use bitstamp or kraken instead. f@ them

lol, coinbase fees. what a retards
@_date: 2019-10-28 19:29:38
Anyone has an update on this? I happen to be Dutch too
@_date: 2019-08-19 15:00:52
Apparently a bankrun in going on in HongKong. Will this affect btc? anyone?
@_date: 2019-10-27 12:56:48
Exactly ��
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:13:10
agree, dom t sell before 90k
@_date: 2019-06-16 08:34:34
will we gently kiss 10k today? only 700 bucks away from it
@_date: 2019-02-25 18:08:00
that is not a source nor a link, but an opinion
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:18:54
i m not going to sell my btc's before we hit the 1mln mark anyway :)
@_date: 2019-02-24 14:38:57
That are some powerfull words

@_date: 2019-02-14 08:55:05
has anyone noticed btc 24hrs volume is around 14b? isn't this extremely high?
@_date: 2019-10-27 07:17:53
Clock goes back one hour today guys. More time to stack sats
@_date: 2019-10-27 16:43:16
Yes I am the Btc timetraveler and i'm sending this message from the citadel, obviously.
@_date: 2019-06-15 19:38:07
serious question: I saw a btc documentary the other say and the conclusion of that video was that one btc could hit a value 10mln one day at the endgame. 
thoughts anyone?
@_date: 2019-02-16 09:12:26
thanks for your anwser :) upvote for you sir +1
@_date: 2019-02-26 20:02:08
But why America? why? As an European I just fail to understand the motivations of us gov...and the SEC. 
I mean, embrase it and the money is there to be made
@_date: 2019-10-26 18:37:36
Mr. Smith knows
@_date: 2019-06-04 17:50:15
based on resistance?
@_date: 2019-06-15 18:55:41
I m in favor for this
@_date: 2019-06-04 17:51:25
I asked that because I was looking at that too. I don t think we can maintain 7.5k to be honest
@_date: 2019-06-12 18:51:20
Exactly. what a lot op people tend to forget is that  btc made if from .01 cent to 20k on mainly retail-investors alone. Now the infrastructure is being laid for institutional/private investors. These people/institutions don't invest with 10,20,30,40 of 50k, but with 10,20,30,40,50 mln and beyond. This effect will cause btc,eth,xrp(hate it or not), etc. to make way bigger jumps than before. So no, I don't think a 1mln btc is impossible, looking at what is going on behind the scenes.
@_date: 2019-02-27 12:14:21
well  forth place for us Dutchies, not so bad given the size of our country

@_date: 2019-06-16 08:42:44
I always hate that term "regulators" makes it sound like they're here to protect and serve us. While all they try to do is keep us poor and stupid and try to tax us again on our already nett earned money. Regulators...
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:45:32
that may actually be very true hmm
@_date: 2019-02-25 16:39:41

serious question: Will Libra coin affect btc in a negative way? anyone?
@_date: 2019-06-14 22:39:18
i get this "over 9000" reference
@_date: 2019-06-19 20:12:14
thanks for youe comperhansive anwser mate, much appriciated. I was sort of thinking in the same line as this. The proplem with this thought i encounterd is:
In general people are stupid. "oew look, I can send you money now -to instagram friend" 
Also, Fb appears to have a pretty strong foothold in India as well. In addition to that, Africa is also about gain internet access for the unbanked. 
In summary, these are about 2bln(if not more) uneducated people getting financial access for the first time. I think their major concern will be if they can buy food with "internet money"  and not decentralization. 
I completely feel your point. and I wouldn't want to touch libra. But i fear the majority of the people dom t care, hence my concerns.
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:08:07
that made me laugh. upvote for you sir

Very good answer. Btc isn't made as a tool for Socialism. People who believe that are delusional
@_date: 2019-01-06 20:48:16
Nothing to see here guys, it's just another pump so people will fomo in the market. Then the OTC buys will sell on exchanges and btc drops again and will be bought back cheaper later on again.  
Nothing serious will happen and will continue like this before we have more SEC clairity. Like it or not. I don't like it either, trust me. But this isn't in our hands anymore. 
Btc still hasn't bottomed out yet. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:54:44
So buddy, how is your break-out going so far? It did apprear your "TA mister know it all" analysis didn't held a lot of support. Told you so. Nothing will happen untill big money makes btc move
@_date: 2019-01-06 21:04:01
You have to help me out there buddy, english isn't my first language. I couldn't made any sense of your last sentence.
BTC has no fundament for this "break-out". I like to see btc hit 150k too, but the time isn't there yet. besides, when btc attempts to break out the selling pressure increases dramatically. 
That's why all of the last "break-outs" were never higer then c.a. 10%/15%. Us, retail investors can't compete with the sell pressure anymore, unless a price rise is orchestrated. At this moment the price is more likely to drop in order to bottom out, then to rise. You can downvote me for being honest.
But I guess we will see the upcoming days :) 
@_date: 2019-09-23 08:25:32
Here come the shorts!
@_date: 2019-09-25 19:13:23
anyone has today's Bakkt stats?
@_date: 2019-09-22 19:46:26
ow cool, didn't know that. I m actually in GMT +1 region

I feel like the Saudi Arabia attack might be a catalyst for an invation of Iran
@_date: 2019-09-24 08:54:20
Anyone has up to date Bakkt futures data?
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:01:02
oke, bitcoin, you can stop now, you had your fun. We get the point
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:09:58
how is it possible that the volume went from 17b to 20b and the price is still dropping?
@_date: 2019-09-02 12:51:21
Volume is rising, could this be the run-up to and for BAKKT?
@_date: 2019-09-05 09:37:04
that s a strong word you re using there mate, what makes you so sure? 
Because if we continue on this train of thoughts: if 100k is inevitable, a milli would also not be impossible
@_date: 2019-09-23 05:54:45
Here come the big shorts!
@_date: 2019-09-11 14:51:54
Happy 11th of september everyone!
@_date: 2019-09-09 07:51:39
I like your positive mind-set, but with so much money entering the market they could also short btc's price in a massive way
@_date: 2019-09-25 19:19:11

well oke, gold market is around 8-15 Trillion right? I guess based on that alone, It should make sense then. All though, I don't think the entire gold market will rush to Btc, to be honest
@_date: 2019-09-06 07:19:20
@_date: 2019-09-09 10:58:47
@_date: 2019-09-16 14:10:27
I agree with you on that one mate.
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:04:56
I actually agree. Better this by a factor 1 or 2 per day then an explosion at once, which would also greate big dips
@_date: 2019-09-13 12:38:53
lol, that escalated quickly
@_date: 2019-09-02 13:23:52
same here. Actually, a lot of people are speculating that the launch of Bakkt would create a price-drop, rather then a price-rise. 
But I am not so sure, because Bakkt will not be USD settled but with btc, which creates even more scarcity for btc. 
Personally, I would just buy and not try to time the market.
Just my two Satoshi's :)
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:18:50
lol, yes because everyone is shorting like crazy
@_date: 2019-09-30 08:35:06
My TA tells me we will probally bottom-out somewhere in the 6000-6500-6700 region. Just my two sats. Do with it as you will, just for sharing
@_date: 2019-09-05 08:39:48
so basically, a 100k bitcoin is possible?
@_date: 2019-09-05 10:25:58
That s absolutely true, I guess. Profit is profit.  That being said, I do believe that the current gold investors are not millenials, but maybe their offspring will take a deeper look into it. I know I surely would. This year alone, we already made over 300% profit. 
Cheers mate!
@_date: 2019-09-13 08:24:05
I don't understand why everyone is so obsessed with the price. We'll get there one way or another, just sit back, relax and enjoy the ride. Don't forget we're up +- 300% already.
@_date: 2019-09-22 19:42:26
less then 20 hours away from the incomming shorts from BAKKT
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:17:48
so this day end3d with +- 62 contracts. roughly $500k on the first day. Spounds more like a trail amount
@_date: 2019-09-09 07:03:24
The question of the day is: Could Bakkt result in a double edged sword?
