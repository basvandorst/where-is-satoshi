Nobody misunderstands regulation like the government does.  The founding fathers' intent was to use the government to REMOVE ROADBLOCKS, ensuring that state sovereignty doesn't interfere with the transacting of business.  Nowadays, the definition of regulation is to run every transaction through as many toll booths as possible.  They should stop pretending to regulate and properly call it 'restriction' or 'impedance' or just taxing for the sake of fattening their wallets.

Wouldn't some sort of bitcoin graphic look nice on your album art? Here's a couple of bucks.  :) @_date: 2014-05-26 17:00:06
There are roughly 7,235,846,400 people on the planet right now and 12.8 million bitcoins in circulation.  One person's fair share of bitcoins is 0.00176897. One bitcoin is 565.3005 people's fair share.  Since the usd price of bitcoin is 582 at this moment, you can buy another human's share of this stuff for about a dollar. How many times in a lifetime should one expect to be able to trade a dollar for a fair chance at an average fortune?  Here's a fortune on me 1768 bits

Mt. Gox sells a bitcoin on another exchange for 600.  Then they take the cash and buy two (desperate) customers' bitcoins at 250 each.  Mt. Gox nets $100 and reduces their bitcoin deficit by one.  Repeat until solvent or wise guys catch up with them. The only arbitrage is if you're Mark Karpeles.

Everyone who has a Knc product has a case similar to mine:
I buy a product and a promise not to compete for ~$10,000.
I get a product that barely pays for itself and KNC, well, look at the picture.  KNC applies the absolute most dishonest and illegal tactics possible to buy over 10x the chips they sold me and creating a farm WITH MY MONEY to dwarf whatever mining ability I purchased.  A 'legal' company would have 'danced with the one that brung em' and lived up to their promises, selling all the equipments that you see to the investors and simply rolled in profit from EQUIPMENT SALES!  
The management should be removed and jailed. Inventory and mining profit should be distributed to the investors.

Bitcoin should........                 Be all it can be!
We smallest miners have already been forced out by the large farms.  Miners pay MUCH TOO BIG A ROLE.  It doesn't take half the energy of the planet to secure the blockchain. Big mining farms are BIG BUSINESS and the enemy of the little guy.  
Scale at will!  Thinning the mining herd is a good thing.
@_date: 2015-08-26 13:54:09
How so?
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:02:45
I want a system that won't gag or require adjustments if and when a tidal wave of acceptance occurs.  I'm not concerned at all if mining conglomerates like KNC can no longer afford to keep me out of the mining business using money that they stole from me.

The future belongs to the efficient.  That's why Bitcoin is the future of money and efficient miners are the future of Bitcoin mining.  Governing volume is no way to run a railroad (or cyber currency).

If raising the block size limit does effect an increase in Bitcoin usage, BIP 100 will leave us right back here arguing over the merits of increasing it beyond 32MB.  Bitcoin's future is much much bigger than just 32x its present volume.  BIP 101 allows the blockchain to approach its potential.

Raise the rate for dust transactions. Anything under a penny costs a nickel to record.

The electrical cost of all those miners is a ridiculous waste of energy.  
*A handful of miners is all it takes.  
*At some point (now, for instance), too many miners can be overkill. 
*The electrical cost of all those miners is a ridiculous waste of energy. 
*That's kind of a sore subject with me because KNC and those like them would not be where they are without taking my money under criminally false pretenses. 
*The pools will certainly mine against the longest chain.

The future belongs to the efficient.  Bitcoin represents the theoretical limit of simplicity.  Add enough bells and whistles and you open the door for better mousetraps, paralysis by analysis and suddenly bitcoin is an altcoin. &lt;b&gt;Bloat Kills&lt;/b&gt;.

Your'e right!  I did forget that I was being trolled. I asserted that holders of coins have a say in this matter but you attempted to divert the argument away from said point.  My coins and the blockchain will be intact long after everyone on the roundtable has come and gone (and they will all go).

I don't do business with any of you.  Actual  bitcoin holders are noticeably missing from your consensus?

It's easy for you to blast the other side because any post (and poster) that defends it with facts is immediately dropped and banned.  There is no fear mongering over there.  They are decent people just like us who don't want Bitcoin to become just another subsidiary of something like AXA or worse.

That's absurd.  Why would they pour millions of dollars into their effort if they didn't have substantial skin in the game?

They should just box up all the parts, throw in some foam peanuts, and ship them.  The high speed manufacturing is undoubtedly done, and they're wasting about a million bucks a day doing assembly and crappy packing.
