I think everything associated with ur seed is stored on the blockchain. So when you use ur seed words and the ledger  access the blockchain it should pull it up.

Didn't like the IRS part smh

Just wait it out, it could a hour maybe less maybe more. I recently transferred some btc to bittrex it took almost 2 hours. It all depends on what they are fixing and how many people trying to make withdrawals.

Ur welcome
 Whatever question you have just type it in the YouTube search
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:33:10
Start with coinbase and get urself familiar with it. Then this video will help learn how to avoid the fees everyone is talking about. 
After you get comfortable open a Bittrex account if you want to start buying altcoins. Just watch a lot of YouTube videos. Whatever question you have type into the YouTube search and I'm 98% sure a video will pop up regarding the subject.

Did you consider getting a ledger nano 8k is a lot to keep on an exchange
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:19:42
Lmao ����������
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:30:40
You should be fine. Yesterday I transfered btc from Gdax to my ledger nano while service was degraded. It actually didn't take long for the transfer to go through. It just took awhile for it to be confirmed once it reached the nano wallet. Plus you can always track the withdrawal in Gdax.
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:30:12
Oh damn sorry to hear that.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:13:26

I hear they have a second wave of attack planned. I read it somewhere not sure where so I can't provide a source. BTC is hodling strong like a seasoned championship fighter. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:55:47
Congrats keep it up something is always better than nothing.  The price fluctuates so much that one week it could get cheaper and so forth. Do you use coinbase?

Ur not dumb ur just not informed. You just have to do ur research daily. Whatever question you have about crypto type it into the YouTube search bar. Im sure someone has a video about it. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:13:06
Plenty of videos on YouTube you can start there

@_date: 2017-11-17 18:38:11
I had this lmao
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:18:18
Use bittrex but you need to purchase btc 1st and transfer it over. Preferably from GDax 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:39:35
When you log into the ledger you only need to use the pin numbers that you selected. The 25 word phrase is just used for recovery.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:05:53

I know the feeling you'll get used to it. I started in mid August and I'm addicted. Made some mistakes but I'm constantly learning. The prices gonna go up and gonna come back down so far and so forth.

@_date: 2017-10-06 05:18:11
Since you have Coinbase use there exchange app called GDAX. You can set limit purchases free of charge. Since ur new it takes some getting used to. But you can learn a lot from YouTube and these forums.

Lmao ��������
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:59:41
Sometimes it takes longer sometimes it doesn't. On Gdax click on the horizontal liner to the right of ur name. Then click accounts then  tranfers. Then click btc account it should be a line that says withdraw. You should see ur transfer I'd, estimated payout, and btc transaction hash. If you don't see btc transaction hash that means the transaction action is still pending. If the hash is there copy it then go to blockchain.info. Paste the transaction hash in the search and you will see what's going on with the transaction.
@_date: 2017-10-14 10:21:07
Does it support crypto to crypto exchanges ie NLC2/DOGE
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:09:29
