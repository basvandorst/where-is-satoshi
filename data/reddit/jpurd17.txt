Okay yes they are not competing on hash power but I'm saying they are competing as base layer protocols. 
If I send a tx on BTC or LTC I want to know there is a certain amount of security spend giving assurance that tx will not be reversed. 
To compare these two protocols on their effectiveness of confirming transactions that will not get reversed, BTC is superior since it can achieve whatever $$ you consider to be a reasonable security spend much faster than LTC.

I know it's a meaningless chart haha, it's a joke playing off the long btc short the bankers meme

Bribing miners, buying/renting the hardware yourself. 
Obviously the latter take an additional cost but the figures in the chart are simply a floor for an attack. 
I'd suggest reading this as it lays out these ideas more coherently than I can in a reddit thread:

You seriously don't think BTC and LTC compete because of different hashing algos? That's nonsense.
Any chain looking to compete as money is in competition and an objective metric to compare them is how confident you can be that a transaction won't get reversed. By choosing a fixed security spend that gives you that confidence, you see BTC reaches that much faster than any other chain

The narrative of gold has always been right, but now digital gold can execute on it

I'm not misstating at all. MMT is directly linked to the Chartalist ideas from the early 20th century which state money in all forms is valuable due to it's acceptability and the ultimate form is in taxes to the State.
@_date: 2019-06-12 13:43:48
I implore you to read this paper - From the State Theory of Money to Modern Money Theory: An Alternative to Economic Orthodoxy 
I understand they are not one in the same but I think you'll have a tough time arguing the foundations of MMT weren't built on Chartalist ideas
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:14:59
MMT underlying premise: money is valuable because it is accepted by the State
Bitcoin shows that people value money completely separate from its acceptability from the State
@_date: 2019-06-14 13:40:36
I just struggle to see how one can subscribe to MMT and not have the Chartalist views regarding the nature of money
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:00:58
Agreed! I try not to even look at the prices even more because they honestly have no bearing on my opinions of this technology or the impact it will have!

maybe not bitcoin, as it has the highest probability of becoming a store of value akin to gold. For payments, it is likely another crypto currency will be used for every day payments in countries with highly unstable fiat in which case yes it could very well replace currencies starting with ones such as the Zimbabwe dollar, Venezuelan bolivar etc. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 13:09:55
It doesn't matter that gold isn't a "technology." The point is gold has a use case as a store of value, and there is now an alternative that has properties makes it a better store of value. People in countries with hyperinflating currencies clearly need something to store their wealth and bitcoin is absolutely a better means to do that because it is durable, divisible, transportable in ways gold never will be. Yes the track record is important but the longer bitcoin is around the more inherent trust people will have in it giving it the same legitimacy gold has.  
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:56:45
Okay and you are more than entitled to that opinion. Maybe in a decade or so you'll add
3.) I've seen a paradigm shift cause a piece of code to be more valuable than 5000 years of trust in a precious metal 
But there's nothing we can do except wait 
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:15:09
Actually bitcoin can be sent without internet via SMS or DVB-T. And still I'd take that over the impossibility of ever being able to send gold in any type of efficient, affordable means. 
Also if electricity "gets broken" there will be a lotttt more problems than being able to access your bitcoin or gold for that matter.

It's a take on how to rebut common arguments against bitcoin, by people like Jamie. Hence making them look stupid because the bitcoin is a "fraud, bubble, ponzi" statements are quite frankly illegitimate 
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:46:19
I fail to see how talking down bitcoin and DLT would benefit Buffet, it's not like his or Munger's anti-bitcoin commentary effects the stock price of a company like BNSF Railway so that Berkshire can secretly buy the dip. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:28:09
Argument being when people use the bitcoin is... not backed by anything, a bubble, tulip etc. that is by no means an argument against bitcoin. They look "stupid" for lack of a better word because those arguments are completely invalid to delegitimize bitcoin and cryptoassets as a whole and that was the point of the article
@_date: 2018-03-07 13:12:04
So hypothetically if large institutions and central banks start pouring money into bitcoin and it gains the same ~8trillion market cap gold has, you would still argue that bitcoin is not a store of value because it doesn't have "a proven track record?" I'm not trying to troll you here I genuinely want to understand where your coming from
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:55:40
At this point gold is over a $7 trillion market and there is no reason bitcoin cannot take at least 20% of that in the next few years. The only reason gold is that valuable an an investable asset is because it is scarce and people have ascribed it value for centuries. The latter will have no bearing in the future because as we have seen countless innovative technologies have completely dominated established ones that worked for ages. And the scarcity... well bitcoin is scarce AND has precisely known inflation schedule whereas there is still volatility in the supply of gold 
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:24:45
It seems that they are itching to increase exposure to DLT, they just fear the backlash that comes with being the first one to really get involved. I think once a large bank makes a major move into the space, the rest will shortly follow

And horses were used way before motors, way before any could even grasp the idea of electricity... Was that a good argument for why cars wouldn't ever be used to transport people more than horses?? 
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:42:55
Your argument... 
"btc could never replace gold as SoV because its been used for 5,000 years" 
is analogous to someone saying 
"Cars could never replace horses as primary means of transportation because they have been used for thousands of years"
@_date: 2018-02-24 00:26:02
Volatility will decrease with wider adoption and thus network value 
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:44:05
At the core yes, but I still think this is a good way to start bringing adoption to the masses. You are much more likely to educate yourself if you own bitcoin (yes even if it's an IOU on Robinhood). Once these newcomers start learning more they will more than likely realize they want to hold their own private keys.
