Some Algorithms are more optimizable than others.  Also, a multi Algorithm coin is possible and some exist.  Hashing could be made with enough different steps that a general purpose processor would be a competitive solution.
It wasn't the "speculative environment" that brought people to mining in 2009.  It was the level playing field.  You are only producing pennies of coins in a day of mining now...but it was the same back then.

What ruined adoption was the choice of SHA-256 hashing for mining.  Being able to mine money yourself with your computer's downtime was such a huge thing to bring people in.  The ability to do super efficient hashing with specialized hardware took away one of the biggest growth drivers.

I appreciate the sentiment but it's really not.  I think if one click ordering was really valuable someone would get it struck down.  It is just has a low value:effort ratio.  I 100% agree that the way we do patent/ copyright in this country is stifling innovation.
Anyhow luckily we are hitting the point that a lot of these stupid patents issued in the dotcom craze are about to expire.  1-click has less than 2 years left.
These stupid companies filing bitcoin patents may as well get it out of the way.  The sooner they file the sooner the bullshit expires.

That's a pretty reasonable guess for a low limit estimate, but i think if it happens in reality you will see much higher than that.  If people with real money ever decide to move significant amounts of their wealth into it the price will go much higher.  Someone with Bill Gates type money could raise the price to $5000 all by themselves (and that is in a vacuum where everyone is willing to sell, all mined bitcoins are still available, and nobody else is trying to buy).

People tend to assume that pricing is efficient (i.e. that the prove reflects the actual value of a commodity assuming the best available information).  Unfortunately in the real world this isn't the case.   The reality is that pricing is set very emotionally, and there can be a quite large disconnect between Market Cap and what an asset is truly worth. 
Let's say that I hit the markets hard for the next few weeks and buy up 1 million btc, lifting the price to $10,000 and quit buying when I hit my target.   At that point I decide to hodl until I can make a huge profit.  But instead of starting a big upswing like I intended with my manipulation,  just the opposite happens.   There is no support and the price collapses, gaining so much momentum that it crashes all the way down to $10.  
At that point what are my  1 million btc worth?   If we trust market cap they are only worth $10,000,000.  Is that right?   Maybe in a margin call... but most of the time I will just wait for price to recover to a point I am happy with before I sell. 
We are too obsessed with "last price" in this world.   It is an important metric, but it doesn't tell the whole story.  A flash crash doesn't mean that the value of a company dropped to a fraction of its previous worth for several minutes.   It means that someone screwed up and is pricing their shares well below what they are worth. 
Similarly,  you can't just multiply the current btc sell point by the outstanding number of btc and come up with a real value for the system.  It is much more complicated and impossible to calculate ate than that.

3.  You are comparing apples to oranges.  Bitcoin isn't a bank, it is cash.  People's wallet's get lifted and they lose their cash all the time.  As far as I know there isn't a trustworthy, properly insured bank that works in bitcoin yet.  It will happen some day.

You are dismissing network effect and first mover advantage.  Bitcoin is the most widely accepted Cryptocurrency because it was the first, and no one has come up with any significant innovation on it in 4.5 years even with open source software (I know there are coins that do things better, but nothing I would call significant).
Bitcoin becomes a self perpetuating loop.  It gets the most development because it has the most users because it is the most widely accepted because it is the most developed...  
That advantage can be lost, but not easily.  Once a currency is entrenched it is hard to replace simply because of momentum.  Look at the Dollar's international dominance for example.

Hyperinflation is not the same thing as bankruptcy. 
Taking Zimbabwe as an example:
The hyperinflation was largely caused by the mass printing of money to pay off debts to the IMF, thus avoiding bankruptcy.  Eventually hyperinflation hit the point that no one would accept the Zimbabwe Dollar any more, and Zimbabwe was forced to switch to foreign currencies for commerce.  Now that they have lost control of their currency, they need to actually raise the money for debt payments through taxes and the possibility of bankruptcy is very real.

Fees are currently stopping a new adoption wave.  I know I got in because I was excited about trustless digital cash.  I wouldn't have cared very much about a trustless digital settlement layer for a non-existant voucher network.
Having been here in 2013 I remember what excitement looks like.  I remember what hitting all-time highs and massive good news did for user base/ subscribers.  What is happening here and now is a joke.
Maybe big blocks would ultimately choke out bitcoin by making nodes too heavy, I can't see the future.  I can see the present where bad confirmation speeds and awful fees are killing use for the little people and killing adoption.  I know how I would have reacted if that was my first experience the first time I bought 10 bucks worth to play with.
Price is still going up.  Bitcoin still has momentum and first mover advantage, but anyone that thinks $100 or $30 or even $2 fees aren't going to kill that when there are far cheaper alternatives out there is fooling them-self.

I don't think that the miners have any interest in doing anything off-chain.  Why on earth would they want to skim the cream off of LESS transactions?  It doesn't make any sense.  Miners are selfish and will do whatever they think will pull the most profit.  As of right now that is allowing a little supply squeeze to pop up fees, but that won't last long, because if there really starts to be a transaction backlog they will be sad about all the money they leave on the table when they process a block.  
You talk as if the traffic cap is driving people away...but that obviously isn't true because there is still a traffic problem.  Long term, the blocksize drama will end just as soon as it becomes clear to the miners that the status quo is costing them money.  They will probably settle on a solution which keeps transaction fees higher than you would like.  Cest la vie.

I don't believe we have the luxury of time to let fees continue to run up while segwit passes and lighting is developed.  
Average fee is over $1.00 today.  How much further do you think that will go up before new adoption grinds to a halt?  Do you think Ethereum is going to stop moving forward while the mess gets sorted?

I would argue that since the world has only been off the gold standard for barely a century we are very premature in declaring fiat stable, especially considering I am not aware of any fiat currency that has dropped less than 99% of it's value during that time period.
Day to day stability will always go to the central banks, but to be fair we can't expect Bitcoin to maintain it's current volatility were it to ever become a major currency.  At worst the value swings should be similar to Gold in the 1800's, but really it should be far better than that, considering the supply swings gold (and silver) had during that period.

That is 100% false.  Libertarians pursue limited government, not abolishment of it.


So a government with their people's faith can print an unlimited amount of money with out depreciating it's value?  Then why do we have a national debt?  Why is the government so obtuse that they don't just give the poor millions?  Wouldn't making all the people rich increase their faith in the Government?


No, what you are missing is that what has been going on for thousands of years is the government issuance of coinage.  The governments did not give these coins value, the metal did.  What the government brought to the table was a trustworthy standard purity and weight.  If you held an Italian Florin in your hand for ~300 years you had faith that the Florentine government had put 54 grains of pure unadulterated gold into it.  The coin wouldn't be worth less if the government fell, it was only worth less when they started putting less Gold in them.  
The government establishing standard weights on coins was a great thing.  Attempts at Fiat Currency, such as those under the Yuan and Ming Dynasties in China were short lived and disastrous.

I fail to understand what you are hinting at.  A monetary authority can do a lot to move a currency one direction or the other, but they are not setting value, they are manipulating public faith to believe that the money supply is at the proper level.  If central banks could set value at will, the Weimar Republic would still be around and Adolf Hitler would be a nameless painter you never heard of.

I'm glad you see reason.


I hate to tell you, but Split Tallys are a ledger system.  They are more similar to Bitcoin than a fiat currency.  The currency that England was using for those 700 years was precious metal coinage until 1914.
@_date: 2016-12-27 19:51:32
I agree.  I don't think there is enough history in bitcoin for anything to really be properly priced in.  There just isn't any historical analog to pull data from.  I can't think of any other asset in history with so little supply elasticity.  There just aren't any marginal reserves  (excepting fat wallets in the hands of early adopters) to tap when demand spikes.
Because there aren't any familiar examples, I think that it is really poorly understood how much price can rise when supply gets restricted.  I think people's gut feeling is that reducing supply by half justifies maybe a doubling in price, but what really happens is a much greater increase.
@_date: 2016-12-13 21:21:18
Tiny compared to total trading volume... but traders can produce a huge amount of volume relative to net coin movement. Price spikes do pull out a lot of marginal reserves, but dont think that a steady trickle isn't massively draining the bucket
@_date: 2016-12-21 01:21:55
I disagree.  When you get down to it they were inflating supply by selling coins they didn't have.  They were massively pumping hype though.  On the balance I would guess we are pretty far below where we would be if they had been honest dealers though.  The blow to confidence their collapse and exposure caused was enormous.

The way I see it, accepting a bitcoin transaction is like accepting a check.  0 confirmation is fine if I am    selling something that shipping can be canceled or if the cost is so low that I can eat the cost of an occasional shoplifter.  If I am selling you a car with bitcoin I would probably make you wait a confirmation or two before I gave you the keys.  If I am trading you bitcoin for several million dollars in gold bullion, we are going to sit down for a while and wait the full 7 confirmations.

You can't tell everyone that your opinion is the only one that matters and then pretend they are the ones causing the problem when they build their own implementation.
It doesn't matter whose approach is superior, core's political refusal to compromise is causing the splits.  Furthermore, coninuing this attitude will continue causing splits until they lose dominance.  Whatever their programming prowess is, they are absolute failures politically.

I don't know how to break this to you buddy, but sometimes people are dishonest.  They use buzzwords and technical jargon to dazzle people who know even less than they do.

If they are asked about it a couple years later they can honestly say "Yes, we looked at solution X, but solution Y was a better fit."  They don't need to tell you that they knew 'X' was a bust all along.  All that was important to them was that 'X' was making a lot of noise and capturing a lot of VC.

This is shockingly (/s) one sided.  The main oppositition to segwit is about the long term direction of bitcoin.  The Core developers are trying to make a future of eternally small blocks where the Bitcoin blockchain is only used for settlement.  The vast majority of traffic would take place off-chain through the lightning network.  **Small users will be totally priced out of using the blockchain.** 
This system isn't necessarily doomed to failure, but it totally transforms what bitcoin is.  Bitcoin will no longer be digital cash, it will be a settlement layer for companies selling you bitcoin denominated tokens (much like a bank and checking accounts).  The whole trustless peer-to-peer aspect will be gone because of high fees.  Users will be forced into "bank" accounts by transaction price.  So the whole "be your own bank" aspect will be dead.
After users are all centralized into banking platforms regulation and seizure becomes trivial for governments, which is an important worry.
Why is Core pushing for this?  A number of the most prominent core developers are associated with Blockstream, a company that develops second layer solutions (i.e. they have the jump on off-chain transactions).
Right or wrong, the Unlimited group is following Satoshi's vision.  They intend to allow for massive growth and hope that technical hurdles with storage and transmission can be developed as time goes on.
Unlimited's weakness imho isn't their political position, I like what Bitcoin is, I'm not in a rush to fundamentally change it.  Their weakness is buggy software.  They have a development team a fraction of the size of Core's.
Personally I would like both solutions implemented.  Off-chain transactions are super useful, but Core's intransigence on block size in the short term (no one believes that 2 MB is too big for the network to handle, why have we forced an artificial crisis?) and statements by some members that they think blocks are already too big make me question their motives.

I believe that the common model Fiat currency that we see in the world today (ESPECIALLY the American Dollar) are designed to silently transfer wealth upwardly to the wealthy and the government.  I recognize the inherent weakness of specie currency, yet still believe it to be a far superior option to the current status quo.
I think it is theoretically possible to produce a fiat that isn't evil, but the temptation is great for those in power to keep the thumb on the scale in their own favor.  I would personally much rather have a slightly unsteady currency that favors no one than a steadily inflating currency that robs wealth from savers and makes it easy for corporations to disguise pay cuts as small raises.
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:30:43
it is a shame that a more ASIC resistant algorithm wasn't chosen.  One of the big pushes for the spread of the currency was that anyone could mine some without investing any cash in the operation.
With rewards the way they are, chinese mines are inevitable, as are the eventual end of large scale centralized mining.
Eventually ALL mines will operate at a slight monetary loss and the "profit" will be the waste heat that is generated.  Mining will be dominated by places where electric heating is used, and the countries that dominate the mining market will swing with the seasons.

You snide fuckers toss that around without really knowing shit about it.  "Haha stupid dutch blew their savings on flowers..."
The reality is that prices skyrocketed over what was thought to be an ultra-rare new breed of multicolored tulip.  Breeding them out into a commercially viable line would be expected to take years and a massive investment in time.  Prices for the few existing bulbs skyrocketed accordingly.  Although they may have gotten carried away, the prices were at least theoretically justifiable because they were buying breeding stock, not flowers for your front yard.
The collapse wasn't just a "bubble popping."  It was discovered that the beautiful multicolored effect wasn't from breeding but was in fact a disease that could be spread to any common bulb through exposure.  All those ultra-rare bulbs could suddenly be mass produced at will.
Bitcoin, unlike your precious Fiat currencies, is specifically designed against this sort of supply inflation.  The problem that caused the Tulip Bubble to pop can literally not happen to Bitcoin.  Ever.
Bitcoin may succeed, it may fail, but it will never be a Tulip Craze.

Mining centralization is a problem, but it is one that I believe will eventually solve itself.  Right now mining is centralized in places with cheap electricity...but my belief is that eventually it will settle in to places where waste heat is desired.  Bitcoin Mining Space heater for the decentralization win!
Altogether, the rise of ASICs was a tragedy.  CPU mining was such a great hook to pull people into the community and produce organic growth.  It is a shame that they weren't able to get algorithm change through before the ASICs took over.  I don't know how you could do it now.
Centralising transaction providers, such as Lightning will naturally tend towards is a problem that will not solve itself, it will naturally tend to get worse and worse.  There needs to be some method to keep on chain transactions relatively cheap.
I believe that at least the idea of BU balances out segwit.  Miners at least have the option to keep fees low enough that they will pull a significant portion of transactions.  Given one or the other, I really worry about the long term consequences of segwit.  I do not want to  see bitcoin coopted by a government and I believe that is the ultimate destiny for a Segwit only future.

Bitcoin has a lot of upward pressure gold doesn't have.  While bitcoin movement will probably move more closely to gold than the dollar, they certainly aren't the same thing and won't move in unison.
That said, it is the size difference that is truly important.  It is difficult to wrap your head around how truly huge these global markets are.  The bitcoin market has a 1 billion dollar cap. So the entire bitcoin market, what's in motion plus what is "hoarded," is less than .5% of the $240 Billion of gold that is traded each day!  We are literally talking 4 or 5 orders of magnitude difference in trading volume.  If every single bitcoin buy was made in lieu of a gold buy the effect would still only be to the tune of a penny or two an ounce.

I am not rich, but I have beat the markets every year since I started investing.  My best piece of advice I can give is not to invest in something without really knowing it.  You should know the investment inside and out.  You should know potential strengths and weaknesses.  Most of all, you should decide what something is worth independently of what the market says.  Only once you have done that can you decide if something is a good buy.
I have bought a stock, watched it decline 30% and bought more while the painickers sold.  I could do this because I was confident in my valuation.  When you invest this way you don't freak out about market dips, you long for them.  
Evaluate bitcoin.  Figure out how big you think the market will eventually be.  Figure out how many will actually be in circulation rather than in savings (hoarded if you are a critic).  Figure out if you really think there is a future for the idea.  Once you have done that figuring a target price is a simple math problem and you will know whether to buy.
Finally, don't put all your eggs in one basket.  However smart you are you can't predict the future.  Bitcoin has the possibility (however unlikely) to be broken and become instantly useless.  Spread your assets around a variety of securities and rebalance the percentages regularly.    That way if one of your investments ever fails you do't lose everything (it also leaves you with assets to liquidate if you ever get an opportunity to buy really cheaply).

1.  Your math is bad.  A 30% reduction in hashing power results in less than a 50% increase in time to find a block.  So 15 minutes/3 weeks.  Hardly a crisis.
2. Few if any miners will drop.  If bitcoin crashes back to $100 it is still in the same range or higher than what it was when anyone with delivered asics payed for their devices.  Non-ASIC devices are already unprofitable. 
3.  Regardless of if you will ever break even, there is no asic that costs more to run than the electricity to run it, even at $50.   So regardless of whether or not a device will ever break even in bitcoin terms, if you have one there is no reason to shut it off

You aren't alone my friend.  
Friedcat is awfully tightlipped lately.  It seems that the Gen2 chips were a BIG failure and that is why hashrate has hardly budged for months.  Very depressing.
However, I have been buying more shares and here is why:  Asicminer was running concurrent development for 3rd gen chips.  Assuming these chips work when they arrive, they will be in a place to dominate the market again.  I know the immersion cooled shipping containers look like a joke, but if you really look into it they are a great development.  It will allow superdense, easily upgradeable deployment with ultra-low cooling costs.  
Friedcat has stated that they are working on an exchange, that should be a profit center once up.  They recently hired R&amp;D staff, showing commitment to the future.  Most importantly Friedcat has never sold a single share.  If he isn't panic selling, why should I?
Edit:  wait, what am I saying?  Sell. Sell now, before its too late!  Import your shares to havelock and panic dump!  For the love of God, do it now!

If you are new to investing and the study of how money works in general [Harry Browne's radio show]( is an excellent place to start.  It is an investment show by a guy who made a fortune off of the big Gold rise in the 70's.  His basic investing rules have served me very well financially.  I am not wealthy, but percentage wise I have done very well investing.
I recommend the first few episodes to everyone.  They are full of good advice.  The later episodes get a little like beating a dead horse because his investment strategy is so simple there is only so much that can be said about it.  You definitely can understand it without listening very long.

Ahh, I see where you are going.  No one would buy a product they could get cheaper in the future.  That is why no one has a cell phone or a computer.  It makes perfect sense now.
In reality humans are intelligent actors that put a high value on immediate satisfaction.  There is also a feedback effect that if too many people "hoard," the resulting price drop will result in immediate spending and restabilization.
THe "need" for inflation is to keep governments from collapsing under their debt, not to keep the currency stable.  The stabilization effect is a lie that everyone keeps telling each other because they don't want the music to stop on their watch.
Now before you go spouting some B.S. proof about gold causing panics in the 1800's I want you top take a minute and look at the data yourself.  Most of the bad deflationary periods are immediately following wars, while the currency stabilized after wartime debt inflation.  The remaining periods were generally caused by bank shenanigans and were certainly no worse than what we have had under the federal reserve.

Actually the trend for transaction fees is downward for the time being.  If we start pushing against the block size limit that may change, but I don't think we need to worry about that pushing transaction fees too far out of hand, people will just begin to bundle transactions.

Being able to be at the front of the queue in a panic is nice, but really, not panicking is nicer.  The people at the front of the line lose least, but the people who get rich buy while everyone else sells.  IF the price has gotten so high that a 20% drop would send you for the door in a panic you should be selling now. 
There is no shame in locking in profits.  It is actually a really smart thing to do.  If all of your money is in one security(including the US Dollar) you are risking all of your money.  Diversify, that way when a drop comes the "OMG I could lose everything" doesn't cross your mind and you aren't the idiot who panic sells at $100 right before it bounces back to $185.

It has value when you lost your smart phone. It has value after an emp strike or massive solar flare.  The only thing that is truly worth it's weight in gold is gold.  Gold has a track record longer than history, it's going to take bitcoin a few years to achieve parity.

I guess "demand" for money is basically the amount of new money that needs to be injected into a system to keep prices steady.  
Let's say your country has a 3% population growth rate, and a .5% money destruction rate(money that leaves circulation permanently for one reason or another).  Your central bank would need to increase the money supply by 3.5% every year just to keep prices from going up.  Even thought you are printing a pretty significant amount of currency, you aren't outpacing supply, so your monetary policy isn't inflationary.
Right now bitcoin is an extreme example of this.  The 14% increase in supply each year sounds huge, but demand is growing even faster, so it is still deflationary.
@_date: 2013-09-01 12:15:28
I didn't mean that to sound like a plan.  I have no interest in blowing bubbles.  My point was that it doesn't seem to me that mining is a large enough supply of coins to hold the price as low as it is. 
Let me come at this from a different angle.  [Six percent of internet users use reddit](  So we can be really conservative by guessing that less than 1/4 of active bitcoin users are on reddit and members of this sub.
That guesstimate would give us an active bitcoin user base of &gt; 200,000 people.  With that many users, at today's rates, each user averaging a purchase of $30/week soaks up all the freshly minted coins.  
That seems like an absurdly low average to me, especially considering I am probably underestimating the global user base.  It seems to me that there must be additional supply holding the price low, which could only come from big "hoarders" liquidating their holdings.  I was wondering what others thought about that theory.

They are in ICO stage, meaning they aren't available on an exchange.  Right now you can buy direct from the site and when the chain is started you will receive your share.  
Obviously this ratchets up your level of risk.  You are buying coins on an unlaunched chain from internet strangers.  Usual advice of do your homework and only invest what you can afford to lose etc.

I see "The Gold Standard was awful" as a tenet of faith from mainstream economics.  The gold standard caused deflationary slowdowns and a boom and bust cycle.  How is this worse than today? 
 The panic of 1907 led to the creation of the federal reserve.  It was caused by banks gambling there way into insolvency and eventually led to the stock market collapsing almost 50%  Has the Fed corrected things like this from happening?
The great depression happened after the Fed was established.  [According to Milton Freidman and Ben Bernanke, the Fed caused the great depression.](
I have looked at charts of the economy on the gold standard.  I very closely studied the 19th century.  You know what I saw?
I saw double digit inflation in 1812 when the government was borrowing to cover a war.  Than I saw a decade long rapid deflationary period whil wartime spending stopped and repayment began.  Then I saw 40 years straight where inflation/deflation floated around 0.  Incedentally, this period was the closest the U.s. ever came to being out of debt.  Then there was massive inflation while the government borrowed to fight the civil war, and deflation afterward as prices came back down.  Then another 30 years of fairly steady prices, then world war 1 and massive inflation.  See a pattern?
There were panics.  Even some severe ones.  From what I have read they were generally caused by banks investing poorly.  I suspect the FDIC has done a lot more to stop panics than the Fed has.  What the Fed has done is run the economy through the Great Depression, the industrial collapse and massive inflation of the 70's and early 80's, and the lost decade from 2000 til now, all the while destroying the savings of anyone that had the audacity to save for their future.  
If you put a dollar in a jar and saved it in 1800 it was worth about 2 Dollars by 1900.  If you but a Dollar in a jar in 1900 it was worth about 2 cents by 2000.  Is that really what is good for people?

While I agree with you in general, a rising difficulty rate makes delivery time a signicant factor in the value of their product.  How would you feel about getting a slightly rotted layer cake being delivered 2 weeks after it was supposed to be there for your wedding?  The bakery provided updates on their progress, and their updates tell you they didn't even order flour til 2 days after the wedding and sugar another 3 days after that.  With each update along the way they tell you it will be ready in a few hours, but it becomes painfully obvious that not even gross incompetence could have allowed them to screw up delivery estimates that bad.  Once the cake is finally finished they don't rush to deliver as fast as humanly possible, instead they choose to first send samples of your cake to reviewers to try and drum up more cake orders.  In the meantime  your cake loses even more of its already diminished value.  Would you say "Oh well, I guess the bakery is just horrible with time tables?"

This isnt a company that bought some asics and will have a slowly dropping mining share.  This is a company that was the first to have a functioning asic that reinvests a significant portion of its profits.  They are at 20% of the network and growing with 10x their current hashing power already paid for and being produced.  Even at 5% of all remaining bitcoins to be mined (half of which will be mined in the next 4 years) this is a fair price...and that is totally ignoring transaction fees and hardware sales.

I think that in the immediate future asics will tend to centalize into data processing centers for efficiency.  This wont last long though.

It will be something to see mining shift hemispheres with the seasons.
@_date: 2013-03-15 21:12:51
You are getting it backwards.  The speed of mining doesn't change with the advent of ASICs.  The price per bitcoin sets how many ASICS can be on the network and still profitably operate.  You can expect the hashing power of the network as a whole to steadily increase towards the cost of electricity the mined bitcoins would buy.

At some point they will want to shut bitcoin down.  They did it to gold in 1932.  They can't have a steady or deflating currency easily accessible to the proletariat.  If you allow that no one will have any interest in holding dollars and watching their savings inflate away.  Once people start to pull out the dollar collapses, inflation gets out of control, and the Fed is forced to jack interest rates up to slow it.  Once interest rates are high the government is forced to get it's spending under control or be buried by compounded interest.  That isn't something they want.  The government is very happy to pay for all the things it can't afford with inflation, the invisible tax.  Once they figure out bitcoin is for real they will do everything in their power to break it.  I think they will be too late by the time they try, but don't be so naive to think they won't.  There are a lot of very rich and powerful with a large vested interest in maintaining the central banking systems of the world the way they are.

You are making the assumption that people are buying expensive new hardware.

When it is no longer profitable for asicminer to pay for industrial cooling to run its 10GH/s blades do you think they will throw them away?  No, they will sell them off to people that for one reason or other don't mind the waste heat.  
Long term this will lead to a situation where those that have to pay for cooling can't compete with those who don't.  When that point hits, bye bye centralized mining companies.

Butterfly is still more than 6 months back on their delivery queue.  I don't think any of their products have ever been delivered on time, or made a positive ROI vs just buying Bitcoin instead.  They treat their customers like garbage and have terrible ethics.  (i.e. charge for express shipping and deliver by same method, take money for an "upgrade" option, then deliver the same speed to everyone).  
It is doubtful that any mining equipment purchase will secure a positive ROI vs. just buying BTC right now.  Out of available options, Butterfly has the worst track record.

There is no "safe" investment.  Treasury bonds lost most of their value during the inflation of the 70's.  Gold dropped from 800 to 300 in the 80's and stayed their til the 2000's.  We have seen the stock market lose half it's value twice in the past 15 years.
The only safety in investing comes through diversification.  If you had a portfolio with equal portions of gold, 30 year bonds, cash, and a total stock market fund you would have earned 10% per year since 1972 with none of the volitility of the underlying securities.  This is my current plan, using bitcoin for the cash portion (plus a few that I won't sell no matter what in case they do hit a million each).  This way, even if bitcoin crashes to 0 I will still have profited from it.

You apparently don't understand how stock works.  After the IPO the stock price doesn't mean shit to the issuer.  Unless they are attempting to issue more shares - which ASICMINER isn't - the price is irrelevent for them.  They do not profit off increased share price in any way except through selling their personal holdings, which as far as I know  Neither Friedcat nor anyone else at bitfountain has attempted to do.
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:29:56
The scarcity of bitcoin is something that people know, but they don't really understand it.  There has never been anything like it in history; a commodity with zero marginal reserves.  It doesn't matter how much demand rises, no additional supply comes on-line.  The spikes should strain credibility, everything we know operates differently.

Either I am misunderstanding you or you are wrong.  If you try to change the proof of work, any one with an asic (I.e. the majority of the network hashing power) would refuse to go along with it.  They would have no choice, they can't do any other proof of work.  This would lead to 2 competing block chains with the vast majority of the hashing power on the sha-256 side. Everyone would have to pick sides and it would be a big damn mess.   It would  be a disaster for the whole system.  If the changed POW side did eventually "win" it would be at the cost of setting bitcoin back several years.

Not exactly.  Jalepenos were supposed to pull 4.5 GH from one chip.  Once they started testing they couldn't hit speed without getting hotter than the surface of the sun.   So now they are putting 2 chips in per jaly, downclocked to stay cool.  
Well, now they have improved their boards some more and added a better heat sink and they are able to safely get 3.5 per chip.  They aren't going to just give that extra 2 GH/s away, so they charge you an extra hundred bucks to not downclock the chips to 2.5 each.
They also say the upgraded units get binned chips with more functional cores.  I don't know what their fallout is for bad cores , but I can't imagine it's that terribly high.  Of course this is butterfly, who knows.
I upgraded, but I bet it won't be too long before someone figures out how to unlock the extra hashing power for everyone with a firmware update or or a jumper or something.

Do a backtest.  Pick some random date, and start yourself with an imaginary $1000 dollars.  Put a third of that imaginary money into bitcoins and rebalance it back to a third every time bitcoins rise or fall 30% from your last rebalance point.  You will be amazed by the return you get without ever risking more than a third of your money.
The best part is that the trading can all be done with limit orders, so you don't have to pay attention at all.

So rather than printing money to directly finance the government, it instead borrows the money from the market and the market in turn sells the debt instruments to the Fed.  The only difference I see is that there is an extra layer of bullshit to give a couple extra percent to the Fed's banking cronies.  Supposedly the Fed is going to sell the securities back into the market as the economy recovers.  I will believe it when I see it.  Is there something I am missing?

I am no believer in debtors prison, but when you own a financial institution it is your responsibility to sufficiently protect assets of customers.   If you fail you are responsible to make what restitution you can.   If your assets can't cover the debts, that is what bankruptcy is for.  Trade fortress was the one profiting from the company.   He was the one responsible for the security.   He was the one who choose not to carry insurance.  In all likelyhood he is the one who stole the assets.

Both have their places.  The bulk of your holdings should be physical, but keeping a portion in an etf is just too convenient to be ignored for portfolio balancing.
Remember there are lots of risks and costs assocated with different types of holdings.  By only dealing in physical gold you guarantee that your trading cost is big.  I have to pay 8% sales tax where I live, on top of the dealer's cut.  Also, thus far the only gold I have ever lost was physical gold stolen in a break-in.

Fluctuations happen, but when I look at the numbers I see no evidence that fluctuations were worse under the gold standard than they are now.  The panic of 1907 (which was so severe that it led to the creation of the federal reserve) was certainly no worse than the 2008 recession.  The difference was that the panic of 1906 had the total destruction of San Fransisco as a trigger.  Destroy one of our cities now and see what happens.  We had a massive panic from 2 buildings getting destroyed.
The great depression is often blamed on gold, nobody ever mentions that the federal reserve was already monkeying with things for 15 years by 1928.

They have sold, are selling, and will sell in the future, but they won't just decide to dump their shares all at once, because that is  precisely the least profitable thing they could do.  If one of them maliciously did it, the market would plunge, and then the coins would get absorbed and distributed, and things would go back to normal.  Then you would never have to worry about it happening again, because the nutjob that did it would be all out of coins.

Dollar cost average, only use a fraction of your total investments. blah blah blah.  Come back to reality, don't make massive gambles trying to double your money every month, and be ecstatic about your 50% a year return.  If the price drops, don't panic, just buy some more at a discount.  If the price rises, don't get greedy, sell some and take a profit.  If you run this way you can make a nice return without getting an ulcer.  It won't make you rich overnight, but it wont make you broke either.

 The odds are truly beyond what the human brain can get a grip on.  I can tell you there are more addresses than there are atoms in the sun and all your brain can register is, "That's a lot." Just like, "more than there are molecules of water in the ocean" or "balls in the ball pit at Chuck E. Cheese."  When you are dealing with numbers that immense, doubling or tripling or increasing your odds of collision a millionfold are really meaningless, because the chance of collision will still be basically zero.

You need me to imagine a bad scenario for you?  Here:  U.S. Government decides that bitcoin is a threat to the dollar's stability and outlaws it.  Then to combat "fiscal terrorism" it turns Forte Meade into an ASIC factory and launches a surprise 51% attack.  If they have their kill switches approved at this point they could supplement the attack by shutting down sections of the net with heavy concentrations of independent miners.  By the time the dust settles confidence in bitcoin would be wrecked, if the blockchain were salvageable at all.
Is this scenario likely? I hope not, but don't act like it's impossible.  In 1933 they made private ownership of gold illegal and declared everyone who held more than 10 oz. a criminal.  They are not above ruining anybody who stands in their way when their monetary policy is threatened.

What we are seeing now is what securities traders call "resistance."  It is a psychological thing.  A fairly large portion of the market gets a number in their head that they think a security should be worth and they hold it there.  In this case there seems to be a large number of people who think that bitcoins can't be worth more than $50, so they set limit orders to sell as we approach that point.  This stops it from ever actually getting to $50.  Often (but certainly not always) what happens is that a security price will beat against this artificial ceiling for a while until it exhausts the resistance(the people who are selling run out of shares to sell).  
The funny thing about people is that they like round numbers. There are  lots of people that don't think bitcoins are quite worth $50.00, but not nearly as many who think they aren't quite worth $51.73.  So what happens is it takes a lot of upward pressure for the price to break the resistance point, but once it does it rapidly flies up til it finds a new one.  I think we are just gathering steam for the next breakout.

However durable you believe bitcoin to be, it still isn't as durable as gold.  I know that the internet seems eternal, but there are a good few scenarios that would hobble us technologically.  These are black swan events, but not implausible.  How useful would bitcoin be too you if you were within range of an emp event?  If your country decided to shut off the internet under some pretense of emergency?  Can you ever be truly certain that some nasty birus won't totally fuck the bitcoin economy?
Bitcoin has a lot of advantages over gold, but when it comes to durability gold has no peer.

Bullshit.  On the average it produces less money for investors, but you have to be careful applying averages to individual cases.  On the whole homeowners insurance produces worse outcomes for property owners, but you'll be sorry if you don't have it when your house burns down.  
Ask someone who went all in  if they are happy with their "better outcome."

Good question, Friedcat was giving out around .02Btc per week until everyone got their initial investment back, then he buckled down and put a lot of money into buying more equipment.  I believe as a rule he is reinvesting half the profits.  Recently Dividends have been around .006btc, but they were a little higher this week since we started selling hardware.  Most importantly all the equipment that was purchased with retained earnings is starting to come online.  I expect to see .01 Btc this week and .015 the week after.
Friedcat is a good manager, working for long term profitability.  You already know he isn't a scam, since they have paid out more dividends than what they took in at IPO.  If there is anybody I trust in bitcoinland, it is Friedcat and Asicminer.  My only worry is the SEC will come in and shut the stock market down and make life a big pain in the ass for everybody.

Estimated reward = roughly what you will receive if the pool finds a block right now.  
Blocks are found randomly, but slush is averaging roughly an hour to find one lately.  We had one go 14 hours last week.  Shit happens.
When a block is found, the pool chews on everybody's input for a few minutes and adds your share to your unconfirmed total..
After enough confirmations go by the share for that block moves into your confirmed total.  This takes about a day.

As a guy with significantly more manufacturing experience than most, electronics and otherwise, I can assure you assembly will not be a significant factor in shipment.  I've worked with guys that could put 200 Jalepenos together in a day without batting an eye.  If Butterfly had the parts they could have 15 temps there tomorrow popping out singles like fast food hamburgers.
As a preorder customer it pains me to admit that their capacity is probably just another one of their lies.  I do believe they are on the cusp of shipping...just that it will probably be 300 units a week.  It has taken them 3 months to do 6 wafers, are we supposed to believe they will immediately gear up to 2-3 wafers per day?

This article is wrong in fact.  Gold and silver were used in trade before coinage, coinage merely made them more convenient to use by standardizing weights and eliminating the need for a scale at every transaction.  Proper coinage did not derive it's value from the state stamp on the front of it, and certainly did not lose it's value when the state collapsed.  That is only the fate of Fiat money.   To imply otherwise is misleading, probably intentionally.

That is a preposterous statement.  Stocks stay in the range around a hundred dollars because they are artificially split to stay there.  This is done because it is hard to buy a half share of stock.  Not every company does this.  Check out Berkshire Hathaway for example.
Bitcoins are limited in supply, if you want an example of how fast the price can go up when the general public gets wind of things, look up the tulip craze.

Totally ignoring that by saving you are increasing the value of circulating currency.  Keynesians like formulas, as such they get hung up on what is easy to measure.  It is easy to "see" the money saved in banks and calculate a stimulative effect from if that money were withdrawn and spent.  It is much harder to calculate what inflationary effect will occur from that theoretical withdrawl, so guess what gets ignored?

Don't get me wrong, I am very much "in" on bitcoin.  I put 1/3 of my meager portfolio into bitcoin.  I sold enough to buy a BFL miner and the leftover is now 1/2 my portfolio.  I just don't think that it really works as a hedge against anything with it's volatility.
Before bitcoin I just held 1/2 my money in a total stock market ETF and the other half in gold, rebalancing when things got out of whack.  2008 didn't hurt at all cause of the rise in gold, and the rise of stocks since has kept me doing well.  Too bad I started with nothing.  Earning 60% on a few hundred dollars doesn't make you very rich :)

By "The Feds" I assume you don't mean NSA.  They are widely known t be years ahead in cryptography.  They are so thorough at recruiting that they leave a talent vacuum behind in the cryptographic field.  They also aren't famous for sharing with other agencies.
The dollar being replaced as the world's reserve currency is a real threat to how our government wants the world to be.  The question isn't whether they would act against such a threat, it is whether they will see it in time to do something.  
I hope you are right that that day is already past.  It's just we have no idea what their capabilities truly are, only that they are massive.  We are certain that the NSA has the most powerful machines for cryptography in the world, but how powerful are they?  Maybe they are larger versions of equipment we know.  Maybe they are well developed quantum computers.  The only safe bet is that they aren't going to tell us any time soon.

I understand why you think that but it is wrong.  The cost of hashing only controls the price as long as the global mining rate is lower than global demand.  With only 3600 coins being minted per day, I'm fairly certain we are past that point.
Bitcoin isn't a standard commodity where higher prices lead to marginal mining reserves being brought online which in turn brings prices down. The supply of bitcoins is basically fixed at 2.5 coins/minute for the whole world.  It doesn't matter if the network is producing a petaHash each second or a kiloHash, bitcoin production stays the same (or occasionally drops by half).
When your supply is fixed price change comes 100% from fluctuations in demand.   As more people adopt demand rises, and so do prices to match.  At this stage of the game we are insulated from a huge price run up because lots of early adopters have huge reserves they dump whenever the price spikes.  These reserves wont last forever, eventually the market will absorb the excess.
Once that happens the sky is the limit for the price.  As the price spikes tons of new hashing power will come online because it will be worth chasing tiny fractions of a coin at the new ridiculous prices.  All that new hashing power still wont increase supply, and consequently will have no effect on pricing.

Are you really going to give me shit for making a "snarky condescending reply" to someone commenting that Bitcoin is useless as currency and anyone with a different opinion is an idiot?
Moreover, saying that gold wasn't used as currency is either malicious revisionism or blatant ignorance - either way it is totally untrue.  The earliest coinage was stamped in Lydia out of electrum, which is a Gold/Silver Alloy.  The use of gold as a basis for currency has been common all over the world on and off ever since.  Even if you want to totally ignore the gold based currencies that dominated the world preceding the last century, you don't have to go back very far to find gold coinage being very important in trade.  The Italian Florin dominated commerce in Europe for 300 years!
I'll save the condescension and serve you with straight disdain.  Take your lies elsewhere.  The Bitcoin sub is filled with people that know more about the history of Currency than what is in Paul Krugman's latest column.

I am hardly an idealist, I just take the long view on the word "Eventually."  The Fed held gold artificially at $30 for 4 decades,and now world governments depress it's price with ridiculous tax rates and other tricks.  I hope that selling the same gold 3 times wasn't one of them, that would simply be devastating to the world economy.  If they did that it goes beyond manipulation and becomes straight up fraud.  
Germany is already pulling it's gold out of the Fed and bringing it home.  If more countries do this due to currency instability as the gold leaves the Fed it will essentially be a margin call.  Hiding such shenanigans wouldn't be an option.

OP is a huge troll over on the forum.  He blows everything out of proportion as solid evidence of a scam.  I think it is more likely he is a daytrader trying to amplify fluctuations.  Remember that these bitcoin stocks are very thinky traded and assholes stand to make a lot of money by making a  move and then convincing others to do go the opposite direction.
That said, There are people who say there is no possible way the demo boards could be functional.   I will admit that to be legit it seems they must be using an unusual process, but I am not an EE and even less a PCB expert.  I suspect that most people screaming "scam" are even less qualified than I, and I suspect everyone's motives (Especially those who scream the loudest).
Honestly I just don't see the return for them to be scamming.   They collected near 1 million dollars at IPO.  If they were going to take their money and run that would have been the time to do it.  Why waste time updating forum posts and doctoring pictures?  It's not like they get any return from pumping price unless they sell their shares, which the exchange owner has confirmed they aren't doing.

This is one of the complaints of economists against deflation.  There is "resistance" if  you try to drop workers wages numerically (e.g. people get pissed off when you cut their pay for a reason they don't understand).  They say this will lead to a drop in employment (I don't understand that part).  All I can tell is mainstream economists think it is perfectly acceptable for workers to take a paycut every year in real wages.  That is the real joke, the keynesians intend to pay for their social programs by draining the savings accounts of the rich with inflation, but in reality the rich do just fine with their money in stocks and such, while the social programs are a yoke on the backs of low income workers who don't understand what inflation is doing to their wages.

I guess it depends on what you mean by "natural level."  Collectively world governments have done all that they can to keep gold from being the currency base.  Were it to go back to being such I have seen a good case for gold rising to the "natural level" of ~$65000/oz.  I personally don't believe this will happen unless people totally lose faith in paper currency.  I hope to never see such an event.
I believe the markets are efficient.  Definitely not rational, but fairly efficient.  Market prices are a very good approximation of what people are willing to pay.  You can emotionally force the level away from where it should be for a time, but it will always eventually snap back to home.

I got into an argument about this with someone on here a couple weeks ago, and they totally blew my mind.  As crazy as it sounds, if transaction fees got high enough ASICMiner could potentially be worth a market Cap higher than actual bitcoins in existence.  Just because something is priced in bitcoins doesn't mean it can't be more valuable than all bitcoins in existence.
For example, right now Apple computer is worth ~4 billion BTC.  We could trade apple stock in btc, and the fact that all the btc in existence couldn't buy all the stock wouldn't matter.

To start with, you need to understand marginal reserves.  A marginal reserve is an existing supply of a commodity that is released as price rises.  For example, as oil has risen in price the past decade it has suddenly become profitable to mine shale oil and tar sands, and all sorts of nasty crude that just wasn't worth refining at a lower price.  In turn this increased supply and the feedback stabilized the price.  
This is the natural supply and demand process for any resource.  McDonalds can't find workers for $8/hr but there is a huge marginal supply at $10/hr, so that is where the wage levels out.  When the Hunt brothers tried to corner the silver market their calculations were wrecked because people came out of the woodwork hocking grandma's tea set for scrap, supplying enough supply that they ran out of money.  Demand Rises --&gt;Price raises --&gt;Supply rises --&gt; Price levels out, this is the natural order of things; every commodity obeys this rule.
Every commodity except bitcoin that is.  It is really unlike anything in history.  If the price goes up 100 fold, you will get 100 fold the mining power devoted to it and zero increase in supply.  That cuts out the normal supply feedback you would receive and allows prices to just keep on rising.  The ONLY marginal reserves are what old timers are willing to sell, and most of them seem to think $10,000+ is a fair price per coin.
This is really novel, and I wonder if Satoshi himself realised the possible implications; I suspect that if he did he may have gone a few orders of magnitude deeper on the divisions.  For now it means rapidly increasing price and possibly increased volitility because this cart is just flat out missing some of it's brakes.  In the not too distant future it could mean valuations that are stupid ridiculous to think about.  Enjoy the ride.

You have a point, but consider:  even when (if?) Bitcoin gets big enough that lots of large transactions are going through every block, it will have gotten popular enough that each individual btc is worth much much more.  Therefore even if transaction fees are getting much larger in value, the bitcoin amount for those fees wont change much.  I will be surprised if fees ever average much more than 1 btc per block.  In a century 1 btc may be a relatively huge deal.  For the next 7 years, not so much.

You are asking questions which I have to answer with guesses and theory, which I don't mind, but I don't have much to back up my opinion.
My gut says there are an awful lot of people sitting on an awful lot of coins hoping to get very rich some day. I think they were the only reason that coins had any value whatsoever for a long time, because supply was actually way lower than what was mined.  I think that since the halving "real" global demand has probably finally outstripped new production.  This probably has more to do with increased demand in the past few months than decreased new supply.
A change in daily production of 3600 coins isn't really that significant compared to the full market size of ~11,000,000.  My guess is that the price is more influenced by people who have big stockpiles.  Any significant level of demand is going to easily swallow the newly mined coins - whether there are 3600 or 7200 per day doesn't much matter.
I'm not saying that new production has no effect on price; of course it does.  I just don't think it is a primary driver any more now that demand is outpacing production.

They will likely just tax the hell out of it.  Profit earned from currency trading is taxed at the normal capital gains tax rate (15% unless you are at a fairly high or low income level).  Gold, on the other hand, is treated by the IRS as a "collectible," and profits are taxed at a 28% luxury rate.  This is a pretty blatant push to discourage gold ownership.  I think that you can expect this type of treatment at a bare minimum.

They won't "decide to cash out" all at once as a synchronous group.  Many have cashed out already, partially or in whole.  Many are cashing out right now and more will in the future.   Every penny the price rises convinces people to sell.   When you run that group out it rises some more.  Remember that every day that more than 3600 net  BTC are purchased there are people selling reserves.   3600 isn't very many in a market like this.   My suspicion is that there have been large holders dumping all year long, keeping the price down.

Yes, there should definitely be a class action for fraud.  I don't see how they could possibly defend saying "shipping in two weeks" when they hadn't even finalized chip design.  There is a lot of court precedent fregarding late delivery when timeliness is important (things like a perfect cake showing up the day after the wedding.  It may be exactly what you ordered, but it is totally useless).  Knowingly claiming a false delivery date is a serious no-no and they will be really lucky if their aren't a few lawyers in the queue with paperwork already filled out to file.

 If you read the whole thread Subduction expects the hashrate to keep doubling every month pretty much forever.  My main point was that he was predicting the bitcoin mining network to have the majority of the computing power in the world sometime towards the end of next year.  
He is still full of shit.  It is easy to gloat about how obviously right you are after your predictions come true, but if he actually was that confident at the time, why didn't he take the bet?

The NSA is supposedly decades ahead of the rest of us for cryptography.  What that truly means is anyone's guess.  The people who truly know are up to their eyeballs in Non-Disclosures and fear of treason charges.  I for one would not be surprised if they were currently capable of an effective attack.  Hopefully before bitcoin makes enough waves to be judged worthy of attack the global hash rate will have gotten so high as to make an attack infeasible.

The idea is that you would spend far far far less computing power mining coins than you would trying to crack them away from someone else.  If you decided  to do it anyway and throw an awful lot of computing power at it you may get really lucky and actually hit an address with something in it before you die (very very unlikely, but here's hoping!)  At this point if someone has foolishly kept all their coins in one wallet you could really harm them.  But really, addresses are free, so why keep all your eggs in one basket.  If you are worried about the infinitessimal chance of an address collision, it is a simple matter to spread your coins out, just in case.

Doubling 6 times at a few months apiece still adds up to a fair amount of time, and sales will slow once asics stop looking so ridiculously profitable.  However, overall network strength is a function off Bitcoin price and hashing power will naturally rise(or fall) until it is barely profitable on an efficient device.
I would guess that the first gen BFL products will be profitable at least until the next halving, maybe not very profitable, but worth running.  Shoot, the radeon 5870 came out nearly 4 years ago, people are still buying those to mine with today.
Remember that asics are the end game.  From here out improvements are incremental, not exponential.

Krugman drives me nuts.  Even when he is absolutely right, sometimes even insightful, he stays blind to the causes of what is happening.  Here he sees the problem of monopolistic pricing regarding apple, but totally misses that apple has a government granted monopoly due to the policies he unfailingly supports.  Every monopoly I can think of is directly caused by government enforced barriers to entry for the competition.  Apple holds theirs through patent abuse.  Disney through copywrite abuse.  Car dealerships through noncompete laws.   Banking, insurance, healthcare, all pushed into huge monolithic conglomerates because a little guy cant handle the burdensome regulation.   Government regulation breeds monopolies.

I think most people grasp the utility of stimulus spending during an economic crisis.  What the status quo never  seems to remember is that you should pay the money back when the crisis ends.  Libertarians simply recognize the reality that elected politicians never have the motivation to return the borrowed money, and therefore in the long run we would probably be better off not tinkering with the economy at all.

There are roughly 10, 000, 000 bitcoins left to be mined and 400, 000 shares.  The math isn't hard.  
That said, it wouldn't surprise me if asicminer found other profitable things to do to improve its value but we need to be realistic.  Valuing asicminer at 52.5 btc puts its market cap at 21 million btc, which is pretty much the absolute limit of what it could possibly be worth since that is how many bitcoins there ever will be.

The United States government may very well make it difficult to use bitcoin by its citizens. There are a number of ways they can do this.  But contrary to the US government's belief, they don't control the world.   For every country that is happy with the Dollar's reserve currency status there are two that hate it.  
It is almost guaranteed that if the US is seriously threatened by bitcoin Russia will promote it out of spite.  It is anyone's guess where China will wind up on the issue, but we know they won't take orders from Washington.   Governments in huge swaths of the world don't have the technological resources to fight it if they wanted to.   
They can try to shut it down.   They may even succeed.  But in trying they run the very real risk of being left behind by the rest of the world.

You know what they say about things that sound too good to be true...  Honestlyi even if this company has the best of intentions they have a very very bad business model.
Imagine you put 10 btc in an account with them at 20%.  In order to cover defaults and turn a profit they loan it back out to a promising startup at 40% interest.  Steep but reasonable right?  So our startup uses that 10 btc to purchase roughly $3000 in goods and services they need to get off the ground.  A year later they are up and running, profitable, and start to make payments on their loan. 
 Bitcoins are now trading at $3000/ea.  Our startup is honest and profitable and in another year they succeed in setting aside enough cash to pay back 8 btc.  Unfortunately in the mean time they have racked up 6 btc in interest and bitcoins have gone up to $25000 Each.  Our startup now owes roughly $200, 000 at 40% interest and another halving is just around the corner so btc starts to rocket in price....  At some point this ends in a defaulted loan.
This rosy scenario (The bank only collecting a fraction of the original loan) is if everyone is honest and reasonably successful.  Likely this "bank" will soon be bankrupt and account holders will be left holding the bag.
Bitcoin is great, but if you are wise you won't get involved with bitcoin denominated debt.  It is too volatile and it will bite you.  Unless you recieve a steady paycheck in a currency, you don't want your contract spelled out in that currency.

I don't know what the reasoning behind this statement is.  There was international trade both before the U.S. government started controlling the price of gold and after it quit.  The gold standard was abandoned because it didn't allow the central banks of the world to adjust rates as they saw fit.


In the decade before the U.S. stopped fixing the price of gold we sold more than half of our reserves.  The continuous inflation of the dollar left little choice; either stop holding gold at $30/oz. or run out our reserve by 1980. [Reference Chart]( 


They justify it by claiming to stimulate the economy by inflation, but in reality they peg inflation below bond rates with the central banks so the governments can inflate away their debt.  Inflation is just a tax in sheep's clothing.


An awful lot can happen in 50 years, and currency devaluations take people by surprise.  As recently as 2002 when Argentina devalued it's currency inflation hit 10.4% **per month**


The dollar has taken the place as gold as the world's reserve currency.  That isn't backed by the military, it is backed by faith that our government will be stable and able to keep inflation low.  It doesn't take much to weaken that faith.  The US Dollar has done well trough the recent economic crisis by being the best of bad options. 
Of course there is much more faith in the U.S. Dollar right now than Bitcoin.  Bitcoin has hardly established a beachhead as a currency.   However, should there ever be an event to shake the faith of the dollar there will be a flight to safety (which is what they were afraid when the outlawed gold ownership when they started to inflate the money supply in the 30's).  Bitcoins could quickly become a real threat.
