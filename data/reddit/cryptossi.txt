A couple of exchanges have closed down over the last few days. Not all have been forcibly shut by the SEC or other regulators. Some have been due to financial reasons. Will this become a trend? Lots of exchanges opened up in 2017-18 and surely not all of them can be profitable or compliant.

BEAR ATTACK
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:33:13
It has been a very underwhelming week.

This is so so so good, I've always made the HODOR/HODL joke with my friends and now it's actually an advert.

$25k is a very safe prediction, I feel like a lot of people use this figure because they're too scared to be bold and actually think for themselves.
@_date: 2018-06-09 14:32:08
yeah exactly and they consume all of our krill sized profits whenever theres a bear market!

Wish I was a whale, I'm more of a prawn.

If only that was true, I'm probably one single krill which is about 2 grams lol.

Considering how other British banks &amp; building societies have turned down business with Coinbase, I would still take this as good news. However you are right it's not an official partnership yet, but hopefully it will be in the future!

I know I've also invested in some Slovenian projects recently, they're killing it at the moment!
@_date: 2018-03-11 12:01:37
I know man, but at least thats it over for Mt. Gox now
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:01:37
I swear Slovenia fucking loves Bitcoin!!!

Looks interesting.. I saw someone talking about this exchange on another bitcoin discussion! I'm definitely going to test it out the next time I need to get some bitcoin.

It's the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), so not a retail bank like Barclays. It's the South African equivalent of the Bank of England &amp; the Federal Reserve Bank in America. The SARB is in charge of implementing monetary policy and printing/issuing banknotes etc.
This article highlights the key points from a consultation paper recently released by SARB about their views on cryptocurrency and future regulation. In the eyes of SARB, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are viewed as 'Crypto Assets' instead of currency. It is actually very crypto-friendly and it's quite a progressive approach to crypto compared to other nations.

Oh and fiat has never been used for tax evasion and terrorist funding, what a fucking joke! 
Forbes is a pile of shite anyway, 99% of it is garbage that bored bankers read on their lunch breaks.

Its great but I hate using rip-off merchants like BitPay that take ridiculous fees!!

To be honest I find the ATMs unnecessary. Real adoption is a working credit/debit card that converts crypto to fiat for payments at a competitive conversion rate. I think the problem is crypto investors look at crypto as an investment, most people I know would be very reluctant to use their ‘investments’ as a payment option for everyday items and services. Especially nowadays as everyone is HODLing and hoping for it to return to ATH’s. Which is weird because I always thought the whole point of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies was to replace conventional fiat currency because of it’s advantageous properties including decentralization, transaction speeds and lower cost.

Maybe the headline of this article is misleading, this isn't FUD. The article comments on a paper written by members of the South African Reserve Bank with their view on the future of Bitcoin and how they think it should be regulated. It's a forward-thinking paper and I actually think it benefits SA Bitcoin investors as it's tax treatment can be argued as being crypto-friendly.

Yeah I work in London and there’s a Bitcoin ATM in a post office near me, sadly in 3 years I haven’t seen anyone use it and I’m in that post office on a daily basis.
@_date: 2018-03-11 12:00:01
Awesome I just had a look, I'm going to test them out and see how it goes!
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:11:45
I just can't believe the price is still dropping, even with all these great news stories that have been released recently!
Hopefully we will see a turnaround in bitcoin's fortunes soon!

Can you use GBP on there?
