Do you know what I like better than this Lamborghini?
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:18:23
Did you know its hacked history?

He had the whole text bolded in size 14 all capitalized saying some weird shit I'd see in YT comments of 9gag 4 years ago.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:28:08
What kinda keyboard or laptop is that
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:24:19
And for that, it’s worth it.

Exactly me. If they aren’t serving my food, I ain’t tipping. Fuck those cafes and tiny restaurants that turns their shitty touch screen payment system towards you to actually pressure you to tip. That is the worst feeling of all time and I never consider tipping them if it happens.

If he didn’t like it, why did his stupid ass sign the terms &amp; conditions at the first place? This is just unfairly blaming the bank. And I don’t even give two shits about banks failing because of crypto in the future. Just everyone that’s stupid enough to be an OP of this post should fall alongside it.

What a shitty click bait title by someone who’s so uneducated.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:22:53
Do they not accept fiat? If so, a yugggge risk and faith in the crypto. If not, which likely is the case, it great too.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:53:38
Oh so you rewrote a meme from last week. How very original of you?
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:59:14
Oh wow good to know that we have a 13 yr old investor.

Is Bitcoin made by aliens... I think not but there are a few arguments on why they should have done it
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:08:54
Another idiot that can’t accept that he’s stupid and stubborn. Inb4 another worthless pathetic comment.
@_date: 2018-03-03 13:21:14
Eyyy this bot still working. I’m proud

It’s bound to happen and if it does, it’s a clear sign that Wall Street has taken over the manipulation and control of BTC price. It will always be around 7k ~ 18k for a long long time and settle around that price while regulations keep getting involved. No 30k, 100k, 1M BTC crypto dream after that. February is gonna be a huge deciding factor imo. Ofc I know only as much as my dog about price predictions though.
@_date: 2018-02-28 06:51:35
An example of a dumb sheep everyone. Don’t be like op.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:16:51
Oh as if I blamed you for it being valid lol ok
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:12:28
It’s going to be $14k by Feb 21. You saw it here first.
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:02:31
? Idiot
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:17:53
Seems like you are one as well
@_date: 2018-02-26 08:08:53
What an amazing bot
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:42:42
This might get downvoted but this is the absolute truth. OP is crying about the things he signed the terms and conditions for which he most likely didn’t even read a sentence of or even have the brain to understand if he even read one sentence of.  Ridiculously stupid.
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:40:11
Because they shorted it. If you are trying to criticize, learn the basics first.

Futures expiring soon
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:01:34
Because you are expecting them to answer in 2 hours idiot.
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:54:50
Oh so it can get stolen
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:14:30
