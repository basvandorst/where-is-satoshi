If corruption is a human thing, is it then wise to centralize it through a monopoly on violence?
I would recommend that you read a book called The Law, written by a french economist named Frédéric Bastiat in 1850 and translated to english later on.
You can read it for free, or buy it on Amazon or something :)

@_date: 2014-09-05 09:45:21
To me, politics died when I watched the republican convention in 2012, getting a nice overview of the bullshit that was going on behind the scene.. 
- Delegates getting sent in a bus that would drive around in circles for hours delaying then..
- Committees started without the committee leaders because of him being trapped on that bus.
- Teleprompters that would have the result of a votecount even before the actual vote..
- Rulechange without the majority.
This really happened as I watched and it fucking broke me... And I ain't even American.....
So basically Ron Paul had the delegate majority in 6 of the 5 state needed to be able to speak for a nomination, but they changed the minimum to 8 right before everyones eyes, without the proper majority.
If Dr. Paul would have gotten his speech, Mr. Romney would have been hauled out of there..
Sure I was/am a serious Paulbot, but IMHO everyone should advocate for the state to leave one the fuck alone..
That still does not legitimize fraud like that. 
But then again; the US government knows all about overthrowing elected officials, eh?
PS: The democratic convention did exactly the same in regards to a question about Jerusalem.. Don't really remember what that was, but maybe someone can remind me..?

Isn't this why one should focus on p2p mining?
@_date: 2014-09-23 01:45:03
What do you mean "never uses single sha256"?
Say the algorithm is flawed in a way that I would not need quantum computing to find a private key from a public key, but an ordinary laptop instead in a few seconds using a certain opposing algorithm. I know this is just a hypothetical thing, but strong things have been broken by less in the past. 
Yes, I would also need to decrypt a lot of password secured keys as well, but not everyone has this security and it would be fast to just do a trailback of the keys and empty them as I went.
This would be quite pointless to do though, since if you have found a flaw like that the entire network is done for.
Basically Bitcoin and I would guess all the alcoins as well does have a single point of failure and that is the algorithm in the currency itself.
It's a big "what if" as well and I'm just wondering from a information security perspective.
What I want from this is basically to know if it exists any emergency contingency plan, and does it invole anything other than to escape to another system like we are escaping the governmental financial systems of today (at least thats what many libertarians would like)?
I love the idea behind crypto currency, but I just don't trust human truths that much.

I just really don't get it.. I mean if I compare this to any other market I don't think it has been ever a thing that the merchant is asked to burn some of his money at the marketplace before they can trust him. That to me feels like a way to build fake trust.. 
IE: sure I would burn some money if they would throw more money than that after me again thinking they can trust me.
And what about those who are new to this whole thing and do not have btc to begin with? How so they have less trust?

Well ok:
The founder of litecoin (if I'm correct) has been very open about the coin. He has explained that he has done only a few changes to it; Decrease blocktime to make it go faster and a similar increase in amount of coins to compensate for this. And he also changes the algorithm from sha256 to scrypt. This he has said, only needed the change of a few lines of code from the Bitcoin source code. 
He announced the launch public way in advance so that as many as possible could join in on the mining from day one as well! 
But don't take my word for it: 
Peace :)
