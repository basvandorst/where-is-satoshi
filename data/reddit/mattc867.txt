Lol u should have sold at 18 tho

Yeah it could be bad - or it could level out and hold. I’m really curious to see how CME going live with futures on 10Dec affects everything.

at least all the inside traders at Coinbase are getting screwed too

Hah ok I misunderstood.  I agree lots of people jumping on the train have no real idea what Bitcoin is.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:56:52
Yes. A cash transfer would not be affected.

There were news reports of people going into debt to invest in Bitcoin. That's when I sold what I had.  Not saying I know where it'll level out but it was pretty obvious a correction was coming.

Could be. Cap gains tax isn’t changing though.  Changes to income tax code are hit/miss depending on circumstances- wouldn’t expect a massive sell off to squeeze into this calendar year.

Because something in the middle doesn't exist...

What about a kiloSatoshi?  /s

Total noob here so maybe this is a dumb question - feel free to ignore.  But, to me, too much decentralization seems like a barrier to scalability - how to make sure everyone agrees on changes when you have so many parties?  Seems like some centralization would be necessary to actually implement improvement and not just argue it to death.

\*\*eyeroll\*\* 
Debate on the merits of the paper (their arguments and statistical rationale) are great \- but to suggest a researcher from U Texas is part of "MSM FUD" is taking the whole skeptical approach to the news a bit too far in the other direction, don't you think?
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:46:47
John Griffin is not MSM and the paper was just published today. You’re reading between lines that don’t exist.

LOL I thought it was a good segment for the average person.  The take home message for people new to alt-coins (and crypto in general) should be 'be careful'.  I was a little surprised there was no mention of ETH,LTC,ect. but, if his message is just 'be careful' then people will figure all that out on their own anyway.
