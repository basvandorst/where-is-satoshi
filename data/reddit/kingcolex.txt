Never leave funds on an exchange.
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:15:54
No but leaving funds on exchanges gives no benefit. We know they get hacked or go insolvent all the time. Buy a fucking trezor and use it.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:09:44
Is it a wallet on coinbase? If you purchase Bitcoin on coinbase then you have to send it to your own wallet on your desktop. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:03:22
Then you are day trading and should either be comfortable with that amount being higher risk or seek another solution such as more secure exchanges.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:21:35
Use exchanges that haven't been hacked previously, don't leave amounts you aren't willing to lose on exchanges, don't be a greedy fuck and need to trade on the minute.

I have already downloaded brave and I really like it, I can't wait to browse and get paid to.
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:36:33
I used to use coinbase but they went to shit after the price increase and their userbase growing. I can't get them to fix their bank adding system. Their customer service still hasn't responded. I mean I have bought and sold ar with these people  and I can't get shit done. I said fuck this and opened a Gemini account and couldn't be happier.

They'll push an altcoin called Bitcoin cash there, this is not true Bitcoin

@_date: 2018-09-03 11:04:48
Being on the exchange, I'm pretty sure this is to slowly buy a mix of alts, bring them to multiple exchanges, change to more alts and then slowly bring it back to btc on an exchange where they can pull fiat.
If you are fbi OP , your only shot is contacting the exchange directly which I am sure you have, and hoping they can either seize the coins or follow the supply, follow those coins to the other exchanges and hope he pulls fiat.
Edit:Now that I think of it a mix of alts directly to fiat would be better and harder to track.  It wouldn't hurt his fiat value of the btc either since he's only buying and selling the alts, he's not going to be dumping btc and can spread it over many markets instead of just btc.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:08:50
Of course that and the statement that "bitcoin.com CEO dumping bitcoins" yeah fucking obvious. The Bitcoincash team should be ashamed for this bullshit.

Oh I'm sorry lets look at history of payment processors like western union and PayPal. Nothing can go wrong. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 16:48:33
So if the community can't decide to raise the blocksize with ease how do you think they'll decide which chain to push for and have processors accept.
@_date: 2015-06-19 02:17:56
Another to switch from cash to Bitcoin I assume.
@_date: 2015-06-01 19:58:15
No clue, no word on twitter yet.
@_date: 2015-06-13 16:26:52
Total bullshit, so you think the key to Bitcoin is payment processors.
@_date: 2018-09-03 05:35:47
And why would they want to do that? Tons of money comes from btc via jobs, trades, industries, imports and the Tom's of taxes paid. The US Government is not going to give up on a silicon valley 2.0
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:27:46
I am going to be down voted but it's true, if you are wanting an instant transfer speed where you can spend it instantly you should check Dash.
@_date: 2015-06-13 15:15:23
Sidechains, instead of focusing on market acceptance lets confuse the fuck out of everyone.
Seriously how do you expect to get companies who are reluctant to accept Bitcoin to accept the flavor of the month sidechains.
Sidechains are essentially altcoins if the idea is for microtransactions, they could eventually prove good for things like loans, proof of ownership and other things but not for dealing with blocksize and increasing Bitcoin usage/acceptance.
We need to not fool ourselves, sidechains are just like an altcoins as the developer makes the rules, but most will be centralized to peg price. Centralized chains is not what we need, an increased blocksize and utilizing this sidechain technology for specific transactions  is what me need.
@_date: 2015-06-10 21:46:42
Its more like buying a gift card in my eyes and following their rules of use and being able to get the btc back when wanted
@_date: 2015-06-19 02:18:54
Yes you can use multiple. I have Bitcoin, litecoin and Dash on my single trezor.
@_date: 2018-08-04 17:55:54
So they are but they'll be using a pyament processor that exchanges it to fiat. Plenty of places that accept btc have it convert to fiat on the back end.
Aka yes you will go to Starbucks with only btc and leave with a coffee.
@_date: 2015-06-13 17:04:52
Blockstream make the technology but can't dictate who uses it. I doubt governments will be jumping to make sidechains,  especially when pegged to Bitcoin.
So lets get this straight the idea to fight the worry of centralization from a higher blocksize (which isn't proven) is to adopt centralized sidechains and get governments and other third parties like payment processors involved.
Good fucking idea, if Bitcoin goes this path I will be stacking something else. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 21:49:50
From sidechain? Well the side chains are backed by the value of bitcoin, so possibly to hold and invest and sidechains will mostly be centralized, so to not keep your money in their rules.

@_date: 2015-06-19 13:12:57
Well it's easy, download electrum for ltc and it makes a wallet off the trezor and download encompass for Dash. Btc has a couple options so its up to you.

You make an account on an exchange Coinbase or gemini and you deposit funds via a bank or debit card and you transfer the bought coin to your wallet. I suggest electrum.org or better yet take $150 out of the coin and buy a hardware wallet Trezor.

It runs a pruned node of the lightning network preconfigured, If you were running it on your phone it wouldn't be a real node but a connection to someone else's server, this being yours personally makes it a bit safer. 
That and it makes it simple, that's the biggest boon.

This is why we fight the disinformation campaign from the BCH group. You aren't alone, I never redeemed my paper wallets so I'm not sure but if you have a prefork wallet the address may have carried over, if they weren't valid they should come back if I understand correctly.

There are quite a few things:

2: No fees 
3: no wallet required and insured
We also will see withdraws just not yet
@_date: 2018-05-04 12:10:39
Well it is insured so if Robinhood has some sort of breach of the crypto they hold you are covered. 
Now it is going to allow withdraws I think this will be after the state rollout though.

@_date: 2018-05-04 12:12:09
I believe they have an internal exchange happening, or it's off chain relocation out of their pool of coins. They probably buy more coins if buy orders go in that makes demand over their supply.

Okay but the analogy doesn't work in any sense, Satoshi isn't Caesar neither is Brutus and Caesar trusted Brutus because he was banging his mom and was possibly even Brutus's father. 
The point your trying to make is just because Satoshi trusted Theymos isn't a good enough reason and I somewhat agree but I don't see him doing anything wrong. He's human and falliable but has done a great job.

First it is an exchange and you shouldn't keep money there, secondly everyone knew gox was known for cutting withdrawals without warning, third there was warning from people saying to split from gox and fourth it is an exchange not a bank people shouldn't have kept their money there. I don't expect reporters to be all lovey dovey allover bitcoin right now but to say "its back is against the way struggling to survive" or "bitcoin is offline" or bitcoins CEO is missing is just wrong and pure lies, it is a pretty simple thing to report. An exchange in Tokyo without warning closed down and it seems they stole funds, they're blaming a bug that has been known since 2011 and hasn't been an issue for other exchanges except for some doing maintenance to fix the issue.

I am assuming double spending, too low amount and probably no fee took to long to get on the Blockchain, thus fuckfaces double spend and steal from a bundle for charity. Bitcoin is no longer the best option for digital cash until changes are made and we know this, we need to either accept that and allow something else fill that void and focus on settlements or make changes.

Even if it is compromised it doesn't have any say to do anything, unless you live in an area with mass open network connections, have the phone powered on, no pass code, no signal blocker and people able to either physically get your device or somehow do a Bluetooth attack they aren't going to be able to get online. If they can physically steal this they could probably physically steal a trezor too and either find your seed words or bruteforce the 4 digits.
Remember these phones are pass code lockable and storing them in a full connection blocking bag is super cheap and they aren't going to be powered on unless your most likely sweeping.

It is how verizon works, with the signals you can activate the phone (it is only cellular  and doesn't accept calls or make them, except to possibly 911) No data packets are transmitting anywhere and you can always airplane mode as well for added precaution.
Since it is verizon there is no simcard, wifi does need to be turned off asap to avoid an autoconnect to open wifi issue.

Well I don't think the point is to be staring at a wallet screen. It is more a less a super paper wallet, it can generate as many as needed, hide behind a pass code and take a screen shot. I would say leaving it powered on would be rare, it is more a generate key, screen shot public key to a fresh micro SD. Load screen shot off micro SD to phone or PC and send funds as needed. Device stays off and in a safe, l believe it could also act as a more secure (but not cold storage) mobile wallet. Where you keep it with you and use it to pay for things by connecting it to your main phones hotspot mode and disconnecting it immediately. With no other apps and an extremely short time connected to the internet it is safer than 90% (number pulled out of my ass) of other wallets.

You need to use an altcoin for a small transaction, Bitcoin is more of an investment tool and has been for a while. It is essentially like you were using a 10th of a gram of gold to buy things and mad it cost you a 200th as a fee. Bitcoin isn't the daily driver currency and it's obvious we went away from that ( or we would have large blocks and almost no fees with 2 minute block times).

And who will give loans in crypto? You really think there will be debt or credit? How delusional are you? I have been in crypto for a long time but you're playing fantasy land and it's pathetic. There will always be a banking system because there will always be a need for it, if somehow it becomes decentralized fine but it would still just be a bank with algorithms controlling credit and all approvals and certain users profiting off it. (Just how those who invest in DEX profit off them now)

@_date: 2019-01-19 13:31:00
You're saying it's a meme not and trying to play it off but in you're other replies you were being more straight faced. Cool move, now like I said you would still need a banking system, if other crypto users give each other loans what rating system would they use? Now would you want to use a private company that does all this and researches into the identity, income, payment rate of person or just a forum post where Buttlicker_36 says he needs 25 Bitcoin to buy a house and will repay over 30 years and a set going rate. Now we expect people to still need to make large purchases right? Homes won't go away, but other crypto users aren't going to want to be on the hook for 30 years of having someone repay there would have to be a middleman. This is just screaming a third party company (one you could essentially call a bank, especially since they would be under traditional financial rules) or we can pretend it would be some sugar coated fairytale system.
Listen you may just be memeing but there are too many fools who don't understand what crypto is or how it's going to be evolve. Too many young users who have never used a bank for anything but a checking account with a debit card.
Crypto is a big fucking deal and we have to be responsible and very careful with what developments and planned changes we go with crypto.
Memeing a private key in cold storage is all we need to replace a bank is just ignorant and pretty much underestimating the massive technologies the crypto scene will have to develop to reach any sort of % of traditional banking users.

I have posted this many times in pcmasterrace, it isn't miners. The issue is Nvidia and AMD have realized they can artificially limiting supply and make a whole lot more in profits. You see GPU makers would have already be cutting prices to keep people buying instead of holding out for the next generation. Currently people are posting deals as $100 over MSRP and excited to jump on them. They act like an MSRP card is winning the lotto. Nvidia is most likely even going to delay the 11 series, we know they aren't worried about Vega and AMD is able to sell and be competitive with nvidias supply method they love it too. The best part is they get no blame it's all the miners and cryptocurrency taking the blame.

You haven't dealt with large wires often that's pretty obvious. Now let's say your wiring money for closings they can block or hold up your money if it seems suspicious to them at all. This means you might be buying properties in a run down area to turn into government section 9 housing, they may just see multiple $50,000 wires to a Detroit area and have preconceived ideas on the area and block the transaction. You now aren't able to close in time and pay per diem and have to adjust a contract. Shit happens constantly.

So gold could drop to 3$ an ounce since it has the same properties as copper for electronic use but that's where the intrinsic value stops? There is no reason for gold to logically be where it is at except it has been the standard storage of wealth forever and probably will always be worth something but the intrinsic value is not there.

When it's not and results in a contract having to be redone. They don't even need to have a solid reason or let you know, there's a lot of issues when it comes to transferring funds and the hold time and delay. For close to end of life for contracts this wait time can be BRUTAL and be deal breakers.
Paying bills can even be a pain if it's dealing with importing goods. It's not all smiles and sunshine in the banking world regardless of how much you dislike or don't see a reason for crypto.

I don't voted because you don't understand what you're on about, there is a reason this is on Bitcoin.com
Imagine this was any other product or service. Imagine for a minute this was an iphone, it came out years ago but is just really taking off. 
This guy comes around buys iPhone.com makes a competitor at first known as iPhone cell, then they go ahead and quitely drop the cell and are selling it as iPhone on their site and call the original iPhone , iPhone call.
Except we also have known issues of ver paying to sabotage Bitcoin by spamming it to try and prove the need for his coin. There is no oh it provides use, the best thing Bitcoin cash has done is unite the original block fighters. We now have 2mb blocks with segwit (4mb essentially) and lighting network on the heels. 
Ver is the one who really hurt his coin by now making it unneeded, now he tries and trick use.
Gavin almost had a fork of 30mb or so blocks and there was a battle but nothing so foolish like this.

I don't think you're understanding me, I don't think gold is actually going to decrease in value like that but what I am saying is the reason it truly holds value is due to it being a standard of wealth not it's engineering or electronic use. (I hold precious metals as well as bitcoin)

I would be able to show people how easily you can secure coins and send my mom a paper wallet to hold to, I would make multi part wallets for joint deals with my buddy such as for our YouTube donations that we have to both work together to withdrawal and finally I would get use out of the laminator I bought my wife for Christmas and she hasn't opened! 
@_date: 2016-05-01 03:36:52
You know, I was super into the openpandora because at the time it was something totally unique. It was that and GPX and not much else. This seems WILD but not in a good way, it is arm based and not amazing hardware for half a grand.  Honestly the internals could easily be replaced with a $50 Odroid-C2 for extremely similar performance. A 7inch screen is around $30, the shell and their controller can't cost more than $30 and the battery is 1715mah a 2000mah is $12 resale in America. They seem to really be either buying a far too expensive motherboard or marking it up far too much. This isn't the old days when open pandora was revolutionary for emulation. This is just overpriced imo.
@_date: 2016-05-01 16:07:25
I mean you don't have to mod the case physically for the keyboard : 
 but if you mean the time it takes to flash the hardware I mean that seems like it is currently the better route than paying ~$600 usd (may be more with shipping to us) than a gpd xd or even 2 of them for $300 in total and have them ship to you today rather than hoping everything works out and your preorder isn't stuck in production hell. That and we all know not to preorder when dealing with bitcoin, plenty have learned that due to the fact of trying to get it back if something goes wrong. The time it takes for hoping it ships and what not and the $300 extra you save definitely seems worth the time or less time in total.
EDIT: Didn't even know about the GPD win, honestly an x86 platform in a nice setup like that for $300 if you do the preorder, seems like a better option especially if you are going for a "full pc that fits in your pocket" then X86 is obviously the way to go. I am assuming you must be involved somehow with this project because you are very adamant  about defending them at every post rather then a normal consumer saying "look at this cool thing you can buy in bitcoin"

Although this could easily be remedied with an LTE hotspot that are pretty damn portable and give lte access to all your devices and stats of how much data used. It would mean another gadget to have in your pocket but popping it in your car and taking it with you for a commute doesn't seem bad at all.

Yeah I suggest stamping them on copper tags while using a passcode method. An extra letter at the top right of the tag, have it organized to make a word (your password) to have the correct order of the words.

I know they're totally different but people call them either one of those two on every piece of bitcoins news.

Thank Galactus us green people haven't been targeted with this blatant racism yet.

You're being ridiculous, there is no reason to start hiding all hardware wallets out of phobia, they can adapt to only be used by the intended user but don't need to be camouflaged

Also a libertarian here who has a similar issue with friends and family, funny enough I'm also from Tulsa. I was going to go I'm on a decent priced miner with some friends but I ended up going alone to keep the drama out of it, I realized this is a hobby I can't discuss with too many people because they just jump to conclusions and call it a pyramid scheme or say the US will shut it down, and refuse to listen to my logic refuting it. I think people are just very anxious about money but I can't stand the ignorance from friends.

If the difficulty increases too high and price doesn't  ill use it for an all coin with sha256, I'm not worried about it and more in it for  hobby and also the pi and USB hub can always be used for anything.

How would it be impractical? Running it on a 4 watt ouya would be practical.

Its to btcguild for an asic miner costing .35 coin I have .3500440 in my wallet. I received the coins and my part has been working so far so well I updated a while a go.

Not currently much now due to car tag and wife's birthday this month but a little bit, I just haven't purchased bitcoins yet and still looking into it.
@_date: 2013-08-30 20:56:55
Well I'm using a super low power mining set up with a pi as my PC and a powered USB hub using 12 watts an hour and then the extra watts from the miner. At current hash rate it should net me .08 a coin a month this running for a year will get me .98 a coin and cost 11$ for electricity for an entire year. So it will gain me profit and for each extra I add it'll be an extra .98 a coin and 2.36 in power for a year. So it will pay for itself even if difficulty increases.

I actually own this application prior to the Reddit post, it's a CPU miner no gpu.

There's a huge difference between charing a tablet (which I don't and probably wouldn't ever do) at work and a segway especially after being told not to.

Both are speculative, we might see some terahashes drop if the price goes below 100 as people think they won't make their powers worth or they lose faith in btc, or that people will not renew their mining contracts since they only used the btc for sr.

I didn't know address to address has an transaction fee. How much is it ? I have .35004400 I'm guessing that's not enough. But idk where to get a dollar in bitcoins in short notice =\
@_date: 2013-09-05 19:45:16
I was looking at fans any idea on their wattage?
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:01:08
Definitely good for altcoins and scrypt mining. Now bitcoin mining this is obsolete.
@_date: 2013-07-17 16:27:22
I like the idea but I highly doubt it will make 100000$ especially only at 250$ in two days.
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:16:30
BTW don't go on the wild roller coaster known as the park slide. It has such a wild drop.
@_date: 2013-05-23 20:50:45
Thank you for the concern but I would most definitely not do that. I was just wanting to see as more or less an experiment.
@_date: 2013-05-28 18:17:50
I think because it's not profitable for android mining and I guess others think it's a dumb question. But I was wondering because with these more and more powerful android devices and the ease to solar charge or quick charge them They might have a future at bitmining.

Not much at all, it's not a profit thing it's a project thing to see how high of a hash rate we could get on phones. I was reading a 15mh/s from a nexus four and a 40-50mh/s from a nexus 7

Thanks man, currently I've been selling the wow gold to my guildies for a lower than average rate and its safer that way. Usually making about 100$ a month, I have a friend who's father mines coins and I can buy from him locally now all I should really need is the cheapest site or a redditor willing to sell an erupter once I have the coins

10 Celsius is quite a lot how do you suggest cooling it that much?
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:34:33
If you're smart you'll do the EXACT opposite, especially if it does drop.

That's what apple has always done, that's one of the original strong points android had when it keep into the scene. It had only a fraction of apps but it didn't limit you. Now today its got everything and the marketplace isn't restricted (except for certain things )
