LN devs are not bitcoin devs. They're building LN for any blockchain that will use it. 
I'm stunned by the lack of concern on this thread that bitcoin fees are beginning to spike at the bottom of a bear market.  It seems like everyone on this thread except OP is willing to watch bitcoin crash and burn under the management of ideological radicals.

Here's the only proof that matters:
1. Decentralization serves censorship resistance.
2. My transactions are not being censored. 
QED: Bitcoin is decentralized. 
QED: You're wrong, no matter how many times you move the goalposts.
