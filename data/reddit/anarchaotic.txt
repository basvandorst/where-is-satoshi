Isn't it crazy that someone speaking like that is so accepted that you had to double back to check for sarcasm? 
My favorite is "Recycling CPU/GPU power" - let the poors play Crysis!

How much BTC do you have? If BTC went up in price since the time you sent it, then obviously you'll see more.

How did you send it? That's insane.

We at 11.5K, if it drops below 10K then it'll be a fucking firestorm of sells

Yeah I read that - I just mean you should do it sooner rather than later. I did a few days ago so now I'm really only playing with my unrealized profits.

Even coinsquare has lower fees than Quadriga, would not recommend their 0.5% trade fees.

I'm not familiar with Jaxx. Did it transfer into your intended wallet? Make sure the amount matches up, but it looks like you just paid 0.02BTC for it.

Move it to Gdax - switch it to LTC or ETH, transfer to another exchange.

If quick speeds and low fees are what you're looking for, do you also use LTC?

Imagine HODLing since late November (A single month WOW!) and panic selling to grab those sweet sweet gainz (30%!!!!!). 
Truly a visionary
