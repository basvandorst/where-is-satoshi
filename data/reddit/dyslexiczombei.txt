We're just running them nekkid as the day they were soldered. Seems to help with temps.
We were holding off on .97 until we had more feedback or even a .98, since the .97 feedback so far has been a mixed bag.

Wherever you are, you bloody genius(es): **Thank you!**
I'm so excited to be active in the BTC mining community in this time and space. 
I've created relationships and exclusive deals with fellow miners and manufacturers that have led to what appears to be the biggest and by far, most active, miners Group Buys Cooperative on the BTC Talk Forum in only 2.5 months: the DZ Miners Cooperative - 
Along with my partners, we essentially created part time jobs out of thin air that pays in BTC commissions from BTC mined (we just passed $100K in sales).
We're in talks with a few big investors to create a pro cloudhashing arm of our operations, and we're planning on eating cex.io's lunch (and the other GH exchanges too). For our at-cost or below-cost Group Buys: we currently beat their prices by 39% with the same Bitfury chips and the host fees aren't even close.
Can't imagine I'd be doing this today just 3 months ago. Thanks to Bitcoin and with worthy and talented partners, a hardworking guy like me can create a real part time job out of thin air simply by hustling and being innovative!

It makes about as much sense as saying: can you ban the TCP/IP protocol? 
What about banning the SMS protocol?
You're talking about an ever changing set of standards and politicians that seem to want to tread carefully so as *not* to kill a potential golden goose.
It'd be akin to the US trying to ban the HTTP and HTTPS protocols in the early days of the web. You could do it but then you'd shoot yourself in the foot &amp; watch the rest of the world pass you buy and earn taxes from the jobs &amp; commerce created.

At this moment in ASIC development: there are absolutely no trusted large businesses involved in selling ASIC mining hardware. I see Texas Instruments sells ASICs (which could be the chips we're seeing for ASX Project) but I'm unsure if these ASICs do SHA-256 Hashing.
To pre-order at this time with *any* ASIC hardware mfg. is to take a leap of faith. The only 3 mfg. that are shipping or have shipped: BFL, Avalon, and ASIC Miner.
BFL has the largest sales volume but they're still not even a mid sized biz when you're talking about international corps. ASIC bitcoin miners are about as niche as it gets when it comes to niche electronics.
Slightly OT: If you're buying bitcoins themselves I do recommend Coinbase (1% fee, links to checking acct. but takes 1 week) or BTCQuick if trying to convert CC into BTC. BitInstant is how a lot of folks convert cash to BTC.

Me helping you out on the workload. 
I've been vetting folks for free as Group Buy Coordinators and Bitcoin Miner Hosts. Since I do Info Security as one of my many hats at work, I think I have much, much more training at spotting scams, phishing attempts, &amp; vetting IDs then the avg. person (even if I willingly sent a 12.5 BTC "bet" to ASX Project and ended up w/ the  sidebar FAQ in Reddit BTC Mining subreddit:  ).
I think I've already helped reduce your workload in that respect in that you don't have to vet everyone that is interested in trying to organize or coordinate Group Buys.  In about a month, I've had 7 different people pass my vetting process so far. I even go so far as to probe social media links and check public criminal records. 
I have to be sure when I vet these guys as I tend to work closely with many of the people I vet.
My niche is the Group Buys and Custom Hardware forum and I've helped out people like Barntech of Drillbit systems in the past, here and there.
I was naive enough to think I could've helped Yifu from Avalon, with Customer Service when he came out of so-called "mafia hiding" since he hates customers &amp; I happen to love customers and my fellow humans, in general. I reached out to him via PM w/ my credentials (which you've seen). He just ignored me like everyone else; which is another reason (reason  why he and Avalon are banned from my miners co-op along with BFL.
**TL;DR:** Been taking a back seat on recent co-op Group Buys, I would love to help you, help the Group Buy forums, if you'd like.

IMO I think mining needs to continue to be in there. You have to leave the mining in the video as that's integral to the growth and continued adoption of Bitcoin as it's the only reason all those coins exist for use in the first place!
I think that you only take out the part about mining *once* every Bitcoin has been mined (which is slated to be next century unless we mine them quicker. You take out the part about mining (which mines coins that already exist cryptographically but are waiting to be discovered in the future), and now we're just back to printing money at the Fed.
Perhaps a new emphasis on new ways to buy/sell/transfer Bitcoins esp. including smartphones?

We intend to make it free and Open Source so that it benefits *all miners* that do remote monitoring of their equipment.
I was going to list it there but that 5% fee is something we can pass on to the programmer for more support. 
If I was brand new to the ASIC mining community I would take this route for this OSS Project but I'm just going to list it myself since I'm a trusted Group Buy Coordinator of the Bitcoin Talk Group Buys forum:

I bought 13 of their shares &amp; it appreciated quite a bit since yesterday. Their shares seem to pay out more then interest fees on BTC &amp; at this moment, their share price is currently outgrowing BTC price which is where most of my 1 day gains show up.

Yes, we're still still moving forward with all 6 Group Buys, in fact, -R- has tracking numbers on his KnC Jupiters, inbound. 
We were going to do this news page eventually, but moved up our plans, with this long outage. I wouldn't be surprised if other BTC Talk Forum members continue to do the same.

BTC rose in value 12% since we did our down payment 5 days earlier. 
I'd have to be a dumb and blind to ignore the obvious cost savings to my ultra slim margins as the co-op's Coordinator. These are at-cost shares &amp; I was able to pass on the savings *and* 9% extra hashrate since selling 91 shares out of 100 was enough to  buy the miner &amp; some UPS protection.
It wasn't meant to be an abuse of the system, and this is the 7th Industrial class ASIC Rig I've purchased for us from 4 different mfgs. This is the only Rig where I did a re-order.

It's worked out well for me so far. The 2nd day out of Beta a few weeks ago, I bought 13 shares at .39 (was over 1 last I checked) &amp; you also get mcxfees. :)
mcxFee has done even better than BTC over the last few weeks. They even pay out all these alt-coins I'm not even sure what to do with except to let 'em add up &amp; convert them to BTC later.

I'm sorry to hear that you have to go through this. The nail that sticks out, tends to get hammered down.
In the last 3 months I've done about $60K worth of ASIC hardware purchases and sales on ebay &amp; the Bitcoin Talk Forums. I run an at-cost (and below-cost) Miners Cooperative that gives people access to the best ASIC values (read: most expensive miners) at double and triple digit USD price points. 
When I have a client/wallet that *can* sign transactions, I *always* custom sign my transactions so that there's no confusion or controversy over how the co-op's or my Bitcoin was spent.
People are always scared of things that are "new" or things that seem to come from "outside" their life bubble. We, as Bitcoin early adopters/entreprenuers, just need to power through this. 
As long as you aren't buying from Silk Road 2.0 or trying to hire a hitman using BTC over Tor, I don't think anyone has too much to worry about.

I sold my July pre-orders for 2 Jallys in August on ebay with a small markup. I applied that money, and another in-hand Jally sale to 25% or 100-125GH/s of a HashFast Group Buy:  
**I essentially traded 15GH/s of BFL hashrate (5GH/s in hand) for 100-125GH/s in late October.** They also have a Miner Protection Plan that looks like it'll be triggered so they ship 2-4X chips that'll result in 200-500GH/s from that original 15GH/s. Arbitrage kicks ass. :)

Hi Senator Moran,
Thank you for your time and interest. I would like you to know that we're falling behind China in this important new economic innovation.
I run a Bitcoin Miners Cooperative and a Bitcoin ATM services company. I can tell you that the messy patchwork of state and federal laws surrounding cryptocurrencies is *strongly* making our company founders consider opening an international subsidiary...just so we can get legitimate cryptocurrency businesses.
We *want* to pay our fair share of taxes to support this great country, but the barriers to entry for new businesses trying to enter this space. We love our country and are trying our darnedest to do what's right and fair.

A few suggestions, since I seem to have a knack for helping noobs:
- There's the Bitcoin faucets. They're slow but people do make milli-BTC from this (I'm guessing a milli-BTC will be worth a lot not too far off)
- Sign up on Bitcoin Talk Forum and advertise for one of the merchants there like inputs.io, which pays up to 0.3 BTC a month for having an active account on that forum. I received 0.12 BTC last month, basically for just hanging out and doing my thang: At-Cost/Below-Cost Group Buys of Industrial Class ASIC rigs.
- Deposit it at mcxnow. I've been there since Day 2 (after the Beta).
They pay interest on deposits every 6 hours by sharing 25% of the fees generated by the exchange with their customers. This rate varies around 3-40% lately, and can fluctuate wildly.

No, they couldn't. Please don't spread FUD.
I run the biggest Miners Cooperative on the Bitcoin Talk Group Buys forum. Since I'm involved in the Mining industry and deal w/ ASIC mfgs. such as HashFast, Bitmine, and Black Arrow, among others, I can tell you that deliverable hashrate is going to be slim pickings for the next month or two.
So: where pray tell is this powerful country supposed to get their hands on miners that could supposedly take over the BTC network (which is hundreds of times more powerful than supercomputers) when ASIC chips in quantity, which don't grow on trees, can't be bought no matter how much money you have?

I'm getting the feeling ebay/PayPal may be a house divided when it comes to either taking on BTC or trying to adopt it. Whatever's going on, I'm sure there's concern because they wouldn't have released the vid if there were no concerns. For myself: I want BTC to take their lunch &amp; stomp PayPal. I don't like 'em.
Note how they asked us what we thought with that video they released...but there was nowhere on that video page for us to leave any feedback!
Gee ebay/Paypal: Thanks for asking for our opinions on BTC &amp; then making it difficult for us to express our opinions. &lt;/s&gt;

We've got at-cost and below-cost Group Buy shares currently open on a Bitmine Rig and Black Arrow Bullet Run Bitfury Boards 3 months before Prosperos launch in late February with Black Arrow 100GH/s Minion chips.
Bitmine is Round 8. Black Arrow Bullet Run thanks to bobsag3 is Rounds 9 and 10.
They're selling for $60 and $123 for 1/100th of the machine's hashrate, respectively.
I daresay that if you want to take fractional risk on partial ownership of Industrial Class ASIC rigs (with the very best values only at the top end) we have the very best ASIC deals in the world, bar none (unless you've got tens of thousands of dollars to spend by yourself).

This is a good sign for Bitcoin's long term growth and adoption.
If China, our country's largest competitor, refuses to kill the new golden goose of job creation/taxation, I think it'll make it much harder for the US to attempt to make the Bitcoin protocol or other cryptocurrencies illegal.
Since we don't seem to have much innovation in Washington DC, I'm guessing that when Congress finally gets around to addressing Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, that they'll take a look at how other countries like Germany and China have created policies to deal with this game changer.

Hi mhuzaifa,
I'm a Group Buy Coordinator on the BTC Talk Group Buys forum. I sell at-cost or below-cost fractional ownership for miners which offer the best values in ASIC hardware. Here's the most recent Group Buy we finished (or nearly finished): 
**Our Bitcoin economy needs automated BTC escrow services with full insurance for the full amount of the BTC escrow.** 
I'm a BTCrow Escrow Affiliate (not a full Escrow Agent) but my transactions performed there are limited to only $500 insurance per transaction. 
That's nice but if I were to attempt to set up a fully insured $50K escrowed buy at BTCrow, I'd have to set up 100 separate transactions to try to get insurance!
I'd say a reliable, fully ensured, automated (or as close to automated as possible) online Escrow Service is in dire need if our small BTC economy is to take off.
@_date: 2013-10-10 22:50:36
Seems fair to me. Good for them for looking out for their customers.
@_date: 2013-09-12 21:43:34
You're lucky to have those Avalons! So many customers are still waiting for their units. I even know of people that *still* haven't gotten their B1 units *or* a refund.
However, as you probably already know: the problem with your operating costs is that you're running 110nm first gen ASICs. By being first to market, Avalon's product was always technically inferior as far as power efficiency compared to what would soon follow. By going to a smaller chip size, incredible efficiency gains follow due to the intrinsic improvements made from going smaller (and signals needing to travel less distance). Essentially, they can cram more transistors on the chip to do more work while still gaining major power efficiency.
For example: Avalons use 10W per GH or about 625 Watts total.
In comparison - depending on overclocking - a HashFast Baby Jet will have 4-6X the HashRate of a Gen1 Avalon while only using 0.65W per GH or about 400 Watts total. [Disclaimer: I own 1/4th of a HF B1 pre-order]
Also in the 28nm realm: Cointerra claims 0.55W per GH &amp; new contender Bitmine with Coincraft ASICs is claiming 0.35W per GH and currently have the title of the claimed lowest power draw per GH.
If it was me: I would've sold one as soon as I got it to lock in profits &amp; kept running the other one to mine.

WTF is a genius anyway? I just tested above a certain threshold as a child at approximately 1.4x my mental age (tested as 142 on the Stanford-Binet Scale). You then get put in a box (the "shiny kids") and have all these high expectations planted on you.
BTW, I started the co-op months ago originally to *keep* people away from scams, so they don't have to write expensive FAQ sidebar threads like this: 
We're already paying out and half of our 11 TH of miners are installed.
I'm not going anywhere BTW. I'm in this for the long haul. 
Also, John K. Escrow and about 12 different co-op members/leaders know exactly where I live and work (I even offered to team up with him). I live on Kauai. Since I have a family and deep roots here: Why the F would I run anywhere else if I can build a business from home on Kauai that I'm building as a dominant operator in Robocoin Operator Network?

Thanks for your input! 
Hi everyone,
Wow, this Group Buy has escalated quickly. Thank you everyone for your input, your concerns, and pre-orders.
I can report that the we've filed for Corporation Status in the state of Nevada. We expect to have the paperwork in place in 15 business days. No funds will be moved (except for refund requests) while this is moving towards completion.
For liability reasons, Mining operations (and co-op GBs) will be shielded in a completely separate company under the same umbrella, most likely to be incorporated in Texas, for this child corporation.
**UPDATE: After further review of the legal challenges in bringing this to the United States, we've decided to launch in the EU first and South America soon after.**
The first EU locations will be in countries that have expressly stated that they have no issues with Bitcoin. **If you would like a refund, there is no restock fee due to this update in plans.**
We are doing are best to stay on the right side of the law, and we're setting up 4 child corporations in order to shield different arms of our operations from one another, legally.
BTW, 94 shares sold so far. 24 shares pre-reserved by Co-op leaders. 118 shares accounted for.
We currently have 82 shares available out of 200 in our first pro Group Buy for the ATM arm of our co-op's pro activities.

Lack of regulation and clear rules is already hindering US Bitcoin innovation.

Yes, they're using COTS components when possible. It simplifies the supply chain &amp; reduces design complexity to not have to reinvent the wheel.
I felt it was worth the $1K risk if they really do end up shipping next week or even August. If you really do have $ to risk that you can afford to lose, then taking a $700 chance on a 25GH ASIC miner to be received in August is a no-brainer. That thing will make ROI in about a week if the dang thing arrives.
As you can see: it's slim pickings out there at the moment. I was pissed at myself for missing the Bitfury August pre-order. I found out about it from BitCoin Talk but sold out in 1 night &amp; by the next day it was too late.
@_date: 2013-09-24 22:37:31
I could but I'm busy selling $30K worth of HashFast miners in the last 5 weeks or so: 
My at-cost cooperative is up to 36 members (after I update  and 4 HashFast miners in a little over a month.
I've got 48 shares available (out of 200 total on Saturday) for a non-MPP Sierra. Thanks to a deal I worked out with HashFast: **We still have HashFast Flash Sale pricing if anyone's interested.** The offer is good till Friday &amp; there's no better looking deal out there as far as pre-orders. I'm having the rigs hosted at multiple miner host sites of vetted co-op members. ~50 cent kilowatt electricity is too expensive to host in Hawaii.

The more people that contact him w/ interest in a Round 5, it's likely that he'll be quicker to organize one if there's pent up demand for more at-cost shares. 
With our at-cost shares that include UPS/Battery purchases built into the cost, we're all about trying to give people access to "rich people" pricing &amp; the best values found only at the top end, to normal folks like us.

Uh...not too good...
Think about it.
You actually want to buy printing labels with cash &amp; save BTC for hoarding or for purchases that you can't get any other way except thru BTC. In Group Buys, ASICminer reseller Canaryinthemine actually recommends sending him prepaid labels paid with cash so that people can preserve their bitcoin. 
Why would you want to waste something that's steadily increasing in value (BTC) instead of using something that's constantly losing value (US currency due to inflation) ?
A lot of people have bought stuff in the last year where it essentially cost them 400% type returns. In other words, lots of folks paid BFL &amp; Avalon X amount BTC in 2012 that's now worth 4X (and often they *still* don't have their miners) in 2013. 
Not fun to realize that $50 doodad you bought last year with BTC would've been worth $200 BTC if you had just kept it. Or that you paid the 2013 BTC equiv. of $200 for what was a $50 item in 2012.

According to anarchist/economist Jeffrey Tucker: the value of a US Dollar has declined 95% since 1913, so that $1 in 1913 has the equivalent spending power of only $5 today. That's what sucks about saving in USD; you're losing purchasing power to inflation even if you get a pittance of interest.
No joke: I tried out the mcxNOW Cyrptocurrency Exchange yesterday, the first day I ever heard of 'em &amp; made a 50% return so far because of the share price growth &amp; fees they pay as interest. I doubt their IRA or 401(k) has ever seen anything like this in a day, eheh...but then again I acknowledge I'm more then willing to take calculated risks after doing my research, then most investors would.

No, I coordinate Group Buy purchases where we all own a share based on how many shares you purchase (for example: this Round3 had 100 shares available). It's fractional risk where we share the risks and rewards in proportion to ownership. The very best values are only found at the top end, if you're looking for the best bang for your BTC. I help people get the same type of purchasing power and values that you would normally have if you had $10K or more to buy your miner(s).
It'll be hosted at a pro colo site in Missouri at bobsag3's location and I do remote admin and miner payouts with another Network Engineer.
Some of this donation was straight BTC, most of the donation was in the form of 2.5 shares worth about $310 in total, with another $80-90 worth of BTC sent directly to the R1 gentleman with lifelong major disabilities.
I don't play around when it comes to other people's money/BTC/IDs. I *def.* wouldn't mess around with funds/shares meant for a donation to someone else less fortunate.
UPDATE: I secured 2 Sierras at Flash Sale pricing by calling them directly. My at-cost Group Buy appears to be the only place you can still take advantage of Flash Sale pricing after today. Our full payment for both miners are due Friday.

You may want to think about just opening up the case &amp; blasting a box fan at it to keep your temps down. From what your telling me it's much too hot in that enclosed space.

With years of experience designing prototype IT systems I can tell you that excessive heat will definitely reduce hardware longevity &amp; could lead to PCB elements like MOSFETs or capacitors to "blow up."

Honestly - except for tiny USB ASIC miners with only 333MH -  there's no one that has anything in stock &amp; ready to ship. That's why the in-hand ASIC miners you do see on Ebay are selling at such a high premium (so high, ROI may never be met).
-I have a couple of BFL Jalapenos on order but I don't expect to see that until November-December, if at all this year. If you do order from BFL, Jalapenos seem to be shipping the fastest (they're up to pre-orders from the end of October 2012). They now appear to be pumping out a month's worth of Jalapeno orders in a week.
-For American suppliers the closest I found was a 25GH Bitfury pre-order shipping in October for $1300. 
- You can check the Bitcoin Talk Custom Hardware forum for group buys &amp; assembly of pre-purchased chips. Liquid Synergy looks interesting.
- If you really want to take a flier &amp; risk some $ on a Chinese ASIC miner supplier like I did, ASX Project is *supposed* to start shipping 200 units next Friday. I figured at the prices they were offering I couldn't afford *not* to take the risk. I just put an order in for a 50GH unit at $1K. Supposedly, batch 2 will cost much more.
I wouldn't bet your rent money on ASX Project shipping next week but if you have some funds you can risk that appears to be your only non-Ebay option to potentially get your hands on decent ASIC hardware sooner rather than later. I know Bitcoin Talk sees them as a scam but I think there's a bit of racism involved with that because nearly *all* ASIC chips come from China.
Of course: caveat emptor &amp; all that...

Thank you!
I hope that you can continue to keep this updated as US rules and regulations change.

Hi, I'm sorry to about your loss. Death sucks is all I can say. :(
Now first off: don't do anything rash in your grief.
From what you said it seems like your friend was running USB block erupters. They don't generate much &amp; they don't cost much $ to run (2.5W each, which isn't much individually). 
- If you can afford to run them on the side they will continue to generate a modest amount of Bitcoin. Their ability to generate BTC will decline as new hashing power comes online. If you're concerned about electricity costs, perhaps look at Solar Panel PPAs ($0 down) from Solar City, Sun Run, or some reputable local company.
Bitcoin has never had a down year if you Buy and Hold BTC. At this moment in time, it's a safe bet that this annual upward trend in value and usage rate will continue to go up (but not guaranteed). There are stories on this forum of users finding lost or forgotten BTC &amp; scoring financial windfalls from their "modest" amounts.
- You *could* sell them via ebay or Craigslist. 
If you do decide on this route, I'd act fast if I were you however as the value of these USB keys are depreciating quickly with new ASIC manufacturers shipping powerful rigs. If you decide on Craigslist, sell it right at a police station so you don't get robbed or mugged. My 2 Satoshis.

Nah, as a moderate Dem., I wanna pay taxes when I do cash out mined coins down the line.
I want to pay long term capital gains taxes at 15%. Those roads, bridges, and civil services don't come from nowhere.
If *everyone* ends up dodging taxes, we end up a true failed anarchy state. I don't want to live in a place like Somalia, so I'll happily pay taxes.
We're already starting to see this in the US, with corporations hiding their wealth overseas to not pay their fair share at home (all while whining about taxes being too high). Corporations are being taxed at the lowest rate they've ever been taxed at, yet they still lobby for more breaks. 
This just pisses me off because they get the benefits of operations in a safe country, but do little (or not enough) to help with the upkeep of their own country to protect shareholder profits.

Wow GrassyGreenIntegra, that's *really* generous of you. 
I'd definitely be interested in one of those K16s if it's not marked up too much. I can pay in BTC or Paypal when they show up if you're serious. I'm one of those poor bastards waiting on BFL &amp; am now expecting it to be a doorstopper by the time those orders arrive.

Anyway, hooray for Technobit and marto74! 
I know people were looking askance at Technobit on this forum, but he does appear to be producing real product based on Avalon chips.

Hi Paypal! Butthurt much?

I say this only helps BTC, even if the twins are a bit...off?
If you're a Bitcoin fan: This is a *good* thing that helps to legitimize Bitcoin in the public's eye. And what's good for the goose...

Peeps would send him BTC just because that shit would be funny, yo.

Have also noticed that the amount you have there doesn't seem to affect your interest rate, having multiple accounts there.

I, as the CEO of a new company which evolved on the Bitcoin Talk Group Buys forum, was pooling funds meant to buy US BTC ATMs. I need to publicly delay this launch until murkiness surrounding our Bitcoin laws (or lack therof) are further defined and clarified by Washington DC. People who backed the US launch have been given the option for a refund at no restock fee. No one has taken us up on this offer yet. 
Funds will not be moved or spent until our paperwork is finalized.
Here is the updated launch of our Robocoin Operators Network:
Round 14A: Düsseldorf, Berlin, Germany (SOLD OUT in 6 hours)
Round 14B: Amsterdam, Netherlands (OPEN)
Round 14C: Mexico City, Mexico
Round 14D: Brasília, Brazil [Home of Summer Olympics 2014]
Round 14E: Caracas, Venezuela
Round 14F: Shanghai, China
Round 14G: Tokyo, Japan
Round 15H: London, UK
Round 14I: Sydney, Australia
Round 14J: Stockholm, Sweden
Round 14K: Johannesburg, SA?
- DZ, CEO

I have no affiliation with Technobit, just bringing this to the community's attention.

Ah! So you listened to my advice &amp; the others telling you to sell it. 
Good on ya mate!
I bought a used Jally for $500 &amp; sold it for $1850 on ebay. Then sold 2 one month Jally pre-orders for $100 over my cost. Took the balance &amp; funded a Group Buy for a HashFast:
**With 5GH on hand &amp; 10GH on order, I took that 15GH/s worth of unflashed Jalapenos &amp; I was able to take advantage of arbitrage to convert that to 100-400GH/s in late October!** HashFast has a Miner Protection Plan that'll ship you 2-4X your Hash Rate if you don't make ROI in 90 days.
I then turned around &amp; started a Group Buy Escrow Coordinator &amp; Miner Host Matchmaking service for the BTC Talk forum:
Of which I already have a few clients on the Buyer &amp; Seller side. So: thanks arbitrage &amp; thanks BFL for having some hardware that I was able to make a profit from. :)

FYI: that's an outlier value. I've been there a while. Transacted maybe 200+ BTC there and I own some mcxfee shares.
It varies. It can be as low as 3%. I've seen it as high as 38% today. 
The most that I personally saw was when I first joined. Dem were the days: **the percentages were thousands of percent.** I kid you not.

Let's get hyperbole and discussions of "intrinsic this" and "intrinsic that" out of the way and just discuss facts.
Gold 1 year returns: 
Bitcoin 1 year returns: 
Let's even forget their names for a second. Hindsight is 20/20 and all that and past results don't guarantee future results but if you were a clever hairless monkey that had to choose between X and Y only knowing this data, which would you choose?
- X has a 1 year annual return of -8%. 
- Y has a 1 year annual return of 6,600%
X has had its day in the sun but is still an inflation hedge. It's done 50% over the last 5 years, which is actually good, historically. However, Y is the new kid on the block; yet he's so young he might as well be a toddler...oh wait, he is. Y has had *triple* digit growth every year since 2009 and it will likely be many years before it sees a slow down in growth.
Sounds like someone's been backing the wrong letter. :D

The "messiness" of the launch is entirely my fault.
I was of the opinion that a prime US East Coast location would be missed out on, if I delayed any longer on this deal I've been working on since the launch of Robocoin. Turns out that shouldn't be a worry, as the legal barriers to entry and legal murkiness for a BTC ATM in the US is higher than in other countries, unfortunately.
The timeline is a February 2014 Delivery for our November first batch orders (which ends on the 18th). Units are fabricated in Phoenix, Arizona.
- The waiving of a restock fee was for those unhappy that R14A was *NOT* going to be a US launch.
- We'd also waive this restock fee for anyone that has come to the realization that the R14B ATM they're receiving net profits from is heading to Amsterdam, if anyone had any issues with the liberal culture of Amsterdam.
Other than that: for our ASIC miner preorders and BTC ATM preorders, standard restock fees of 1.5% will apply for refunds on hardware all the way up until hardware ships (after which no refunds are available after shipping).

Technically, I guess I could if I had free electricity and if I didn't care about only making microBTC.
It'd be free in this instance, right?

Aw yeah. Good on ya, mate!
I, for one, created a part time job out of thin air that will likely lead to full time work thanks to Bitcoin and Bitcoin miners.
@_date: 2013-09-27 20:12:34
Ha! You got me!
Just kidding.
I promise that I'm not technobit although I've talked to him before. If anything, I'm a competitor as I run a HashFast Miner's Cooperative that sells at-cost shares. 
We have 3.2TH/s+ on order and expect to order another 800GH/s soon as upgrades for our Round 1 and Round 2 Baby Jets. :)
I can send you the same PM from both DZ accounts. ;D
We may order other miners besides HashFast in the future but we sure like that MPP.
