i think its mostly a january dip, people spend a lot in december and pay it off in january so less to spend on crypto. S Korea made the dip worse with ban rumors and then new taxes on trading but it will recover. by the end of march we will see 20k agin

it dipped because of korean ban rumors then new korean taxes. its just recovering... and maybe a little tether manipulation

would mining using solar panels for power be a good option, free power but high startup cost

can't buy stocks on credit why should crypto be different

@_date: 2018-02-04 23:02:05

its defiantly not apocalypse resistant, if the internet goes down how do you send btc, if theres no power how do you send it, its not EMP resistant
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:38:57

if this was legit why would they need investments? they say 250&amp; gains in 5 days that would be around 1500&amp; a month? with these numbers you could make $70,368,744,177,664,000 in just a year. either my math is way off or its a scam lol
