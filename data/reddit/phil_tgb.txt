Mr. Coin,
We received some email inquiring about this thread, which we're happy to address.
* You're right to be skeptical - in fact, it's the only way to view such a young industry. The bitcoin market has been subject to a number of fraudulent actions in the past and there will surely be more in the future.
* We write these articles after immense inbound request from our readers. Staying up to date on developments that occurs largely over dispersed forum posts is difficult to make sense of for most people, we're simply trying to bring pieces together for their benefit and give them a base from which to begin their own research. You'll notice the discussion in the bitcointalk thread that we link to in the first sentence of the article is ongoing - I hope you'll bring up the same questions there.
* With regards to the signals you list above: they are logical, but one of the problems with such a young space is that the level of professionalism from a business/marketing standpoint is still largely undeveloped by otherwise intelligent and credible people. *That is not, by any stretch, to say that AMC is credible, just that discounting on that alone is not enough for us to deprive our readers of the information they seek.
* AMC has been extremely responsive and vocal to customer concerns on the bitcointalk.org forums, and partnerned with an established ASIC manufacturer.
* With regards to one of your comments later in this thread: we have never and will never write paid content. Ever. EVER. 
* Like with any investment - mining or otherwise - everyone should independently assess potential risks and make an educated decision
We built TGB to elevate discussion to help bitcoin grow and mature because we believe in the good it can do for the world. With thoughtful comments like the one you added above, I would argue that you are doing the same.
Unfortunately, we cannot monitor reddit regularly to respond, but if you have any other question, you can reach us at contact(at symbol)thegenesisblock(dot com).
