I'm not denying that what is occurring at this point in time is not a DOS attack.  I'm saying that someone who wished to execute a massive money drop across Africa today would cause the same amount of trouble to the network.  Am I wrong?

You aren't answering the question.  The amount sent is arbitrary in my example.

Thank you sir

Is anyone else having trouble viewing on Livestream?  Says event started but I don't see a stream anywhere when I click on OPs link.

I'm not getting emotional, but who's to say that the person "DOS attacking" the system isn't trying to send millions of kids in a Africa a small amount of Bitcoin.  While it's unlikely, it seems very counterintuitive to Bitcoin to discriminate transactions.

Why hasn't Nasdaq adopted that after so many years?

An append only spreadsheet which is monitored by a centralized authority? You sure?
@_date: 2015-07-03 12:55:52
My point though is why Nasdaq hasn't adopted such technology even before Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-03 13:12:44
Could you please elaborate on how it is insecure vs. Bitcoin blockchain?
@_date: 2015-07-03 05:08:24
I know but why are they even still using paper certificates and do people even care that Nasdaq is centralized?  Wouldn't my example be a way to upgrade without bitcoin?

Are you currently in Greece?  How do you think the vote is going to sway?
@_date: 2015-07-03 13:19:04
So you think that it's the cost aspect which has hampered someone like Nasdaq from creating a centralized version of an append-only spreadsheet with user access via their user account?  
@_date: 2015-07-03 12:54:43
My point is why hasn't Nasdaq AT LEAST created such a platform which already seems to be a large upgrade although not as powerful as Bitcoin.
