Over 50 cases of losses submitted on the lawsuit website.

What sort of nonsensical double speak is this? On what hand you say BCH and BTC are both bitcoin, when on Aug 1st VIAbtc forked from the Bitcoin network and renamed to bitcoin cash, now you disagree all forks shouldn't be called Bitcoin. Bitcoin is Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash is bitcoin cash. Roger's antics using Bitcoin dot com to mislead noobs will be resisted. If he wasn't wrong or scared that the lawsuit had some merit why did he change it? If a powerful malicious team comes they will be heavily resisted the same way a harfork was resisted via UASF and no such thing as "bitcoin core control". Bitcoin is bitcoin. And I don't subscribe to nonsense conspiracy theories

I guess other forks of Bitcoin are Bitcoin as well? FOH

This made plenty sense

5-10 sats for segwit Txns, how low do you want?  Besides my point is if bcash offers lower.. Use it. No2x

Besides That doesn't answer the question,  is bigger blocks translate to lower fees, then use bitcoin cash.. No need to force 2x on Bitcoin

What were they supposed to do?  Fold their arms and look.. While and his cronies try to sabotage the network? It was was a necessary stop to block an unwanted protocol change

Bitcoin fees are on our with BCH fees,  Bitcoin has 27x more transactions. Fees are really low on bitcoin Now With segwit. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:22:59
Yes,  so?  Besides Bitcoin works fine
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:10:35
Not sure about your first point. But agreed with last point. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 13:48:43
This is very accurate. I sincerely wanted to get their view,  hoping for a solid argument in favour of 2x.. Like nothing.. Spiteful creatures they are
@_date: 2017-07-02 23:12:48
This is indeed a very nice point.

Same way they subtly advocate centralisation, saying bitcoin is already centralized
