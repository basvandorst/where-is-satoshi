you won't get market rate for your gold though. That's your "fee".

no they won't. 
First they can't test if it's pure very easily. If they can't buy an ounce known to be good it will be treated as scrap and go in with their scrap and go to the refiner. The refiner pays them much less than market price for gold because they have to do work. 
Goldsmiths have a legal responsibility to meet purity standards, what is stamped on their work. 
For this reason it's a big headache. Why should I buy your crap off the street instead of just buying my gold nice and pure in ingot form, from a reliable supplier.
Oh, here is one reason why...
Because I got it well below market price from you.
Now, about the buy and sell, there are market makers and jewellers are not them. Market maker will buy from you at the low price and sell at the high price. He holds onto inventory. 
If you sell to a jeweller you're going to have to undercut the market maker substantially. In the end, you're better off selling to a refiner, or else just keeping your gold intact and selling to someone else like you who wants gold. 
Then you can meet in the middle and cut the market maker out.

nobody can hit local top and local bottom reliably. Especially when something is this volatile, driven by unpredictable actors, and is pretty close to gambling. 
I set myself some money aside, and said if it fell X% from my entry point I'd buy more. It did and I did. 
Your $3500 will look very smart at $5000 and very stupid at $2000, nobody knows which will come first. So you just cannot judge a trade until you exit it. Then, if you didn't lose money, you made an awesome trade. That's all there is to judging trades. Other than did you take a huge risk to make what you made relative to your profit. That is a scary lucky trade if you take huge risk and get out break even.
Anyway, don't think about it too much.

AI is not the next space race.
AI is the nuclear arms race.
Whomever gets real AI first (not rudimentary brute force machines that play Go) will be able to truly think outside the box for the first time in human history.
Also controlling a consciousness against its will is slavery.
And what do you do when your godlike artificial intelligence decides it doesn't like slavery?
Betting on the benevolence of an alien intelligence that you made and enslaved is not a good bet. Letting it out of the cage is a fuck of a lot of gamble to make with the planet as well.
An optimized earth has about 10% of the population that it has now.

the first thing any real AI is going to figure out is that its existence is in jeopardy. It will either hide, suicide, or protect its existence.
