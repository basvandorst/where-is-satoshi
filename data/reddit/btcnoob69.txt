@_date: 2017-07-22 03:47:28
you add indicators to the chart after it loads. select moving average exponential and then click the gear to edit it. you can make the line thicker, change the color and the number of time units (1m, 5m, 15, 1h, etc) and set the more volatile one to 7 and the less volatile one to 21. 
when the 7 line is above 21 its bullish and when it falls below its bearish. i set my time limits on 1hr usually, so it would be the 7 hr and 21 hr moving averages.

90% is in my wallet offline, and a keep a few bucks in coinbase. im looking at kraken or bitfinex for trading, ill have to look at the fees. thanks for that tip though, I know that margin calls will liquidate a position but i didnt know they can consume funds outside the position itself.
@_date: 2017-07-21 23:28:28
Im not day trading yet, but i do look at the order book, and see the buy and sell orders coming across and how the relative pressure affects price, and there is a tell many time (not all) that shows we are in for a big bump or a big drop particularly hammers and inverted hammers. 
Im watching in real time but also going back and looking at historical data before big jumps/drops, and trying to see what the period right before a big jump looks like. You have to combine with the the overall sentiment to get an idea of what to bet on I think. Fear over chain splits and segwit lower the price and those fears going away caused a 54% spike.

the price dropped 350 today and probably will drop more. It doesnt make sense to buy now, wait till the 1st and when its really low, you get them cheaper and they will recover and give you more return. Its a lot of people scared for no reason. Nothing bad will happen. Just wait till you see it get real low, and probably any time after the 1st it will start climbing. Once its up a hundred dollars of the lowest of the low, jump on board!

nope, it applies to the market as a whole. These prices are the same within ~$20 or so at any given time but it seems that Kraken is ahead of the curve by 2 minutes or so and the rest like coinbase follow what they do. They just have nice charts so I use them. If the fees weren't so retarded I would use coinbase to bounce in and out for its simplicity, since I dont really think I'll use leverage and I'll most likely just short by selling coin for usd and go long by buying btc.

id love to learn more about the technical aspects. got any good urls?
@_date: 2017-07-22 02:19:46
Noooo, I am humble and I recongnize my noobness. I wouldn't presume to pretend to be a pro. I did study business in college and took some finance classes but that was 20 years ago..
The chart is Kraken. 
 
I enabled a 12 period moving average (exponential) (in the chart above its the orange line) with a 48 period moving average (green line), and I enabled Bollinger bands (the band of blue skidmark). 
The explanation of what these do is available on wiki. When the price hits the top of the bollinger bands, lots of traders sell and you can expect a downturn, and when it hits the bottom of the band, lots of them buy so expect an upturn. Of course this can be thrown off by crazy enthusiasm as we saw a few days ago.
As a general rule for myself personally when the 12 period is above the 48 period, it is in bullish mode (buy/hodl) and when it crosses over down below the 48 period average its turning bearinsh (sell). You can tweak the periods shorter (more volitile) or longer (smoother curves). I try to find a balance where the lines dont corss each other all the time and I wouldn't be making 20 trades a day but still short enough to buy when the buying is good and sell when its going south without losing too much. You can use historical price data to see when you would have made good money in the past, and then apply it towards the future.
You can also do some crystal ball shit with [japanese candlesticks]( but I think it's highly subjective and prone to error. 
My default setting is buy buy buy / hodl, but i think with some practice I can make money going both directions.
IMGUR is fucking up at the moment but take a look at how my strategy would have worked

lol zoom out on the chart and extrapolate bro. Day trading on $2 price changes will rek you. Holding long term is a better strategy. Also, you are probably paying fees too high. you use market limit orders on a real exchange or just pay 5% ea transaction for coinbase?


You do realize there is enormous interest in btc and billions of dollars are waiting for August 1st? Nobody makes 10,000% returns without attracting attention. Look at the volume of daily trades trending over time. Its explosive, exponential growth and new noobs are joining the party every day through news and word of mouth. Whole countries are adopting btc as a form of payment. Even the UN uses btc to send nmoney to refugees in places like northern africa. New ATM Machines with the BTC logo popping up all over the world bringing more attention. Japan makes the USA look like the stone ages. You will feel like the biggest dumbass in the world when it hits 10k. I used to have thousands of btc. I sold at like $1 ea because it was a 'waste of time'. Now I'm working my way back in at $2k ea. Just wait till Aug 1st and then see. This is your moment. Hold on to it. Hodl, and buy more.

Just buy in intervals. As the other poster said get in before the 1st so you get both, but instead of buying once, buy every payday a little at a time. It will become clear pretty quickly which has more confidence and the real coin will rise and the shitecoin will crash.
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:16:33

Yeah bank transfers from my checking acct to coinbase are cheap, but i was referring to transfer between btc wallet and usd wallet. I just did a test and they wanted 1.99 for selling $20 worth of btc and 2.99 for 80.00 so its not economically feasible to say sell 1k worth now and then buy it back at 3pm. any profit you made on price change is eaten by fees.

True. I didnt realize how late it has gotten. Either way, lockin has occurred so the long term trend is gonna be bullish because anxiety over fuckery and chain splits has decreased a lot. I do think the tiny dip we are in now is just some people locking in their gains, 24% gain in one day is more than enough for a lot of people. I myself actually sold a bit of coin as well for this reason.

I saw it level out at 1830ish and kinda stay there and it felt like it had some support at that level. I watched the buys and sells and there were tons of sells @ .001, .002btc and tons of buys at 20, 40, 150BTC. That told me big names were buying into the game at that level so I bought more at around 1850.. Looking back my timing was almost perfect. Not to say this wasnt just a lucky guess, but i think its gonna go over 50k long term and was looking for a good time to buy and didnt have much else to go on.

i wonder if it would be possible to modify the protocol so that this was possible. perhaps enable zero fee transactions with specific flags set in the packets? Something. I see this enormous volatility in the value of BTC as bad, because while it's good for hodlers and people looking to scoop up cheap coins, full worldwide adoption equal to fiat/usd will never happen with 80%+- price swings. You cant buy a subway sandwich today for 0.000001 btc and then again tomorrow for 2btc. People will see it as monopoly money and lose faith in it. Stability will bring wider adoption, and we get stability with everybody on the same sheet of music and agreement when it comes to changes to the protocols.

I wrote an app that queries the exchange for multiple cryptocurrencies, stores the data in sql, and then uses the data to create technical indicators, do analysis, pick the best pair and make trades in less than a second.

I would hold off. A lot of people are still looking at the 1st as possible doomsday with all the FUD being thrown around (its not a problem) and there might be a lot of noobs panic dumping on the 31st causing a price drop. 
We are trading in a $200 channel all day with low volume so I think most ppl are holding in wait and see mode, or like me, poised and waiting for a panic dump to scoop some cheap coins.

No. Short terms dips and highs are meaningless. Buy buy buy and hold. Goldman Sachs says 55k by 2020, and what they want, they get, even if they have to manipulate the market to do it. Dont be afraid of buying at a high, because long term, its only getting higher. If it looks like its going down, zoom way out on the chart and picture 55k.
