Buy hashrate by the gigahash. Pricing is lower per giga hash that lower cost actual hardware, such as Asic Miner Blade and USB Miners. You sell your ghs in a commoity like market.
The operation is located in the UK Cex.IO
**Disclaimer... All mining whether with actual are cloud mining is a high risk venture. But this may be the future of mining.

You have huge balls my friend. I tend to agree with you and I would invest a large percentage of my funds, but I dont have that much. Come back and post in six months. Have you considered a small amount in actual mining. Cloud mining is getting popular I just bought some Ghs from  some are making money day trading.

A better option may be to create a linux VM. It a lot easier to do and less prone to problems. Vbox it is a free program that you can use to make the VM. Option 2 is to create a bootable linux USB stick. Very easy to do and when the USB is in your sock drawer it aint gonna get hacked. 
I would go with the second option.
