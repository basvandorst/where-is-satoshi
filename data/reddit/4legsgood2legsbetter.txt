All may not be lost. Your PRIVATE KEY may still be on the drive. What you need to do is STOP USING THE HARD DRIVE the more you use it the greater chance your PRIVATE KEY is going to be overwritten. Now if you didn't encrypt your wallet (put a password) you can run a [program]( from a linux live distro to recover the private key and get your bitcoins back. Now if you encrypted (password protected) your wallet you simply cannot just recover your private key you must recover the entire wallet.dat file (the file that stores your private keys). The program I linked to cannot do this currently so I sugest doing some googling to find other solutions or if there is enough coins on the hard drive getting a proffesional to do it for you.

We need to stop thinking in terms of PC's too. I hope in the future no one is keeping there coins on there PC, there are just to many services to keep a computer secure. We need to create a solution that will also work on the next generation of hardware wallets.

Why would the side upgrading Bitcoin want to make it more difficult to do so? That's exactly how hardfork upgrades work. It will only be a problem for small blockers if they chose to continue using the minority chain.

There is no way to prove what hash power is owned by who.  If that was the case mining wouldn't even be necessary are we could just distribute coins evenly to each individual.  Be sure to read the whitepaper if you already haven't.  It is actually a really easy read once you understand the basics like hash function ect.
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:28:15
@_date: 2017-11-01 05:31:52
Depending on the amount of hash power leaving block times can turn into days... Sure you don't have to hardfork just enjoy waiting months for a retargeting. POW change will also result in a hardfork which as I'm sure you know many of the core devs are against. Not to mention many of they are against a POW change itself.

I've been involved in Bitcoin since 2010 just because one player contols most of the mining doest mean the rules change.  If you don't like it go develop your own Asics start mining co-ops. Just don't keep spreading mis information.

No, solving block hashes is proof of work. If it was number of nodes anyone could spin up 10,000 nodes and change the rules to whatever they want. Please read the whitepaper.

One of the first reply's given when anyone asks about scaling is to shut the fuck up and wait for lighting networks.  They have been coming soon tm for 3 years. No one can ask the devs to put more of there time towards it but i think it perfectly reasonable to ask them to say "hey this won't be done for another 2 year start look at other scaling solutions" rather then let Bitcoins growth stagnate through willful ignorance.

@_date: 2017-11-04 04:54:52
I've been watching development since late 2010 early 2011 and the problem has just been getting worse and worse.  What most people don't seem to understand is fees are not in USD so they will get more expensive as price increases. That $5 transaction fee at $5000 will be $50 at $50000 but more likely $200 at $50000 as the number of transaction will increase. Lightning Network as been coming soon TM for years now and if there isn't even a timeline for it to be developed its time to start exploring other options.
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:53:34
As I understand schnorr only helps reduce multisig transaction. Although I recommend you double check this as I'm not 100% certain.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:20:54
I hate to ask for ETA's for open source projects that are developed 100% with donations.  However, since the core devs have rejected all on chain scaling in favor of lightning network I don't think it is unreasonable to demand a clear timeline for when this will happen.  So my question is "Can you please clearly outline a timeline for the development of Lightning Network that is stable enough to be used in consumer applications?"
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:29:06
Many of us see it more of a choice between a system that doesn't exist, doesn't have a timeline for existing, and could be argued is more centralized than its alternative. Versus a safe small block size increase that will temporally reduce congestion the second it goes into effect.

To be a softfork segwit had to keep the 1mb block size limit. So legacy nodes don't receive any witness data and cannot validate Segwit transactions.  Instead witness data is put at the end of a transaction and striped when sent to legacy nodes to keep the 1mb limit. The concept of block size is replaced with block weight.  The following formula is used to calculate the block wight: 


Block weight is capped at 4 mb right now.  Segwit is a increase in transaction per block no one will argue that but it is more complicated than just that. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:19:41

No you are being a pedantic little fuck. I said 1 meg blocks. I didn't specify block size vs block weight. Didn't specify anything about witness data being included or not. You knew exactly what I mean but chose to nit pick because have no real point to make.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:17:59
They relay blocks and transaction that are valid to them and that's about it. If there are enough nodes to do this then there purpous is served adding a million more doesn't change anything past this point. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:49:22
Well its refreshing to see someone admit that.  You better hope those four authoritarians you like so much never start doing anything you don't agree with.  Because just like is big blockers there will people who will tell you to "deal with it".

As stated elsewhere in this thread the most likely reason for Segwits low adoption is Cores own incomplete implementation of it in there reference client. This should have been complete years ago.  Also I don't really see how hard forks could take time away from developing Bitcoin unless you include Peter Todds time which seems to mostly be "peer reviewing" everyone elses work or making twitter posts.
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:58:35
Oh no, 200 nodes not accepting there blocks when there is 800+ relaying the blocks and transactions just fine... Lol And let's say all user run nodes switched over. Well firing up enough nodes to make the network is as easy a setting up a Amazon Web server.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:26:02
Aren't you supposed to be impartial?
@_date: 2017-11-01 05:54:52


It's actually more binary than that.  The chains completely split apart.  After 1x nodes block 2x nodes because they are receiving "invalid" block from them the network will completely be two individual networks. At this point it doesn't matter how many nodes either side has as long as they have enough to propogate their blocks and transactions.


Interesting, I remember it being more severe than that. I will try to find the calculations I was looking at but you may be right.


The main issue I keep seeing with this is the possibility of a 51% attack makes supporting a minority chain irrational and thus makes the chain worthless. This combined with a slow down until the difficulty retargeting means the chain will be even less profitable to mine. Add that with the fact that Bitman has a mining monopoly and will support 2X no matter what I see 1X having a very difficult time getting off the ground.
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:34:22

I'll continue using Bitcoin just as I have for the last 7 years... If you have a problem with Bitcoin being decentralized and people having the right to there own opinion you can use a altcoin. Imagine what the price would be if transactions fees where less.

That assuming a POW changed coin will have any value at all. This is deep discussion in itself but one could argue that a large amount of Bitcoins value comes from the billions of dollars invested in the infrastructure that secures. Also it would be hard to argue a POW change will have consensus and will most likely cause another split weakening the 1X chain further.


I don't understand what this is in reference too.


Fees are not inelastic people will not pay $500 fees to make up the difference.  More blocks per minutes = more profitability with all else being equal. If the majority chain has a 6 blocks a hour and a price of $1000 that's $6000 of revenue a hour. If the minority chain has 1 block a hour due to high difficulty and low hash rate at a price of $1000 that's $1000 a hours. Also the minority chain will have a transaction thru put of 1/6th of the majority chain.


That is assuming Bitmain is a rational actor which they have proven themselves not to be.  They are mining empty block losing millions in fees already.  2X should already be more profitable due to the factors above but even if all that fails Bitmain can easily sway the market with their 50% market-share.


I like most people wish Bitcoin was build on POW such a Cuckoo Cycle but its too late for that and to think the entire network will switch over is a long shot.
Difficulty adjustment:
50% 20 minute blocks, 1 month retarget
25% 40 minute blocks, 2 month retarget
12.5% 1 hour 20 minute blocks, 4 month retarget
6.25 % 2 hour 40 minute blocks, 8 month retaget
Even a 1 month re target is death sentence in crypto time.
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:12:45
Did I ever say that core nodes shouldn't be trying to block 2X nodes? Why wouldn't they try to everything in there power to win? Just like 2X shouldn't add replay protection as it would reduce it chances of success.  My original point was node count past the point having enough nodes to reliably relay blocks and transactions mean nothing. This sub has been acting as if node count is the determining factor is a hardfork will be success full because they don't have majority of miner support. And now they realise anybody can spin up any amount of nodes they they are butthurt about it.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:45:38
So if they are core nodes they are validating block and transactions. However, if they are non core nodes they are propaganda nodes that have no effect. A node is a node is a node. There only function is to relay valid block and transaction on the network. They have no say in the rules. Please read the whitepaper before you speak on such things. You are making informed yourself look uneducated.
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:36:43
I think artificially limiting Bitcoin would be a mistake especially when it can do both.  Increasing the transaction limit results in a minuscule cost increase and will need to be done anyways as Bitcoin grows to open and close payment channels.  Plus the great thing is that a bigger limit doesn't mean more data to store, only during times of peak demand will larger blocks be needed.

Unfortunately I don't think Core wants to compromise.  They where invited to the NYA and could have negotiated a deal that made everyone happy but they didn't even bother showing up.  It's sad miners chose not to go through with the hardfork and prove Bitcoin is truly decentralized.  For now it seems Bitcoin is controlled by a single group of devs.

Although I don't agree with 1 meg blocks this is great! You vote with you hash power, don't like the rule use your hash power and vote. If Bitmain has a monopoly on mining set up a mining COOP and develop your own hardware so you have a say. This sub need more posts like this and less "I'm running a full node because it's the easiest way I can pretend to make a difference".
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:17:21


Why. You keep repeating this but don't explain why you think this. What value do they have other than relaying blocks and transaction on there respective chain


I'd like to remind you that BIP148 failed to have any effect (  
Since you cannot give any evidence to your claims I will give you some regarding mine.  When a hardfork happens the two chains will split.  The chain with a minority of MINER support, block times will increase as more % of Hashing power leaves the chain.  Difficulty re-targets after a 2016 blocks, as such longer block times will make the time until a difficulty adjustment longer.  Less blocks will result the minority chain being less profitable as miners will have to wait longer and longer for there block reward.  Transactions fees on the minority chain will spike as users compete to have there transactions included in a block.  However due to the risk of losing coins in the early days of the hard fork the number of transaction will drop and transaction fees will not be enough to make up for the lack of block reward.  Due to this lack of profitability more and more miner support will leave the minority chain delaying the difficulty readjustment longer.  During this time the minority chain could have 1,000,000 more nodes than the majority POW chain but it will make no difference.  A large % of Bitcoins hashing power is also in the control of a irrational actor who has shown they will mine a certain chain for ideological reasons rather than short term profit as well this will put further pressure on the minority chain.  Finally, one may argue that miners will continue to mine the minority chain because its price will be high enough in the short term to offset the lack of profit from long block times.  However, miners do not think in the short term, they have years of there lives and billions of dollars invested into Bitcoin they will do what is best for the price in the long term.  This is in contrast to someone who put in the bare minimum effort in and set up a full node and has convinced themselves that this gives them the same amount to power as miners. lol

Fair enough, I just believe if your going to stall big blocks for years you should have a complete implementation of your alternative.  This is why bigger blocks was such a great alternative.  No code change just raising one variable that would come into 100% effect from day one on all blocks/all transactions. But I guess segwit block averaging 1.07mb is cool too.

Where did I say this? all nodes have the same effect.  No core nodes are not magic nodes that "secure the network and give me voting powers"


Did you not read my post?  Any nodes past the point of having enough to relay blocks and transaction do not provide any extra security function to the network. 


So what defines a propaganda node from a non propaganda node lol. 


making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone
able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority
decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested

@_date: 2017-11-01 05:09:31
The user who said buyer was a different user than the last reply was too.  it's wrong to say that non mining nodes set concensous rules.  They just relay the transaction and blocks that are valid to their rule set.  If 2X breaks core nodes reference rules they will simply propogate there transactions and block though there nodes, the number of core nodes make no difference. There could be 1 or 1 million. If you guys are trying to argue that users of Bitcoin can continue to support the minority proof of work chain by only transacting and purchasing it's coins I can kinda agree with you.  However, this still results in some problems. For example if the minoriry chain loses a majority of its hash rate it will need hardfork difficulty adjustment. Also the minority chain will be open to 51% attacks and if this is the case it will be worthless as a trustless system.
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:41:09

Well prepare to wait a very long time for all that.  Bigger blocks has been stalled for 3 years now.  Segwit has been activated for months now and is at around 10% utilization. Lightning network is only on testnet without any timetable given by the devs for a finished implementation.  And even after that its going to take months to years for companies to develop lightning network solutions for consumers.  Schnorr signatures are also going to require tons of peer review.  It would have been nice to have a small block size increase to make Bitcoin usable while we wait for all this great new tech but, that is off the table because one group wants to remain the authority on any changes made.
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:52:11
Just saying you think BIP148 is proof doesn't make much sense when it had little to no effect.  I even gave you a source lol.

Segwit: transactions have stalled at 13% month after activation and haven't provided any meaningful congestion reduction.
Real block size increase: Day 1 increase in transaction throughput immediately reducing congestion and fees.
Segwit: the thousands of lines of untested code that made many compromised to be soft-fork.
Real block size increase: little change to code and proven to be safe by BCH, matter of fact Bitcoin didn't originally have a block size limit.

Alright let not get pedantic, I don't agree with 1 mb limit not including witness data. I want a block size upgrade that increase capacity DAY 1 not when people get around to using segwit transactions which has stalled at a tiny 13% a month after release. Is that better for you?

Can you expand on what hardening needed to be done by core for the forks?
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:15:01
This is why node count doesn't matter. I can spin up as many node as I want at anytime. It's just stupid how this sub parades around the number of core nodes, then freaks out when people spin up fake 2X nodes. In the end miners control the network not nodes.
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:12:10
Your point? Sure buyers can buy any coin they want but if miners fork off the minority chain will have much slower block times and will be less profitable to mine.  Transaction fees will shoot up due to the slow block times making it even worse to transact on.  The block re-target time will take months to fix this without a emergency difficulty adjustment.  Not to mention the minority chain is open to 51% attack this entire time so the entire trust-less model goes out the window.  So can you explain how miners don't control the rules?
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:35:51
Why are number of nodes paraded around when they are core nodes but when they are 2X nodes its a "attack".  Its almost as if miners and number of nodes decide the rules for this very reason.
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:38:10




Just the possibility that the chain can be attacked at anytime makes is not a trust-less system and essentially useless.  If 2X users are happy putting blind trust that Bitmain will not wake up one morning and decide he wants to destroy their chain good for them but that is not a compromise a majority of users will be willing to make. 




This analysis assumes no alternative, sure people would pay 1 BTC in fees if they absolutely had but why would they? There is going to be a perfectly working 2X chain with proper block times from day 1 they could transact on instead.  Do 1Xers really want a Bitcoin where they have to pay $100,000 in tx fees? 


I don't understand how a one time small block size increase to reduce congestion until working off chain scaling is complete is turning Bitcoin into PayPal 2.0.  This debate isn't really about block size if it was the block size would have been raised years ago.  This debate is about who controls Bitcoin, the core devs or the people.  If 2X wins it sets a precedent that the people can set the rules to whatever they want if they can get consensus.  If Core wins it sets the precedent that only code approved by the select few who have commit access to the core code set the rules for everyone.

Hardforking is not the worse outcome.  The dispute will be settled by majority hash power.  Bitcoin was designed to work this way.
@_date: 2017-10-08 06:51:44
None mining nodes cannot confirm transactions. To confirm a transaction it must be included in block. Blocks are solved by miners... You really need to read the white paper. A none mining node can reject a block so far as to not propogate it on the network but the block will propogate via other nodes.
@_date: 2017-10-08 06:22:56
You are misunderstanding how bitcoin works, please refer to section 6 of the whitepaper.  Miners are not payed because there blocks are validated by full nodes; miners include there block reward as the first transaction in blocks they solve.  Even if a number of full nodes have there own rules and are not validating the blocks produced by the majority chain they blocks will still propagate through nodes that are running the same software.  Furthermore, if these nodes don't have any hash power of themselves they cannot support there own set of rules.
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:01:51


the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of
blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases. - Section 4 Whitepaper
You are correct that blocks will not be valid on each-others chain.  The problem is that the minority chain will lose hash power but the difficulty re-targets every 2016 blocks. Because there is usually 6 blocks per hours difficulty usually re-targets every two weeks ((2016/6)/24). So if the minority chain losses half its hash rate blocks will slow down to 3 per hour and difficulty will not adjust until 28 days. Half it again and it will be 56 days until readjustment. And if you read above I explained why less blocks per second will reduce profitability which will speed up the loss of hash power on the minority chain. It really is a death spiral.


So core in this situation would only really have one option and that is too hardfork the core chain to decrease difficulty and remain profitable against the competing chain.  However, they have politically backed themselves in by refusing to hard fork to 2mb blocks in the past and saying that any hardfork needs a year of testing.  These chain spits are bitcoins voting method back in 2011 this common knowledge and accepted.  It was in 2013 when ASICs took over and mining became centralized that many people started to reject this, but that fundamentals of Bitcoin remain the same no matter how much it is denied.
Here is a really good wiki on difficulty adjustments and how they are calculated: 
Also I recommend listing to this GRC Security Now podcast on bitcoin:  they go over the fundamentals in great depth. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 03:18:11
Also I agree with most people here it sucks that mining has become so centralized but kicking and screaming when mines vote on new rule changes is no way to solve this.  Awhile back there was a gentleman with ASIC design experience talking about setting up a mining COOP that fabercated its own chips and his post was largely ignored by this community. However, memes calling S2X stupid are upvoted....
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:33:33
I've been involved in bitcoin since April 2011.  Back in the early days bitcoins main revolution was always that you didn't have to trust anyone.  The way you had a vote in what was happening with bitcoin was by mining.  If you disagreed with the rules you where always free to fork and go play by your own set of rules.  There was also an attitude that Bitcoin was resilient to any attacks.  This system worked great while everyone had a share of the hash power.  Then starting in 2013 ASICS came online.  All of a sudden not everyone had a vote and a increasingly smaller number of people controlled the entire hash rate.  This led to our current situation where the core developers who don't control any hash rate find themselves disagreeing with miners on the way forward.  I empathize with core developers as it must be hard to accept you have no control on something you helped create; but I also believe that you have to accept that Bitcoin was and is controlled by the miners.  This is why today you see the campaign to call anyone that disagrees with cores plan a "attack" on bitcoin, as well as attempts to show votes via twitter polls lol. However, the truth is bitcoin cannot be attacked, it will simply follows the rules that mines set.  Looking at the disagreement from this lens we can see why off chain scaling is so attractive to core.  By moving transactions off chain they now have a say again.  Now this is not to say Segwit doesn't have its advantages.  However to complete reluctance to up the block size at all is real tell towards the goal of core.  Even if Segwit would have solved all scaling problems it would have been extremely beneficial to simply raise the block size by a small amount to allow bitcoin to complete while lightning network was developed.

Miners are in control of Bitcoin. They always have been. You vote with your hash power. Just because the average person has been priced out of mining doesn't mean they can take Bitcoin over.
@_date: 2017-10-08 07:36:30
A none mining node can propogate blocks and that's about it.  You really need to read the whitepaper. No cores implementation isn't some magic, without hash power no transaction or blocks will be confirmed. If S2X get majority of the hash power the core chains difficulty will be too high for its hash power until EDA hardfork happens. No amount of none mining nodes can prevent this from happening... Now the vote that is happening is what chain will get majority of the hash power you none mining node doesn't matter in this.  This the non corrupable "math" that is happening.

No it is not the full quote is as follows. 


making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone
able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority
decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it. 
The quote is talking about majority decision making and is clear majority decision is represented on greatest proof of work chain.
What you are talking about is in the next section 5: networking 


extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some
nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received,
but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proof-
of-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other
branch will then switch to the longer one.
You have also yet to explain how a minority chain with 100min+ block times will be able to survive and compete against a majority hash power chain with 10 min blocks.  If your claim that full nodes not miners control the network rules this needs to be answered.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:03:09
A node doesn't care who spun it up. If it's a full node it's a full node. This why bitcoin is based on proof of work not proof of I.P.

The community does deside, for example if tomorrow a minority of the community desided Litecoin was now Bitcoin it would be so.  It my view that the community it deside the longest chain is Bitcoin but I could be wrong.  Changes to Bitcoin can come from anywhere, core doesn't own Bitcoin. The questions is will the majority of MINERS mine the chain. And that's what we will find out.
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:01:40
See what? I'm just explaining the fundamentals of Bitcoin. Miners make the rules. Since you have no answers for the questions about I think you are beginning to see this. Nothing political the chain with majority of hash power will win regardless of the ideological idea behind it. 


@_date: 2017-10-07 23:53:54
Yes, a mining node will broadcast its solved block which will propagate through the network by mining and non mining nodes.  S2X will be propagated by S2X nodes just fine.

 Sorry this completely wrong.  Bitcoin Cash was built with EDA rules from day one.  




If you would like to learn more about this here is a great read: 
Core code does not have any EDA built in.  You keep saying difficulty will adjust but do not say how? With the current legecy Bitcoin chain a fork with majority hash power will grind the minority chain down to a hault. If the minority chain cannot readjust in a reasonable amount of time it will fail. You are arguing that full nodes not miners control the network rules but it is clear in this senerio they have no power.
@_date: 2017-10-07 21:34:02
On a surface level view that bitcoin should stay at 1mb Blocks and use off chain transaction to scale. Whereas, advocate larger block sizes to keep bitcoin competitive in the short term while also looking at other scaling solutions long term.  On a deeper level does not believe that the miners control bitcoins software and rules while believe miners control what happens to bitcoin with there hash power. This is why considers 2x an attack and views it simply as a vote on whether to upgrade the network.
@_date: 2017-10-08 03:15:20


No evidence.


No evidence
See how easy it is to do that without providing any logical counter argument other than saying "no evidence" and saying the other side is false.


Bitcoins has always been controled by hash power. If you don't like it go mine your own blocks with your own rules... You can't without hash power. Also miners are not a handful of stagers they are the people who make Bitcoin. Without them your transactions would go nowhere. If you don't like them invest in your own mining equipment and mine by your own rules.  The true handful of strangers trying to decide the rules of Bitcoin is core.  If you don't like what the miners say you can mine yourself, if you don't like what core does what can you do? If you create your own software core supports will accuse you of attacking the network.

It didn't used to be this crazy because hash rate meant power to vote. Then in 2013 Asics came online and hash rate was consolidated in a few hands so not everyone had a vote. Now it's a power struggle between the users and hash rate controllers.

Since S2X is a upgrade to Bitcoin transaction need to be broadcast on the Bitcoin network. Adding replay protection prevents this by allowing both forks of the network continue creating a altcoin.

If you read the Bitcoin whitepaper, you will realize that Satoshi didn't even differentiate between miners and nodes. At that time nobody had heard of ASIC's, so if anyone has been going out of their way to destroy hes invention, it is the ASIC miners. Mining was supposed to be decentralized, not because it sounds nice, but because it is a requirement for Bitcoin to stay resistant against censorship and government takeover. Without that, it is worthless as a store of value, as history has shown.
The truth is that the users and investors of the technology decides if it is useful or not, regardless of what the name of the project is. If the changes 2X is doing was actually valuable to people, there would be no need to hijack the Bitcoin name, would it?
I cant tell if your trolling at this point tbh. I've spent the last day explaining to you why miners control the network and all you've been repeating is that full none mining nodes validate blocks and transactions. You didn't even understand how difficulty re-targets work. This is a sad state to see the community in compared to 2011. You have people who have little understanding about bitcoin technology who are picking sides in a political debate without even understand the basic of what they are arguing about first. Because of this people are learning about bitcoin from a political stand point and making arguments that sound good to support a ideological view point but don't reflect how the code works.

Ok so if what you say is true and the miners that don't matter switch to the S2X chain. How will the S1X chain still continue to function with a high difficulty and a minority hash rate? Does block times of 200 minutes not seem like a problem too you? Will your non mining nodes validate none existing blocks? Or will core have EDA hardfork? I'm guessing not because there retoric up until now was that a year was needed for any hardfork to be tested.

Being on the minority chain does not make it more profitable.  More blocks per minutes = more profitablity.  If the majority chain has a 6 blocks a hour and a price of $1000 that's $6000 of revenue a hour. If the minority chain has 1 block a hour due to high difficulty and low hash rate at a price of $1000 that's $1000 a hours.  Also the minority chain will have a transaction thruput of 1/6th of the majority chain.  The minority chain is also now open to 51% attacks.  You say a difficulty adjustment will happen but difficulty adjustments happen after a number of blocks are mined this could be 5mins or a year depending on hash rate and difficulty.  Only way to correct this if you are the minority chain is difficulty adjustment hardfork.  You can go ahead and spin up 1,000,000 full nodes running any software you like but it won't change these fundamentals.  Only hash power will.

I've been involved with Bitcoin since April 2011, I remember the days when everyone had a piece of the hash power and could have a vote in the future of Bitcoin.  Even though those days are gone the principles of bitcoin are still the same.  Hard-forks are referendums and miners vote with hash power.  All these twitter polls would have been laugh out of the room by the community in the early days.  The lack of compromise by the devs who took over core is also disheartening.  Segwit is a good start but its crazy how hard they have been blocking bigger blocks.  I've been hearing about lightning networks for years and it yet to make a considerable impact.  A simple compromise years ago to raise the block size while off chain scaling is developed would have prevented all this arguing and drama.

If S1X was too add replay protection its transactions would be invalid on the S2X chain and S2X transactions would be invalid on the S1X chain.  With two chains one is essentially a altcoin after the chain with the majority hash power adopts the Bitcoin name.  Without replay protection one chain will win out over the other as both cannot exist for a extended period of time.  This is why S2X is a upgrade proposal not a altcoin like Bitcoin Cash was.  There is nothing anti Bitcoin about this, it's actually a wonderful demonstration of bitcoins decentralized consensus. You vote with you hash power!

Like I've been saying Bitcoin always has and always will be controlled by the miners.  If you don't like what the miners want you need to get hash power of your own.  Also the spread of misinformation needs to stop; if people spent a quarter of the time they put into convincing newbies that miners don't matter into developing mining co-ops we would be better off.  Current miners have invested millions in infrastructure and are reaping the rewards. I agree it sucks that mining has become so centralized but let's look at the real issues and try to come to a solution not repeat this anti miner retoric that is making to community look completely misinformed.
