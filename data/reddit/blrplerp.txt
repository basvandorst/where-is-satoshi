yes you are being payed for storing coins in finex, why store at an exchange if its not for either trading or lending ?
holding bitcoin itself is a risk from economical point of view, having it in any exchange is a second risk, the trader loosing your bitcoin not so much because there is an insurance for which you pay a 15% of your interest.
This is comparable to investing in an unstable country, say Argentina that is so popular because of that, the company you are investing in, has a certain risk, and the environment has an added risk.
if i had an offer to get the same interest from an investment in argentina or USA for the same expected profit, USA all the way because of its better environment.

Personally i dont lend liquidity for less than 50% a year, be it USD or BTC, if the price is too low to lend, then i rather wait for a clear opportunity to either get bitcoin or get out of bitcoin, and i will profit much more.
even holding the USD without doing anything is a great way to get more BTC

A 1-2 month bullrun with 1000% means that new people come, and buy at those prices to get dumped on... longer bullruns with less rise is healthier.
When i spoke about bitcoin with people during november 13, no one was interested because it was a bubble and they would end up loosing money and if they use it to buy it would be more expensive than credit card, offering no benefits, when i talk to people now, no one is really interested with bitcoin because its a permaloose money.
those who made money on the rise to 1000, made money by dumping on the new adoption.

in bitfinex 11.2k right now but before the run to 315, it was 24k
The increase of the natural 8k to 24k was enough to drive the price down to 166.
Important to consider that we are in downtrend and the availability of the cheap shorts helps deepen the trend and make it harder for reversal to happen.
not so much so for usd, because when we are in bull mode, USD loans become scarce and you can lend at 0.5% per day, in this case the high price of the USD loans help for a reversal, thats why when we have a bull run is usually much shorter than the bear runs.

i was 1 year lending USD without verifying myself, deposit bitcoin, sell the bitcoins, and you have USD which you can use for lending.
Besides in value there is way more USD than BTC

this is part of the risk a liquidity provider takes within the bitcoin environment, now according to bitfinex and okcoin there are enough funds to cover anything using their insurance (finex obligatory and okcoin is voluntary)

exactly, big buyers and big sellers do it off exchange at around market price, according to their agreement, which makes the exchange market thinner and more susceptible to the available btc for shorting.
anyhow i dont know how is this relevant to the premise that the loaned BTC is being loaned too cheap at the moment the post is simply to advice people into paying more attention into what they get from the risk they take.
BTW, if you sell almost at random for a few days during downtrend, youll easily make 10%+
making money (bitcoins) in a downtrend is as easy as making money (fiat) in an uptrend. i personally have 55 time more btc than i used to have when i started.

Well, first of all, in a bank your money is pretty safe and you carry no risk whatsoever except for inflation, and thus its not so easy to get a very high interest rate.
interest rates goes high as risks increase, for example loan sharks give loans to people who are extremely risky from the financial point of view.
a bitcoin exchange is quite similar to a sharkloan, its possible that any of these exchanges will go under from one day to the next and you will loose all your money, so having the same interest as a bank is quite naive, the risk is much much higher.
furthermore the post intention is not to make a cartel of loans, but to educate normal people (they are the ones giving the loans, not the traders) on the value of their liquidity, without us liquidity providers there wouldn't be any margin at all for traders to make their large profits

i dont think so, traders dont lend :D

Market Makers have several ways to manipulate the market, for instance they can set giant support or resistance, they can continuously sell coins to modify the result of the trading indicators, they can even go and reserve large parts of the loans... what happens in the bitcoin market is not a coincidence, last run up to 315 was a short hunting trip lead by one or more whales.

this is what should be on the bills

Im not collecting emails or anything like this to have an agreement on a price, i am merely informing people that with their bitcoin loans traders have made nearly 400% this year while the lenders a mere 8% in bitcoin and 80% losses if counting usd

Not necesarily, one trade is that bitcoin will increase in value and the other is that WU will decrease value. 
WU decrease might be caused by bitcoin, but even if bitcoin fails because a better way to handle remittance is born, then WU would still loose value. 
He could make money on both trades, or only one trade, for instance bitcoin could be a success and WU could addopt bitcoin making it viable still and of easier access.
Or bitcoin could fail, while some other new payment system comes to light and WU fails
