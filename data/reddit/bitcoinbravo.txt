the value proposition is crystal clear in my eyes from an institutional level -- right now say you are a hedge fund and want to move even $50 million into BTC -- that process is very burdensome -- they can't just set-up a coinbase account or wire their funds to Slovenia -- what we have seen to date is the way it was pre-internet; things like Second Market that cater to institutions but this is really only a stop-measure in the digital age because it doesn't provide BTC as a tradeable instrument only as a position or not a position. Todays hedge funds want all the tools at their disposal and Second Market and other Bitcoin trusts just aren't enough.

well the /ES futures are the heartbeat of global finance -- so it can very much so drive trading -- +did a pretty job of articulating it above that there is always the option to take delivery -- especially if prices would start to get very out of whack from their underlying security -- that alone can be enough to keep prices inline -- if you trade bitcoin currently you probably have something like this set-up  -- a 4 panel screen of the top exchanges -- you are always watching everyone else who is watching you -- to be honest I only have an account on one of the exchanges but I know that some people somewhere will engage in arb or there is at least the incentive to arb -- with that said buys on a different exchange cause buys on the exchange I trade on -- if this wasn't the case then I would only look at one chart and remain oblivious to what is going across other exchanges -- if you think about it this is really the purest sense of price discovery -- bets long or short whether they are on exchange or on futures are telling traders market information and will impact prices -- many people track the buying of the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) who does the majority of their buying off exchange -- it just adds another piece of price discovery information -- make sense ?

I might agree with you if the institutions in those damaging events were allowed to fail (namely if we are talking about financial institutions) but too often bad actors are bailed out deemed too big to fail and zombified -- this only makes for fragilizing the system further (rewarding bad behavior)-- there-by setting up for systemic risk or black swan type events

that fails to take into account the complexities of dealing with an extremely heterogenous gene pool (as we have in the US) when trying to execute from a central point -- I work in Epi-genetics and I can tell you this element of complexity is why trying to compare a socialized medicine model of Sweden where 99.9 percent of their population is near perfectly homogeneous to that of such girth and diversity as in the US is not so simple of a comparison -- you need to do a little deeper diving into the subject matter rather than regurgitating ad hoc talking points by armchair economists

A couple of points -- Paul Graham, founder of y-combinator has made some very bold statements to the effect of don't create a product in which you think a lot of people will like -- instead create a product that a niche group is borderline fanatical about and allow them to be your marketing/sales department -- I believe by and large this is what is going on in the Bitcoin community at present with BitPay and Coinbase with the branding of businesses "accepting Bitcoin" even though ideologically these business(other than Overstock) have no skin in the game concerning Bitcoin only that they get a minimal reduction in fees and more importantly a PR and sales bump with Bitcoin evangelicals. 
You also state the feedback loop with absolute certainty that further "adoption" will drive BTC prices higher -- I think you should take a very sober look if think this is a foregone conclusion because although it DOES have the POTENTIAL to lead there it is far from certain.
Lastly the only true investment is in oneself -- education, health, relationships -- everything else is really a trade because at sometime you are going to spend said value for something that you want -- what you are really doing is speculating which I know VERY well as BTC trader myself (mostly OKC 10x futures) but I have no problem shorting Bitcoin when appropriate and when the price action in front of me remains in a downtrend 
Edit: I will say that I too spend Bitcoin at said services and do not oppose their business models(as you seem to suggest that I do) but I certainly do NOT take the same rational that by spending bitcoins at merchants I am "protecting my investment" because again as much I hope to see Bitcoin succeed in what ever terms that means I trade my Bitcoin stash based on what price action is telling me -- it has also humbled me and given me a pragmatic view of the long hard road that Bitcoin is up against

I think Marc is a smart guy generally -- he has some great insight into the relation of technology and society -- especially his discussion with Russ Roberts on EconTalk -- however I really side with you on the Snowden comments -- when I heard Marc say that Snowden was traitor I really took a step back and reconsidered my favorable view of him -- he basically was complaining that his NSA back doored investments were now suffering enormously -- so on that point I hope he loses ALL of his money on those said investments -- let the pain of financial loss(and waking up in cold sweet because of it) show him where he should be investing or at least reconsider getting in bed with the government

since you deleted your last comment I will just post here -- My background includes a descent stay on an OTC desk in the risk department of a major US bank -- I have traded and continue trade options on the $RUT for the past 7 years -- somehow you have made it here and your general attitude is one an ethnocentric and monolithic viewpoint concerning trading risk ie that counter party should not be figured in essentially -- it is also an outdated model of the boomer generation -- with that said I still not quite sure why you become so huffy concerning a risk management strategy like I have represented -- specifically when I speak to risk adjusted returns to quantify my actions -- but yes I do understand that you don't want to simply change your ways to trade BTC -- it is an entirely different animal but that doesn't default your viewpoint as "right"-- also how many times do I have to state that I am ONLY exposing 10% of my crypto portfolio ? So to re-iterate since it appears to not have set in that is 10% of my playing with that is NOT in cold storage ? so 100% loss is not possible unless public/private key crypto is broken or more likely my security with cold storage is imperfect. But from a trading perspective you are speaking entire nonsense as 100% loss is not possible if I have acknowledge idk 7 times now that I am only exposing 10% of my portfolio -- we regularly engage the chinese exchanges on hangout like Zane from OKC  -- the Trading View community is pretty involved with the exchanges that want to engage us and we will continue to do so -- I don't expect you to understand as with 20 years in the system you have been conditioned NOT to understand but props for making here -- had to have taken some work

This is standard marching orders coming down from the IMF which is over the Federal Reserve -- so I don't think it is much of surprise. The IMF watched the Lehman Brothers meltdown and political bailout and realized that it opened the global finance system to systemic risk after all politicians were holding the entire system hostage. The IMF realized that government bailouts CAN NOT be the way they wind down insolvent banks. The new template is the bail-in -- depositor haircuts &amp; capital controls -- from the IMF's vantage point this is much more manageable and last year's Cypress bail-in was the live test case

Interest (rate) being so low ? you do realize that is nearing 1.00% PER DAY right ? compounded daily -- now that will vary over time no doubt but just a simple 1yr daily compounded interest calculation is about 3,600% return-- an NO that is a typo -- you can calucate it yourself here:  
Now with that all being said certainly there is counterparty risk at the exchange level -- not sure anyone is making a case that counterparty risk is irrelevant but if you are a trader there can be strategies and good risk/reward on swaps -- calling something "stupid" in this context is very myopic IMO -- I will say that would be against good risk management purposes to put a high percentage on exchange if you aren't a trader or have little incentive to become one. But for those of us that DO trade there can be nice incentives like this one

Well I think that is very short-sighted to call that as the only cost -- the Fed has essentially kept the banks on life support with all the QE programs so I would it is far from so simple of a quantification -- and my question to you as what is the actual asset you think they have on their balance sheet ? It is claim against another claim -- take $100 of exposure and hedge of $98 for $2 exposure -- that $98 can then be rehypothicated down the liquidity pyramid of counterparty after counterparty -- the problems of this only rear their head and to a devasting degree when there is a run on liquidity -- I might give the PHD economists that create a model like VAR a pass -- I hope they understand the limitations of their model -- however the useage of that model most likely falls to some risk manager on credit desk that indicates simply whether he is within tolerance or outside of it -- I tend to side with Taleb that we would be better off just throwing out the models that try and quantify such complex risk and simply say there is risk -- there is a whole additional side of skin in the game but I will stop there

50% may seem high compared to the legacy system of ZIRP, savings accounts paying nill, listed bonds and stock dividend returns but the BTC market is in the world of extremistan -- one which is approaching 600% yOy so in that context a 50% annualized swap rate doesn't look so ridiculous -- my whole point is demonstrating that market dynamics for margin trading play a significant role in the pricing mechanism of the swap -- once you acknowledge that this variable IS significant then your current model breaks down --  as I have pointed out it gets more difficult to quantify -- I am sure the swap contains both a CDS component premium as well as a margin trading dynamic -- so does modeling that risk really have any merit or insight ?

@_date: 2014-03-27 19:17:56
It is important to note that there are two main drivers to political change Voice &amp; Exit: 
Exit magnifies voice so in an essence although I know the point you are trying to make the act of ""engagement" and "working within the system" has been a rather futile process especially when it comes to up-ending the entrenched powers of the incumbent state/bank relationship. So to extrapolate out a bit the act of subversion, ignoring, and routing around the damage of the bureaucratic institutions there is an element of social change that is beginning. I can side with you on the point that Bitcoin isn't necessary the end solution for the general public but is definitely putting the fear of god in the bankers to some point. I am confident that what comes out in the middle ground will be better for society as whole. I liken it to the concept of the audio CD in 1998 and then the pirates coming online(Napster, Kazaa, &amp; finally Bittorrent) -- what came out of the monopolistic $19.99CD when I just wanted one song was itunes and Spotify. This is a clear example of voice &amp; exit to bring change -- no one had enough voice to sit down with record company execs and get them to change their business model -- they had to be brought to their knees by the torrenters so they would actually negotiate with itunes or spotify

I can agree with that -- I actually know the MBS market very extensively as I physically touched thousands of securitized mortgages from Bear &amp; Lehman. For brevity I was adding the government component as their part tends to be over- looked. I tend to fault the Fed more so with artificially low interest rates because they are suppose to be the big kid in the room of children(bankers &amp; politicians) -- I am not saying the banks are innocent but the senior level execs have to dance when the music is playing (concurrent monetary &amp; fiscal policy) because they are judged on a Q to Q basis -- underperformance for share holders and they are gone.

like all industries it happens in context -- I have this feeling you are naive as to what is going on at the other exchanges to make such a claim -- you do realize that OKC has algo order types (iceberg, TWAP) -- what I think is interesting is that BitStamp is rolling this out as a "slippage" reducer -- well there is nothing better than iceberg, TWAP or another algo order type to do this versus a basic stop loss -- they also didn't even go further with OCO orders or a buy stop option -- it is simply stop loss, trailing stop -- so I really wonder what world you are living in and why r/bitcoin defends BitStamp with such ferocious zeal -- when actors in the bitcoin space stop innovating or fail to rise to the level of their competitors a community of free market activists should be punishing them in every way possible -- but I digress

Were you around Bitcoin in the Feb-March 2013 period ? The sub 30 to 266 run? Your account looks pretty new so you might just be thinking it was barely a blip on charts compared to where we are today -- there can be a chicken and egg debate that is valid concerning Cyprus but either way MSM began linking the two -- makes sense when the question on MSM that was constantly being asked at that time was how would a commoner defend against a bail-in other than stuffing cash under the mattress -- like any good MSM outlet it went looking to find another answer -- maybe it just happen that Bitcoins time had come -- either way that is how it played out

yeah I am aware of the silents but they are a huge minority -- I should clarify that the obedience I speak of in the boomers is their trust in government and incumbent institutions(Banks, MSM)  -- that is sharp contrast to the millenials that have turned their back completely and embrace alternatives and more distributed trust (social media, twitter, facebook, torrents, bitcoin obv. )
It might very well be true that the boomers took big risk but as Taleb (The Black Swan, Antifragile) would put it they had no skin in the game because the downside was socialized upon the future generations(bailouts, social security, government debt) -- that is why I look at that them as cowards and immoral

I think it is very important to clarify what the term "adoption" means in Bitcoin for it to be overtly bullish for price development -- currently the term "merchant adoption" and x business "accepting Bitcoin" have been intentionally conflated by VC/startups like Coinbase and BitPay as a marketing ploy to drive revenue of their captive and often evangelical user base of bitcoiners -- it is perfect from their perspective as they can go do a business like newegg and say hey you can lower fees using us but more importantly you will get a good bump in sales by simply saying you "accept Bitcoin" -- when as we know they directly converting to fiat and applying direct and indirect sell pressure on the PRICE of Bitcoin -- some like to say this still net bullish long term which I am still a bit skeptical of -- for next "bubble" I think most likely we are going to need to a mass influx of speculative demand ie ETF. Other would include the "killer app" that would drive consumer adoption or a global financial crisis that suddenly makes BTC a option of necessity.

I still watch the order books and action across ALL exchanges -- and if you look through my history I have pointed out bear whale for quite some time so I have been EXTRA perceptive to what has been going on at BitStamp and his actions -- anyone that trades BTC can't just look at the chart of their specific exchange -- price action doesn't occur in a void
@_date: 2014-10-07 00:11:42
Saying "controlling the markets" is taking this to the extreme -- I believe it is also a defense for long bitcoiners that have taken a massive drawdown on their holdings currently -- they don't want to face the realities that there are still many challenges currently with Bitcoin -- sell pressure from "merchant adoption" and little to no new speculative money entering the markets -- so instead they want to say the ONLY reason for prices going down IS this bear whale entity and not that he may be just kicking the leg out from under already weakly supported price action

I have also provided you with the overlay of USD swap rates to price action -- I wouldn't go so far as to say there is a correlation related to directional bias but more of a simple volatility(Vega) component -- rates tend to rise when price action breaks from periods of low vol to periods of higher vol and vise versa -- this supports my margin trader thesis that there is more demand for swaps from traders during volatile periods

Speculators are the grease in the pricess of price discovery -- if you think they are price negative I just point you to stamp's order book -- all the speculators have left and you have one bear whale controlling capping the upside, combine that with all the merchant dumps and you have little bid support versus and exchange that offers short selling like BitFinex as the shorts must place bids to cover

Merchant adoption will not in and of itself breed consumer adoption -- merchant adoption or businesses "accepting Bitcoin" is price negative because it is a market sell -- the rest of your article stating "in a couple of months" is just wishful thinking and hope -- those that panic first lose less

Today someone of the Boys and Girls club soliciting donations walked up to me on the street and I asked them if they accepted Bitcoin -- it was the typical blank spare response -- I went on to explain it and like most millennials I was cashless and had my mobile phone -- I could donate via CC but that required me to fill out long forms provide secure data of my CC and spend more time then I wanted to do it -- but had there been a bitcoin donation via QR code I could have donated $2 and been off continuing my walk home to eat sushi.
I understand what you are saying about the tax implications but those are strategic moves to reduce your tax burden -- there are avenues for that currently -- but the real power of something like blockchain technology like bitcoin is the crowdsourcing of massive amounts of mircopayments
These people standing on the corner soliciting for the boys and girls club are hoping they either find people that REALLY believe in the program and have the time to fill out the required forms or decide they need to do something for a tax write off at that time. Have you watched the way bitcoin has crowdfunded causes right here on reddit ? it is mind blowing -- and people aren't concerned about filing out some tax form to get their writeoff-- they are just donating a couple bucks worth

Yeah you have a lot of homework to do -- you are over complicating things IMO as you appear to talk yourself in circles -- margin requirements are usually pretty well spelled out -- really Bfx is tame in margin compared 10xand 20x futures on OKC and 796 -- even with that kind of leverage their systems work well(so far) to mitigate risk to the principle holder -- which is the exchange in this case and do remember these futures products have been running since before we were below $500 so they certainly have been put through the ringer of a volatile market including flash crashes on Bfx and btce

I have so many contentions with your post I have no idea where to begin -- there is a difference on where the content is originating between twitter/facebook/reddit &amp; the MSM -- one has user based content the other is a centrally managed curator that decides how they want to package the content to their audience to serve their agenda -- that has pretty large implications even on the basic assumptions that get made in the MSM even if they aren't intentional -- my point is the boomers don't question they simply believe. 
Have you read any of Taleb ? Specifically Antifragile as you did nothing to address that point that I made -- the boomers have no skin in the game if they get all the upside and socialize the downside upon future generations
The political apparatus is a reflection of what the members of the society will tolerate -- and again an obedient boomer generation that doesn't question is the result of what we are seeing today.
I see you haven't been posting in the bitcoin sub for that long so I am guessing you are basing your history on a the standard revisionist versions -- it is important not to conflate that falling prices are the cause of the Great Depression -- over-leverage and an easy money policy through the 20s sowed the seeds -- yes prices were falling but that is similar to saying that the wet pavement caused it to rain -- if you are levered up to the hilt yes a small drop in prices will result in a cascading of defaults -- but that is hardly the cause but a symptom of the larger structural problem of being mislead by the cost of money into ill investments for so long
You do realize that only one part of Glass-Stegal was repealed right ? specifically the part that maintained that investment banking and commercial banking could not be under one roof -- and the reason for that is because the other part of Glass-Stegal was the creation of the the FDIC -- issured deposits -- so if they would have repealed ALL of Glass-Stegal then they would have proper risk and reward restored -- but again the point was to be able to co-mingle the funds so that the banks could do investment banking activities with the tax payer insured money --I don't agree with but I wanted to bring this to your awareness.
Lastly I am not sure why I have to defend the free market and laissez faire capitalism -- other that to say that they have been painted as what is really crony capitalism -- a collusion between the banking cartel and government regulation -- this is very important as I have illustrated you can't define something as free market capitalism if you have no skin in the game and no downside because they have socialize that risk.

When was it available to you ? that doesn't sound like a confident statement that you really know what you are talking about if you are wishing to get into a pissing contest into the evolution of BFX and understanding of their matching engine mechanics -- the point being is BTC swaps are just another tool of the trader, no different then USD swaps, shorting, leverage, etc -- these are tools for traders and to have an post of "should you lend your BTC out on BFX" is just a silly thing to poster from the beginning -- I will sum it up in one statement: IT DEPENDS !

@_date: 2014-01-14 16:38:22
Secondly I have become much better at defending Bitcoin on the "but what about my CC rewards" contention -- I give the guys at Gyft a lot of credit -- because what people don't realize is that merchants already bake in the 3-5% CC fees into all their products -- then they will offer Gift cards to a company like Gyft at say a 5% discount -- Gyft then allows Bitcoin users to get 3% back -- although yes Gyft could be completely cut out of the situation and it would make things a little easier I don't see this as a real viable excuse compared to CCs -- I have friends that plan their weeks and study their CC rewards so they know what day they need to use what card to maximize they reward point getting -- there are whole websites dedicated to this -- going forward though if we can get more merchants to separate their prices like this and bring awareness adoption could really take off

It still boggles my mind that you are completely ignoring the demand side coming from the margin traders themselves -- the large spikes in margin rates are market movement related as news hype surrounds bitcoin and margin traders load up on longs from fear of missing out (FOMO) -- so again there are more dynamics at play then solely the CDS of the exchange

That is shutting out a key pool of demand interest though -- speculative demand is very real in serving the purpose of price discovery and creating larger and larger pools of liquidity. Speculative demand shouldn't be a "dirty word". With that said simply "exchanging" and moving BTC into cold storage isn't a viable option for active traders.

I do think there are good points in the Citi article -- granted they have been articulated before by Jimmy from Gyft and others -- merchant adoption is net positive the technology but at least near to middle term price bearish -- namely because BTC is functioning as a payment protocol solely and both store of value or speculative demand barely trickling in context

I am pretty sure an all caps and bold response constitutes angry screaming so good luck defending that -- but again so what if wash sales occur (and you can do them on BFX as well which you haven't addressed) -- you make these feigned outraged posts like we should all agree that this is so terrible -- oh the horrors lol
I know your are going to try and pull this back into your circular argument that wash sales are "manipulation" -- which you are going to have to get much more specific about as you keep that point vague so I finally threw you a bone -- it can paint volume weighted indicators and try and skew chart watchers at critical support and resistance levels but again this just a function of understanding that you are looking at a no fee exchange

I have been arguing with him over this -- the CDS component is no doubt a party of swap rate but he is completely ignoring the market driven supply and demand of margin traders that have more appetite for margin as BTC moves from periods of low volatility to higher volatility -- once you acknowledge this component is significant his model is worthless -- trying to quantify that risk is very difficult if not impossible yet he is so invested in his model and reputation that he is fighting tooth and nail to rationalize it

there are some other solutions coming online -- namely CFD swaps with insurance-like companies that want to collect a premium for hedging the swings of BTC for merchants that do accept it &amp; then would hold it directly
|the only way to mitigate the risk is for more hands to hold it to spread the currency around
you might be right currently but the trade-off I think is pretty clear -- either we take decades for that stability to be sufficient enough for larger adoption waves of directly accepting BTC or we use BTC for it's advantages as a medium exchange and payment protocol currently which paves the way for further uses as a money or store of value down the road. You seem very shortsighted to think that is going to magically happen one day -- there is a process to onboarding. Also understand the risk of leaving it to "time" and the chances of those involved in Bitcoin (core devs etc) fade away and the project lays dormant 
The truth of the matter is that Bitcoin is growing up -- for some of the idealists this is infuriating to see some aspect of co-option that is being fought currently -- but in the end it benefits society at large as it pulls the pendulum of control from status quo incumbents to a flatter platform for individuals to engage each other. The same way the internet changed the way we consume media from massive organizations acting as disseminators of truisms to bloggers and other social media that gives everyone an equal chance at expressing their opinions. 
No one said this is going to be easy but as always with open source try and create another alt-coin and spearhead your operation by engaging zero merchant processors. If you are right the market will reward your views
@_date: 2014-10-27 21:44:29

I think you are essentially spot on with your post -- it takes time for creatures of habit to change their habits if they don't have a fundamental reason to go above and beyond like in the case of Bitcoin. You are completely right that is still a niche a segment of the population from a consumer standpoint. I think with merchant adoption outpacing consumer adoption you also have many of the bitcoin faithful wanting to spend their bitcoins at these businesses but also splurge and patronize them heavily. The resulting effect is downward pressure on prices as almost all of these merchants use Bitpay or Coinbase to convert.

You can pretend it doesn't matter and if you are a long time holder it really doesn't -- but for us day traders and seeking price discovery roadblocks and avenues are the life blood of liquidity that drives price action-- don't get upset that this is being flushed out of the system -- it is just normal market digestion.

How can I answer a question that is of something that I didn't mean in my post though? -- this is reddit people are open to how they interpret things that are posted but that wasn't my intention so he is asking a question based upon a reaching assumption that I didn't make -- ie that I need to provide evidence that one whale is controlling all exchanges -- that isn't what I said or suggested in the post -- only that he is certainly on BitStamp and very likely BFX (based on his ask cluster signatures)-- that said that doesn't mean or should be assumed the dumps on other exchanges are his or not because he uses BitStamp as his primary wrench to bully the markets. Not sure why what I have said needs to be jumped to such a conclusion that this whales controls all -- what I have and CONTINUE to do is not avoid the question but articulate what my original assertion has been -- for some reason he seems to have gotten into his head that what I have said means "one whale controls them all" and he can't shake that out of head so Idk what is much else to say

So the exchanges and the off book swap agreements don't happen in a vacuum -- supply and demand isn't contained to just what he see on the exchanges and end up just being a microcosm of global trade. So the off book pricing satisfies that supply and demand that would otherwise might spill over into the listed exchanges. I think we all recognize that this is fine even some people of the community pout about this that it should all be going through the exchanges but that is a bit too much of monolithic view and would not really be enforceable anyway

I have listened to Peter for the last 4 years consistently and I am very aware of his debate with Erik Voorhees (namely because I was the one that set it up via Reddit) -- with that said I think Peter focuses specifically on bitcoin price( of the currency) and the payment protocol as two different things -- I think there is a decent case to be made here especially when that is effectively what BitPay and Coinbase are doing -- that direct conversion to fiat creates continued downward pressure price pressure -- and although many of the Bitcoin zealots want to see X business "accept bitcoin" they are really victims of a GREAT marketing campaign by the processors to get fanatical bitcoiners to do their work for them -- this is a tech concept pioneered by Paul Graham out of Y-combinator, simply put don't create a product that a large group of people like -- instead create a product that a small group of people absolutely love and allow that base to drive momentum

I have put a tremendous amount of thought in what Bitcoin needs to move into the Brink and Mortar POS side of things -- currently you are absolutely correct that CCs are actually quite frictionless there -- online is a totally different story and I think that is why Bitcoin usage is growing much more quickly there -- I am not going to offer out any solutions but I think much of the checkout experience is going to be changing and with that entrepreneurs will have a lot of incentives to create a seemless user interface. Bitcoin is still very raw for the at large public -- but also remember the population is in dynamic change -- the baby boomers are retiring and dying and will be less of an influence as the tech-savvy millennials rise to full force -- you only need to look to dying MSM to see that change is coming into full force

I wouldn't be so quick to call them a tiny minority with the way the Republican old guard establishment is being dismantled as libertarian ideals spread through it like a replicating virus. With that said my personal libertarian views are a pursuit of smaller and more local government -- I look at as an asymptote to use a mathematical definition where you push toward an ever DEcreasing/irrelevant role of the state but you can't actually achieve it hence the asymptote

What are your thoughts on the NYDFS regulations and how would it effect BitPay -- seems that they want to get the payment processors pound of flesh as well as wanting profits to be held in USD which doesn't make sense. Would this also deter future companies from holding a percentage of BTC VS converting it all. Sorry for the rambling

@_date: 2014-05-14 22:53:53
I said that I agreed with you in one aspect (the tax write-off crowd prespective)-- I believe your missing the point of microdonations here as a more leveraged funding model for non-profits. I look at it the same way crowdfunding is taking form today (and what it will look like with blockchain tech) as a guiding light -- non-profits like start-ups historically looked to court high net value individuals to fund their visions or companies -- that model is being distributed in the crowdfunding approach and has unlocked another key way to fund those operations that doesn't require a couple of rich dudes giving the thumbs up or down on those projects. If you don't see this trend forming then I really have nothing else to say -- the VCs and the big donors will still very much be a part but this is a growing model that more start-ups and non-profits can tap into
@_date: 2014-08-10 10:07:04


In hindsight of course after the model has blown up.
And lastly I will agree with you that Bitfinex should probably articulate the risks to swap providers on that if the central counterparty would go bankrupt then loss of all or most of the funds is definitely in the cards. But they aren't really misleading as they have to this date covered any and all losses to swap provider it just comes back to our counterparty discussion.
Is their statement really any different then a money back guarantee from an electronics company that goes out of business before you can return your faulty piece of equipment ? 
@_date: 2014-05-14 23:03:16
And YES the method of receiving said donation CAN be a factor -- a transaction is an act of free speech -- and it may impede on certain beliefs one holds. Wikileaks was a pretty strong case for choosing a censorship-resistant form of payment. I can provide other examples but choosing whether to donate or not to donate based on their payment methods is definitely a valid reason -- to say it is irrelevant is very shortsighted in what we are dealing with here

There are securities that are exempt from the wash sale though -- namely those that fall under section 1256 contracts (index ETFs, futures, index options, non-convertible securities) -- with that said I am not exactly sure where Bitcoin would fall
@_date: 2014-08-10 15:41:03
I think this whole argument has really gotten into the weeds -- you have issues with the way they worded their description of swaps -- and to a point I think we agree that they could have done a more balanced approach in listing some of the risks rather than their tongue and cheek 9 word description -- I will say that they do still claim to be beta with the website so that should arise caveat emptor-- with that side it still doesn't make up for sad attempt at quantifying risk and I have stated at nauseam that is very difficult if not impossible to quantify it -- so your 40-50% default risk is literally pulled out your ass and paraded around like it is an exact science in your piece.

@_date: 2014-06-12 15:23:27
I assure you the traders do care -- say what you want to say about us but we disseminate the information that both NO ONE wants to hear and EVERYONE wants to hear -- that is the marketplace of information -- price discovery can only happen when this channel is fluid as possible -- the good comes with the bad otherwise we are back to MSM 
@_date: 2014-01-14 20:04:52
To some extent you are right but you frame it in a somewhat malicious way -- reminds me of the way "price gouging" is framed for someone selling ice for $20/lb right after a hurricane... but I digress slightly -- what will happen is price discovery will drive more competitive pricing between existing merchants and payment options VS the bullying of the past that forced merchants not to be able to offer different pricing. I do agree with you there is a large hill to climb over the establishment CC network -- but isn't that why we are here debating this or have interest in Bitcoin ? I am not so pessimistic on your consumer outlook -- it my opinion they are quite aware of nominal differences in pricing and rewards based systems as many of my friends go to great links to plan when they need to use what CC and when to maximize all their different complex rewards -- the price of gas is the MOST watched and visible price in an everyday consumer's life -- having two different prices will raise a lot of questions in their consciousness as well as remind them of cost savings -- the millennial generation is increasingly cashless but they will be more tech and bitcoin savvy so it will be a gradual transition

it really can depend on what kind of fill you get -- it varies widely -- even so it is just another tool for a trader to add to their toolbox -- nothing more and nothing less -- if it can be utilized it will be. To those that don't understand, aren't traders, and enjoy the piece of mind of having all their coins in cold storage then by all means stay within the elements that you are comfortable with -- but don't go advising other people that might be trading orientated and have MUCH more experience then you do with the concept of counterparty risk what they should and should NOT do -- if you are a trader you understand the risk you are taking with the counterparty -- not sure why this gets so much attention when compared to any other risk metric

shorting BTC over the last 10+ months has been very profitable -- and as such we CONTINUE in a downtrend until those technical breaks happen -- with that said I am trader and I expose my capital (either long or short) when good risk/reward presents itself -- there has been just as much profit potential with 10x leveraged futures to make big money in the downtrend via shorting as there was during the November bubble -- someone on here said "I would not like to be 10x short when price turns around" -- and I agree, either would I, but that is why I am trader -- I have no dogmatic views as far as where price is going to go -- only to say that I trade what is front of me -- nothing more and nothing less

well that is a bit of strawman argument to justify eternal strength -- I think what the post is trying to illustrate that at times the pace of supply coming onto the markets is outpacing the demand -- this does seem to make sense when we see daily many more merchants accepting it yet the consumer uptake is lagging behind. I think we all here are glad to see the trend of more businesses accepting bitcoin but many people are freaking out why it isn't reflected positively in the price -- point is there are different forces at work here that are not directly demand side related

Something tells me you are a bitcoin purist -- interesting that you argue against free market price discovery in any form(including day traders and bots) -- which as trader myself I have get texts/ messages hours to days later from friends "did you hear such and such happened to bitcoin" yes US traders new about AS it was happening and adjusted price -- more importantly the purist chest thumping that want big merchants accepting BTC where does the liquidity come from to handle those transactions -- the companies are going to at least convert some if not all to BTC to fiat and need a liquid instrument -- do some critical thinking about this for awhile and it might dawn on you -- or we can go to the Soviet model of central planning price setting -- didn't work so well

I believe that bitcoiners have been hoodwinked by the likes of Bitpay and Coinbase in a grand marketing ploy -- they make the deals with big merchants for the publicity that they "accept bitcoin" even though they get fiat and the bitcoin fanatics flock to the merchants due to blind devotion to the cause
I can't find the exact quote from Paul Graham the founder of y-combinator but he really does a good job of articulating what is going on in the bitcoin ecosystem with the payment processors -- essentially he states that don't create a product that A LOT of people love, instead create a product that a niche group is consumed by and that will be devoted marketing deal going forward. Here is a descent article where he hits on some of these points:

For your second point we could get deep into the weeds --  I do want to articulate ONE important aspect -- not ALL of Glass-Steagall was repealed -- only the provision that kept commercial banking and investment banking entities separate -- the other part of Glass-Steagall was the creation of the FDIC and depositor insurance -- so the call to "de-regulate" would have been fine if it in fact repealed ALL of the GS -- instead they got to use government insured deposits to gamble with in IB

It can work if it is "cash secured" or this case "BTC secured" you can look up cash secured put and you will understand -- a trust less derivatives market in bitcoin only works if the collateral is secured within the blockchain -- any other way brings in counterparty/"trusted" 3rd party risk

Your example is grossly simplistic and naive -- something tells me you have very little financial markets background beyond watching CNBC from time to time -- an algorithm is far more complex then that and as in the May 2011 flash crash it was these liquidity providers that pulled back and exasperated the sell off -- not the other way around -- also could you elaborate specifically on a market that functions '"just fine" (whatever that means) without algorithms involved ? It saddens me to see someone of the bitcoin community latch on to mainstream financial news FUD and talking points -- the "evil" speculators are a lubricant that greases the pricing mechanism in a world of imperfect information -- that is quintessential to making a market as fair as possible -- otherwise go back to the Soviet union of $1 shoes -- guess what the quality of shows declined and the ones that were of better quality were sold into a black market -- just the market attempting to clear itself

But I am not familiar with the specific product to assert whether it is the best potential setup.

It was just a mental gymnastics exercise using the compound interest calculator set to daily -- ie compounded daily which is what BFX does -- I have been on BFX since they began operations and I am often able to get fills well above the averages (there are also bots for this if you do some searching) -- there have been times where my interest rate has exceeded 7000% annualized before compounding and before they introduced certain parameters you had to adhere to. So again it is really up to the skill of the person behind the screen --  I can get behind your argument as a general consensus -- having dealt with many bitcoiners from the meet-up group that I run I would advise most of them to just keep their coins in cold storage and not think about trading/using swaps -- it is just beyond their understanding or skill set and far easier for them to get in trouble then just staying put in cold storage -- but it isn't a one size fits all approach and to those that can utilize it they will -- probably not for Joe er though

Some of the regulations contribute though -- such things as counting MBS at par with Treasury paper for Basal 3. I could go on forever the way the US politicians legislated policy to encourage more &amp; more subprime mortgages. Regulation is not a panacea when those regulations can modeled by the large incumbents -- greed is constant through out mankind -- but risk is has been altered, in the US case there was no downside for US bank execs to engage in the activities as they were too big to fail ie assured tax payer bailouts; market discipline was not able to exert forces as there was not appropriate risk on the line for US bankers. I don't think a comparison with Australia is that easy because of these circumstances

Bitcoin risk prevention progress
Under the urging of the central bank, commercial banks and payment institutions bitcoins have to make the appropriate risk prevention work. As of May 12, there are already 13 banks (including five state-owned commercial banks and joint-stock commercial banks mostly) and partial payment institutions announcement, which means that no longer is Bitcoin, Wright coins and other recharge and withdrawals, as well as buying and selling recharge service code.
In addition, the Central Bank of Bitcoin trading site and recharge code trading site, agent-related accounts have also been disposed of, and strive to cut off the transfer path bitcoin trading funds. Payment Clearing Association members also Bitcoin Chinese fire coins nets 15 bitcoin trading site payment methods were reviewed to exclude the possibility of access to the network of institutions to become merchants, and to review the results of feedback to payment Clearing Association.

I am pretty sure Nassim Taleb would take what ever calculations you are trying to quantify for systemic/counter party risk and throw them out the window -- truth is they CAN'T be quantified so we should just stop pretending we can come up with a nice number that represents "Value At Risk" -- it must be done purely at the exposure level -- and if I can expose 10% of my BTC holdings for trading with the knowledge of counterparty risk being VERY palpable with an exchange then I am as close to proper risk management as I can get -- include certain take profit/ transfer off exchange protocols and you can further move to entirely playing with house money ie for every 2BTCs I make I send 1BTC back to cold storage etc
Also why would anyone in their right mind NOT consider counter party risk as an element of their trading strategy ? To me that just sounds like naivety more than anything else -- and as I point out above there ARE profitable strategies -- you just haven't thought critically enough about it seems and as I have stated before: Joe r/bitcoin er probably shouldn't be dabbling on the exchanges based upon your statements and encounters I have had with similar people that haven't thought critically on risk management

Do not attempt to put words in my mouth that I have not explicitly stated -- it makes your argument look infantile and try hard to make such a claim -- you seem stuck on this paternalistic crusade to save those naive traders/speculators from thinking there is no risk on Bitfinex and that those providing swap liquidity are a different class of people then those trading there on margin -- they are often the same people because the swap functions as a makeshift short premium trade during slower markets to provide one example. Anyone after the Mtgox meltdown that does assume counterparty risk on an exchange has been living on another planet.
If prices aren't right then I am getting scammed as a trader ? Do we even need to have an efficient markets talk on asymmetric information ? Either way a trader that is going long and needs to tap USD margin should be looking for short term setups to minimize exposure to swap costs -- until recently with the opening of OKCoin's futures market bfx was providing slightly more leverage at a competitive rate to OKCoin and Huobi which both have a similar p2p swap book
On your point about why don't they charge a fixed rate I actually think allowing market actors to participate in a crowd funded margin desk on rates they get to set is a rather innovative feature -- not only is it a form of dynamic pricing and you can see the data of the spikes around previous market events (  ) but it also provides more transparency into what is going on in the exchange then a closed desk model

Very interesting -- yeah if someone more knowledgeable on this matter could comment that would be very insightful -- does seem some aspect of government blessing -- and I know the Bitcoin community hates hearing it framed that way but it does generate the influx of capital that I think most of us do want to see for crossing the chasm into mainstream adoption
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:09:29
This isn't about luck -- this is purely a function of risk management -- I want you to describe to me how this ISN'T a good risk mitigation strategy -- if you continue to say "history says exchanges fail you will get burned" then again you just lack any understanding of risk management -- risk is not to be eliminated if that makes sense it only needs to be skewed so that there a positive risk adjusted return -- I am not sure how those that claim to be bitcoiners do not understand this -- risk can not and should not be eliminated otherwise why would you be placing a bet essentially on bitcoins future ?

There are derivative markets popping up now (Atlas ATS &amp; Tera Group) that have data servers running along side of the New Jersey HFT firms which gives them greater credibility in the uncertain BTC exchange world we currently live in. It will take some time to get the liquidity in these markets to provide hedging vehicles for these institutional level clients but it is definitely in the works. Institutions (namely Hedge funds at this point) see volatility as a double edged sword -- it can act as a non correlated asset or add to their overall portfolio as they seek more alpha. Remember the institutions only view BTC as a financial instrument and how it fits into their quarter to quarter performance and exposure -- it isn't necessarily true that they dislike the volatility what they truly dislike is the lack of liquidity to manage their positions (they do go hand in hand to a point).
"Traditional markets have controls in place to avoid manipulation," -- well  I think you have little understanding of how the listed world works here, although HFTs in general are good for liquidity that doesn't mean that certain firms aren't getting some special treatment (quote jumping, quote stuffing), and there is plenty of cases of bear raids in the stocks where HFTs don't run wild. So to say there are protections in place shows a lack of understanding of the trading systems involved here. At the end of the day we realize that a market based price of self-interested individuals is far better than a central declaration of what the price SHOULD be with 0 volatility

I like to often point people to the s-curve adoption graph -- too many people try and say "oh my god so volatile" because of their years of staring at google finance charts -- if we actually had a chart of price discovery and valuation of any known tech company today (Facebook, Twitter, Google) and really any company for that matter the early days would have pricing all over the place. Many don't realize what they see today on Google finance charts is only the public history of the company at the latter half of the adoption curve where VC are punching out at IPO

Oh where should I begin because now it is my turn to call YOU OUT -- I have admitted it -- can't provide hard proof [DONE] but again you can smell the exhaust of my benz [ and we can have a discussion over drinks if that if your fancy-- markets and trading don't work on PERFECT information -- they never will -- but there certainly are opportunities there.
My contention is the similar nature of the OHCC and my post -- well articulated but difficult if not impossible to prove -- yet you as a mod of (which you made me aware of AFTER I linked to flibbr's post -- your response was that because you were a mod you were "quite aware" of what is going on over at bitcoinmarkets).
Unlike you that has a job as mod to be aware of what is going on your sub-reddit I don't always have the time to comment and seeing that OKC CTO already was on there defending I saw little need to defend them -- but I did speak to  Zane (OKC Director of Int. Operations) about it off reddit - which IMO was a better way then doing it on the troll heaven that is reddit. 
I will admit I don't think his post SHOULD be censored (because I don't believe in ANY kind of censorship) however YOU clearly do believe in censorship as to what you did with this post :
 (Hi While I'd love this world to be a place where we can blindly believe what people say on the internet, sadly, we don't live in that world. Please submit me some shred of proof and I'll reapprove this post (and remove this comment)
The reason it is upvoted is because the majority of BTC bagholding longs want someone to scapegoat for their pain -- and since the "China banning" had already left a bad taste in their mouth and on their balance sheets this was a great conspiracy theory to place more of the blame on prices crashing on something out of their control -- interesting to see the mods stay silent yet OKC CTO is calling the bullshit out ON REDDIT on THAT POST 
Instead although my post might be an interesting exercise to ponder -- his OHCC post explicitly generates fear, fear turns into anger, anger turns into hate.

Interesting that you dissect everything that I just dissected after complaining that I was reading into and projecting to what you said only to then project on what you think I mean -- you are correct though that reddit just becomes an often exhaustive exercise of unfucking assumptions and that is why you can find me on trader team speak -- it by no means is specifically trader only discussion but if you want to actually have a discussion rather than re-arming and preparing the next cannonball shot as reddit responses often are you can me and others there.

Do you trade at all ? You have a very naive and superficial sense of market dynamics -- my guess is you looked at some technical analysis 101 tutorials and then tried trading it as gospel -- RSI oversold full margin long, test of support buy margin long. Technical Analysis is about raising the prospects of a higher percentage trade entry or exit -- nothing more or nothing less -- and the honest conclusion of a trader is that he is still going to be wrong roughly 50% of the time(and many people can't deal with the emotional issues associated with that) but the degrees of wrong from a lot size &amp; risk management perspective can determine those that trade another day and the ones that say they tried technical analysis and that doesn't work against algos

Aren't you overlooking a key component of counterparty risk though ? Certainly gross level exposure is drastically overstating but it is not net exposure either as some courterparties will default as well -- and this is far from negligible as according to VAR all bank MBS &amp; CDS were still within the risk profile leading into the GFC

I would also point you over to /BitcoinMarkets -- your question is a little too over simplistic -- you sound like someone who spent a couple weeks trading a volatile BTC time and think you're a Wall Street all-star -- you will probably just end up churning your account during the consolidation periods -- there is no easy way to learn these things other then just putting money at risk and experiencing it -- most traders need to blow out their account several times before they put proper risk management plans in place to protect their capital from themselves

More importantly as an options &amp; derivatives trader of 7 years and BTC trader for 2 years I question even your calculations of being majorily shortsighted -- saying that annualized risk rate is 39% compared to UST is a bit nonsense as the swap rate isn't a CDS-- it may very well contain a CDS premium in it though but the larger driver of rates is demand for USD(long sided) margin -- if you think I am blowing hot air then go take a look at the BTC swap(shorting BTC) side -- off the cuff it has been in the 0.0055% area -- so where is your CDS premium there ?

You missed my POINT -- as well as I now noticed this is a link to your own write-up -- it is generally frowned upon to post click bait to your own website per reddit guidelines but that is another debate -- you also responded with that you "don't THINK" -- so in other words you DON'T KNOW -- as a payment processor that needs to access BTC liquidity it would be fiscal negligence to NOT have relationships with exchanges -- they would intentionally be ignoring a great source of liquidity to hedge off some of their risk so I believe this is a non-sense argument -- and I DO think they have stated that they have relationships with exchanges but do source their liquidity through many means.
So EVEN with all that said I come back to my original post -- it really doesn't matter if ALL merchant processors are doing off exchange transactions if I want to assume you are correct -- that is STILL market information that is being priced in and will have negative pricing pressure -- it might be debatable that it has less effect then market sells over the listed exchanges but AGAIN the listed markets DO NOT live a void and that price pressure will be reflected

This is pretty big news and probably will be slightly overshadowed on the sub-reddit -- many people don't like the concept of HFT but this is what will provide the liquidity &amp; infrastructure for those very large institutions to dump the billions of dollars we all want to see into the BTC &amp; crypto markets. Secondly I do think BTC has redefined "market hours" but I will say it is good for an exchange to have at least some scheduled downtime during the week so that normal maintenance and upgrades can be done without everyone freaking out on why the "exchange is down"

there might be some merits to your argument but you have to accept the world we live in -- many of the mainstream doesn't share our ideological view though to make the jump for that progress -- right now all we can say is that Bitcoin represents a great medium of exchange and payment protocol but the risk is too great for merchants to hold it for accounting purposes etc

I am definitely team Mike Hearn -- keep up the good work
@_date: 2014-07-09 16:06:21
I am just going speak from direct experience as your statements I feel are a bit out of touch with reality -- as of 2010 nearly ALL Student loans are being originated out of Dept of Ed or the quasi-government agency Sallie Mae (   "The new law will eliminate fees paid to private banks to act as intermediaries in providing loans to college students" -- I worked at Wells Fargo in the servicing department and they completely eliminated the student loan department -- student loans were merged into general consumer loans and are made very rarely on a case to case basis. This is a trend across all big banks ( "The federal government now issues 93 percent of student loans."
Secondly, at 18-19 years old you shouldn't be expected to decide the rest of your 40+ year career -- there is still a ton of change going on as you experience the world outside of the bubble that was likely your small town high school -- and to think at that age kids are running up $100k+ as they still explore is a true failure of society to recognize many mistakes and missteps that happen that age. But that is also the beauty of being that age and the self exploration so don't try and justify that she can't change her mind and change it often -- she is trying to figure shit out -- that process in and of itself is not efficient but necessary
Have you listened to the Peter Schiff Show interview ? She said flat out that she wouldn't have been doing porn if college was affordable by waiting tables on the weekend. The tuitions have been bid into the stratosphere because the government aide just keeps flowing --  it has distorted the market and there is no demand side market force to keep the bloating adminstrations from piling in as much goodies into the college tuitions as they can. "There is lots of ways a young person can make $200k?" Even assuming $50k a year working full time with a full time class load ? Not even close

just because they adamantly recommend against having coins on exchange(and I would tend to agree for non-traders) doesn't mean it doesn't fit into ones overall crypto risk management or diversity strategy -- take for example OKC's 10x leverage futures market -- I could choose to expose 10% of the amount of my cold storage wallet to effectively hedge off risk associated with the volatile nature of BTC when wanting to be in fiat for some period of time, in essence they give you that ability without the need to fully expose yourself -- rather than having to send ALL of my cold storage coins to an exchange to convert to fiat if I was wanting to I could it with only 10% of that amount

Per Bitfinex terms and agreements they are covering any loss of principle in those scenarios (insured swaps)-- let me reiterate though that this means counterparty risk at the exchange level is certainly palipable -- whether it be systemic in cascading margin calls that results in company bankruptcy, hacking or government regulatory hazard that will also result in loss of principle

You're statement rings of monolithic view that is blatantly naive-- the hedge fund community is FAR from homogeneous in their risk and investment strategies -- yes there are some funds that do foreign bonds and equities that are for conservative high net worth individuals -- usually from high middle management at fortune 500 companies -- these investors are inherently pragmatists and seek fund managers cut from the same cloth -- however there are tech rich with successful exits that want hedge managers that are of the non rank and file -- these kind of esoteric leaning funds have been gaining ground over the stuffy cigar image you probably have in your head.

read the articles posted -- Sallie Mae is as private as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae -- they are quasi-government -- and regardless although they are allowing Sallie Mae to service the loans they are still being counted as originating from the US government -- ie government-backed. You are very naive and have no understanding of the student loan situation -- maybe that is blessing if you have avoided the mess entirely
what is most important is that Sallie Mae can garnish wages of default student loans WITHOUT a court order -- not even the banks can do that -- that is a sole power of the US Government -- not tell me again how they are private agency ?

there are a number of products he could be using -- he does use bfx so he could short 3.3:1 leverage -- or there is 10x on OKC and 20x on 796 -- I am not entirely sure what your background is but I do notice many on this sub-reddit don't understand the concept of going short or leveraged short -- you can google around to grasp a greater understanding but it is essentially profiting from price going down -- add leverage and it makes sense -- he is not simply "selling at low price" -- it is very possible that during that large ask wall he had on BitStamp he was buying his own wall back to give the illusion of bullish pressure building so that it would pop once it was eaten through -- this has happened with other ask walls that got eaten and a big pop ensued -- so it isn't so simple -- many people say why would a rational person do this -- point is he isn't -- this is the gaming that goes on in trading and playing moves off the perception 
Edit: also the fact he has generated NUMEROUS margin calls from BFX leveraged longs over the last couple of week -- this is a giant pinata of opportunities for him -- volatility generates profits for him

I have seen a kind of response similar to yours as the Bitcoin community has expanded since the last run-up. I credit Peter as the one who introduced me to Austrian Economics and sound money &amp; I think many people share that experience with me. There is a DIRECT link to those ideas and the early days of both Bitcoin &amp; the Internet as a whole. Having listened to Peter's radio show for about 4 years now I have noticed I have become very put off by his attitudes toward Bitcoin. I am not saying he "has to change" but there was a trend where people in the hard money community were falling quickly to their scepticisms &amp; embracing BTC (Jeffrey Tucker, Stephan Molenuix, Tom Woods, Ed &amp; Ethan, Future Money Trends, etc)

Subprime was government induced though -- not just complacent but actively legislating to get banks to make subprime loans.

Now you are you are circling back to paternalism -- your modeling and analysis is in tatters and had you been a diligent and articulate economist you would have elaborated on the basic assumptions of the model and it's limitations -- instead you rushed through the calculations and conclusions in a "sky is falling" kind of way -- if we hold counterparty risk constant between swaps and BTC trading (since the funds are on the same exchange) then actually trading BTC IS more risky than swaps -- however holding BTC in an offline cold storage wallet might very well be LESS risky then both of the above, you have model a different kind of risk like forgetting your password or misplacing your private keys

I will humor your huffyness for a moment and give ode to the saying "Fake it till you make it" actually holds completely true as far volume and trader preferences are concerned -- it is in fact that perception BECOMES reality -- go over to Kraken and watch the 5 trades that go across the book in 5 minutes -- I am sure they will constitute for being "real" in your book -- but as a trader I still would rather trade on an exchange that appears to have more volume than one that surely has no volume because I know the power of self filling prophecies in trading -- just along the lines of TA I know if other traders think OKC has liquidity they will go there so in turn I will go there because I know they are going there. 
I don't really expect you to understand this as it is a very genuis business model that your myopic mind is I am sure unable to comprehend. You will just keep stomping your foot over "fake this take that" on the lines of what pit traders said when the NASDAQ first came online -- "how can that hocus pocus electronic trading stuff be real" -- trade can only be official if two people are spitting in each others faces and shake hands over it lulz

I could be wrong but I believe you do need somewhat of an idea of what the password is when you consult their services Edit: from their website "If you have no idea at all of your passphrase, and it was more than a handful of characters long, then we cannot help you. No-one in the world, including the NSA, CIA, D-Wave or anyone else can crack the encryption used in the bitcoin wallet if the passphrase is more than 15 fairly random characters. The bitcoin wallet encryption is strong by design. There are no known flaws in the implementation, and many people have tried to break it!"

Trace Mayer does a good job of talking about this -- the reason that Bitcoin has so much leverage against the state is no amount of violence can forcefully deprive you of your property -- physical property (gold, silver, real estate) &amp; of course bank accounts can be taken at will because the government has more guns and firepower -- I suppose you could make a stand with a .44 mag from the local police over your silver coins but eventually you will lose. With cryptography they will have to literally torture it out of you -- I am not willing go that alarmist and I fully believe the viral nature of twitter and youtube camera videos is a great tool for the citizens that have physical acts of violence committed against them -- the state has become far more stealthy with financial violence but Bitcoin upends all that -- and at least here in the US the financial acts of violence is the states main tool

|Once that balance shifts, and more consumers want/use Bitcoin, demand will outpace supply, therefore pushing the price back up.

I make way more as a trader then any possible affiliate like position so it really isn't worth my time to "schill" -- what is worth my time though is getting all the features and tools I want out of the exchange platform that I am using to take my business (as in trading business) to the next level -- I (and those around me on TeamSpeak) demand these things and currently OKC has been best at engaging and incorporating these things(stops, better UI, 20x leverage, reward point revamp)  -- with that said I and the other traders are far from satisfied and want more implementations -- we will continue to engage them so far as we see value from it. It isn't a monolithic industry -- things change and us traders are fickle, presumed alligences die quickly it just so happens at this time that they appear to be leading (but far from perfect)

The fact that Bitstamp released an address book and called that "innovation" confirmed my doubts that they have any talent over there from,a startup perspective -- I suppose they could say they are winning invasive AML/KYC battle -- but their exchange is near lifeless and most the USD lead months ago to BFX-- even BFX is having traders leave in mass to Huobi and OKCoin -- they just have superior platforms and products from a traders perspective

Actually yes -- that NewEgg sale was MASSIVELY bearish that weekend -- price nosedived as current BTC holders flocked like turkeys to spend their BTC to save 30% -- think about that -- they could now sometime in the future buy bitcoin and as long as price hadn't risen 30% they lost no purchasing power-- this is a scenario where the payment processor(BitPay/Coinbase) has the obligation and NOT the option on when to find fiat (near instantly) for the merchant while the consumer(spender) has the option but NOT the obligation on when to buy back bitcoins -- this is price negative -- and are you really going to debate on paypal ?-- down about $70USD since that announcement -- somewhere there is an equilibrium where these forces balance -- I believe it is much lower as more merchants get involved -- hence why shorting BTC can be a worthwhile strategy

So you assume that just because they are short that they are "Bitcoin trolls" --  active traders like myself simply trade the instrument and yes at times I am short -- also Bitcoin idealists and evangelicals need to face the sobering reality that Bitcoin has a very long and difficult road ahead of it which can impact the price a long the way -- you actually want short sellers to bring out as much legitimate concerns as well FUD and smear campaigns -- it is only then with immense about of energy to cause harm can Bitcoin ultimately become antifragile

I am not sure if you are familiar with US investment laws so forgive me a minute for the overview -- but in the US they still cling to the "accredited investor" standard to allow equity investments (min $250k liquid, net worth $1million) -- right now crowdfunding is in this weird middleland where you can fund projects via pre-sales or some novel incentive but the US SEC doesn't allow them to offer equity through these platforms. It is much the rage over how blockchain tech and bitcoin will influence this going forward -- that is still TBD but essentially it the regulation that isn't allowing crowdfunding in the US at least to be an equity based model

American government schools -- *sighs* -- but I really think we have a difference of view points here -- payment method is an important aspect to the decision making process for me -- there is a rooted ideological factor (using USD, Paypal, Visa, Mastercard is a support for blood dollars of the state in both their nation building activities &amp; crony friends) so in essence I am placing a vote against those ideas by using Bitcoin. 
You do have a solid point regarding crowdfunding but I find it hard to swallow the "investor safety" argument to throw it out just on those means -- I prefer to be in a buyer beware world because I value innovation over the cries for "investor safety" -- in my opinion most of the cries are feigned outrage so that the fat cats can have their pick of the litter on the start-ups they see -- average joe at best can get in at IPO and hope it goes up another 10% as the early VCs dump for 100x returns.

Well the concept of home "ownership", is actually a myth because you never really " own" it out right even if paid off with property taxes never ending -- residential real estate is just another asset class -- what I can say for certain is it isn't financially prudent that you lever up 10:1 on residential real estate (which is what you are doing with a mortgage) if you aren't already diversified in your investment portfolio

I have some disagreement with you -- but thanks for clarifying -- both Coinbase and Bitpay have different ways of going about converting BTC to USD for customers -- they do go out on the exchanges but often they do some dark pool swap equivalent and my guess is they are working with Second Market or the likes to move many coins to satisfy some institutional investment demand. This undoubtedly reduces the bid in the market on the exchanges.

Well the max leverage is 2.5:1 on bfx but that just points out more of your naivety -- I do see your point that someone could come in with less exposure overall and use that to lever up on borrowed funds -- a good trader isn't going to be max levering though -- they will utilize sparingly and their BTC or USD as collateral remains at risk -- they could also go short have the BTC price crash and realized a massive gain only to have the exchange go bankrupt -- again you are trying to analyze snapshots in a dynamic market with more variables then you can model.

Markets always have a manipulated sense to them and quite frankly I get tired of the claims -- not because I think they ring of conspiracy theory but anytime a big player is the market it could be seen as manipulation -- that is the nature of the beast otherwise we would need to go to some socialist form of everyone at all times having the same available capital to trade -- now with that said you have to ask yourself at what cost are you willing to trade bitcoin niche purity to crossing the chasm to mainstream adoption -- I see this as nothing more as a maturation of capital market, but many in the bitcoin purist camp think we need to intentionally steer away from involving bitcoin in modern finance -- sadly they hold their purists views so close that they would risk falling into a niche industry that simply stays niche -- I willing to bet many of the ciphorpunks that witnessed the birth of the internet and the freedoms it stood for might feel a bit irked that it has become a tool of the largest invasion of individual liberties known to man -- however even with that said it has greatly improved mankind -- so ask yourself the question as to what you feel is important -- to go to PorchFest the rest of time with bitcoin purity in tact or to have it join mainstream day to day operations -- the calls for having Amazon accept bitcoin are laughable with the current market depth -- if you don't allow the capital market to mature there is no telling how long it will remain niche or if it will fall out of taste and simple NOT cross the chasm  -- some thoughts to consider

I have been covering this story for the last 2 days and I still see the same arguments from the Bitcoin idealist -- I am one of those by the way so don't get me wrong -- but in my eyes we are talking about two different worlds here -- we will still be able to play in the current wild west of bitstamp, btc-e, &amp; bitfinex but those exchanges aren't suitable if we want the BILLIONS, let me say it again BILLIONS of institutional money to flow in Bitcoin &amp; the Crypto markets. They are housing their data centers in the same place that other HFTs house their shops -- the HFTs allow Institutions like Hedge funds that chase beta on a quarter to quarter basis to get in and out of massive positions. With that said do NOT think of this exchange for us but look at it as liquidity spillover into the exchanges we DO play in where HFTs can't go. There will be continued trading opportunities in these frontier exchanges along with those that are alt-coin specific

I agree with your assessment of the video -- but it was the only footage of Bill Maher I could find and I also want to hear what left leaning people have to say even if I don't agree with them -- that way I can't be accused of only listening to Peter Schiff talking points etc. The fact that mainstream left like Bill Maher get it along with someone I consider respectable like Glen Greenwald starts to paint Hillary firmly in the Hawk camp -- there is no doubt that a great division is happening and I think Fox's Megan Kelly in her take down of Dick Chaney are starting to see that base erode and how out of touch it was especially the millennials.

@_date: 2014-03-05 21:38:43
Unfortunately you labeled every point with 1. so it makes commenting on the specifics confusing -- but I do think you raise great points -- your first point I think is VERY relevant, I used to stand in line at Chipotle thinking how it even be possible to make that experience or any Brick&amp;Mortar sale for that matter streamlined for Bitcoin transactions -- I came to conclusion that is nowhere near where it would need to be for that kind of adoption to occur but just because I can't tell you what the solution is doesn't mean that the free market won't come up with one in time with all the VC capital flowing into disruptive payments currently. Secondly I just came to the realization that Bitcoin does NOT NEED B&amp;M to succeed -- it blows away payment friction online to such degree that B&amp;M is just a novelty bonus. B&amp;M will always be last to adopt as they also deal with the baby boom generation much more(think employee run check-outs VS self check-outs at your supermarket and you will know what I mean).
to your second point on digital hygiene or security -- another solid point but I think there are some very promising solutions on the cusp.
I found within a week of being introduced to Bitcoin that there is 2 companies to never trust: MtGox and BFL -- not sure what "World's most popular exchange" really means? like the girl in 8th grade that screaming and then crying 1 hour later ? they had fallen to 4th or 5th as far as daily volume near the end and were unseated as number 1 in the middle of last year
Last point -- versus handing all your power over to the government or the big banks? How's that going for you &amp; the rest of the world's citizens? didn't say it was going to be easy

Function is focused on converting merchant processing or consumers BTC to fiat -- trading functions are what you see out of OKCoin -- futures markets, HFT, co-location support etc that are active professional trader friendly
BTC China’s product line truly reflects that it is moving from simply being an exchange to becoming a company, which aims to develop a wealth of products and services for the digital currency industry 
Seems like their vision isn't focused here -- human capital is scarce but they are trying to do too many things -- as a pro trader this turns me off immensely

Cost of tuition IMO -- and the only way to learn is **to** put skin in the game -- you won't learn it in the lecture halls as it isn't as easy as clicking the mouse around, drawing lines on charts and checking your P&amp;L --  ultimately it is this perceived mindset that is the problem not the act of becoming a trader/professional -- being a trader is like managing any other business and has its unique challenges -- it also can be one of the most consuming but rewarding experiences if taken seriously like any good business man would. 
The whole "90% of traders lose money" etc etc can almost be applied to any profession that requires a very precise skill set. Probably 99% of aspiring football players "lose time value of money" practicing for something that gets them nowhere and I can go on and on. Many of the "successful traders" needed to blowout their account 2-3 times before they "knew what they were doing" -- and there **is** no easy way around this besides experiencing it plain and simple. It might seem like a hard pill to swallow blowing through $20-30k to reach that level of understanding but no one seems to blink twice about forking out that for a college degree that is continually giving them less return value if any. 
-- What bothers me most about your post is what you actually acknowledge -- it is overt paternalism thinking people need to be looked over and that you know better, steering them away from such "evils" -- life is full of lessons that must be experienced not **told** by others. That process in and of itself is what drives people to truly discovering **who** they are and their purpose, not listening to all the risk adverse paternalists in the room, if that were the case there would be very little innovation/creation in the world as paternalists are the epitome of mundane

Why bother ? BitStamp has set a pretty clear tone that they have no interest in engaging the trading community they serve so I am quite happy in allowing them to die and fade from relevancy especially when there are plenty of other exchanges in the space that greatly interact (OKCoin, BFX, BitMEX, BTC.sx) -- ultimately it doesn't matter as most of the trading community has spoke long ago and voted with their money as wrote about in a pastebin last summer already

Seems like you are looking for more market moving news that actually effects price or more so to see what effect it has on price ?  -- I guess the question is how real time do you want it or do you just want a hightlight reel once a day. 
The only reason I responded is because we have a 200+ user BTC Trader TeamSpeak channel -- seeing that there can be big money on the line we are always on the pulse of what is going on because we have to be. But you are going to get the noise just the same.

This is so **FUD-like** -- I greatly suspect this is coming out the IRC camp  etc who have no lives and are butt hurt that TS has gotten so big.

I think your sensational title is rather reaching in its accusational manner with out any context so here is the actual transcript of encounter:   -- I have to admit though there is inevitability a leap of faith that **must** happen with anyone that is going to trust their funds with a centralized exchange on really **any** manner that concerns them. In the end as a trader I have to decide what level of trust I am going to give them period if I want to trade at all. Currently Phil Potter and other exchange operators engage the trading community on TS and it might not be enough to your liking but it goes along way to gaining my confidence. So much so that after months passing since I left BFX I will be sending some funds back there to not only diversify some risk but because I am curious to see what their new AlphaPoint roll-out will bring from a performance standpoint -- I am fairly certain I wouldn't have made this decision without Phil's presence on TS and my candid interactions with him.
Now I know the idealist response is we need to just stop using exchanges, sit on our hands and wait for the day of reckoning that decentralized exchanges make the central players all obsolete. But I can tell you from a performance standpoint that is years if not decades away and BTC price is moving **now** -- I am not even sure I will see it in my lifetime. **But** I acknowledge the risk that I am taking in doing this -- it is the wild west of sorts but it has made me feel more alive then the soul sucking work I did for years in the banking sector. All the exchanges are start-ups and you can actively engage them.
Do you have any interest on coming on TS and discussing more ? I hope you can gather from my tone that I am not evoking confrontation but I do hear and acknowledge the points that you are making that warrants more discussion --  TS server: desticraft.fr:9988

If bitcoin is to be antifragile I don't want it handled with care -- throw absolutely everything negative at it and see if stands -- if not it is no better than the fragilista central banking system that needs to be coddled


Really ?

So we should expect the zero fee model to continue then -- based upon how impressed you were with the volume 
@_date: 2015-01-06 23:18:55
The biggest contention with a decentralized exchange is the lack of performance at the matching engine level as well as algo order types and leverage -- I am sure I am going to get the hate barrigade that there is no need for that but it attracts liquidity plain and simple in the maturation process of capital market -- ignoring this **current time period** fact means BTC can only remain niche

@_date: 2014-03-23 21:31:29
He was looking more to have twice daily auctions for institutions mainly because of how thin the the overall BTC markets are from an institutional level. This would make it easier for them to move the volume they are looking to move. This isn't really price "fixing" as the other exchanges will trade around the release of the auctions -- similar to the way the Treasury Markets trade around their note auctions  
@_date: 2015-01-11 14:37:01
In the new age world "help" has been co-opted as a business term but you are simply providing a valuable service that you should be compensated for -- there is no need to blur the lines that you should be compensated for your services -- I am happy that you exist as a business but I wouldn't use the word "help" as the 're-definition of it drives me crazy

he is rather pompous and snarky but he understands the hoodwinking that is going with the payment processors and their X company now "accepts bitcoin" -- this isn't true adoption and although it might be bullish the payment protocol it is bearish the currency as it is an exit of fiat from the system

No idea what point you are tying to make here -- 


This is getting to the at nauseam point of stating that the entire TRS can be construed as a CDS-- swap rates change with market action and as people move from USD to BTC to leverage (see bfx data site previously listed) 


What gives them more validity is that both Huobi and OKCoin with the same type of p2p margin desk have very similar rates so it is par for the course as far BTC margin trading goes

That is an interesting point and remains a resistance trendline-- but that not the only trendline off the ATH -- we had a pretty massive technical break-out from an intersection of an ATH resistance line and support line going back to the Silk Road closure crash -- those charts were off Bitstamp. I think it is little backhanded to see all of was pom-poming $2k prices in a week -- I think &amp; the traders in the Bitcoin Trading view community saw it is a move to a higher trading range.

Yeah if you are US based it is a good fiat gateway in and out. I still don't really see them as a competitive exchange globally as the large majority of BTC volume still remains offshore and they really don't have tools and features that active traders need (margin long/short, leverage, algo order types like icebergs and advanced ones like OCO) . 
Can't imagine mining was a good unitization of time or resources unless you like the hobbyist aspects to it.
Volatility provides trading opportunities as well.

Essentially you are looking at a visualization of the order book depth -- I do believe cryptowatch has updated to include Coinbase exchange API so I would point you there for a better way of visualizing it then on the Coinbase site itself-- during our WhaleClub TeamSpeak hangout with Coinbase I told Roman, Michael and Charlie Lee that it would be better to represent it at the right hand margin and orientate it vertically like the way CW and BW do it. To me that just makes more intuitive sense as a trader.
Just curious are you just getting into bitcoin trading and what made you choose Coinbase over BFX or others ?
Either way welcome aboard if you are starting to trade actively

It is still the best way to do it IMO -- people always want to have their cake and eat it too and that I get that vibe from you. There has only been 1 other time that we saw a 6% socialized loss so you are cherry picking data so I will just outright dismiss that accusation. I guess if you aren't happy with the way they do things there is BitMEX that has no socialized losses and ICBIT as well -- they sound like they are more catering to the hedging crowd from my interactions with them

I have used OKC for a long time and would have more confidence recommending OKC if lag/matching engine issues are nonexistent

I think the current salvage operation of filled margin calls is a great first step to keeping the insurance fund padded.


for those that primary are hedgers sounds like a great option for them


I strongly dislike this option as it might give you a disadvantage to competitors like BitVC in which you would see a migration of your user base to them. And this goes for any earned leverage system as well -- I think the people advocating this don't understand the repercussions in the competitive landscape that OKC finds itself in. Also I think it is very touchy and really would like to see less resources being employed trying to balance this or come up with some complex system and instead focus on dev, improvements.

What do you say to the accusations of frontrunning/latency arbitrage that seem to manifest themselves on the futures exchange at times -- has shown the situation where he market sold 13contracts and dropped the price $13 which I know is fully aware of
also yesterday we brought this to Zane's attention  in which a 4k market sell had a $2.10 gap as bids were yanked on the way down. I have also experienced many times where I try and hit bids and offers often not the exact front of the book of say 100contracts and they get yanked before I my order gets there with no fills of the orders even infront of larger order(in which they could be using that as safety value to cancel the larger order) -- I know this because there is no corresponding time and sales of someone beating me to the order I am trying to hit.

I do like the idea of Bitcoin Volatility product though

You are naive to think those don't go hand in hand though -- unless you want to hold hands in crypto utopia of "not needing to convert BTC to fiat ever again" but that is just a silly idea -- trading and speculators provide a great value as the lubrication of markets and information flow that results in price discovery. Thinking these markets could be birthed in the idealists matter even though they chest thump the day Amazon will be accepting BTC just goes to show their ignorance -- what the risk is then is Bitcoin slips away into a niche industry (can't cross the chasm, Mike Hearn speaks of this often). Specualtive demand is real demand and what is an indisputable use case for BTC is as a new speculative asset class. I am sick of hearing that trading isn't real value etc -- as long as their is a risk taken there is positive value to be discerned which is the essence of a marketplace. 
In the end it isn't about what Bitcoin is "suppose to be about" or what you think it should be -- it is simply what it is used for as we stand here today. 
Side note: Bitcoin traders generally would prefer up but they are fine with down as well as there has been plenty of money to be made shorting the 15 month downtrend

This is the perfect addition to supplement bitcoin for the end individual users — I understand the businesses growing up around bitcoin that have specific interests &amp; how the Foundation wants to play ball with the regulators and get their blessings — let them woo them as they see fit — Dark Wallet is perfect to subvert those efforts with little confrontation between increasingly centralized establishment-embracers &amp; those that value privacy and censorship resistance
Moreover even if you find yourself of more of person for the middle ground -- Dark Wallet provides a vote for those that highly value censorship resistance and privacy -- hopefully when this project gets overwhelming funding the bitcoin community at large will see that there is a dollar amount associated with maintaining these principles and even establishment businesses can take note of that
Lastly I would like to be a bit more optimistic as the both the video and the Dark Wallet website have some negative things to say about the seemingly cozy relationship with some of the Bitcoin Foundation members and the government agencies/officials -- this shouldn't be overlooked but I also feel that Gavin especially is giving the regulators a bit of lip-service to keep them off the backs of bitcoin developers/new businesses -- it may feel like a bit of sell out but once a critical mass is reached the governments abilities to challenge bitcoin will be a desperate last gasp

It is dangerous to make such blanket statements of "superior forever" I agree -- I don't believe you were directing this at me but I feel your frustration to those that tout any entity that way -- it does drive a cult-ish feel that actually turns people off to the cause or wanting to get involved -- I think we both understand the difficulties of dealing with the state -- right now as we sit it has great value form a purely censorship resistance standpoint -- where society will move from this moment is anyone's guess -- I do hope for more of a sharing economy that subverts state establishment -- but I have to be realistic and know that the state will react like a cornered rat -- hissing, biting and taking innocent people with it when its power is threatened -- only time will tell

Other than armory though is it being done behind the scenes ?Not that I know of ? Even Armory has it as an opt-in feature. If we assume that a new user to Bitcoin is going to have the same security hygiene that they have had their whole internet life(which as we know is piss poor) I think the least amount of friction comes from key-stretching versus a 48 character random dice keepass password -- that is simply too high of a barrier currently

I am not sure how I feel about your rant in its entirety -- I can agree with parts of it -- and I don't see this declaration or China in general as some savior -- other than ending the current vicious US debt cycle only to restart another cycle that may very well become just as bad with time -- and your arguments do have some merit as far as "trusting" China -- whether the world really "trusts" the US more in the wake of Edward Snowden/NSA as well what they are doing with QE &amp; political brinkmanship is debatable -- it is just that the US has the tradition of being "trusted" -- a big step to gain world trust would be to at least partially back the Yuan with gold -- that isn't to say they can't change it after they have acquired trust the same way the US dollar was untethered from gold in stages. 
Also why should China seed to the demands from the US to allow their currency to float? and if you don't understand -- this is just a hollow demand by Treasury officials to save political face --know as "talk a strong dollar" --  as it would collapse the ability of the US to buy cheap Chinese goods since their citizens would be able to afford the very products they produce then

I actually would have had Trace Mayer as my second choice to Erik -- I think Trace(although not alone) likes to argue between the difference of Money(the Asset) &gt; Money substitute &gt; Money illusion -- problem is gold backed debit card is still a money substitute -- what happens when governments/third parties get their hands on the contracts that determine the terms of the claim(substitute) on the asset they are holding for you? "Sorry your gold is gone" or "There will be a 30% fee for delivery" -- system hasn't changed then

Lets play this situation out -- an interested party knows that said women goes into motel room to perform an act -- he sits in his truck with a .44 magnum knowing she is coming out with $500-1k of cash after the job is completed -- when she is walking to her car he approaches her and welds the gun demanding the cash -- knowing she can't report it takes the loot with-him -- now with a watch-only bitcoin address once he welds the gun she doesn't even have the ability to transfer payment to him through her mobile device -- this doesn't preclude her from violence at that specific moment nor a very determined crook that would take her hostage and force her to the place where she could access her private keys and send him the funds -- but you have to see how much that raises the stakes for the crook -- his rate of return on investment plummets because it introduces way to many unknown variables &amp; added time into the equation -- my guess is he will pick an easier target -- it isn't a perfect solution but one of risk mitigation

He ultimately misses the point that a 3rd party isn't necessary in a currency unbounded by the advent of internet -- seems stuck on the idea that someone has to manage the money so that is why he says a government backing their currency by gold or Bitcoin would be disastrous but there is no real need for government backing as a 3rd party

My biggest concern is the same with the exchanges we see of current -- there remains tremendous counterparty risk to do anything other then small amounts -- I know there is some contention around Mastercoin especially in implantation but I would like to see an options and derivatives market come out of that project -- it would greatly open up individuals and institutions abilities to harness the current volatility and hedge off risk -- right now it makes little sense because you trade the hedging ability of some these small sites for legal domicile and counterparty risk of the firm

China doesn't have a problem waiting as long as it takes -- they are a humble and patient people -- so although you might be justified in saying they are there at this exact moment China is definitely moving the correct direction from assuming the world reserve currency -- They are set to be the largest nation by GDP before 2020 and they are stockpiling gold -- sentiment is changing link turning a massive oil barge -- America is far more dependent on China -- if the RMB would be allowed to float and appreciate massively Chinese citizens would be able to purchase the products they are exporting so there would be no need to rely on the US plain and simple

I am indeed a member of the foundation -- regardless of your intent I interpreted your qualification as an association between your personal view and your link to LTB -- I can believe that you had no intentions in doing that however that is the perception that was created -- and I point that I am not the only one to make this observation as millybitcoin pointed it out first
I also don't particularly like the bitcoin foundation for the exact reason that Trace Mayer points out:
"TM: I think, I would like to change the ability to participate anonymously. And that’s because when you give people a mask then they’ll tell you the truth. And this will have wide ranging effects in all areas of the Bitcoin ecosystem.
For example, the amount of freedom we get is directly proportional to the degree of protection that we’re able to secure. I think, far too much of what we’re doing with the Foundation is focusing and catering to people that are not our core customers. For example, regulators, law enforcement, or governments. And if we can secure a lot more protection through the use of cryptography, development, etcetera, then we can provide a much better product to our customers.
I think key to that is allowing people to participate anonymously. Perhaps, one of the reasons why we don’t have anonymous participation is so that we can call out and censor the different ideas and the different voices that might actually make Bitcoin more useful, but wouldn’t necessarily be helpful to regulators or law enforcement.

I may reiterate a point or two but I will try and bring a different articulation
1. The millennial generation is pissed at the hand they have been dealt and hate companies that are status quo and make their lives miserable by never changing -- they want them rocking the boat and they want to be on the leading edge -- bitcoin is a fully mobile phone payment system and this is what the gold star generation wants at the very least to have the option of 
2. I am assuming that some of these large retailers would at least consider a pilot program at a few select locations -- this allows them to minimize a large upfront investment and test how the market would respond real-time -- I can tell you right now that the cultish following of bitcoin would be overwhelming in these locations and they may start to get customer feedback from other locations saying they want it implemented -- it would also prepare them to see what they would need to do to scale appropriately 
3. Think internationally -- one standard payment system that they don't have to mess with specific local arrangements -- maybe the US is fluid enough for this to be less of a consideration but what about their stores in Argentina for example ? Are they being hassled to death by a crony payment processor charging ridiculous fees -- that might not be the best example but I would bet there are some hostile locations they do have stores in
4. Making a jump off  how about the un-banked African nations ? Finally they have vast swaths of largely untamed territory to finally move into and not consider the shakiness of the financial services infrastructure of those nations -- granted internet access is of a concern but the M-pesa mobile payment network in Kenya represents 30% of Kenya's GDP so there is definitely promise going forward
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:00:52
I would point you to two of Nassim Taleb's books -- Antifragile and The Black Swan -- the personal finance approach looks at convexity (that which benefits from volatility) -- allocating resources at the far ends of the risk spectrum(barbelled) rather than a middle of the road approach of mediocristan -- a standard 401k retirement plan essentially steers the sheep into assets that the broker can wash their hands of legal liability under their suitability of risk metric -- unfortunately this sows the seeds for black swan events and happens to be where Joe Average has the girth of his retirement funds allocated

Key stretching question --- If you have an encrypted wallet that uses key-stretching like in Armory does this offer more entropy &amp; hence GPU brute force resistance ?

Where your naive logic breaks down is the concept that the state needs to "cease to exist" or that I am arguing for that conclusion that you quickly jump to -- instead I subscribe to what HAS and continues to be the trend of technological developments that peacefully subvert the inefficient State apparatus and route around the damage done by government meddling -- it is concept of political change defined as "exit" rather than "voice" -- the establishment media (FOX, NBC) would not be influenced by "voice" from within that millennials will NOT sit in front of the TV for the 6oclock news -- instead through technology like social media millennials peacefully "exited" and routed around the establishment -- here is a solid video to articulate this concept:

I really can't say how valuable this insight is riplin -- one of the biggest issues if safety is a real issue is that after the encounter the woman would be carrying a large amount of cash that could open her up to being a target to whom violence could be threatened against her -- with a watch-only address this makes the ability to extort funds from her very burdensome -- I could also see that if proper encryption was taken on her mobile device if the police were to try to arrest her after the fact again is much more difficult for them to show there was payment between the two parties compared to a large amount of cash in her possession

I will completely admit that I am basing my decision off the debates that are SPECIFICALLY for the board seat -- I haven't heard her speak outside of that debate nor will I look up her college debate team youtube video to try and gauge her abilities because we are here to elect a BOARD member and how they prepare specifically for position-- after hearing her speaking on the debates I was completely turned off to hear anything else she had to say
As to your point I do not have an issue in that she went to great links to prepare -- but preparation should be to a general outline response to the question -- not a word for word manuscript
I have to base my decision on the conscious choice she made to prepare and deliver in that manner -- again the approach makes my skin crawl and I have to challenge the rest of her credibility because of it

Couple of thoughts on the article: 
"In a number of cases, the use of bitcoin has made it harder for police to track financial transactions or seize criminal profits, law-enforcement officials said."
-- unfortunately when police "seize criminal profits" that means they seize everything leaving little financial ability and long court proceedings to absolve oneself
"Law enforcement has had some successes tracking Bitcoin crime. For instance, it can be easy for law enforcement to track down inexperienced Bitcoin users, said Scott Dueweke, a senior associate at Booz Allen Hamilton who has advised U.S. agencies, including the DEA, on virtual currencies."
-- Booz Allen happens to be the firm that Snowden worked for which is an NSA contractor -- I am sure through enough NSA backdoors and warrantless hovering up of data they can piece together a user identity of bitcoin

It is something that resonates in people's mind though-- a jingle of sorts -- you have to tether memory to prior memory to build association -- it might not be the ideal association but it is much like trying to explain to someone the first time you introduce bitcoin as a digital gold or digital cash -- both are shortfalls on the part of the explainer but you need to build it out from somewhere as a tether point

Well Peter said on his show that "we reached out to the bitcoin community" -- which I can tell meant his producers/interns -- but then he goes on to say "we got in these chat rooms and asked them(bitcoiners) to call into the show" -- so clearly Peter is living in the 90s because this is forum not a chat room -- goes to show his tech-unsavviness

The curious case of explaining bitcoin is quite the endeavor -- it helps to know some of the leanings of the person or persons you are speaking with -- sometimes I try and articulate it purely on a payment systems approach devoid of any political leanings -- other times I like to take the approach of "voice" vs "exit" -- I see so much on facebook these days from my friends who are anti-Wall Street, against the big banks, and want me to "call my Congressman to make XXX a crime" blah blah blah -- it might sound like a nice war call but why not just peacefully opt out of their corrupt system -- bitcoin provides this -- and as other have articulated on here -- in time the bitcoin economy will function along side and independent of that based on the fiat money of the nation-state -- eventually there will be a tipping point where many citizens simply choose not to engage the nation state and they will be marginalized as they should be -- this isn't to say they won't go out with a fight -- like a cornered rat hissing, snarling, biting and taking some innocent people with it

I don't think I was articulating that their WHOLE business be predicated on the internet -- just that they offer it as a supplement to their existing brick&amp; mortar -- there were plenty of businesses that were left behind or scoffed at the internet and regretted it years later because a laughable competitor at the time became a crushing foe later -- the internet business model was not the entire reason for the tech bubble -- an intelligent discussion must include Fed interest rate policy during this period as well to explain some of the excesses of that period -- either way the risk that is taken by entrepreneurs in the space provides a tremendous amount of creative destruction -- the individual businesses may be fragile but the system benefits from this and becomes anti-fragile in nature

Caller's name was Forrest -- if you are out there you did a hell of a job in the short time you got -- It is very telling when Peter responded to you : "What can you do with bitcoin that you can't do with some other digital currency that someone can come up with " 
He clearly doesn't understand that there is zero-trust in a counterparty needed for the bitcoin network to function

Yeah it didn't help that Peter was clearly still worked up from his guest when they brought you on air -- but just confirmed my suspicions -- he doesn't get the technological breakthrough a decentralized ledger that requires zero trust in the counterparty -- Peter is understanding though that UI can be built on complex systems -- so I think once he starts to understand the blockchain he will see the potential -- I think a good way to illustrate the point to Peter is go over why his gold backed debit card is so dangerous -- the custodian of the gold itself as well as the domicile it resides in must be trusted -- we know these contracts can be broken as time goes on to include out right fraud -- eventually over time the rules change and we don't even know if the supposed gold we have with the custodian is actually still there

Being a derivatives trader myself I found this article at The Genesis block(  ) very well done in theory although as discussed the liquidity and development of the bitcoin derivatives market still has to have ample liquidity to provide the ability to hedge effectively
Especially a difficulty futures mechanism could be implemented by large mining pools to ensure that there still is incentive for them to mine even when there is either volatility in difficulty or the bitcoin price as well. I do think that Andreas made a good point in Episode 28 as to an event where say 10% of the hashing power suddenly evaporates but an evolving derivatives market could do a lot to bring much needed supply into the bitcoin market in these shock scenarios

You are beginning to get entrenched in your ideologue of trying to justify what you believe is progressive without examining the unintended consequences of implementation -- capital will move where it is welcomed most and in the digital age tax domicile is a function of having the  capital means to position properly -- some of it being good tax law counsel  -- or by simply having your wealth outside of the reach US jurisdiction -- inherently the burden then falls disproportionately on the middle/working class -- the obedient plebs without the means to evade &amp; enough of backbone to be proud to work and not accept welfare/food stamps

--Obviously it it depends on your suitability to risk and what is considered large to you -- I can tell you that I keep a minimum amount in there namely because a web wallet function does not allow you to have direct and exclusive control of your private keys
What I have learned from introducing bitcoin to my friends is that a learning curve ensues as they begin to understand that they are going to want to take possession of their keys themselves -- it is really just a good digital hygiene practice IMO -- why put yourself in the position to have to deal with Coinbase problems if they so arise ?

Keys to success: articulate between bitcoin as a currency unit and the bitcoin payment network to draw the true concept of value that it creates --bring up Peter's EuroPac bank gold-backed debit card -- touch on liability/counterparty. Is EuroPAC bank the custodian of that gold backing or is there a third party involved? Perth Mint maybe? In addition that chain of custody is exposed to the specific government domicile they reside in (so whether it is explicit changes to that domicile's tax/reg code or civil war, natural disaster etc), lastly I would ask if the debit card is run on the Visa, MasterCard networks and subject to their fee structure and additional fees as well as I am sure you CAN initiate a charge back with it

yeah Tom Woods is trying to break into the scene by coat-tailing off The Peter Schiff Show and his audience -- Tom on occasion sits in for Peter when he is absence -- I have been a long time listener to Peter Schiff who has yet to come around to bitcoin --  he still clings to gold but these things take time as we know
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:57:05
You reflect my points exactly -- and I would add Peter Schiff to that list -- I have listened to his radio show for over 2 years -- I can still tell he doesn't understand the counter-party risk when he makes strong promotions of his gold backed debit card and how it is "backed by something" -- the last real allegiance I had to gold was that as the vanguard against despotic government by being something not subject to the whims of governments and politicians-- even though I knew it was clunky and inconvenient to mine, store, transfer I thought it was a necessary evil to maintain the people's purchasing power over time against an unchecked government -- but with bitcoin I have really fallen out of favor with gold -- it really has become a barbaric relic lol -- I think even if you look through history the goldbugs that yearn for the salvation back to the gold standard as their vindication will be sorely disappointed because (barring an Alien EMP) once society has a digital option we don't go back EVER

Spot on! I have been hitting this point home on numerous posts regarding Peter -- the counterparty risk in the analog world of gold to make the jump to digital is its death knell -- Peter has tried to say "Well what if China makes a crypto and backs it with gold in its vault" -- he not only doesn't understand the counter party in a hierarchical system -- but why would a population choose to go back to central counterparty if bitcoin (at least up to now) provides the problem can be solved through a distributed network -- Peters mind hasn't made the jump from analog to digital and being a long time listener and follower of Peter I am losing interest in him quickly solely in his obtuse view on this matter

 I will come to your defense on this -- I am in the exact same boat with you (I believe)-- I have no doubt that we both want to see bitcoin succeed very much -- and many of the censorship-resistant features inherient to bitcoin are liberty's best stand against the state -- it is just going to be a very difficult road as the state &amp; their dollar hegemony will not go quietly -- like a cornered rat they will hiss, bite, and take innocent people with it -- my biggest concern is that there is enough critical mass (especially with the Senate hearing coming this month) to fend off a big blow by the state at this juncture as I agree that Joe Blow is no help against government/media spin as they are too involved in rearranging their fantasy football team after Aaron Rodgers went down -- what is and will CONTINUE to be important going forward is not only venture capital &amp; legitimate businesses uses of bitcoin to continue to gain momentum but also charity organizations (which I think bitcoin is doing well now but should continue even more) -- the State/politicians/MSM aren't going to go swinging their sledgehammer at bitcoin if we hold up such organizations like Sean's Outpost to swing at as it would be political suicide for them -- I also know people are going to hate me for saying this but I think showing that bitcoin reduces friction in process for campaign donations is something even politicians can wrap their mitts around
@_date: 2013-10-26 03:38:27
I understand your general attitude toward it -- but this bill is gathering steam and it brings more and more awareness with it -- very few of the mainstream public have any idea what the Federal Reserve even is much less what "we libertarians" know as its twisted inner workings -- so grabbing headlines does help to shift popular sentiment -- and just replace your train of thought with "NSA spying" -- I am sure you and I KNEW the NSA was spying on all its own citizens and heads of 35 ally countries -- for some reason it does change the general attitude toward the ultimate function and purpose of that entity even if they "keep on keeping on"
Some people find their way to Bitcoin by starting to question the Federal Reserve and "what is money" -- even if this bill ends up all theater think of some people googling the Federal Reserve prompted by someone like Fox's Jon Stossel and finding their way into cryptocurrencies
@_date: 2013-11-11 23:13:31
I think the "what if bitcoin is simply banned ?" is a dead issue in the short term at least -- mainly because the Federal Election Commission(FEC) has issued a draft which looks likely to pass to allows bitcoin donations to political campaigns -- also note that it is was the Conservative Action Fund(SuperPAC) that prompted the guidance -- once the politicians have a taste of bitcoin donations they wouldn't dare "ban" it

The IMF bail-in model is the standard procedure for bank failures(yes in the US as well) to curb contagion when it comes to unstable politicians picking who gets a a bailout or not -- so from the IMF's perspective it holds less systemic risk to follow a bail-in model -- the American Public are asleep to this standard and will get a rude awakening when there isn't a bailout but a bail-in with heavy capital controls 
@_date: 2013-11-07 01:21:02
There is much to be argued about the current disdain within society on socioeconomic caste grounds -- there is a clear breakdown in civic responsibility at the community level but I believe that is largely because there is a warped sense of distinction of private properly which breeds the entitlement of "you HAVE to help me &amp; my fifteen kids" --so working class citizens aren't incentivized to help and be involved because they feel the nanny state will take care of it since the 30+% income tax fleecing was enough for "their fair share" to society-- trying to attack the loopholes whether it is for wealthy private individuals or corporations doesn't realign incentives and capital will move elsewhere -- namely overseas

@_date: 2013-11-09 13:51:10
This is really typical market behavior of a new, revolutionary technology -- there is no central bank providing additional liquidity or restraining supply so what we have is pure market forces -- if you are expecting a fixed linear rate of return for stability stake you are in the wrong instrument -- price action will be in fits and spasms in a non-linear fashion -- some may say logarithmic which has merits but what is more likely is extremely volatile periods then sideways consolidation -- volatility is good as the price discovery process continues -- I would also add that many more people take a serious look at bitcoin when it goes on these significant runs -- does that mean some weak handed sheep get in ? Sure -- but so do people that end up pushing adoption further -- have to take the good with the bad

"Reaping the benefits" is debatable and is inherently subjective -- taxation through coercion does not allow voluntarily expression of financial speech of a minority position -- regardless of the free rider argument  if said government programs are so efficient and provide such a net benefit to society at large then there should be no debate as to why people would voluntarily contribute even without 100% participation

Capital flight is a trend in said environment -- it is simply about incentives so don't engage me in some nit-pick examples -- someone may stay yes but you have to see that it would mean less opportunity for those that are here -- not to mention an even larger collapse in tax base -- we are on Bitcoin subreddit after all so these things such as tax domicile are becoming more and more of a reality for those outside of the ultra rich -- it took manufacturing roughly 15-20 years to make the full transition to a more friendly place to operate -- and that very large physical facilities, with supply chains, and a large worker base -- in the digital age with companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook etc how easy would it be from them to fly off into the cloud -- that move is exponentially easier than the manufacturing migration we witnessed before

Actually I disagree to a certain extent -- 2.0 may very well go down only to be followed by 3.0 a week later and then once 3.0 goes down 4.0 will be up the next day and so on --  the vibe I get is Sen. Carper is seeing how futile this battle is-- and the fact that 2.0 is up-and-running just reassures him of any doubts he may had that other drug fear-mongering congressman(Sen Schumer) were making that it could be "stopped" -- so he is politely asking that the whole tactic of intervention needs to be re-evaluated -- he leaves the guidance vague but is very much so questioning the current methods

There are more and more direct trade agreements getting forged that bypass the US dollar hegemony -- the announcements generally draw little more than a mention by media but what I see developing is a death by a thousand paper cuts for US dollar as Reserve Currency status -- throw in NSA spying hurting US tech companies internationally as reflected in recent earnings reports, China hoarding gold and upping their rhetoric of de-americanizing the world, Saudi Arabia livid over non-US engagement in Syria -- all these are little bites out of the dollars edge -- at some point the changes will begin to accelerate

I will offer what a couple of factors I believe are in play:
Remember bitcoin only has a "market cap" of $2 billion -- many of these big companies generate over a billion a day in revenue -- with that being said it hard for them to want to engage with something that is smaller than their daily revenue from a currency perspective -- I actually give some respect to these big companies that they understand that the infrastructure in the bitcoin ecosystem is not prepared to handle their massive revenue volume -- this could be good as adoption and infrastructure grow to support this girth in transaction volume
I also think that they are holding back from a regulatory standpoint -- especially the US based companies that are part of the establishment -- they know the iron fist of the US government and regulatory body is brutal and they are allowing the smaller companies to test the water for them

||You are spot on -- if I may I want to articulate a few of my opinions on the matter weighing in as a financial options trader -- The Fed likes to "talk taper" but not deliver and you are completely correct that they fear the fallout of the market's reaction to the actual action of tapering -- The Fed has tried to prepare the market for some time of trying to pull it off life support and has tried in the past with the end of QE1 &amp; QE2 but each time the patient/market was unable to stand on its own
|| The Fed is feeling a lot of heat to taper now with the "better than expected" economic data rolling in and general sentiment that is time for them to let the market act like a market again -- so the even harder position now is that of Fed credibility on not tapering -- what I believe they are going to try is a small taper but a reduction on the interest rate 0.255 of reserves held at the Fed -- currently there sits over $2trillion of bank reserves at the Fed earning 0.25% -- this will be an interesting move as it is a potential powder keg on the metric of dollar velocity -- it will be interesting to see it play out and have included a few articles that may interest you

I largely agreed with all you said but as I have done a great deal of research on this matter I will add my 2 cents worth of detail -- the "bail-in" language is coming down from the IMF which is over all the major central banks -- for them they see the bail-in and capital controls as a more orderly scenario then a bailout from the dice roll of basket case politicians of the individual countries -- it just creates much larger systemic risk -- many people I tell about this give me a "well I don't have $100k or $200k in my bank account so I don't care" -- what they miss is first how devastating capital controls can be and also I could see IRA, pensions, and 401k plans being raided and replaced with "defunct bank shares" -- I often laugh when I debate people and they pound the table on no more bail-outs -- they will likely get their wish but it is going to be a rude awakening

no problem -- ultimately I am allowing you to lead this -- as I really like your idea of un-tips and the rethinking of content monetization -- I guess my un-tip could go to you if you bring on someone of opposite view? like Trace? -- this is the beauty of bitcoin-- after all our arguing we exchange bitcoin as a symbol of smoking a peace-pipe and both feel that we have mutual benefit in this whole ordeal

I agree -- I wanted to take the angle of security concerns -- I went through the driver application process -- although I had a shitty car which ended up DQ-ing me they were very focused on driver and rider security -- and I do understand how they pair with an existing facebook account and your CC information to get an idea of who you are and build a sense of trust so the drivers can feel a little less at risk -- but they seem to be turning a blind eye in regards to rider financial security seeing that this is a mobile app on smartphones and you are entering that information and storing it with them on their servers-- I think they could show their security savviness by bringing in bitcoin for these purposes as tech-savvy people are becoming much more security conscious these days if they haven't been in the past
I also curious as to how many people argue chargebacks when they forget to pay and it is auto-debited 24 hours later -- I understand the riders agree to this beforehand but it isn't good business when someone forgots and gets charged the suggested donation only to find these NSF and incur more charges -- it just attaches the stigma of those additional NSF charges to the Lyft service

I welcome your post and I am glad you are trying to set yourself a part from the garbage bin of the likes of Business Insider -- understanding bitcoin is a PROCESS -- I don't mind skepticism but what really burns me is outright dismissal when I can tell the naive state of the writer -- it is perfectly OK to suggest that you as the writer are still going through the process of figuring it out and weighting the risks/reward and utility of this new technology -- that shows a lot of maturity in my opinion

Agreed -- Peter was the one doing the sensationalizing -- he now jumps so quickly to tulip bulbs, ponzi scheme.. wait pyramid scheme(lol) that he really sounds like he completely lost his marbles and is grasping -- I am glad Ed&amp;Ethan pointed this out -- Peter has to know that to stay credible he needs to maintain a solidly based challenge to bitcoin in which I could honestly respect him -- he now sounds like a CNBC pundit cheerleader that just bashes everything they don't understand -- having been a long time listener I have begun to sour on Peter because he is getting so nasty on this one

If you can get him back on his heels with the counterparty risk then you can go after the importance of censorship resistant technology and how it can now apply to money -- I would draw comparisons with bit-torrent(which I am sure Peter has no clue about) and distributed systems versus hierarchical ones

Even Gavin said long ago that bitcoin would go through a series of 3-4 bubbles -- I simply say that bitcoin will advance in fits and spasms with longer periods of consolidation -- that's what a young, healthy and maturing market DOES -- it is important to note that volatility IS healthy as the reach for price discovery/equilibrium is ever ongoing.

The writing has been on the wall for quite some time that China has taking steps to un-tether from the US economically (reducing their treasury holdings, buying real assets with their dollar reserves(gold mines in Africa), direct trade agreements--and now they are finally putting their political rhetoric in a public manner --  the final straw will be when the dollar weakens significantly as well confidence in both the dollar &amp; the US government -- at that point the Chinese will seize the moment to break the US dollars back as the Reserve currency -- my guess is that will at least partially back the Yuan with gold  -- game over

Erik I really like how you articulate between bitcoin as a currency unit and the bitcoin payment network to draw the true concept of value that it creates -- also enjoyed you bringing up Peter's EuroPac bank gold-backed debit card -- you touched on one liability/counterparty but I think there are several more: Is EuroPAC bank the custodian of that gold backing or is there a third party involved? Perth Mint maybe? In addition that chain of custody is exposed to the specific government domicile they reside in (so whether it is explicit changes to that domicile's tax/reg code or civil war, natural disaster etc), lastly I would ask if the debit card is run on the Visa, MasterCard networks and subject to their fee structure and additional fees as well as I am sure you CAN initiate a charge back with it -- thanks again Erik

I have to agree with this post wholeheartedly -- having been an options and derivatives trader for 5+ years the mistake is to think that TA is this "one all" for trading the markets -- what needs to be understood is that it is simply a tool to give some perspective on price action not an absolute of occurrence of future price movements -- when combined with other indicators and TA (ie support &amp; resistance, market depth) a trader can get a sense as to a low risk high probability set-up -- nothing more or nothing less

That is a really good point to bring up about the public ledger -- a caller on Peter's show very near the end tried to bring the public ledger concept  but Peter just talked over it -- he didn't even acknowledge it as a concept -- Peter also loves to say that gold can live in the digital realm with his gold back debit card or gold-money -- problem is specifically counterparty risk end of story

I think the author needs to rethink the idea of "portable" at least how it applies to our modern world -- maybe in the 1500-1800s when all transactions happened locally speaking you could say that gold was "portable" but even the "bank note" had a purpose because people got tired of hauling around their gold from place to place --  I would argue that gold is EXTREMELY NOT portable in relation to modern standards -- bitcoin has a massive advantage in portablity and storablity

also you didn't need to mention that you were the lead of LTB and then make your opinion known under that context -- that creates association between the position of lead at LTB and your personal opinion -- I think that is somewhat of a bothersome approach if you want maintain an objective stance with your reporting -- what if I say I may or may not work for FBI then make personal opinion statements right after -- conclusions do get drawn out of those statements for better or worse

Although governments are purportedly "pondering" this idea of bank bail-in it is already the standard -- these are measures coming down from the IMF that reside over all the major Central Banks -- it actually makes sense from their position -- what they are looking to avoid is the basket case of politicians and statesmen picking what banks fail or get a gov. bailout -- this is highly destabilizing at a systemic global finance level -- the bail-in actually reduces the systemic risk to some point with capital controls and confiscation --I kind of laugh when people protest for "no more bailouts" -- they are in for a rude awakening of what they are going to get instead -- it will be HUGE for bitcoin

Elizabeth T. Ploshay answers really put me off as well -- it was painful to listen to the plastic like responses as if she just finished "Campaigning 101" class and was reading the playbook line for line. In addition she stated the over obvious that she was the only woman running for the board seat -- as if we didn't know that and would use that as a basis for our decision -- she isn't even good looking enough that she would have any charming influence in my opinion -- and I also echo the view that she will buckle under pressure without her notes in front of her -- I do like andrea castillo as the strongest woman presence currently in the bitcoin community -- however she isn't running for the board seat
I do like Trace Mayer's arguments -- I have listened to all his RuntoGold podcasts and he makes a strong argument on conceptually understanding a states ROI for violence-- whether that be physical or through taxation/inflation

I am a bit biased but think I Mastercoin has the most promise -- clearly we are still in the theoretical and have yet to see things fully play out with implimentation -- I welcome the other competitors and they do have more flexibility with their dedicated blockchains to develop -- however for me the big thing is the established bitcoin network that Mastercoin is building upon -- it allows the devs to focus specifically on the implementation and not needing to first re-invent the wheel by having a secure blockchain to build upon -- with the correct UI implementation and development Mastercoin could become very seemless on the already most trusted network

Clearly you are a "recent addition" to the Bitcoin community -- welcome -- however you are quite ill-informed on the concept of volatility in context -- "more volatile than ever" ? Just last April(MtGox)price went from $266 to $48 in less than 12 hours -- that is about an 82% drop by my rough Math -- versus recently it went from $1244 to $455 in the span of about 2 weeks or about a 63% drop -- clearly LESS volatile now -- but this a common misconception because Joe Public is used to looking at stock charts on Google Finance which ONLY represents the PUBLIC life of that company -- what has to be considered is what did the pricing of these companies look like pre-IPO and I think that puts a better context on things -- Here is a nice video on S-curve adoption if you haven't seen it

Fair enough -- I am just pointing out the link that was created in my mind on the mentioning of your position -- again I can step back and say that I don't believe you intended for that to be the case however that is how I (&amp;and at least 1 other) internally felt. There is no way I can "unfeel" that association and I am sure there are plenty of cases where this is in fact the realization. Your statment " My personal sense of ethics means that I keep personal to personal, and public to public." -- I have listened to ALL of your LTB podcasts and read ALL of your articles after the relaunch and anticipate with great excitement the podcasts every week -- but you have to admit MANY organizations do no keep theses personal and public interests separated -- and I think my skepticism is justified in vetting you on these circumstances as I do NOT know your benevolence well enough to trust that you do in fact have them separated

I like to frame it to business owners that on-boarding Bitcoin at this stage is the equivalent of taking the first step toward internet marketing and commerce in 1994 -- businesses that resisted using the internet to further their businesses were completely left behind -- it is so easy to start accepting Bitcoin and show that a business is in touch with a generation that is orders of magnitude more tech savvy -- just look how much time they/we stare at their phones -- the trend clearly is they/we will be paying via their mobile device more and more
