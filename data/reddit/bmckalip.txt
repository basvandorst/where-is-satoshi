people putting on the event are not concerned with advertising bitcoin, rather with advertising their event so they can make more money. This isn't a bad thing, but rather just serves to explain the reason for it being " £5k in Bitcoin"
EDIT: I'm sorry for presenting the facts, I forgot that people, here dislike hearing about reality. I'l keep my facts in instead.

I was a big supporter of Ron Paul and he's my role model/hero. It sounds like you follow suit to his policies. I'm not a Virginian, but you have my support regardless. Best of luck!

The point of talking about the current pric of any investment is to try to predict the future price.... What are you talking about?

because people view the dollar as more of a real currency atm than they see bitcoin. This is the real reason.

I've long believed this will be cryptocurrencies' major flaw and barrier to entry of being a real currency instead of an investment opportunity. To address the problem, lets look at normal fiat currencies like the USD. How is the dollar acquired? Predominately Through jobs. In my opinion, until Cryptocurrencies are used as a form of compensation for work done, they will not catch on as much as they need to in order to gain widespread adoption.

10% for a 1 minute transaction time? seems comparable to bitcoin... when's the last time your transaction confirmed in a minute?

I just bought the dip (albeit much less volume) and I don't care what the price does now, because I am treating this "investment" as if it were a casino, as if any money I put in should be considered gone once spent. With how volatile bitcoin is at the moment, If my small investment drops to zero, I won't lose sleep over it. I'm just out my $80 I spent on 0.1 bitcoins today. meh. I know this doesn't really apply directly to you, but I think it's a good mindset to have when spending money on volatile things.

started their setup process and they need me to do a wire transfer from my bank account, do you know of any modern exchanges that don't require this? preferably credit card, or instant bank transfer (but preferably not)
@_date: 2017-01-11 19:30:21
so you wouldn't recommend an exchange at all, rather p2p local exchange? And yeah, I wouldn't want to use a mobile wallet for storage, are all the bitcoin desktop wallets roughly equal, or is there one you suggest?

thanks for the arrows I wouldn't have known what to look at otherwise

These are not "objective values". These are *subjective* values that you are assigning to gold in this situation. Objects do not have objective value because if people did not exist, gold would not have any value, because there would be no one *to value* gold.
