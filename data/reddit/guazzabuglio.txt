I can vouch for it. I've won 4 or 5 bets and they've all paid out. I just wish it was more active. I've hosted a few bets where no one wagered, so they got thrown out.

I've used [betmoose.com]( before and can vouch for its legitimacy. There's not a ton of high volume going on, but you can bet on pretty much anything from sports to politics to the outcome of award shows. I basically bet beer money there for fun.

I'd like it more if the left side had a QR code.

Nah, I wish. Central Jersey.

Might not be what you're looking for, but there's probably some kind of segwit2x related bets on [BetMoose.](

I guess so. I'm trying to find the easiest way for both my employees and customers. Something that resembles a POS system on the employee's end would be nice. Easy to receive, but impossible to spend, or would require a manager code first (so they could issue refunds if need be). 
I was looking into coinify since it can accept all kinds of crypto and has a decent interface, but I can't find many reviews of it. I was also looking into jaxx, but I've heard they have unfixed security issues.

Fuck that. I'm getting myself a yacht. The S.S. HODL
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:42:17
I'll take that bet

Fold? Probably not. But exchanges not releasing funds for whatever reason is pretty common. It's worth the tiny bit of fees that you pay to maintain control.

At this rate, I'm lucky if I can afford a canoe

You don't really control them if you leave them on an exchange.

Any wallets out there that allow you to setup permissions? I have a shop that takes Bitcoin (through bitpay :/). I'd jump ship in a minute if I could find a wallet/ service that would only allow my employees to accept Bitcoin, without being able to send them (or maybe send them with a password.

What kind of business do you run where you can subsist entirely on Bitcoin? I run an ice cream shop and we've accepted Bitcoin for about a year and a half now. In that time, maybe one person has paid in Bitcoin.

My business (ice cream shop) accepts Bitcoin. I think maybe one person has paid with BTC in the year and a half that we've accepted it. :/
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:22:35
Wouldn't that then require the customer to enter the correct payment on their end?
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:48:44
If an exchange goes belly up or exit scams, your Bitcoin are gone. See what happened to Mt. Gox. It's the difference between having cash in your wallet and letting someone hold your money for you.

I have the Bitcoin Paranoid Android app. I get a notification when the price moves 10% in either direction. No more fomo
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:06:56
You set the price you want to work off of, or it'll set its own checkpoint whenever it reaches 10% (also you can change the interval. It doesn't have to be 10%).

Rufus helped me pick a great Shiraz for my last dinner party.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:00:04
Never used that one before, but I'm going to give it a shot since it also does alts. Thanks.
Edit: damn, looks like it only has 3 or so alts.
Edit: never mind. I'm dumb

What's wrong with bet moose?
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:48:39
[Betmoose.com]( is strictly Bitcoin betting. They have some sports bets, but it's really betting on just about anything.
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:17:38
Some of the bets are hilarious. I can attest to its legitimacy too. I've won a couple of bets and was able to pay out. I just wish it had a larger user base.
