Thanks. Appreciate it mate. 
It was a noob question something like if I invested 600USD and got 0.077 BTC, and at the moment BTC is 8000USD, what profit would I get if BTC went to 10000USD (just an example) 
For everyone else, this is a simple and dumb question, but a lot of people are jumping on the Cryptocurreny hype right now, me being one of them lol and I'm just trying to learn the basics.

Question, if I was to buy 0.77 BTC now for 635USD, how much profit would I make if the Bitcoin price went to 10000USD from 8248USD?

Wow, first message I post here and all I get is "simple this, simple that, do the maths, don't invest" blah blah blah.
I think people need to realise they were once at that stage asking dumb and irrelevant questions.
Well done to you for being a pro in this cryptocurrency and trading world but no need to be an ass about it.
I have not invested a single penny and I am not planning to do so for a while.
Stop assuming.

Who said anything about me investing? What if this is me learning by asking questions?
You have to start from somewhere right? You cant just go balls deep and put some money in I understand that! 
It may be a noob question for me and others, but I'm sure when you got in to trading you had questions like that?
