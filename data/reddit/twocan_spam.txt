my fee to move my bitcoin is 50$! I have been accumulating at around 50$ at a time so a psychological barrier has appeared!

Too many digits. Digits of a standard unit should apply to common things like bread and gasoline. 1 is a typical standard. Right now the 1 is Bitcoin which people have to give like 400 loaves of bread for lol

These are the most important for mainstream adoption right?

Yes, it is psychological and utility. Think about where people lose interest (step 2) ...when they say "ok so I have to give like 500 quesadillas for one bitcoin wait a minute I can get like 5$ for 1 quesadilla these days, dude I want a quesadilla". Even tho 1 and 10000000000000 can potentially mean the "same thing", one is way "bigger"

Soon anyone talking about btc will be talking about charging one milly or getting paid 10 satoshi... people still talk about Bitcoin, I think that unit-term is moving out of all practicality in language.

I think that's a good idea, though the 'accessible'  standard amount would change every year or so at this rate

Like if the standard of money USD was "$1 million"  I would be making $.000002 per hour.. or if counting to ten was done not using fingers but by using hairs, 10 would be paltry. People are used to seeing 1 or more of something
