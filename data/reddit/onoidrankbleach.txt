Looks like so far there's been only a slight selloff in reaction to the news. Do you think we'll see a major correction in the coming weeks?

I think you may have the concept of wealth mixed up with its figurative representations. Gold, fiat currency and bitcoins are all accepted to different degrees as convenient stand-ins for real productive assets or claims to their outputs. While bitcoin may become widely accepted around the globe in financial transactions this does not mean that wealth will become automatically redistributed to those who interact in the bitcoin economy. Think about it in terms of other units of exchange: would the overall level of global prosperity be greater or more egalitarian if everyone in the world was magically given 10kilos of gold?

Branson is a good authority on rocket ship rides that crash and burn.

You presume a lot of financial knowledge for someone unfamiliar with what currency is used in China.

This would be an incredibly risky idea. I assume (perhaps incorrectly) that you're proposing that people will pay for this scrip with the local fiat currency. If this is the case then you are in essence issuing an option to buy bitcoin later at the  current days price and are also giving no expiration on that option. 
Some napkin math: Say you were to issue these notes at a fiat price of 100 EUR each and backed by .5 BTC. As a buyer, I can buy these notes and just sit on them. If the price of bitcoin goes up  then I can redeem my notes for your bitcoin and have made a perhaps substantial profit. If the price of bitcoin goes down then I can just spend the notes at your shops (unless your shops are at this point using BTC as their unit of account) or trade it to some other person in exchange for the fiat face value. There is little risk and decent potential reward for me as the buyer and that indicates that you, as the seller, are exposing yourself to a lot of potential pain if I can exploit this successfully. 
I guess alternatively you can have the value of the note itself float based on the current value of BTC, but at that point you've basically issued your own weird local altcoin (remember AuroraCoin?) and I would have a hard time justifying its use over vanilla BTC. 
In order to get this idea off the ground you will also need credibility: buyers will need to trust that the promise for redeemability in bitcoin is ironclad and this kind of trust can be hard to obtain.
