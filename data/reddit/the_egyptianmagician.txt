Don't like rap music = racist. 
Please go back to sniffing glue or whatever it is you do with your time.

I heard it's going to happen soon. They just need to upgrade their trading engine first.

one day, when the fiat price of one bitcoin is $100,000 USD, you will look back at this post and ask yourself, "what was i thinking??" That day will come sooner than many even here believe...

Given the slowness of the markets for several weeks now, it's actually pretty incredible that we have almost 1,000 active users here.

if i was a guest at that wedding i would have been rolling on the floor laughing. it's one step away from tucking a $5 bill under each guest's dinner plate :)

That time of the year? Basically, aside from several flash crashes early on, this has been *all year*.

bitcoin is still in a "stealth" phase. Since everyone is so fond of comparing it to the Internet itself, we're essentially in the ARPANET stage right now, early 1970s. You need to have specialized knowledge (to a degree) and the right attitude to get involved. 
This is a new form of money we're talking about, not signing up for What'sAPP or bullshit like that. Huge things are happening and will continue to happen, and the peaks and valleys we experience today will look like tiny ant hills on the logarithmic charts of the coming years. You haven't seen anything yet.

I'm more mindful of saving and investing in general, but I also will splurge here and there, because anyone who understands how bitcoin works and how revolutionary it is knows that the price is destined to be magnitudes higher in coming years and we will all be rich for cutting through the "ponzi" fud and keeping the faith.
@_date: 2014-07-25 18:45:37
Exactly. The fact that we're being downvoted shows how much this place has devolved over the past year.
@_date: 2014-07-10 01:22:49
what happens if you decide to cash out through coinbase? aren't they (or really, the government) just going to put everyone through a rectal exam later instead of now?

I wasn't aware there were even any libertarians around here anymore. In the current environment where people like Russell Brand and Roseanne Barr are some of the biggest promoters, it's pretty clear that the largest growth is from the "Occupy Wall Street", pro-big government, anti-bank liberal crowd, which I think puts off ordinary, reasonable people much more than any type of libertarian ideology.
@_date: 2014-07-17 21:36:34
What a joke. You could have embraced change, but instead, draconian banking regulations like this proposal will ensure that all the bitcoin startups will go elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-07-11 18:52:13
I agree with the exception of real estate. People spend far too much money on status objects like cars, which depreciate in value. At least with a house, you have something to pass onto your heirs.

If you follow then you'd see their names come up occasionally in articles. Like it or not, along with well known libs such as Ashton Kutcher, those two are some of the highest profile celebrity names backing bitcoin's success. Why do liberals like bitcoin so much? I'm not sure, but I think it's because they think it's a strike against the banks. Of course, what they don't realize is that their beloved government and their darling Barrack Obama controls the biggest bank of them all, and is ultimately responsible for the monetary policies in this country.

So what you're saying is you don't understand the difference between traditional fiat payment processing and bitcoin, so you can't articulate it to others. Got it :) Read the info in the sidebar, there is much to learn.

All rap music sucks and the people who listen to it are mouth breathing cretins. Don't even try to justify the artistic integrity of making rhymes about hookers, money, and fancy cars. It takes no talent to create... I mean, I can understand if I had no instrumental talent and couldn't sing or do anything, I might say to myself, I want to be a rapper. But fortunately I have an IQ higher than room temperature so that never happened.

Depends on the fund: if it's a highly aggressive, small cap index then yes, it is riskier than a large or mid cap. Generally the latter performs on a level with the market in general, which is to say you can expect a historical yearly return of ~6% (average of past 100 years performance). 
But really, no sound investor is going to invest everything in a high risk, small cap index fund. It's about allocating the money properly. If done properly, it's a pretty solid way to invest on a long term (ie. years or decades). No need to constantly think and shift balances around. It's not day trading.
@_date: 2014-07-10 21:30:22
Hmm, I guess I'm one of the few who read that as "one full bitcoin", since bitcoin is still the default unit of account. The fact that you can buy fractions of coins is a moot point, in that context.
@_date: 2014-08-12 19:56:16
Great news! You know what that means. Prepare for another flash crash!
@_date: 2014-07-11 18:48:46
Don't worry, even if bitcoin fails, the government will take care of you in your old age!

Thanks for the feedback, but that's only part of it, I actually wrote a few more paragraphs but I'm still working on editing to add some more points.
@_date: 2014-07-16 22:51:18
I love it. Everyone is giving up on the bubble hypothesis, which always means another one is around the corner. Sentiment is the best indicator, not lines on a graph. And right now, we are ripe for lift off.
@_date: 2014-07-18 16:49:56
When the market actually begins to pay attention to what's happening, the demand for bitcoins is going to be so huge. The amount of merchant adoptions in the past few weeks... absolutely mind blowing that we're still able to transfer cash into bitcoin for ~$620 USD.
@_date: 2014-07-18 16:20:35
wait do they have their bit license!?
@_date: 2014-07-23 19:14:10
your grandma keeps that one million in cash under her mattress? If she had invested it in an index fund, she'd have at least 10%+ return in the past 12 months.
I read your post, but if people are keeping large sums of cash at home, then they're either a drug dealer or just fucking stupid and asking for trouble.
@_date: 2014-07-16 22:54:48
All the pieces are falling into place. Easy, cheap way to convert cash to bitcoin, and soon the regulations and ETF will be hitting the market. I'm literally shaking here in my seat I'm getting so excited.
@_date: 2014-07-25 21:20:54
are you implying that all rappers are black or something? you're the fucking racist.
@_date: 2014-07-25 22:38:26
From a consumer standpoint: buying items at brick and mortar retailers isn't really the strength of bitcoin. It's best for online purchases and for sending sums of money to friends, family, or for trade. 
Bitcoin is like digital gold; it can be saved as a deflationary investment. But unlike gold, it can also be easily and cheaply transferred or spent if so desired, which is why it's superior.
@_date: 2014-07-10 19:52:28


obviously not... when you use paypal to send cash, you pay a fee, correct? For example, to send $1,000 to another party, it will cost you $30 ($1,030 ttotal). With bitcoin it's a few pennies. That's a pretty significant difference.
@_date: 2014-07-25 18:03:26
"Rap" and "genius" are kind of mutually exclusive terms, aren't they?
@_date: 2014-07-25 22:58:45
I'm sure I could also find a Christian rock or country song that I like, but I don't want to put the effort in to go through all the junk to find it. I actually like some of the older rap from my youth, but 99% of the stuff I hear sucks.
@_date: 2014-07-16 22:31:22
They don't need to "cash them out" anymore. When they need new electronics they can buy them on tigerdirect or newegg, bed sheets from overstock and soon they can even pay off their phone and tv bills. they can even buy airfare to visit their family members!

Just laying my feelings out on the community table, but now that you mention it, I suppose I did get a bit long winded.
@_date: 2014-07-16 22:10:36
it's a trick question. bitcoin is stored in "the cloud", not a physical three dimensional space.

I watched a show on cable television with Michio where he claimed that aliens may very well be flying around and observing us, but they don't make legitimate attempts to establish contact because we're seen as so inferior, much like humans watching ants, he said. This guy talks out of his ass so much, I don't really pay attention to what he says for anything other than a good hearty laugh now and then.

@_date: 2014-07-18 17:29:48
Crazy things happening, guys. I honestly think the public will look back at this period in 2014 as an "outlier" in the exponential growth trend of bitcoin. Basically, this is one the greatest buying opportunities ever in this paradigm changing technology.
@_date: 2014-08-14 22:57:54
And this will compel people to buy bitcoin... why exactly?
@_date: 2014-07-10 20:04:47
Of course we need new people to join the bitcoin ecosystem. You make that sound like a bad thing; but perhaps you've conditioned yourself to believe that bitcoin is a pyramid scheme. The truth is, a new currency needs investors, speculators, etc, in order to compete and eventually change the monetary landscape of the world economy. That's the goal.  And for the past five years, we've been chugging right along.
We don't need to convince anyone. If you're not interested, then that's totally fine. But one day, I guarantee you will look back and regret your decision when bitcoin is trading for &gt; 100x of today's value.
