I'm curious about this too
@_date: 2016-07-08 09:00:35
I'm selling BTC merchandise
I am not worried about the shifts in price.  I could adjust it manually if shift was real significant.
More important is that I am BTC throughout, and my prices , when viewed in Bitcoin in currency, are nice round numbers.  so 0.025 BTC might be the sales price.
@_date: 2016-07-08 08:26:33
there is no such option for bitcoin.

        Did Satoshi actually create that logo?

Why wouldnt it be a good idea?
my product is bitcoin, i am only accepting bitcoin, and i would like my items to have nice round numbers.
you think this will cause me other issues?
@_date: 2016-07-08 11:59:09
ok, that's a good idea; however my processing will be BTC also (blockchain.info API)
@_date: 2016-07-08 04:30:19
Exactly.  
I want the price to be exact in BTC.    So my half bitcoin product is exactly 0.5 BTC on the site. Any ideas?

When you say "make the devs", do you mean ask Shopify to do this, or get a programmer to make this manual change?
@_date: 2016-07-08 04:31:45
Correct.  It doesnt allow for BTC base currency, but you can find/see Bitcoin biz shopify sites with perfect round BTC sale prices. This must mean that they have customized or modded, right?  Anyone have any ideas?
Yeah, the workaround has to be a distant plan B.   Who wants to work with USD anyways? :P
