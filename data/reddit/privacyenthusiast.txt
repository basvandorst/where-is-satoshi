sum was set for 251,287 satoshi (the amount of cables leaked).
something failed, I do have 4mBTC so lack of funds is not the problem.

How about creating n-of-m multisig addresses using this method? The import/passphrase function does not recognize xprivparts (yet).

8 bits make a byte, I'll bite.

Bitcoind by default limits the number of connections to one per /24 subnet. This protects against a connection exhaustion DoS attack. Since you're running a VPS, odds are you're not the only bitcoin node in the datacenter.
Here are some iptables firewall rules that might help.
    
    # Allow eight connections per IPv4 /24 subnet
    -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 8333 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 8 --connlimit-mask 24 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
    # Allow two connection per IPv4 address
    -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 8333 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 2 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
    # Allow TCP connection if not rejected by the previous limit
    -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 8333 -j ACCEPT
