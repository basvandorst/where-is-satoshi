Thanks for the site. I used Nitrogen and put everything on the Seahawks and won =)
@_date: 2014-02-02 20:13:33
Seems it's pretty equal, seahawks are slightly underfavored.

This is what bit coin is for!
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:12:18
God some of you are dumb.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:26:14
I don't think it's gonna hit $200 anytime soon man, or I at least wouldn't gamble on this stuff.
I put $200 in just to play poker, you guys are crazy dropping in 6k, 10k etc.. just to maybe make money. Goodluck though hope you make something.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:45:24
do we really need a fucking price update thread everytime it shifts? Were all watching the same shit.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:20:27
I'm waiting to buy, i think it's gonna drop a lot more once mt.gox opens back up. There are huge pending sell orders and large investors planning to sell.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:32:02
It's going to crash more when mt.gox comes back.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:38:24
do people just buy/sell daily and make profit? It seems hard to buy/sell with coinbase or mt.gox cause it takes a while to even get the coin. So you can't really just sell it right away?
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:34:49
I did mine on thanksgiving so that's why I assume it took longer. His avg times were very low.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:00:56
Where do you buy sell from? Caues i'm on bitfloor I put a limit order in to buy at 86, and btce is showing $85 and it hasnt gone through.
But i'm not in it to make a lot ofm oney, i use bitcoins to play poker. But might as well buy as cheap as possible incase market explodes.
@_date: 2013-12-25 18:58:23
That's unfortunate, I like the size of the iPhone only reason I keep it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:25:40
Most likely more of a gamble so interactive would be best. Can I play with like $400 or is that too small.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:15:50
I'll get it to you when I get home i'm at school. I'm on my way to the bank to add funds to bitfloor.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:40:58
how many did you buy and at what price? I'm debating whether to buy in now or not.
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:52:50
ya sure i'll buy it all, just transfer me it first and then maybe i'll send the money to some stranger.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:39:30
It's at that right now..I'm waiting til mt.gox opens and crashes again then i'll buy in at around $20.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:26:13
ya you can transfer to your mt.gox wallet, then I suppose I could transfer from gox to another site. I pretty much just want to avoid mtgox.
Once bitfloor comes back up i'll be going to the bank to make a deposit with them.
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:56:24
Screw bitcoin you have any suggestions for buying into stock?
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:55:51
Who can afford to lose money. I wanna make money!
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:13:42
wait til gox opens. There was a hedge fund manager on twitter saying he was going to sell everything.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:52:00
Nope, there would be a bot confirm it was real. Just some idiot troll.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:11:15
Where can i view this live?
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:52:45
I'd like to know so I could do it 
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:30:59
YOU CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE!? YOU MUST BE A TRILLIONAIRE!
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:29:27
Whatd you do
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:13:33
It's up 300% in 2 days...
You guys expect it all to jump to 1k overnight without it going down at all.
None of us can see the future, so lets just be optimistic and hope for the best.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:33:41
I think I got it.
Not sure if i should hold for a possible drop with the mtgox trading, or buy cause people will buy before it's done.
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:36:22
Ahhh ok so it's actually stored on your phone app and doesn't pull funds from say your btc-e account or something. I get it now. Thanks 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:21:06
I used to use bitinstant when I played poker with it. But it transferred to my mtgox, and currently thats the only option to transfer to, so that's outta the question.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:08:22
Same here I missed my 5 o clock deposit time by minutes.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:18:38
I'm not buying on gox, i'm trying to use bitfloor but that's down now too.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:58:13
Is this a website?
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:29:33
Where can I BUY under 90 though. I have money in bitfloor and it's showing buy option at 100+
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:48:34
eh looks like that kinda stuff just isn't for us poor guys. Thanks for the info though.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:34:11
good thing I just transferred money to bitfloor, should post tomorrow morning if they are even up.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:47:38
Go to 
create an account, takes a minute.
then it will have a list of reputable vendors and their prices, and how they accept payment. I chose to buy from "coinseller" he has no negative feedback, and an average disbursement time of less than 2 hours.
You will enter how much money you wish to send/bit coins to buy. It will put the BTC in escrow until payment is made, you have created a buy order.
Go to the bank that is specified on the order, give them the info and money. Go home and push the button that says you have paid him.
Once seller sees money, he releases BTC from escrow into your account. Congrats you now have bitcoins.
From here you want to transfer it out of that site probably, into a web wallet or something else. I have a wallet on my PC and also use coinbase and btc-e.
Any questions let me know.
Keep in mind today is thanksgiving, some users may take longer to buy from today.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:19:13
What's website would I use? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:00:26
Ya you should wait til like 10am EST tomorrow so i'll have money in my acct ;)
@_date: 2013-12-25 18:57:25
I have it now! Thanks
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:02:05
From where, I can't buy from coinbase or mtgox?
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:14:52
constant crashes and DDOS attacks, still holding to buy.
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:26:44
Well if people are sending you stuff they are withdrawing those coins from somewhere. I just worded it poorly. I meant send.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:11:32
It's funny cause I've been using BTC for 4-5 months now. With this explosion of new people, everyone thinks they are better than others and just talk shit. They think everyone just uses it to trade now, I use it for poker. Oh well.
@_date: 2013-12-20 06:25:24
Invest In litecoins. It's currently at $20, it was at $40 before the drop. It will go back to $40 and beyond. That's and easy way to double your money. Bitcoin would have to hit almost 2k to double your money.
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:20:30
How exactly do transactions like this take place? I bought some coins off my friend recently. We both had to log in to btc-e, text him the public key, he copied and pasted, sent. Confirmed via email.
Seems like it should be easier?
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:54:46
I'm not trading, i'm buying 1 bitcoin. I play poker on SWC.
Thanks for not helping at all
This explosion sucks, now everyone just talks shit and thinks they are better than others are using BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-03 00:25:29
You think bitcoin is going to keep going up? I got $1500 i'm thinking about buying in with and seeing if I make anything.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:07:22
Hey beautiful you're looking extremely handsome today
 lol
good luck man, lucky you got in early.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:02:23
I did a deposit shortly after 5pm PST. hoping it posts after it sorts it's shit ought.
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:11:12
It was 30-40 before the big blow up, I don't think it'll drop below that.
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:36:03
Love and marriage love and marriage 
@_date: 2013-12-25 06:46:04
I know I can out my public key to a qr code. I just didn't know what apps scan it and connect it to withdrawal coins.
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:58:48
I just don't understand, sure everyone is buying and driving the price up thinking they're gonna make money. But WHY, what are any of these people actually using it for other than holding it trying to make money. I never held onto my coins, every coin I bought I spent within a week either on gambling or SR. People gotta spend it eventually.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:05:05
Wrong. I went on local bitcoins yesterday, created an order for $200 of btc. Drove to Wells Fargo with the guys acct number and name, transferred the money. Came home and had my coins soon after.  Which went up in value I believe 40% over night.
Extremely easy. Easier than sitting in a bank to open a new bank account, and they have all your information and there is no way around it. 
It's still a very new currency, things have to be hashed out. But I am confident it is the future of money. 
All that needs to happen is more businesses to accept Bitcoin, and a way to physically spend them like a debit card. When that happens. We won't need money anymore.
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:31:28
I'll invest, I have 1 btc. We're almost there!
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:57:50
Man I see a lot of people say this, it is so easy using localbitcoin.com
Directions are basically laid out on the site
Placed order, drove to bank and paid to the guys acct, had my coins within a couple hours .
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:14:55
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:12:38
bitfloor fuckin just crashed!!!
I'm leaving class early so I can deposit before the banks close. Mtgox is showing BTC above $100 now when it was just at $50. Nevermind mtgox is just retarded. Bitfloor is down though. Which probably means another price drop.
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:51:43
Sounds good thanks man 
@_date: 2013-11-17 10:22:22
Hey I'm not the only one! Welcome to my little shitty regret hole.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:11:02
Mortgage your house and sell your kids. Put your entire life into btc. Then get pissed when you lose it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:00:33
Which is my problem, I have cash in my bank account. How do I turn that into coins. I was using coinbase but there prices are ridiculous right now. Should I use bitinstant to mtgox? I'm afraid of mtgox crashing and I lose any money in that acct.
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:09:56
I keep all my coins on my PC in a wallet, encrypted and backed up on two drives.
I'm just trying to get the QR code thing down i'll google it and check it out, can't be too hard. Thanks man. 
Actually I just put all my money into LTC so the protocol might be different for that, but I still want to know how to do transactions with BTC in person, so i'll check it out anyways.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:10:41
You obviously don't know jack shit about BTC. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 06:11:59
You can transfer funds just like that with QR codes? Does this work on iOS? 
@_date: 2013-12-28 17:11:32
That's sad
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:16:21
doubt it.
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:01:11
litecoin buddy, was $10 couple days ago now it's 20
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:12:29
You just buy/sell all day? Through what bitfloor? I would like to try this. I usually just used coins to play poker.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:03:43
I store my coins on my PC and encrypt the wallet. Bitcoin.org you can download the software/wallet. It will take some time to sync up with block chain etc. 
It will have a deposit address, that's where you send the coins. They are now on your PC. Encrypt the wallet and do not forget that password or you will lose all your money. 
I'm at work on my phone I can try and explain better later. I mainly put money in litecoin but it's same concept. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 07:06:56
It's gone up $10 just In  24 hours, that's a 50% gain.
