If I was the real Satoshi Nakamoto, and I saw some poor guy getting all the flak for my invention, I think I'd get it out to the world to.
Just to get the heat off an innocent man.

No we love bitcoin for that because we've been able to think about it for 5 mins.
The average person is not capable of this, they live their life by media trends.
Alternate form of bitcoin, backed by massive media campaign, and bitcoin will be restricted to the conspiracy/libertarian crowd.

Was going to post that. I wonder if searching grandbazaar or druglizard will yield any gmail addresses.

Because it's not decentralized. It's centralized in the exchanges.
The "decentralized" part is only for the banking ledger, and that won't stop them from making money off of it.
Plus I'm pretty sure IBM invented the concept of decentralized computing, and I'm not sure anyone posting here is qualified enough to do the kind of mental backflips their R&amp;D team is capable of, so no telling what they could do with their own altcoin.

They are giant institutions. All they'd have to do is run an exchange and manipulate it like the current exchanges are doing.
Hell they can even manipulate the exchanges right now for very little off their budget.
Or pre-mine like a lot of the altcoin developers are doing.
There is a lot of ways to manipulate this currency, the only thing we've taken away is the banks ability to do that.

The dollar isn't crashing... yet. Buying power goes down for the dollar because the rich people aren't millionaires anymore, they're "hundreds of billions"aires.
When the USA did start to slide, it slid in relation to the Euro. Russia started formally trading in Euros instead of USD for oil, because they said the USD wasn't worth anything anymore. 
And that's what Greece/Spain/Italy were for, pull the rug out from under the Euro, by revealing that certain US banks had given them loans they could not repay, illegally to most of those countries laws. No punishment was given, because that's how the status quo works.
If you go to xe.com and look up the 10 year chart for the USD vs Euro you can see this war reflected in the charts from 2008 onwards.
But if you converted your Euros to USD, and then converted back to Euros, you could have made a fuck ton of cash in there, despite weakened buying power.
Seriously though, the dollar won't slide because it's only backed by 1 thing. The U.S. Military.
Until someone can displace their stranglehold, they will continue to keep the dollar as the gold-standard.
So far the only real challenge I've seen to this is the BRICs nation bank.

Wow this has all the signs of a learning disorder.
"How about the fact that all U.S.  taxes (the world's largest economy) must be paid in USD. That doesn't matter at all?
If you read the post, you'd see why that doesn't matter. To get into it all I'd have to explain to you how devaluation works, and it's not my fault you didn't get an education, that's your own problem.

It would have to be decentralized. Look at skype. It was decentralized to use your computer to route other peoples calls, saving them cash.
Or some gaming companies patch releases to torrents to boost speeds, and save on servers.
So if a company adopts a bitcoin like strategy, they can have all of you do the work, and make them all the money.
Then they just set up exchanges that can help you easily, and cheaply, change your bitcoins into FIAT currencies.
Considering companies were just green-lit by that regulatory hearing, I'd assume a lot of R&amp;D departments are already working on this.

How do I get my money from them without breaking the law?
It's pretty tricky to get bitcoins into real cash right now, without coming under the banks thumb.
It still goes (bank in &lt;exchange &lt;bitcoin &lt;exchange &lt;bank out) for most people. You could change bank out for merchandise out instead, but you then have to sell your merchandise, and turn it into real currency, which the norms won't do. 
For miners they don't have to deal with the first 2 parts really, just the last 2.
This is why the governments been tackling primarily the methods people use to turn bitcoin into real money, and they're diverting them to always go through a bank so they can make cash.
If that failed, they'd make an altcoin, hype it, and make it super easy to exchange.
The banks are going to get a cut of this no matter what.

I hate my assessment to. Unfortunately I've watched too many "he tried to make a difference, so the CIA had him kidnapped and dissolved in acid" documentaries.
But something like IBM, or Google, they could easily make their own altcoin, set up infrastructure super fast, and take over all the bitcoin business through just "better" service.
They'll use words like "protected, insured, legal" to get the norms on, and that's where the real future value of bitcoin lies, in the norms.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:28:04
Ya but he didn't say that. What he did seem to say is "ill own anything, no matter how overvalued, as long as it's trending, and I get out before the crash"
While the infrastructure being set up could help bitcoin, it could also just show other investors how easy this is to do.
GovCoin, UncleSamCoin, NSACoin, BankstrCoin anyone? Any large company could completely displace bitcoin and leave you fanboys clutching at cyber-nothings.
