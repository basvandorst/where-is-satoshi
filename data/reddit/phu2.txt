I'm going to leave that in there. Not even mad got Bitcoin. 500 bits @_date: 2014-11-11 13:32:58
The only one that didn't get bits in this thread...that's racist.

I've heard youtube is a good place. We should do some sort of bit tipping raid. Instead of a trolling raid we can do a tipping raid and change someone's day or life  for the better

As much as I dislike facebook I totally agree with you. have some bits. 100 bits @_date: 2014-11-11 04:56:23
I've heard about it for a while but I just started today myself.  Been Trying To Get A Tip But I have nothing worth saying at the moment I guess. I found a paper wallet today with .05 btc and decided to jump on this changetip bandwagon

I have no idea. That would be kind of cool though. Make it rain on some youtuber. We need a term when a mob just tips away on a particular person. Any ways have 300 bits @_date: 2014-11-11 03:57:22
I like it. Lets see if this gets some steam behind it. 200 bits
@_date: 2014-11-11 04:44:20
Very true. Have some bits. 100 bits @_date: 2015-01-30 20:54:05
I bought mine the same day this happened and was thinking of returning it. I'll keep it now and probably get one as a gift.

I'll donate to an organization that helps animals/pets (dogs, cats, etc). Need to do research to make sure the majority of the donation actually goes to the animals and not some CEO. Any suggestions?

I'm in. Let me know the details.

You live you learn. He handled it very well in my opinion and the guy is a class act. He is in a very stressful position and I have the utmost respect for him. Now, about the bull run.....
