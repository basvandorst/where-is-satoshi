A block size increase is a fork.  Btc wants to scale without a fork.  if you haven’t noticed, people seem to support btc in the market.  It has gone up quite a bit lately.  Now, where it goes from here is anyone’s guess, but I think there are some smart dudes working on a solution and brighter minds and more powerful people than any of us are really out there determining bitcoin’s fate.  Before you formulate a solution, perhaps you should dig into the technical aspects of the monster btc has become before you just jump to a conclusion and think you have the solution.  I think if you did this you might come to the realization that you are not really in a position to have an informed opinion on the way forward.

People don’t understand bitcoin and the concept of cryptocurrency and blockchain and they missed the bus and want to hate.  I’m not saying bitcoin should be worth 15k a coin, but the concept is awesome and probably plays a big part in the future. So instead of hating they should just go learn how bitcoin and blockchain work.  There might be something to it.  Or they can put their fingers in their ears and scream LaLaLa which is what anyone completely ignoring this trend is doing.

Coinbase is fine but you pay higher fees.  Gdax is the exchange behind coinbase and you can login to it through coinbase then buy and sell with much lower fees.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:08:48
You would think something retaining value against standard currency for what?  Over 7 years now obviously has value to some people.  Saying it is worth zero is pure ignorance.  Saying it is not worth 16k is either talking about traded value in the past or a prediction of the future.  No one knows the future.  I can get on gdax right now and sell bitcoin for whatever it is trading for.  So as of right now you are absolutely wrong and maybe in the future it is worth zero.  Based on past performance I doubt it is worth zero any time soon.  Dig deeper or leave.  You are adding zero to the conversation.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:04:24
well at this point if you are looking for quick gains, you might need to go speculating on alts.  Bitcoin needs more rocket fuel, so people dumping fiat into alts might give it that so it can blast up from here.  Hell if I know though.  Maybe the whole thing tanks to zero tomorrow.  That’s the fun.  No one really knows.

I would bet my house he is wrong and bitcoin will indeed drop below 10k at least once between June and the end of the year.  Dumbass call.  Just as idiotic as the rest of them like 1M bitcoin and that dumbass calling 15k ether this year.  
@_date: 2018-05-13 03:26:47
Uh, well if you bought that shit on an exchange and transferred it, they know you have it.  If you bought it off a person and they bought it off an exchange, they still could know you have it.  If you mined it maybe but bitcoin is a very transparent blockchain.  If you use Monero or zcoin in a certain way then get bitcoin off a decentralized exchange, maybe then you are right.

I like bad crypto because every once in a while it is really funny.  I’ll toss out a terrible one too, captain crypto is a bunch of ignorant kids.  “Smart millennials put all their money in crypto”.  “I’ll never have a 401k”. Those are pretty much direct quotes from those idiots.  Good for a laugh I suppose.
@_date: 2018-10-01 18:08:27
Good to know,  I just started using this exchange and didn’t have a problem depositing ether, making a trade and withdrawing.  It was not a lot of money though.  I plan to keep amounts pretty small if I keep using them and I go in with the plan deposit, trade, withdraw.  I don’t plan to keep anything on the exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:05:37
Read some books.  Reddit is typically just full of bullshit and not a lot of meaningful discussion.  I recommend “the book of Satoshi” and “digital gold”.  Also if you are interested in a traders point of view I highly recommend coin mastery on YouTube.  He does an episode every weekday and doesn’t just focus on bitcoin.  Even his past episodes are relevant because he focuses a lot on concepts that are useful to think about and can be applied to any type of market.

I run nice hash for the hell of it.  Pays out in btc and people bid on hash power mostly for mining alts.  Anyway I’m probably spending more in electricity than the bitcoin I get, but I have a few gaming pcs so figure I might as well have them do something.  If bitcoin skyrockets it might cover for my electricity cost.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:07:46
Interesting.  Really any of the large pools could potentially decide to attack a particular small crypto, especially any asic one with not a lot of hash on it.  I don’t think we have seen anything like this yet.  I’m not sure what it would accomplish though.  They could try to double spend by reversing transactions.  Depends on the structure of the coin.  
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:50:24
Well it is in the sense that you have gotten your feet wet and learned how it works, to a degree.  Some fun things you can do for free are download the bitcoin core client, download the entire chain and run a full node for a little while.  If you can afford to eat some transaction fees send some bitcoin to your full node for fun and check out the transaction in the client.  There are also commands you can use in the client to do some pretty cool shit.  It also lets you specify the transaction fee so you can try sending some bitcoin elsewhere with a low transaction fee and see how long it takes to get to the destination.  If bitcoin does what people think it might be capable of your 20 could be 200 in a few years.  So that’s something.  Anyway it’s a start and if you are serious about bitcoin and believe in it there are strategies to invest some over time, like $20 a week.  The problem with that is fees so you need to get a bank account on an exchange like gdax so fees are a lot better.  Learn about dollar cost average investing.  
Anyway $20 worth at this point wont be much unless bitcoin really does go absolutely crazy over the next 5-10 years, but it’s a start.  Everyone starts somewhere.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:14:08
Oh that real economy where most payments are digital as it is and large corporations have a monopoly on the network and getting in is ridiculously expensive due to regulation?  This new economy allows cheap transfer of assets, speculation on new businesses, simple and safe and private exchange between individuals anywhere on the planet and is a global 24 hour market anyone with a phone can participate in.  A joke coin, dogecoin is gaining value against the dollar and I don’t see that changing.  If I had to take a bet if dogecoin will destroy the dollar in 2018 in terms of value, I’d take that bet.  People want alternative currencies and they are here.  Maybe the space is overvalued and bitcoin is overvalued, but you have to be clueless if you really think people don’t want this new economy and think this is not “real”.  This is fucking real and it’s competitive and no doubt scary for government and big business because it enables investment and currency use and if you don’t like your currency you can always trade it for another or go back to fiat.  Just like if you don’t like any other product you can get something else.  This is turning money into a product giving people more choice.  That’s not “real”?  Is “real” being pretty much forced to use what your government demands.?  This will make countries have to improve their currency because currency will become competitive.  Shitty currency will lose eventually and right now as much as I hate to say it the dollar is falling behind.  If next year is huge we will see how countries try to control it or embrace it.  If next year cools off I think things will get into motion the year or two after that.  2017 has already been phenomenal.

Can’t say for sure but I know some have limits on how much you can buy or sell and if you do prove identity you can buy or sell more.  You should just go check one out.  
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:28:45
This is the wrong mindset if you have no bitcoin.  You need to get in the game.  The easiest way to “beat” the market is to dollar cost average your way in.  For example if you have $1000. Buy $100 worth now and buy $100 worth each week for 10 weeks.  That way on average you are getting it at an average price.  Sure you can try and time the market but it is very difficult.  Even experts cannot call it.  Buying some over time reduces your risk tremendously.  Once you have a stack then you can try to time dips to get bitcoin cheaper than you did in the past thus bringing your overall cost per bitcoin down.  It is almost impossible to call the bottom.  No one knows if we will see 5k,4k,3k or less bitcoin ever again.  Good luck.  Oh and if you learn what market orders are and get some usd on an exchange you can set buy orders and buy the dips automatically.  Sure you might miss the bottom but it might get you a good discount while you sleep.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:00:18
Hey dude if you want to be more safe about speculating on segwit2x you should hold your bitcoin and get both and forget about it during the fork and in the meantime you should go buy up some segwit2x futures at a super heavy ass discount.  That way if segwit2x fails you don’t get completely screwed and the upside is huge if segwit2x actually becomes the main chain as you will have your original coin on both chains and all your futures will rocket up in value, assuming people value segwit2x and it becomes bitcoin.  What will actually happen?  Fuck if I know.  I don’t know if miners have the balls to fuck over btc, they definitely hold the keys and the market drives their decisions for the most part.  It’s a game with enough possibilities that no one knows what will happen.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:03:22
Kind of misses the point.  You can still buy any amount of bitcoin.  Even a fraction still could multiply and be a good investment.  Also we are going to correct and I’m not going to be shocked if we go back down under 4k at some point.  
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:50:48
It will be risky to dump either side right after the fork.  So no, the move is not clear.  The safest move is hold your private keys.  I think the next safest is park it on a respectable exchange.  I don’t think coinbase/gdax fucks this up but no one can say for sure.
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:06:44
Go look at stock charts.  Nothing just goes up and up, as shit goes up people with it have to consider if they want to sell some.  Some people can get out of the game now and never work another day in their life.  So they sell thinking even if it continues up they don’t want to take the risk of it going way down.  Others have weak hands and panic sell.  Others bought the top and want to cut their losses also weak hands.  It’s market economics 101.  
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:39:46

Bitcoin is super liquid to all the alt coins.  All the alt coins are super liquid to bitcoin and ethereum.  But the alts are not super liquid to each other.  So it depends what is happening but lots of people will speculate on alts when bitcoin jumps because some alts will no doubt have more upside than bitcoin.  This pulls the price of bitcoin down a bit.  During surges of bitcoin some people get fomo and pull out of some alts.  This back and forth is very healthy and just part of the price discovery for crypto in general.  Look at overall market cap to keep an eye on when big money is moving in or out of crypto.  There is no dilemma here.  Nothing simply rises forever.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:43:46
This is the prevailing opinion at the moment which makes me think it won’t happen exactly like this, time will tell.  I hope btc survives.  What I’d like to know is how hard will bitcoin cash pump in the run up and during the fork.  It will be crazy as fuck I’m almost certain and we will see shit no one is predicting.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:56:51
I think it will likely be ok.  Coinbase is a monster and I think they have a lot of smart people working for them.  If you want to be safe just hold both coins for a bit after the split and see how it goes.  It will be interesting to say the least.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:11:50
I think this is a scary and kind of awesome thing about bitcoin.  It brings people to the table who would probably never mess with stocks and gets them learning.  In turn it also brings even more volatility to this crazy ass market.  And it runs 24 hours a day and is global.  Perfect storm for crazy shit.  Welcome aboard.  
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:38:44

Pump and dump is basically pump the price of a coin by either trying to talk it up to people on the internet or over the phone back in the day and get people believing it will go up, so they start buying and it goes up just based on the speculation that it will be worth more in the future.  Another technique is to buy up a small order book so the price looks like it is skyrocketing and people jump in the fray looking for a quick buck.  Whoever bought it up watches the action and dumps a bunch on the way up and back down and ends up making a lot more than if they had just sold at market price.  If you want a classic chart example of pump and dump check out Unobtainium a few weeks back.  It was pumped from $50 a coin up to over $400 in around one day and is now back to $50.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:42:23
They are planning to safely split their coins.  If you have your bitcoin on coinbase or gdax you will get coin on both chains and be able to withdraw or deposit from both chains pretty soon after the fork if they pull it off.  I’m sure they are expecting most volume to be trading so they have some time to split coins safely, verify them and use them if customers want to transact on either chain.  No guarantee they don’t fuck something up, go down, or whatever.  I’d say it’s not a bad option if you are not an expert and don’t have a lot of bitcoin.  If you are either of those there might be better options.

@_date: 2017-11-02 00:44:07
Yeah I’m just saying anyone who actually expects segwit2x to win can have massive gains if they are right and also devastating loses if they are wrong.  If instead they take some bitcoin they can gamble and put some in s2x futures, however it goes they will not be fucked and if it goes their way they can have a huge win.  Hell I’ve considered buying some s2x futures with cash and I think it will probably tank immediately.

He asked how to get into bitcoin and those books are great.  How money got free is another good one but covers a lot of the same ground as digital gold.  If he really wants technical knowledge mastering bitcoin is a great book.  It’s really dense though.

@_date: 2017-11-01 21:37:16
This is good for people who have no idea how forks work.  So far I say good on coinbase for basically implementing replay protection for their users.  Sure it is unknown how long your private keys will be locked on the exchange, but they will expose near market trade rates and make it simple to buy and sell, which is commendable if they pull it off.  They don’t want segwit2x to fuck them or their users in the ass and I think their plan is pretty good.  I think they learned their lesson from bitcoin cash.  I’m looking forward to hear how other exchanges handle it.
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:06:27
Yeah it sucks but that site is not everyone’s entry.  It’s probably a small percentage of people.  Anyone buying on coinbase is getting the real bitcoin.  Ver is out to destroy BTC and take over bitcoin even if it implodes the crypto economy for years to come.  All we can do is try and make people aware of what is going on.

You must be new.  Go look at the bitcoin chart from the beginning.  Recognize that a lot of people putting money in this have no fucking idea what they are buying.  That is a recipe for serious volatility and panic.  We are in full on FOMO now but it will swing both ways.  I’m not calling 4k, but I’m not ruling anything out.  It will absolutely drop below 6k in the next month.  I would bet most anything on that.  Hit me up in a month and tell me I was wrong or right.  Either way I don’t really care.

You do not understand how the encryption of bitcoin private addresses works.  Using the address more than ones just increases risk for identifying you, and letting people know what you own, not cracking the encryption.  No one with the power capable of cracking it will give a shit about Your transactions.  There are plenty of addresses worth millions and millions of dollars and anyone can view them right now.  It’s fucking public, if you know shit about bitcoin you would know this already.  They will go for those.  Using a different address is simply good practice to help keep your identity and net worth more private.  Here is an example.  If you use a wallet you sent 5 bitcoin to on one address.  When you spend some, even a fraction, the transaction contains a few transactions.  First the bitcoin you send, second the bitcoin sent back (or retained) on your address and a transaction fee.  So if you did this to buy a cup of coffee the vendor can easily examine the blockchain and see hey this guy has a decent stack of bitcoin.
One thing I hate about bitcoin is the rampant ignorance and people claiming they know how the fuck it works.  You don’t.  If you want to learn information is out there.  
Edit, holy shit your stupid quantum computer comment.  Quantum computers might be a threat to break the encryption algorithms used in bitcoin.  Using a different address doesn’t do dick to protect your not very valuable addresses.  Again no one with the power to do this will give a shit about your transactions unless you have an address worth millions upon millions of dollars.

You will have to convince yourself to get into this crazy market.  Bitcoin is absolutely not a currency at this point.  It currently is perceived as a store of value from past performance and it can be used to speculate on new assets.  It is the original crypto and is a proof of concept and has worked for 9 years now.  All the other crypto are standing on the shoulders of a giant.  I think crypto has enough valid use cases that it will exist in another 5 years but will look a lot different than it does now.  Ultimately what is amazing about it is anyone can participate and nothing can stop them.  You just download software and off you go.  Right now we are in serious price discovery phase.  Traditional institutions are hesitant and I’m sure nervous because in the end who gets to decide if this is the future we want is people.  If it develops as I expect it will give people an easy way to switch to whatever currency they want.  We won’t have to go through banks and governments or even exchanges.  We won’t have to rely on them nearly as much.  I think people want that.  The speculation is a ton of people want that.  We will enter a critical juncture where either traditional institutions control these things or people control them.  I don’t know what the fuck happens I can just say it is the most interesting space right now and I’m consumed with learning about it.

Faster blocks is not better.  You don’t understand my argument.  Look at blocks found more recently.  They are being found very fast for bch and they are mostly empty.  This favors miners.  Note whoever is mining bcash now is doing it at a loss.  The equalizer is fast blocks.  Giving miners super fast blocks so they can stack bitcoin cash faster is not better.  It’s garbage.  Bcash could just adjust the difficulty so it’s 1 minute blocks.  More bcash to the miners who can also buy it up and limit the supply then go manipulate exchanges.  It’s the Dash method.  It works I suppose but btc is better designed.  Blocks are difficult and much more hash is working them.

Because it is super speculative.  If any ico manages ties with major business that’s a huge win for the ico but not necessarily the business.  I will mention taas here though which is basically a fund that speculates on icos they believe in and it pays quarterly payouts of the profits they make to coin holders.  So any ico who gets them to buy in usually bodes well for the ico.

Hope is usually not a good thing in investments.  If you are in for the long run be safe.  Have you kept up with coin mastery on YouTube?  I think he is a smart guy and gives good advice.  He says he has 70% of his crypto in cold storage and only plays wit 30%.  I think that is a smart strategy.  Don’t let anything wreck you.  If you like s2x and think it has a good chance of becoming the dominant chain you can get some futures and not risk everything.  All in on s2x is risky as hell but if it happens you will have a windfall.  It’s kind of like betting on a horse that is a 6 to 1.  You put it all on that and you are either fucked or you hit big.

Pure ignorance.  It was not created properly yet has survived for 9 years?  Some fork with shady developers and backers is better?  Just because they upped the blocksize and made it shittier to start by giving miners huge advantage to be able to speed mine it?  And after the adjustment they are still speed mining it.  Go look at average block time.  Also note the tiny blocks.  Hardly anyone is using the blockchain.  It’s a coordinated attack and if you ask Roger Ver he has been quoted lately on a podcast saying bitcoin cash will overtake bitcoin, probably within a few months.  He then gloats like he always does saying he has always been right about bitcoin.  According to Roger, Roger is always right.  The market right now says he is wrong.  Time will tell but the Day bitcoin cash overtakes btc is likely the day I exit bitcoin and I doubt I’m the only one.

It’s not as big of a problem as people touting bcash think.  There is a lot of spam transactions on the chain to make you think it’s a problem.  There is a solution in the pipeline not requiring a hard fork.  Just go look at the developers behind bcash compared to btc.  It’s a joke.  Good luck.

That site sounds cool.  Hopefully someone knows what you are talking about.  To me the most fascinating thing about bitcoin and crypto in general is anyone with a computer can create an account anywhere anytime they want and can send or receive transactions between them and anyone else on the planet directly and discreetly.  Of course getting currency to bitcoin or turning bitcoin into other currency is harder, but it's still amazing and empowering.  All you need is knowledge of how bitcoin works to use it.

I think it is lower than 80%.  Anyway that includes thousands of nodes.  So thousands of nodes would have to go rogue and do it without the other nodes knowing and risk disrupting the integrity of bitcoin.  You need to realize each of these nodes has serious investment in the infrastructure to be able to compete for blocks and has a substantial holding of bitcoin.  They don’t want to devalue their coin.  What you are proposing is very risky and very difficult.  Even if they managed to compromise the system they couldn’t steal assets.  They could reverse their transactions.  I’m sure people have been trying to think of ways to compromise bitcoin for years now and no one has done it.  In the meantime the network has just grown in power exponentially making compromising it more and more difficult.  I’m not saying it’s impossible but it is extremely unlikely.  It will be the heist of the century if it happens.
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:33:06

Not necessarily.  What if you know someone with a bunch of cash and will buy it from you at a decent discount?  There is no way for anyone to prove who that cash went to since you cannot derive identity out of that public key.  They would have to physically witness you take the cash.
Bitcoin is crazy because you can hide a shit ton of assets behind your brain alone.   
@_date: 2017-09-13 01:46:49
Most people do not understand how it works.  I know lots of smart people and unfortunately none of them got into bitcoin until recently and that was my brother.  I ask people about it and they are just clueless.  It is going to take massive education and I think better, more trustworthy companies for more people to jump on board.  What is does is absolutely astounding.  Anyone on the planet can create a bitcoin account and transmit value anywhere almost instantly.  That is ridiculous and awesome.  And yeah you are right, most people just put up with the current system because it is all they know, and it works well enough.
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:25:59

Whelp you are most likely wasting your time, but it could be fun to try.  Either way you will very likely never get any coins mining because you are up against server farms with countless gpus.  The odds you find a hash first are about the same as hitting the lottery.  Good luck though.

The tech allows individual privacy control.  Look at the eqiufax shit.  Should some asshole shitty company really have that much sensitive individual data?  Hell no.  The problem is we as individuals have given up our private data time and time again out of convenience and now that data storage is so cheap and fast and companies have so much of it, a single breach can have implications for millions of individuals.  That is ridiculous.  I'm not saying bitcoin is perfect but it is a step in the right direction.  Two individuals being able to prove something without anyone else anywhere on the planet is really amazing when you think about it.  Barrier to entry is also tiny, transfer can be anonymous.  Hiding shit on a public ledger is possible.  The more you dig into blockchain the more you think about how it really could be a revolution.  It's easily as exciting to me as the internet was as it was emerging when I was a teenager.  So many amazing things came after and young people take them all for granted.  I'm pretty sure we are in for a decent ride over the next 10 years.

You need to read more about bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general.  It helps humanity by being a worldwide currency where anyone can open an account and send value directly to anyone else on the planet in a secure fast way with low transaction fees.
Miners are not solving a puzzle.  They are competing at generating random numbers until they get close enough to a solution to an impossible problem that they are awarded some bitcoin and ensure a block of secure transactions.  I know that sounds complicated.  It is a very high level explanation. They waste resources doing this because they are making more bitcoin than losing money.  If they were losing money they wouldn't do it.  If everyone threw all their computing resources at bitcoin everyone would lose money and some would drop out.  So it's en equilibrium.  Right now there are something like 10000 active nodes.  Hard to say how any are mining and how many are actually winning blocks but it is a lot and the decentralized nature of this very powerful network of people competing ensures the stability of the network.  If somehow the value of bitcoin went to $0 the miners would lose interest, but as it is now there are a lot of miners with a very serious vested interest in keeping bitcoin going.   If they come to the point where they believe they can no longer profit from bitcoin they will drop out which in turn makes mining a little easier and someone else will probably take their place.  It is hard to say how centralized this will become over time but it is doubtful any entity will ever have the power to overpower the network.  I could go on but recommend getting some books if you are really interested to learn more.

Yeah, so once the fork happens you can spend, verifying transactions with the same private key on either chain.  As for the logistics of that it should become clear as we get closer to the fork.  I don’t really understand the replay attack risk aspect though, so i intend to just hodl for a few days and see what people are saying.

It would be cool to have a more distributed network but you have to remember bitcoin was the first of its kind and now the network has tremendous value.   The current model pretty much works and assures a lot of high dollar competition to mine which secures the network.  I actually think a small incentive to run a full node would be better.  Hell I run a full node for free because I think it's cool but if I got a fraction of a coin every once in a while it would be better and I'm sure a ton of people would do it which would speed up the network and make it even more robust.

If it's someone you give a shit about sit them down in front of their computer.  Download bitcoin core.  Watch for a little while explaining that they are now downloading the entire public history of bitcoin transactions, viewable by anyone in the world.  Show them the empty wallet.  Send this new wallet 5 dollars or something.  Ideally from a wallet, not an exchange.  Explain that transaction will appear on their computer once it has downloaded the entire ledger.  Then have them send a dollar back.  I think more people need to see this process to understand it.  Even people who have bought some bitcoin don't understand it,  they just know they opened a coinbase account and have a balance of bitcoin.  People are not accustomed to the idea of an electronic money exchange between just two people without fiat, or bank accounts or something else in the middle.  Have them participate in another method.  I think a light goes off for a lot of people when they do.

For sure it was a good investment in the past,  but there have been long periods of stagnation, multiple major panic selling periods, lots of volatility, tons of negative media along the way.  These things have made bitcoin what it is today.  Without the constant redistribution and crazy speculation and such we would not have 5k bitcoin.  Lots of times along the road many people thought it was at the end of the road and here we are closing in on an all time high.  No one can say for certain if it is a good investment.  The advantages of bitcoin are obvious to anyone who investigates it, but I’ve read a shit ton and still cannot explain why a bitcoin should be the equivalent of 5k USD.  That’s a lot of money.  Anyway I suspect we are still on the upswing over the next few years, as do most people in this sub.  Everyone trying to make a buck or at least enjoy the show.

It is one of the problems someone is going to get very rich by solving or even getting closer to solving.  First step is more education about what cryptocurrency is and getting people to understand how secure it is.  Lots of people just took that leap but lots more wouldn’t dare touch it without more understanding.
As for what we have now, the trezor and ledger Nano are good devices but still too complicated.  A lot of people simply do not trust themselves.  I’m sure a ton of people on this sub just have crypto on exchanges instead of a hardware or software wallet.  What is needed is a foolproof way to regenerate a unique address that is easy to remember.  But you also need an easy way to pass it on to multiple people if you die.  The thought of outright losing a fortune to the ether is unfathomable to most people.  So we trust in institutions.  
I don’t know the answer.

This question will come up every fucking time bitcoin is going up and hitting all time highs and no one can tell you for sure.  Maybe this is it, maybe bitcoin bottoms out here and never goes higher.  Maybe it goes to $20,000 and beyond.  No one can say for sure.  There are many strategies if you believe bitcoin will go up long term.  Put in a bit of money each month and ignore the price, just accumulate some bitcoin and if it goes up over time your stack will too.  Or you can attempt to buy in the dips, whatever.

Crypto has stupid amazing utility.  People just don't understand it yet.  I think that is a major barrier.  I consider myself pretty smart and still keep coming up with questions and have to research it.  I decided to diversify my 401k by taking a loan against it and tossing it in bitcoin.  We shall see if it was a good move or not in 5 years when the loan is paid back and I compare what my 401k would look like against my 401k+bitcoin.  Who knows but damn at least it's really exciting.

Yeah when I look at volume it is a bit higher but it's not a huge difference over typical volume.  I think we may be stabilizing around 4k.  Lots of people saw that 5k hit and think that just can't be the peak so are probably buying at a bit below 4k because it seems like an ok deal.  I'm in for the long haul so don't really care.  I look at this crap day to day because I'm still pretty new to the currency but I think I'm prob better off reading books to learn more about bitcoin than watching Reddit.  I'm half way through mastering bitcoin and damn, I'm a programmer and it's still going to take multiple reads for me to really understand the system.

Mass adoption of bitcoin can potentially hit into bank profits and leverage big time.  Of course they want to devalue it.  They are obligated to for their shareholders.  Behind the scenes they are thinking of how to use blockchain for their own gain and limit the impact of crypto.  This, regulation, adoption rate, practical use cases, and visibility are the crucial issues which will ultimately determine the future of bitcoin and other crypto currencies.  Powerful institutions will simply not stand on the sideline anymore.  I don’t think they want to see cryptocurrency turn into a trillion dollar business.  That is a lot of money out of their control.  Think about it, banks typically leverage 97% of their assets to make more money.  If people are holding substantial assets in crypto they can’t lend that to people and make money on it.  A really interesting prospect of crypto is people leveraging their own assets like a bank does.  I’m not saying we don’t need some of the functions banks provide but the way in which bitcoin operates renders a lot of their functions inefficient by stupefying orders of magnitude.  Most people just don’t realize it.

For $60 just throw it in.  It can take days to get verified on the various sites.  If you want to wait at least go ahead and create a coinbase and kraken account and get it ready to go.

Ok so you are saying these sites will check what would happen if a transaction were submitted to the chain so in essence if you test sending a tiny amount of bitcoin and don't specify output, the transaction fees plus the send will be the total amount of value?

Most people still won’t be their own bank.  They will trust someone.  For instance require two parties to move large amounts of money.  Like it could require a bank and someone.

@_date: 2017-10-03 20:58:49
Does gold have value?  It’s a rock you could throw at someone or use as a paperweight.  Does paper currency have value?  You can burn it to stay warm.   Bitcoin obviously has value right now.  Someone can send a little transaction to anyone else on the planet and no one on the planet can stop them and the person who received it can cash it out into fiat or whatever.  The ability to do that has value.  If you want to argue a bitcoin should not be worth what it is, that’s fine, but the system has value as a system to conveniently transfer value right here and now.  
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:20:11

That's what I'm saying.  Can you get a copy of the blockchain, take that offline then determine the value of a private key completely offline.  I know it will only be as up to date as the last confirmed block of the backup.  But it seems a logical way to check a balance completely offline.
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:42:19
Impossible to say but from every indication we have for the next 5-10 years we should be fine.  A more difficult encryption standard will be adopted way before the current one is a threat and everyone will move their coins to that.  Sure there may be a race to discover old keys and whoever discovers them will reap the rewards.  Kind of like how people searched for sunken ships over the years.  Or there could be a year or so where the bitcoin developers say you need to send over your coin to the new standard or you lose it and stop processing transactions for keys produced under the old standard.  Who knows, time will tell.   If you want to delve into this topic there is software right now you can run to try and find keys.  From what I've heard it has not been very successful in finding much of anything.  
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:41:31
Option 1
Move your bitcoin to a wallet instead of an exchange.  Then wait and see what happens the day of and a few days after the fork and don’t act until you are certain it is safe.  Any wallet (hardware or software) where you control your private keys is fine.
Option 2
Keep your shit on an exchange and hopefully they explain what they are going to do before the fork.  If you are satisfied, keep your shit there, if not consider option 1.  You may get screwed like coinbase customers who kept a lot of bitcoin on the exchange and will not get their bitcoin cash until next year, at which point it might be worthless or close to it.  If you value control get your shit off exchanges.
Option 3
Cash out or convert your bitcoin to alts before the fork, see what happens, buy back in if you want to.
Option 4
Do nothing and see what happens.
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:39:18
Well there are two banks behind wires with security procedures and you have somewhere to go if something goes wrong.  My bank immediately made a copy of the printout I gave them and let me compare the transaction they sent with my printout so I ensured the reference number was exact and the bank info correct.  So in person it seems like a good procedure and I can't argue with getting my money on the exchange the same day.  Coinbase lets you do it with a credit card which I think really is not terrible.  The fees are higher but it's an almost instant transfer.  All the exchanges have their ups and downs.  
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:48:40
One of the crucial things to understand about bitcoin is transactions are one way.  You can only send bitcoin from one or multiple addresses to one or multiple addresses.  There is no acknowledgement from the receiving address, it simply gains value once the transaction is confirmed into a block.

Yeah I'm almost certain they have a large buffer.  When you buy on coinbase you are paying a premium.  When you sell on coinbase you are selling at a discount.  If you are smart you trade on gdax/kraken.  If you have a coinbase account you also have a gdax account.  Send your bitcoin there and trade there.  Gdax is kind of like kraken.  It's a market where you set a price you want to sell or buy at and wait.  If you are ballpark market the transaction will likely be quick, but if you lowball you might have to wait a while.  Coinbase makes this easier by just selling to you a bit high or paying out a bit low and they love it, they bank the extra.  Basically coinbase is great for crypto newbies and kraken/gdax and the others are great for traders and more experienced buyers.  There is a place for each of them.  As for if coinbase could screw people, sure it could happen.  I think it's unlikely, but you never know.  Especially if they get hacked.  So in general it is good practice to pull most of your assets to a personal wallet and the you are the protection and the backup.  Of course this means you assume the risk.  The choice is up to you.

Great book.  I also recommend “how money got free” which is basically a more detailed version of digital gold with some more perspectives and stories.  Also “the book of Satoshi” is a good compilation of Satoshi’s posts and if you want to delve into the technical “mastering bitcoin” is good.  
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:33:31
The bitcoin podcast network is ok.  Bad crypto is kind of entertaining.  Analysis in chains is decent.  Coin mastery is good.  Unfortunately no bitcoin/crypto podcasts really jump out to me though.  I just check in with these and a few others.  I can recommend books,  “digital gold” is really good and I’m reading “how money got free” which is kind of similar but also really good.  If you want to delve into the technical aspects of bitcoin, “mastering bitcoin” is a good book for that. It gets technical but has some nice overview sections too.  You can also go watch Andreas Antonopoulos (author of mastering bitcoin) talks on YouTube.  He has tons of interesting things to say.  
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:43:34
Why the hell is coinbase asking for your LOGIN to your bank account?  They should just need the account and routing   I’m not sure what the hell you did.  Anyway if you gave them that it takes a while to verify it.  They will make some small transactions that you need to verify and then you will be all set.
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:01:45
Well it isn't that simple but yes there are two keys, one public and one private.  To try and derive the private key is much more expensive computationally than simply throwing the cpu power at the blockchain and try and win transactions and the key reward for each block.  Even if you did manage to find a private key through supreme luck, it would likely be of no value or someone probably transferred the value somewhere else.  It's a moot discussion at this point but may get interesting in 10 years.  5 is very optimistic for how computing power has increased over the past decade.

Good question,  I’m assuming the smart people at gdax are taking that 4 hour window after the fork to safely get all their bitcoin on both chains safely and in different addresses.  Then they can start doing transactions on either chain without worrying about replay attacks.  How they do it exactly is fairly complicated.  I’ve seen explanations in the past to do with timing and such.

It will require the complete collapse of the dollar.  Probably not in our lifetime
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:42:16
Ok, I’ll try to guess.  It just depends on some trustless system for crypto currency exchange.  Similar to how bitcoin works but you submit a signed transaction with a condition and the other party does the same.  They both get into this new decentralized exchange blockchain and if they are both signed properly the exchange happens and transactions are submitted to the blockchains of the respective currencies being traded.  Now the issue is who gets the fees.  It could work just like bitcoin in that there is some sort of coin and miners earn it processing transactions.  This would really put the hurt on existing exchanges but people still need to get fiat in and out of crypto so there is a place for traditional exchanges.  
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:11:25
If that happens without the complete collapse of the dollar I will eat my own dick on national television.
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:02:40
It’s a bunch of pricks writing about money right?  Most likely most of them ignored bitcoin and missed the bus getting rich from it and are jaded.  They want to see it crash hard yet again and it probably will so they can say “told ya so”.  Media sentiment about bitcoin skews negative, it always has, but I think general sentiment has moved more toward positive in the past few years.  Who knows but don’t expect shit like Forbes to conclude bitcoin has a super bright future.  Attention is attention and will drive people to investigate for themselves, which I think is a good thing,
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:53:12

A transaction will be seen by the network almost immediately.   That is good enough for small transactions.  The merchant knows it’s there and can look at the details and knows it cannot easily be reversed.  The only real risk is if it was submitted with really low or no transaction fees, but the merchant can see that right away, well unless they are really new to bitcoin and don’t understand it.  Most merchants who take it are setup by a third party that helps set them up and also helps them decide how much bitcoin they want and how much they want to convert to whatever currency they want.  
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:44:45
Yeah that’s valid.  I’m right there with you because I’m new to crypto and got in when all the Chinese shit was going down so crazy swings were my intro.   Put some cash in some alt coins if you want some more shit to look at.  Something is always moving.

You don’t have to keep it on the exchange but you can’t get as much btc back from the btc future token you split to.  I don’t think you understand what bitfinex is offering.  They let you split your btc to two tokens representing the two future chains.  One for the existing btc chain, one for the Segwit2x chain.  If you do this, then dump your Segwit2x coin, you then have btc future which you can convert back to btc but it will be less btc because btc future is trading around 80% of current btc value.  The risk is if you do decide to keep it on the exchange as either of the split tokens, if either chain turns out to be worthless, you could be stuck with the chain you choose and get pretty fucked.  Safest thing is to pull your btc off exchanges and wait it out.  If you want to gamble split to the two tokens and pick your side.  It might pay off pretty large for some but on the other side a lot of people might lose a lot of money.  It’s a huge game and we are fucking tadpoles so you might want to stay out of the water.

Ok so for the attacker to profit they basically need to get people to send them s2x bitcoin and hope they have not spent the associated btc.  Or the other way around.  Then they can copy the transaction and replay it on the other network.  For the attacker to simply burn coin they just need to replay transactions and see which go through.  So basically anyone who wants to mess with the other chain can just spam transactions.   And if this goes through malicious users can just replay any transactions where they receive something on the other chain?  Hoping for a hit from a user who doesn’t care about the other chain or is unaware of it.  Sounds pretty fucked up.  Is this the first time this sort of thing has been a real concern for bitcoin?  If not I’m surprised we haven’t had some shitcoin do this in the past and scam people.

Fun stuff.  I ran core full for a week or two when I first got into crypto.  I kind of want to do the satellite thing to have a copy of the whole chain cause it’s a cool project.

Bitcoin gold is horseshit.  Man I don’t know how they managed to make people think it is anything other than scammy garbage.

I think you are perfectly fine if all you have done is bought.  Just keep a record of purchase price and how much each time you buy.  If you hold on for a year the tax will be less, I think.  I am going to have all sorts of fun figuring out how much I owe.  Bitcoin.tax is a good site to help with this when you do actually cash out and have to report it.
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:20:06
Yep, someone put that order there.

Ledgers are going for about the same.  I’ve just used trezor so far and like it, but the Nano stores more coins.  Both are good options.
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:18:59
You certain?  Then put the house in bitcoin.  By fizzle I mean it gradually loses market cap and interest and most people cash out into other things.  It could happen while corporations adopt blockchain and leave crypto out in the cold.  For crypto to go from here will require more people to get in and care about it or institutional level investment.  It appears more people are getting into it but that will hit a threshold eventually.  Serious institutional investment has not really happened yet.  It’s up in the air.  If it was an absolute slam dunk it wouldn’t be as volatile as it is.

Well not exactly. Banks could have their own private blockchains.  One thing I come back to is most of the utility of bitcoin does not relate to the price.  If anything higher price and more transactions decreases utility in a lot of ways.  Explosive growth cannot last forever.  Most of us here are betting pretty large on the idea that the space will expand greatly over the next 3, 5, 10 years and it will be very profitable.  It has been true in the past so it must hold true for the future right?  I’m not certain.  There will come a time when lots of people lose lots of money.  I think we are in growth phase too but it’s hard to deny it has been at a stupid fast rate this year and we might be due for serious correction.

If you really believe this you should dump all your btc into bt1 on bitfinex and enjoy a nice return.

Yeah first I think a lot of people in crypto are not familiar with Wall Street.  Also crypto is super speculative compared to stocks behind companies actually making money.  Most crypto is unproven and it is very difficult to match the value of a particular crypto to the very fundamental basic utility of being able to transmit value between two people and that can be accomplished with any crypto.  So where does the value from increasing the price come from?  You can move more assets at once.  Also useful but that is negated simply based on buying more of a cheaper and faster coin with less transaction fees.  Ability to liquidate to fiat is a pain in the ass across the board.  Ether and bitcoin are the most liquid so have an edge in that it doesn’t require a double swap.  Monero is more private so it has an edge in that regard.  The other cryptos are speculation on a very new industry and most will fall flat on their face with time.  So it makes for a crazy market.  I think it’s a decent bet long term but hell if I really know.  It could go back into incubation for years, drop a lot in value, and regulation could clamp down.  Do governments really want to relinquish control of money?  Do financial institutions and banks and exchanges want to have their control fade away.  I doubt it.  They will fight and in the end people will decide through numbers.  Do we really want universal currency so we can back whatever we believe in instead of being tied to our local currency?  Do we want to manage store of wealth or pass it off to banks like we have for a long time.  I don’t know.  So far speculation has made a lot of people rich, but we may be hitting a wall where adoption and education are not driving it forward.

Yep.  When the fork happens any value in any addresses in both chains will still be there on both chains.  Just don’t make any transactions until there is consensus on the best course of action.  Read up on replay attacks if you want to learn why it could be dangerous to send any bitcoin or s2x bitcoin right after the fork.
@_date: 2017-09-26 17:46:12
What is the one you are talking about?  
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:00:34
If you just want some bitcoin easy yes.  I wouldn’t leave it on the exchange though.
@_date: 2017-10-05 12:44:53
How doesn’t it just tank?  Who is buying it?
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:34:24
Ouch.  When you quit you don’t remember if you have made any bitcoin?  I’m assuming you didn’t because 50 should have looked like something.  
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:45:30
I think all these guys just can’t understand why people want something like bitcoin.  We want it because we want a level playing ground.  Banks, governments, institutions have had a serious advantage for a long time.  They want to leverage our assets instead of earn our trust in them.  They have fucked it up again and again.  Something new, decentralized, proven secure sounds good to a lot of people.  The world is simply ready for a universal currency and it is currently absolutely crushing the value of any fiat.  The real test comes when they try to ban it.  Will people give up or will they say fuck off and keep it alive.  It is an interesting time for damn sure.
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:07:06
I’m amazed they have not yet.  Digital gold reads like a movie.

“Hold on despite loss” is my favorite acronym 
@_date: 2017-09-24 18:45:02
Guess you won’t buy from overstock either.  Companies do this because they don’t want the risk.  It’s a bridge.
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:07:30
I don’t recommend touching that garbage until a while after it starts.
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:18:29
I absolutely sold the top.  I also sold sold some when my stake more than doubled which was way before the top.  I also sold on the way back down and have hardly any bitcoin left.  When an investment you make has spectacular returns in a short timeframe it is smart to bring some back and not expect it to keep going up at that exponential rate.  You don’t have to sell it all, just sell some.  It improves your cost basis and you can still ride the upside.  Likewise if something starts dumping but is still above your cost basis you can sell some.  Each time we had a large bounce I sold some.  If I had just held I would still be up but no where near what I pulled off with this simple strategy.  If you want to just be a hodler that is cool but there are definitely different strategies that can work out too.  I’m playing very safe from here.  I only grab a small stake if we seriously dump.  We hit 6100 I’m buying.

I’m assuming you are thinking maybe one day one Satoshi equals 1 cent.  If your math is right that meant btc needs to 192x from its current price to get there.  I’m saying that will not happen in the next 20 years.  But if it does I will chop off my own dick and eat it on national television.  What are you confused about?  I thought I was pretty clear.
@_date: 2018-04-02 04:44:04
Yes, we could years and years away from that.
@_date: 2018-04-02 04:04:46
I will never forget some interview with this asshat where is he said bcash will absolutely overtake bitcoin.  Not a matter of if, but when.  He also said roger ver is always right.  Came across as a dick.  I have to admit it was pretty satisfying dumping 4K Bcash when that mess hit gdax.  Never touched that garbage afterwords and I never plan on owning any ever again.  
@_date: 2018-04-05 09:06:25
Very interesting piece of history,  thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2018-04-05 09:12:51
So we are dumping to around 2.5k to hit that bottom line.  Good to know. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:38:46
I don’t try to predict this, I just stick to my plan.  I buy a little when it dumps hard and sell some if it pumps hard.  I also hold a little bit, but just holding doesn’t work for me and neither does going all in at any price.  I’d rather buy low and sell high.  Another way to think of it is balancing.  Bitcoin dumps a bunch it is probably irrationally low.  If it jumps a lot it is probably irrationally high.  Pretty simple.  No one can predict this.
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:23:11
The cows are all the dumbasses buying overpriced crypto and just hodling it instead of dumping on greater fools.  John is dumping slowly.

Very cool.  I'm running it on a beast of a pc for fun but might setup something like this.  I like the idea of having a full node running all the time.
