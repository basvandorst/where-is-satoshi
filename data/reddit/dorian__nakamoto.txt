Yes it's definitely that Jaap-Henk guy gotta be.

Agreed.  Then we do lunch.

Rather than being a dick you could help further the research and help the cause with something more akin to "ok we've ruled out a consistent attack vector, now perhaps we should look into the prospect of staggered attacks."
As a Canadian I'd expect you'd have better manners.

No.  I was eating lunch at the time.
@_date: 2014-03-08 05:03:38
No.  I'm gonna go make a sandwich now but no, just no.
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:45:00
Yeah about that...

How does that work?  Seems you could easily get scammed if the displayed price is different than the actually price.  I'm sure there will be a confirmation of sorts but if you just moved the decimal point over 1 from the displayed price many people wouldn't notice.

Do you disagree with my assessment?
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:38:46
Stay the fuck out of my garage.
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:38:48
Expensive.  Cost me my anonymity.

Christ Flynn, there's more to life than breakfast.  Like lunch.

Time for lunch gotta go.  choo ^choo ^^choo ^^^choo

My bad.  They called right in the middle of lunch.
