Yes what happens if they can't accept or make payouts in USD anymore?
@_date: 2011-06-13 01:16:42
5MB per year is almost nothing. The chain is like a quarter GB at the moment?
@_date: 2011-06-16 08:39:48
This is what the real market is like too. That line at $20 is called 'resistance'.

I foresee a lot of cheap second-hand hardware on ebay soon...
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:16:02
Oh but it DID happen last week, that time is was a CSRF attack. You forgot already?
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:06:09
Ah yes I remember the Bitcoin7 one now, you are right.
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:33:04
No it doesn't work like that. Either you know how to secure a site or you don't. Clearly MtGox have no clue. The hackers will just wait for everyone to get back into Gox and then bust though another hole they discovered weeks ago.
@_date: 2011-06-21 22:42:32
Not working yo!
@_date: 2011-07-25 07:53:51
That's not what that article says.
@_date: 2011-07-25 08:46:57
Aaron is merely pointing out that the paper D-WAVE wrote only uses an 8 qubit device, which is much smaller than their commercial 128 qubit device. They have not written any scientific papers based on their 128 qubit system. That doesn't mean their 128 qubit device is bullshit.
@_date: 2011-07-13 07:51:29
They inspect EVERY package. Stuff that looks like legal prescription drugs are often let through though. Not so much with obviously illegal stuff.

My password was very long and included both numbers and letters. I used different computers and my home connection is not a static IP. My username is REDACTED if you want to check it out. I also proved that I own the email address connected to that account and I also submitted proof that I knew the amounts and dates of all my deposits.
@_date: 2011-07-25 07:19:31
The D-Wave computer has 128 qubits. 
@_date: 2011-07-06 08:42:03
Yea but gold is shiny

@_date: 2011-06-19 22:14:03
You better not come crying to us when MtGox get hacked again next week.
@_date: 2011-06-25 01:00:41
I sent some more info (last account balance) just 3 hours ago approximately. 
@_date: 2011-07-03 07:46:14
Hackers, spammers, carders, etc.
@_date: 2011-06-24 22:55:53
Fuck you for rejecting my request TWICE. Do I have to fly to Japan and smack you in the face to get my BTC? I had an impossibly long password and I was in the 'salted hash' group so I very much doubt anyone else submitted a claim to my account with the correct password. WHAT THE FUCK??
@_date: 2011-06-25 10:31:13
Yes thanks
@_date: 2011-06-20 08:20:43
I'll use em until they get hacked more frequently than MtGox.
@_date: 2011-06-20 07:07:09
That's just as fucking stupid. They gave the ENTIRE database to some retarded idiot? What the fuck Magic the Gathering online exchange! WHAT THE FUCK!
@_date: 2011-06-20 06:00:09
Have fun losing your bitcoin when it happens again next week.
@_date: 2011-08-02 09:37:26
HAHA people are still using MtGox
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:09:44
Fuck MtGox. Anyone going back to them after this is an idiot and deserves to get hacked.
@_date: 2011-06-18 07:39:36
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:39:09
I'm switching to TradeHill or something, I'll certainly never use MtGox for anything ever again.
@_date: 2011-06-21 22:41:39
Why? We're just logging in to withdraw everything.
@_date: 2011-06-16 08:31:53
They can seize US bank accounts which could be devastating.
@_date: 2011-06-17 08:46:49
Want a bj?
@_date: 2011-06-16 08:41:44
lol online gambling
@_date: 2011-06-13 03:37:48
Yes but Americans won't like making international bank transfers just to get some BTC, the fees would kill you.
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:43:44
MtGox got busted twice in a week. None of the others have ever been hacked. 
So we KNOW for a fact that MtGox is vulnerable. The others MIGHT be but so far they look good. And you want to stick with MtGox? How can you think like that?
@_date: 2011-06-17 08:52:13
100 Satoshis = 1 μ฿
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:21:07
Cause last week many people lost money with their cross-site request forgery bullshit and today hackers busted down the entire database through method unknown. Clearly MtGox are incompetent and this will not change any time soon.
@_date: 2011-06-20 22:17:07
I know they've been hacked fewer times than Magic the Gathering online exchange.
@_date: 2011-06-20 07:11:30
Who decided to give the entire fucking database to some 'auditor'? Fire that person immediately.
@_date: 2011-07-13 07:52:44
The Bitcoin Killer Application. This is why Bitcoin will always have value.
@_date: 2011-06-16 08:47:06
In fact there are 1U servers that will fit 4GPUs (although in this one they're nvidia cards...) 
@_date: 2011-06-27 08:34:27
That's ok we like donuts
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:41:20
Just so you know, man-in-the-middle attacks are extremely rare in the wild. There's almost zero chance that this was a MITM attack.
@_date: 2011-06-13 22:07:58
Yes so if you only wanted $100 in BTC it's not worth it.
@_date: 2011-06-21 03:42:31
Have fun getting hacked again next week on MtGox. If you can even access your account by then.
@_date: 2011-06-15 10:31:08
