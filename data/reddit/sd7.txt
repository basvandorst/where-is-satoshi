It's good to see your face again!

Too be honest I see their point the is misleading redirecting it to BitcoinCash.com would be a better move.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:05:48
Its a fact without Bitcoin.com there is no point trying to build a company on that domain because you just won’t be found in search and it will create confusion. The domain gains no organic traffic.
The only people this is useful too are are Bitcoin.com or maybe a hobby site.
Before calling me clueless please backup why it’s worth so much I’ve been doing this 20 years.
I just took the domain and put it into a company to appraise it for a laugh and I was wrong.
It’s worth just over 10k and that seems high maybe because they list it having an Alexa traffic rank when the traffic rank for that domain is zero.
It's not worth Millions it would be better for someone with Millions do buy domains like circle.com, gemini.com etc and that's what they're doing because they are getting correct advice.
Bitcoin.com is worth millions Bitcoins.com is worth around 10k it gains no traffic.

You could use it to cover news. if you care about Bitcoin don't sell it to Roger Ver. If I had control of it I would just point it to bitcoin.org if I'm honest.

Well, this aged well holy shit lol!
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:33:44
I believe in Bitcoin but there is no way it’s hitting 1 million as it stands Bitcoin is a mess from my point of view. I’ve had to drop support for it at my company because the delays and fees are too high now and I know a handful of others who have suspended or ended Bitcoin support. I’ve been in and following bitcoin since early 2012 right now it’s more of a price cult than wanting to grow it IMHO.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:08:55
Millions? are you high? I work in this industry I can tell you it's not even worth 10k for a start it gets no traffic whatsoever 
And the search term 'Bitcoins' is so oversaturated it will never rank in Google. all that domain is good for is redirecting typo traffic 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:31:03
That was so well researched and done 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:58:42
It said
BREAKING: Korean govt will regulate bitcoin exchanges but not ban them. Exchanges will have 6 reasonable requirements on KYC/AML, key storage, separation of fiat into 3rd party accounts, consumer warnings abt trading, transparency of orderbook. GOOD NEWS!

Just so you guys know this is making bcash and Bitcoin look bad someone today asked me about this story and they think its Bitcoin not bcash the issue here is most people don't understand bcash and Bitcoin are not the samething this is making Bitcoin itself look bad.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:19:05
Shame I had to drop support for it due to fees and delays for payments to clear :(

Every device has its flaws but a JB iPhone opens up a whole world of hurt if you install tweaks that could have bad code. Your risk of installing a bad tweak is very high vs getting a bad app off the App Store. Also keeping in mind your phone also won't be patched at all.

What's funny about this is that it's not really a problem right now web masters just accept it but in the end sites will just force you to unblock or pay wall the site off. The open internet as we know it will be dead within 10 years.

This is how BitPay runs their company and has done from day one my company processors all Bitcoin transactions via them and we had no issues handing over paperwork to get a higher limit.
If your one of those people that must remain anon for whatever reason BitPay is not for you.  
@_date: 2015-07-20 03:20:47
Not sure why you're being down voted but keep up the good work!
@_date: 2015-07-18 04:35:12
Where are you based?
@_date: 2015-08-03 04:15:10
Speaking for my business we're one of the biggest gaming and news websites on the Internet and our type of visitors they're mostly tech minded so we never had to really shout that we accepted Bitcoin those who knew about it use it but here's advice I can give you from my dealings.
Online processing we use BitPay because it's a simple API, it's user friendly and they don't add on fees.
BitPay allows you to pick the % you want to keep in Bitcoin (if any) we keep it all in BTC.
The biggest problems I've seen are people keeping BTC in online wallets, BitPay clears out your balance each day to wherever you want but wherever it's going make sure to use multi-sig.
One of the screw ups we made was our lack of understanding of the double spend risk we made people wait for too many confirms early on but quickly lowered this.
From a business stand point reward people for spending BTC with you by giving them discounts purely because you have no chargeback risk or fees vs processing credit cards where we find 1 in 200 of our transactions end in charge backs.
@_date: 2015-07-07 04:56:09
Very nice! It looks very professional glad it's a meme free zone!
@_date: 2015-08-03 12:55:50
I work discount on the credit card processing fees we pay so if we lose $0.95 off each one that is taken off the price for Bitcoin payers and then we add another small discount for lack of chargeback risk but that's based on our overall %
If you've asked BitPay to up the limit it will automatically go up if you get anywhere near your limit so don't worry you won't hit your max as the same thing happened with us.
If you have any other questions let me know I have no problems helping.
@_date: 2015-07-25 14:34:32
That is really cool!
@_date: 2015-07-31 03:27:18

@_date: 2015-07-21 04:16:23
If all your Bitcoin stuff is on Linux and you use windows and become compromised Linux is still no good to you for the most part because windows can access its file system depending on how you have it setup.

I was just ranting about the current community here and it’s price cult mind set glad I’m not alone.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:50:48
But it’s not FUD it’s very real, you’re also over looking the tether issue this sub really needs to pull its head out of its ass sometimes Bitcoin had lost 9k off its price before the ban talk even started. Bitcoins biggest battle is getting each business to accept it again after the price hype is gone we will be left with a coin that you cannot spend anywhere. Bitcoin as it stands is being used by people as a store of value or to get rich quick that can’t last forever the community around it today is about the price and getting rich the community before was about getting a business to accept it now no one cares it’s really sad.

Whatever he, she or their reasons were for leaving the person/persons clearly does not want the credit/fame satoshi will go down in history as putting together something so important  the ability for everyone to be banked freely. Maybe not being around is the point were missing Bitcoin is to be faceless bound to nobody/company and I feel if satoshi was around the media would just focus on satoshi and his reasons not the technology thank you satoshi!

People can do what they want but Adblock is just pushing the internet towards a payment wall.

To the moon guy where are you!?
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:07:53
He won't be able to show proof because I'm the creator of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-29 18:13:50
Is there an est on how many bitcoins have been burnt?
@_date: 2016-05-05 04:59:40
What a find! I wonder how he will talk himself out of this one?
@_date: 2016-05-05 15:06:34
At this point he can't make himself anymore of a laughing stock 
@_date: 2016-05-29 04:08:13
My price alert went off came back to put on my seatbelt and enjoy the ride

With LBC make sure you have ID and stuff ready as sellers are very careful of new account  holders you will find getting $200 right away will be hard and you will need to do a few smaller trades to earn trust.

I'm not going to say your real name because I'd be banned from this sub but I've spent an hour looking into you. Whats bullshit is using a fake office address trying to make out your a real UK company.
You are NOT in the London King's Cross Office block. You are NOT registered with companies house you're simply a scammer.
No real company would reply 'Really Bullshit' you're clearly upset you've been busted before you even started.

God damn the Bitcoin community just can't catch a break!
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:14:57
OP I own one of the biggest gaming forums online and added Bitcoin due to reading this subreddit what I've found is make Bitcoin cheaper you don't have to pay the 0.33-0.57 transaction fees and accepting Bitcoin regardless of sales is important to have as it shows as a business you're willing to move with the times. Bitcoin does not rival our other methods (yet) but with a discount we get sales each month.

I'm wondering the same you.
@_date: 2016-05-05 16:29:27
Still makes me laugh he got a free lunch out of the news team to tell them the inside story and the story was they had the wrong guy. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 23:43:51
Not sure why you have so many negative comments nor why this was upvoted so much but welcome to the club anyways if you want any advice don't store coins in online wallets it's not worth the risk 
@_date: 2016-07-03 22:22:25
But Litecoins cap is 84 Million not 21 :/
@_date: 2015-02-15 17:05:52
And the fact most of these banks and ATMs still use Windows XP o_O
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:52:16
Left in the rocket :O
@_date: 2016-07-09 15:58:55
The website is totally dead so hopefully the steamer does not refresh.
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:48:56
After all that's happened today, I saw the title read the 1st line and raged, I then read the 2nd and died laughing I can't handle this emotional roller coaster.
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:51:23
Happy Halving :D
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:35:32
It they're willing to pay 700+ to have the person/persons  hunted down you would think they would have enough extra to give to those who have lost due to this "hack"
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:53:42
Happy halving :D was good to watch it roll over again.
@_date: 2018-12-25 05:24:26
If you don’t care about an 80% loss than I’d worry about yourself.
@_date: 2018-12-16 15:48:35
You are not the 1st and you won’t be the last you.
@_date: 2016-07-09 20:29:39
I think he landed safely on the moon :D
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:45:52
Just saw Craig Wright on the news saying he's not doing this for fame he just wants people to leave him alone. Lets just say he's real he created this for himself this whole thing smells bad.
