How about no?

Sounds like someone is jelly.

It still needs to be processed in the blockchain by miners and needs multiple confirmations. It'll still take time.

More details please. 
How did you fund it? Dwolla? Bank Transfer? They still need ID verification for international bank deposits and Dwolla. 
Are we talking this Wednesday just passed? Because that's like half a working week. That's not that long.
Also, they're working flat out to try and ID verify 14,000 new users along with getting DDOS'd to shit, bitchy customers regarding lag etc. 
Give them a break.

There was about 8min of lag on MtGox.

It went to commercial straight after the interview. The commercial was for Bank of America.

I've used BitInnovate. They're pretty swift. You deposit at an ASB branch and they send you BTC (based on a fixed rate when you ordered) within a few hours. If you time it right, the price is lower than MtGox even including the commission.
I've heard that volume is low at bitNZ and the buyers aren't meeting the market price.

Stop [spamming]( you twat.
If you're really that impatient, jump on the MtGox irc.
@_date: 2013-04-08 07:29:26
Nope. There was a [3BTC tip]( in the millionaire thread.

With over 5min of lag, any order placed now is gambling on what the price will be in 5 minutes. 
Some might sell below market value, some might purchase above market value (or obviously the reverse).

This sounds legit, guys.
Don't play with money you cant afford to lose.
@_date: 2013-04-15 08:57:07
Nope no verification process. Just a $1000 limit. Your order is valid for four hours at a locked in price. In the morning place an order, then make a cash deposit at ASB within four hours. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 01:35:52
Please, would you all stop trying to break the systems?
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:32:57
I put in $1500USD a couple of weeks back. Got $2800USD out of it. 
Currently playing day trader with some of it.
@_date: 2013-04-15 08:32:52
What's the point doing it now? Banks are closed. 
Wait until the morning and lock in your rate.

No they don't.
