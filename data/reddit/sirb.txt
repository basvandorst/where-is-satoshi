Some news about this:
(Posted by Simon Hausdorf on 18 April 2014 04:36 PM)
Dear Folks,
we would like to say, that the new website has nothing to do with the old website.
Patrick will set up an link to the old marketplace next week, so that the old customers can access the old account.
If you would like to use the new Bitcoin-24 you need to set up an new accoun.
Cheers and happy easter
@_date: 2014-04-19 09:25:57
Interesting. They still owe a lot of users Euro and BTC balances, and it seems the old accounts do not work on the new website.
@_date: 2014-08-21 21:52:44
Thanks for the clear answer. My main concern was indeed that the facebook account right now seems to be the 'main' identification. Which is a no go for me personally, as I deliberately use a retarded password for my Facebook account.
I have no problem with using Facebook as a tool, just not as identification.
@_date: 2014-08-21 19:10:34
I'd rather not use my facebook account for serious things like money.

Take a look at the various sites offering graphs of the most important exchanges. They all have up to date and high resolution data, which will immediately answer your questions.
E.g. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 17:17:12
Because just writing down the name of the customer is more convenient?
@_date: 2016-11-17 17:42:40
Oh you were serious ... Yes of course the merchant is taking risks. But so is he by relying on new technologies, having to buy hardware, having to spend time on learning a technology that might disappear ...
Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of crypto, but mainly when used in scenario's that make sense and do not increase overhead instead of lowering it.
@_date: 2012-12-03 14:11:40
There is a difference in value imo. In your scenario, the bitcoins I buy today are obviously worth more in the future. I can buy more with them. 
@_date: 2012-12-15 15:19:55
All right! 
@_date: 2012-12-12 08:57:35
Well thanks :)

The top answer: chaos ensues, other stuff to worry about. If power really can't be restored we might have to resort to some ancient commodity trading system, true. But really, that's the stuff TV series are made of.

If you are really concerned about privacy, get yourself a miner. It is unlikely you will have any decent ROI but you will have super clean coins.
@_date: 2013-10-04 20:18:33
That is indeed the ultimate solution, although extremely complex when dealing with dynamic websites.
@_date: 2013-01-02 12:53:25
I would not recommend BTC as an investment. I think it is likely that the exchange rate will crash a few more times. There are way too many bitcoins just sitting in wallets compared to the amount of bitcoins used for real payments. If bitcoin progresses smoothly to a decent currency, bitcoins are for sure one the best investments you could pick today. But the risk of another crash is too high imo. I have about 100 EUR in bitcoins myself, just for have some fun on betsofbitcoin etc, but that's it.

Getting started and FAQ on the right will provide a better and quicker answer than the responses you will get in this thread. If you've got some specific questions, shoot.

In every transaction, the inputs are actually previous transactions. At first sight it would seem obvious to simply use addresses as inputs (as you more or less suggest in your question), but that's apparently not how it works. I guess there are some very good reasons to use transaction outputs as inputs instead of just address balances. A first one that comes to mind is simplicity: when checking a transaction, it is way easier to check whether an output has already been spent or not than to calculate the unspent balance of an address.
@_date: 2013-02-18 18:09:05
I don't get it. The tips get sent to an adress managed by the website, website splits tip between the girl and the boss/hoster/whatever. That's probably also how it works with a credit card.
@_date: 2013-09-25 20:13:26
It's not that much money either :) I can't be bothered with it right now, when kraken and btc central get back up to speed I might start trading again. Also, still need to get some money back from btc-24 ...
@_date: 2013-02-12 16:21:43
That is possible but unlikely, as the alternative network would be very small compared to the current network. They would have a hard time getting their bitcoins accepted, which are actually a different currency than our bitcoins. In practice, I would say no. This might be an interesting read for you:  Note: Litecoin is more like brother to bitcoin, while a parallel network is more like a twin.
@_date: 2013-04-01 21:26:45
My first guess is that there is some error in this transaction that is not detected by blockchain.info. We'll find out eventually.

Higher liquidity desired, people holding on to their coins ... bankers love this stuff :) "I'll hold them for you and even give you intrest!" Seems very  logical actually, intrest free money will never exist imo.

The biggest problem right now isn't deflation, it's simply the fact that the exchange rate fluctuates way too much. It is simply annoying for both customers and retailers, but I do not expect the exchange rate to stabilize a lot in the next few months ...
About deflation: imo, as long as the deflation rate is around 1 or 2 procent, it is not an issue. If a customer wants some consumer good which can be bought without getting a loan, he will simply buy it. I really don't want to wait to buy my new guitar because I will be able to get it 2 % cheaper if I wait one year.
For goods that require a loan: in case of deflation, a low and stable deflation rate is really required. It will result in hoarders lending their money at pretty low rates, as they will get it back in most cases (which is their goal because they hoard) and they get a small reward on top. Note that this gets difficult when deflation is around 5 % (annually) or higher, as the borrower will have major difficulties paying back the loan, because own income will get lower over time (in BTC, not in purchasing power).
Bottom line: the exchange rate has to stabilize, deflation should be below some threshold which makes lending in bitcoin possible.
Disclaimer, this is just me thinking about economics without having an education in it. My thinking might be flawed :)
@_date: 2013-01-22 19:18:58
Very interested, would be really cool if you did it!
@_date: 2013-02-25 22:31:58
It's all kinda related: more transactions means bigger blocks, which means:
 * more storage required
 * new blocks take longer to download
 * new full client users get frustrated
I think limiting the block size is the only way to convince miners (and users) to prefer light transactions. But right now that will not have an impact, as the block reward is way higher than the transaction fees. The average transaction will have to include a 10 times higher fee to match the block reward at 1 MB (aka full) blocks. Satoshidice will not like that :)
BTW: the storage problem of the whole blockchain might be a non issue, as there is some tree pruning system that could be implemented, if I get it corectly.
What do you mean by 'the sorting of transactions'?
@_date: 2013-01-22 13:25:28
I doubt that is the main factor driving up the price. Bitcoin is just getting more and more exposure. The bad thing is that it is mainly attracting people who are speculating, while the actual bitcoin economy still hasn't really taken off. My fear is that there will be another crash, destroying its small and vulnerable economy with it. =&gt; We need to get some real economy going asap.

Linux kernel was indeed developed as a solo project, for his own needs. He would have been perfectly happy of no one would use his kernel although he posted it on a newsgroup. Bitcoin is worth exactly nothing if no one else uses it. Big difference. It is designed to be used by a lot of people, if not, it is a big failure.
@_date: 2013-04-20 08:45:42
Matonis does write fanboy-style articles from time to time and I also saw a piece with Ver on mainstream media that made him look like a fanatic politician instead of a fundamental bitcoin supporter. I can understand this decision.

Is this mining mentioning (with the vector art graphics) video still around? It shouldn't be, it confuses the hell out of new users.

Every single thing he wrote back then that I read is still true, it is amazing how foreseeing that guy was. He is certainly a highly skilled systems designer and developer.

This is probably a good place to start:

Try to avoid it. If it is hardware related, you might be generating incorrect hashes. You can put it like this: if the hardware is too hot to properly render your screen, it is probably also too hot to calculate hashes correctly.

IMO it is not very useful to think about the downsides of this kind of ICT services. If those services would eventually prove useful to criminals, they would emerge anyway, with or without opposition. ICT is too efficient and cheap not to use for criminals. The best option is then to create an implementation that can be useful for everyone. Any form of control or lack of freedom will always lead to an alternative implementation, defeating the goal of opposing the technology.

I never saw a strong link between random personal facts about someone on the internet and online banking safety. Same for bitcoin. As long as your passwords are unrelated to your favourite booze etc there is not really a problem.
@_date: 2013-02-12 16:15:06
Yes. And the bitcoin economy could continue in theory. The lower supply of bitcoins can be fixed by adding extra decimal places in the software. At that point the people who are trying to catch 'm all will realize their attempt is futile. Still, it would be annoying as it would destabilize the price. (assuming there will be a stable price in the future, I really hope so)
@_date: 2013-02-16 20:39:19
I recall some redditor talking about this one or two days ago, apperently he was serious about making it himself if it really is that guy. Kinda quick though.
@_date: 2013-01-28 09:10:48
First of all, do not explain mining. It will confuse 'normal' people.
Second, get a scenario. I like the 'Hi, I'm a dollar/bitcoin' idea. Show people that the dollars you pay with your credit card at starbucks get shaved a bit by visa/... and are only then passed on to the vendor. Same for online transactions. Show 'm that bitcoins are free: nobody has the right to tell you what to do with it. (cf paypal, visa, ... blocking certain vendors). Just ehm, do not mention stuff like silk road. They can find out on their own if they want to :)
Focus on: it's YOUR money. Dollars are still some kind of state property I think?
And to conclude, I think we should be honest about how much you can do today with bitcoins. Mostly an encouraging end, motivate people to spread the word etc. I'm at work so that'll be it for now.
@_date: 2013-02-25 19:14:42
Yes. Bigger blocks put more load on the network. While that is not per se a disaster, there should be an incentive to keep blocks reasonably sized. Right now there is enough space in the blocks, as a consequence stuff like satoshidice piggy backs on the blockchain and the networks resources. This is all still possible because the block rewards are high and the network load is low. If bitcoin were to take off for real, some incentive for efficient transactions is desirable. Putting *some* limit on the block size will certainly help. Building extra layers on top of the blockchain to avoid high transaction fees will also help, a lot.
@_date: 2013-09-25 17:05:09
If people would want to get out, they'd do it now. It is extremely retarded to wait for the big dump if you want to get rid of your coins. I guess most of 'm are just holding. I personally paid way less for my coins than the current rate, which is the reason why I would not even care if it would crash.
@_date: 2013-02-20 13:59:55
Mining is too technical. Start with: it is a new currency, including a special payment network which is very cheap to use. No central bank or government has anything to say about bitcoin. It is still very new and it might become mainstream somewhere this or next year. That's about everything a non technical user should know.
If still interested, you can talk about exchanges. If still interested, you can talk about the different clients/web wallets. If STILL interested, you can start about crypto and mining.
@_date: 2013-01-02 14:48:41
I get that, but the upper bound is right now far from something that has practical consequences, as there is so much BTC sitting in pockets, that any movement (read: cashing out) of those bitcoins would have the practical effect of a government printing extra bills, causing trouble. This fact is (right now) much more important than the hard limit of 21M. I hope that this will change in one or two years, but I fear it won't, as I suspect that there are personal some wallets holding a shitload of BTC, which basically enables them to control the exchange rate by a large margin.
@_date: 2013-03-26 08:22:17
The economy hugely depends on electricity and communication. Companies, factories, governments simply assume that these two services will not fail. In case of failure, they are the first things (maybe after water supply) that will get fixed. Sure, during a total blackout you can still pay with gold, you can't with bitcoin. But no one will do that. People will rather just wait until the basics get restored. The gap between blackout and restoration would likely be covered by physical cash and simple I owe you notes.

For most users it is a big issue. They aren't used to initial setup times of several days. I personally have my wallet on a virtual machine at work which I can access through a VPN. Once again, not exactly a mainstream solution :)

Make sure you have the latest version. It is a couple of times faster than the pre 0.8 versions. You could also download the blockchain somewhere else (torrent, ...) such that the client just needs to verify it, not download. If you have a fast CPU, just verifying is much faster than downloading from other bitcoin nodes + verifying.
