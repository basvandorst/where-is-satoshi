Now that's what I call consumer protection. Bitstamp is using BitGo too so they're probably next. We should boycott exchanges that don't offer Proof of Reserve.

The problem with recommending that noobs use BitcoinQT is that they usually aren't expecting to have to wait a week or two for the blockchain to sync. We want people to run full nodes, but it's not for casual users unless they understand the commitment they're making.

Bitter much? Didn't Moolah "accidentally" fund like 50% of the nascar by himself? And didn't he use dogecoin stolen from his own userbase to do that? Is he even in jail yet?
I'm just going to guess that nobody is interested in a bitcoin nascar because nobody is interested in nascar.

Excellent point. 21 Inc's entire business model is pushing decentralization. If they thought BIP 101 would result in greater decentralization, they would probably vote for it, but that's not the case.

Some of the hydroelectric dams in China actually generate more energy than they can possibly use, especially during down hours. They have to either store that energy or lose a ton of money. So they mine cryptocurrency onsite which converts that energy directly into money, which they can store more easily than cheaply than raw electricity. You can think of it as a battery if that helps.

It's just not that simple. Increasing the blocksize is a linear solution to an exponential problem. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 14:30:44
Of course, but what does that have to do with this lie that core devs don't want to scale bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-09-20 13:31:08
Where do you get the idea that core devs didn't want to scale bitcoin in the first place? That's absurdly false. Of course they want to scale bitcoin but they want to do it the right way.

Who? Even LukeJr understands the block size limit will need to increase eventually to allow for a payment layer. He doesn't think it's necessary yet and is taking a smarter approach than just increasing block size indefinitely.

@_date: 2015-09-15 08:30:56
It's really neat so far. Pointing to your own full node is excellent for privacy compared to Electrum where you never know whose server you'll get. 
I still need to play with it some more to figure out the complexities. I don't see anything about hardware wallet support like HW.1 and Trezor though. If it had that, I would be more eager to switch.

Weren't you just repressing your critics on GitHub the other day?

I said that increasing the blocksize is a linear solution to an exponential problem. In other words, it's not nearly enough to scale bitcoin by itself.

BitcoinJ is great, but it's a lie to say he's contributed more than almost anyone else. I'm not alleging anything. It's all spelled out clear as day for anyone who isn't blindfolded. What's your problem?

I understand there would be turbulence in the markets if banks increased interest rates, but I don't get why the entire economy would collapse if they raised it a tiny bit.

I would turn it off for a couple hours.
@_date: 2015-11-19 17:12:34
Aside from BitcoinJ, his contributions have been minor. He developed BitcoinJ before he was being courted by bankers, so it's pretty obvious where his allegiances lie at this point.

Think of Peter like a penetration tester. Someone who alerts you to all the different ways that your platform is exploitable. Without a critical eye for vulnerabilities, they would never be fixed. Peter's insights are crucial for helping make bitcoin more resilient against attackers. We should listen to him more carefully instead of crying about Bitcoin's vulnerabilities. Speaking of breaking things, what have you done to improve things, and why are you so interested in breaking network consensus?

Yes, money supply has 'increased', but it's not exactly 'in circulation' since they're just sitting on it. If all that money started flowing into the economy, prices would start increasing because of all that new money circulating.

Doesn't it work both ways? I.e. it will also make it harder for the BTC price to fall because upward pressure is also amplified? This sounds like a great market equalizer to me, but traders and bots will indeed need to adapt.
@_date: 2015-10-16 23:59:51
There's no reason to believe the block size is increasing exponentially, so the use of a logarithmic axis is flawed. How about a linear version?

It has *everything* to do with the shitposts by XT puppets who refuse to think for themselves. The *only* reason this thread is at the top of is because people finally seeing Mike Hearn for what he is: an arrogant, manipulative, obstinate distraction from actually improving bitcoin. 
And as soon as people start seeing Mike Hearn for what he truly is, all of a sudden it's time to stop the dog piling. This is all a case of XT puppets dishing it out relentlessly and being unable to take their own medicine.
