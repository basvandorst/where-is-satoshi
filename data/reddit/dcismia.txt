Socialism is not roads, police, firemen etc. Socialism is collective control over the **means of production**. Roads produce nothing, police produce nothing, firemen produce nothing.
Words have meanings.learn their definitions before attempting to use them.

M2 includes the monetary base. Your $4 trillion figure is a subset of my $14 trillion figure. 
**You need to understand the difference between money supply and monetary base.** The monetary base increased by 500% because the Fed purchased trillions worth of mortgage securities from the open market, and placed these securities on their balance sheets. You will notice your chart showed the monetary base decreasing very recently. that's the effect of the Fed selling these mortgage securities (MBS).
This will help you understand. I know, economics is difficult, but you can do it.

If you had actually read this, you would have seen this gem:
**Accordingly, any currency backed by any sort of value became a circulating medium of exchange.**
You seem to believe the one currency can cause another to hyperinflate. Gold never weakened the dollar. Gold's price merely **reflected** the relative weakness of the dollar.
Unless the US money supply increases by 10,000% or more with no corresponding increase in real GDP, then the dollar will not hyperinflate. 
You entire premise is based on the dollar spontaneously hyperinflating. Currencies don't do that.

Bitcoin won't "force" the money supply to increase by 100,000%, 10,000%, or even 1%. You are ascribing magical powers to bitcoin by pretending that it can cause the US money supply to increase. Bitcoin can't cause hyperinflation in the dollar.
