Hey all, as of this week a new campaign I've helped launched  accepts bitcoin:  :) We're 100% transparent:

This is a Robocoin ATM, but - yes - the local company has said they'll reconfigure it to perhaps be less invasive.

Is it bullshit?
BTW, should mention: that's four scans of one hand, as opposed to one of each of your four hands.

Hi - I'm the editor-in-chief -- a big thank you for the kind flurry of Bitcoin donations we've seen today! Sorry our BitPay system is a bit crap - I'm no expert in these things, but hope to have something better, and a crypto address, posted up soon after these protests settle.

Comical. I'd also like to see the source. Speaking as Tom Grundy.

Sorry! I know it's horrible... when I can get my head around this, after the protests settle, we'll fix it.

We've just added a QR quote to the page, if that's more convenient! Cheers.

Tom from HKFP here -- THANK YOU to everyone who has donated Bitcoin over the past 24-hours. We raised over US$3000 already. This is an incredible help to our team at this busy time.

Tom from HKFP here. BitPay haven't suspended us - we suspended them... as in, we disabled their donation interface on our website. We're waiting to get our cash withdrawn, then we'll switch to another platform.
