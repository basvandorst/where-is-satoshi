That have had funds sent to them...
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:01:46
They're gonna be mad when it crashes after the fork.
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:36:43
And if people lose faith in it, it could spell disaster for the US.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:24:22
+1 for big short reference
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:35:47
China has been buying up gold like crazy.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:24:22
+1 for big short reference
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:36:52
Bitcoin, how low can you go.
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:23:59
Vertcoin ftw
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:21:17
Why the forced hardfork?
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:42:45
The benefit of LN is not through single transactions though.
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:40:50
Fair play. Keeping it diverse.
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:24:38
Yeah the transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:55:52
Indeed there is :) 
@_date: 2017-09-22 23:59:01
And Vertcoin (VTC).
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:14:02
You could try a bitcoin ATM.
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:37:40
Ikr, LN reduces the number of transactions needed to be committed to the main chain.
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:54:59
Of course bitcoin is gonna dip
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:44:31
Same here, for sure.
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:58:40
Lol what hashing algorithm for the whitepaper?
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:38:28
It is a troll coin and is negligibly low.
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:07:22
This is why everyone needs to understand the fundamentals of money as debt and fractional reserve banking so that we don't make the same mistake repeated throughout history.
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:11:57
I did actually but I bought only the finest; vertcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:15:40
Cheaper than ATMs as it stands
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:08:42
I love how the system designed to prevent bank runs can't even prevent bank runs with its designated reserves.
@_date: 2017-09-04 08:26:14
Nice hashpower.
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:13:24
Wow, that is more ATMs than the number that already exist 0_o
@_date: 2017-09-04 08:21:47
The owner needs to pay for the machine and a subscription to the supplier's service it uses.
@_date: 2017-10-17 08:42:27
If only the fees weren't so expensive....
@_date: 2017-10-07 17:11:21
When I mean zero I mean negligibly low. There are most definitely overpriced alts, not to mention ICOs.
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:33:08
Rule 2 dude
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:19:51
KYC laws are pretty standard. You're very unlikely to find an exchange that won't ask for ID when doing bank transfers/card payments. There are alternatives, one would be to withdraw your money from a bank ATM and buy bitcoin at a bitcoin ATM that doesn't require ID.

"Dere were never any miners in China okhayy no miners heeeere, have gud day sir tank u"
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:23:37
The first image isn't even a disruption.
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:45:07
Lightning network could not come fast enough.
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:49:13
The transaction fee is probably like half a burrito.
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:50:20
(of a price) much too high; exorbitant: 
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:56:13
No problem dude, all good.
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:25:23
The fees are extortionate and confirmation times unacceptable for point of sale. Hopefully the lightning network comes around fast.
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:39:26
In terms of all the alt coins, there is an element of truth here. A lot of alt coins could go to zero just like in the tech bubble.
@_date: 2017-09-03 04:36:27
Thank you. I was looking for this earlier today.
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:20:45
Indeed just look at the QE to stock market trend. Like two peas in a pod.
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:08:38
Looks like they are already trying.
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:33:33
Won't this give them a competitive edge/speed up the process.
