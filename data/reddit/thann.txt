How is that entitlement? 
If somebody says: "Hey come use my free service" then turns around and starts charging, that's pretty dickish...
Am I not entitled to think liars are dicks?
@_date: 2018-01-30 04:36:22
You need to chill and and have some perspective.


Open source licences *literally* entitles everyone to the product for free forever. So yes I'm asking for those entitlements. And nearly all of the software I use entitles me to all of that too. So what I'm suggesting to OP, is that if he wants to compete with other similar apps that grant those entitlements, and open his app up to a wider audience, he should open-source it.  I'm not trying to beg for something, I'm trying to help OP.
If he is trying to build a business out of this app and doesn't want free help from the community, and has some crazy wonderful proprietary UI features he's trying to keep secret, that's fine too, but he's going to have a harder time.
What's wrong with entitlement sometimes? How would you feel if you lost your rights from citizenship? Open source software is an entitlement I'm proud to have.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:23:43
Trust is hard to come by, especially for something as important as money. Any security concious person would refuse to use proprietary software, so you could greatly increase your user-base by opening up the source.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:00:25
What? It's already "free as in beer", I just also want it to be "free and in freedom"
And he would do it, so that his users would not have to trust him, and consequently reach a larger audience.  Also other devs would be able to contribute. 
Literally the only reason *not* to open-source would so that to could vender-lock-in his users and start charging them, but that would be very dickish. This is another large reason why some people refuse to use proprietary software, and another reason why he would get more users if he open-sourced it.

No, no, you have it backwards. You should be asking "why am I paying less than $100 to transfer bitcoin?"

Good news for terrorists like yourself, Coinbase just started supporting BCH =]

If GDAX had a leg to stand on, I'd agree \^.^

I'm pretty sure you have to pay a TX fee when you open AND close a LN channel =]
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:45:13
BTC tx fee: $30
BCH tx fee: $0.5
IDK if this is an attack =/
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:00:20
No, I'm pretty sure coordination is required for an attack.
Lots of random people independently deciding to buy something is not an attack, it's the zeitgeist.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:10:19
Yup, and just because the price is dropping doesn't mean it's an attack.
I'm just saying there are a lot of variables in play here. =]

It's pretty obviously intentional, and they claimed it was accidental
@_date: 2017-04-06 01:29:33


Plans to release whitepaper on how to enable ASICBOOST and prove this this claim?
@_date: 2017-04-06 05:53:28
Thats the conspiracy theory anyway, we'll see how Jihan reacts to EB+main-chainSW 
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:15:54
Uhh, actually attracting new developers with fancy press releases is pretty helpful for open source projects, and literally every single one the creator worked on an idea in a small group, and then, wait for it... Publicly​ disclosed their project to the masses.
@_date: 2017-04-07 04:16:45
It doesn't look like that will take long based on how simple the change is. 
and yeah, we still need to figure out what, if anything, to do about overt boosting.
@_date: 2019-12-03 17:25:39
Only works if youre a business
@_date: 2017-04-04 09:14:03
Segwit only really makes more space for the witness data, extension blocks are segwit AND a blocksize increase.
And someone should whip up a PR to make a BIP, but it's more important to scrutinize and test the proposal right now =]
@_date: 2017-04-04 09:05:40
Have you literally never heard of a press release?
@_date: 2017-04-25 05:33:09
I'm pretty sure ExBlock wallets can interact seamlessly with Legacy wallets... 
Why do you think otherwise? 
@_date: 2017-04-06 21:17:03
Definitely a lizard person
@_date: 2017-04-06 05:39:54
EBlocks include segwit though
@_date: 2017-04-06 06:03:19
Yup, only time will tell =]
@_date: 2017-04-20 10:46:06
For sure, it's hard to tell what's happening when slander and conspiracy theories are the only​ things getting upvoted around here =]
@_date: 2017-04-07 04:10:16
Uhh, it was *two* words... clearly tweet worthy!
But seriously, he resolved the Asicboost issue, and it was really simple.  Don't be hatin' =]
@_date: 2017-04-06 21:22:14
The problem is when it becomes political, if a party wants to hold back enhancements like segwit for their own gain, it creates a schism.  That's what Gmax is purporting, but Jihan doesn't appear to be against ExBlock enhancements that stop covert ASICBOOST, so its still just a theory.
@_date: 2017-04-07 04:58:02
You're certain Jihan will pull support? Or disagree with my logic? =]
@_date: 2017-04-06 05:50:05
They said they'd move to main-chain segwit if necessary but EBlocks seem to block ASICBOOST as is 
@_date: 2019-04-28 18:04:13
They just needed to scan the code and it would have put in the price for them =\
@_date: 2017-04-04 16:51:07
Soft forks are axiomatically better that hard forks
@_date: 2017-04-25 06:50:08
Wow! I see, thanks for explaining. This reorg edge-case does seem quite problematic. Hopefully someone thinks of a clean soft-fork solution.
@_date: 2017-04-04 08:41:47
Nobody wants a hard fork. Now that there is a soft block-size increase solution and the miners have jumped ship, I think support is waning quickly. 
For the other two points, he's either dumb or malicious =]
@_date: 2017-04-06 21:09:59
ExBlocks might already defeat covert asicboost, and if not, the bcoin team is open to moving segwit to the main chain. Jihan doesn't appear to have objected to that.
@_date: 2017-04-19 06:54:27
It's a proposal to add the ability for miners to decide as a group what the acceptable size of blocks should be, as a solution to the issue of blocks being too small. 
But the idea is very hard to do and has a lot of bad side effects. Additionally it's implementation is far from production ready.
Since it requires a hard fork to deploy, its basically impossible to get enough people on board, so other soft-fork solutions like Extension Blocks are much preferred.
@_date: 2017-04-06 03:41:18
Releasing the asicboost hack source would be devastating to Jihan, and help us fight back against miner activation. I'm surprised he hasn't done it yet.
@_date: 2017-04-07 04:51:51
ExBlocks now prevent covert ASICBOOST, so unless Bitmain pulls support for ExBlocks the revelation is just FUD  =\

That was simpler than I expected \^.^
@_date: 2017-04-06 05:59:02
Coming from a single anonymous source, doesn't exactly preclude it from being a conspiracy theory =P
@_date: 2019-09-11 16:50:10
If only there was some way to exchange and store value without relying on a centralized third party ��
@_date: 2017-05-31 04:40:29
Coinbase needs to get their shit together.
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:23:37
Well right now the proposal is for segwit to go in as a soft fork basically identically to UASF ...
And the hard fork is just a simple block-size increase, so IDK how UASF and barry's proposal are any different regarding ASICBOOST
@_date: 2017-05-31 04:49:13
It appears to have been fixed.
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:00:16
How does UASF stop ASICBOOST exactly?
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:28:41
1. If this were true, wouldn't the sw2mb HF also stop it?
2. From what I understand, segwit only reduces the efficiency of covert ASICBOOST by half, but even still it saves around 2B rounds of hashing, so its not really stopped by segwit.  
@_date: 2019-05-15 00:10:29
I'm assuming he used purse.io
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:22:38
yeah, exactly, extension blocks is essentially a sidechain scaling solution, but it requires support for resolution txs for it to work. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:32:10
I believe it's just random.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:47:45
sounds like someone's jelly
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:50:19
Just the incompetent MSM pretending to be relevant.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:38:14
I see, thanks. I guess "sidechains in general" can be anything almost. 
But I still don't see them as a scaling solution because they cant really increase the rate of general purpose transactions, but rather for making a "complex transaction" take up less space on the mainchain. (which sounds almost as good, unless most transactions are simple) =/
@_date: 2017-06-07 06:08:46
Sorry, allow me to clarify, what certainty would we have that 45% of the time we win? Is there some neutral third party like random.org or generation from the latest block I'd?
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:06:04
CNBC is just stupid; they also made and article today about AMD stock going up because people were buying their graphics cards to mine /facepalm 
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:23:10
That's correct, but 10 mins is the *average* time, sometimes it takes an hour to find the next block and that's whats happening right now. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:18:06
How is the "betting" feature not a scam?
@_date: 2017-06-30 19:02:57
... unless they're free as in freedom
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:20:09
No, they're fundamentally different; side chains require trusting a third-party.
You have to send your funds to a third-party and trust they don't steal/loose them (just like a bank w/o FDIC). It seems to me sidechains are only good for internal use, multisig-escrow wallets or lighting are useful when you don't trust the other party.
