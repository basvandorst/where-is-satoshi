Paper tissue on wet sticky surfaces is clearly subpar. A washable piece of cloth is clearly superior, though I guess plebs wouldn't know.

How's he going to mine altcoins/fall asleep to Gianna mandhandling male talents?
@_date: 2018-01-14 08:13:34
Hope you can turn off the tower lights, or else don't mind sleeping like a jerk.
Congrats anyways :).
Edit: Just noticed a roll of toilet paper. Atleast if you sleep like a jerk, there's no reason not to jerk off, right? ��

Yes, my dude. It went through after waiting some more. Thank you again for your reassurance.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:52:57
I fully agree.
Roger is a ploughing goat cunt and Falkvinge the gonnorheic nodule on the rancid clitoral hood that is Bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:29:41
Thank you, dear.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:16:05
Yes, it just took a while longer than I was used to. You are very kind to have reassured me, not to mention check up on me. This is an awesome community. Thank you very much :).
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:47:54
Good point. No they have not.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:33:27
Thanks, my dude.
Is this common?

To be called taint doctor you must have studied to become a doctor or just be a taint adventuring fan of doctor who, in which case, you have my lukewarm respect.

Still though, it doesn't usually take this long, but I guess high traffic also has something to do with it. Thank you for your help.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:31:12
Hehe, relax. 
Don't panic.
Never trade anything when emotionally compromised.
Things will get better.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:53:05
Thanks for your insight =).
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:38:34
Thanks. It's news for me.

A new type of shilling in I like it, where can I buy your coin, sir?
@_date: 2018-09-01 11:33:58
Don't get me wrong, BTC is great. The vast computational power to process everything is wasteful, and harmful if done on a much bigger scale.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:27:50
What fire safe did you use?

Still holding.
Still blaming the syphilitic cunt Roger Ver for causing instability.

Someone explained it better than I can. It's about vulnerability to 51% attack.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:20:28
I wouldn't, but I don't know your situation.
I think this is someone (or some people) trying to force smallbies out.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:30:40
How so?
@_date: 2018-09-01 07:20:53
No one seems to take into account the global movement towards combatting worsening climates. Bitcoin, at the moment, works because of wasteful processes.

Lab grown stakes for sure. It's not reasonable, or sustainable, how we are currently managing livestock. Therefore these crypto e-stocks are sure to take over, though I'm sure someone will also try and give me a prime ribbing for making this comment.
Edit: Pff, bunch-a kids. In my day we respected our elders.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:46:22
They have; Balance shows zero, but it says pending with zero confirmations.
@_date: 2018-06-04 13:33:27
What happens then?
Did someone conjure something up whilst constipated on a toilet again?
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:19:30
I've had one of these. The GPM is a wet dream. Ignore the people trying to put you down; This little guy can literally enable you to make more money/invest more in what you want.

In the euro wallet, I am fairly certain that you can.

What other site can a non-US customer add credit/debit cards to?

They seem so small and sketchy, though.
I had hoped for gemini, but they aren't businessing in my country.

If you're so easily convinced, let me tell you about how wikileaks do grunt work for Putin and how Assange only cares about justice when it doesn't involve himself.

Some of us do, but you might just be blind, deaf, and busy with your immediate surroundings.
