This is the most useful information I've gotten yet and actually makes 
a lot of sense. Thank you. Is there a good website he/you use to keep track of daily rise and falls of alt coins?
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:29:43
Appreciate the insight my man 
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:56:52
Thanks, well thanks a depressing &amp; realistic way to end a day of research. Idk how far your know knowledge goes but say I was to get my hands on a Antminer L3+ that mines Litecoin at a hash rate of 504MH/s and hooked it up at my job instead of my house, you still think I wouldn't make some money?
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:10:37
Go on..
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:52:41
Thank you!

Okay so I buy a bunch of alt coins, now what? I just wait for the value to climb?
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:41:00
Mining anything? Even ALT coins? So how do people make money off this shit? they just buy and wait for highs or do they just use it to buy and sell shit?

I accidentally transferred BTC on coinbase to BCC on Bittrex, help! Is there anyway to get my money back? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:21:39
Either way I appreciate the response, thank you. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:14:56
Well I was planning on Mining Ethereum or Litecoin? is that what you ment, also what do you mine?

Thanks for the thorough answer man. I'm buckled in!
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:12:57
That's what I feel like too. It's only 7am in Beijing now and much is to happen during the day that will affect dip

BTC has gone down over $100 since I posted this...Is anytime really good time to buy? Because right now is more of a steal than the hour before it. Patience works both ways friend
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:41:41
And who can we trust..
