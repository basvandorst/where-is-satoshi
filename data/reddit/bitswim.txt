No there's no incentive scheme. I personally just saw this and decided to chime in after giving it a shot. Probably other happy users are making these posts (I only saw 1 in the last few days). I would definitely use them for many other things; its like Gyft but you hold BTC not girftcards, and easy to use.

They let you enter a return wallet address and you can have the balance converted and sent back to you. I got 81 cents back

So If I got paid monthly to a ledger wallet, I could write a program that automatically pays my (rent, phone, isp, whatever) from that wallet without the need to interact with the wallet? Or would I still have to input my pin, etc?
@_date: 2015-01-31 18:55:25
Forgive me if this is a dumb question but could you potentially write software for a hardware wallet as a workaround, or does that also require exposing the keys?
@_date: 2015-05-08 03:29:40
Look at my history, I don't post very often, but saw this and today and decided to chime in with my experience.
Maybe people are actually expressing their delight at something that works simply and does exactly what it says it does without hassle? Doesn't make those people shills.
Also, nobody is forcing you to read anything...

Care to share? A link would be great!

Just another practical example of how Bitcoin saves people money and time while being the most secure payment method. I used it for the first time 2 days ago and it was the smoothest transaction I've ever experienced in person.

If b) cash didn't exist
Bitcoin would be competing to fill the void left by there not being any cash against gold, current global banking system, and some fintech startups. In the US alone, that could be $1-2+ trillion. Globally? 10? I don't know. 
Bitcoin has filled this role relatively well since it began, despite manias / adoption waves / big thefts / etc.
@_date: 2019-08-23 07:22:12
"most likely" because you don't know. You're just a dude, and you don't actually do any of this,.so you don't know. Fine.
Just stop being so arrogant about your ignorance.
@_date: 2019-08-20 11:15:49
It will be around if 1 person still runs the software. It may take a different form, but BTC is far more durable than any paper note
@_date: 2019-08-20 11:14:08
No, i picked it up off some bill collectors I've known for a while who would never have let it go if it were ;)

OP spent all that time whining about something they made up
@_date: 2019-08-23 07:31:29
No difference in usage?
If that's a bad way of saying they are operated similarly, sure.
Bcash has on average less than 1/6 the tx volume and 1/10th the tx value.
Roger Ver is a fart.

Never had a BTC refused because someone couldn't verify it's authenticity. = Fungible
@_date: 2019-08-23 07:33:20
They do

Pretty sure this is in violation of Visa / MC's advertising policy where you can't actually say this kind of stuff, even though it's true.

I'm streaming Hearthstone these days and take bitcoin tips!

The text doesn't say "black people"....go re-read....clearly the text as written is objectively worse than if it had said "black person"..... how do you know? Because nobody is self-censoring the words "black person". 
People have no sense of humor. Okay fine. I'll explain it.

You have just described present-day bitcoin mining.

In case you were wondering
@_date: 2015-07-29 00:48:07
Thanks for the solid suggestions!
I had thought of Mycelium as well but i'm not a big user of it or LBC so hadn't thought of creating the ads at the price. 
I'm honestly asking for someone else, and assuming that their needs would make this a more time-sensitive issue than waiting for a buyer. Also most likely not the most technically inclined (another assumption). I realize the danger of suggesting Bitcoin to someone who isn't technically inclined, wanted to explore options before I brought it up!
Definitely will check out the tigo-money thing too

Been aware of Schiff since 2012, Bitcoin since 2013.
Gold since - -20%
Silver since - -40% or more
Bitcoin since - +3600%
I still own all 3

You're doing Bitcoin wrong if you have enough money with a 3rd party to feel uncomfortable if it gets stolen.

@_date: 2015-04-29 00:51:53
Bitcoin *IS* a digital cash system. So you fortunately never have to hold it with a third party.
Bitcoin is already easier and more comfortable to use than fiat currencies for me. Sending money is as easy as scanning a QR code and typing the amount, or in many cases just scanning the code.
I have no risk of my payment information being stolen and used without my permission. Even an iPhone app is likely more secure than entering your credit card/ login information for each transaction.
@_date: 2015-04-26 08:07:43
You should consider using Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system where you don't need to store your money with third parties.
You're begging to get robbed.
@_date: 2019-05-14 18:34:45
That's excellent to hear. It was good times for me a lifetime ago, playing at mining and connecting to slush for my slice of those YUGE 25 BTC blocks ;)
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:22:17
slush pool....good times
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:49:30
Make your first transaction for a penny. I sent my first mined $10 for my first time and almost had a heart attack waiting for the tx to show up, let alone confirm.
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:16:45
It's mostly a question of privacy - if your address is for personal use and you've done stuff you don't want known, it could be backtraced to you, depending on available information.  
Generally if you spend from an address as well you've exposed the keys, so using a fresh address may be more secure.  
Been a while since I got into this stuff but that was my understanding a couple years ago
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:48:24
As with most things the difficulty is relative and goes down with experience and familiarity.
It's pretty trivial to find a guide to securely generating wallets and actually follow through with it to the point where generating dozens or hundreds of addresses or performing other operations becomes like second nature.
The entire point of this thread is to help people who don't know and have questions. Bitcoin is best experienced, and that includes securing your own funds. Paper wallets are a cool option that serve a variety of needs and shortcuts will be dangerous because people don't understand the technology, in part due to views like this.
Any person with curiosity, determination, or desire can learn just about anything.
@_date: 2016-07-25 14:32:10
You can use mine 
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:19:07
As an alternative to a digital hardware wallet there are options like cryptosteel (not sure of cost) or paper wallets which are virtually free and can be backed up just as easily.
If your'e securing funds, the behavior is different than trading. When trading you largely have to trust third parties even if you're using decentralized exchange (you have to trust that the exchange operates as intended)

A few possibilities:  
\-you got scammed  
\-you're looking at the wrong blockchain  
\-you're looking at the wrong wallet (wrong backup seed / phrase / key)  
\-something else
