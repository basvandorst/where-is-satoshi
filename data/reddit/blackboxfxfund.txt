Bitcoin is ridiculous expensive/slow if you use it for transfers..... just use any bank if you are in Europe... will cost you €0 without any headaches

Bitcoin was born out of the extreme fraud of the financial system under Greenspan and Bernanke.
They used leverage ratcheted up post-Y2K to levels which could only be supported through legislative fiat to wall off capital fleeing the system.
And the response was a group of folks applied the teachings of Austrian Economics and Ludwig von Mises’ Regression Theorem to create a digital asset which became more resistant to fraud the more it was adopted.
The result was Bitcoin.

They have issues with USD transfers... first thing you will see on their site is ‘USD transfer issues update’ on the top.... I did made an EUR transfer last night (SEPA transfer) and the money were in my account in about an hour.... 
DON’T try USD transfers !!!! Doesn’t matter deposit or withdrawals!!!

What about all these derivatives(weapons for mass destruction) which they launch as futures,ETF,Options? Institutionals taking over BTC and that’s a sad story.... big money start to flow in the market and that’s a big danger to the retailers/enthusiasts...
