that's not a problem for me, that isn't the point.
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:11:03
You add some good points. 
If I end up homeless in 5 years, wait 5 more and I may be a millionaire lol
@_date: 2019-08-30 12:30:17
once again, that isn't the point. I have far more self control than most.
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:12:34
seems legit.
@_date: 2019-08-30 12:45:46
I locked some up until midnight last night, can't seem to get them unlocked now...

@_date: 2019-08-29 15:48:14
I do. That's not the point. Dunno, just like the idea of it...
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:06:19
Makes sense. What is a HTLC?
@_date: 2019-08-29 23:23:25
just like the idea of it is all. think what you will

I'm still a reddit noob, how does tipping work?
@_date: 2019-08-29 22:40:47
you're no fun

I'm not talking about locking up all of my holdings, otherwise what you're saying would be a good idea. If it were any other coin I would be concerned about a major protocol change. If there was, it would just airdrop 1:1 anyway. Very possible I'm missing something, but that's why I posted here.

My original thought was to use something like this, but of course the blockchain would be much more secure. 
I make a $5 wallet and surprise myself with it in a couple years this way.

I'm a bit of a noob. are there any tutorials on this? don't want to screw up and lose my bits.
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:55:33
I'm just talking about locking away maybe 5-10% of my holdings. I like your story, my outlook is a bit more romantic though.
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:20:36
Well, Mr Finney isn't around anymore (RIP) so how do we figure this out?
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:51:28
The idea of digitally locking it away within the blockchain just has a bit of novelty for me. I honestly thought there would be more interest in this. what do I know.
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:24:09
The thought did cross my mind. Realistically I would only lock up a small amount for that long. Maybe 10% for 5 years and 5% for 10...

The book/movie would also sell for millions! and I love trash bandits so that's a nice bonus.
@_date: 2019-08-29 16:40:04
read through the thread.
@_date: 2019-08-29 21:01:06
can I send you 10 now and you send back 1,000 in ten years?

I'm testing it now. The timer goes off at midnight so we shall see tomorrow...
@_date: 2019-08-29 20:54:15
I did a 1 year and a five year, $5 each. Nice part about this way is that I'll forget about it. the other way I'll be seeing the private keys in my safe and keep getting reminded. Both are good for different reasons.
