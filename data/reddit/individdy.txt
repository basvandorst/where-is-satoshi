I thought that things have been improved, where instead of generating a bunch of unrelated private keys, you make a master 24-word recovery phrase (lots of entropy), from which you generate multiple private keys where knowing one doesn't allow calculation of the others. So backing up a wallet can be done with pencil and paper (or rock and chisel). Low-tech = reliable.
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:58:53
I think 12 didn't provide sufficient entropy, especially with wallets generating multiple private keys from a single recovery phrase.

It sounds like you basically transfer the funds to a new address ("channel"), one which both parties have some control over, but in a way that prevents one from breaking any agreement. Then both parties privately create signed agreements that allocate the funds between them, e.g. as one buys more coffee. At any time either party can finalize the channel using the most recent signed agreement.

@_date: 2017-12-12 12:07:43
My attempt at an overview of the system:
Bitcoin is a digital currency similar to money in a bank account, rather than physical money like paper bills or metal coins.
Computers maintain an ongoing history of how much Bitcoin is in each account. The history is public so anyone can see how much is in a particular account, though there is no record of who owns which accounts. Only the owner of an account can transfer their Bitcoin to someone else, by supplying its secret key (like a password). A person can have as many accounts as they want, and it costs nothing to create new ones.
Many copies of the history are kept on computers around the world. Updates to the history are done in a way that prevents one of these computers from tampering with it. Tampering and fraud are prevented via cryptography and consensus, rather than trust or authority as is done with banks. Transactions cannot be reversed other than by the recipient giving the funds back.
There is a limit of how many Bitcoins will ever be created. This avoids inflation, which slowly reduces the value of everyone's holdings, what happens with fiat currencies like the US dollar. Nothing backs each Bitcoin, so the market value isn't dependent on anything in some vault somewhere, or some third party promising to redeem Bitcoin for something physical of value. Bitcoin's market value is based on the integrity of the mathematics of the system and the network of computers continuing to exist and operate smoothly.
People who maintain the computers that run Bitcoin get paid by the Bitcoin system, which includes a transaction fee that is determined by the market. So as long as Bitcoin is useful and efficient, it funds the computer network that keeps it running.

The wallet's purpose is to securely send Bitcoin *out* of your wallet, using the private key you supply (via a recovery phrase). It's *not* to securely store your Bitcoin; you do that by keeping your key private and backed up securely. Sending is where your key is vulnerable since the transaction must be signed using the key (everything else does not require your key at all, e.g. checking the balance and receiving Bitcoin). The hardware wallet is able to do this without risk of leaking the key, despite being connected to a computer that's on the Internet (I wouldn't call a hardware wallet an offline wallet).

@_date: 2017-08-25 04:06:48
I think that the Austrian argument is basically that their value will never stabilize because there's nothing actually grounding it. With something like gold, you have the value of the substance for uses related to its physical properties, and the value added by the fact that others are willing to pay more for it. The latter can dissipate, but the former isn't rooted in its use as a store of value.
I agree on the argument that Bitcoin's greatest strength is also is weakness: its value isn't based on any particular thing somewhere, so there's no risk of that thing getting confiscated. I don't see how Bitcoin could ever be based on something inherently valuable, because that would ruin its immunity to relying on some vault somewhere and promise that it can be redeemed and promise that the vault really does contain 100% reserves.

Given that a Bitcoin address private key is 256 bits, isn't a 12-word 4096-dictionary phrase insufficient to fully utilize the key space? An address is 160 bits, so it's not enough to fully utilize that either. It seems that with a 12-word 4096-dictionary system, there will be gaps of keys and addresses that can never be generated. Yes, a wallet can generate multiple keys and addresses, but that leaves 32 bits of address space to fill in, and 128 bits of key space. It seems that best case one would have to generate 4 billion addresses in one's wallet to make use of the full space, assuming that each seed occupies its "own" region. This probably isn't the case.
Is the argument for this simply that it's good enough, despite Bitcoin allowing for more entropy?

Recovery of the wallet with just the 12 words.
A hardware wallet handles the first two with convenience. You can do them with an offline computer that never again touches the Internet, but it's more work and care in not screwing up security.

The term *wallet* is misleading. It doesn't actually store the Bitcoin, just the key needed to transfer Bitcoin *out* of the wallet. You never need to use this key until you want to transfer out; transferring to it or checking the balance does *not* require the key. So if you're hodling, you can lock this key away and not use it for a long time.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:11:38


It doesn't need to. The blockchain ledger records transfers of Bitcoin from one address to another. There is no record of wallets or what addresses "exist"; in essence *every* possible wallet address already exists, just that nobody has the private keys for most of them (this is the crypto bedrock that the system rests on, that you can't figure out the private key knowing just the address). You could transfer Bitcoin to a random address and it would work, though you (and nobody else) would probably ever retrieve it since the private key is unknown. When you create the wallet, you generate a private key and then the corresponding address is mathematically derived.
Since the ledger is public, you only need the address to check the balance or transfer into the wallet. This is great for reducing vulnerability of your cold-storage wallet's private key.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:04:17

It'd be nice if it gave a warning that it was basically doing zero checking of the input and that you should be extra-careful in checking that the destination address matches. Their current "fix" is just a band-aid, because other malformed input will quietly be interpreted as a key.
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:45:45
Wouldn't it reduce the key strength even more to know which of the 2^256 possible keys would be used? It seems that only if the distribution of say Electrum's 2^128-entropy input "matches" that of ECDSA would there be no reduction of ECDSA's strength.
I'm using match loosely here. Consider the problem of scaling an image up by repeating some pixels, then scaling back down using nearest-neighbor pixel selection where you skip some pixels. If the two operations choose the same pixels to expand and then skip, you'll get the original image (analogous to no reduction in strength), whereas if they select different ones, you'll get a funky image missing some original pixels, and with others still repeated (reduction in strength).
Also, addresses are 160 bits (20 bytes), so it seems that a 128-bit initial seed won't generate all possible addresses, and the addresses generated might give information about which wallet software was used to generate it.

Why not? And by deferring getting your item in return, you're allowing others to use the resources in the mean time, which is why deflation actually makes more sense. Getting a little more in return the longer you wait makes sense.


I don't follow this at all. Lenders presumably charge interest. Why would a money holding its value (prices staying the same) deny lenders of any return on their money?


Yes, at least not as a legal tender (in fact, all legal tender laws are destructive in my view). A free market in money would drive out the bad, or at least drive their price down. Checks from banks wouldn't be worth as much as actual dollars, since banks create the money out of thin air (fractional reserve).

Thanks, that's a good way of putting it. If something has intrinsic value, then that value is unchanged by the quantity available. Gold plating of electrical contacts has inherent value regardless of the amount of gold or its market price, whereas gold as a store of value is significantly dependent on the quantity and market price of it.

I take one of the arguments that Bitcoin should be the lowest layer of digital currency, rather than aim to handle both huge transfers and microtransactions. Higher layers can handle the latter more efficiently and cost-effectively, since for one more risks can be taken due to the smaller amounts. Larger blocks is an attempt to have the lowest Bitcoin layer handle everything, even though it can't, for other reasons.

Yes, the [transaction signing I linked to for Electrum]( is an example. My point was that watch-only allows you to reduce your use of the cold-storage computer, which reduces the chance of vulnerability.
When doing a transfer out of an address is recommended to [transfer any remaining balance to a new address]( A wallet should be able to generate multiple addresses for you, all based on the 12-word seed backup you write down in a safe place, so doing this should be trivial. You don't have to create a new wallet. This feature means that you can conveniently use several addresses to transfer funds into, so that if one is ever compromised the others are unaffected.
In Electrum you create the cold storage wallet on the cold machine, get the Master Public Keys, use that on the hot machine to make a watch-only wallet which will automatically know about the multiple addresses available. This key being leaked doesn't compromise your wallet, it just gives access to all the addresses used by it.

I took OP's goal to protect against fire, flood, theft/destruction. If you don't have the passphrase secured, you're susceptible to all of the above (including theft, because if you lose your hardware wallet and lack a passphrase, you lose access, basically like your bitcoin get destroyed). Thus, a wallet doesn't protect against any of these so isn't a solution. (A wallet protects against theft as compared to using another less-secure wallet, but doesn't protect against theft of your passphrase).

When selling something, the seller would like a very high price for the item. When buying something, the buyer would ideally like to get it free. This creates an unsustainable system given that people either buy things for an infinite amount of money and miss out or nothing ever sells and they miss out on a return.

From what I gather, LN basically capitalizes on the fact that lots of people sending money to each other can be summed up as a smaller number of transactions than the individual ones. e.g. if A sends 10 BTC to B, and B sends 10 BTC to C, then only one transaction is needed from A directly to C. As you scale, I gather that the reduction of transactions becomes significant. Also, I gather that there are two sorts of entities on the Bitcoin network, actual transfers of Bitcoin, and tentative requests that can sit around and perhaps never be finalized, and that there's a benefit to having these rather than actual transfers that miners must validate.

So it is efficient in general because people don't all "cashing in", so that the next time they spend it can be from one of these channels rather than from their wallet? But the smart contracts always have a way if anyone gets "cold feet" and wants to get their bitcoin, for them to be able to force finalization.
The video jumping right into channels without an explanation of their purpose reminded me of [this Simpsons scene from way back](

OP said fee's. So the question is, the fee's what? The fee's smallness? The fee's reasonableness?

Trick question; they don't have to know. It works as they understand it abstractly: they have their money, they spend it, the other person gets it. Sometimes things screw up, or someone steals money or there's fraud, and the financial institution fixes it. Bitcoin requires a far greater amount of attention to get the same level of security.

At 2:05 it shows the USD balance, then he swipes over for a second, then back and the balance is already about $700 higher. I'd like to have that much BTC.

Why wouldn't the coins simply be their weight in gold, not some fiat currency?

I saved the $1 bitcointip someone gave me years ago for the hell of it, when I was still avoiding Bitcoin. Now it's worth $4. Wish I'd used that as a nudge to buy more Bitcoin back then.

What if you gave them "a lot" but just a tiny amount, and if they actually ever try to use it, they might contact you and ask why there's so little, *then* you can send them the rest?

I'm skeptical on Bitcoin's store of value, but this author really is grasping at nothing in his argument that Bitcoin isn't real therefore it's useless. Fiat dollars are just printed paper tokens that denote who owns the dollar (which is why governments go after counterfeiters so much, because they make false claims to dollars). They ride on physical ownership and exclusion to enforce that dollar only being held by one person at a time. Some dollars are held electronically, and computers keep track of who owns it. Just like Bitcoin's ledger. So this guy doesn't even understand the basics of the digital age at all.

I watched this for a good ten minutes before I realized why it was posted here, when I found myself yelling "You should have used Bitcoin!"

Why does the author show a price chart instead of a number-of-users graph, to compare with the one for number of Internet users?

The 12-word seed is all you need to get access to all the seeded addresses it creates.

An exchange doesn't have to actually do buys and sells when you initiate them, it just has to adjust your account balances to reflect the action. So they can have lower fees, and pass this savings to you.

Keep significant amounts divided among multiple addresses, and preferably multiple systems, to reduce loss if someone breaks into one.
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:30:46
If you actually use the addresses, you can use any number. The software stops looking for used addresses after it finds 20 unused in a row (or however many you've set the gap limit to), assuming that you never generated more based on that wallet.

The two-factor authentication is to keep others than yourself from getting access via another machine or your machine while you're not there. If the bad guys are *on* your machine, you're unlocking access for them when you authenticate. Your OS must be treated as infested.

Why would a business want to do this in-house and have so many avenues for failure, when they can outsource it to another business with experience, just as they do with credit card processing? "Great, we can now accept Bitcoin, and you take a x%+y cut. Simple."

Why is this something to shit on so much? Sounds like a good idea to take it further in that direction and let reality show which works better. Monoculture is limiting.
