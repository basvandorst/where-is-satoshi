I love his show but I'm not really a fan of Maher himself. I find his monologues to be bland and not very original. When he doesn't get a laugh he just makes fun of the audience and acts like they're stupid for not getting the joke. Also he often spouts wrong information in an extremely confident manner (ex. all developed countries have single payer healthcare - the majority actually don't).
The best segments by far are the panel discussion and overtime, because all the other segments are just Maher alone or interviewing one person.

What if the Farmer simply trades the boy an egg for two lemonades? Is there any tax in that case?

What if the farmer has the boy over for dinner one evening as a thank you for the boy spending a couple of hours fixing the farmer's computer? Are the ingredients of the dinner taxable as income for the boy, as well as the labor that went into the cooking and the computer repair?

I think that means you invested the right amount, when you're conflicted about whether you want it to go up or down. It's like the old thing about how the best deals are when both parties feel ripped off. Scumbag brains.

I'd like way to sell bitcoins but keep the cash in your account (not have it go straight to your bank account). That would make it useful for casual or medium term trading (on days like today for example). Their fees are too high for heavy trading but maybe you just want to sell off some coins but then don't want to wait a week to get them back (if you don't have instant).

You can get verified as instant after your first purchase clears if you also:
1. Verify a credit card (VISA only I believe)
2. Answer some personal questions like the last 4 digits of your social security number, the color/year of your last car and "which out of these 4 people do you know?"

Exactly. It's not like if you have 1 BTC and they start using mBTC you have now been diluted. They're worth 1/1000 but you also have 1000x as much. They're not like Eduardo Saverin's Facebook shares.

The big thing is trustworthiness. Many people don't want to hand over the details they want (account  etc.). If they were Google or Paypal they'd probably do it in a heartbeat.
Also the way they offer to take your online banking username and password and verify that way seemed sketchy. Maybe it's commonplace though, I really don't know.

**Edit:** I actually like Google (look at my name) but I also believe the web would be much better with competition in search engines, video sites, advertising networks, etc. So I would enjoy seeing them dethroned in at least one of these areas by a new scrappy upstart.

Also there's a fee for transferring the bitcoins off, plus conversion losses built in (they round down to the nearest 1000 $SL and whole dollar). So for small amounts they really take a lot. For $50 it adds up to about 33%. For $100 it's like 17%.
Edit: Also for your first transfer it takes 48 hours to get your bitcoins off because you're considered "high risk."

I would think only if all the major fiats go tits up at once. If there's still a Yen / Euro / Dollar then Bitcoin will still be easily transferred to one of those. If all the currencies go at once and Bitcoin still isn't pervasive enough, I don't know what would happen then. It'd probably depend heavily on the reason why that happened in the first place, since it'd certainly be very extraordinary circumstances.

Interesting. Although if they stop giving prime loans because they can't make enough to justify making the loan, couldn't they just give more higher interest loans? Credit card interest can be what, like 20-something percent?
Essentially they could just recalculate their risk based on the opportunity cost of lending the bitcoin out vs. saving it. Everyone would be riskier to lend to (compared to making the 2-3% not lending it) so they could charge these now-classified risky borrowers higher rates. And if more of the wealth is concentrated in fewer hands (the original supposition that started this line of pondering) wouldn't more people be desperate enough to take on more high interest debt, and doing things like starting businesses on their credit cards?

It would be a lot easier to think that way if the future of bitcoin were more certain (i.e. without fears of US government intervention, altcoin fragmentation/inflation). Hell, if its future were certain we'd probably be at 10,000 or more. 
Personally I wouldn't mind losing a chunk of money if I could somehow exchange it for assuring bitcoin's success. I really enjoy using it, and care more about what it means for freedom than the money I'm losing (although admittedly I don't have as much invested as some here).

True, it's like buying something using bitcoin while it's low. Since the prices are really in dollars you're spending more bitcoins to get the same thing.

True, I didn't mean to make it sound like you weren't providing good info. Virwox is the correct answer. I was just a little frustrated when I dealt with them because there were so many little surprises through the process (I counted on there being fees for each conversion, but not all their other little gotchas).
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:45:09


This is the  worry I have about bitcoin's value. Is the maximum number of coins 21 million, or 21 million times N + 1 where N is the number of altcoins? Who knows? It's like having a pile of open source libraries that all do the same thing, but no individual one is widely used enough or developed enough to be very good. The nightmare in my imagination is at the end of the day the takeaway being "look, this is how things degenerate when they aren't centrally controlled." Wouldn't that be sick.

By competition I mean not having 90% market share. For instance right now with the whole YouTube fiasco, content creators have to basically just take it or stop making videos, because even though of course there are small alternatives, there's really no alternative on even the same order of magnitude as YouTube.
