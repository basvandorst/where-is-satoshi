Question from a newbie:
I currently have a paper wallet, would that be an issue if lightning network becomes active?
Would transferring the btc still involve the same process?

Regardless of people saying not to sell.
The feeling of not having to deal with mortgages to provide shelter, is a great thing.
That's 30 years of stress they've saved.
Sounds like a good deal to me.

Just downloaded it.  As a casual observer, its nice to have something simple but has a good overview for the crypto market price.

As an Australian, I almost started crying.

Definitely, I'm new to the crypto game, have some btc, but have been looking at some other coins gaining traction.  This gives me a general overview, without having too much info thrown in my face.

I wouldn't call it small as I think BTC markets is better, but it is convenient.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:20:26

Amateur,  I once saw it drop $2,000 AUD in a minute.
@_date: 2017-09-19 03:32:55
Awesome, appreciate the help.  Just thought it would be a good idea, to offer btc to customers as well, especially since I want to increase my hodlings as well.
@_date: 2017-09-19 03:01:24


Just checked the website.  Is it similar to paypal in the way I have my own unique wallet, which I can then send the btc to my private wallet?
@_date: 2019-09-16 05:58:46
Love the applause at the end.
@_date: 2017-09-19 03:06:21
That's exactly what I meant, sorry still getting the lingo right.  Thanks for the point about privacy, did not think of that.
