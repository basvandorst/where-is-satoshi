Lovely App, easy to use, deposits are immediate, no issues. Thumbs up Circle! works with my debit card here in Ireland.

Yep, got charged 15 cent on a $5 test deposit. Charged by my Bank, not Circle obviously.

The Creators, Developers, and Innovators are why bitcoin will succeed, price is but a very entertaining side show...until the day price no longer matters...that day is moon.

Using Coinbase, this is how it goes:
You deposit $200 today., this takes a few days (3-5 working days) to arrive in your account. You can then decide to purchase btc then for whatever price it is then. or hold off to wait for cheaper price etc.
So, 1btc is $200 on the day you made the transfer, the day your deposit arrives in your Coinbase, btc price has dropped further, it is now 1btc at $100, you can now buy 2btc. No loss.

Great "Song of the Sea" and "Secret of Kells" feeling to the style and character design, fairplay, very nicely done!

You're probably right, but sure, this is pretty much shitposting at this stage.
