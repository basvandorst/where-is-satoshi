But does it scale?

And what can people buy in these enlightened countries?  For how much bitcoins/dollars?

It is the most unaware comment I've seen all week.  "Sure, you know...BIT...COIN?  You can send them back home.  BACK HOME.  To CHINA!  You know...CHINA?"

Premature grey.  He's still in his 40s.
@_date: 2014-12-10 03:04:48
This is worthy.

Oh thank God!  I can by my hides in BC now.  
Bitcoin is taking over.  Today, quality hides.  Tomorrow, the world.

You say 2 million *dollars*, but it's not dollars, it's Bitcoin.  Had goxloser actually tried to exchange his bitcoins to dollars, it would've been nowhere near 2 million dollars.

Ok, what's the exchange rate in Canadian dollars?

Do you people actually put money in Bitcoins?  Or, as I like to call them, Dunning-Krugerrands.  
@_date: 2014-11-06 09:23:56
Uh...no.  If you want to post zingers, [be sure to get your facts straight first](

I thought that could buy a house.
@_date: 2014-05-04 12:33:45
Can't be done.  Bitcoin is a fantasy.
@_date: 2014-06-24 23:42:11
So, when I cash out from Bitcoin to U.S. dollars, how much do I get?  What's the exchange rate?
@_date: 2015-01-15 07:09:56
For your worst enemies?

Hey fellows, this Bitcoin stuff is really having a moment!  It's just a matter of time now!  This is good for Bitcoin!

[I just...I just don't know.](
@_date: 2015-01-14 10:06:12
Putting serious money in bitcoin is fucking stupid.
@_date: 2017-02-12 10:25:50
This will be good for Bitcoin!

Wow.  Some random dweeb said "Bitcoin will unite us" on a livestream and currencies around the world tanked.  Bitcoin rose to ascendancy.  It is the true world currency, and all bathe in its power and glory.
Oh, wait, no.  It's just some dweeb.  You guys really scrape the bottom of the barrel around here, don't you?
@_date: 2015-08-12 02:16:42
YAWN...someone wake me up when someone actually makes money off buttcoin.  You people don't understand these threads any more than normal people.
Feel free, though, to tell how much you've lost.

Because Satoshi Nakamoto is a Japanese name.
