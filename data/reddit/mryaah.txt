and you can already do it... 
but why shouldn't you let google get a cut. They're giving you this incredible hosting platform and the whole idea behind monetizing youtube videos is people pay you to advertise on your video, which google facilitates. I could totally see google allowing the advertisers to pay through bitcoins and that would be great, and you can still put your bitcoin address in the description or the video if you want donations. But video monitization and tips are two different animals.

What is there to stop someone from compromising the original wallet creator and making 4 more cosigners and then use those + the original one to overrule the other 4 people?

I've been using namecheap for a while now and its pretty great. This is just proof of awesomeness in my eyes.

I've tried purchasing coins 3 times in the past 2 weeks. They've rejected everyone of them :) yay coinbase.... what do ._.

Speaking of coinbase, I wish you better luck than I've been having. Coinbase has consistently refused my every attempt to purchase bitcoins and has not responded to any of my emails to ask why. Very annoying.

They have yet to approve a single transaction from me in the last two weeks and have not responded to my support tickets. So im going to go ahead and say they're not perfect yet.

I dont really know how bitcoin wallets work but, if you make a backup, then do some transactions, do you have to remake the backup? if not, why / how does it work?
