tx fees are not dependent on the total value transfered, so calculating a percentage is almost always nonsense.
Complaining about a $7 fee is no nonsense of course, and it's clearly due to the large tx, 19kB 64 inputs... Be your own bank, decide your own inputs... chose your tx size &amp; fee!

OpenBazaar is not a decentralized shop, but it's a decentralized platform. Like a version of ebay, amazon etc.
Vendors share a common platform, searchable via the same interface, using the same moderators on different shops. But this platform is in no way centralized, but the product of all users who take part.

If you want to examine your wallet without syncing (which takes a lot of time and space) you can go via help-&gt;debug-&gt;console and "dumpwallet mywallet.txt". This will create a text file containing all the bitcoin addresses and private keys in this wallet. Do not give this file to anyone!!! Having the private key means having control of the coin.
Now check the public keys (starting with 1) on a block explorer.

You are not very good at trolling. Anyway:
Why would anyone care if he makes money by opening a channel to a bot or to a "real poor person"?
Also, if noone opens a channel to you, and you desperately want to be part of LN: just demand the payment to be made direct an on-chain. Then open Channels as you wish, after receiving $5k your are not poor anymore. Yay!

Sounds like the receiving wallet is a scam/fake. Sadly the appstores are not very good in preventing those. Very happy to hear you found that out by only send a single dollar.
Also check the transactions, where did it move? Did it arrive initially? Maybe it was unconfirmed and got dropped (would be a really bad implementation if it didn't even check if the tx was accepted by the network).

You can also just go there and sneak stuff out. It's called theft, and it's very difficult to get a 100% protection against it in offline shops.

where is the harm in useless channels? besides there is much incentive against that,  layer1 fees,  locked up funds,  which stop bots from doing this. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:28:27
There are certainly cases when no route can be found, in this case routing fails and LN is not a payment option. This can be resolved by people opening channels (either payer or someone else). There are incentives for doing so, as routing entities can charge routing fees. Being the only one able to route might put you in a strong position to charge a lot of those, but the market says if the fees are too high others will jump in to get their share. Yet it might happen that no  one is interested. Sorry for you then :(

lit is not bolt11 compliant,  so won't work with the current ln iirc?
@_date: 2018-09-03 09:02:05
I doubt it, as the watchtower only has encrypted versions of the the TX. you need backups, which are difficult to generate, as you would need them sort of in realtime.
Having switched to eltoo would have helped, as you could broadcast any state as final, and your peers could update the settlement to a more recent version/truth.
This is one of the problems of ln right now, you need proper backups, raid systems etc. I'm hoping for eltoo to arrive soon :)
OP could ask his peers to close the channels on their latest state, but if they figure out that he lost his channel states they might settle to some outdated version (and in this specific case watchtowers would have been helpful) and take the gamble - and first he would have to identify his peers....
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:17:09
If I'm the one to givre 5k to you, I'd gladly open a channel instead of making an direct on-chain tx if you wish so. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:20:20
Besides $5k is quite a chunk for LN right now, someone want's to pay you $5k now. As there is no open channel to you to facilitate this, he might chose to open one to you for this amount, either in a way that the funds are your immediately, or having it followed by $5k worth of LN tx right afterward.

I consider trezor/ledger the most secure way to store a key. You now talk about private key generation, which is not exactly "encrypting some device". I'm sure your seed can be extracted from a trezor by desoldering some flash and reading it out. Please someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I see no way how this could be suppressed. 
Anyway, if you use a bip39 passphrase this would usually/hopefully not be stored on the device and increase security tremendously. But this also sort of answers the question I asked before: "how is this key provided".
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:00:50

Well, I assume it is exploitable - which is not the same as "easily exploitable". To get someones bitcoin stash might justify some extraordinary effort for an attacker.
How can the device be "reasonably secured (encrypted)". This is actually a very hard to answer question. With what key do you encrypt it? How is this key provided at boot time?

@_date: 2018-05-01 08:42:04
Edit: with punishments being possible on a higher level, I have no more concerns.
Your argument works for unidirectional payment channels. But LN is designed to have "merchants" (or any other nodes connected to more than 1 peer) to facilitate payments between those in a network. So eventually many channels will have a most recent state, and different older states favorable by each of the endpoints. I don't see cheating as a problem as of now, as by the attempt to cheat the attacker could lose all his funds, even those which are legitimately his. This is a strong incentive not to even think about cheating.
With eltoo there is no downside to just trying to publish an old settlement, maybe the peers server is down and you win. Worst case is, attacker gets caught and uses the final settlement tx to get what is his anyway.
Considering the many many advantages eltoo offers it might be worth to accept that, but it is a downside none the less. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 17:06:41
I guess you should just open another channel, no need to close the old one.
@_date: 2018-05-06 11:37:01

Okay then, maybe he can give some insight - yet I think this is a puzzle that is not really solvable. One can only increase the work needed to extract information that is on a chip to increase the time the victim has to move his funds with his backup. Or as mentioned above a passphrase.

Somehow I feel it's your fault if you don't have recent backups, but then software should make it reasonably possible to acquire those backups. Also I really like eltoo for it's simplicity, but the thing that it gives incentive (risk: 0, reward: &gt;0) to try to settle on an old state.

Considering that it is not that complicated to implement, I guess he would have just done it if he had thought of it.

As I understand it, this does not allow for a penalty, as the penalty is one of the advantages of the current LN implementation and relies on the asymmetry of information in the current state.

Plase don't connect the value of the tx with its fee. The fee has *nothing* to do with the total value being transferred, just with the size of the tx. You would have payed the same $.27 for moving 1 million (wow, so little fee!!!) or moving 5c (OMG, this is ridiculous, bitcoin is dead!!!11!)
@_date: 2017-02-12 12:57:14
It will be possible, and if you don't watch out you'll spend on both chains simultaneously. If a split happens, there will be measures put in place to prevent that, but they will require an up to date wallet that is aware of this problem. A standard tx would most likely just be valid on both chains.
This happened with the Etherum/EtherumClassic fork.

By having 16 out of 20 words you have knowledge of 192 out of 256 bits. Of the remaining 64bits 8 are checksum, so one who gains access to passphrase plus only one bank vault has the challange of bruteforcing 56 bits. No clue how difficult this actually is, as you still would have to do 2^56 of those expensive derivations with the password...

As you ask for little/no 3rd party: Do it yourself.
Get a wallet, generate an receiving address and post this. Downside: everyone can see how much you received on this.
Enhancement: Get a HD wallet and change the receiving address once you got a donation. Can be done without HD, too.
Whatever way you do, make sure to have the bitcoin address as bitcoin://... format *and* as QR code. For increased security create multisig addresses. Of course keep private keys off the server ;-)
@_date: 2016-01-21 15:56:06
Well, some wallet/market shows you some address, and does not update your balance after you send there. You need to contact the maintainer of the webpage, give the transaction as proof. This has nothing to do with bitcoin, maybe with the website owner not knowing how to handle bitcoin or possibly (don't think so from the info you provided) just setting it up to scam people.
I had that once, too. I was not able to create a receiving address on some platform, so I just resend to the address is used last time. First a few cent to see if it works properly, after seeing it in my online account I send the full amount. One week later I can't be bothered to create a new receiving address and just send again. This new transaction never shows up. Turns out they don't guarantee correct mapping after more than 14 days or something, but seeing my proof of a recent tx they just credit it to me.

I did not say it's wrong what you say, but you display the availability of a debit card that uses bitcoin as if it would suddenly enable people to trade bitcoin.
Wow, I can buy bitcoin and if i want to buy something expensive I can even spend them and thus take profit of the risen bitcoin price! Great news, redefinition of economy! I just imagine the bitcoin was unbelievable high, but I just don't need to buy anything... to bad I am speculating with a debit card instead of exchaning usd/eur/btc like everyone else who wants to speculate does.

Right now they can only make their own blocks smaller. BU enables them to force others to make smaller blocks, too.

Well, right now they don't have the power to change the block size, with BU they would have. Of course you could argue that miners already have the power to do whatever they like by running whatever more-or-less-compatible bitcoin implementation, but by agreeing to BU the whole ecosystem would acknowledge this right and give up on resistance on unwanted changes. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 08:40:24
It's just the safest way of doing things, minimizing the risk of screwing up.
The core client processes the whole ledger from 7 years ago until today. Your transactions are in the very last  few blocks of this ledger, thats why it would take ages using bitcoin core wallt. Electrum uses servers to query the balance of your address, and the servers are already up to date, so that works instantly. Yet beginners might mess up the transfer of the private key from one wallet to the other, thats why some recommend waiting and then using the normal GUI to execute the transaction, in contrary to using some debug console and text commands and to handle with the private keys manually.

That is all valid points, no doubt. But this neither makes OB less of a btc project, nor might it lead to OBs downfall I believe.
- Utilizing bitcoin to enable multisign/escrow in a decentralized and easy way
- Embedding merchant-IDs in the blockchain
- Using proof of burn to gain trust
- Probably something about the decentralized p2p rating system which I don't really understand
Is all things possible due to bitcoin, by using the coin itself and also by using its blockchain technology. So to argue it is not a bitcoin project is just plain silly and result of someone just not liking it because it lacks a few features that might be relevant to one.
For actually working with bitcoin one has to run a server (always on pc) aswell, to keep up with the blockchain. Ofcourse we outsourced that to specialized services in many cases. I believe the same will be done for OB shops - just use your client to connect to one of the servers (not operated by, but shared with you). But anyway, you are just proxying his arguments, he does not reply to mine, so sort of waisted time here ;-)

Sounds great, so instead if the high entropy used in private keys lets reduce that to the simple user/pass which users constantly fail to produce in a secure manner. And if it actually was secure it would either be a painfull process to enter each time, or if saved by the client you would forget it and would need to write it down somewhere (just like backing up the proper entropy mycelium word list). Or you could use your standard password, security ftw. Did i Miss anything?

Some altcoins have real benefits that bitcoin does not offer. But no altcoin, at least in my opinion, has enough benefit to outweight bitcoin as being the first/original and market adoption etc. They are helpful to examin other features like enhances privacy, alternatives to PoW, but no more. Hedging with them is not gonna help, if bitcoin goes down I predict all others going down along.

Congesting the network is quiet expensive right now, 2btc/block currently.
Pools have at least two options of congesting: mining empty blocks or mining their own transactions to make it less obvious and still display nice fees which they are paying to themselves.
The first option is easily spotted, and by congesting with fake tx including proper fee, they risk this fee being taken by other miners. They could of course not broadcast those transactions, so they could mine high-fee, full blocks and effectively just moving bitcoin (fees) from their left to their right pocket, but this would be detectable by monitoring mempool vs. blocks - and from what it looks, this is not happening.

How does this coldstorage work?
If you use electrum for example, you have some disconnected PC and your encrypted keyfiles on some SD-Card in a safe (plus paper printouts for backup). You also have a copy of your electrum that lacks the private key on some connected device. You can see your BTC there, but you can't move them. You can create the transaction, but you cannot sign it due to the lack of priv keys. So you create an unsigned transaction on your online computer, copy that via an usb stick to the offline computer, load/decrypt the wallet, load the unsigned transaction, sign the transaction, copy the signed transaction to your usb stick, transport the usb back to the online computer, load the transaction and broadcast it.
So even while being cold here, you are of course still using some sort of "wallet" to create, sign and broadcast the transaction.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:52:10
The SegWit miners would reject the blocks that are not SegWit and thus would mine their own minority chain. The majority chain would be safer, but the coins would be worthless as they are not accepted by the community/users. But as luke-jr wrote it's not a great idea to rely on UASF alone, but combine it with minervotes to lower the activation threshold to 75%.

In general I think Andreas is a great guy with very very deep understanding of bitcoin and the economics etc., but this did not convince me. Maybe that is the most unconvincing thing I ever heard him say.
Imho miners are scared that no transactions will be left for them to mine because of LN, which is total bullocks. Not activating SegWit stalls the whole network and slows bitcoins progress down. Miners could make way more money charging people to onboard LN.... $10 for a tx to "open a bank account" (lock money away to a payment channel, trustless, instant) is easy to do, paying $10 to transfer some funds is too expensive unless you buy a car or something.

Thanks for your thoughts, I have to admit that your critic sounds very valid. You brought my hopes quiet down :-( 
But back on topic:
Question was "Who is making the Android to Bitcoin's Linux?"
So is Android a Linux project? Because you refuse my answer "OB" as this is not a bitcoin project. Both of our views might have their reasoning, but I must ask you: What makes a project to be a "bitcoin project" in your eyes? Are only accepted BIPs bitcoin projects?
I was interpreting the question in the way "What projects will bring mass adoption of bitcoin forward hugely?". DNMs surely do their part, even if I think they are not the main driver behind bitcoin. And I believed at least (and still have some hope left) that OB will do another good part of this.
@_date: 2016-01-28 16:25:07
I disagree with this article. It's not the least flexible Protocol that wins, it's the most appropriate common denominator that gets chosen.
Slow modem vs. fast modem? If the faster modem *only* supports 14400 and 28800 baud and the slow one 300,600,1200,... and 14400 - how is the 28800 more flexible?
How is it an advantage for the "winner" not to spent resources for options he has not in his protocol? It's his disadvantage, as he has less options for a positive outcome for himself. Okay, the country only using "war" in a conflict might win as "his option" gets chosen in a conflict, but if all you can do in conflicts is to start a war this is sort of an incentive to broaden your protocol.
So as I can neither seethe "win" nor nor the "flexibility" I have to disagree with this article.
@_date: 2016-01-22 17:06:14

You don't really have to care about liquidity or anything. Once you received your LN tx you know that you have been payed. You can settle it any time onto the blockchain and no one can stop you from doing exactly that. Chances are you keep it open to save fees on the next payment, but that is optional.
The LN tx has sort of 6+ confirmations as it is funded by the tx establishing the channel. Establishing the channel takes the funds control out of your peers hands.

@_date: 2017-03-04 12:39:59
The left/right pocket thing was about miners including their own high-fee tx in blocks they mine themselves. This way they would produce full blocks without decrementing the mempool and without losing their high fees (as they mine the blocks, so collect their own fees). They would still miss out on the possible fees of real transactions thou.
@_date: 2017-03-11 14:19:29
As long as you don't move your coins, they are safe. Once you move them, you have to make sure that your tx does not happen on a chain/fork you didn't intend it to happen. I guess a few days after a possible split there will be mechanisms made available to make sure of that, but you'd better do your research then. Just spending coins with outdated wallets is most likely a bad idea.
Also from what was posted here recently, a BU fork might disappear, if the pow on the bitcoin chain becomes greater after a while.

Altcoins come and go.... I'm not worried, it would throw bitcoin back in price a year or so, but we would activate segwit somehow and catch up.
The miners voting is stalling... 7% still voting for 8MB blocks. I don't think this is possibly an active vote, this is "configured something sometime cause it sounded nice and now don't care anymore" - just like all those non-voters. So I don't believe in segwit with supermajority, but mabye 75% + flagday is doable.

@_date: 2017-03-06 16:09:32
I can't see a double-spend either, just unconfirmed tx for a few blocks....
Doublespending is possible, even if the balance on the address is still positive, as you are not "spending from your account" but rather "spend utxo" (unspend transaction outputs). You spend an utxo by signing it with your private key, if you sign the same utxo again it's a doublespend (and it's not a utxo, but a stxo one could argue). Please correct me if I'm wrong, but thats how I understand bitcoin.

Interesting, never thought of that. I absolutely don't see BU reaching 80%, and I'm not scared of a 51% fork - it would die off pretty quickly and miners would return. Anyway to add to your thoughts:
Postivie effects:
- same block frequency for miners staying with the  orignial chain
- slower retargeting, with constantly added hashrate that is positive for miners
- pushing back next halfening by a few weeks
- increased fees for further limited blockspace during retargeting period
- user experience would suck while the miners profit within the first retargeting period, would drive up fees.

@_date: 2017-03-29 12:49:17
As I understand it, UASF will only work if economic majority supports it, hence there is no "activation threshold". If by flag day there is only one pool signaling it and not commitments by economic nodes announced it will fail and split into a super-minority chain and die. If major exchanges, a good share of the miners (&gt;&gt;50% but &lt;95%), wallets etc. signal support it will succeed.

Putting your megawatts where your mouth is... well thats exactly the point. Before activation it does not actually matter. You push some bar in some diagram up or down a few pixels. No real impact. Just maximizing profit. Mining is done for profit mainly, thats why after 14 month of BU availability and 4 month of SegWit availability almost 50% have not signaled either yet. VR payes 10% more than others? What the hell, signal BU... who cares. This has nothing to do with putting MW aligned with mouth. This is maximizing profit.
Okay, so some BU believers and some profit maximizers who in total make up &gt;70% so variance activates BU. Until this point there was no actual choice to make sure you build upon valid blocks. Just now there is! It just appeared in the very moment BU activated. And now what you said will happen - miners will avoid mining upon invalid blocks. Bitcoin might or might not lose value, but certainly it will keep a valid blockchain. BU on the other hand will fork off, and possibly also remain a valid chain - or just drop it and go back to the 1MB blocksize bitcoin chain. So your quoted strong incentive to mine upon valid blocks is a strong incentive to go back to bitcoin, weakening and finally destroying the BU chain.

Anyway, if you managed to get those 0.00042215 bitcoin, they would be on another output, increasing the size of your transaction thus requiring a higher fee. In general it's difficult to obtain the exact amount for  buying something. If you go shopping with fiat you don't think "I need to buy stuff for $4.78" and pack exactly $4.78 - You'll take a tenner and take home $5.22 more or less...

Maybe I'm wrong, but as I see it if the 51% side uses resources to attack the minority chain, they would need 98% of their own resources to build the empty chain as fast as the minority chain, basically stalling their own chain. At 75% they would still need 66% or their power to do that, mining their own chain at only 16.5% or the current speed.

It's "proof of work" not "proof of transactions".
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:44:46
I'm sure that short-term SegWit might harm miners - the last block right now had &gt;3 btc fee, with 12.5 btc block reward that is &gt;20% of the total income. A block size increase would harm them as well, as less competition for block space would lower fees. So I'm sure a lot of miners are happy as it is right now. 
If BU activated there is no guaranteed blocksize increase, miners could also decrease the block size system wide (not just for them selfs like they can do now). So short term incentive once again is small blocks.
Long term looks way different. If bitcoin becomes more useful, it will gain in value hugely, increasing the effective worth of the block reward and fee. I believe one problem here is, that thanks to moore's law mining equipment is sort lived and thus miners are incentivised to care mainly for their short term profit. Unless they also hodl at least.

Well, if you mine, you could mine that way. But in your own intrest, after investing many bitcoin in mining equipment you have to chose: Will you include the tx with the high fee/kb or the one with the low fee/kb? After all the block has only this much space. Economic incentive is of course to include the one with the higer fee.
@_date: 2019-03-19 18:46:57
this is absolutely not bitcoin specific, right?
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:47:05
Compromise is right available, just start signalling segwit already.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:42:55
Well, we know how difficult it is to find a block, like 1 in how many tries yields one block. And we know how often this is happening (bit less than 10min usually). By these two values we can estimate, how much hashrate there is. But as I said it's just an estimate and not the actually deployed hashrate.
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:12:27
And even if... I'm not worried any more. With enough money anyone can buy 75% hashpower and execute the fork claiming miner (super)majority. If users, exchanges, vendors see through it and just don't give a damn about it it turns into the most expensive altcoin launch and no more.
@_date: 2019-03-11 16:41:48

@_date: 2017-03-04 09:18:27
I just checked a random full block and it had 2btc in fees, that is ~14%. If in the next 7 years fees rise by 50% (and I bet they will rise way more) they would already be ~50% of the miners income. 2 more halfings and the block reward will already play a minor role in mining. 
This whole development is also good for the blockchains capacity. Until now miners were eager to find a block at any cost, mining empty blocks based on the block headers just to save a few seconds. With fees going higher and block reward dropping the incentive for that is getting lower.

It's not reasonable to assume that with bitcoin being 10x more expensive that at the same time the tx fee would be 10x higher. The fee is not set in a fixed satoshi/byte, but calculated by demand. It can rise 10x without the bitcoin price moving and and can stay the same while bitcoin rises or falls in price. Many other factors play into this, like blocksize, offchain solutions, smaller transactions, segwit, ....

Why would I give money to someone who says Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme?
@_date: 2017-01-11 08:34:50
Your question is not very clear to me, I'll try answering anyways.
What is a bitcoin stick? I assume it is something (hardware wallet, usb stick) that holds the private keys to some bitcoin. The problem with passing those on is, that the recipient would not know if you still have the same keys on a backup, so it might be duplicated and not "transfered". If by "tracked" you mean if it would be publicly visible on the blockchain that you passed some hardware on to your parents, then it's a clear "no". 
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:19:48

Blatant scam. All articles on the front page are "how to create a passive income of several thousand EUR a month" and "how to get rich trading in your spare time".
But here is a gem from the bitTex article, which I read despite the pain it caused:








So this is where you can buy shares of a GPU miner, not too bad (if this was 2011). But of course they promise 20% return on your investment per month. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:18:15
Once you have that implanted, how will you confirm your tx?
@_date: 2017-01-11 16:33:16
I believe you are wrong. The computer you use to manage your ledger does not have to be trusted. It sends an unsigned tx to the ledger, you review the tx on the ledger (thats why I would not buy one that does not have a screen) and acknowledge it. Then the signed tx is send back to the host computer which broadcasts it. Private keys *never* leave the device. 
Passphrases however might be typed on the computer and thus compromised by a virus, but this is only an additional layer of security that would be breached that way.
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:17:00
If you redeem your BCC you also show that the addresses are connected.... so from the privacy viewpoint i'd not do it for the $20 in BCH.
You can use a mixer that might consolidate it, but considering the amount of coin and expected fee I guess it's just not worth it.

I'm in Vienna for a few days - when will it be open?
@_date: 2017-01-11 11:48:44
That depends on how you do it.
When you set up your first hardware wallet, it will tell you 12 words, the so called seed. You need to write this down and keep it, this is your backup in case of loss, theft or hardware failure. 
So if at a later time you set up a new hardware wallet, you have two options: Initialize it using the stored seed from the first wallet. This will make it a clone of the first, no transaction happening here. Or you could make a fresh wallet of it (also backup the seed) and actually transfer bitcon from the old to the new  wallet. Only the latter will cause a recorded transaction, as no bitcoin moves in the first example.
@_date: 2016-01-24 11:17:14
It might be a cold wallet. It's not like you can't transact with a cold wallet, it just means it is not online. So you sign the tx offline, and broadcast it  from another pc.

No important amount of bitcoin transaction will be taking place by handing hardware tokens from one person to another, as this would imply trust between these two people, while a key feature of bitcoin is that it does not require trust in that way. I could clone the stick before passing it on and spend the bitcoin even before passing it...
Your link to a "bitcoin stick" above references at least:
- hardware wallets 
- standard usb sticks (thumb drive, storage)
- mining hardware
Which are three completely different things, that maybe have a USB interface as a common denominator.

I didn't write the article, so I'm just referring to claims someone else is making.
Yet I deem XSS vulnerabilities way more grave than you do. He claims that there are reflected XSS vulns on the homepage, this can possibly be abused by passing on links to other users.
The main attack vector here is setting up your user account with a stored XSS and then complain to support about "not being able to do stuff". If the technician looks into this, you execute your JS in the context of a privileged admin trying to figure out your fake-problems. Once the payload is persistent and saved in your profile I'd say it's save to assume any admin panel will not filter the output any further.

Well, the average waiting time for the next block, right after one was mined, is 10 minutes, right?
I'm not talking about the time between two blocks, but about the time between the (random) time of you broadcasting your transaction.and the first block that can possibly include it. If you always send your transactions out, right after a fresh new block was mined, then indeed your average waiting time would be 10 minutes. But you might just as well broadcast it just a second before a new block is found and it is included in that. 
Just pick a random time in the past and check how long it took from there to the next block. Repeat this 1000 times and see if you get your 10 minutes.
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:51:14

There are several ways in which trust in the hw wallets is needed, at least the following comes to mind:
* do they leak the private key to an infected PC/host
* is the private key generation done properly (eg non-broken PRNG)
* can the keys be extracted
The first I believe they all have under control more or less, and a proper/trusted PC setup should make you feel even safer.  is an actual issue where no technical solution exists, eventually all hardware will be examined and all keys might be extracted if the found/stolen hw wallet is put under a electron microscope. The defense here is: if you lose control over your device, use the recovery seed/passphrase and move your funds to a fresh address.
For  you can either use coins/dices to select your own seed, which needs to be done properly which might not be as easy as it sounds, or use a proper passphrase. At least ledger and trezor support bip39 with passphrase. The input of the passphrase still poses a security risk, as usually a trusted pc/host is needed for that. Yet overall security should be largely improved by this.

No two miners are trying the same nonce.... or well, maybe the same nonce but they never get the same hash, so their nonce has different meaning, as at least they include one individual tx each, sending shiny new 12.5 bitcoin to their own address.

Well, different for me here in germany. 16€ fee for starters. I just tried to find out how much they steal on the currency conversion, but even when sending to Argentina they only quote the Euro-Value to be picked up there. They also state that they only hand out local currencies for most countries, so it's certainly not being picked up in EUR.... I guess I'd just have to trust them to not rob me.
Or I might just send BTC, prices are quiet high in Argentina anyway, so instead of paying 3% in fees i pay a fixed 20c tx fee and the receiver makes some extra bucks selling it for pesos.

Sorry, but you don't understand what is happening in mining. There is no good or bad nonces. The nonce is just one way to "randomly" modify the input, so that one gets a different output. Any change to the input is equal in the way that one gets another output which might or might not satisfy the difficulty requirement. The same nonce on multiple different tx sets does of course a completely different thing, it just changes to a new hash. No two hashes are ever the same.

Your computer is connected to the interwebs, thus in danger of being compromised. This can allow an attacker to read your files, capture your passphrase and eventually steal your coin. Hardwarewallets are not connected to the internet.
For backups you need to store your 24 word mnemonic in a safe place. Ideally the passphrase in another safe place. Or multiple safe places.

Needing channels to build LN does not make them the same thing. The multitude of channels forms a network, and this is what you want. Your connection from home to your internet service provider is a nice thing, but only the multitude of single paths, forming a complex network, enables the internet as we know it. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 11:27:08
In trusted environment this is of course perfectly fine :)
If you put your keys (seed, wallet.det, ...) onto a thumb drive and lose it, anyone can pick it up and spend your coin. You could encrypt it, but you would decrypt it on your computer. If you catch a virus it might sniff your password, read your private keys from your RAM or what not. 
A hardware wallet (ledger, trezor, keepkey, ...) can also store your private keys, but will not allow anyone to access them. You can not easily export them from the hardware wallet, one would need a high level of skill, plenty of time and an electron microscope to get the actual keys. 
So operating a hardware wallet is very safe. You export some *public* keys to your computer (by plugging it to your PCs/mobiles USB) and use your wallet (mycelium, electrum, ...) to generate the desired transaction. As this software does not have the private keys to actually spend the bitcoin, it will transfer the unsigned transaction to the hardware wallet. The hardware wallet will sign it, and give it back, so that your computer can broadcast it.
To prevent a thief/finder of a lost hardware wallet from doing this, the hardware wallet will require a PIN to operate, several wrong PIN inputs will erase the keys or delay the next possible retry for very long.
In addition to the PIN I recommend using a passphrase. This has the disadvantage that you usually have to input it on the PC, which might be compromised, but it protects your from bad random number generators and lucky PIN guesses and enables a few nice extra features. Compared to not using the passphrase there is no disadvantage besides comfort.

Just by not repeating digits you reduce the keyspace from 9^4 to 9x8x7x6 (4 digit PIN), costing you ~35%. Trezor knows that, and is handling it quite well (giving lower rating for PINs repeating digits), but still... it's a loss.
I see the point of you doing it as you do, and I mention in my conclusion that Trezor is easier to handle - for exactly that reason.

You cannot stop that from happening. Even if you managed to reach consensus on not accepting empty blocks, they could just stuff in a few thousand of their own, certainly not conflicting, transactions to inflate the block and you had not no way of telling the difference between full and fake-full.

I still can't figure out how you deem this a security feature.
It's quiet save against losing it, but thats about it. You still have to worry about hardware defects, so you need a backup anyway.
What do you want to store on this chip? Your seed/privkey that can be accessed via any NFC-Reader? Do you need to authorize yourself to this chip? Normally I'd assume a hw wallet would not give out the key but just sign transactions, but for that a review of the tx is quiet important, how would you do that? 
I think having an NFC implant is quit nice in a nerdy way, but it only makes sense as a form of convenience, say to pay small amounts without having to pull out any device. Thats how the payment card industry is implementing their NFC solutions afaik. 
There was a documentary on german TV earlier this year, they showed a guy with a bitcoin wallet implanted, holds his hand to the vending machine and gets his softdrink. Nice, but if I get my NFC device near his hand I might steal all his BTC, so it's a wallet for change only (hopefully).

Right now at least one of the reasons that mobile wallets cannot receive is that this would create situations in which the other channel endpoint would have an incentive to settle on an old tx. With the mobile being usually offline, this could go unnoticed. Watchtowers fix this. I assume to receive the wallet would have to be online for this moment \- so you would have to start your app for a minute to create the invoice and receive the payment. Not as comfortable as being always on, but in many many scenarios a reasonable trade off.

You clearly don't understand the security model of the lightning network. It has different and possibly weaker assumptions than the base layer, but confirmations are not really a part of this trade off. Confirmations in the base layer are required to prevent double spending. Double spending - distributing the same satoshis twice - is not prevented with "0 conf" or any confirmation technique in lightning, but by giving the victim of the double spend recourse via pre-signed punishment transactions.

Bitcoin that are considered stolen can be withheld by their custodians, whats wrong with that?
@_date: 2019-10-14 09:41:15
as the user can easily get the xpub he can use any derivation path he desires. wallets need to be told which path to check and how many empty addresses are to be ignored in sequence before giving up. 
as a result a hardware wallet does not only have to check that the change address is on a valid derivation, but also that it is within reasonable range.

The reason that we are at 10k is exactly because USD 20M flow into the system every day. It's not like some entity sets the price to 10k and tells people what to do. People decide to be willing to buy/hodl/pump in money and the price is the result.

But you would have to keep multiple recovery phrases secure. In general I suggest you only keep a small amount of bitcoin on your mobile/desktop, like what you would put into your classic wallet in your local currency. Everything beyond this should be saved with special caution. Buy a hardware wallet, think about where to save the 12/24 words, maybe put an additional passphrase on top of that, think about where to store the passphrase. The internet is full of stories of people who forgot their 24 words and passphrases. I'd suggest to use both and not store them together, but store multiple copies of each. (Friends, relatives, bank vaults....)

@_date: 2017-11-28 05:52:08
With modern wallets you always have a recovery seed, this is the 12/24 words. You can add an additional passphrase to that, if you do that you need both: the seed and the passphrase to access your bitcoin. You can have multiple different passphrases on the same seed which results in different wallets. The seed is somehow saved in a wallet, and thus can technically be extracted. As passphrases are normally not saved they can not possibly be extracted. It is cumbersome to use them, but it increases security a lot (If you have a lot of bitcoin I'd say it's woth the effort).

They claim the torrents were not affected, but that certainly is not a feature of torrent, the p2p-community or whatever. He who can change the ISOs/download links can also change the torrent link and seed his own corrupted version. He could not get his versions to those who are already downloading, but even after fixing the webpage, those who started downloading while it was "hacked" might still be on the wrong torrent. Anyway, I hope they are right about what they wrote and the torrents were nevery screwed.

You can send bitcoin to any random address that was not derived from a known private key. Those can never be spent and are considered burned. If you use a simple adress like all-ones with the correct checksum in the end (1111111111111111111114oLvT2) it is clear that it was a burn and no one holds the corresponding private key.
Yet this address can keep receiving from anyone.
Also see OP_HODL - you can forbid the coins to be spend until certain conditions like block-height etc are met.

Thin wallets have no disadvantage compared to full wallets when it comes to how safe your bitcoins are. Both types keep the private keys private, and for bitcoin security that is what counts. Webwallets for example can not really provide this kind of security.
If you talk about security in a wider meaning one could argue that thin wallets are less private - server operators might be able to see which addresses are yours and thus how many bitcoin you hodl. This touches security concerns even if your coins are technically still safe. Another aspect is backup etc, but I hope that *all* wallets more or less force you to create proper backups etc.

This is very true. Just like paypal and visa also work totally smooth if you are fine with centralized services. bcash sacrifices most of what makes bitcoin special (decentralisation, permissionlessnes, censorship resistance, ...) for cheaper transactions. Faster is only true if you don't want to pay higher fees anyways, so sort of connected.

this looks like 40x40 "qr-pixels". That is 1600 bits of information minus maybe 300 for the markers and and maybe 300 for the center piece. Leaves 1000 bits for a 256bit key.
I'm no expert in QR codes, but it would seem to me that it could be trivial to extrapolate the full private key form the part on the coin - or like 80% of it leaving 50 bit for bruteforcing.

First, if the 100GB+ is too much for you have several options, all better than using a webpage:
- Turn on pruning - you will still have to download, but not store the 100GB+.
- Use a light wallet like electrum (desktop) or mycelium (android) or breadwallet (iOS) - only examples/personal preference
If the website disappears, you lose your coin - if you use your own wallet (see above) you and you alone are responsible for your keys. This generally means: write down 12 words and make sure not to lose them.
The address keeps changing to preserver your privacy. Imagine all people would donate to the same address, everyone could see how much you received. You can do this, just use one address and keep it this way, thats your choice.

you are right, but that would be... beyond stupid. In this case *every* mint installation should be considered compromised until keys are changed.

Including this one utxo in the tx would have cost more than just to forget about it.

@_date: 2016-02-03 12:54:35
There are a few possible explanations:
- You connected in cleartext. For me SSL-Everywhere does not prevent the initial cleartext connection to  it's rather the cleartext site that sends me over to https://
- You might have an SSL-CA installed that is not trustable, like due to the Glassfish/Lenovo fuckup (unlikely)
- They might have used a forged certificate after they hacked one of the well known and trusted CAs (*very* unlikely)
Also bitmixer does not use HSTS which puts some blame on them. Using this Header it could a) forbid any returning clients to ever connect in cleartext b) could register to some database to also foce new users to use SSL from their first connection attempt.

@_date: 2019-04-08 11:57:29
To some extend, but not just the same.
Hardware wallets might have security vulnerabilities, but you can mitigate by:
\- not using the manufacturers control software but mycelium/electrum/... in case they do some hidden communication with the hw to reveal secrets
\- use a passphrase in case they use a weak/broken/manipulated PRNG, so they basically know your private keys.
Against the mentioned attack vector with the coin there is not much you can do. Even self-printing this opens up huge attack vectors, as you will transfer the raw key to a variety of different memory devices where it might be recovered from later.

SSL is broken*, but not that broken.
SSLStrip just intercepts your initial HTTP request, and talks to the intended backend via HTTPS - possibly modifying the responses before talking back to you. If you initially type HTTPS://bitmixer.io SSLStrip can't do anything. SSLStrip is basically a tool for a MiM-Attack that helps you to keep the functionality and everything of the backend while sniffing and spoofing to the user, instead of setting up your own fake-bitmixer.io.

As the 12 words contain 4 bits of checksum I guess there will be ~1500 solutions to this puzzle.

This allows the calculations to be executed offline, transfered via usb in a text file and checked without running any code provided by the programmer.

On top of all the other advice: make sure to install your (light) wallet (electrum (pc), mycelium (android), samourai (android)) on a device that is not virus infested, or your coin will be gone before you know. If in doubt, get a hardware wallet (trezor, ledger) but be sure to buy it from a trusted source (vendors webshop).

this is nonsense. you are right, the ca system is bad and broken. yet it does not hurt to use it, and we have nothing better available (okay, signed packages are good stuff, too).
you totally ignored the point of the recent rce in apt. this is exactly what it helps against in so many cases. it raises the bar from random attacker with mitm possibilities (think tor exit node) to state sponsored attacker. Also in any case it helps detecting fraud.  just cause it has flaws does not make it useless. of course it adds privacy, too. it does not give full privacy, but it adds to it.

It's a problem that is not easily solvable. There are passwords that can be hashed, if they are only used for authentication against the system itself. Thats awesome. But you can't do that once you need to derive your private keys from the very password. So you can encrypt it, but everything you need to decrypt is either saved alongside the crypted password or needs to be provided by the user on every use. So we have another two choices: either the user password is trivial (6 digit PIN) or it's not (12 more or less random characters). The first option is worthless, will be bruteforced once an attacker obtains the "crypted" password within minutes. The second is a huge burden on the user, and will lead to lost funds due to forgot passwords at huge scale.

It's not a unsubstantiated promise, it's cryptographically guaranteed. That is a difference. Also while having the channel open you are in possession of all data you need to close it at any time.

This sounds strange. How would a wallet enforce a replay protection if the protocols are identical? Being a miner they could concurrently issue 2 different tx, one on each chain and not publish them before they make it into both blocks.... which can't be done.

If you assume your host gets compromised, this automatically breaks the encryption of your VM. Keyloggers, direct access to the memory once the VM is running etc.
For added security via visualization you need to have a clean host, that does not access the internet itself. On this you can have seperate VMs, one for coldstorage, one for surfing the web. This might add some security, but there have been multiple VM escapes in the recent years, too. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 10:51:45
They all try to get the full block, but at least during the few seconds that pass while you have a new block header but not yet the new block, you can throw your gigahashes at an empty block.
Also as I pointed out before, having minimum tx requirements would only lead to miners faking tx.
Yet the reason I give quite often does not seem to be the reason for empty blocks - as it would only be possibly valid for blocks discovered within seconds of the other block. Yet miners can (for reasons discussed here before) opt to mine empty blocks.
ps: all blocks so far have at least one tx - the coinbase tx giving newly minted coins to the miner.
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:42:17
Why would you want that? I suspect some misconception in this desire...
@_date: 2017-09-27 07:26:19
I did the same, and converted my bcash to bitcoin. Also note that when doing this it's a bad idea to just send all coins to a new wallet/address, as this ruins your privacy pretty much. In electrum you can enable the tab "addresses" and then rightclick/spend one by one, each to a new address on the new wallet or exchange, not publicly linking your addresses.
I guess to make it really unlinked you'd have to wait some time between the sends, especially when your coin was idle for a few years.
@_date: 2017-09-26 17:08:20
But it offers no benefit to directly running electrum on the host... no need for encrypted VMs following your argument. Please also read up on recent VM escapes (March 2017). vmware esx (datacenter version) was not affected, by Workstation versions were.
@_date: 2017-10-03 10:27:43
Very scary, for sure. But better than some of the alternatives.
Pouring endless hashpower into bcash might not happen, if people don't appreciate it - who is going to mine at a loss? I heard people claiming that bitcoin gets it's value because mining is so expensive - but I believe it's the other way around.

2) if you know a new block has been found but don't know which tx it includes yet you won't include any tx in the new block you search to be safe from conflicts.  You can't prevent it - miners could also make up their own fake-tx, noone would benefit.

It's the same for both hardware wallets - you have your recovery seed on paper, in a safe place. Also make sure not to lose your passphrases!
To extract your key (no passphrase) from such a device an attacker needs very very high skills and most likely very very expensive equipment (electron microscope and such). If you have a passphrase, no equipment helps a thief to get to your coins besides the $5 wrench.

That's not how it works. Eventually it's the users who decide whom they give money for their crypto. It does not matter what devs decide or miners. You can mine what you wish, but if you don't find anyone offering you money for it on the market you'll mine at a loss.

While it is technically possible it would be a very very hard way for an attacker to go. Assuming you don't run executables you find on USB sticks on your airgapped computer (mount with noexec?), an attacker would have to compromise your USB stack on the airgapped computer via the USB-sticks firmware. Then it would possibly get your keys, and be able to hide them somewhere on the usb stick. Then it needs to hack the USB stack on your controling computer to be able exfiltrate the data. I'm not saying it's impossible, but your risk model just changed from "beware of malware on your windows pc" to "the guys who invented stuxnet to kill centrifuges are now after my bitcoin".

He is not saying that bitcoin is fractionally reserverd, but that blockchain is fractionally reserved. "You pretend to have more blockchain than you have" \[4:30\]. And he is proud of having created this term (fractionally reserved blockchain). And it boils down to not being able to close  all LN channels at once, which he calls a bank run, as not everyone can make their settlements at the very same time.  And then later \[6:23\] he says people give their money to the LN nodes, who loan it out to other people. 
Harddisk vendors should be getting into this concept of fractional reserving storage space, would give them a huge boost :)

The decision you refer to is about the order of transactions, which is the miners job.

@_date: 2017-05-23 12:29:51
The changes we had so far were different. It was a change proposed and agreed upon by almost everyone. Miners didn't reach consensus, they upgraded the network by signaling readiness, and passing a threshold. 
Now we have an improvement to be deployed that some miners fight for reasons that are not aligned with users. Bitmain wants to keep its $120M annual benefit due to asicboost and thus opposes SegWit. 30% of miners are not ready for anything, which in my eyes means they don't care. So it's up to those using/buying coins to signal what coin they are willing to work with, and how they want their bitcoin. And this seems to be segwit via UASF.
@_date: 2016-10-16 20:00:15
He is not giving much more information than before. Bitcache is "off chain transactions", only new bit is that other websites can implement Bitcache support, but it seems not to be anything like lightning. Anyway, can't be bad news.....

Ver said he wasn't even there, but he is listed as signer. It is also completely unclear if those who signed will actually try to activate segwit or just lower activation threshold to 80% and then still block it. It's just a distraction.

You can't really avoid it. It happens as miners mine on headers only for a few seconds after a new block is found. Another possible explanation would be that they use patented asicboost in a covert way, but they promised they don't do that. So you stick with 
This block especially was within 35s of the one before, so 1) is actually quiet good for an explanation here. If they included transactions, they would risk that they are incompatible with the block they mine upon, so they rather go empty.

AntPool is advocating Emergent Consensus (EC) as a way to scale, to allegedly keeping their covert asicboost advantage.
The thing is, by choice of pools respectively proposals they support, miners have some influence on the further development of bitcoin. Many miners seem to be unaware of this. AntPool is by many considered to build up a monopoly and seizing too much control, so a bad choice to mine with.

Well, once you want to spend that, you will spend ~150 UTXOs, this is some quiet big transaction, requiring a high fee. Fee is rising right now, and while no one can foresee the future, short term it will certainly rise even more. So consolidate now! Use a minimum fee and see if it goes through within a week...
As said above the fee depends on the tx size, and the tx size depends on the utxos. with roughly 150 utxos your tx will be about 150x180+44=27kb in size, you should at least pay 100 stoshi per byte, so 2700k satoshi so ~ $40 to consolidate. And this $40 might be $80 quickly... or more unlikely drop down to $20, anyway, weekends are cheaper ;)
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:41:53

I'd guess they accept 0conf, especially for small transactions. Of course you can doublespend them, but that would make you a thief. You could just hide the candy in your pocked or pay with a handpainted $50 bill if you'd wanted to risk that.

You confuse "signaling readiness" with "reaching consensus". If you think that's the same thing, so be it.
For the requested source: Andreas Antonopoulos made this calculation in some video, here is a text version of it.  - I think the text talks of 100M, but I think Andreas used the figure of 120M.
About the non-signaling miners.... If I only knew, what do you think? How can miners not have an opinion on the current problems? How is scaling not a topic on on r/bitcoinmining?
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:15:16
I share your worries, but keep in mind that the passphrase is an extra security feature on top. So even if someone captures your passphrase he won't be able to access your coin. Your risk scenario would need to include some targetted attack to you, in RL and cyberspace, to succeed.
Also, ledger nano s allows for inputting the passphrase on the device directly.
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:55:01
So when you asked me for a source on the $120M you already knew sources for that?
Anyway, I only read the first Medium post, and focused on the most important difference in the models: $1 invest for $1 in btc vs $0.1 invest for $1 in profit. $1 is not correct, but the costs will always be close to $1, if it wasn't more hashing power would be deployed until it hits $1. It's not just about $/kWh, it's also infrastructure costs, maintainance costs, workforce, management, downtimes that you need to put into this calculation. Then the author quotes price appreciation.... well if you want to bet on bitcoin to appreciate just go long and skip the part with setting up a mining operation.

Well, with rising tx fees consolidating might be a great idea. Every input costs you &gt;$1 now to spend, if this rises to &gt;$10 and your inputs are about $10 each you'd be happy if you consolidated now.

Yet with the current fee situation you should balance that. Cash out every 4-8 weeks, limits the risk of being goxed vs. the fees you pay. Also you might pay the fees twice, and the 2nd time in an unknown hight, if you spread your wealth over too many UTXOs.

The "compromise" by DCG is bullshit, or at least way to unclear. Ver already backed out "I wasn't there". Also They agree to "HF 2 MB and lower SegWit activation to 80%" wich might be just fucking with bitcoin users. If the undersigned only accept SegWit if it gets 80% miner readiness but don't signal it. It's a trap, or needs to be more precise and actually signed by the people listed in there.

So when you signed up/payed you entered a random message to them? In this case it sounds like a legit request. Of course it will only work, if you control the private key to the sending address, but this seems to be the case.

It is a terrible idea - having half the private key does not half the work bruteforcing the rest, but rather square-roots it. Even worse in case of a 12 word mnemonic seed, as there is a checksum in it as well.

Electrum, and all other HD wallets, come with unlimited key/addresses derived from your 12/18/24 word seed. They are just calculated one after another every time you use one.
Publik keys and addresses are not the same, but connected, as the address is the hash of the public key (p2pkh).

@_date: 2016-05-07 18:15:20
If people are unwilling to sell, thus hold, it means they value bitcoin way higher than it is currently traded for. So the stronger the hodl, the higher the price.
Obviously there is as many people valuing it at $460 that want to sell as there are people who want to buy - hence the current price. Every sell in a system lowers the price, every buy increases it. Of course there are other factors, too.

A signed message is confirmation by the keyholder that the message reflects his view/opinion/whatever.
The plaintext is not to be 3rd-party chosen, it has to include a clear statement: "Satoshi Nakamoto and Craig Wright are the same person" or "I am Craig Wright". CW can actually chose the exact text to sign, but it has to be of clear meaning.
Also it would be helpful if the message would be published along with the signature :p

The download itself is via https, so the most basic man in the middle attacks are bound to fail. It would be possible to intercept the initial connection to electrum.org and *not* redirect to https, if just "electrum.org" is entered and no attention is being payed. Or of course the laptop could have been prepared with extra root certificates, but assuming the laptop was tampered with would have made "signature verification" pointless anyway.
Also the verificatoin process is not that simple.
- download pgp
- verify pgp (how?)
- download the electrum .asc
- download the electrum .asc public key
- verify that the signature fits the binary of electrum
- verify that the key used for signing actually belongs to the electrum team/dev/...
So even if the .asc was downloaded that would not prove much...
What would really be helpfull is the message+signature for everyone to validated in their own trusted environment.

Sadly it's not a single block fork. The miners actually enforcing bip91 would orphan this block and build upon the chain as without this block. The miners not enforcing bip91 would build upon this block. Luckily the honest chain is wipeout protected, the dishonest is not. But at 50:50 this poses a high risk.
I don't think this will happen, just explaining why signaling but non-enforcing bip91 might lead to longer forks.

Actually that is a very good question, and plenty of people are doing it horribly wrong as the fee changed a lot lately. Depending on the value of each purchase it might be a very very good idea to consolidate, as tx fees are relative to tx size and fees are climbing. Just send all (or many) of your coin in a single tx to a single address to consolidate. Bad for privacy, good if you believe tx fees will keep rising.

You can't design a rule to prevent this. If they were not allowed to mine empty blocks they could pull fake tx out of thin air, circling their own bitcoin 3000 times. This would not benefit anyone but also grow the blockchain by 1 MB. There are several reasons for miners mining empty: a) covert asicboost, b) mining on block headers only a few moments after another block has been found.

Rootstock is not 100% trustless, it has great benefits and I'm awaiting it eagerly, but it has its issues, too.

That is somehow correct, but there is a huge problem within.
We need to lock in SegWit with 100% now. If one block does not signal SegWit and this leads to the SegWit signaling being &lt;100% it would mean (some) miners do not reject this block. Other miners will reject this block in accordance with BIP91 and/or BIP148 (starting 1. August). So if SegWit signaling is below 100% it most likely means we are forking, which is what no one wants.

tx: transaction
utxo: unspend transaction output, this is where bitcoins reside. any tx refereneces one or more utxos as inputs, and an address as output. utxos are always spend completely, yet one of their outputs might be on the same address as one input. next time bitcoin accumulated on the same address are spend, another utxo gets referenced.
@_date: 2019-05-10 08:20:17
This is a decision made by the individual wallet. But the logical thing seems to be to use E as it minimizes tx size, so tx fee.
Other things to consider besides fee is privacy, which might mean to use a minimal number of necessary utxos.
Oh, and tx does not use "addresses" but utxos, so I'm assuming that all the funds in your tab are due to a single utxo each.

I'd be tempted to support the silbert agreement if it was clear that all signers would actually endorse SegWit. Sadly this is not part of the agreement. They don't commit to signaling SegWit, just to lower the activation threshold. I don't know if this is left unclear on purpose, or if any party just "signed" it because it was left unclear.
And by the way, why is anything "signed" by putting your name underneath instead of your signature? This is embarrassing.

In my eyes it's a good thing. Core suggested SegWit to activate at 95% readiness which is not directly going to happen. Users threatened to ignore any blocks/chains not 100% signaling SegWit to force it's activation (UASF). Miners didn't want it to look like users have a say and decided to do the very same thing 2 weeks ahead of the users and attach some "in a few month we will do some nonsense" (SegWit2x/NYA). For now SegWit2x and UASF are pretty much doing the same thing, let's see what happens in a few month when 2x tries to double the nonwitness-blocksize. It seems like SegWit2x might actually activate, thus activating SegWit. Anyway, users being ready for UASF is still critical unless it actually activates, to prevent foul play.
@_date: 2018-12-10 10:20:05
some people just seek attention this way. Anyway, sorry for your loss. Hope you find plenty bitcoin at least.

You could try to resend it with a higher fee/byte, you might still end up cheaper and without unwanted outputs.
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:54:04
Now it's down to BW and a few unidentified miners who are not signaling anything. Thats progress, too. I credit the movement to the UASF efforts and hope we won't need UASF in the end. Until then: keep going UASF.

When I read the headline I expected the CEO speding $40k on some luxury cruise or something. A company get together for a prolonged weekend is nothing too exotic in my eyes. Not even blow or hookers? I'm in a it company, we do this every year (also without the blow and hookers ;). If you save money on not having an office and having people working internationally at home once in a while you pay them a flight.

Also, in a more serious reply: SegWit enables schnorr and other features, so throughput can get even higher due to some side effects of SegWit.

I'll sell my coins when a small portion of my bitcoin can have a huge impact on my life. Buy a nice house with a small share of my coin, reduce work or retire.....

As always it depends on *what* you use bitcoin for. 
"Man jailed for using water" is ok with me if he drowned someone in it.

How much does bitcoin have to appreciate so that you can afford to spend 829 of them for this house?

You can't park money in bitcoin. You can send it on a roller coaster ride, but that's about the only option.
@_date: 2017-06-23 05:52:49
If you assume that SegWit allows for 4x the amount of tx and that 2x doubles blocksize it'd theoretically be 8x as much as currently - but it depends on the amount of witness data per tx.

Oh great, turn this into a stupid flex blocksize argument.
The reason JihanCoin requires a &gt;1MB block is exactly to distinguish the chains, reorg protection etc. so your argument is even more stupid. But of course you can reply to any post like this, because blocksize!

Don't forget Willy, maybe the price was driven by a fraudulent buyer. Situation is different today as there is no single dominant exchange...

If sell and buy would be both at 8000  the trade would be resolved and you'd have that gap again.
I guess the minimum gap to expect is 2x the trading fee. Check it for anything, with gold you usually have +-5%.

I'd be in support of Segwit2x (if it actually activates Segwit), but as there is a very very high risk of this being stalling tactics, I'll progress bip148 and welcome everyone who supports it. If SegWit2x is ready by then and signalling SegWit, great. If they get lost in 1000 issues like I expect... fine, too - bip148 it is.
Edit: bit/bip, damn typos :p

hardly possible to do such a thing without a blockchain.
@_date: 2017-06-19 07:22:09
As the JihanCoin requires inclusion of a block &gt;1MB it won't be possible at all. If this restriction was not there, it would be possible as long as not a single block diverted from this route. But this would be the same as 100% support (or &gt;50% support, depends on your point of view) for bip148.
@_date: 2017-06-19 06:25:52
I think I heard that android has an integrated HSM and that there are wallets using it. I can't find sources for any of these two, so it might be entirely wrong, sorry in this case.
