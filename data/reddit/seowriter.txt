This reminds me of 2015. I used to write articles for bitcoins. Maybe earned 1 btc writing articles only.
Read this [article on Victorian gold rush](
Its the second result on google for keyword "victorian gold rush".
One of the best articles written by me.
I lost some coins since then, but still hold some. And have seen 25 times jump in my holdings. Overall, I feel like one of these pioneers. Hah.

Noob question: are you implying that if Satoshi were to spend any bitcoin he owns, it would be known publicly that it was Satoshi spending his money?

Money here is nothing but "evidence" of **suspected** illegal activity. So the authorities can withhold it just as they can withhold a gun that is suspected to be used in a crime scene. 
In this case, the suspected illegal activity is the possibility that the this guy was trying to save tax by depositing less than the regulated amount that needs to be declared in the tax forms or banking forms etc. 
It just so happens that this guy was not actually trying to save tax or doing anything illegal, but it is definitely possible that someone could do the same thing to do something illegal. I am in India and people here deposit 49,000 Rs all the time to get away with the Rs 50,000 limit that is supposed to bring you under Income tax rader ( you have to declare your PAN number with Rs 50,000 and above). In USA, 49000 Rs deposits will bring in structuring laws that are discussed here.

As someone from India, I can tell you that India is way behind in stuff like this. Knowledge of Bitcoin is limited to a very thin elite in large cities like Mumbai. Further, Indian population, in general ( and you can look at how many of them go for 8% post office schemes rather than mutual funds), is risk averse, so they are not going to go out a lot with something that has not been tried and tested. 
Also note that 
Overall, this news is kinda misleading.

The amount lost is very minuscule.

In USA, aren't there soup kitchens? Or government giving out food coupons? 
I am from India, and even in India no one actually starves. I mean, there may be someone somewhere in some corner of India, but their issue would be more than just money( maybe they dont get along with neighbors, or stuff like that). 
worst case scenarion, you can go to a Sikh Gurudwara, a large one, and they give free food, to everyone, rich or poor.

Another way is people who die without mentioning details about their coins in their will, or people who die without a will. 
Lot of coins must be lost this way, since death rate is more than 1% in general.

Don't buy anything that you won't mind losing 50% of in 1 week. 
Basically, buy that much bitcoin only if you can afford to lose 80% of it. Or even more. 
Bitcoin is at $240 now. It could go to $120 without batting an eyelid. 
Bitcoin is not an asset to be invested in. Investing in bitcoin is like investing in dollars. There is no guarantee that bitcoin price will keep on increasing. 
here is my final suggestion: "Invest" 20% of what you mentioned in bitcoin. If price rises to $300, invest another 20%. If price rises to $400, buy 20% more. and so on. 
@_date: 2015-05-09 12:03:49
I only recently started accepting bitcoins. So I haven't sold any. I need an outlet too. 
From all I've heard, its harder to buy bitcoins in India, so one should easily find buyers. But I haven't looked into it that much, cause the price of bitcoin is stable for now.

None of the bitcoins are lost in transactions. The difference between the input and output of transactions is called fees, and is taken by the miner. So the net difference between input and output+fees is 0. So nothing is lost during transaction.
However, people can lose their bitcoins if they forget their passwords to coinbase account. Or worse, they forget their seeds to their trezor or their Electrum wallet. 
They can lose bitcoin if they misplace or lose their physical hard disks or usb drives while shifting their house or any other time. These devices may contain their wallets in 'cold storage', for example.

I am a freelance writer from India. A client sent me $100 last month using PayPal, and I only saw the Rupee equivalent of $91.69. 
With bitcoin, I don't have to lose out that much to a financial intermediary. 
Having received $750 in bitcoin, I can estimate I have saved about $750 * 8% = $60 in paypal and currency conversion fees. 
However, the gains are notional because I have decided to hold on to my 3 bitcoins. 
But that is my own decision etc. I could have sold them too. In fact I may sell them in next 10 days.

The best way to make money when you own bitcoins is to just hold on to them. As bitcoin's price increases, and as long as it does, the value of your stash of bitcoins will keep on increasing. 
Then in future, down the road in about ten twenty years, you can sell them and make a profit. 
That's called "holding". This is the best "strategy" to make money from bitcoin, and followed by almost everyone here.
Other than that, you can earn more bitcoins and money by doing odd jobs on @_date: 2015-05-08 14:19:03
That makes sense only when bitcoin here means something very cheap that anyone can buy. haha
Its funny, but kinda not what bitcoins means.

Just money can't increase GDP. You need to produce more, consume more, and basically improve productivity etc to actually increase GDP. 
At the same time, as lumenkraft mentions, any money saved by avoiding inefficient systems is a net save, so the GDP should, kinda, save that much money. (Not that GDP will increase totally; only the cost associated with foreign transactions will be a net save).

Rather than circlejerking on price or why you sold or bought btc, this sub needs to focus on projects like these. Real world applications of bitcoin, that is.

When a relatively useless utility like facebook is valued at $300 billion, I don't see why a global ledger can't be 1 trillion.

main reason is that bitcoin could be overvalued now. There is no reason why it HAS to be at $4000. It could work as well at $400 per bitcoin. So you could lose money if the price adjusts downwards. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:22:09
what happens when this happens? Does bitcoin again fork into two different coins?

Don't do any trading. 
Only invest for the long term, which means 4+ years in bitcoin world. 
Only invest in bitcoin, bitcoin cash, or Litecoin. 
My ideal portfolio is bitcoin 90%. Bitcoin Cash 8% and Litecoin 2%. 
I only trust bitcoin based currencies, because I don't trust any other one. Every other functionality offered by any other currency can be built by bitcoin, so it is very hard to argue for other currencies. I have looked into Ethereum a bit, and it seems very oversold. Bitcoin's, and other two i mentioned,  has two things going for it: Its a currency, and its a store of value. 
I am a engineering graduate, and a professional programmer, and my age is in 30+, in case you wonder what's my background or experience. I have worked in Bitcoin related space, and created forked cryptocurrencies.
