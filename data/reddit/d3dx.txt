Lol - silly bagholder. Bitcoin is going nowhere but down. No one cares about bitcoin anymore, no one. Not institutions, not people, not anyone. It's dead. Move on.

You are so delusional it's tragic. You are just a patsy in the ponzy scheme and you don't even realize it. You honestly think, you can "hodl" and become rich. You know, no pleb in history has ever beaten the odds - yet here you are, in a delusion of grandeur. You, will fail.
The hype is over, the game is lost. Get out while you can, the price is amazing for those who got in early. But, don't stay in. Bitcoin produces nothing, just heat. Its an entropy machine. WHY would a silly thing, like that, have value ? It doesnt. Companies, nations, they DO shit. Bitcoin, burns energy and makes heat. It does, nothing.

It is backed by the production of the nations. Bitcoin, produces nothing but heat. It only has current value due to money laundering, you know this, i know this, everyone knows. Bitcoin is just an entropy machine. It does nothing useful. Who the fuck cares about SHA256 sums, no one. Thats who. 
Bitcoin will never, ever, become an asset serious money makers care about. You see, all assets in this world is a reflection of production, be it a nation or a company. Bitcoin does nothing of value, its just  a SHA256 sum of some computation problem. It doesnt grow potatoes, it doesnt mine diamonds or gold, it doesnt ship goods .. essentially, it does, nothing. It never will, it never can.

It is quite clear, that you are incapable of constructing a proper rebutal. You just regurgitate some popular culture reference, and think thats a rebutal. It isn't. But the fact that you, based on such a performance, think that is a top notch reply, is even more evidence, btc holders are gonna burn. Because, like Jon Snow, you know, nothing.
You are in good company though, in this echo chamber. But reddit, isn't gonna carry a worthless piece of shit forever.

People buying lottery tickets, their opinions? Worthless. Your buy high or low, worthless. This whole subreddit is made up of sub 50K worth individuals cirklejerking. It would be hilarious if it wasnt so fucking tragic. You will end up like Want some somber reading, go there.

I dont invest in junk. Bitcoin isnt even a pink sheet shit stock. It's only traded on unregulated, semi, if not fully, scam exchanges. USDT you think that is 1:1 and not prone to bankruns? Oh no, man. The second people want real fiat, USDT/tether, goes to hell. Its all a fucking joke.

They're gonna use money issued by the major powers, backed by military, and production. Not a coin which has 0 value outside of neckbeards and speculation. Bitcoin doenst produce anything, infact, it costs money to even exist. While companies that actually make value, you laugh at? Ahaha, you're gonna loose everything.
