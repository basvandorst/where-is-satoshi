Thanks for the comment, this is my thoughts on the current market as well, stock up for the next rise, I’m prepared to wait years and just trade here and there to increase my holdings, institutional investors will come once regulations arrive and the next bubble will be epic! Stay safe people ��

Great that means plenty of time to accumulate more bitcoin through 2019 before the next parabolic rally

Most people get ‘hindsight bias’ when a price either rises - I wish I had of bought earlier or when price drops - I wish I would have sold and not been so greedy, it’s just human nature, it’s easy to connect the dots looking back, we should all just remain calm, learn from this crash and remember we are alive and can use our brain power to make more money and recoup losses, just don’t sell your cryto if you lost a lot, it will be back
Be patient ��
I believe without a doubt this technology will support a global digital currency for humanity to benefit from, just look at the positive news coming out of the space
There will be another bubble even bigger then Before, total global wealth is so much bigger and dwarfs cryto currency

It’s easy to buy at ATH for most people as they have seen a rise in price and think they are missing out, they take stupid risks and follow the crowds, they have no knowledge of markets or what they are investing in or even how to invest and just let emotions run wild, it’s natural human behavior, I am guilty of it and have lost money, not in the latest crash as I bought very early last year but I can imagine how pissed off the bag holders must be right now
