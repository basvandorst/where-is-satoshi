See negative that is what you are. 
I asked a question very simple. 
You answered with a false statement.

Dear sfgfd,
Bitcoin Fundraiser Users Org is here to help the homeless as long as bitcoin can be transferred. It is not a scam. A newly formed fundraiser that only accepts digital currency. Claiming we are stealing peoples coins is a lie! 
I would like to see you make a difference with helping. Instead of jumping on a comment box leaving a negative feedback making a false claim. And than to top it of "And that website sucks dude."
What are you doing to make a positive difference in the world sfgfd?

Well if you have any extra BTC to donate or other cryptocurrencys visit  and make a donation towards a amazing charity. Accept 24 different cryptocurrencys as donations! This is a traditional Bitcoin Fundraiser. Show some love! :D

Coming from the only user leaving feedback on every single post of mine. Your are the one leaving negative anything and causing negativity on this post and my account. Your not positive person.
I asked you a simple question and now you go on all my post and comment scammy scamm scam? Your no better than a 5 year old kid saying the same thing over and over.
Hide behind your computer. Say what you have to say on your keyboard.
If your ever homeless. I hope nobody helps you.
