Ah. I just realized it is Eric Voorhes. I should reach out to him.
@_date: 2014-03-15 22:33:27
Very interesting take... I definitely need to account for that.
@_date: 2014-03-16 03:47:34
I am not sure where you got the idea that 2 people have agreed to it.
I have 1 person who has shown serious interest and is working to ensure it is all done legally and above board.
I am also willing to work with people who would like to make a similar bet on a smaller scale.
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:17:27
This idea came to me over the weekend. I have already spoken to my media contacts and will be reaching out to Berkshire Hathaway this week once all the pieces are in place.
@_date: 2014-03-16 03:59:54
I will accept counter offer... I have also modified the original post. Let me know if you are interested.
@_date: 2014-03-15 19:25:17
I am working to revise the offer to make it more accessible to the Bitcoin community. I am potentially going to create an offer with Class B shares.
Please email me with suggestions or interest: buffettforbitcoins
@_date: 2014-03-15 18:35:28
I received your email. I am working on putting together revised conditions in order to have this make sense for all parties. I will reply shortly.
@_date: 2014-03-15 18:30:45
Hi. If you are interested, please email me: BuffettForBitcoins
@_date: 2014-03-15 05:19:43
I'm not sure I understand your statement.
Whom are you saying does not have a chance of losing the bet? Me or you?
@_date: 2014-03-15 23:03:41
I believe you may be incorrect in your assessment.
Bitcoins can never be "converted" to fiat, but rather given to another person who uses Bitcoins. The fact that fiat currency exchanges hands would have no effect on Bitcoin since it exists in a vacuum. The issue is that even when miners sell their coins, they are still increasing the supply of Bitcoins in circulation.
I may be wrong, but that is my understanding.
@_date: 2014-03-16 03:55:12
Please see the edited post, I am putting together an offer using class B shares.
@_date: 2014-03-16 03:57:49


@_date: 2014-03-16 03:58:07
I am now offering the bet on class B shares at .25 BTC each. Please email me if you are interested: BuffettForBitcoins
@_date: 2014-03-16 03:45:41
I am definitely not Warren Buffet. But I am a Nebraska Cornhuskers Football fan.
@_date: 2014-03-16 04:07:18
Hi Ryan,
Thanks for the feedback. While you may be hesitant, I am working with a few interested parties right now to ensure everything is public and auditable.
If you are not interested in the bet or believe bitcoin will go down in value, I encourage you not to participate.
Mods, feel free to contact me @ BuffettForBitcoins and I will gladly confirm my identity.
@_date: 2014-03-15 19:24:05
I am looking into putting together a smaller pool with the Class B shares. Stay tuned and feel free to email me with interest: buffettforbitcoins
@_date: 2014-03-16 04:03:13
 - Did you receive my email response. I believe I may have a way for this to work out with you providing BTC as collateral and not have to worry about fiat conversion.
Please keep in touch.
@_date: 2014-03-16 03:46:23
I modified the offer since anyone who is willing to take the bet most likely owns Bitcoins vs stock. If someone would like to enter into the bet using US Dollars or Stock, I would gladly consider it.
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:28:01
Thanks for the advice. Is there a way to just share a link to this posting, rather than copy and paste it?
@_date: 2014-03-15 05:17:42
No, sort of the opposite.
I believe in 1 year, a single share of Berkshire Hathaway will be worth more that 300 Bitcoins. Therefore, I am saying the value of Bitcoin will drop or the value of Berkshire Hathaway will increase at a more rapid rate than Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-03-15 19:27:39
Crowd sourcing is one option. I am also working on putting together an offer for Class B shares.
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:09:58
Do you mean me?
@_date: 2014-03-15 19:22:22
Potentially I would accept an offer of 50% and we can use Class B shares as collateral. Please email me to discuss: buffettforbitcoins
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:05:06
That would be perfect. Do you know anyone who would be willing to work with me?
@_date: 2014-03-16 04:08:31
I am still offering the original deal to those who emailed me, but wanted to extend it to people who do not have 300 BTC to wager.
I appreciate you hesitance, but not everything is designed to be a scam.
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:32:31


Time will tell my friend.
@_date: 2014-03-15 05:21:20
That is correct. Berkshire tends to grow at a relatively slow rate compared to most momentum stocks and big tech names.
@_date: 2014-03-17 15:28:43
Gee... I wonder where he got the idea for this
@_date: 2014-03-15 18:45:30
I've received a few emails and have read all the posts. I will update the OP shortly with a slightly revised terms based on suggestions.
@_date: 2014-03-15 19:15:17
If I cannot find a buyer, I will create a new offer with class B shares. 3 BTC would be worth approx 15 shares of class B
@_date: 2014-03-15 22:47:10
That is a chart comparing Berkshire Hathaway to the WEIGHT of gold! Not the value of it and it stops at 2010.
The value of gold has increased exponentially since 2000 including a peak reached around 2011.
The chart is bullshit and doesn't represent anything at all.
@_date: 2014-03-15 19:28:37
Once the deal is finalized and before anything changes hands, I will reveal my Identity. This is not designed to be a scam, but rather something to garner publicity.
@_date: 2014-03-15 18:36:57
I assure you this is not a troll. As I mentioned, I will be able to facilitate press coverage once everything is put together.
@_date: 2014-03-15 19:27:12
I would be open to that.
@_date: 2014-03-15 19:13:50
This would be the equivalent of a futures contract as opposed to an option. The settlement date would be fixed.
However, if someone would like to discuss an alternative bet, I will gladly take it under consideration. Please email me: buffettforbitcoins
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:42:05
Does that mean you are interested in the offer?
@_date: 2014-03-15 19:18:13
Could you please elaborate? Are you offering to fund whomever wants to accept the bet?
If so, I may take you up on your offer if there is someone who wishes to make the bet. 
Would you email me with your contact info: buffettforbitcoins
@_date: 2014-03-16 15:33:14
Unfortunately, I wouldn't consider participating in this bet on this site.
I firmly believe that by next year Bitcoin will be worth 0 and even if I were correct, the prize that would be paid out would not be worth anything.
I would however still consider alternative terms whereas if I am correct, my prize would be paid in fiat.
Any interest in making a side bet?
@_date: 2014-03-15 19:10:57
If I don't find anyone for the class A, I will look into putting together something smaller with Class B
@_date: 2014-03-15 18:47:23
This is not a scam. Once the deal is signed, my identity will be revealed as well as press coverage. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 03:57:37
I am now offering the bet on class B shares at .25 BTC each. Please email me if you are interested: BuffettForBitcoins
@_date: 2014-03-15 18:32:57
I would be willing to work with a pool of bitcoiners if needed. This was simply the initial idea, and I am open to revising the wager as needed.
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:43:17
@_date: 2014-03-16 15:29:18
Looks like someone beat me to the punch. Well done sir.
@_date: 2014-03-15 19:16:00
I will consider alternative ways of securing the transaction if travel is not required. I simply wanted to make that offer to prove my legitimacy.
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:52:05
The deal is a fixed date contract, whereas the winner will be determined based on the price on a fixed date 1 year from now. Market fluctuation in between would not affect the contract settlement date except if Bershire Hathaway declares bankruptcy/ceases to trade, or the Bitcoin Protocol ceases to function.

I am now offering the bet on class B shares at .25 BTC each. Please email me if you are interested: BuffettForBitcoins
@_date: 2014-03-16 19:08:45
I'll remind everyone that this is based on my post from 2 days ago: 
[Legitimate Wager: 300 Bitcoins vs. 1 Class A Share of Berkshire Hathaway ](
It would be fantastic if whomever made the bet and reached out to me if they are interested in wagering with me directly. I will not make the bet through BitBet for 2 reasons:
* 1) I need at least half of the winning prize be US Dollars or Stock in the event the bet is won by the value of Bitcoin plummeting or discontinuation of the Blockchain Protocol or Hard Fork
* 2) I am offering security, insurance, and a guarantor including cold wallet storage for both the Bitcoin (Paper Wallet) and Stock Certificate or Cashiers Check.
**I am still working with a few interested parties to adjust terms and tweak the agreement. Feel free to email or reply with interest: BuffettForBitcoins
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:30:09
That's a fair point. I just wanted to leave it as an option since purchasing stock can be complicated if you don't have a brokerage account.
Escrow is also a great idea.
@_date: 2014-03-15 20:55:48
I'm not sure how I can show proof, but if you can think of something, I'd gladly attempt to prove it.
I have been responding to all emails that have been received, and if I was a troll, I'd imagine pursuing this endeavor would be a colossal waste of my valuable time.
@_date: 2014-03-15 23:44:01
I've just updated with a different wager for those interested.
@_date: 2014-03-16 03:49:49
With proper hedging, I am more than comfortable making the bet.
As mentioned before, this bet has far better statistical odds for the Bitcoin bull.
