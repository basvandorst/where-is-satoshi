Why does it do a 100BTC transfer and then send some to the address I requested and some to the other MultiBit wallet? Why not all my coins? I lost most of my coins but I still have some left...

I always delete the .wallet file after I have exported+edited+imported. Then I did the transfer and deleted the wallet in MultiBit using the File menu.

I assume that the OS does reuse the sectors when simply editing a file... Binary searching through my USB stick now, but so far I've only found my brainwallet...

I did. I've had experimental wallets and I transferred a few bitcents and then back. And everything seemed fine. And then I emptied the wallet. Didn't notice this problem.

The computer is a laptop with an SSD split in two partitions. One for Win7, and one for Ubuntu. I'm assuming Xubuntu live might use the swap on my SSD. I booted up Xubunut live and started the MultiBit client, exported the key, edited the .key file and replaced the key with my brainwallet key, then imported the key back in MultiBit. I then transferred 12BTC to blockchain and did File-&gt;Delete Wallet. I rebooted my laptop to ubuntu and some hours later found out that the balance of my brain wallet was missing 80BTC. I then rebooted my laptop, fired up MultiBit again(!), exported key, substituting my brainwallet key, imported key, hoping my balance would be more. I then panicked, pulled out the USB stick and booted up ubuntu to do a dump of the stick.
Since I have been using the laptop since, I guess there's no hope for the swap idea. I am so tired. It's bedtime and I haven't eaten since breakfast.

I think I have found the position of the data where the wallet content USED to be. It is a bunch of nonsense data. The encrypted timestamped private key export file you speak of is probably not relevant, since I never imported the relevant key. It was only generated by MultiBit, then exported.

I have found a wallet in the binary dump of the USB stick. I really don't think it's the right one, but I'll have a try. How does MultiBit store the wallets? What is the format of the multibit.wallet file?

I have a persistent partition on my Xubuntu usb stick. Everything I store on the Desktop stays there. I exported the MultiBit key to the Desktop, but I edited it and replaced it with my own key. I am currently doing a cat /dev/sdb &gt; usbsdb.bin and the plan was to do a binary search in it. I don't have very much hope.

i did a full binary dump (cat /dev/sdb &gt; file.bin) of the usb stick. multibit.wallet files contain the string "org.bitcoin.production", and by searching for this string i get 2 hits. however, I'm searching though a huge binary blob and I'm trying to figure out what to extract. I still don't think it's the right wallet though...

If I had only seen a post like this a few weeks ago, I wouldn't have lost a big chunk of bitcoins. I've played around with small amounts of BTC since early 2012, and I thought I knew enough to safely handle my coins. Then used a brainwallet and failed. I assume that OP saw my desperate post.

Looks like the wallets are rather small 100-1000 bytes, and all start with "org.bitcoin.production". I get a few hits on this string in the binary dump, but I don't know how much data is part of the wallet (how much do I copy). I'm still working on it, but I don't have much hope.

starting fresh, multibit only has one key, right? i exported the wallet in this way:
