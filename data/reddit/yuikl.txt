*If* OP is the hacker as he claims, my guess is he's just using the wallet/give-away to muddy the waters as he mixes his BTC around.  He now has hundreds (maybe thousands by now) of wallet addresses to possibly disperse tainted coins to...which would be fun to watch, albeit with some guilt since they're stolen property.  I don't want dirty money, but there's something very entertaining in watching a thief disperse some of his spoils.  There might be a fair amount of downward pressure as he tries to convert it too, which makes me frustrated...but that's the wild west for you!

It's like watching the evolution of banks in fast-forward.  It's really messy, though...barbarians at the gates, raiding our coffers!

That's funny, I looked it up a couple hours ago.  I'm sure *that* page is getting lots of hits.  It's really vague, from what I read.

There might be some use in cataloging hundreds of redditor's public wallet addresses, or getting major PR/weight in the community while remaining pseudo-anonymous.  I don't see a use that merits 1000BTC giveaway for anything other than shits and giggles.  They can just send it off to a wallet they own themselves and it'll look like the BTC was indeed given away.  If it actually is some weird altruistic giveaway, they must be swimming in coins and believe giving them to a random person is more fun than putting them to a charitable cause.  I enjoy the thought of a random giveaway, but not enough to join in...it just seems like BS or dirty money.  I hope somebody wakes up in a week with a surprise though!

I think the best example is in banking.  If you send money to a friend, you usually have to use your bank, who then sends it to your friend's bank.  The ledger of your bank will show the money being taken out.  The ledger in your friend's bank will show the money being put in to his account.  But without a bank, how would you send money over the internet?  Instead of "trusting" the banks to do the work, you can use a public blockchain, which doesn't rely on trust of any entity except the blockchain itself.  It's a distributed ledger that is made in a way so that if a fraudulent transaction is attempted, or someone tries to "spend" the same token-of-value twice, the blockchain will by public consensus reject the transaction.  It's a form of "trustless trust", and does not need big institutions like banks to work.

Yeah, especially considering how long it takes for deposits to go through on GDAX.  I put in a support request, they said they'd look into it.  I almost forgot I had ETH in there too, so I withdrew all that as well.  
@_date: 2016-08-19 23:40:44
done, thanks!
@_date: 2016-08-19 23:38:43
Yeah, I've had account with them for awhile and sent a lot more info than I would think should be necessary, but assumed since it was Bitcoin they are extra careful about verifying identity.  I got the GDAX notification and submitted even *more* info.  They have bank statements, photo ID, *etc*.

Right now it's just linking to your coinbase wallet, just showing your balance.  No transfer/payment functionality at this point. At least that's what I got from skimming the article linked on this thread.

Might makes right, I just didn't expect Ethereum to jump for the jugular like that.  You can't get through the new voting system they're fucking the entire network into, unless you have enough power to be heard.  Tail wags the dog, etc.  Maybe Ethereum will work past it and do what it's supposed to be doing, but I don't want to have anything to do with it at this point, except watch and see what happens.  The ability for miners to "act against self-interest" is a funny paradox.  It leaves a lot of room for manipulation.  I don't think BTC is immune to that sort of miner-mania.  There is a big fork debate going on, so in a sense BTC is already being twisted in similar ways.

I chatted with a DAO backer briefly and he became very defensive/dismissive when I mentioned the precedent they may be setting if they do any fork.  I dropped all ETH I held once I read what they were planning to do.  If the DAO and Ethereum foundation itself keep attempting to ignore the issue they are causing by forking due to a third party mistake, they need to be roasted publicly and loudly.  -edit--stuff

Lots of angles, but here:

I'm betting on the price correcting after Jan 1st.  I'm only playing with slush money so if I'm wrong no worries, I've already pulled out more than half at a nice profit.  I'm shedding and hedging as it keeps breaking through my limits. My (admittedly uneducated) thought is that people could be cooking their books at the end of the year by funneling money into BTC, then cashing out after? When I first started playing the BTC market in 2012 the big deal on threads like this was Chinese businessmen finding ways around currency manipulation by buying BTC in huge amounts, but I can't trust anything I read because it's all conjecture afaict.  The more people insist they know the why and when, the less I believe them.

It was a good day, so I nibbled a bit to help with rent, cuz rent is too damn high. maybe another rally will help me get some new shocks.
@_date: 2016-09-03 20:29:15
Ok nice!  Emptying out now, will buy back in once whatever the hell just happened gets corrected.  What kind of buy order jacks the price up that much within minutes?

I got flagged somehow and they stripped my ability to deposit down to $5/day...which is completely useless.  Took about a week before they raised the deposit limit back up.  I asked them to explain and they just blew me off.  If it is indeed an algorithm they must have it ratcheted tight, because I was trading only ~$50 at a time.

I somehow ended up with Roger Ver on my twitter feed, and I have to say he comes across as a bit rabid in his ideologies.  An image of him snorting coke on a copy of the Fountainhead pops in my head sometimes. Unhinged is the feeling I get.

Recently Coinbase dropped my deposit limit to $5/day. No warning, no explanation.  $5/day might as well be 0.  Withdrawals were open, so I took all my BTC out in a panic they were going to freeze the whole thing.  Took about a week, but they opened up my deposit limit back to $10K.  Their email support wouldn't tell me *why* when I asked explicitly, just said this:
"Limits can change for a wide variety of reasons including verifications, payment methods, location and purchase history. I’m sorry I can’t be more specific."
Not very cool...but pretty much as I should expect from any shitty corporate bank.

Interesting: I was 30 in 2010. I'm a nerd. I did both SETI and protein folding. I'd think you were a doppelganger but I didn't play around with BTC until 2012 so you must be the original...:(.

I think they have some automated algorithms that will lock down accounts under certain circumstances.  I had my account locked so that I couldn't put money *in* my coinbase/gdax.  I put in a support request and after ~5 days they opened deposits back up.  By that time I had taken all of my money out of coinbase until I could figure out why they locked my deposits.  I asked them directly via techsupport and they wouldn't give me a straight answer, but it sounded like it was auto-locked due to my trading habits (I was playing the peaks and valleys during a volatile time in the market, must have tripped an alarm somehow).

You'll see that much money in one of your accounts some day soon(ish), legitimately.  It's hard not to spend sometimes, but I setup a special savings account called DO_NOT_TOUCH and autodraft into it every pay check.  Debt-free and watching it grow!

I setup a new account a few months back and slowly started adding subreddits.  I have a very rudimentary understanding of what's going on, but from what I can see it's turned into a name-calling mud-wrestling match.  I am now backing away slowly before I get sucked into what seems to be a case-study in why decentralized control turns into fiefdoms. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 00:28:49
Did they rebrand the exchange to GDAX and go live with ETH today?  I logged in on Tuesday and nothing was different, but now there's more options on the exchange and a splash page saying they've changed names.  I'm wondering if that might have caused a delay in their processing.

If it HAS to be online, then you are never going to be truly "secure", but I assume you already know that.  I personally would setup a cloud server (not just storage, a linux instance that you essentially "own").  Amazon has free micro-instances.  You can encrypt the entire virtual server, place your private keys behind some other obfuscation/encryption method, and store your private keys there.  Then simply turn the instance off until you need to access the keys.  There are probably better ways to do it, but I don't like the idea of any cloud storage solution in which you don't have the ability to turn it off.  A random virtual server sitting dormant in the cloud has much less of a target on it than a company's vault software or other method specifically designed for bitcoin.  It's like how people that use TOR are flagged and targeted by interested parties simply by using the protocol...it's much safer to hide in the open and mix with the crowd.  Just a thought.

or psychosis.  I can't believe this guy would seriously consider being able to con this, unless he's lost his mind or is screwing his name on purpose so people will leave him alone.  Either way it doesn't seem very stable-minded.  Then again, maybe he got caught-up in a private scam that ballooned beyond his control.  
@_date: 2016-05-20 00:36:52
You're getting some off-the-wall advice so far.  Here's my take: Consider your $20 forfeit and use what seems to be the easiest method.  You are experimenting so there's no point in diving into private vaults and obscure wallet software *etc*...depending on your country there are a few big name companies whose job is to hold and trade your BTC.  I've used Coinbase and Bitpay, for both work and personal.  I don't really have a preference.  Only dive as deep into the details as you are comfortable with and remember to enjoy the experiment.  Take any opinion (including mine) with a grain of salt and have fun watching people get bent out of shape, companies crash and burn, drama unfold on Twitter, markets swing and other exciting stuff...It's the wild west of finance, and I love it.

I had ETH through GDAX a couple weeks before the fork.  It wasn't available on their main Coinbase.com accounts until after the fork, just a few days ago, but has traded ETH with GDAX for at least a month or two.
@_date: 2016-07-07 23:08:13
I noticed GDAX stopped giving me CAD options a couple weeks ago, which I assume is related.  I'm out of the loop, is Canada financial law causing this, or did Vogogo flop?
