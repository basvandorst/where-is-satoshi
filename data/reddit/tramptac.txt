We use the daily european central bank rate and add from 1.5% to 2.5% depending on the market
You are right, it uses the minimum value of the day which is not OK. We'll fix it and later switch from ECB to OpenExchangeRate to have hourly rates

We receive a local currency, such as Euros, transform it into bitcoin, and back to a local currency such as Mexican Pesos.

Totally true, we hear a lot about the potential of Bitcoin for IoT.
In that case an increase of 50% transactions per year seems to me really low

SMS sending capability or withdrawing fast from your account ?

Search space size of a 14 characters random password :  4.93 x 10^27
Total hashing power behind bitcoin : &lt; 2.70 x 10^17
So, if you used bitcoin hashing power to brute force a 14 characters password it would still take around 10^3 years
Am I wrong ?
@_date: 2014-11-27 16:23:00
Good initiative, 
As BTC is not a unit of measure for the price for now, it would be nice to also show EUR price conversion
@_date: 2014-10-09 08:43:36
My point is that you can't just avoid the problem of the scalability and turn against without suggesting other solutions.
About the centralization question, the block size increase potential problems is better discussed with gavin on this thread
@_date: 2014-11-03 08:18:20
I have love/faith/stake in cryptocurrencies, I'm not saying it would be better.  I'm saying average people who trust government will be more likely to use it as there is garanty behind it.
In any case, this is not a threat to bitcoin, it would actually help transfer between both currencies

I guess that the exchanger will need a Money Transmitter Licence and either the exchanger or Hellobit will need to do a KYC for the sender

If the advantage of bitcoin is low transaction cost, could countries just use bitcoin as a centralized ledger backed by their currency ?

This is not like this that bitcoin will go mainstream
If you recommend this to people, they will still think Bitcoin is not safe. What about Coinbase vault ? Particularly when it will be multisig

I meant indeed coming up with their own crypto-currency managed at a country level
@_date: 2014-11-02 22:16:17
The point would be to simplify drastically their money system without loosing the control over it.
I would not qualify a centralized blockchain as expensive. It is a money system robust and already up and running

A centralized coin should have transaction cost close to zero as you just need a limited hash power, don't you agree ?
@_date: 2014-11-03 07:31:33
Small transaction fees, no 51% attack, backed by gov currency, transparency, startups able to broadcast transaction to the bank...
I don't say I want this, but we're giving a beautiful tool to the banks

A decentralized system that is not scalable is not helping anyone

I'm afraid this could be quite expensive

@_date: 2014-10-23 17:11:45
What if, they would use it as an open ledger, but not decentralized (maybe mined only by banks) ? 
This would solve their transactions cost problem, this would allow fintech company to interact with the system and they would be able to back the value of the currency
Wouldn't this be their best way out of their crisis coming ?
@_date: 2014-12-03 17:37:55
Thanks, unfortunately this is quite expensive, 10€ minimum to withdraw the money
@_date: 2014-12-05 09:37:56
Does someone share their analysis ?

What you need to know : 
* We have been working on this platform for 1 year, mostly in stealth mode but we started 1 month ago a private beta
* We follow AML/KYC and are compliant in our countries
* We are located in Paris (France) and Nyon (Switzerland) but the legal entity is in Paris (Moneytis SAS)

Could someone ELI5 the advantages of doing this ?
@_date: 2015-01-19 14:29:08
As the blockchain is public, I'm not sure to see the point, are you afraid they would spy the transaction or prevent the broadcast ?
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:29:30
Other possible reason : you do not need to believe in Bitcoin to invest in Coinbase but in crypto currencies.
If another crypto currency compete with Bitcoin, Coinbase would be in a good position to integrate it

However it is built to also work with Bitcoin, pay with Bitcoin and a bitcoin accounting ledger.

Thanks, and +1 for the link to mempool
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:26:45
Thanks for the precision, the transaction did confirm before I double spend it finally.
So much trouble for a floating point issue, but definitely interesting
@_date: 2015-03-12 11:34:11
Thanks, didn't know that if the unspent part of the transaction was dust miners would not allow it...
@_date: 2015-03-19 14:05:54
Interesting ! 
I read the white paper but didn't find how you protect the platform against a dishonest trader who wire the money one day later only if bitcoin rised ?
