Don't worry boys. Meme support at 9000 is strong.

So this was the great bubble of 2017. See you guys at the next bubble in 3 years.

Don't worry. It's just money.

Good question. Probably because price is purley sentiment driven and the current sentiment is the same across the whole crypto space.

The transaction i put in yesterday is showing as completed but there is not blockchain hash and it appears that it was not transfered to the blockchain at all.

GDAX is really slow right now

dayum, i send some btc from gdax to bittrex yesterday. Transaction is showing as completed at gdax, but does not show a hash. When i search for my bittrex wallet on blockchain.info no transactions show up, so apparenlty gdax has not comitted the transaction to the blockchain. I guess i have to contact support. If the drop continues at the current rate the BTC will be worthless by the time this issue is resloved. :D

10k - 19k has been pretty weak memewise

No, it is also showing as completed on coinbase. I send a message to support. Can only take a couple of weeks.
But you are right about the alts. I was going to buy some GBYTE and it dropped 25% today. :D

White caucasians have gotten all the worlds wealth by stealing from the poorest in society. The solution is wearing yellow vests, not wanting to pay carbon taxes and thinking climate change is not that big of a deal and of course buying a highly speculative asset. 
I always thought bitcoin as a libertarian invention. This whole class warfare and identiy politics bullshit is disgusting and hopefully not what bitcoin will stand for.

I doubt that 40% of chinese have money to invest, let alone know what bitcoin is.
