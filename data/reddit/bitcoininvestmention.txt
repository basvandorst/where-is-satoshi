I would definitely prefer this, but I have no equity. I have nothing that has value. I have a high income and a moderate savings in BTC.
I just want more BTC.

Already have more than 1 BTC right now, I want more haha.

Deleting the thread would probably not be enough.
I would probably just get a smaller amount and try to convince someone and/or just forget the idea altogether.

Yeah, I am. I figure I put $1k+/month into BTC already. With this loan, I'd stop buying bitcoin and just start paying off the loan at $600~/month.
With that said, I wouldn't have purchased this morning. ;)

It's for hodling. I'm relatively young for this kind of investment (21), so I figure I can make a risky investment like this for gains in the future.
I personally have no doubt about the future price of bitcoin.

I've just gotten uber-faithful in the technology and I want to take the plunge.
What should I look for in terms of a backup plan? I'm young, I could probably afford bankruptcy if it really got bad. I don't have a house to sell if it happens. Personally, I'd rather save BTC than buy a house, right now.

re: 30k personal loans -- no idea.
I have no idea what kind of personal loans banks give out. No idea if I would have a better chance at a credit union. I doubt they would give me anything if I told them it was for bitcoin. I'm wondering if I could abstract out the idea enough so that they will give it to me without it being fraudulant
With that said, I'm not sure how often criminal charges are pressed for fraudulant personal loan purposes. I'm not saying I would do that, but I guess it's an option.
Another alternative I have is getting a "no-interest" credit card with a high limit (maybe) and purchasing BTC with it.

Ah, good point. Forgot about that fee. :/
EDIT: Also forgot to add that the gains could potentially offset the fee by quite a bit

I work at startups, so I guess call that "stable" heh.
My thoughts are that if I lose my job, I could sell all the bitcoin and pay off the loan quickly -- only if needed. Obviously this would be a last resort situation.
