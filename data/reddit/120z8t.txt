They have no right to the info.  It would be a high level violation of the growers and sellers rights.  What the buyer wants means nothing.  The seller has all the rights here.   Labeling is a controlled market.  A controlled market is communism.  Next up I bet you ask if your water piped to your house is safe to drink.  The seller offered you water you bought it.  The seller did not sell it to you for a certain purpose, they sold you water.  What you do with that water is of no concern to the seller.   Really you need to shut the fuck up and buy or not buy a product based on your needs.

Who gives a fuck what miners think?  How is bitcoin any different then fiat if it will bend to the say of the miners?  If you cater to the miners then you just lost the whole decentralization thing and the miners become for bitcoin what the big banks are to fiat.

I live in Wisconsin. Every damn gas station advertises their fee free atms. The same company that owns those also have atms in every store around here.  The only place you will find a bank owned ATM is at a bank and around here the only way to get charged for using those ATMs is if you use one at a bank that is not yours.

They pay for the ATM's through other banking fees, like over draft fees.  It is basically the same reason you can get free savings or checking accounts. Banks have learned to pay for these services in other ways.  Basically from what I understand most people do not take out more money then they have but the few that do, do it regularly enough that banks can now offer free ATM's and such.

Well to be honest, if you are looking to invest and make a profit, there are many other tried and true ways to do that.  I am all for bitcoin, but it is still in its infancy and a very large gamble to invest large sums of in.

I live in the US and have not seen an ATM that charges a fee in a very long time. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:12:33
No idea why.  It has been up and down for the past few weeks but right now there is a sharp drop. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 01:43:37
Ummm, there are free ATMs all over the place.  In fact I don't know of a single one that charges in my town.

Yeah I tested it, I sent the least amount you can which was 33 cents, the money shows up on the website in the transfers but was not add to my balance and I can't withdraw it back.  I figured it was a scam but was not sure.

Bitcoin value seems to be tanking pretty hard right now.

I think most people are weary of that site because it is an obvious HYIP. 
A high-yield investment program (HYIP) is a type of Ponzi scheme, an investment scam that promises unsustainably high return on investment by paying previous investors with the money invested by new investors. Most of these scams work from anonymous offshore bases which make them hard to track down.

He finished 20th.  On that track that is not bad, he even finished ahead of some previous winners on that track.

The whole fax thing really means nothing.  Tons of governments and banks still use fax to archive a hard copy.

Micro payments  instead of  ads that can be blocked? Fuck that. Micro payments is how the internet becomes the new TV.

I don't think so.  Right now farmers are selling their milk in bulk to companies that distribute the product over a large area. If you eliminate the distributor you would eliminate the majority of consumers that end up buying the farmers milk.  The farmer also loses the ability to sell in bulk and most of the farmers milk would spoil before it could be sold.
