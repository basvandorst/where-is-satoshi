I disagree that they are not really transactions.  
If I used western union to send myself $500 to a branch in mexico, and picked it up there, would that not really be a transaction?
Just because transactions are free and frictionless, it doesnt mean that they dont happen. This just means that if WU was cheaper and easier, people would use it to send themselves money more often than they do.

Unfortunately most of the developers pushing for all of these changes would rather make their own altcoin than develop for bitcoin as there is money to be made in pumping and dumping.
The ones that are too lazy to make their own altcoin want bitcoin developers to implement their ideas that they then make money on, and then the bitcoin developers have to deal with all the bugs that arise from their changes.
People frequently underestimate the repercussions of a mistake or bug in the official client can have on the entire ecosystem. Adding features is one of the best ways to introduce these types of problems into a system.

the private key is under the hologram on the back. the hologram is there for tamper evidence, e.g. if you peel it up and copy the private key the person you're giving it to will know its compromised. You can deposit to the coin without the private key, as the public key is written on the back.

I think the price is encoded in the qr code on most payment processors

My bitcoin address in case anyone wants to put money towards the tablet 
EDIT: As you may have suspected, this is indeed just an excuse to show off my animated qr code, but I am fronting the tablet to the owner since its only going to be about $100. I'm sure he'll give me some discounted sandwiches to make up for it

if someone wants to stop the growth, and thinks the price of the coin is way above what it is worth, then they should set up a buy wall or sell all at once. who cares if they crash the market? I'll buy as much as they'll sell  at $30 per coin. This is why its called a free market, people can do whatever they want. If no one steps in to correct the new price by buying it all up again, then THAT is what the price should be.
It does no harm or no good, it simply is.

level 1 return should be 2.4x-2.5x to bring the returns into being competitive with satoshidice (96-98%) before I'd use it. right now its like 94% :/
