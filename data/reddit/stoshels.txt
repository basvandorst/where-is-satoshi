Does that even make sense?

To nurture your delicate industry, and acquire the clientbase of the distressed business, making your business larger. Very common here in America.

This isn't Callahan Motors and Mark Karpeles isn't Tommy boy.

Please do. If it has anything to do with the Real Bills doctrine, go back and take another macro econ class.

In november, I bought my first bitcoin on local bitcoins at $1150. Been "buying on the way down" every since :(
@_date: 2014-02-25 00:45:54
Right I understand that, but doesn't a short supply, meaning high demand, usually trigger and upward price trend?
@_date: 2014-02-25 00:47:55
Can someone ELI5 the deal with receiving the market price on Friday, February 28th? If it subject to the price floating, what's the point of letting them hold onto your fiat instead of waiting until Friday to make the decision...
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:41:02
so narrow minded. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 10:34:43
I can see where you're coming from but where's the conclusion...
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:08:40
feels like i've been sliced a few times at 640, 620, now 580. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 03:49:56
Everyone cares because the chinese hold the lionshare of bitcoins in circulation. Or just choose not to care. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:19:37
@_date: 2014-03-28 10:51:14
Well said. Nations who maintain control of their people by instilling fear are no friends of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-31 05:04:14
Will chinese citizens still be able to partake in bitcoin transactions?
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:35:54
and they didn't. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 06:28:29
possibly the most valuable bitcoin related takeaway I've heard. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 07:16:00
Try thousands. If i lost only $40 on bitcoin I'd be one happy man. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 04:49:09
What a horrible way to think. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:02:16
So whats the takeway?
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:17:51
just saw 200 coins move on [mtgox for 302 each](
@_date: 2014-04-05 19:18:05
derivative swaps
@_date: 2014-02-25 00:51:40
so it's moot as any type of indication? 
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:54:22
is this related to NeoCoin on cryptsy?
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:40:19
If that's the answer then cryptocurrencies are doomed. Fortunately this is not the answer. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:38:12
Tell that to Comcast and Time Warner Cable my friend. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 17:07:13
The answer of any post that is phrased as a question is no. There's some theory about it. 
@_date: 2016-10-31 16:49:06
Yeah fuck buyer protection, *amirite*?
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:32:51
100% aka 2x... That's still not a permanent solution. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:12:58
I believe you're referring to the mtgox rate. [btce is at 937](
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:08:00
I know it's not the market price, but did an actual trade take place at that value?

@_date: 2013-12-01 07:03:26
@_date: 2013-12-07 10:37:15
this is too good
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:23:35
1. Not bitter. 
2. Could give two fucks about karma. 
3. Posts like "BITCOIN DOWN 40% in 24 Hours" are not what I intended to replicate. 
4. Simply curious about why the market consistently crashes on days where a mere 80,000 BTC are transacted. With over 12 million in circulation, that seems like a very vulnerable market. I'm a huge fan of everything bitcoin has to offer, however this "chartist" indication seemed all too *obvious* not to mention. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:21:59
You're not alone in your thoughts, but be careful with "[Chartist]( tendencies. In total, there are around 12mm BTC in circulation. This has increased on a virtually linear scale, yet the price clearly hasn't. Here are a few [charts]( you may enjoy. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:52:34
Absolutely! I am trying to point out the fact that it seems to have cooled off and may not continue on such a steep upward slope. Do you think it will keep surging or plateau for awhile? After all, volatility is bad for a consumer friendly currency and that's what ultimately want out of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:05:21
Is there an underlying mathematic explanation to accompany this forecast?
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:24:12
My input: less is more. Some of these posts have good ideas at their core, but are at most, first drafts. One of the worst things we could do right now is associate bitcoin/reddit with a cheesy adspot. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:43:56
1024 mtgox
838 btce
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:06:48
mtgox: 1018
btce: 805
I wasn't far off.

After reading through some of the preliminary ideas, it seems this thread is need of the type of asset u/sickballs claims to be.
