I (mostly) agree with this. You (are the guy who gets his bitcoin by working for them, right? Working for bitcoins solves the problem of obtaining bitcoins without needing to go through a Fiat -&gt; Bitcoin exchange. There are also places to shop with Bitcoins, so there's no need to have a Bitcoin -&gt; Fiat exchange.
There's still one problem though: the volatility of Bitcoin relative to fiat. I can imagine many people use exchanges just to hedge against a big fall in the Bitcoin price. For people willing to accept the volatility, there's no problem. For others? There really should be some way to exchange the *volatility* -- and there should be a way to do this in a decentralized way -- and in a way that does not require ID. That is, a way that avoids KYC/AML requirements. Does anyone know a way to do this?

One way to avoid this issue is to have separate identities and separate wallets (sets of addresses) for each identity. For people who are OK with command line interfaces, the python code IDMAS helps with this:
When a particular identity boots up with Tails and wants to spend from their wallet, that identity can start Electrum and import the necessary private keys from that identity's wallet. Then only (some of) the addresses from that identity are correlated.
This is probably overkill for most people, but I've played with it and it seems to work.

Thanks, I'll look into this.
I still think it should be possible to exchange volatility in a decentralized way. After all, it's just some way of betting on the price -- so it seems to need something like a decentralized prediction market. I don't know how to create a decentralized prediction market, but it doesn't seem impossible.

If people want to use a mixer, they should use a mixer.
Even mixers have their privacy problems. You have to trust the mixer not to keep and share logs. There really should be some kind of mixer using Zero-Knowledge Proofs or Chaumian Blind Signatures.

ShapeShift is open about this. I'm amazed when I read people use them as a mixer.

Switzerland is not in the EU, right? There might still be agreements that mean Switzerland follows EU regulations. I don't know.
