I agree but still roger is so toxic to the enviroment now, and the games he places with stuff like his website being bitcoin.com but then giving you a bcash wallet and having noobs think its actual bitcoin and lose money

trying to figure what the importance of the notedef glyph overlapping the 7 in 257 is any hints
@_date: 2018-05-19 23:51:15
the number is a date
look to referneces bottom of white paper
@_date: 2018-05-20 00:50:38
what do you mean by the last part of that
@_date: 2018-05-20 01:06:06
look at the words at that angle that all have pairs
@_date: 2018-05-20 00:46:38
have a list of 13 words repeated twice, im sure its a 12 world seed. in satoshis white paper there are 12 sections which is refereed t in the first thing he said. he also keeps saying \+1 so maybe the 13th word witll help organize the other 12, idk could be way off
@_date: 2018-05-20 00:31:58
those numbers refer to dates

Steady interest scanning computational  0001 keys moving chronological representation telling group exists rather collectively instead greatest obviously ruin transfers
@_date: 2018-05-19 23:50:39
I believe its a 12 word seed

So with those you cam trade with miners directly and go through esgrow?

A system of debt in the way that, if i take out a loan from the bank they can magically make the money from free air. Instead of a set amount that cant be altered

They need to be shut down or go out of buisness. I hate that company so useless

Forget the price, people focus way to much on the price. Its about the average person using it and benefiting from it instead of being stuck in our current economic debt system. Stop always talking about the price and explain to new people the techincal side so they can understand the potential

Bitcoin has one thing that it all stands upon and thats its decentralization. With the miners and devs arguing over the right path, the average user has no real say. In satoshis white paper he says one cpu one vote but pretty much there is a small group of chinese guys who have much control
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:10:52
I mean it already has the lighting network and a strong team
@_date: 2017-07-07 20:20:48

Mining as well as transacting amd staking is what helps everyday

May have not directly opened the exchange with it but did use it to launder it
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:51:42
Ok good point
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:31:44
What point are you trying to make?
