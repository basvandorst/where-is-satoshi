Yeah I mean holding works in general but in order to maximize profits you can buy during dips and sell during a spike. 
If you had 100k in bitcoin on Dec 1 and and it was 19k 2 weeks later and you don't sell then yes you don't know anything about abnormal growth.
Do you not understand parabolic growth has to be answered by a correction? That's what has been causing the dips..... just look the dips... there is accelerated growth in constant ratios before every dip... lol this is basic trading

If you do the math when bitcoin hit 19k last month it was 10k to 19k in 2 weeks... that's 90% profit in TWO weeks. Anyone who bought at 10k and didn't sell at 19k is dumb. A correction was imminent and the subreddit was flooded with predictions of a correction.
Think of it in terms of percent growth and the pull backs are predictable. Growth will happen. The growth curve was arldy turning parabolic.

Coinbase to buy bitcoin with USD, you can lock in the price and use a credit card if u want.
GDAX to sell with the limit option and you can avoid fees. You can also send bitcoins for free with GDAX.
Use both.

Coinbase has had problems with that already. Just report it imo. They are making it a criminal offense to hide bitcoin for tax evasion. Some banks will freeze your account if you are dealing with cryptos like Bank of America (from what I've read).

When gdax goes down it's just bc there are high amounts of traffic that it's not designed to handle.. every single exchange will have problems during peak times.
Last time gdax went down this morning I couldn't open a new tab for gdax but my old tab had gdax open and it was just fine. It wasn't "down." There's just too many ppl trying to get thru the door at once. 
They aren't intentionally doing anything it's just ppl flooding the site during dips or spikes.. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:01:29
I don't think bitcoin has scaled yet--- use in commerce should be an issue but I think by the time it does scale the problem will have been solved.. I don't know... I tried the lightning network test today it was ok-- definitely faster and will probably be good for microtransactions and decongestion.

Anyone who feels edgy about bitcoin should read Andreas Antonopolous' book "Internet of Money". It will save you a lot of time researching and reading things that are repeated over and over in this subreddit/youtube. 
It will show you a window into the mind of a true visionary.
Even if bitcoin somehow fails, the technology is here to stay.. a future where bitcoin is a reliable international/borderless currency and other cryptocurrencies are credits used to serve other purposes/ecosystems.
After reading vol. 1, I've stopped caring about the price... because that's not what matters. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 14:45:13
but with bitcoin most ppl would hold their own instead of putting in on an exchange would they not ?
yea the video is a little preposterous.. but at the same time if we actually all hold our own money... doesn't it prevent the automatic process of loaning money and creating more out of interest (by banks)?
edit: banks just use our money to make money? with smart contracts, lenders could potentially lend money without using banks ?

How do I accept a payment over the internet without getting screwed over?
Paypal did a 2 month chargeback on an item I sold and wasted a lot of my time. My bank saved me and the buyer canceled the dispute but I'm still waiting on PayPal to fix the problem. 
I'd rather use the bitcoin network to accept large payments at this point.
I use GDAX and can just sell it after 6 confirmations w a stop limit right? Transfer to bank, back to slow cash but at least it won't go back unexpectedly to someone else's account.

@_date: 2018-03-01 10:39:52
I wouldn't say baseless. With bitcoin costing more electricity and processing power in the coming years to produce.. as well as the USD and other fiats inflating against btc... 50k by the end of 2020 looks more promising than mcafees 1million prediciton.. lol. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:05:29
Bitcoin gains value over time in the long term while Usd loses value. The trend seems to be that before every block reward halving (every 4 yrs), the price goes up then crashes. Just look at the purchasing power of usd since it came off the gold standard in the 70s. Look at the purchasing power of btc since 2009. If the trend continues it makes sense to invest a small amount in btc and see what happens in the long run. 
Practical use? I can send money with bitcoin to a family member in another country.. peer 2 peer. Didn't have to ask for permission. Didn't have to go through any banks.
Give a smart phone to a farmer in a 3rd world country. Now he has a bank account in his hand, and he can place an order online and get supplies shipped for his farm. He didn't have to use a bank that might have been corrupt or ask for permission.
Bitcoin was under attack last fall so transactions were slow. There have been a lot of changes since then, exchanges are batching and using segwit now. Try sending a transaction now and tell me how long it takes.
 
Bitcoin is faster than fiat. You can't argue against bitcoin traveling across the globe vs paper currency... sure the money shows up instantly in your account... but you realize that's credit right? There's a difference between available credit and current balance. The money still has to physically move from one account to another.... 
As a merchant I can use coinbase commerce to instantly convert btc into fiat when I receive it. No risk of volatility and I avoided the 2% fee (which could be like $2000 in savings depending on my credit sales).
I recommend taking time to listen to Andreas Antonopoulos and the lightning developers (like Elizabeth Stark).
Bitcoin could be the Napster...  but it could also be McDonald's/coke.

I'm not against hodling... but bitcoin is just speculative online gold right now. Also the miners deserve more recognition than hodlers. They are the ones that know the cost to actually produce one bitcoin. The miners with deep pockets are the ones creating a floor price by buying when it dips lower than its production cost. The floor price rises when more people hodl... but its use as a currency will create the demand it needs for a moonshot... more speculation and no use just means it will crash again after another spike. 
I want it to be digital currency that can be used in place of fiat cause I want a more efficient system ASAP. Super volatile speculative online gold is lame. That's not what Satoshi wanted. Buy and hodl is great but it only creates more speculation with inevitable panic sells because it's just in human nature to take profits. Did I get anything wrong?

Jokes aside, we should just talk about bitcoin more irl.
Educating ppl, family and friends will help spark more curiosity and most likely help push for more adoption.
I feel fine with this crash because I have done a lot of research and am confident in a recovery.
Most ppl out there haven't researched enough or don't have the time. Imagine being someone that doesn't understand the tech.. owning just a coinbase account and listening to and believing the everything the media says. I wish the mainstream media would shine some light on the developers &gt;.&gt;

Paying with your phone is faster than paying with plastic, but you're right... it's not much of a difference.
If I pay for something with bitcoin and don't receive the item, lightning can be the escrow... I can get my btc back. Lightning doesn't charge to be the middleman. When you use lightning the merchant won't receive payment until the item is received  and all conditions are met; if or else(both sides agreed to).

I think there is speculation and always will be with bitcoin simply because it is a rather new technology that most people will not or do not have the time to take to study it. This creates volatility and is good for experienced traders. However, I think people who invest in bitcoin not understanding the technology --thinking it is a quick rich scheme will lose money simply because of the fact that they don't realize it's a long term investment with short spikes and long downs-- they also believe in the fud and fear can spread like a wildfire.
People should use bitcoin as a long term store of value right now and push for adoption rather than just buying and holding--- hoping for the price to go up so they can sell at a profit while someone else is losing money due to the volatility.
@_date: 2018-03-25 00:13:15
True but that's where smart contracts come in right? Code that acts like an escrow. Two parties agree to set terms, assets are put in, specific conditions are met, and funds are released/returned? If, else; then:

I don't think the price of bitcoin is PURE 100% speculation.
You have the cost of processing power and electrical costs to produce 1.0 bitcoin. What are the costs to produce 1 dollar?
Then you have it's use as a currency, store of value, and the number of users on it's network.
Bitcoin could drop to $1.... but if I were a miner with deep pockets I'd just buy a bitcoin whenever it's value drops to or under the cost it takes to produce it.
Like in South Korea, where the price is way higher but the electrical costs are also way higher... correlation or not ? idk I'm still a newbie

hopefully we can get a bullrun with along with some more adoption and use as a currency not just pure speculation &gt;.&gt;

Lol yeah venmo or paypal really are the most convenient ways. Although paypal to my bank account would take a few days whereas I could take the bitcoin and sell it for cash on localbitcoins.
