It's merely my opinion based on watching network protocols being monetized for the past 20 years and on watching the rise of the cypherpunk ethic in the culture. Bitcoin is a culmination of a philosophy of technology and technology itself, much as the web was when the protocol was developed.
Stable and useful network protocols tend to grow slowly at first and then they explode. Bit torrent is a prime example.

Bitcoin's utility for moving money across the world will become more well-known and will rise in value as it's used. Bitcoin is a network protocol, like smtp and http. Those protocols were built and used by the technically proficient until being recognized by the larger culture and we see where that's taken us. 
I think the next year or two will be interesting ones for those people that have btc now.

I read and dismissed Ayn Rand in the late 1970's. She codified and packaged selfishness and boorishness in such a nice way that it resonated with selfish boors. I've always preferred the enlightened thinking of Montesquieu, Mill and even the Buddha to the Rand's bitter hissings.

I'm sure many are. I'm also sure many are not. Bitcoin hasn't hit mass appeal yet, but it will. 
Here's my reasoning: the two main protocols in use by the masses are smtp (email) and http (web). They became monetized when a critical mass of people learned about them. But for years, smtp was  developed and used exclusively by geeks. http broke out more quickly than smtp did (a shorter time between development and mass acceptance) but was, in the beginning, also geeks playground. Now look where it all is.
Bitcoin is a network protocol designed to be monetized. Or it's money designed to be a network protocol. But I think it will follow the same path that the other protocols have followed. 
If you don't have bitcoins now, they'll be harder to get soon.

This is the revolutionary thing about bitcoin, you're absolutely correct. I'd never thought of using the blockchain for voting purposes. That's brilliant. It made me go look and there's a proof of concept for something along your line of thought:
I think bitcoin itself will play some part in whatever the world economy reorganizes itself as after the next Black Swan flies away, but your bigger point, if I understand you correctly, is taken. We have a new material from which to make our models now rather than having to work with the slag we almost inherited.

I think we're looking at the near-real price and I expect it will go up. Bitcoin production will be halved in December, so the price will rise if demand increases but supply drops.
All the people that had been collecting bitcoins for a couple of years made their money last year: that was the bubble. Bitcoins are now being used, hence the rise in price after the doldrums. They have utility now.
