How will it only take 2 weeks to pay the loan? CryptX is still using the reinvestment as reinvestment, this is not used to pay back the loan. The dividend is the only thing used to repay the loans and in CryptX's forecast you can see the first 20 days dividend is only a total of 123.9 BTC. 
If he used 100% of reinvestment and dividends to pay back the loan then you would be correct, but this is not what is happening.
Edit: Of course this is assuming that you were talking about my worst case scenario. The best case scenario has no loan to repay because the IPO takes care of it 100%

This could be an attack route but not directly. Many websites display an account owner's age but that site itself will not allow a reset with that information. The email address through GMX was the one that allowed it when there is no way to see this information publicly. But if you know an account owner's email address and a forum account owned by that email address and if they used the same birth date, which most people do, then yes it's that easy.
Not saying that's what happened. If it was then it's a surprise the account wasn't compromised a long time ago.

Pretty much stay under $1,000 per day and $10,000 per month. If at anytime they say they will use the coins for drugs refuse to sell. Of course you should look more into the law and this is just from skimming regulations / experience as a seller.
About those Florida guys, if I remember the article correctly it was over $30,000 and the guy sold even after being told the coins would be used for drugs. Just back out of the trade if drugs are mentioned at all.

Before anyone buys this new IPO you should know what has changed with PETA.
1. No longer is the division 35% reinvestment 65% dividend. CryptX is in debt after buying an additional 1000 TH/s and changed the terms to all dividends paying back this debt. The current split is 90% reinvestment 10% dividend being withheld to pay back this debt. Every 10 days the reinvestment goes down by ~3% down to a 1% decrease in reinvestment funds a year out from now.
2. IPO is being used to pay back this debt and the sale of IPO will not generate any additional hashing power.
3. Hosting fee is reduced from $0.45/kwh down to $0.25/kwh.
CryptX has his forecast out and it assumes a linear network hashrate growth of 6 ph/s every 10 days for a year.
The best case scenario given CryptX's own forecast will see a 100% ROI after 1 year + 100 days.
Worst case scenario which can be seen in his forecast will not pay out any dividends to shareholders until 13 weeks in, that is when the full amount of the debt will be paid back.
Now that those scenarios are out there given CryptX's own forecast you must also look at when this mine starts to become unsustainable and that date is August 4, 2014. That is the date where we start to see the estimated BTC mined start on a downtrend even with the 90% reinvestment fee at the start.
Don't just take what I said for fact, do your own research and run your own scenarios with a more realistic difficulty rise. Plus his reinvestment assume deliveries at least every 10 days and we all know mining companies never get those on time. Petamine couldn't even deliver the original hashrate they promised when the mine started.
Edit: In the best case scenario the 100% ROI is based off of the new IPO price of .095 BTC / share, it assumes all 33k shares are sold, so the last 23k shares will not see the ROI at that time.
Edit 2: The wording seemed confusing in the first bullet so I made it a bit easier to understand.

On p2pfoundation the birth date is either 1974 (Jan 1 - September 8) or 1975 (September 9 - December 31), so that narrows it down. Watching when it changed from 38-39 would have given the exact date.

Look at the spreadsheet in that comment, if the reinvestment is to be used for paying back the loan then there would be a 0 in the reinvestment TH/s column. How could CryptX possibly reinvest funds if they all go to paying back the loan like Gaby_64 claims? CryptX never says the reinvestment is used to pay back the loan where you linked anyways.

When you send coin to somebody the remainder is sent to a change address. So even if you buy a $5 coffee you will have a transaction for the entire amount of your wallet on the blockchain...does this mean we technically have to report every single transaction if you keep a balance over $600?

Are you able to move your funds around within Coinbase wallets to bypass this daily limit? IE make a multisig vault address to send your coins to then use your user key to withdraw all coins? Or maybe if you're buying coins before August have them sent directly to the vault address. If you don't want to take your coins out of coinbase, could you just store them in the multisig vault and use the shared/user keys whenever you want to sign for both versions of Bitcoin?
I don't use Coinbase so I don't know if this would work.

Any person who has Bitcoins, uses Bitcoin or trades Bitcoin. A user in my mind can be a holder from years ago, including Satoshi, to the guy that only uses it as a means of trade, never holding for more than an hour.

@_date: 2015-02-14 13:15:19
I'm aware of that, but the amount of people holding in Coinbase / exchanges and the amount that have multiple 2+ BTC addresses could even out to the same estimate of just 2+ BTC addresses. I would think that estimate could be accurate based on that.
I personally don't think the amount of users very large and am just looking to see what others think.

I'm a user of Mycelium and I love the app. It's my first wallet that I actively use since QT and I'm like the HD wallets it has. I have the most trades in my area and I only get an offer once every couple months, doesn't seem like many use the local trader portion of Mycelium yet.
That sure is a lot of accounts, but I contribute to the skewing of graphs and I'm sure others do as well. I hold about 10 accounts on blockchain.info and 3 on Coinbase. All of which are inactive since 2013.

With so few users owning such a large portion it seems like the potential for growth/failure is large. From the post a few days ago with only ~230k addresses with 2+ BTC the 200k-400k users seems reasonable. I just wish there were more users but it only became "easy" to buy Bitcoin in late 2012-2013.

Getting into Bitcoin does suck in the US. If it wasn't for Bitfloor I wouldn't own any coins today, their anonymous deposit into their bank account with no verification required was the best thing ever. I didn't even really care about being anonymous, it was the ease of the transaction and how I was funded within 20 minutes of deposit which did the trick.  I hate these regulations we need to follow.

One game does not affect the outcome of another game, with every game you have a 51% chance of losing. You are at a disadvantage from the first game and the odds never change. Using your 49% / 51% example it is a 2% house edge. On the first game you can clearly see it is a 2% house advantage, so on the second game it is independent from the first and remains a 2% house edge. If it changed then it would no longer be a 2% house edge and the win/loss would no longer be 49% / 51%.
Now let's do it with math:
    1 game: 2 outcomes (w)(l) 49%, 51%
    2 games: 4 outcomes (w,w)(w,l)(l,w)(l,l) (49%,49%)(49%,51%)(51%,49)(51%,51%) = (24%)(25%)(25%)(26%)
In the 2 game example the 2 middle options are break even so we throw out both 25% options and we are left with a 2% advantage to the 2 losses in a row. This is the exact same house edge as the first game. Just learn some statistics before you preach statistics.
