Sweet, I'll add it myself and hopefully, I'll be adding a few of neighboring merchants as well. I'll probably show them your comment, too, as proof that it'll be good for business.

Ha. I don't have any fun images in mind atm. 
The [standard graphic]( should get the job done.
Public address is:
Can you use that to find the QR?

That's actually exactly what I had in mind. Thanks!

Cool! Will do.

Hi back at you! Are you still in the neighborhood?
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:57:49
I'll check you out tomorrow..maybe you'll ave some NYC customers... 
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:32:31
Thanks. I actually have a personal coinbase account and wasn't aware until you prompted me to search that it had public addresses attached to it. Nice.
Should I just reply to this thread with the image and public address?
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:56:50
Will do.

Thanks! We're actually a tutoring business, so unless you're super local and have kids, we're probably not that interesting to you. But appreciate you supporting BTC businesses! And yeah, will be adding us on coinmap shortly.
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:09:35
Yeah that's pretty solid, thanks for the help! Will take you up on the offer. I'm in the process of creating a Blockchain Wallet (which I'm pretty sure will generate a public address, no?).

Good question. I think the top reply in that post was right. Anyway, I'm gonna punt because I don't anticipate any refunds or returns.

Sweet, thanks! "We exchange B's for A's" :D
