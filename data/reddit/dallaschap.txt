That's what I did.  I bought at 800-something, but now my 'average buy price' is around $390, which I've been pretty happy with.  It's been a pretty wild ride this past year, so I think I'm just going to hold for now and re-evaluate in a year or so.
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:41:44
In the grand scheme of things, I feel like getting to the front page today isn't going to change much.  One of the major concerns of bitcoin is its volatility, and this past week just re-enforces the idea that it is a highly volatile (i.e. risky) currency.
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:04:16
No one can predict the future, but I would say no. This questions gets asked every time there is a huge spike. With that said, Bitcoin is extremely volitale and risky, so only invest what you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:52:32
This is where we finally surpass $3,000 USD.  I can feel it.
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:09:08
Nice! I may start doing that again sometime down the line. At the moment, I'm working on diversifying a bit, so any extra cash I have goes elsewhere. Perhaps I'll regret it when Bitcoin hits the moon, but better to be safe than sorry.
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:20:34
I have a few litecoin as well. Stability isn't necessarily a bad thing. I'd love to see LTC go to the moon as well, but, at the same time, I think the volitilaty needs to stop in order for these crypto currencies to be taken serious as a currency and not an investment.
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:07:05
Perhaps now that August 1st has passed, more people are regaining confidence in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:02:07
Everyone has to start somewhere. Some people are intimidated by the high price and think they need to buy "whole amounts", but people forget you can buy 0.0001 BTC today and just work your way up to a higher amount in the future.
@_date: 2016-11-01 19:38:56
I'd be okay with slow growth.  It wasn't too long ago that we were hovering around the $200s for quite sometime.
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:00:00
Probably this. There was a lot of uncertainty leading up to August 1st, which probably made people hesitant to buy Bitcoin. I believe some of the altcoins really shot up in value over the past few months, and part of it was probably because of bitcoins uncertainty. Good news is, it looks like that's all behind us now.
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:57:42
That's my plan as well. HODL until I can buy a house. I could speed up the process by continuing to invest more now, but I think I'm just going to stick with what I have and ride this out. If, for some reason, Bitcoin ends up losing all value and is worthless, I'd be totally okay with my losses and would have enjoyed the ride there.
@_date: 2017-08-31 06:55:08
I'd imagine, as time goes on, more and more places will allow you to pay directly via BTC, so you could just spend the BTC rather than convert back to fiat and get taxed.
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:04:22
Pretty much. It's sad because I'm from the US and am on vacation in Morocco, but find myself checking my phone whenever I have access to WiFi. I should be trying to enjoy my vacation as much as possible, but this is too good to be true. Originally I said I wouldn't check it until I got back, but that last all of two days.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:53:43
True, but aren't Credit Cards still safer?  At a restaurant, I'm pretty sure they do a pre-authorization of the transaction to ask if they are good for the money.  I'm pretty sure if someone's credit card couldn't front the money, it would decline on the spot.  Obviously there is some risk in there, because sometimes cards do get approved, but the actual payment never goes through, but I still think credit cards are safer for merchants.
@_date: 2016-02-09 05:52:08
Definitely agree.  Not to generalize, but (as a gamer) I feel like gamers would, in general, be more receptive to new technology like bitcoin versus the general masses.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:28:47


Lol, true.  That's not me, but I do see some newbies who are really intimidated by it all, so they just go in with a small amount.  Eventually that amount might grow.
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:47:17
I guess this is also way it's important to invest only what you are willing to lose.  If you invest money that you might need later, then you're more likely to cash out sooner than expected.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:29:19


I don't understand.  Why would it be 100,000 euros?  To be in the one million club, you need to own 1/1,000,000 club.  This isn't an American trying to be arbitrary with their numbers, it's just that 1/1,000,000 of all bitcoin is 21 bitcoins.  Currently that costs $115,000, but next month it could cost more or less.
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:10:55


So true.  At this point, Bitcoin is way too big for one CEO to take it down.  Maybe 4-5 years ago, the currency was fragile enough to where the comments of one individual could kill it completely, but not now.  It's way too popular and influenced way too many people.  Not to mention he exactly unbiased on the situation.
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:08:48
Lol.. Am I stupid?  Was this just a joke that totally went over my head then?
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:10:41
It depends on how much you've invested into crypto, though.  Some people only buy $10-$50 just to start with, and, if so, a $70 wallet makes no sense. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 01:02:15


No doubt.  Sorry, I didn't mean to point the finger at you or anything.  Your post gave good advice to all newcomers, so I was just taking on to that advice.
But yeah, totally know what you mean.  Life is unpredictable, and, while I have been holding on to my BTC since I bought it, there was a time in college where I sold a bunch of shares of some stocks I had for some quick cash.  I was young and money wasn't as easy to come by, so, at the time it made sense.  Like you said, shit happens, but all you can do is learn from it. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:45:37
You're not wrong, but at the same time, I'm glad Coinbase exists.  It's a great 'gateway' exchange to get new people on board with bitcoin.  Nobody is forced to use Coinbase, so everyone has options, but it's great to know there is an option for those who want something as simple as possible as well.
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:04:45
At first, I was pretty good about not checking all the time, but this past month or so has just been insane, so I find myself checking a few times a day.
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:47:12
Everyone was just commenting so seriously in a non-joking manner, so I figured it wasn't a joke..hah.
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:00:31
I know bitcoins aren't supposed to be an investment, but, after so long, I've finally started to profit off my 3.11 BTC.  My break even point was about $390, so now I'll just (hopefully) watch it continue to soar.
I don't really need the money I invested, so perhaps I'll just go for the long haul and see how high this thing can really go.
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:28:29
Haha, further proof that I have no idea what is going on around here.
Did not expect my post to blow up like this though.  I do realize I can quickly google all of this stuff, I just haven't taken the time to, and I figured there would be other people on this sub who are just like me.  I'm a long time 'HODL'er and just pop in from time to time to check the price, although I would like to know more about bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general.
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:52:22
Got it, that makes more sense.  I'm not really interesting in using my wallet.  I'm in it to 'HODL', as they say.
So I'll definitely put the seed in a deposit box.  I may also keep my trezor in a separate box, but who knows.
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:04:29
So if I left it on the ground or lost it, I'd require the recovery seed to access my bitcoin?
I guess I don't entirely trust myself to hang on to it for so long.  Not that I'm unreliable, it's just a scary thought.
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:15:17
What's stopping you?  It's not like you have to buy one whole bitcoin at once.  Even just $50 worth of BTC here and there would add up in the end.
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:27:55
Already have.  I started with BTC years ago, but recently decided to diversify and am also now (as of a week ago) also dipping my hands in LTC and ETH.  I still know next to nothing, but I believe cryptocurrency is the future, and it certainly doesn't hurt to diversify yourself a bit.
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:36:56
You're absolutely right.  There are pros and cons to both.
For me, personally, I would have probably paid for most, if not all of the house as well.  Maybe I'd keep a few in BTC, in case it continues to climb to crazy values, but having a house paid outright would make me feel better about making more risky investments in the future.  Right now, my mortgage is the one thing that prevents me from buying more BTC.  If my house had been paid off, I'd be more willing to take a risk and buy more BTC, or invest in other risky ventures.
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:06:15
Checking the price is fine if you have self control.  I guess the advice is for people who are likely to panic sell if the price drops, or perhaps sell too early if there is a small bump in price.
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:55:01
Thanks for the advice.  To answer your question, yes the booklet basically says 'TOP SECRET!' on it..hah.
I might end up getting two separate boxes (at two different banks) and storing the trezor in one and the key in the other.
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:59:48
Is anyone here diversifying with their cryptocurrency investing?  I think I'm about done with bitcoin.  I'm hopeful it will continue to rise, but I'd rather be safe and just 'HODL' with the amount I have.
I'm now eyeing LTC and ETH, though.  Does anything think only one currency will rule them all, or is it possible that multiple currencies can co-exist?
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:38:51
Hah, got it.  I guess I don't quite understand offline storage just yet.
If someone got a hold of JUST the recovery seed, would they have access to my bitcoin?  If that's the case, I'd feel safe with the recovery seed and Trezor all together in a safety deposit box, instead of in my house.  (FYI, I'm talking about renting a safety deposit box in a bank, not something I keep at home).
@_date: 2017-07-14 06:59:48
Was that when the price basically hovered around $200 for a long time?  I can't remember the specific time period, I just remember buying at about $800, then watching it drop to $200 and stay there for quite some time.
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:41:50


It's certainly nice being debt free, but, let's say instead of putting the full $75K into a house, you only put 20% down ($15K).  Now you have any extra $60K to do whatever you choose.  Put it in stocks and, over the next 30 years, you'll probably average a return of around 6-8%, which is quite a bit more than you will pay in interest on your mortgage.
With that said, congrats OP!  I'm nowhere near having enough BTC to buy a house, but I do hope to one day be able to buy a house with my bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:58:14
Yeah, I once bought when it was ~$800 and remembered when it dropped to $200.  It hovered around $200 for a long time, and the entire time I was skeptical it would recover.  Man it would have been nice to double down at that price.
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:29:31
I figured this was the case.  Once my bitcoin is offline, I'm not too worried about hacking.  I suppose I'm just worried about something happening to my house or getting robbed.  Highly unlikely, but a safety deposit box would put my mind at ease a bit.
Does it make sense to put the Trezor and Recovery seeds in different locations?  Maybe two different safety deposit boxes?

Here's a lazy one I just made:
@_date: 2017-06-05 23:53:13
In the grand scheme of things, bitcoin isn't even that widely used.  Yes it's the clear front runner when compared to the rest of the cryptocurrencies, but, if I had to guess, less than 1% of the world even knows about bitcoin and a significantly less amount of people actually use it.  I completely made up those numbers, but you get my point.  There is a lot of untapped potential left, and it is anyone's for the taking.  I honestly don't know the differences or pros/cons of each cryptocurrency, but perhaps it's plausible for more than one to be a success.
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:31:13
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.  Sure there was a huge drop, but it's bouncing back very fast.  I feel like the price drop was a combination of price correction and panic selling, and, it got too low, which lead to a buy of people buying more on the 'cheap' which drove the price back up.  If the price gets pushed up too high, it could start this cycle all over again with people panic selling, etc..
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:24:43
I have no doubt that this will be the case, but there are a lot of us who are long term 'HODL'ers, that will lose out if another currency takes over.
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:36:53
She was way cooler in her pre-teen days.
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:59:51
Yes, Dad.
@_date: 2017-06-07 06:18:50
I hope so.  I figure cryptocurrency is most definitely is the future, but which of the currencies will come out on top is still up in the air, which is why I invested in the top three front runners.
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:50:35
I've just recently invested in ETH and LTC.  Might as well diversify, especially since the prices of the other currencies are so low.
