For real I feel  like I've learned a lot from your reply. Very informative!
@_date: 2014-09-18 06:29:27
Same here brother.
@_date: 2014-05-24 06:51:17
Lol I thought that was a typo.
@_date: 2014-10-13 15:32:00
Thank you so much!
@_date: 2014-10-13 17:46:25
Thank you. I can't wait to spread the love.
@_date: 2014-03-07 10:13:11
Same! I had 2 BTC, but I lost them last year...
@_date: 2014-10-13 16:59:46
You guys are freakin awesome.
@_date: 2014-09-18 06:30:08
What I need is a simple way to get bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-29 03:34:59
Good job dude!
@_date: 2016-11-13 03:04:42
Damn. I probably would have blown it on the wrong things anyway. Just sucks that those coins will never be able to be spent by anybody. 950 bits @_date: 2016-11-13 02:22:08
I'm not sure how much would $700 in bitcoin around April 2013 be worth now?
@_date: 2016-11-12 23:45:28
I wasn't worried much about Blockchain not being secure, I just really like the Mycelium app. I just ended up moving all my coins to my Mycelium HD Account, created a new address on Blockchain, and archived my old default one. 
Probably didn't need to go through all that trouble but oh well.
I'm more worried about losing my private key's and backups than I am of someone stealing my coins. I'm fairly certain I have 2 or 3 addresses out there from early 2014 with ~1-2 Bitcoin :\
950 bits @_date: 2016-11-13 03:05:09
I will give it a shot. 950 bits @_date: 2016-11-13 00:17:51
Thanks man I'll be sure to have a cold one tonight!
@_date: 2016-11-13 00:23:05
Yes but then [This]( comes up and I do not remember what password I used because I was a dumb noob and made it a long string of characters, letters, and numbers and didn't save it. I've just chalked it up to a lesson learned.

I do to an extent. I dabbled with it right before Ross went down. Back when someone tipped me 2700 mBTC, which would now be worth almost 2 grand if I did my math right.
I know PGP, 2FA, paper wallets, and all that jazz, Blockchains Web layout was just confusing to me. I understand where you're coming from though. I will definitely be doing some homework!
@_date: 2016-11-12 21:20:54
No problem man! It's a good thing I only had $5 haha I'd tip everyone in til I was broke.
@_date: 2016-11-12 18:52:26
Transfered it from circle to blockchain. Figured the minors deserved that 7 cent fee lol. But I would really like to use mycelium,  is there any way to transfer money between my own addresses with no fee?

As much as I would have loved to invest more, I still gotta keep food on the table for me and the wife.

No luck. I uploaded the .json to my google drive and made a public link if anyone else wants to have a crack at it. (Not really sure what anyone could do with it though) but I'm not sure where I can share the link.
@_date: 2016-11-12 19:50:50
I also have two backup Blockchain wallets like this from 2 years ago that I have no way of recovering: wallet-2014-10-06.aes.json :(
@_date: 2016-11-13 03:42:03
Haha I started off with $5 this morning I haven't bought any more. Still have like $3 I think.
950 bits @_date: 2016-11-12 23:40:20
Will check that out! 950 bits @_date: 2016-11-12 20:09:00
Oh I understand Blockchain is a privately owned and I will not be keeping any coin on there. I will be transfering everything over to a paper wallet and a laptop running Tails with absolutely no access to the outside world. Not that I have much to worry about I could only afford that $5 in coin. 950 bits @_date: 2016-11-12 19:02:28
Would my private key be my wallet identifier? Sorry, I know there's posts/tutorials on this but I enjoy actually talking to someone about this fascinating stuff.
@_date: 2016-11-12 20:01:57
Appreciate you guys! 950 bits Hopefully this works right.
@_date: 2016-05-21 05:55:27
Yeah I was the only one to see it, I could have pocketed it and not said a word and been $7k richer, but the thought never even crossed my mind.
 I wasn't actually expecting anything in return, hell I probably wouldn't have let her give me anything anyway.
I like helping people and making peoples lives better, so I did get something out of it that day.
@_date: 2016-05-21 05:50:33
Lmao I could have just kept the damn envelope and told no one. Got a soft spot for little old people though.
@_date: 2016-05-21 02:24:05
I found $7k in an envelope that an old lady had dropped at Applebee's. 
I ran out to the parking lot, jumped in front of her car as she was pulling out, gave her the envelope, and received nothing :(
