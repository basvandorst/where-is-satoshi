Market price movements cannot be predicted
There is no way to say how high/low the price will go, if that was possible most traders will make money, instead of losing it (something like 90% of all individual traders and over 50% of hedge funds are on the losing side, historically).

I don't have time to look up all the stats now, but it's something I read over the years (I am one of those unfortunate "individual" stock/futures traders).
Bottom line, you cannot predict highs/lows or future prices, period. It can't be done with any degree of certainty. It goes double for bitcoin unregulated markets, because god knows what is going on behind the scenes. At least with normal regulated stock markets you have most of the information made public - financial statements, annual results, etc, which can be used for fundamental analysis and long term investing.
Bitcoin is pure speculation.

Mostly hookers who accept payments in Bitcoin I guess ...

This. Anyone who intends to trade/invest in any markets should have this tattooed on their forehead, like amnesia guy in "Memento", before they make the first ever trade.

So... If I follow Bill Gates with a box of kleenex I can become a rich man?

It means do not try to average your losses down. It's a typical mistake that most new traders make. Market can remain irrational a lot longer than you can stay solvent.

Yes, because sacrificing couple of % in exchange fees is a lot worse than losing 15-20% of value when bitcoin crashes 5 hours later, after transaction had been completed. /s
