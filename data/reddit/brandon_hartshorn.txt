This is what I said to myself in the mirror for months when I invested at $900 and not $50. How did you know?

Mate I didn't think you could get a perfect 100 on an IQ test? So 97 is seriously up there

Bitcon is definitely funny stuff. Knock knock jokes are also funny stuff. Here are some good ones:

The full story:
I invested in Bitcoin at the end of 2016, times were good. As the price began to go up my friends would ask a lot of questions about what Bitcoin was and how it worked. I answered honestly, not trying to sway either way. At the end of last year at the peak of its upwards curve one of my close friend decided he had to get in the game, and took at a $7,000 low interest government university loan to buy Bitcoin, thinking the price would soon be over six figures. Well that was a great fucking idea wasn't it.
Dreaming of getting rich quick, and DEFINITELY investing more than he could lose it was obviously a recipe for disaster. I must say it is mildly amusing that the government now has him by the balls because of a completely unregulated cryptocurrency..
Price drops, he loses two thirds of his investment, and now blames me solely for losing that money on Bitcoin.
What did I do?
I was so fed up with his whinging on our group chat of friends, that I created a card game one night called 'Bitcon' to simulate losing your money investing in crypto. I took it to uni saying now he could lose his money with out actually losing his money.
One of our friends (a graphic designer/videographer) loved the idea and offered to help me actually make it into a game. I jumped at the chance to keep the prank going longer. We designed the cards, created graphics and a cool video, and this morning launched the game on Kickstarter. The first person I messaged? The original idiot still crying about losing his cash.
Not sure how to keep the prank going on any longer (all suggestions welcome)
