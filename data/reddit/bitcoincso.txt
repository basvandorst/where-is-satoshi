Storing your keys encrypted is the best method be it a OTP, GPG, or BIP-38 encrypted key. Storing seeds is always better than storing individual xprivs or private keys. This ensures if your storage location is compromised or raided that they key is not exposed.
  
RE: Multisig - One thing to consider is the level of technical acumen in your family. Will they be able to jump through all the hoops to restore a private key in wallet software that you don’t know will support it in the future?  Inputting a password and then 12 or 24 seed words is something I feel my family could achieve based off instructions I left in a will or otherwise. If my mother for example had to figure out what to with 1hen7hdve... then she would just find the nearest “computer person” and watch them as they stole your life’s savings.
  
Keep it safe, keep it simple, keep it redundant, keep it secure. There is a way to achieve all 4.

Breaking up a secret is always worse than encrypting a secret. What happens if one of the 4 locations burns down, or you part of the 3rd copy gets wet or is illegible? You could more easily brute force it with 3 of 4 parts, but I’d much rather have two copies of encrypted seed words in two separate secure access controlled locations. If one burns up, I still have the other.

As the CSO of Bitcoin I congratulate you on your future purchase, and provide you with this quick security reminder -- now is a great time to enable two factor authentication (2FA)!

Thank you!

Are you copying and pasting?  Try typing the "[', characters by hand.  I've had that issue in the console before when using reference examples.

There are some risks but not ones you’d likely expect:
  
* Not updating firmware over time could cause an issue if there’s cascading or conflicting updates that make major revisions to the device. Think of it as upgrading from Windows 95 to Windows 10 as opposed to upgrading from Windows 8 to 10. 
* Software and hardware exploits could affect the device if someone obtained physical control. Updates help fix bugs, glitches, and security vulnerabilities.
* The device may not power on.
* The tech could become deprecated over time (USB-A vs USB-C). Hardware wallets are notorious for being picky about cables and adapters.
  
The solution to mitigate your risk to the above is to ensure your seed words are backed up properly and securely in a separate access controlled location.
