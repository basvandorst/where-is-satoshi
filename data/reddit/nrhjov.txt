Don't beat yourself up. Just hold on to it. Don't sell it rn thinking you'll at least make some of it back. This is an investment with risks. This happens.

USD dude.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:20:09
give the subreddit your bitcoin~
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:00:58
Giving it a try! +1 Because their website had a funny explanation on why it's better than G2FA
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:50:05
I appreciate the info! I didn't notice any offline codes but that could be my own ignorance. I'll do some investigating on the sites I use.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:59:34
I watched it go under 20%... I tried to buy but CoinBase was not responsive... It's coming back up to 17000.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:20:42
Dang I really hope so because I'm looking at $12,750 at the moment and I just bought at $18,000 a few days ago
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:55:42
What I found is that sites like Coinbase can regen your secret key (what I need to write down somewhere safe) and if anything I can just go through the sites I use and restart the 2FA while making sure I grab the secret key.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:48:15
Why didn't you just transfer your BTC out of coinbase? I don't think BTC will go much lower.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:08:43
Yea I don't even know how I got BCH but I was credited a little bit. Going to sell it for BTC proper.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:34:28
I'm trying to buy it at 15,500. It got close for a bit but now is coming back up. Self control is playing a large role here
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:54:08
this is actually me tho
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:10:31
yeah same here. Honestly we should stop trying to connect bec it's impatient people like us that make it worse haha
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:24:19
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:15:28
This only works as long as people are buying BCH. Rn it's pretty much dead on arrival.
@_date: 2018-03-07 05:06:53
I prefer Sentinal! I use it to watch paper wallets I gifted to friends last christmas haha
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:19:09
I talked to Samourai support yesterday and they said try using a larger tx fee. Today I continued the support conversation and they said just wait it out. Is this normal? To not even see them in the mempool? It's not like I send Bitcoin around often but in the last couple years I haven't had this happen before. (Not being able to track a transaction by id)
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:09:25
First transaction from 24 hours ago(low fee)
Recent transaction 12 hours ago (100 sat/b)
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:53:01
Tried restarting app, phone, uninstalling Samourai, restored wallet and nothing of note. I'll just put it to the side hope it solves itself on Sunday. Thanks for helping me out!
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:32:24
Exactly haha!
@_date: 2018-03-01 06:02:32
Search for Cash App. It should be by Square. My girlfriend has it on her iPhone. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:49:34
I use both Coinbase and Samourai Wallet! 
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:51:43
What should I do? I've already tried increasing the tx and I researched a bit about the settings available in the app. 
This is a new wallet so not much in it, should I transfer in some more Bitcoin to help it get unstuck? 
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:25:32
We actually don't know that it will rise. We honestly can't predict if it'll be worth 1k or 100k. They're selling because they don't want to lose as much as they would if they sell later when it's lower. They don't know* if it's going up or down.
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:06:40
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:57:16
I think it does, probably more so because like OP I didn't put down over a grand into trading so this is more relatable to me.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:28:50
This looks good! I'll still keep some bits handy in my samourai wallet though (: loving these low fees
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:53:05
I've been using Square Cash as a way to transfer money between cards at a low fee so I've had a few years of experience with em. I like em, haven't used their Cash Card but when I first saw the Bitcoin option in my app I went in and bought a dollar just to test it out. I think my account was already verified but it it appeared after 2 days of me not looking at it. It was very easy to get Bitcoin but I don't see an option to send/transfer. Only sell for a hopeful profit.
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:21:04
Samourai wallet on Android! 
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:33:23
You can withdraw! You just need to be verified. Check out your profile settings and click on Bitcoin. On the bottom you'll see a verification link.
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:23:49
UIUC has one I believe. I remember seeing it but don't know if it's still there. The restaurant now named Taipei Cafe changed ownership and that's where I saw. I don't know any stores here that accept it tho. I intern at a marketing company here and maybe I can get some stores to start looking into it.
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:13:25
Yeah I found that out too! I got verified after a week and a half I think? Weird thing is I invited a friend to use square cash but they don't have any options or prompts for Bitcoin. Not sure why, and I guess there's no way to send Bitcoin from cash wallet to cash wallet. Only buy,sell, withdraw. But it's still the fastest and simplest way to buy Bitcoin. Coinbase takes forever and other solutions feel either sketchy or require too many steps.
@_date: 2018-02-20 05:20:09
Hey check out Square Cash. Maybe they let you use a prepaid Visa to buy Bitcoin. If you plan to register DM me so I can pass my invite code ��
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:46:40
If you're non crypto friend has already used Square Cash and is verified it can be easy to send someone Bitcoin. It's not a full wallet but has an easy Buy, Sell, and Widthdraw to Wallet. Can take a week to be verified though.
@_date: 2018-02-25 03:20:14
I have two transactions stuck for over 28 hours too! The first was at 1 sat/b the second at 104 sat/b I think the first one is preventing the other from clearing. The issue too is my tx isn't even in the mempool. I can't see it in any block explorer.
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:58:21
Can't. Tells me it can't make a cpfp transaction error.
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:24:56
As a college kid I didn't spend my refunds on Bitcoin but used it to buy other stuff like a laptop and a camera haha
