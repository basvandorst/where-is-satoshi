Could the coin be double spent if it was first sent with a low fee and later (but before confirmed) sent with a high fee?

You spend deflating currency when you spend your time.
Your macro economic observations have an underlying assumption that the dollar is a valid reference point for value. The sub prime mortgage crisis was caused by the same government that stepped in to 'fix' it. What was their fix? Inflation through quantitative easing.
Inflation statistics are manipulated 
So, yes I strongly agree that there is incentive to spend an inflating currency and hold a deflating one. But that's literally the same statement as saying that you would want to hold an asset that increases in value and sell one that decreases. 
You can sit still in a car, but you're still moving. You can lay still on your bed, but the Earth is still spinning. It's all about your reference. The dollar isn't constant.

Who's going to show up to the magic company and not get paid? How's the magic company going to order from it's suppliers who can't get paid?

That's an interesting strategy. Since Bitcoin is being used for speculative trading rather than currency, people will accept larger transaction fees.

The premise of Bitcoin is that a majority of nodes are honest. I'd say that the hardware and electricity cost cause consolidation of nodes.
The difficulty needs to stay up and the nodes need to stay diverse. If one pool controls a significant portion of the network, the chain could be hijacked.

That's why I used the Earth analogy. 
It depends on what your goals are. If your goal is retirement, you want a store of wealth that gives you the proper amount of buying power, regardless of what numbers are associated with it. 
I'm not aware of a deflationary asset/currency that has the same properties as crypto. I'm not convinced that the same paradigms apply

I want to see someone take a worn out electric car, outfit it with mining rigs and heat exchangers, and leave it plugged into the free charging station where there's also free wifi

I'm thinking like salvaged plug in Prius. Or better yet, just put a battery charger on an old suburban and call it a hybrid haha

You're swapping consumers and producers here. When the F500 companies are consumers, they have the power of choice. 
Driving the price of a speculative market is not control either. It's not a necessary good. Others can choose not to purchase. 
If it is a non speculative market (the price is up due to legitimate demand,) that's the market working to inventivize more resources to meet demand.
Having "all the money" doesn't prevent new suppliers from entering. It encourages new suppliers which counteracts higher prices. If supply can't keep up, then the price is justified. If only large firms can pay, then it's likely minupliated economies of scale by government.




Addictive does not equal control. There's a huge difference between paying taxes and Facebook. It's a subtle difference until you recognize it. No one throws you in jail if you don't use Facebook. It's an internal motivation to take the action of participating in social media. You ultimately own the action. No one is forcing you. With taxes, you are compelled by what others will do to you if you choose not to. 
I guess if you truly believe that addicts aren't responsible for their actions, you'll take exception. But short of that, influence is not control.

Shhhh facts and actual financial analysis have no place here

When regulation is used to put out the small banks and have them bought out, is that fraud? It's sure not capitalism.
That's what's happening in the US right now. Regulation limits consumer's choices. Why not fix problems by educating consumer's to not fall victim to fraud rather than taking away their options and putting in rules lobbied for by rich to favor the big players?
Or you could just keep trolling

It's frustrating, isn't it? No one realizes that you can't just "have a little socialism" for the common good. There's a reason all the tech is developed in the USA. Medical break through? US. Yeah, we'll sell it to Canada way cheaper because the incremental costs work out. 
You can't just change 'little' things like UBI or whatever without expecting big shifts elsewhere. 
Good luck getting someone to reevaluate their world view. At least I'm not the only one who gets fired up about the idea that the US can be more socialistic without losing the benefits of capitalism.

But it's the government handling the 80%. So you might get 20% benefit. 
Why can't charities help? Crazy idea: 80% tax rate and charitable contributions are tax credits (not deductions.) You get to pick what your money goes to. The school charity, homeless shelter charity. You don't like the way the current school charity is run? Start your own or offer your donation to someone who will. The food bank charity only distributes 60% of what they receive? They will have competitors who can keep overhead lower.

I don't understand why the employees didn't leave and start a competing business if there was that much money left on the table for them. 
I get what you are saying. The owner was probably silly for not paying better, but I don't think it'll be fixed by workers sitting tight and not exercising their options.
Be the change you want to see. Good for you for moving on

Dude handed 500btc to a private entity. They are refusing to give it back. How is that capitalism? It's fraud.
Capitalism is the part where others are free to not make the same mistake.
Before you say regulation prevents fraud, just think about if that's really true.

It's almost as if being able to have a vision, pulling people and resources together, and executing that vision is exceptionally rare and should be rewarded highly. Like, if you own and run a successful business, you deserve to make exceptionally more than what your employees make.

If everyone was underpaid, why didn't they leave?
Surely you aren't suggesting that the owner is responsible for the employee's death. The employee was negligent at taking care of his own problem. He could have changed jobs and gotten better healthcare. He ended up paying more and having a terrible outcome too.
If you own a company, you aren't suddenly responsible for all your employees lives outside of work. They aren't going to come in and work for free if a cheaper competitor opened up next door.

Let me rephrase what you just said. 
The goal of a startup is to get bought by a large company who can more effectively market what you made (see below.) The rediculious selling prices indicate that the companies cannot innovate like the small startups. Each have their place. 
Added point of clarification. 
Large companies don't and can't control the market. Consumers do. Period. Facebook nor Google control anything. They can not compel anyone to use their products. People freely choose to use their products because the products are superior. No one really cares about the negatives and they show it by continuing to use their products. 
I totally agree that this isn't really a free market because the only entity with true power of compulsion is the government. Every regulatory requirement they add is a fixed cost or semi variable cost which disproportionally hurts smaller competitors. Furthermore, the force of the government can be leveraged through IP laws by lawyers in ways that also don't scale well for small competitors.

You could always manipulate the price down by posting fake articles or finding a bug or lots of other ways that don't involve buying "from the community." But there was no way to really profit from this activities. Now there is

Buying futures isn't necessarily buying the commodity. I don't believe it's an inflation problem.
It's an incentive problem. The original white paper explains that any bad-actor has no incentive to disrupt the rules. If you own enough mining capacity to be able to inject fraudulent transaction, you would devalue the currency you just got fraudulently. You'd be better off just reaping the rewards of mining. That's one example. 
Futures changes the incentives. Now someone can be benefit from a drop in price. Before, everyone with stake in Bitcoin wanted the price to go up. Now it's mixed. 
Bitcoin's greatest achievement wasn't the blockchain. It was creating an organic system where everyone's interest were aligned. That's now in jeopardy.

100% chance of getting a $1 chocolate bar = $1
1% chance of getting a $150 silver bar = $1.50
Should have included a $1 lottery ticket as well. People like taking chances, just not when there may be ambiguous work involved.
