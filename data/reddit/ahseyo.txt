you've been a redditor for 24 hrs.
I already know who's being trollish or not.
gtfo and stop being a dick.

a lot of sites don't allow you to pay with bitcoin directly. more than those who allow you to directly pay with bitcoin.
and I would rather not go through waiting for checks or knowing if I paid enough for small transactions.
for big transactions I'll use bitcoin directly

Fuck centralization.
Govts and exchanges hold each other hand in hand.
Thank God I know decentralized exchanges are a thing.

Didn't buy because I don't read magazines a whole lot.
However, most of our scientific news magazines are quite good and non objective when it comes to reporting on content. I'm assuming that is the case here too, typical neutral and decent journalism.
Our scientific newspapers are a whole lot different and often much better.

I'll be looking in to as many of these as I can :) thanks beforehand if the input. I'll probably stick with the one that has the best interface + good mobile app.
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:18:58
Did you do it through the website?
The app verification is really shitty.
I don't have access to my ID at all times and having to wait to go through verification sucks I'd rather just upload a clear picture of it.
I also have my proof of residency digital.
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:24:24
Does Xapo allow PDF upload of proof of residency? I noticed they force you to take an actual picture of your ID which is dumb. I always have a picture ready just for cases like these. They overcomplicate the process
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:28:16
I don't understand why so many people keep using these.
The whole point of crypto was to let control of centralized exchange points not exist or at least, have options.
The only reason they want your ID on the exchange is so they can hand over your information to whatever legal institution when they knock on their doorstep or farm for more user data. 
Technology and progress being slowed down.
I really don't get this at all, or why I'm getting down voted instead of people discussing why I'm wrong.

SOMEONE UNDERSTOOD MY REFERENCE
God bless you
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:46:34
If they didn't control the exchange fees then what's the point of not letting the user set it? Why separate technologies that help Bitcoin grow at a steady pace with scaling in mind? Again your opinions make zero sense and contradict themselves.
@_date: 2018-03-05 09:55:35
Do these offer virtual cards too?

I've used bitcoin to pay for stuff, haven't held much..been with bitcoin since it was 500$, haven't really regretted much.
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:48:42
I won't ever use them again . Had money stuck in ages and CS was shit to contact and took ages to reply, almost like they wanted my money held.
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:44:47
You can buy Bitcoins but you're often set with a low limit and withdrawing you have to either verify one way or another depending on where you buy.
So this is bs.
I've tried using many exchanges that takes weeks for verification processes to go through, and unless you want to buy Bitcoin with high lending fees, you're stuck with brokers as your only option unless your plan is to only invest small shit amounts on a daily basis.
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:45:26
Kraken enforcing ID verification and high fees even though Mem pool is empty, not all exchanges supporting segwit or LN so you often have to check and ask if they do before you even put any money in to them.

HODLIN HODLIN HODLIN HODLIN HODLIN YEAH
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:23:25
Kraken almost never works anyways so what's the point.
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:47:38
Almost every single successful website or business has at some point had affiliated marketing involved.
Are you dumb or just @_date: 2018-04-29 14:37:22
Wirex mostly ( one of the first companies after the whole debacle where they removed it ).
I use it on a daily basis to buy stuff in grocery stores and it actually works.
I just top it up online. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 14:31:52
Quite often
Now that bitcoin debit cards are becoming available again I just switch to FIAT super fast and can buy things online with it.
@_date: 2018-04-29 14:37:59
I live in Sweden :) not the most crypto friendly country AT ALL and media stance on crypto is very toxic.
