Notice how she says blockchain 2-3x more than bitcoin and only bitcoin when referencing the current state of blockchain? If the financial captains of industry were dedicated to bitcoin they'd be using blockchain a lot less and bitcoin a lot more. 
They can't trademark or skim profit from transactions from bitcoin. What makes you think their goal in mind is the global adoption of a system that allows for free transactions, unable to be manipulated and rigged? That's been their business model for the last few centuries and it's a concept worth trillions per year. 
Unless they can maintain billions in profits off those trillions in transactions it threatens their own value and hence their entire business model. 
They might come to find that blockchain is inseparable from bitcoin, but you can be damned sure they'll spend lots of resources trying to find out and probably building their own even if it fails.

That's the status quo belief. But so was a flat earth and a geocentric solar system- until it wasn't. 
Maybe it won't work. But this belief is worth trillions, so don't be surprised if they spend billions or hundreds of millions trying to find out. 


Like you said. Trillions. I think it's ultra naive to think the smartest people in the smartest sector won't be able to come up with an incentive or way to handle backend blockchain mining and hashing mechanics. 
Bitcoin is cool because it was the first really successful cryptocurrency, but it's not perfect. I realize a lot of people here have a vested interest in BITCOIN going to the moon. But those interests aren't the same as the people who measure their annual income in billions. I think people should stop kidding themselves and hiding behind mining and incentives as an impenetrable barrier against an alternative. 
Altcoin and doge didn't have the wealthiest sector of the economy backing it with nearly unlimited resources. 


Why do people act like an industry worth trillions couldn't possibly come up with an incentive to compete?

You guys are kidding yourself if you think they don't see it. Right now the only significant blockchain in the world is bitcoin. But they can't control that. Why would they buy in at market prices just to hype it up when they would prefer to make their own, control it, and hype it up? -- like an IPO. They want commissions and fees. Not free transactions. 
Now, it may be the case that they can't replicate the network in the same way bitcoin does and rather than fight it, they join it. But for now, without control and without manipulation being built in, they won't favor the word bitcoin over blockchain. 
Tech and finance guys are the captains of industry of this age. A good number know the score and potential. But they also know the potential of having influence in a system that has global monopoly. If they can't have a preferred set of rules and primary voting rights, the big boys aren't sure they want to play. It would cost them billions in fees. It would get harder and harder to skim as they currently do. 
So maybe in the end it's useless and they won't be able have blockchain without bitcoin. But that bet is worth trillions per year and is the stuff that keep billionaires up at night. Don't be naive and think it will be without a fight. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 00:11:20
That's a bet worth trillions per year.
Why is so convinced that can't happen? This is literally the soul of the global financial industry. Why would they buy into the existing system and hype it up without control when they could potentially create their own, hype it up, and most importantly, control it?

Maybe it won't be possible, but that's what they want. 
Why is it so hard to believe that when elites in the banking and finance industry say "blockchain" or "cryptocurrency" instead of "bitcoin" they're talking about their own, controllable, manipulatable alternatives. 
It's a bet worth trillions. Free for end users is not something they want. They want to skim percentages and gamble on outcomes while manipulating the backend mechanics. Why do people continue to insist disrupting global currency can only end with bitcoin dominating and nothing else? Altcoins, doge, lite coins, none of them originated from the billionaire class money changers so those comparisons are irrelevant.

They are also known for designing their own system or software to compete with the market. 
Music/video, mobile OS, etc. 
This is a yet another example of wanting to build a blockchain based service and only using bitcoin if there is no other alternative. 
Look what they've done with Tizen. Android OS is selling like gangbusters. But nope, they want to push and sell their own OS-- which obviously yields more profit because of the most important aspect, control of the experience and backend.
@_date: 2015-06-20 00:59:08


But that also supposes that bitcoin will be underestimated for quite a while longer. Finance and tech industries are the best and brightest nowadays. These aren't government free riders. 
Say what you want about their character but they are the best in the world at extracting profit and commission from anything and everything. 
These insiders are already moonlighting into bitcoin figuring things out from the inside. In a world where HFT moves markets, bitcoin is too much of a risk to ignore. Look at all of the big names talking about blockchain technology. But also watch how they emphasis blockchain and try to demphasize bitcoin. If they can't develop a proprietary alternative, they'll brute force the incumbent system, bitcoin.

Keep in mind the threat would be to an industry that is literally tens of trillions per year. If an entity or entities were motivated to do so, the cost and infrastructure requirements wouldn't be as insurmountable as you think. 
Think about that. A system that transacts trillions and yields hundreds of billions in profit. The costs you mention are miniscule by comparison if a concerted effort was undertaken. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 00:45:52


The same validity and trust that allows for the current system for global financial transactions. You DO realize those are the people in the room she's talking to? Captains of financial industry. 
They want to profit from it, not sing kumbaya and talk about how awesome fee free transactions will be for the world's consumers. 


And it's worth trillions. How much do you think they'll spend to at least investigate that possibility, even if it doesn't work out? 


Idealism doesn't always change the world. Sometimes the financial wizards win. Lots of people are making lots of money on the current system. Why do people think those people won't fight like hell to maintain a monopoly on systematic transactions? 
On one side we've got people "believe in the youth of this world" and on the other we've got billionaires with a vested interest in accumulating more wealth. That business model doesn't include buying a million bitcoin's and wanting the value to go up so they're trillionaires. 
How often do the believers beat the 0.001%? Because the seriousness of the concept means the entire global financial system is up for grabs. 
So yeah. In a few decades, bitcoin might only be a footnote like darpanet is today, meanwhile, like the Internet as a concept, blockchain is what survives. 
I'm not sure why people downvote me for trying to display the other side of the perspective. Do you not care about what you're up against? Do you think good ideas always win? A lot of times it is fat cats destroying competition and regulating monopolies, so don't think that can't happen.

Counterparty liability is an important aspect of any asset. If you cannot withdraw or convert that asset into a more fungible item it detracts from its value.  
Hence why physical gold is superior to many types of assets despite its criticism.  
The stock market for example is all well and good until Scottrade or Etrade goes down indefinitely.  Same with Mt. Gox, when things are good, they're good, when they're not you're locked into a counterparty with intentions and underlying assets you can only speculate and hope about.

They've already funded 50-100 companies over the last two years and the most they can say is that 95% are still in business?!

You're exactly right.
I think about the number of bitcoins I'd need to buy in ~2011-2012 when Bitcoin was fractions of pennies on the dollar to never have to worry about money again. $5,000-$10,000 into bitcoin in 2011/2012 would be tens of millions of dollars at peak pricing and a little lower today. AWESOME, right?! 
Well not exactly, ignoring private transfers (maybe the Winklevi would buy them?!) how would you go about getting all or even most of your bitcoins out of bitcoins and into much more easily spendable  fiat? 
The fact is you couldn't, and still can't today. As said there simply isn't enough liquidity with ANY exchange and as you sold, such a large volume the remaining unit's values would drop.
Until a larger scale exchange or maybe an ETF comes out, I don't see how it's possibly to withdraw more than six figures and even then that seems like it's stretching it.

@_date: 2014-04-10 04:21:16


Except no exchange will let you do seven figure transfers into fiat... NONE.
The only way bitcoin transactions take 10 minutes is if its bitcoin to bitcoin, bitcoin to fiat is MUCH different, especially at higher amounts.


But the thing is it isn't.  I've seen 8 figure fiat wire transfers get received in a few hours.  No bitcoin based entity on the planet could do that whereas any number of a hundred banks could easily do it.


My example of 7 figures is extreme only to highlight the weakness for any kind of widespread transaction mechanism.  When in reality a couple of six figure transactions would bring most exchanges to their knees. Only the top few could handle low 7 figures. 


And if you did that with fiat, for tens of billions of dollars, nothing at all would happen.
That's the benefit of trillions of dollars of global liquidity.


But that's the thing, it can't benefit big money until there are features that big money can use.  Not being able to withdraw 6-7 figures consistently is a problem.  HOWEVER, the good thing is if there is ever a time where that is possible 1x BTC will be worth a LOT more than it is today and that's where the huge valuation projections come from. 


Demand is obvious, BUT how much is hype and how much of it is curiosity and how much of it is top 5% BTC holder marketing  (winklevi)


But they can't possibly make enough of a percentage to cover the huge principal transactions.

They threatened the silk road guy with decades in jail if he didn't give them his private keys. Some were surely multisig. The result was still the same. They compelled him and ultimately seized his cache. 
If you don't have leverage in those situations you can either give them what they want or face the consequences. How is that so hard for you to understand? 
They can compel you to give up your keys, multisig or not or deal with the fall out. If you don't have the entire part of the key they'll go after who does and or throw you in jail anyway.

I agree with you, but a good number of governments, the US included, and have a vested interest in keeping competing currencies suppressed.

How do you figure $200 into bitcoin could let someone retire in 20 years? Even the most optimistic estimates of $50,000/btc wouldn't come anywhere close. Not to mention that for bitcoin to become worth that much in 20 years would require every other economic system on the planet to collapse. 
Maybe 3-4 years ago when each bitcoin was $0.0001 each. 
What you are talking about is SPECULATION like any other. It has nothing to do with investment, it is gambling in the way you're describing it.

Weak hands has nothing to do with intelligence. You could be very smart and need to allocate your resources elsewhere. 
Strong versus weak hands only means that someone has a higher or lower tolerance for volatility. Strong hands traditionally means an individual or entity who can weather any storm short term. Weak hands are those who bought bitcoin to get rich, currently watching it go down, getting a sinking feeling in their gut and liquidating. 
A strong hand believes in whatever vehicle we are talking about and can absorb and ignore most short term shocks as long as they believe in the overall market.

That's a great sell side analysis. 
Tons of people here preach merchant uptake as the most necessary component and it might be, but the vast majority almost immediately convert to fiat so it actually accelerates macro sell velocity, thus creating a downward pressure on price. 
As merchant bitcoin uptake increases, downward pressure on price will also increase unless more of these entities hold onto bitcoins for a longer period of time yet in a deflationary envionment there is significant downside risk to holding coins for very long.

I assume from your snark you don't think it's possible. The reason you think that is because you haven't seen it publicized. The reason it hasn't been publicized is because they banned Peter Todd and deleted his posts.

Yep. Even the big boys need a golden goose of some sort, even the efficient online behemoth Amazon has uber profitable divisions like AWS that allows them to do creative things. 
Apmex.com for example, the largest online precious metals seller charges between 29.99 and 49.99 per Oz over spot most days on various gold items. 
Less than an Oz, generic, non assay would be less, but those are like ads for $0.99 for a dozen eggs nowadays- loss leaders, limited time and quantities.

It's always hilarious to hear that bitcoin is perfect because it prevents things like double spend and centralized nodes, but in reality we are starting to see flaws crop up.

His dad being a successful VC helped. Now he's the father of a third generation VC, Adam Draper @ BoostVC. 
I'd invite you to research some of the stuff the guy says about entrepreneurship. While he obviously had a privileged mentorship under dad and granddad, his comments seem really disconnected from reality. (like him saying Entrepreneurship is like hanging your head against a wall for 10 years only to realize there's a door while he hasn't even been out of college for 10 years). 
His personal blogs also talk about wanting to make a real iron man suit.

I need exact figures here on my hypothetical.
Much easier to double spend, brute force and much longer transaction confirmation time. 


You're still forgetting double spend, brute force 51%, core revisions from anyone who gained control of the blockchain, transaction time. 


I'd argue it would catastrophically collapse. Trust would be gone in the current envionment if those things happened. 
You'd have tons of people trying to trick double spends. You'd have enterprising individuals brute forcing the network to control consensus, you'd have self serving revisions to the blockchain core... None of those things are recoverable without a large decentralized network (which makes mesh ad-hoc much more difficult) and accessories to connectivity and electricity to run it all.

Gold: "as long as"


Bitcoin and gold both saccomb to if, but there are many conditions where gold survives and bitcoin doesn't. My point is that in every one of those scenarios bitcoin require Internet and electricity whereas gold does not. Nor are there any scenarios besides extreme dilution from huge increases of supply (like a mountain sized gold cache or efficient asteroid mining) that could completely collapse gold's current value. 
Yes apocalypse is a far fetched scenario, but so are speculating on bitcoins hoping to make you a billionaire. Even the Drapers are down 50%.
I subscribe to and the more mainstream subs of and to a lesser extent is like but an order of magnitude more zealous and dogmatic. 
Dissenting opinion and critical analysis are not welcome unless they agree with the hive mind and that's kind of sad. Because as I've said before, if an example is so valid, you shouldn't need to brute force downvotes to prove your point. 
People downvote because they disagree, not because it adds or detracts from the conversation. 
My feeling is that there are too many "to the moon" speculators, most of which are well above today's price, all NEEDING the price to go up just to break even. That pushes strong hands to the periphery and weak hands take over the mainstream. 
Yes there's potential to goto 50k/btc but there is also risk most people don't want to appreciate or acknowledge. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 00:25:35




People couldn't. A concerted enterprise level effort or zombie net absolutely could. The advantages of decentralization diminish if you have individual nodes being replaced by centrally controlled nodes. 


Double spending requires ownership of btc and enough lag time to where the error can't be caught quickly. 
You'd have no way of confirming in that scenario because the network size would be much smaller, so transaction confirmation take much longer. 
You'd have to trust a person because block completion confirmation would take much longer. You can't wait hours or days to make a transaction even if you could find a vendor or merchant who wanted that asset. 
 &gt;And when I say the community would put the pieces back together, the last version of bitcoin core would regain consensus- If goldman sachs tried to fork bitcoin, you should avoid trying to download bitcoin core from goldmansachs.com.
Meanwhile btc value collapses, exchanges are insolvent and the market cap and blockchain network don't look so unique. 
Furthermore you'd have no way of knowing if it was Goldman Sachs or anyone else. They definitely wouldn't advertise it. There could be any number of Trojan horse type code revisions that aren't obvious. 
There are numerous ways to spoof and cheat the system of trust and blockchain network were down for any significant period of time, say... A week?

@_date: 2015-07-06 00:11:43


You'd be cutout completely if someone with the ability to control 51% of the network changed the core rules. That alone would be fatal. 


Don't you think the trust and therefore the value would plummet to zero in addition to exchanges and processors going insolvent and bankrupt? After which time, it would probably be a single entity vying for control of a new blockchain (probably Goldman Sachs, BofA or the federal reserve). 


You've still got double spend, brute force, core revision issues. 
The network would turn into a tiny sandbox and anyone who could control it would basically own it. When you were finally able to connect, you'd find the core rules have changed significantly. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 00:19:39


Temporary is important for things like brute force 51%, double spend and core revisions. Permanent would be fatal for bitcoin so for this thought experiment I don't even consider that because gold would be clearly superior as it has thousands of years of precedence. 


If the people can afford to pay for Internet and electricity. That's not even a failure of the grid and it's unreliable. Unless your ISP and electricity provider accepted bitcoin, even owning bitcoin ahead of time would be challenging, let alone miners and nodes operators.

Just like every time there was a loss of electricity and Internet in the last few thousand years gold has been in use..... Oh wait. 


You DO realize only speculators trade gold online, right? Ownership of gold is based on physical possession. If you don't hold it. You down own it. 


Just like for the previous thousands of years.... Oh wait. 
You act like bitcoin's mere existence makes gold obsolete but there are many advantages, most of which I've listed above. 
You also seem to think gold is mostly traded online. That's probably why Germany, France, Venezuela, etc. is repatriating their gold digitally instead of physically...oh wait. (they demanded physical delivery, if you weren't aware). 
That's probably also why during the current situation in Ukraine, the first thing the US military did was move their gold outside of the country.

When the dust settles gold has thousands of years of precedence through collapse, invasion, war and famine. Neither do you need electricity, computers or networked Internet to transact.

@_date: 2015-07-25 00:48:05




But how are you so sure Bitcoin is AWS in your example? 
Also, how do you know some Chinese company offering scaleable, non proprietary, cheap infrastructure hosting doesn't eventually kick AWS's ass in the future? 










They already have those things, how is bitcoin superior? Why would you want one way tranactions when some of those settlements are for billions? 
Drudgereport? An early lead on what? 1990s style html? 
Major bitcoin merchants have seen revenue from bitcoin payments decease 30% due to evangelists being the majority of that business. 
Growth is supposed to growth, not decline. That's not exactly indicative of a ubiquitous global phenomenon spreading like wild fire. 
As it stands, uptake has little incentive for most people. 










Might makes right. The only reason Hitler didn't beat the allies is because of overwhelming violent authority. 
Ideology and idealism matters a lot less than the actual ability to project your power. 
You can see why I think it could be considered naive when people think it's impossible for an industry worth tens of trillions to muscle out or create a competitor that is multiple orders of magnitude smaller by comparison. 
Even a tiny fraction of their resources going towards control or collapse would be cheap. Look what happened with tx stuffing a few weeks ago. And that was cheap to execute. 










Whoever owns the hubs, nodes and routing owns it. DNS, backbone, etc. Anyone large enough with enough resources can coop the standard. Tcp-ip required government and academic backing to become the standard. Popular consensus requires resources to buy in for a vote. Guess who has the most resources currently? Money or resources are free speech on the blockchain. 
Right now consensus is in the hands of the enthusiast community. What happens when the profiteers and rain makers get involved? Few people know who invented the transitor but it's Apple and their search for revenue and profit that currently owns that channel and guess what their goal isn't? Non proprietary standards, infact they're invested in the opposite. 
What good are protocols if your competitors own the pipe? 
You keep asserting bitcoin to be standard in each situation above, but the opposite is true. Bitcoin isn't AWS, they're rackspace. Bitcoin isn't iOS or Android it's windows mobile. 










Remind me how much it cost to tx spam the network a few weeks ago? And that's cheap. Imagine if they spent millions or even billions. If you're disrupting trillions its naive to think those invested would commit serious resources. 










It doesn't matter who invented it, it's who can execute and manipulate it best. 
Bill Gates stood on the back of Titans. He didn't need to be the 
Steve Jobs got the glory, wealth and legacy, not Woz. 


Yeah, money is a terrible incentive. No one cares about money. Remind me who has more? Bitcoin start ups or Titans of finance with streets named after them.
Dont mistake disruption for victory. 










Pie in the sky idealistic circlejerking is getting old on It's becoming impossible to discuss the potential risks and threats. 
If what everyone is talking about is true, it will disrupt the flow of trillions in tranactions? That's a liability for the wealthiest entities on the planet. 
But what's position? No, it's impossible, could never happen. 
Yeah, what would have happened with just a bit more in tx spamming and how cheap would it be? The cost isn't even a fraction of a fraction of their daily operating budget. 
Bitcoin will either be worth a lot, or nothing. You need to acknowledge the latter as often as the former.

Absolutely. But when the dust settled which would be more useful. And after civilization began to reestablish itself... Which would be superior if the other didn't collapse completely?

@_date: 2015-07-05 22:06:47


What percentage of the bitcoin blockchain (miners and nodes) currently uses those methods and was percentage of bitcoin users, merchants and payment processors could transact with them? 
We are not talking about an ideal world in the future. We are talking about today. What would happen if a significant number of miner or nodes couldn't connect? What would happen to bitcoin if that happened and they couldn't?

You seem to be ignoring the fact that vaults like that have fail safe and redundant electrical systems for just such situations. 
How is transportation an issue? Again, it's been transported all over the world, for thousands of years without electricity and Internet. 
We've never seen what will happen if there were significant failures of either electricity or internet to bitcoin. It's untested in those situations. 
Untested. You don't assert technologies are sufficient to replace vehicles with thousands of years of precedence without significant and rigorous testing and contingency plans. Bitcoin today cannot even agree on a blockchain size and fork logic.

I disagree. 
Gold @ $10k/Oz and or bitcoin @ $26k/btc would signal GLOBAL economic issues at this point. 
15% off coffee and buy.com hasnt caused a tidal wave of new users. The only thing that could push it that high in the near term is manipulation or fear. 


You're seriously underestimating what would happen on the other side once this thing gets going. Gold supply is finite. Inability to deliver is literally default. You can only hide that for so long. A similar thing would happen with bitcoins as a 10k gold/26k btc scenario means it would be incredibly difficult to find sellers. 
In both situations it would require huge inflows. Going up 100x would mean there would be ~$350 billion in btc market cap. That would be an epic amount of assets being sold to buy btc. 


I like how you matter of factly reduce the biggest engine of the global economy with questionable back of the napkin math. 


Righhhhttt... Nobody would notice. You can debate whether btc could or should go up, but it's pretty hard to believe no one would notice. For the reasons I mention above, for gold or btc to get to that point significant assets would be converted to btc, of all types. That requires a willful desire and demand to do so. Sort of like selling all of your belongings and moving to another country. On an individual basis it's not that strange but to suggest that society could do that wholesale without significant friction even if everything went well, defies logic. 
Change. Even for the better, is incredibly difficult. Considering the underlying economic realities that would motivate such a huge shift, it's chaos that is much more likely than uptopia that would necessitate such a paradigm shift in today's world.

As someone who was trying to get 30-40 BTC out into fiat cash during the $1200 run up..... It wasn't. 
No one could process an order worth more than a few thousand dollars. They had no liquidity to do so.

@_date: 2015-07-24 23:19:08
Unless the entities that currently do business in the financial industry (that is worth trillions) can make a profit, why would they participate? 
They're not looking for free, unconditional, nonreversible transactions. They're looking for float, churn and fees. 
If bitcoin every got big enough to threaten the financial industry, they'd spend billions to kill it, or take over consensus and Institute fees. 
THATS why they want a blockchain instead of bitcoin. If you can't control it, you don't own it, and they want to own it. (and most likely have channels to manipulate it). 
There are so many unique variables to bitcoin, blockchains and cryptocurrencies it's entirely possible for them to find flaws and anomalies to exploit. Suggesting otherwise is naive. 
It's also naive to suggest the best in the world are already working on bitcoin. No, the best in the world are in finance, tech and bio, the average salary is a quarter of a million dollars because they're generally the smartest people in the room. 
So the question becomes, who are you to make such an assertion? You've got biased assumptions based on idealism that has nothing to do with corporate motives.

But they're not getting paid a premium to do so. It's like any other start up type job. 
The big names involved have done so because they've been recruited by people who want big names from finance for connections, regulation and lobbying but that's more like celebrity endorsement than boots on the ground best in class development. 
What happened when Apple wanted to get into electric cars? They started offering 400-500k salaries for battery engineers. 
Gokdman Sachs paying a mid to senior level dev 500k wouldn't even be out of the ordinary. That's what bitcoin is up against.

Exactly. Counter party liability still exists even though it takes another form. If you require someone else to do something in order for your asset to be worth something it can be said to have counter party liability. The reason physical gold has been so significant for so long is that in addition to the qualities of money (fungibility, division, rarity, etc.) physical gold has the least amount of counter party liability out of most asset classes. 


It'll come down to merchant trust and the average person's faith in a specific asset class. Old people, the ones with all of the net worth and liquid assets? They know of gold a heck of a lot more than bitcoin.

That all depends on how much of a threat they saw it as. Keep in mind finance guys are generally the smartest in the room. The industry itself is worth trillions. They consistently collude with other conglomerates. 
That's why I think today they could crush bitcoin if they wanted to. Maybe that won't be true in the future, but it is today. That's also why I don't think it's a bank but more likely someone with a vested interest in the blocksize debate. It's a little too much of a coincidence that this torrent of transactions happens so soon after all of the talk and arguments over blocksize.

I wish we could discuss it more pragmatically in the entire bitcoin sub instead of people feelings like their moon coins are being disparaged and immediately downvote everything that doesn't tow the company line. It's like those people take it as a personal attack on their lifestyle. 
There are some very real issues, like the guy trying to create bitcoin payments for garage parking fees, but unreliable Internet access forced him to scrap the project. Vendor dereliction is a major problem if customers don't use their services, not to mention what happens if customers of those processor vendors don't see the value because no one comes in asking for it.

Snail mail would be superior IF you didn't have the elements required to send and receive an email: a send and receive computer, servers and network connectivity between the two, electricity for every connection between origin and destination, not to mention connectivity for anything inbetween.

Internet and electricity would take longer to get back online if rule of law abated for any amount of time. 
After the food and bullets were used, gold would rise fairly quickly. Just like the previous thousands of years when a society went through anarchy and Chaos. 
You'd have electricity and Internet, but not widespread enough to necessarily revive bitcoin, which by then, would have collapsed in price anyway. 
I was only speaking to temporary disruptions to electricity and Internet. Any kind of sustained loss would mean collapse for bitcoin. Probably unrecoverable. 


Just going off the last few thousand years of precedence. 
Do you think that after collapse, every miner, every node, every payment processor, exchange and merchant would suddenly go online again like a cable modem rerouting? 
The price would have plummeted like everything else and like a stock that goes to 0.... It probably wouldn't ever go back up. 
It's not selective. It's realistic. I own BOTH bitcoin and gold. But I also clearly see the advantages and disadvantages of each. For bitcoin to work, you need basic access to technology. People who run parking garages can't even reliably accept bitcoin since there is spotty Internet. Any kind of sustained outage would doom bitcoin.

What's going to happen if bitcoin or gold ever went way up in price? The majority of people would miss the boat, some wouldn't have the cash to be able to own a significant amount and by the time it'd obvious both could be $5,000-10,000/unit (1oz or 1btc for simplicity, both are divisible to smaller chunks) signalling a bubble in historic terms, appropriate and fairly priced only if the economy is in total and complete chaos on a fiat and therefore federal government basis. That would be worse than what we are seeing in Greece, by an order of magnitude at least. 
If it's appropriate that both assets are 5-10k/unit, the chaos in society overall would make guns, bullets, food and water significantly more expensive. By that point, I'm not sure any of this matters anymore. All you could do is hope to be lucky enough to survive.... In that scenario you'd have tens of millions of very desperate people in exodus looking for consumables. (supply chain disruption becomes dreadfully apparent in a couple of days and places like LA and NYC would be very... Uncomfortable.)

At the time there were no merchants accepting btc. The people buying cars or horses were jokes or one off larks. 


It simply wasn't easy or reliable.
But neither am I wrapped up as a speculator either. 
Believe it or not, the way I got the majority of my btc was when people gave then away on reddit years ago. At the time full btc were being given away like change tip bits are today. 
I was eventually able to get around $1500 into cash from 2-3 places. 
At this point, my input cost is zero and any significant move would make me rich, but I also have a unique perspective. I am not a zealot like most people around here who want and need bitcoin to appreciate to the moon so they can become rich. It's fun and interesting either way to me.

This whole premise only works while the majority of currencies you can buy and sell bitcoin in aren't undergoing massive local currency inflation. If a similar situation was happening in the US for example you'd have the same exact issues, haircuts every week.

Bitcoins being lost is irrelevant if you don't have access or can't transact. Electricity and Internet issues could be days, weeks, or months depending on the location and size of the crisis. If a large portion of economic activity ever shifted to bitcoin that would be a huge risk. 
Counterparty liability means relying on an external party/entity/service to do what you need and want to do. This is a great example. 
If Nepal had a high number of people or % of business that transacted in bitcoins previously, what would they do in the meantime while infrastructure reboots? 
The point is that without electricity and Internet you can't use bitcoin at all. The btc being there after the fact is not the issue. Being dead in the water because it's a digital currency and you have no access or way to transact is the problem. What if you relied on bitcoin day to day to buy food, water, and other staples?

And you're missing the point of what IBM is trying to accomplish. Bitcoin cares about decentralized trust. What makes you think IBM does? They're a global behemoth. Their goal isn't to make individual consumers feel secure. Their goal is to make a competing network, most likely enterprise or commercial which could leverage their unique advantages (of which there are many) and also recruit other huge global behemoths. 
If bitcoin represents a huge liability for the existing financial infrastructure, do you really expect the players in the existing status quo to take it sitting down? IBM and Oracle are in every bank and government on the planet... As I said... Don't underestimate them.
Elements like mining and decentralized trust are artificial constraints. All IBM or someone like them would need would be an alliance of huge companies.

I like the guy personally, he seems like a swell fellow. My issue is entirely professional. The introduction 30 seconds says it all. 
From his own mouth, "starting a company is like banging your head against the wall for 10 years only to realize there's a door". 
Except Adam didn't bang his head against the wall for 10 years. After a long summer post-college vacation reading comic books his dad and grandfather seeded Boost. They set him up in a huge building they probably own.  Filled with decor that would be at home at a corporate HQ worth billions. All while he's played VC CEO with their monopoly money. Boost must have been "successful" in their own right because it was dad and not Adam bidding on those silk road/US Marshall bitcoins to capitalize Boost companies with. Meanwhile he's asking for a percentage of a start up as an accelerator when he has never had to put in the hard work, fail, recover, fail again, only to have to completely reinvent the business model. 
It is also telling that it was his business partner and not him who first caught the $50k wire fraud. It makes sense that someone who never had to worry about earning any of his funds had no idea five figures were missing.
It might sound like jealousy but I truly would like to have seen what would have happened and what he might have created if Adam actually had to bang his head against a wall for 10 years to figure things out like the rest of us, but as it stands he hasn't even been out of college 10 years, let alone had to fight to grow and protect his business for a decade. Whatever happens he's always got daddy behind him to recapitalize his mistakes. It's dumb stupid silver spoon luck. Having observed the Drapers since Hotmail, six Californias, Draper University (where Adams even younger wife is a lecturer/professor????), Tesla, etc. I've watched as their eccentric style has left me even more bewildered than when I started. 
Admittedly, I've had some dumb luck myself, having observed bitcoin on reddit years ago when people were giving them away and buying a pizza with hundreds if not thousands of btc, I accumulated a few hundred btc not unlike changetips a few decimal places to the left.

People seem to think banks and others will be forced to use bitcoin, but the issue there is that it accomplishes less than half of what they want. And if they can't manipulate, control and extract fees, why would they want to use it? Usury and fees are their entire business model as well as backend mechanics manipulation when reality goes out of sync with projections. 
They want all of the benefits and none of the disadvantages (ie, unable to manipulate front or back, fees extraction, etc). That's why the biggest wealthiest industry in the world (which attracts the smartest people) is consciously avoiding bitcoin when they talk about "blockchain technology."
Hoping and wishing bitcoin will supercede "blockchain" could very well remain a fantasy when it comes to an industry and aggregate sectors that transact in the tens of trillions per year.

Not the current miners, because despite their throughput they are still largely small entities by global industry standards. Additionally, no single entity controls the majority- you're referencing what is actually a coalition alliance of miners. 
If bitcoin truly threatened the dollar as it would with a $500k valuation you don't think Apple, Amazon, Google, Goldman Sachs, Chase, etc. wouldn't suddenly get into the mining business?
Don't make the mistake of thinking "could not" or "will not"

Why is it worse? Banks aren't trying to accomplish what bitcoin does. They want to profit off fees and backend manipulation of mechanics if need be. Bitcoin accomplishes neither of those things.

And 50% can't seem to understand why it hasn't gone to the moon yet and made them a millionaire. 


If millions of people leave a tip? They'd be lucky just to get a single million to read the article. 


That depends. Merchantwise a lot of people can grown disillusioned with the "accept it and they will come" attitude of enthusiasts and zealots. The only people using bitcoin at a lot of these places are the same people who encouraged them to accept it in the first place. Net new business is flat or down. 
Not to mention we could see a crash in price as easily as an increase. Speculators and mtgox sent the price skyrocketing, not fundamentals. 
Any significant increase in price over the short term is due to fear not unwavering faith in bitcoin. 


It's not stupid to be excited. It's stupid to be blindly excited. doesn't give a shit about fundamentals or why merchants are having issues accepting bitcoin at brick and mortar locations or those kinds of challenges that'll actually see wider adoption once solved. They think everyone should use bitcoin so the value goes up and they get rich. They think Tim Draper should dump another $18m into a btc bid so the price stays afloat another 6 months. 
Oftentimes exemplifies zealots and wingnuts that make precious metals enthusiasts call them conspiracy theorists. While at the same time chasing away developers and people with boots on the ground and skin in the game. 
That's not the kind of excitement to be proud of, is it? To be so blindly rabid about wanting your speculation to appreciate that you silence, downvote, steamroll dissenting opinions. Not even dissenting opinions half the time, curious or valid criticism. 
When matures and discontinues the emporer has no clothes syndrome and we can have open and honest discussions where anyone who isn't a "too the moon" meme circlejerker can have their concerns and critiques addressed without downvotes into the basement. 
That is the day unbridled excitement will be welcomed. But until then I see a lot of the worst elements of speculation and gold rush greed. That is just as important as block size, side chain, blockchain, exchanges, etc.

The unfortunate irony is that there was very little inflation in certain stable economies based on gold. 
Salaries, rents, other assets prices never changed. 
Of course big players can manipulate the markers. Rothschild bested the government at their own war.
Countries ebb and flow but central banks still depend on and focus immediately on the gold. (Ukraine's gold was rushed away by the US very quickly after the civil war started, and Germany/Venezuela have requested repatriotation of their gold. Russia, China, Iran, Turkey, and others are huge net buyers of gold over the last decade. 
Until a huge supply gut of gold/silver saturates the market via a mined asteroid or something like that precious metals will have huge implications. Ben Bernanke goes on record disparaging gold yet the Fed has the largest official inventory of gold. It's all a joke. The world isn't flat anymore so there is a lot of other noise, but the powers that be know, gold hasn't lost its value, it just went out of style.

Gold and silver don't seem to mind. 
@_date: 2015-11-06 21:36:08


if true
Seems like a pretty big if
@_date: 2016-07-16 07:08:27


Psh, Internet or cellular connections are infinite and definitely don't need power! 
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:40:27
Bro. 
You need to learn what the gold and silver folks have known for a while. 
It's such a sad tragedy that your experiment sank in a boat accident in the middle of the ocean. 
What you're doing is sort of the opposite. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 19:25:03
If the electricity or the internet goes out...what happens to bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-07-18 08:06:47
EBay? They're like $6 on amazon 
@_date: 2018-12-24 05:57:54
Too bad gold and silver advocates aren't also firearms enthusiasts. Oh wait.

He was one of the last Elizabeth Holmes holdouts. He's either ignorant or doesn't care. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 22:44:58
You realize that if bitcoin ever truly threatened banking they'd spend a few billion taking the majority position from miners and brute forcing their way in, right? 
@_date: 2016-07-01 23:42:09
He's the Gavin Belson, Ehrlich Bachman or Richard Hendricks of the story? 
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:37:48
It's actually Adam Draper, Tim's ironman suit loving son who is to blame. 
Tim seems eccentric but I think the idea itself was Adam. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 00:26:36
That plus the original idea was Adam's I believe

Civilization can still barter with currency and other assets. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:57:09
Back in my day they gave away full btc like they give away bits today 
@_date: 2018-12-23 20:03:12


Done 
@_date: 2017-06-25 23:20:10
Yeah, the most hyper competitive industry that attracts the smartest people haven't thought of it....
That's really your position?

What is a 'Bubble'
A bubble is an economic cycle characterized by rapid escalation of asset prices followed by a contraction. It is created by a surge in asset prices unwarranted by the fundamentals of the asset and driven by exuberant market behavior. When no more investors are willing to buy at the elevated price, a massive selloff occurs, causing the bubble to deflate.
You could easily describe bitcoin in that way. I am an advocate as much as anybody but don't delude yourself into thinking there aren't significant bubbly red flags. Especially considering the very very rapid appreciation recently. That by itself is a red flag. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:53:12
How long can bitcoin survive without either? 
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:48:57
The children of the forest remember when idiots used to give away full btc. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 21:03:18
Your mesh network made up of you and who else? 
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:36:31
A bubble is something that is overbought and intensely believed. Does that describe bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-06-25 23:26:38
The drapers like the cockroach metaphor 
@_date: 2018-12-24 01:16:09
That's not the point. The point is that bitcoin depends on electricity and internet. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 23:53:49
Even so. Gold and silver would be more useful than internet money. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 16:07:50
Reminds me of the goose bumps book back in the day and probably from earlier fables. 
Guy wishes to be the best basketball player in the world or something and instead of a sudden Kobe Bryant tier talent everyone else in the world has been reduced below his skill.
Oops. Careful what you wish for. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 05:19:25
Until quantum computing becomes mainstream at least or we the internet/electricity keels working. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:25:25
How much is the premium over market price? $150-300?
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:44:58
Sucka some of us are still around from the 10,000 btc for one pizza days 
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:38:30
Gold and silver investors aren't happy though. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:18:49
That's not the definition. Value is subjective. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 21:11:14


Maybe when he drops the building an "iron man suit" tag from his signature I'll consider him an adult.... Much less an accredited investor and venture capitalist. 


My business? What business? I am criticizing a guy who constantly promotes himself but doesn't seem to be making smart decisions even with billionaire and other millionaire's backing. Even in this situation he sounds arrogant, trying to convince us he did everything he could (while being ignorant to how the system he uses works). 
The guy is a hack. 
They say another thing about multi generational businesses too. Grandfather builds it, dad maintains it, son destroys it. 
"Getting Adam first hand experience". - -  sure seems to be an expensive lesson so far. 


Even a broken clock is right twice a day. This guy seems to be right half as much with five figure holes in his pockets. 


It's much easier to not have to deal with reality when you're backed he billions. For some people's bootstrapping business this would be a very real issue with cash flow. For Adam? He'll just call daddy and ask for another suitcase of money and btc infusion. Probably after jeeves gets done washing the Bentley fleet of course.

How do you update the block chain? Carrier pigeons?

Is that better or worse? Due diligence is the VC bread and butter.
The technology was obviously bunk upon a closer look. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:45:37
That's where your logic falls apart. The "increasing price" element has in reality been "skyrocketing price" 
Very rapid appreciation is a primary signal for a potential bubble.
