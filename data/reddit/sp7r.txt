Sure. I think bitcoin is a pretty safe bet and if I had thousands to invest, I’d probably put it there because there’s a good chance my money could double within a year. But if I’m making small purchases of $100, I think my money is better spent on some alt coins. I may lose it all if they tank or whatever, but if they become big like bitcoin then I would make a lot of money. Small risk and a much higher reward vs minuscule risk and small reward in my opinion. Regardless I bought $100 of btc, $100 of ethereum, and $100 of litecoin the other day anyways

I bought $100 of bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum on Movember 4th using Coinbase on iOS, but I still haven’t received them even though the money has posted on my bank account... what’s up with that?

I value your opinion as you, and many others here, are way more informed about this, but am I that far off base in assuming that I won’t get a huge return on investment unless I have some serious capital up front? Meanwhile if I can buy several of the smaller altcoins for the same price and sit on them for a few years, then cash out when they’re worth what bitcoin is worth now, I’d make way more. Are people estimating that bitcoin will be worth a lot more?

Why should I buy bitcoin as opposed to a smaller altcoin. The potential for growth of the altcoins is much much higher than bitcoin. If I put $100 into bitcoin right now, even if it rises to $25k/btc I would have less than $400. Meanwhile if I invest $100 into litecoin, and it too rises to $25k, I’d have over $40k. Even if litecoin rises to just $250/ltc id have over $400. So am I wasting my time buying btc? I do not foresee btc ever being $1m/btc just because of the people that have hundreds or thousands of coins already would be billionaires and I don’t think it will happen.
