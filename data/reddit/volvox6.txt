Do you get paid to shit on other coins like that?
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:29:12
Gemini. Look it up.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:23:54
Me either, since 2012. Only way to keep ones sanity is to not check, not care and concentrate on other things while you wait. Wait until after the next halving is my suggestion. Then check the price.
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:31:37
No, the rest would have still held value as they are not shit coins as you call them. BCH however has no real utility and was artificially pumped by Ver and a bunch of Noobs with delusions of grandeur wanting to get rich quick.
BCH has no real utility and only servives because it has the name 'bitcoin' in it. If it was a solid coin, the noobs would have been okay with it's honest name- bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:56:07
I stand corrected on that one. I see it doesn't as of recently. 
BTC is having scaling issues, but at least the planned solution (Lightning network) makes sense as a viable solution that will scale, IMHO.  And its being actively worked on. Best come quick though!  :) 
If merchants are starting to drop bitpay or whatever because of the high on chain transactions that is a problem. Hopefully that will be replaced by this lighting transaction layer and converter merchants like Bitpay won't be needed.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:17:32
No, I'm not going to bother. Why do you think lightning is centralized? You can run a lightning node right now yourself. You sound like one of those people who say the government is full of lizard people. And I've learned to not waste my time trying to explain reality to people who have had 'that much coolade'. 
You believe what you want dude. I have no problem with lighting network. Like I said, go open up a node in your centralized system.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:56:23
??? dude, thats a lie. SegWit is just a way or organizing the data in the blocks better. Its nothing more than an optimization. You obviously have ulterior motives.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:08:25
Not a replacement at all. It will exist along side normal 'money' just like the internet exsist along side of cable TV. Anyone saying it will replace cash is like saying TV will replace FM radio.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:51:22
Dude you drank a LOT of coolade! LOL
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:54:10
Yes that implies that normal people will be able to use Bitcoin as easily as cash and it can scale to 7 billion people without grandma having to worry about fees or if her address is right. It means mass adaption and use.
You don't HAVE to use lighting. You can still access the blockchain directly. 
lightning is not just about Bitcoin, it will work on top of other coins as well and it's not locking down Bitcoin or anything.
What your saying is basically ' big banks, Walmart, scared, they are large'.
What I'm saying is I think you have been listening to Roger Ver and his cronies too much. Just watching the way all this fear is being spread and all the disinformation etc. This smells like the trump campaign and I want nothing to do with that kind of propaganda.
I've got no problem is a scaling solution like lightning or other layers. Seems like its a lot better plan then kicking the can down the road with no real solution other than keeping every 1 cent gambling bet on chain. That will never scale to 7 billion people. Besides the fact that it's obvious that Roger Ver and a few big wigs in China are behind this whole pump.
I look at both sides and it is NOT the Bitcoin/Lightning thing that seems shady to me dude. It's this Bcash stuff. Tech wise if everyone was behind Ethereum or Dash right now and pumping that- , I can see the argument: Better, faster tech. But BCash is just a retarded version of Bitcoin with a hack fix for the short term.. It's a scam coin plane and simple.
Granted, I own some and I'm selling when it's still high.

10 years.
@_date: 2018-06-07 01:32:33
Back when the btc network was being spammed? 
No, segwit was ready but many dragged their feet implementing. Especially Coinbase. Some say Coinbase was delaying implementing segwit on purpose, in order to give bch a leg up.
Others, like Ledger implemented segwit pretty quick. That's how a truly decentralized system works though, power to all parties to do what they want.
Batching has been around for a while also, not sure when that started but companies have really been making more use of it lately.
@_date: 2018-06-05 04:25:56

@_date: 2018-06-05 04:23:44
Segwit and batching I'm sure help. Segwit is a more optimized way of packing transaction in the block.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:54:13


Exactly this. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:20:20
Right? I agree. No more of this fork for alt coins BS. It has hurt Bitcoin overall.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:18:24
Sounds like pump and dump talk to me dude! Little salty eh?
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:25:46
Interesting that it started out as 'LOL' but then got kinda hijacked by trump'ism and associated with an egyptian god or some kinda weird shit. 
Anyway - that's how I first saw it used. So good to be aware that some might be reading more into a 'Kek' than the intended LOL !  :) 
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:41:15
why? Bitcoin has been in development for years. Changes are agreed upon and carefully decided via market consensus. 
THen some alt coin comes along and steals the name BTC just like that and its a totally different entity? That's not the BTC I brought. 
 It would be like Russia, hijacking over the american government or something. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:35:47
I don't know honestly. Used the seqwitt branch. Don't think it was very much. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:26:02
"The word “Kek”, originally a Korean onomatopoeia for a raspy laugh, had long been used on 4chan as a replacement for “lol” (laughing out loud). One day, a /pol/ contributor discovered that Kek is also the name of an ancient Egyptian frog god.
The similarities between Kek and Pepe were striking enough as it was, but Kek also has a female alter ego, or nemesis, that takes the form of a snake. This was quickly taken to symbolise Clinton, a universally reviled character within the /pol/ community. "
ok, I'm not that out of it. :)
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:43:27
One can feel the excitement after the b2x decision. Thats awsome for BCH (bitcoin cash) but it is not Bitcoin nor should holders be pushing for that obscurification at all. Lets not get all doge-coin-y in here.
Bitcoin is currently a good store of value that can be transferred relatively easily and is great for large values.
 
If Bitcoin cash wants to be the micro payment of bitcoin, it should aim for that.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:13:24
Took my BTC a whole half hour to clear last night when traffic was most congested. It's not that bad. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:25:18
BCH should be proud of it's own name: bitcoin-cash. 
It should not be trying to steal the name Bitcoin. It is confusing and seems shady. It hurts it's own reputation by doing so.
Why can't BCH be honest? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:45:29
But even reputation wise, making Bitcoin easy to understand is a goal. Confusing people with having bitcoin all over the names of different currencies is unsettling. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:56:11
BCH is Does NOT have tech advantages of BTC for goodness sake, it is the old branch, not the agreed upon BTC branch after the august fork.
 The only reason its faster now is that it doesn't have the traffic or price that BTC does. Its LESS technological and can't scale as well because it doesn't have the new SegWit1x transfer ability that BTC does. BTC has been around for ages and anyone who says otherwise stinks of people trying to steal the name 'BTC'. 
BCH is an ALT COIN, its not BTC.

@_date: 2018-04-28 05:17:46
sounds safe to have no confirmations on your spending then!
( But I'm just going to stay in my little buble and use Bitcoin where my transactions are actually confirmed. )
@_date: 2018-04-28 05:25:07
nah, he has flipped the loop and is trying to destroy BTC in the name of bcash from what I have seen.
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:56:05
Calling Bitcoin, 'bitcoin core' is a mis-information campaign. I'm not friendly with anyone who's down with that.
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:01:11
perhaps people are sick and fed up of the misinformation coming from bitcoin.com and bch in general and they are starting to make some noise about it. About time if you ask me.
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:01:43
Screw you asshole. It's called Bitcoin. Take your 'core' bullshit and shove that mis-information up you ass.
@_date: 2018-04-28 03:03:38
Cool. The whole 0 confirmations things sounds kinda unsafe IMHO. I mean, the whole reason for confirming transactions is to make it safe in the first place but whatever I guess.
Anyway- glad your happy with it.
@_date: 2018-04-07 02:25:26
First thing I'd do is clone that drive multiple times so you can keep trying and not worry about running out of space.
@_date: 2018-04-28 02:18:20
That's as neutral as my ass. 
The problem is, your a ver shill and you sound like one. Bitcoin is Bitcoin, consensus had it back last August. 
Just because you come up with 'bitcoin doug' or what ever doesn't mean you have the right to start slandering the real bitcoin with your 'core' propaganda bullshit. 
Again, consensus had it last August. Its bitcoin and honestly bcash. If you'r happy with bch that's cool, but stop slandering other coins. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:27:35
Its the same speed. Blocks are every 10 min. As long as neither chain is being spammed ( like currently ) they are both the same speed. 
How was your transaction 'way faster'? care to elaborate?

( I'm joking people! )
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:20:39
WTF is going on with all this bcash talk in bitcoin? Shouldn't these be kept to its own topic over in r/btc? 
Seems like there is a new campaign going on to spread fud around this forum.  I've never seen so many junk articles about bcash in this forum before. 
Again- this forum is for bitcoin, not litecoin, not nano and not bcash.
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:16:40
yea, but fact is, as a miner, mining BCH is a waste of time &amp; money when I could be mining BTC. (Which is what I do, because its more profitable. ) Even if you look at a profitability site like 'what to mine' for SHA-256; BCH is nowhere to be seen. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:22:05
Please don't be a idiot. Bitcoin core is a shill term Ver created and he is getting fools like you to repeat him like a parrot. 
Get some individuality and think for yourself and stop spreading that stupid term. Core refers to the program you install on your machine to run a bitcoin node. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:05:01
Yes. It hurts the reputation of bitcoin. The first thing many noObs hit is this BCH boolony. Its a scam and its off putting to the entire crypto ecosystem. Give crypto in general a bad reputation. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:32:47
Then why have I been following Bitcoin since 2012 and have only heard this term being used since last November?
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:15:51

Yes. Bitinstant- don't use it. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:44:16
good question:
"Is bitcoin as a system worth $10 billion dollars? (~$800USD/BTC)"
If compared to a company it would seem to me to be on the level of paypal or amazon? What is the total worth of Amazon?
Or - if bitcoin is looked at a different way, like gold- a limited currency that is held that will always deflate then it has a different value, that follows more of that model, and indeed its value is worth similar to gold as opposed to Amazon.
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:47:05
wait... it takes a 10 day 'review' to turn bitcoins into cash?
@_date: 2013-06-20 00:05:41
Yea, bitinstant is scamming people.
This is not growing pains or Anything like that. 
I used them 3-4 times until they did the same to me. $300 in limbo for over 3-4 days.
After investigating I found this is commen practice for them. Been going on a long time.
This is not a mistake, or growing pains, or idiots using a new system.
Bitinstant scams people and they have it down to a routine. You will get your money if you complain on the right bords but it will take 3-4 days.

@_date: 2013-05-22 17:31:00
Playing devils advocate:
How much would it cost to transfer 1 million from USD to BTC via dwolla and gox and withdraw that back into USD?
Because right now anyway, thats about what you would have to do to use it in the same way.
@_date: 2013-04-26 00:50:37
I'd ignore nello there....
Bitinstant usually takes up to 24 hours. about 4-5 hours was average from my experience.
But then again, there is this thread:
 and I don't recommend using them as it once took them 3 days to clear my money and I had to do it manually.
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:45:53
Well, a lot of us got ripped off. I'm out $300 on one transaction and $50 on another. 
If you look at this thread;
you can see that a LOT of people have been loosing money and Bitinstant is not resolving anything. They say- oh- we are opening a ticket for you, but you get no more info. No ticket number, nothing. Days pass and you ask again and get the same answer. Oh- I'll open a ticket for you. Then nothing.
Looking back a month or so, you can see this is regular practice.
BitInstant is a ripoff scam.
Wouldn't ever use them again.
@_date: 2013-04-13 06:34:32

@_date: 2013-04-12 16:30:57
They lost $50 bucks of mine in a transfer and never got it back to me.

@_date: 2013-06-24 23:25:12
Sorry, they take people's money. 
I used them a half dozen times before they scrrewed me. And no- it was not user error.
Nothing wrong with warning people of possible problems they will have as most bitinstant users have experienced.

Thanks for the insight guys.
Yea, just been using bitcoin and these are some of the more obvious issues I see with it.
Its really  right now that is stopping more people from getting on board, I think if / when that gets fixed, the coin explode in use or hording. We will see which one or combo of the both most likely.

they lost $300 of mine for about 4 days.
coinbase sounds good or wait until your verified at mtgox and you can go direct from dwolla to mtgox.

It's a scam. Do a search here for bitinstant and you will see whati mean.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:26:13
bitinstant is tricky at best. My best advice, don't use bitinstant. Get verified with MtGox which will mean waiting. But, doing transactions though bitinstant is a bit like russian-roulette.

what a bummer this keeps getting reported on by mainstream media.
 
1- If people keep talking about this its going to get shut down. Its only a matter of time. 
2- articles like this are recipes on how to do this. The asshole journalist, James Ball, who just published this article just turned on thousands of kids on how to get dangerous drugs and they'll all be logging in tonight to do it.
