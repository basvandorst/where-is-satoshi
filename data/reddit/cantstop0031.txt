so? still the same facts. no official source said ANYTHING. only cnbc fudding, like the always do vs BTC. 
if you read the headline "we know about this since 1month" you didnt need to post "this is from december 12"

Didnt answer my question tho.
I know you can BUT - it would make much more sense to let this drip down over time. Its not so easy to pressure it from 20k to 8k and would cost u significantly more. But much easier if there is a "narrative" behind it and you panic dump a bit every time so the retail investors do the rest

So why do you think we hit our LOW (9300) exactly 5min before CBOE settlement?

of course - but we know that this market is 99% driven by emotions... much more than any other market or stockmarket. because half of the traders here live in the basement of their mum.
