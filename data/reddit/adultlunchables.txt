You're getting downvoted but that's how I felt when he cut her off.
@_date: 2019-12-25 23:44:09
Give the guy a break, if we're all assholes when new people come into the community, we're going to be weaker than stronger. Yes, it's a silly question. But what's the harm?
@_date: 2019-12-24 04:02:27
You know, you really don't want to make a song about how the price of BTC has fallen. It doesn't really bolster the image of crypto, it just makes it look like this guy was wrong.
@_date: 2019-12-24 15:24:51
I understand that, but I'm not talking about me. I'm talking about an average person like my grandmother who can walk into a bank and get a free account with no fees and feel confident her money is safe. I fear that if crypto isn't as easy as doing exactly that, it will stave off mass adoption. I'm working on my solution, I might even do a hardware wallet. But the implication of that, to me at least, is a concern for the general public.

I don't disagree with you that people should do certain things like accept a slight learning curve with technology, but I'm telling you, I've tried many times to get grandma and other people (like my girlfriend's mom) to use e-mail and it just doesn't work. I also understand that free checking isn't really free, but the grandmas of the world don't understand that. Personally, I'm interested in crypto but I'm overall worried that I'm interested in it because I'm a technical/computer nerd type person and that Joe beer drinker will just never understand or care if there's even the slightest confusions or complications. You tell some average Joe even the word "monetary system" and they check out immediately. Not trying to sound mean, but really, the general public is very resistant to 2 things 1) learning and 2) changing.   
Overall, I'm glad to be here and I'm excited about this new hobby. Didn't want to be Negative Nancy I'm just like "Well, if I'm struggling with the security implications as a computer geek, what does that mean?"
@_date: 2019-12-25 23:08:04
So this guy running the channel also doesn't understand the purpose of Bitcoin? He's a professional that makes great content and his assessment is that he and other crypto channels can't survive off YouTube because the audience is nearly exclusively at YouTube. I think I'll take his opinion over yours, considering he's actually producing content and knows the subject matter first hand.
@_date: 2019-12-24 04:48:46
Even a $5 barrier to entry will stop crypto from mass adoption. This is very concerning. People are used to both free and secure services, and anything short of free and entirely safe is really a huge problem.
@_date: 2019-12-25 23:21:29
You're a peach. With people like you in the crytpo community I'm surprised we haven't reached mass adoption. You're so very welcoming and non-judgemental. Everyone will want to be a part of this community with folk like you around.
@_date: 2019-12-24 15:49:14
You're talking my language. Would you mind telling me why you're comfortable storing keys on a linux box with full node? I've got plenty of computer hardware to work with (my girlfriend bitches about it all the time lol).
@_date: 2019-12-24 02:13:08
I'm also aware that someone can post anything they want to GitHub but this particular generator has been on there for over 6 years and has a lot of recommendations in forums, on YouTube, etc. meaning it HAS had a lot of attention from a lot of people. To me, I'm not sure how something can fly under the radar that long and with so much of a spotlight on it. However, you did answer my question about backing up a hardware wallet so not I'm going to do some more thinking.
@_date: 2019-12-24 01:45:21
I was going to use this exact website by downloading it in full on GitHub then running it in an offline Linux distro via LiveCD. Does that sound okay? I'm also going to create another wallet for every day transactions, but wanted a paper wallet as a "savings account" basically. Anything I'm missing?
@_date: 2019-12-25 23:36:15
Nice gatekeeping. The correct answer is that we want every one in the world involved with Bitcoin, but nice try saying it's just for those who are tough enough. Anyway, I literally can't with you. You're toxic and full of anger. If you'd like more information I suggest copying our conversation and asking other people on Reddit which one of us is the asshole here. Later.
@_date: 2019-12-24 15:36:55
Now THIS is helpful. Thank you very much for this link. I have a little bit of coding experience, looks like I can code my own generator based on this and run it on an air-gapped computer.
@_date: 2019-12-24 14:09:30
So you'd like to change the entire fabric of society to make way for mass adoption? No, people don't teach their kids that but that's not the point. The point is these types of conversations make me wonder about the future. I'll probably end up getting a hardware wallet because I'm a computer nerd. It's the implications of that which are concerning. How's my grandmother supposed to get on board if these are the types of conversations we're having?
@_date: 2019-12-24 14:18:33
To me it seems like writing down the seed words on paper is the same security risk though, if the seed word is all it takes to open the account and access funds, what am I missing here?
@_date: 2019-12-24 17:55:21
Now I'm just harassing you for info... Does running a full node facilitate other people's transactions to where you're awarded with the small transactions fees or does that require mining software?
@_date: 2019-12-24 17:30:47
Sorry I should have been more specific, does running the full node make any difference at all or is that a separate thing entirely? Probably sounds like a silly question to you, but I was wondering since you mentioned the node if that has anything at all to do with security.
@_date: 2019-12-24 15:22:11
Good info but the context of this is that I want a cold storage paper wallet simply as a savings account that won't be spent from, if I spend from it I wouldn't use it again. Reading all of this though.
@_date: 2019-12-25 22:59:13
He said it himself in the video, he gets about 4k new subs per month. And he also specifically agreed with me in the video saying that the audience is at YouTube and if we want crypto to go mainstream, that's where you have to be. Not sure why I'm getting downvoted for just agreeing with the points he made in the video. And besides, your comments aren't true. I'm watching a new channel on YouTube where the guy made his first video ever 3 months ago and he's gone to nearly 300k subs in that short period of time. There are some elements of truth to what you're saying, but YouTube still rewards good content.
@_date: 2019-12-24 03:48:26
Yes I'm noticing that's a common opinion on this sub, however, I philosophically disagree that there should be a cost of entry (aka hardware wallet)  to cryptocurrency. Sort of flies in the face of one of the key promises of the technology. Further, it very much worries me because a barrier to entry cost will scare off new people to the scene. How will this technology grow mainstream if when getting into the hobby you're told to go buy a $100 tool?
@_date: 2019-12-24 01:52:49
This particular site is an open source project on GitHub, I was told to only use an open source generator on an offline computer. The operating system I'm going to generate the code from will 1) never be connected to the Internet and 2) will be destroyed once I generate the key.   
I'm 100% open to other methods, but to my understanding using an open source generator on an entirely offline computer is the only way to do this safely.   
If you were in my shoes (wanting an offline cold storage wallet)... how would you go about it?
@_date: 2019-12-24 03:15:28
No I appreciate it and I didn't want to sound a certain way I just didn't understand how something could be on GitHub for 6 years with a large user base and open source code and still have vital security flaws. As of this moment I'm still thinking and looking at different information online. From your info I've decided I need more information to make an informed choice.
@_date: 2019-12-25 22:23:38
I agree with you philosophically but you'd probably lose all your growth and a big chunk of your audience.
@_date: 2019-12-24 14:55:15
Yeah I read exactly that article last night while doing my research, it appears that the actual GitHub version is secure and only the web version was potentially insecure for a period of time but has since been fixed. However, it was enough for me to wait and do more reading. I'm hearing the bitaddress.org GitHub version is the standard for this and all other generators are based on it. So now I'm in the process of researching that generator.
@_date: 2019-12-24 15:25:43
But a passphrase can be added to a paper wallet as well? Not sure the practical difference at this point.
@_date: 2019-12-24 18:04:08
Yeah I've heard that. I was thinking if you had a free source of electricity it might be fun to do (not to get rich, but to just see some kind of return vs. losing money). I'm wondering if people who live by rivers or another power source could make it worthwhile. Drop a turbine into the river and connect it to your rig... Who knows? I haven't run the numbers.
@_date: 2019-12-24 02:06:06
I understand that could be the case but I'm not sure what a person could do short of being a programing expert. Having the project be open source on GitHub I was at least hoping that real coding experts would be able to inspect the code and alert people to any vulnerabilities. This particular GitHub project has a lot of users and has had a lot of people looking at the code, but that still doesn't mean I know for myself. In another comment I wrote about the pros and cons between a paper wallet and a hardware wallet if you care to check what I just wrote.
@_date: 2019-12-24 14:11:02
Hey can you expand on that for me? I would like to know what you mean about Trezor
@_date: 2019-12-24 02:04:06
Yeah I'm aware of the limitations as you describe, I understand what you're saying about it. However, I figured I would be in that boat no matter what. With the project being on GitHub and being open source, anyone in the world has the ability to check the code and report problems with it. I was considering hardware wallets, but I figure what if there's a hardware failure on the device? Say the manufacturer accidentally just created a single weak solder joint under a chip or something? It seems to me that with a hardware wallet, the device itself could fail and lock me out of the key. If you know more information about that point, please let me know. Trying to do this the right way, I just haven't found an option without its own pros and cons. With a paper wallet I can at least print 2 copies of it, with the hardware wallet I'm not sure if I can have redundant copies of the key in case of failure.
@_date: 2019-12-24 14:59:05
That was my concern about hardware wallets, hardware failure. I'm a vintage computer nerd and I've seen first hand how a hardware device can either last for many many years or simply fail at any point for a variety of reasons. Then I was told I can generate a seed to recover from a broken down hardware wallet but at that point of having a seed written down, I don't feel like that's any different from having a paper wallet sitting around? I like the idea of the steel stamp thing but I can produce something similar to that myself from a paper wallet, which I might do now that you've mentioned it, I love the idea.
