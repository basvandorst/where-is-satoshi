The # left to be mined would change every 10-ish minutes
To keep moving numbers, could add a timer since last block.
Personally I think it would be fitting for the number to only change occasionally when most people are looking away. Seems like every time I glanced back at Bitcoin things have changed.

Whether this is an issue depends on the composition of his retirement fund.
The portions held in USD savings, certificates of deposit, or bonds will have their spending power jeopardized as USD inflates relative to bitcoin.
*However, any stocks that he own should be fine as the bitcoin economy overturns the USD. If he owns 20 shares in a steel mining company, he "owns" some fraction of a collection of real estate, equipment, and ore. That has value regardless of the dominant currency.*
Ownership of companies will become denominated in crypto instead of u.s. dollar, and that's good progress. It's not going to wreck his retirement.
Mutual funds could be a mixed bag. If you're concerned about hyperinflation with fiat, pick funds that are composed of tangible assets and not bonds or some types of financial-sector securities.

I agree sooner &gt; later to quickly establish footing. However, even with that, I did a [rapid] DCA over the course of about a week and a half when I initially moved into the cryptosphere. Got the good prices, and got some better ones. ;- )
Personal choice, of course. But it felt like I was jumping in with just a smidge more control.

As someone who constantly hears "What can I even buy with bitcoin??" (edit: including two people that have recently asked me this, and who I know are partially self-sustaining urban farmers) I'm happy to see a post about this because it's a unique small business offering a new product for bitcoin (not the umpteenth electronics shop to take bitcoin)

I collect in BTC directly. So far, I've made about a third of it back, right on schedule. Should have said "pull out returns at the end of every week" I think. 
Why is my original response being downvoted? I know and acknowledged that "cloud mining schemes are scams" is the party line in this subreddit, and only shared my experience, along with the disclaimer that I have no proof it isn't a Ponzi scheme... I even avoided naming any service to encourage people to do responsible research (and avoid appearing to endorse one in particular)... QQ

Why do deflationary characteristics introduce instability in a currency's value? 
While some cryptocurrencies are often labeled "deflationary" (e.g. Bitcoin, with its 21 mil cap on the supply growth mechanism), you can also research coins that have inflationary mechanisms built in (e.g. Ethereum, Dash, etc).

I've had my Roth IRA at Fidelity for years. Contacted them a while ago with feedback about cryptocurrencies (e.g. that I would never let Fidelity or other institutions store my coins, but that it would be useful to watch wallets by public key, or be able to deposit into my IRA by sending xxx$ worth of Bitcoin to an address for that account, etc...)
They seem to be very forward-thinking about crypto. Here are excerpts from their reply:
"... We really appreciate you taking the time to provide some feedback on this. All of the changes we make are driven by client feedback, so it will certainly be put to good use. I have entered your message in a feedback tool specifically for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. ... it helps to hear from clients who plan to use these services when they are available. If you think of anything else, please feel free to send it our way. ..."
So if you're a Fidelity user, chime in with how you would use it! (Posting the above company response to both Fidelity-related threads on r/bitcoin at the moment)

Not mutually exclusive...! Most financially-responsible people both *save* and *spend* fiat currencies (e.g. a checking account and a savings account), why is this not also the default for bitcoin? I was able to set up a hot wallet for spending and cold storage for saving without my bitcoin imploding, lol. I think this false dichotomy causes a lot of people to think that cryptocurrencies are only an investment and not a currency...

I'll acknowledge that a lot of cloud mining sites are scams, and vice versa.
Because of that I was very careful when I picked one to try out. Did a lot of research and found one with a long &amp; solid record, and cautiously put my toes in the water with a small purchase (~3% of my crypto assets). 
Perhaps they're just running a very reliable Ponzi scheme. But as far as I can tell, it's legit. I pull my profits out at the end of every week, and have had no issues. Given the increase in BTC price, the 'lifetime' (=until terminated for no profitability) contract should ride out for quite a while yet.

If you want to approach from a relatively novel angle, I would suggest considering a graph theory formalism for the blockchain system, then showing the application of basic tools from there. I think you could assemble the chain into a sparse adjacency matrix pretty quickly, then it should be pretty easy to tackle with CS skills. There are a few sparse papers that touch on theory (so you have a shaky framework to start) but this is definitely understudied, imho. 
PM if you want to chat in more detail.

It might not be that the WSJ is ignorant, but rather informing their readership about how these markets differ from what they're used to. In most traditional markets, sectors tend to move together (e.g. if energy stock A is on a huge bull run, usually most of the other energy stocks will see a slight lift). So for people that don't know cryptocurrency dynamics, it's helpful for the WSJ to highlight the difference.

Mistakes were made, but I think you're doing the right thing to hang onto the coins for now. Everything feels FAST as a bullet train in the crypto world and the adrenaline rush is wicked, but take a deep breath and remember that it has only been two months. Investing in new endeavors, intending to realize your gains when they realize their potential involves sinking some value in, then keeping your hands off for months or years until they blossom. 
I don't know what the bitcoin-to-altcoin ratio will do in the short term or the long term (nobody does). Right now we have a rush of people hearing about bitcoin, and flying to the exchanges to buy bitcoin. In a month or two, they'll be eyeing the (cheap-looking at the moment) altcoin markets... We all expect institutional buyers to jack up bitcoin price, but I also wouldn't be surprised if half of the investment firms moving into bitcoin also decide to corner 5 or 10% of the market of each altcoin...

Coins sent to a private key are gone forever. Why? It has to do with the relationship between the address and the private key.
[address X] = [public key of X], can be unlocked by &lt;private key of X&gt;
The address that you send anything to is actually the public key itself. The private key to that public key can be used to unlock the funds.
The issue is that if you make a transaction that sends "to" a private key, there will be NO WAY for anybody to access them, because you would need the private key (OF that private key) to unlock it. 
There is no easy way to generate it, and I'm not even sure mathematically whether there would even exist an A-B-C situation where A/B are public/private pair and B/C are also public/private pair.

This is circumstantial, but I'm surprised that nobody has mentioned **Dennis Rodman** yet. He's a spokesperson for Potcoin, and has been buddy-buddy with Kim Jong-un for years. 
It's realistic that Rodman explained cryptocurrencies to KJ-u long before I'd ever seriously read up on them.

RE: "1) How does this work? If it's profitable, why doesn't everyone rent one?"
How it works: I think that there are a couple configurations. With the cloudmining service that I use, my fees go to cover equipment costs (electricity, cooling, experts to run, etc). Those machines are mining in a few big pools, and for the [X] amount of hashrate that I have purchased, I can select where my portion goes (I have my hashing power split between slush and BW.com). 
Why doesn't everyone?: I'm not sure how many people actually cloud mine, but you probably won't find many admitting it here. This sub is extremely anti-cloud mining. Because it's easy to hide a Ponzi scheme as a cloud mining service, there have been (and  still are) a lot of bad actors on the scene. So any time it comes up, people rage out of the woodworks - though I think it is probably a well-intentioned warning. Regardless, the perception around here seems to be that because 85% of them are scams, none of them could possibly be legit, which is a faulty generalization.
Separate from that - one valid assertion is that theoretically one can take home more of the profit self-mining rather than cloud mining. However this is often overused as a reason against EVER cloud mining, which overlooks the fact that there are other factors to consider besides raw BTC/hash (the start up costs, logistical issues, not being able to sleep because a bunch of GPUs are heating your room up to sauna levels, etc).

I would be very wary of ever using an address that somebody else generated.
An alternative way to obtain vanity addresses: you can find open-source vanity generating software to download for free, then vet the code yourself before compiling. That way you not have to trust any 3rd party with your key OR your email address. Always best to  maintain trustless practices.
I'd offer to compile the code and send it to you, but that'd be rather antithetical to my point. ;- )

If you held BTC on 1-Aug, then you automatically have the equivalent amount of BCH. The amount was fixed at the fork, so if you have sent or accrued more BTC since 1-Aug it doesn't impact your BCH holdings. You'll need to have a BCH-capable wallet to receive your coins.

They don't give you a bitcoin address that corresponds to a wallet containing your assets. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:29:55
Hmm, it kind of depends what you plan to store and/or how you plan to use it.
Trezor is handy if you want to pop open wallet.trezor.io anywhere and send some {BTC, BCH, ETC, ETH, LTC, DASH, ZEC}, and lets you flip between all of them easily from a dropdown menu.
Ledger goes nicely onto a keychain and supports many additional altcoins that Trezor does not, however I find it slightly less convenient to install apps to send coins, and although you can store 10 or 15 currencies simultaneously on one Nano, you can only have 4 actively accessible (by having the app installed).
Both have FIDO U2F authentication, which is nice. I can't wholesale recommend one hardware wallet over the other, as they have different features and strengths.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:45:58
Above logic is most likely correct.
However, if I were in the business of handing out trap keys, I'd wait for the SECOND transaction before clearing out the account, since people will often move a small "test" amount first. Just pointing out that this is a slim possibility.
So go ahead and relax a little bit, but avoid complacency (i.e. do generate new keys sooner rather than later, preferably in a hardware wallet)
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:05:10
Exactly! If the exchange rate goes down, then you still have $$ on hand to go discount coins. If the exchange rate goes up, then you locked in some coins at today's price.

@_date: 2017-10-26 17:16:02
Really excellent review of risk factors, OP!
It's a technicality inasmuch as there's a more correct way to calculate investment value. The change in BTC's value is not just it's exchange rate to a fiat pair (e.g. 6000 USD/BTC or 5100 EUR/BTC) but must also take into account the change in spending power of that currency during the same timeframe (for the reason that you highlighted :- ) ... following may not be precise, but it's something like this:
Investment value return = (USD/BTC[now] - USD/BTC[prior])*(change in spending power of USD from prior to now) 
This will be the same as (EUR/BTC[now] - EUR/BTC[prior])*(change in spending power of EUR from prior to now) 
So regardless of which fiat currency pair you use, you'd calculate the same (one true) valuation change for bitcoin.
This is on the assumption that arbitrage has caused exchange rates to converge so that pricing power parity in effect. I think this is a safe assumption for major pairings such as the BTC/USD/EUR discussed. In smaller markets or currencies (e.g. ethereum-denominated markets for altcoins) it's possible to still find cases where pricing power parity is off by 10% or 20%

Buy with crypto:
Step 1) buy with crypto
Buy with fiat:
1) sell crypto on exchange 
2) transfer from exchange EUR to bank account
3) wait for that transaction to clear 
4a) finally get that cash (hold my spot in line at the bookstore while I run to the bank)
 OR
4b) pay with card and give up all privacy, risk being tied to political activity, perhaps resulting in financial blacklisting, etc

Definitely a hardware wallet. Trezor and Ledger are great (I own both). It is absolutely worth budgeting 0.020 BTC out of 1.5 BTC to keep your coins safe. That's about one percent of your assets spent operational security, which is very reasonable.

I have some experience with US patent law. The text merely states that they will provide a way to correlate an address with a user. They do not state that it has to be single address-single user. "An address" that they are connecting to you could be something they traced 9 entries down the blockchain.

If one Bitcoin was transferred to an address in 2013, and then you use it to buy a car in 2017, then anybody looking at your transaction on the public transparent blockchain could infer that you had experienced some capital gains.
The issue is that the burden is on you (receipts) to show that you did not have capital gains. The IRS has the same price charts that we do, so they can simply look at your holding period to ascertain whether you should be reporting gains or losses.
