Holidays. We don't take cards and 90% of my customers now pay by bank transfer. I am UK based and this method is nearly free and nearly instant inside the UK.

Ah - okay I thought the main issue with expensive transfers was between the different countries not any difference in bank methods in the US - Thanks for explaining so thoroughly.

A bit more detail:
I have a small but growing number of customers from the US. At the moment they can pay by bitcoin, bank transfer or cheque. Bank transfers and cheques are very expensive for both parties and the costs of these seem to be increasing not decreasing. My product (holidays) are high value so the minimum transaction is approx $500 usually its thousands of dollars. I could easily stipulate that they could pay bank transfer (non reversable?) so is there a service that will take their dollars by bank transfer and pay me in Bitcoins? This would then mean low transaction costs for everyone.
When they say about the high cost of paying by cheque/bank transfer (to the UK) I suggest Bitcoin but then they say I don't know/trust bitcoin.

Its a tricky one. It would just be nice if they could pay their dollars and I get bitcoin without them even knowing about it.
@_date: 2014-07-10 21:26:23
Yes - this.
The public would be using bitcoin without even realising it. The merchant would get the bitcoins and the low transfer costs.
