People don't hate bitcoin so much as the libertarian culture glorifying it.

It's a common mistake among native speakers and it completely baffles me. Do people not read print nowadays? Literacy levels are terrible.

This is a disgrace. This man deserves the noose, not a government-paid retirement.

Fine, I'll bite.










See the contradiction here? If you truly had 'self-ownership' you would have the freedom to initiate force against anyone for any reason, not just self-defense.
The problem is you are conflating freedoms with rights. I think we would agree that the right to own property, the right to life, and the right not to be assaulted randomly are all very reasonable rights to have. But in order to enforce these rights we need to restrict certain freedoms of behaviour, such as the freedom to take someone else's property, the freedom to kill others, the freedom to assault others.
That is the entire concept of modern society - the balance between freedoms and rights is regulated through law.
