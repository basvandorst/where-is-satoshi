Lol you're the fool. I love your type. I get the want for less government but you make yourself sound dumb when your answer is do nothing to everything. 
What about global warming? "Do nothing! The free market will fix it!"
What about this insane healthcare situation in this country? "Do nothing! Less government involvement!"
I do think half of our institutions are useless and should be abolished but the government needs to handle some things that capitalism inherently will throw people under the bus for profit. And also the government is less scary if it's actually made up of "the people" instead of an oligarchic elite which gets rich just for being in office and doing what the capitalist machine wants. This again needs to be legislated against to stop or hinder buying off of politicians. 
Oh wait the free market will fix that won't it?

I'm voting Bernie if I can but Rand Paul is my 2nd favorite (he's better than Bernie is a few positions for me but not enough) though I have donated to both and dig him greatly.

Please read the comment erowid posted below. 25-I and 2C-I are quite different.

All 2c's are pretty different from their 25X-NBOME counterparts, at least in safety profiles, and somewhat different in effects.

Actually you're on to something. Take your method, and do the complete opposite, good luck mate!
