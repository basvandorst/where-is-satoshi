Bitcoin is backed by the POW Security Layer. The security layer is backed by the total hash of the network (total miners) and how decentralized they are. Bitcoin is the miners.

Here are some key points and take aways that are illustrated in the full in depth research report at the bottom of this comment: 
1. **United States is gaining Bitcoin Mining Market Share**: We are witnessing a large migration of miners to the United States from Asia &amp; Eastern Europe for political stability and secure/fixed utility rates, despite higher electricity costs in the US. This signals large miner’s conviction and commitment to long term mining operations with expectations of significant future Bitcoin price appreciation
2. **Capitalizing on the almost perfectly-positive correlation between Bitcoin price, mining hardware prices, and hosting/colocation prices:** Mining rig prices and hosting contracts are almost perfectly positively correlated with the price of Bitcoin. Present market conditions offer miners of all sizes an opportunity to procure mining hardware and lock in long-term colocation/hosting contracts at a significant discount. Bitcoin is \~83% off its December 2017 high of $20k, S9 mining rig prices are presently 90% off their January 2018 highs of $2,750/machine, and hosting contract fees are 50-70% off their January 2018 highs of $130-$170/ month rent per S9. Presently, contracts are around $65-$75 / month per S9. That accounts for almost all the fixed cost and variable cost for a miner seeking colocation/hosting services. Entering Bitcoin Mining with these favorable rates is akin to purchasing Bitcoin at $3,500 with a 2+ year hold outlook, as the lifecycle of your hardware and hosting contracts are usually 2-year durations. Many miners with $65-$75 hosting contracts are presently profitable but are close to breakeven. This is uncomfortable and could last several more months but if Bitcoin rises in price these miners will be radically profitable as they have locked in low fixed rates.
3. **Technological innovation continues in Bitcoin Mining:** *Container Solutions* are replacing the warehouse data center model, massively reducing CapEx &amp; OpEx for mining operations which significantly lowers the “break-even” Bitcoin price for miners. Containers are designed specifically for mining and do not require large 30,000+ sqft infrastructure build outs. These lean containers have built-in electrical infrastructure and network gear tailored for PoW Mining.
4. **Cryptocurrencies are not the only asset class presently under pressure:** Equities and traditional ‘risk assets’ appear to be entering their first bear cycle of the Quantitative Easing Era deployed by Global Central Banks. The steady decline in risk assets reflects continued concerns of slowing international growth; as US yield curve inversion and many other macro-economic indicators suggest the possibility of an incoming recession. In these conditions, we have already witnessed established and leading stocks decline by 40% or more. For new, emerging technologies, the correction in bear markets is often much more severe, as we are presently witnessing in cryptocurrencies. To provide context on the scope of macro-economic corrections, it is worth comparing the current Bitcoin Price Correction to the price action of surviving Internet Leaders during the 2002 “Dot Com Bubble” and also compared to present leading stocks in the current correction. When viewed through the lens of a macro-correction, Bitcoin is acting as to be expected for an asset in its early growth life cycle - just as AMZN, CSCO, and AAPL once did.
5. **Predicting the future of a technology solely based on price movements is unwise**: Just as the narrative: "Bitcoin becoming the world currency and replacing Visa" at $BTC $20,000 was foolish, "Bitcoin is dead" at $3,500 is equally as foolish. Many skeptics and speculators are claiming Bitcoin is dead purely based on its deep and volatile market correction. In 2002, similar assertions were directed at CSCO, AAPL, and AMZN who were also pronounced “dead” because there was too much focus on the stock price rather than the ecosystem growth, rate of adoption, and improving fundamentals. From those Dot-Com Bubble “dead lows” to present trading levels, these stocks have returned roughly 390%, 34,000%, and 32,000% respectively.

youd earn about 75/machine per month. so roughly $25k/month. Other costs you need to factor is where you are going to place your machines. Power is 90% of cost so if thats free you have a massive leg up. So calculate earn back on machine cost probably closer to $70k rather than the above post. Then cost for where youre placing your machines although I assume you have that since you have free power. If you already have a ton of effective HVAC then that is of no cost since its just power to run that. IF you need to still HVAC that will require upfront cost and some strategic expertise

There is a lot of data that when a platform holds its incumbency for 10+ years the probability of holding as leader is very favorable

The ASIC Manufacturers are feeling the most pain. GMO is out of business, there are questions of Bitmain's solvency, Halong Dragonmints are completely gone under and are just providing warranty support. We are witnessing pressure/competition on the suppliers which drives done mining rig prices which provides relief to miners. Much was driven by sucked out demand from the market with BTC's price drop but in the future and during the return of a bull market - the more suppliers/competition the better.

Hey Bashco, I initially made the post and immediately made the comment within the thread to show what I believe is the key information but it would not post/populate. maybe\_mike and Prestigious are friends so I asked them to try posting my comment as mine wouldnt populate. I thought there was an issue with my account but there was simply a significant delay. No bots or upvote funny business. I just wanted that content available to everyone but didn't realize there could sometimes be a lag. That is the honest truth. Unsure who timelyforever is and the remaining commentors. Just looking for meaningful discussion from here. Thanks
