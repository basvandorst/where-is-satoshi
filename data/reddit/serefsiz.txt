Coinbase is fine and trustworthy. Fines are a bit high but you have no waiting time converting EUR to BTC and vice versa. I already exchanged thousands of euros, and it always went well

I remember when bitcoin was like ‘high’. It became like $1000. I was sitting at the office and was yelling like ‘thats it! i’m not buying. It can’t get higher!’ I repeated that every day, when it jumped like $500-1000, every time I looked at it. I infected my colleagues, and they were looking too. Every day

Ah I get it. But I think here in germany, it’s more because of the law. Since you must be 18 to purchase bitcoins. And the only way to prove is with an ID. So the ATM company must provide age verification, or it’s ATM is illegal. Yes, welcome to germany

‚I don‘t see why you should be able to legally dodge taxes‘
Lol. I’m no expert, that’s why I’m posting here. But you never heard of Nikes headquarters in Netherlands, or Apple in Ireland. That is all strategy and tactics to dodge taxes. There are a lot more examples. I always hear but don’t remember

I realised that the ATM can more than just purchase Bitcoin. You can order food or drinks with it etc. So maybe they just shut down the bitcoin purchasing function. As the note below says. I last tested it on that day, it officially supposed to work.

The sign below says: available till June 25th, 2019. But it still is there and people are using it.
Myself I don’t use it. I just ‚played‘ with it

This is so true. You really wait weeks for appointments, and if you get one, they don't even listen. Seriously. This counts for legally insured ones. Since doctors don't make much money from them. Of course not every doctor is like that.
But if you are insured privately, they make a lot better money from you, you get very quick appointments, better and more treatments, the doctor will consider more investigations. Since they get paid lot better for anything they do, from the private insurance.
Then the third would be self-payer, where no insurance, nothing is in-between. They are treated the very best. Since there is no cut-off from expenses.
Of course there is worse in other countries, where people don't even have an insurance, nor money to pay the doctor. I know that.   
But in a country like germany, there should be a much better system.   
In my opinion, health care should be globally accessible, and get people treated, no matter if poor or rich, white or black. Health is the most valuable, and no one should die, nor suffer because they were born in a more unfortunate place.
Ps: A little correction. You said we pay legal insurance through taxes. That is not right, but I know you probably just misarticulated.  
In germany we pay the legal health insurance through our "Social benefit" which will be subtracted from our montly wages.  
Health insurance is one of a part. There is also pension insurance, care insurance and more social benefits which will be subtracted from our wages. And besides that social benefits, we also pay taxes.  
So let's say your monthly wage is like 3000€, then you will only get like 2000€ on your hands. And that every month. (There are factors, which will vary the percentages of taxes you pay. Like if you're married etc)  
Why do you guys think, that the rich people from germany move out to Switzerland or Lichtenstein, or Luxembourg. It's because of the high taxes etc. of germany.  
I just posted this for everyone who is not from germany. So they can have a little more insight of this system

haha how? It’s shot at June 25th. And I never posted it

Never seen something like that. Maybe you can name some, or some providers

the old good classic one: Berliner Flughafen. The funny thing (but rather sad) is, that they have to run that airport even though no one is there, just to maintain that the machines, lights etc. don't get broken, because of no long use.Which costs extra electricity, personal etc.. And guess who is paying for it? For the mistake made by the state, hiring some idiot who planned that airport to build. :D  
So when I make mistakes by buying bitcoins and losing money. Who is gonna pay for my mistake? Of course. Me.
It is ridiculous.

@_date: 2019-12-21 19:26:11
Yes. Read my other comments. I mentioned it there
@_date: 2019-12-14 21:35:27
sorry but this is so pathetic. I always read ‘now it will moon’ blabla bla.
just saying it for self confirmation, and putting others in wrong beliefs, so they start buying, and eventually getting the market bullish
@_date: 2019-12-21 02:29:07
hence that -36%
@_date: 2019-12-28 09:36:11
Didn’t know that. But currently it is about 35-40%. Depending on your income

This ones standing in a gambling hall anyway. No
matter what you stand in front. You will feel embarrassed. I entered because that thing was seen from outside, and the door said, that you can buy bitcoins here
@_date: 2019-12-22 02:11:35
haha this one stands in a gambling hall. Like the one in Berlin stands in a sportsbet hall
So they associate it with ‚gambling‘
@_date: 2019-12-22 02:36:57
what is KYC? I didn’t purchase from it anyway. I’m using Coinbase. It’s safer than all the chinese exchanges, worked well so far, and only haa 1.49% fee’s
@_date: 2019-12-21 16:55:28
The ATM is provided by  as it says on the top. It’s a austrian IT company

When I read about the Bitcoin ATM situation in germany. If I recall right, it got forbidden here for a while. There was confusion. But as I saw earlier in this subreddit, someone posted one in Berlin. So it might got legal now, to have a Bitcoin ATM in germany.
The certain thing is, austria has got a lot of Bitcoin ATM‘s. There’s even a website where you can see where a ATM is located
