Why do you think it ceased to be secure?

Why are you even talking about the Tor Project's funding as if that was a malicious thing?

That was a LEAKED internal presentation for the NSA, do you think there's some conspiracy and they're making up lies in their own presentation?
I am perfectly OK with you continuing to use Tor, by the way. I just think that people should have the facts to make their own decision, rather than having something like this slipped in to a download like Open Bizarre without even knowing any better.
Do you agree that if you use the Internet without any intermediary then all of your activities are logged?

Which particular flaw? 


That's a flaw in Firefox, which was fixed.

Yes, exit nodes can see the traffic or the encrypted traffic (in case of HTTPS), but they can't see the traffic of say an onion service because it's end to end encrypted.

No, you just assumed that the NSA put lies in their own internal presentations, you didn't address it.


My answer to question B is of course. However, most of what can be gathered, if being done without a warrant would not be admissible in court. This is why intentionally signing your name on the Tor warrant is, in my opinion, not very smart, as it makes pretty much everything that can be gathered about you in any way admissible in court, AND puts you on a "PLEASE look at me" list.
There is not such thing as a "Tor warrant". The logs that your ISP keeps is already admissible in court.
It seems your whole point spins around a misunderstanding of Rule 41.

What warrant are you talking about? If you're talking about rule41 then no, that's not even its meaning.

Can you show proof that the NSA and GCHQ are financing the Tor Project? (I said NSA and GCHQ, not the National Science Foundation or something else)
@_date: 2017-02-15 09:17:51


No, they don't.
@_date: 2017-02-15 09:32:40
Why would they even do that? That's a big waste of time and money. It serves nothing really. If they want to de-anonymize people they just have to hack a hidden service server and then add a firefox exploit there that calls home, as they did with many previous cases.

I did not find there any proof that those we are, by your own words, trying to "outsmart" (ie mass surveillance by NSA and GCHQ), developed and funded the Tor Project.
I did however find proof that the NSA considers Tor to be "the king of low latency anonymity systems", and that they can only de-anonymize "a very small fraction of Tor users", and that they will never be able to de-anonymize all users all the time.

Yeah, Snowflake could definitely be a big improvement.

Do you have any update on the current status of meek in China? It seems they have been very successful at limiting them  And countries like Kazakhstan are said to have been completely able to block obfs2, 3, 4, and meek.
