Log scale... emphasizes relative growth as opposed to absolute (linear) growth. Has been fairly accurate for predicting bitcoins growth so far actually so... ya pretty legit
@_date: 2018-01-18 04:12:46
Graphs don't predict the price, people do. Graph's help people predict the price
There's no information in a linear scale that isn't also available in a log scale, with that said other graphs make certain details more noticeable.
A log scale will make exponential growth look linear, bitcoins growth has so far been entirely exponential, which is why it's log graph looks linear. Of course past performance doesn't prove future performance, but that statement doesn't prove it's impossible to make predictions. Be skeptical, that's good. But if in the last 9 years bitcoin has held a linear trend line on a log graph do you think it might hold for the next, say, year?

Of course everyone has their own view points, I wouldn't want to assume that you necessarily coincide with those at who take Satoshiis word as gospel, but if you do then this statement from the white paper might interest you


The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
the proof-of-work.
However I do agree that this same argument can be made with regards to LN
Still though, with all things held equal, aren't LN transactions still cheaper?
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:57:12

You don't need to be connected to the Bitcoin network to create a wallet
A wallet contains public and private encryption key pairs
Public and private encryption key pairs allow you to receive Bitcoin, , send Bitcoin, and sign messages
Public and private key pairs are generated to be statistically unique
If you have a method of generating random Numbers (such as with using multiple dice)then you can basically follow all the programmed instructions inside a wallet program to generate your key pairs 'by hand'

Let's say the average LN network transaction takes 5 seconds to complete, with the average bch transaction to take 10 minutes, not only is LN 18,000 times cheaper, it's 120 times quicker as well
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:08:57
Increasing the block size raises the requirements to run a node while offering higher transactions per second. If you want more decentralization lower the block size, but that will decrease the tps.
It's about finding balance, too low and the network stalls. Too high and you jeopardize the integrity of the network. But fortunately consumer electornics get cheaper and cheaper every year. 2MB should almost certainly be the norm by 2020, and shouldn't impact decentralization too much.
Lightning off-loads transactions on to a secondary layer which get settled on the block chain at a later time. Lightning Network offers more efficiency at the cost of a more centralized system (although technically it's entirely possible to have a decentralized LN). If you don't want to use the LN that's ok, it'll still help the network because transactions are still being off-loaded so you will have more space to yourself on the block chain
In short, it's not so binary as to say an increased block size will centralize the network, but rather  how much will it centralize the network?

Fwiw this transaction had 0.02% in fees. As Bitcoin grows in value then you'd just spend less bitcoin to order something.
In terms scaling as usage increases, take a look at the core roadmap. I'm most excited for schnorr signatures and drive chain. Additionally some members of the core community (such as luke-jr) mentioned increasing the blocksize in a few years after these other upgrades. That would help not only the base layer increase transactions but also the lightning network

Hate to burst your bubble, but logically speaking he's right.
It's a little backwards because instead of using implications you're using 'beause' instead, which changes the order of logic but not it's meanings. Anyways I'm going to convert everything into a series of logical propositions
Let A be the proposition that people compete against each other to earn Bitcoin
Let B be the proposition that Bitcoin is run by people who donate electricity to verify the truth of the network
Let C be the proposition that Bitcoin is Secure
Let D be the proposition that Bitcoin is valuable
If D implies A, and A implies B, then B implies C. Therefore, D
Your hypothesis is your conclusion, you haven't proven anything you haven't assumed.
It might make more sense to phrase it as if B exists as a true statement for a sufficient amount of time, then it follows that A and C. If A and C, therefore D granted D is not necessarily true for all values.

I would say download electrum wallet onto your computer or phone, and move the coins to that wallet before the fork occurs. After the fork occurs (All coins said they implemented proper replay protection) you can safely move your bitcoin back to coinbase. The forked coins you own that you were accredited after the fork occurs are associated with the private keys of the electrum wallet on your phone or PC, when a compatible wallet is released for the forked coins you can use your private key(s) to claim them

I think a more accurate statement would be that block chain without an incentivized token is uninteresting. Block chain is a decentralized autonomous database, but when that database becomes backed by Bitcoin , which gives that database value, then we see the true importance of both techs.

I would mind if Segwit were the final blocksize increase ever. Big blockers do have some valid points and if we are to be the more mature community we need to understand them. Technology is constantly improving so while big blocks today isn't a necessity that isn't to say we can implement them when the costs to maintain a bigger blockchain goes down. Of course I want Schnorr signatures + MAST + LN before a blocksize increase, but a blocksize increase itself would improve the lightning network as well

Let's assume Vladimir Putin has 200 billion dollars and Satoshi has 1 million coins. Each coin would have to be worth 200,000$. Let's say bitcoin appreciates by a factor of 1.5x every 8 months, we're at roughly 3,000$ ATM, so 3000 * 1.5^x = 200,000, or x =10.36, so 80 months

Depends on who's the analyst. There are some arguments you can make to try to understand the overall nature of how things might turn out, but you're right that most of those techniques aren't in drawing arrows.
here's a way (not the only way) to try and model the behavior. Obviously creating an exact equation is impossible, but let's try to derive how it might "probably" behave.
For example, while the price is increasing over some time period, we assume the probability of the price to decrease increases
However, as the price is decreasing for some large period of time, we assume the probability of the price to increase increases
But those assumptions only draw from the value of the price, there are other variables we can use.
For example, what if we tried to model a function which estimates the value of the network as being proportional to the number of users. This is a fair assumption because bitcoin is a network it benefits from the network effect. If there is 1 person on the network, only 1 person can communicate with themselves. But with more people come more permutations, and I believe the growth goes as n\^2.
We can also make observations, such as how the price looks linear under a log plot. Maybe a function which can very crudely approximate the behavior of bitcoin would roughly look like some exponentiated value as a function of the growth, times the function derived from setting up the differential equation described above. I'm too lazy to put in that work, but from the looks of it it might be sin and cos solutions, so maybe there are some set of frequencies of importance if we were to take the fourier decomposition of that nasty graph. Most of it will be noise though, but it wouldn't be crazy if we noticed some frequencies, such as bitcoin block halving rate, having larger associated amplitudes to those frequencies.
But honestly all that analysis is probably a waste, there are better tools to make predictions

Not a nube question but I can't promise my answer is 100% accurate or is the complete truth
With that said...
Part of investing in Bitcoin is what country you're in. Venezuelans are more likely to.use Bitcoin than Americans because Bitcoin is consistently dominating their home currency. Buying more Bitcoin now makes a lot more sense if you live in Argentina than it does elsewhere.
Additionally, there are still many hurdles Bitcoin needs to cross. Bitcoin appreciating in value means that people inevitably find value in it. Just because the rate of which Bitcoins are added into circulation decreases, if there's no one who wants to buy those coins they will still be worthless
So the question is will Bitcoin succeed? Maybe some other crypto currency which doesn't suffer **FROM A FUCKING SCALING DEBATE FOR TWO FUCKING YEARS** will overtake Bitcoin as the dominant currency and all our investments in Bitcoin depreciate.
The last factor I can consider is that the price of Bitcoin naturally results from supply and demand. However, supply and demand are very rarely static quantities and are more often rates of change. It isn't "how many bitcoins do I buy" which determines demand, but "how many Bitcoins *per week*" which determines demand. Likely, those who are aware of Bitcoin and have invested time researching it will enter an equilibrium with their demand, and the price will appreciate a very small amount from that one individual, and eventually balance out.
Plus, there are a few barriers behind getting involved with Bitcoin. The majority of the population isnt computer literate, let alone financially literate enough, to get a wallet set up for themselves. I personally wouldn't invest large sums of my money into something I don't vaguely understand

I'm done with this debate, whatever, 8mb fine go ahead this is all bullshit we can Segwit afterwards can't we? Why do we hate bigger blocks? Why can't we have both
@_date: 2017-04-17 03:50:08


Right, but bitcoin as a network can be upgraded to handle more users. Personally I want segwit for it's optimization of handling transactions and to later implement LN, as well as bigger block so that we can increase throughput and lower TX fees on the main network for people who prefer the most decentralized method
@_date: 2017-04-09 20:20:17
This will be layer running on top of Bitcoin. One layer is faster and more practical for tinier transactions at the cost of being slightly more centralized. If you don't mind waiting for a block to.be confirmed, sending it through the blockchain will still be a decentralized option

No, bitcoin is a decentralized anonymous cryptocurrency which offers a unique upgrade path through UASF, MASF, and hard forks. This isn't war, there is no need for drama.
I directly referenced a lot of comments of people who are having a genuine open discussion in the pursuit of what's best for bitcoin. Today, SegWit might be best for bitcoin, maybe it's not, but there's no reason in being hostile towards people who are openly discussing the current economic climate and are trying to make an informed decision
I hope I haven't come on as too harsh or rough around the edges, like sarcasm, it can be very hard to pronounce a tone of respect over the internet, so I want to emphasize that now.
@_date: 2017-04-06 03:27:38
Ok, those are all fair points. I will agree that bitcoin can be seen as a battleground
May I be correct then, in assuming, that when we describe "Us vs Them" then the Us refers to the economic majority, and the them refers to scammers, alt-coin developers, and the puppet masters behind them (such as Roger Ver and Jiahn Wu) but *not* including the pawns they try to manipulate, such as some of the people at @_date: 2018-03-12 22:55:20
I understand my use of saying "do bad" sounds rather stupid but I'm going after the general and subjective idea of bad. Good and bad are very relative and subjective, so given a socially interactive program such as bitcoin how do you settle these disputes?
Tackling your first point


Case I: it's not bad, it's good because the miner is making more money. This implies more money is good. Since the miner is setting a minimum fee, they are attempting to charge more, therefore the users have less money. If more money is good, then it's not good to not have more money.  If the miner is setting a minimum fee, then we do not have more money, therefore this is bad for users.
Case II: it is bad, see Case I.
So how should we decide what's a good amount to set fees at? Easy, let the market decide, as we have been before. Except by setting a price floor you are ignoring market value... 
The good news is f2pool ignored market value for too long and started losing money, so they changed their habits to reflect market value.
As for your second point


If there is a way to prevent miners from abusing users fees without jeopardizing their fair share of economic freedom then I'm all for it obviously. But part of the protocol is this economic freedom. Transactions will still get processed, the protocol is still usable (as well as in development) so I don't understand how you can substantiate the claim the the protocol rules are broken to begin with. This is a critique on a subjective issue of economic freedom vs the abuse that might ensue.
So how does bitcoin settle these subjective issues? With the users running nodes. And if people don't like an aspect of the network, then fork away. If enough people agree with your subjective view point, it becomes the network protocol. (Such as upgrading transaction capacity via segwit as opposed to a blocksize increase).
Again, if your only point is that there is no authority preventing them from being pricks therefore it's ok they are pricks then why do you think we have anything against the protocol and not the pricks?

Profit is best considered as profit per unit of time, that's what you want to maximize. You can wait 6 months for a miner to pay itself off or you can sell it immediately and make profit today. Maximizing profit in this scenario comes from a combination of using some of your miners indefinitely and selling the others

Why is this performance boost called an attack?
[–]hairy_unicorn 50 points 3 hours ago
 
It aligns incentives for the patent holder to act against protocol improvements that would disrupt ASICBOOST. That's an attack in my book.
[–]tl121 21 points 2 hours ago 
I will comment on the Greg's use of the words "covert" and "attack".
Some words come with different meanings when used in different contexts. Beware of entering into moral and ethical arguments with people known to play verbal shell games with ambiguous terms.
There is nothing immoral or illegal about calculating an established mathematical function more efficiently by developing a more efficient algorithm or more efficient hardware. Calling this an "attack" may be common terminology among cryptographers, but outside of this narrow field such an improvement would not come with negative connotations.
In product development it is common for technology to be kept proprietary. Various terms apply here, such as "secret recipie" or "trade secret". None of these come with negative moral or ethical connotations. In a game of poker there is no obligation to reveal the contents of one's hole cards. To do so would be foolish. In more esoteric areas such as military communications and espionage, the phrase "covert" has either positive or negative connotations according to which side is doing it.
[–]3_Thumbs_Up 13 points 1 hour ago 
I agree that this should not be labeled as an attack. It's still a vulnerability of Bitcoin's incentive structure though, as it incentivizes miners against all protocol upgrades that commit to a certain order of transactions.

[–]Contrarian__ 6 points 1 hour ago 
SegWit and a ton of other potential improvements to bitcoin, including non-delayed UTXO commitments, committed bloom filters, committed address indexes, non-delayed STXO commitments, weak blocks, and most kinds of fraud proofs.
Imagine someone discovered a similar 'attack' that improved mining efficiency by a ton, but prevented bitcoin from ever increasing the blocksize limit. All miners quickly adopt it, essentially forever preventing a blocksize increase. Tell me you wouldn't cry foul.

Can we ask a miner to not optimise code and hardware ? Thats would be like asking a fisherman to stop using better skills than the others fishermen because thats unfair
Miner will do all in their power to optimise, thats how POW works
[–]severact 13 points 1 hour ago 
Optimizing is fine. The potential issue though is that bitmain optimized in a way that makes there chips incompatible with most protocol upgrades, and thus gives them huge financial incentive to be against such upgrades (for all the wrong reasons).
I don't even think this is necessarily an invalid reason to be against an upgrade, but I think they should be upfront about it.
[–]FUBAR-BDHR 11 points 3 hours ago 
Seriously what is the difference between bitmain having a patent on asicboos and Intel having one on say hyper-threading? Should all of Intel chips been banned back in the CPU days because they held a patent? This is an attack plain and simple.

Are you trolling or are you really not getting it? Maybe you really don't know because you did not follow the whole scaling debate. It now comes it that Jihan took the Bitcoin community and Bitcoin's evolution hostage for so long, for wrong reason, solely for his own financial benefit of up to 100 Mill USD/year.
It's ok to be a business man. But it's not ok to misuse the consensus structure of a decentralized system (Bitcoin) with lies to make absurd amounts of own profit.
[–]olliey 55 points 4 hours ago 
You guys should be really really angry:
Jihan runs the asicboost improvement covertly to gain an efficiency advantage. Segwit would remove this efficiency advantage.
This is his agenda. He does not care about the block size. He is a businessman. He cares only about getting more money. Doesn't that piss you off?
[–]sandakersmann [-1] 10 points 2 hours ago 
Miners optimizing mining is natural and ASICBOOST is not a secret. Have you ever heard of secret patents? BlockstreamCore devs releasing covert updates to the protocol that blows up some miners businesses is bad. How can miners trust them after this?
[–]Amichateur 7 points an hour ago 
Jihan lied about his true motives. He cares about his extra profit of up to 100 Mill USD/year thanks to his ASICBOOST ASICs, not about scaling. For such an amount of money, it is no surprise that he lied to the world about his true motives.
Now it's up to each of us to decide what we consider more important: Bitcoin's future or Jihan's personal financial goals. I, personally, have no difficulty to decide what is more important to me.

Yeah, with the mining difficulty increasing at a steady rate that means the luck of his miner goes down over time meaning profits decreases with time. Typically it's more profitable to just spend the money you were gonna spend on a miner on Bitcoin and let it appreciate in value. In either scenario, you're spending fist to "earn Bitcoin" except you'll probably profit more just buy buying the Bitcoin in the first place

Right, that's why we implement upgrades to increase the capacity and scalability of the network.
What you'll find with most things is that the answer to a problem will easily seem to be a dichotomy of two extremes, when in reality the truth is somewhere in between. 0 fees is dangerous and extremely high fees is ridiculous and not practical. Some fees have to be paid, especially in a hundred or so years when block rewards end and the only "reward" left for the miners are the transaction fees

While he doesn't speak for everyone, IIRC mentioned 2020 a while ago (I had asked him of his opinion on a block-size upgrade a while ago).
A little over 2 years sounds like a while, but consider what we should have by then. Schnorr signatures will greatly reduce TX sizes and make spamming the network much more expensive by making all transactions roughly the same size regardless of how many signatures are required on a transaction. I think if we should implement Schnorr signatures first if we are to upgrade the blocksize.
We also will have LN by 2020, which will free up space on the network for more transactions.
We already have 2MB blocks provided by Segwit because of the block weight advantage. If you compound that advantage with a real 2MB blocksize increase you end up with 4-8MB blocks.
Bitcoin is more active in weak economic regions. Not coincidentally these regions have more broadband restrictions which make operating a node more costly.
But that doesn't mean we'll keep pushing back the upgrade date indefinitely, it's much more likely it'll be thrown in with a hardfork which includes many other upgrades to the network. But should we commit to a hardfork only for the sake of a blocksize increase? No, that would inefficient and reckless.

Let's say you have a quantum computer and want to steal some coins, I'm going to assume this is a newish development so it's not a particularly super powerful quantum computer but still you have it's abilities
So maybe you'll start with cracking transactions already on the block chain? Well, the structure of the block chain is resistant to this. You don't necessarily "know" where the Bitcoins are, those transactions recorded only tell you where I've spent the coins, not where I hold them. They're like receipts
However, if your computer is fast enough (which it probably isn't but you're ambitious so fuck it) maybe you can try and crack transactions which aren't on the block chain yet and then double spending them. In that case you would need to crack ECDSA
But, when computers get that powerful, Bitcoin will have already upgraded to a stronger more secure cryptographic algorithm, who knows, maybe that algorithm will be produced by a quantum computer

I think an important note to emphasize in that animal analagy is that eastern culture has a more collective mindset as opposed to America's individualistic mindset.
An individual mindset values the needs of the individual over the needs of others, as it's assumed others will take care of their needs as well as needs are diverse and subjective
A collectivist mindset values the needs of the group over the needs of the individual, believing it would be selfish to place the needs of an individual first over, say, the needs of the family.
So in a way it makes sense to envision the self as a rat or ant as opposed to a more flattering self image as that of a lion or bear, a single ant is nothing,  but gains power through their unity

Not necessarily. If we never increase the block size then Layer 1 bitcoin will have increasingly higher TX fees and congestion, if we only implement Segwit/LN and never increase the block size then the only feasible transactions will be layer 2, and we all agree LN is inherently more centralized than layer 1, but at the cost of being faster.
The best way to maintain decentralization is to to implement layer 2 solutions, but we can't only have layer 2 solutions, we need to increase the block-size as well. If we increase it to fast consumer technology will be outpaced and lead to miner centralization. We need to increase it slowly so consumer technology scales with bitcoin

The thing whiched iffed me about it is how Jihan Wu still has enough mining power to veto Segwit later on in the compromise and effectively only enforce the hardfork, if Segwit 2x is supposed to be compatible with bip148, then even if Jihan vetod it the people running bip 148 nodes can still preserve the blockchain with the remaining mining power already prepared to process Segwit pools will still be hashing for the Segwit pools, and we'll still have a strong enough mining presence to maintain as the dominant chain
Bip 148 just to be safe, if the NYA ends up being honest then great, nothing happens. If it's dishonest and betrays the agreement we'll still have honored our side of the deal. It costs us nothing secures so much

There are 3 important aspects to argumentation, pathos, logos, and ethos. Emotional arguments, logical arguments, and credibility. 4 ~~day~~ week accounts have no credibility

I believe if bitcoin were to succeed as a global decentralized currency then volatility would end. Right now there is volatility comparing bitcoin to a fist currency which is dominating it in market value. What would the volatility of bitcoin look like if it had the market value of USD ? Additionally, if it replaces USD then wouldn't 1 bitcoin always equal 1 Bitcoin, instead of comparing it's value as relative to some arbitrary currency
