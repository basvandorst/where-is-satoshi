so glad you posted this, especially when comes in talking about "how strong of a community we all are"
anyone who knows anything about cryptos needs to stay away from cryptsy.

like i mentioned to i only keep a small balance in multibit for quick transactions. i tried searching this sub for related problems but didn't find another thread. if the problem is as widespread as you've implied, why aren't more people talking about it?
not being critical, just wondering.

no, it does not. 
the 0.2 BTC transaction has also disappeared from the log within multibit after i reset the blockchain within the client.

i always send with a fee, and the the 0.2 BTC only showed up in my transaction log; it never appeared on blockchain and was stuck with the triangle symbol (broadcast failure). after resetting the blockchain within multibit, my balance now reads 1.3 BTC with no "spendable balance" below it and the 0.2 BTC transaction no longer appears in the log.

on two addresses i have associated with the wallet, the balances are 1.03 BTC and 0.87 BTC, the others are empty. i guess i started with 2.1 BTC?
the multibit client still shows a balance of 1.3 BTC and says it is synchronized with the network. 
is there anything i can do?

just made the switch based on this experience. i don't really keep up with bitcoin news, i just buy BTC and spend them whenever i need to. if i had known about this before, i would have switched a long time ago.

sorry, i only looked at hits for multibit within the last month thinking it was a more common issue.

i keep a small balance of bitcoins in multibit for quick transactions, everything else in a cold wallet.

i will look into it now and try it once i've comfortable with all the steps. my only interaction with BTC is through multibit and having a cold wallet, so my knowledge concerning how all this works is very minimal. 
i appreciate your help, and will let you know if i get my BTC back.
