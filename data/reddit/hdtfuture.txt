What does that mean? I posted that commit above...with this account. This is actually my only account on Reddit. My very first day on here, only because the Bitcoin is here in the Forum.
and yes, I wrote $7,000 and Changed it because the thief stole $30,000....

I am new as of today to this forum, I am here because the Bitcoin Thief is well known in this forum, and he passes himself off as a "Bitcoin Professional" 
I was there when this interrogation took place. He would not admit it for hours, then once he did we offered him to help him pay back the money if he would just do some type penance and he refused.
Now he back on Facebook and this forum "helping" other people invest in bitcoin.

I am new to Reddit, but I always thought trolls where people who just randomly called names to people in a topic, really not adding anything to it.  Or people who just had no thoughts and were just dumping insults in a kind of low-thought-energy kinda way. 
Is that not the case here?

How would you bring attention to this guy?
Isn't it clear that's the real goal here?

Yes, I am posting this here because the thief is here. 
I am a not a Reddit user, new profile today(but I have read many threads for info and know this is a smart place, cutting, but smart peoples at times)
I personally know the Thief and the Victim, I know their voices, know the thief by his picture's in the video( he ran for public office in the Ron Paul circles and so its easy to know its really him, in both his voice, the video.
But I also saw the trading transactions on the BTC-E accounts he setup for this victim, and then stole from after offering his services.
And there are more reasons I know this is 100% real.
This is not Begging for bitcoin, but this is a good way to bring attention to a Thief operating right here in this forum.

I agree with you 100% Just not on the part about this guy getting found out...I would be okay with that, just hope it leads to this family getting some funds back...that would be cool.
@_date: 2013-12-23 03:22:36
He actually is pulling the same stuff right now. A few days ago warning people about bitcoin thief's etc on his Facebook.
Clearly he states in the video that this is a way to try and re-coup some of the money stolen from this family... and honestly I am with you...release the video, this guy 100% for sure is "helping" others right now.

Is there already one?
The main reason for posting this here, is that this person is well known in this Forum....myself and the person who had the $30K stolen are not...for both of us its our first post.
@_date: 2013-12-23 04:26:04
I know all of the people in this video the Thief and the victim.
@_date: 2013-12-23 02:33:15
This Video is 100% legit....I know it for a fact.
@_date: 2013-12-23 03:08:27
I did just because this was a family of 5 that had $30,000 stolen from them. Its just an added bonus that it will lead to the release of the full video.
@_date: 2013-12-23 02:58:28
This guy admitted to stealing the bitcoins, then other peoples as well...then went right back to Facebook "helping people" with bitcoin buying/selling. 
We were thinking about government regulations vs. just community, or self regulation.
