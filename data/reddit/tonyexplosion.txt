For me it's essentially the same. But with my mass. Its cultivating nicely. Gotta good crop of cultivated mass coming in.

coinbase has margin trading capabilities if you want to sign up for it. it's an additional product on top of coinbase.

How do you get testnet bitcoins? I'm interested in setting up a node for the test net for practice. These main net guys are cool. But I'll practice first. How many BTC do you need? I assume any amount, but the more you have the more channels you can set up right?

still the age of GPU mining and FPGA proof of concept asic miners.

My raspberry pi 3 arrived yesterday and I'm in the process of setting up the testnet lightning network stuff. I got the link to the testnet faucet and plan on buying some coffee when I get it set up. I was wondering if there were any test net apps that you can use. Are there any others that are fun to play with and spend test coins at?

The next multi day drop in the stock market is going to be incredible to witness. There was that one day where trump threatened a private citizen on twitter because it went down just a little bit.

There are channels advertising low to negative fees to get the routes through them.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:30:39
That was going to be my next few questions after I got my lighting network test net setup going. I got a link where to get coins, then, what to do to spend them.

Different arrangements of transactions or extra signature data will change the merkle tree and the top level merkle hash in the block header. If you run out of nonces to try you can mash the merkle tree up a bit (this is memory and processor intensive) and try the set of nonces again. Or try a different set of transactions. It used to be that the protocol would give you the header to work on and everyone would try the same set of nonces. That kind of ended with GPU mining because the miners needed the ability to craft their own blocks on the fly to hash, instead of asking the network for what it thinks the next block should be.

Just for reference, the guy who paid for the pizzas posted on a forum, and someone in a different country called the pizza place and put in the order with their fiat.
So someone got 10,000 BTC for calling in a pizza order. It wasn't even for the pizza technically.

There are soft forks required I thought.

I'm confused. Was this all done on the testnet with test coins? Is the coffee shop real? I don't know what is real anymore.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:47:11
Fees are fees. Do you get refunded that fee if you cancel your order?

Lol just like that saved by the bell episode.

This may seem like a dumb question. But once you get KYC'd at another exchange, you can just move your bitcoins from one exchange to another through the blockchain and pay a ridiculous fee but the bitcoins could potentially be moved much faster than cashing out, back to bank, then back into the new exchange?
I'm pretty new at this and didn't know that Coinbase was being a shit heel. Knowing this I probably would have wen't with a different exchange. Going through KYC again doesn't sound fun. But It sounds like coinbase doesn't really want to trade or exchange bitcoins anymore.

Different alt coins have hashing algorithms that are ASIC resistant. Like litecoin uses scrypt instead of sha256 and has a huge memory footprint. I believe this is the same with Ethereum's hashing algorithm. To implement it in an asic miner would require adding a few gigabytes of ram to each individual chip which heavily inflates cost yada yada yada.
sha256 is fast for asics because it can be accomplished by all integer operations.

0.25% for limit orders? Damn.

that is axiomatically impossible.

 Is that red stair step around 12920 the sell wall? I don't know how that graph works.

LOL BCH resembles bitcoin more than LN because they literally did nothing more than change the name and tiny amount of hashing details.
I'd call it Lazy Coin if I could. But being lazy would have produced a better coin.

How do you negotiate open channels with other nodes? Is that automatic or something that you need to get in a chat room and get the address and work out the details of how much is going in the channel?

They get to keep 0.25% of all market transactions. In terms of transaction volume when there is a dip the transaction volume doubles to triples. Right now it is just shy of 100k bitcoins in 24 hours. That's like way, way more than it has been since the start of january.
