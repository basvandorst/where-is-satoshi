Hey, now -- Bitcoin's great, but blockchains as a data structure have a lot of implications that are important for these people. They may well not have the best of intentions, but they may also fund research that helps us understand how to use blockchains. 
I sometimes feel like there's a bitcoin-good-other-use-bad mindset here when it comes to blockchains, and that's something I can't explain.

Glad I'm not the only person seeing it!

For balance, to complete that paragraph:
"Many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users of CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy."

Oh, absolutely. But the title of the post seemed to make out that the state is wrong to try to slow or halt the spread of crypto-anarchy. Whether it is or not I can't say, but the rest of that paragraph actually makes out that the state could have legitimate concerns, and that there are obstacles which need to be tackled.

Isn't the problem here entirely to do with the merchant?

Even if they don't, it'd be a good way to learn to use the APIs. Do you have to write something that'll get used? I'd have thought that a personal project might be better for starting out with payment tech...
