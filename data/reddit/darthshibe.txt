Huh? Wow, aren't you a little cynical today?  I have a legit question.  If its something that the community believes is unimportant then that is an answer to my question.  Perhaps if you were not hiding behind the veil of the internet you would be more respectful to people asking questions instead of answering like a jerk.  For your information it doesn't go into effect until April.  Since I am new to the community I didn't realize someone already asked that but since there are possibly over 3 billion people in this world with internet access it is certainly possible someone else had already asked this very question.

Yes. I really do.
If you have coin miners at home and their ISPs start making changes perhaps they could be affected.
I think you take advantage of you anonymity to be a dick is all. Have a good weekend.

I'm not as well versed as some people. I don't appreciate the way you are trying to teach me a lesson. I asked the question because I am trying to learn more about the technology. If you are so smart and don't see a problem moving forward then say so. If you just plan on being a condescending jerk then please stop replying to me.

I hope this attitude wins you friends and respect in the future.

Is this the same as mining?

I don't fully understand the way the Fiat system works but I use it every day.  Don't we want Bitcoin and other crypto coins to join the mainstream? Your attitude is what keeps people from the.mainstrram joining. I have done some reading on how Cryptocurrency works but at a certain point I don't understand. People who spend dollars don't need to know how everything works to ask what Trump's policies will do to the value of the dollar.
It's clear there are many smug jerks like you who want to teach the world a lesson from their point of view who will turn many potential users of the crypto completely off. This is a very unhelpful attitude. I may be late to the game but every reaction like this one is a step in the wrong direction.
