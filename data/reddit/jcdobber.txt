Gambler's Fallacy
When it comes to probability, a lack of understanding can lead to incorrect assumptions and predictions about the onset of events. One of these incorrect assumptions is called the gambler's fallacy. 
In the gambler's fallacy, an individual erroneously believes that the onset of a certain random event is less likely to happen following an event or a series of events. This line of thinking is incorrect because past events do not change the probability that certain events will occur in the future.
For example, consider a series of 20 coin flips that have all landed with the "heads" side up. Under the gambler's fallacy, a person might predict that the next coin flip is more likely to land with the "tails" side up. This line of thinking represents an inaccurate understanding of probability because the likelihood of a fair coin turning up heads is always 50%. Each coin flip is an independent event, which means that any and all previous flips have no bearing on future flips.

Maybe he saw you crying about not responding in 30 minutes and didn't feel like he wanted to respond anymore.
@_date: 2014-08-16 13:34:09
They don't care and never will. Change will not come from them. They will just accept any change or no change at all when it happens
@_date: 2014-12-21 12:32:39
Actually 
@_date: 2014-09-26 09:15:45
This is when I got interested in bitcoin. Was going to buy and then I was like, have to wire money to Japan, never mind. I did buy a year later at $17 though

Yes, Thank you. I will check that out, setup a website and start talking to my solicitor. I really feel i should start doing something to help the Bitcoin economy. This will make it possible for people the pay their rents in Bitcoin and make it possible to start investing it in property.

I was trying to find a chart that showed the cost per transaction is USD overtime. Could not find it so I created one. Using data from blockchain.info
@_date: 2015-07-22 23:51:19
Somewhere between 5000 and 10000 usd I think
@_date: 2015-07-12 10:58:10
If enough people believe it and act on it.

@_date: 2017-04-14 17:38:45
Don't do it..
@_date: 2017-04-20 21:42:02
Probably more difficult to get fiat out the exchanges. so people use bitcoin to get their money out. Bitcoin demand increases and arbitrage is not possible to equalise prizes. We saw the same thing with gox. Not a good sign 
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:24:01
No it took us 100,030 years to go to the moon

@_date: 2015-11-04 01:25:34
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:41:11
But these are not new nodes right? Because i do not see a big jump here: 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:54:11
And this was not the case when it dropped from 1100 to 800 or from 1300 to 900?
@_date: 2015-10-18 04:07:11
I am buying now because stability 
@_date: 2015-10-18 17:54:25
So what happens to my investment when you die?
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:24:06

Most countries in europe
@_date: 2017-05-19 23:07:38
Off course it is a bubble.. But it could reach 6000 before dropping back to 2000 again.
@_date: 2017-05-19 13:49:01
Bitfinex does not count they are not using USD
@_date: 2017-05-02 13:29:07
Not really, because instant dollar transfers between exchanges is not possible

These are not the top searches, but the top trending searches. People are still searching for dogs 7x as much as bitcoin for example. Never the less, still impressive.

Isn't there a person selling for every person that is buying?

Same as what happens to your buried gold.

Any idea what rent is like in Hong Kong? This is pretty nor normal size
@_date: 2015-10-30 23:13:02
You always see this argument but isn't their still a cost because of the spread between buy and sell?

That's what happens when you ban the memes on they will popup in another form. That's how the free market works
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:18:38
What Blockchain are they using?

I use Lego wallets, The best way to store Bitcoin in my opinion. In comparison to steel cheaper and reusable.
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:50:14
That's because holland biggest home delivery website started using bitcoin. So a lot of home delivery company's are starting to appear. I am note sure if they belong on the map as you can not pay then directly. 
You still could order the pizza on the delivery website on the location :)

There will be a time when we don't need to deal with banks anymore. To get there quicker don't try to convert your BTC back to fiat and just spend them. And try to earn bitcoin somehow
@_date: 2013-08-20 06:44:36
Best investment advice i have seen in a long time.
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:37:27
Never sell (Why would you want to change bitcoin to fiat if you believe it to be a better currency) and always have a buy order ready at 60% of the price to catch the massive drops.
@_date: 2013-05-14 19:12:00
ooo Yes please :D
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:35:03
Not that instant as Bitcoin has been around for a while
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:21:56
I could not find this piechart so I made it. 
It would be interesting to see what the percentage of a cryptocurrency in relation to the total will look like in a chart.
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:54:43
Just ignore them as much as possible try to live without them.  They will go away
@_date: 2013-07-14 23:59:19
Lego would also be a option :)

Not more than 1%
@_date: 2013-10-28 01:31:00
You also have to keep in mind that most online Chinese only have a mobile phone.  Not a desktop computer. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:52:12
So i have to type in the full encrypted private key into bitaddress.com? That's inconvenient :(
@_date: 2013-07-15 00:54:23
Why do you think so?

Seeing the increasing volume on Chinese exchanges it seems to be catching on. I think most bitcoins are sold in China now.

Just shaking out the speculators. I have been holding trough all corrections because I believe in the currency and not speculation without even understanding the full implications of Bitcoin
