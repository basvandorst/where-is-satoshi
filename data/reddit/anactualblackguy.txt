Is there no iOS option, I need android, iOS, Mac, and Windows if possible because I use a lot of different stuff but would love to have one account for all the devices?

ok, that long thing? Thats what I use if I need money? Can someone send me some coin so I know this is correct because this still feels like it's BS. I'm just not used to it yet, sorry

This is how it looks now

Ok, hit me up when you do thewoundgod I'm still so confused and I don't want to miss whatever you do since I need to understand this better.

my paypal email, tee shirts I made..mailing..everything.
It's all really scary honestly, but I do a tech podcast so I understand bitcoin, I just dont know how to set it up

thanks you
you and just gave me the exact same answer so I'ma believe it's legit. 
Is there a way to put this on a webpage?! I wanna make it a donation option on my beg page
@_date: 2014-07-08 08:03:20
I asked

Holy shit you might be jesus to me. This is what I need but honestly, I've ignored bit coin because for a time I didn't understand it. 
I love reddit, but I'm a 26 year old black man that likes tits, tech and talking about shit in a relatable way. After about may-september parts of this site is unbearable. 
I'll be replying again to see if I did this right.
Basically I need to give every payment option available incase anyone from you, to my normal fans to a benefactor want to help me move forward.
@_date: 2014-07-08 07:55:08
It's a tech show. So my fans will get with it...its honestly for you guys because I'm about to ask everyone for help and I need the option if anyone wants to give a struggling podcaster $1
@_date: 2014-07-08 07:55:58
shiiiitttttt. Thats exactly what I need to hear cause I'm going to bear my soul to reddit soon, so I know I need this option available just in case
@_date: 2014-07-08 08:00:56
Do I NEED that though? I'm not scared of privacy, I just want the payment option for anyone that loves the service. I need to funnel all donations to my real bank account because if I don't get 1200 bucks AT LEAST by friday I could lose everything I worked for.
I know some people don't like using paypal or want to stay fully anon, so I'm using bit coin, but overall, I need this to pay for my wife's trips to find a new job

Read some of the faq, saw the beginners sub. I'm going there but also if anyone here can help, please do. 
I basically gotta do a fucking testimonial and beg for money and I want to make it easy for detonators since they're my whole lifeline right now.
