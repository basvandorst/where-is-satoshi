Only as an illusion. Then, they stopped even bothering with the illusion.

My target to buy more is 13.6k. Thank you for helping me get there.

Among other downward pressure this week, Christmas, I believe, is also a factor in what is happening. You have a bunch of people who have probably thrown some cash into bitcoin in the last month or two who are cashing out for Christmas money.
Don't you think some of these casual investors have been thinking, "Yay, I have doubled my money. Time to cash out for Christmas!"
Sounds stupid, I know, but anecdotally, I personally know a hand full of people who have done this.

I bought at 17.3K and dont give a fuck. HODL!

Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I’m so distressed right now I don’t know what to do. I didn’t mean to do that to my mom but I’m literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I’m going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is bitcoin dropping? This can’t be happening. I’m having a fucking breakdown. I don’t want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Satoshi to be president and fix this broken country. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn’t supposed to be like this, I thought we were headed to the moon???? This is so fucked.

Then you should know better than to freak out like this, bud.

You say this like circlejerking is a bad thing. It has been a very positive and formative experience for many people. Maybe find a different analogy.

If 5 million are lost, this significantly increases to value of Bitcoin.

Duuuuude. It was a joke. Did you think I really wanted a hand job too?
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:22:39
You can always buy a little. Nobody says you have to buy a full coin. Just get in for an amount you are ok with.
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:06:12
Hopefully, bitcoin will be worth so much that we will all be able to afford to create some type of machine that makes us immortal.

If you were to cash out to buy a house or something, I could see that. Otherwise, there is no point.

if you email me a bitcoin, i will give you an HJ

It't usually only volatile on Saturdays. Other than that, the price barely changes at all.

I am really sorry man. Tell your wife. The longer you hide it, the worse it will become. As a married guy who has fucked up majorly before in other ways, I can promise you that. 
Other than that, just build your investments back up. This might seem like the end of the world, but it does not have to be. Learn from this mistake. Figure out what you did wrong, and do the opposite next time. Many other people have done the same thing. It will be ok. 
God bless you. I will say a prayer for you and your family tonight.

Which is why I ended by saying "it is just my opinion." I also suggested to him a pretty conservative investment strategy. Calm down.
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:43:39
Invest what you can afford. Long term, it will go up.  Your plan to buy half Bitcoin and Eth seems reasonable. The market has taken a hit today. IMO, it could slide to 3,200 or rebound quickly to 4,600 or so. Either way, I think it will be well above 5,000 USD by the end of the year. Just my opinion.
Also, if you are really feeling unsure, maybe just half your original plan. So, buy like 0.25 BTC and a 2 ETH.

Golden Gate has operated as a casino since 1909 and is a Vegas icon.
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:09:49
Still, it is a highly visible and respected casino in downtown that makes 12 million in revenue per year. I think you will see larger strip casinos following their lead in the not too distant future. They just announced a casino expansion, doubling their size, btw.

This comment isn't getting the love it should be. You are exactly right.
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:49:07
agreed. You explained it better than me.
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:24:33
I like your post, except for the analogy you use at the end. I would compare the people intelligent enough to develop bitcoin to the people who were intelligent enough to vote FOR Brexit. IMO, most of the people Googling "What is the EU" were the people who voted to stay.

You can't time the bottom of a dip. If you believe in it, buy.
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:37:48
OP, Maybe this is God telling you to buy Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-18 06:02:33
Yeah I completely agree with this. Maybe we just disagree on one issue. Thank you for your thoughtful analysis. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 05:40:22
I bought at 2500 and at 2100 and again at 1900 and am loving every minute of it. HODL

Shitstorms can create volatility. Take advantage of it.
