I don't care about being right. I care about adoption of a good system and educating the masses (the ignorant as you said) will need to be addressed before that can happen. So Akon is only helping with talks such as this. Your berating them as ignorant is the only ignorance that matters as far as adoption is concerned.
As well, you should question everything until it can be proven. It's how you avoid bitconnects from happening.

We are all ignorant until we're not. That's the point of education.
Are you saying we shouldn't educate the uneducated? Save your knowledge sharing for only other people with knowledge? Sounds elitist to me.
