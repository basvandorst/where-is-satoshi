I have worked with this agent through a few transactions, he really is one of the top in his field. He is not refusing to list it with bitcoin as an accepted payment, he is simply recommending against it because he has had one case where ridicule on a home listing from a local real estate site really affected it's potential sale price and resulted in a lawsuit.

Many wealthy individuals choose real estate as a means of consistent and predictable cash flow. The returns are not highest, but they are generally inflation-proof and stable. People freak out when real estate rises or dips 20%-30% a year.
If you have a substantial amount of bitcoin, and you wanted to afford a certain quality of life, you would have to spend or sell portions of it. Instead, you could sell a chunk and convert into an asset like real estate to create a baseline standard of cash flow that serves as a reliable budget.

Is it safe to store the BIP38 encrypted keys in an online spreadsheet like Google Docs? BIP38 is very hard to break even with a password that has a few characters....so, is it almost impossible to break with 10+ characters and store it online where theoretically someone could see it (like a Google employee)?

There doesn't really need to be a consensus. Something will catch on organically. Start calling them uBTC or "Mikes" or anything you like, and if you are part of a community something will stick, and some developer or merchant will start to list things under a certain name and that's what it will become. It's entirely possible it will be called different things in different countries, but the standard will always be BTC to refer to it.
