Good fucking luck shutting down the entire internet.

Maybe it's because miners wouldn't generate as much income from off-chain transactions and less use cases.

Nah, it would be better if you just banned state-based currency. Lets kill more than the dollar.

when we become a world currency equities will still outperform the currency. the wealth transfer is from government + bankers + IMF + World Bank + Late Gold Hodlers &gt; US while making the world incredibly libertarian. Which is a better world for us all. It is True Freedom, the freedom our founding fathers fought for.

Bitcoin will cause the dollar and all other fiat currencies to collapse at the next block halving. (Bitcoin monetary inflation will become lower current Fiat)
@_date: 2017-02-22 08:34:53
Bitcoin is still in its infancy, the tech is very new. It's kinda like the Internet in its very early days. Just hope they fix it soon because  when the next stock market crash happens..

Our current system has debit and credit attached to the currency itself. There is interest due on every Fiat Currency in existence. When the currency collapses so to do the debtors and creditors attached to said currency.

Fractional Reserve Banking is not an enemy, it is possible to have such a thing happen with bitcoin. For example: You deposit bitcoin in bank; they loan your bitcoin at a free market rate; you gain interest and the bank makes a profit with debtor pays of loan.

If our goal is to replace other currencies as THE global currency, then yes, fees will have to come down or else Bitcoin will implode. High Transaction fees can kill bitcoin as they hurt mass adobtion.

@_date: 2017-03-27 06:03:53
Off-chain transactions are best done by trusted 3rd parties. Kind of like how exchanges (and would-be future bitcoin banks) would do transactions is a privately held database to then create loans done to bitcoin through. You don't need to add 3rd party access to bitcoin to get said solutions to scaling. Or, in other words, you don't need SegWit/Lightning Network or have in baked in at all to have layer 2 solutions.
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:24:55
Question I have for you, is the market (the sum total of all human economic action) or central planners a better way to run an economy? Also, if bitcoin continues is exponential growth in value, what is worth a coffee today in bitcoin could eventually be a car, a lambo, even a house.

@_date: 2017-03-27 06:11:31
I'm excited for the potential rally caused by the increase to blocksize (like say 8MB). Will miss the North Corea jokes on r/btc. But on a more serious tone, I view miners as competitors in a market and I ask what is more healthy competition, 1000s of private hand-made car manufacturers before industrial lines became a thing, or Competition in the auto market seen today? We have less # of competitors, but a more healthy market. Or going even more extreme, we only have 2 companies that make GPUs, but we have extremely healthy competition between AMD and Nvidia. People often have monopolyphobia and chase after "perfect" competition as that would entail an infinite amount of producers, but is that truly the best way to engage in competition?
@_date: 2017-03-14 23:33:44
They wouldn't be able to be as strong as they are without the government creating them or taxpayers paying off the debt.
@_date: 2017-03-27 05:59:03
really damn close as Unlimited + Classic is at 45% now. Plus when you include XThin you get massive on-chain scaling.

And you should want to design bitcoin for possible use as coffee money as that is the greatest challenge for Bitcoin. Bitcoin derives value from being cash that is also a store of value.
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:25:11
I'm more of a bitcoin fan because it's even better than gold at preventing fractional reserve. But honestly the choice of currency should be left to a free market void of a government forced currency. If you don't think that a currency that is finite and impossible to tax will drive out Government Fiat to its inevitable death, you are naive. And in the absence of taxation, you have AnCapism.

@_date: 2017-03-14 14:13:46
And monetary system
@_date: 2017-03-27 07:10:38
Banks could set up debit and credit cards demonized in bitcoin and use current networks to exspanded transaction supply. On-Chain Bitcoin is mostly there to prevent the artifical creation of money and banks credit and serve as cash transactions or a means to transport wealth between firms. We want as many use cases as possible for the protocol itself as in these early days the only transactions that make sense economically are on-chain transactions.

@_date: 2017-03-14 13:01:13
Due to the nature of debt-backed state-based Currencies with a monopoly on supply, the government will continue printing money indefinitely. One must measly wait for the crackling boom and then poof goes the dollar and hyperinflation/massive debt deflation we go. (This isn't going to end well)

Governments (or what you think of as their most necessary goods)(police, law, and courts) won't be impossible, but they would have to provide that good/service on the market and use voluntary trade. To read theory about how such a thing could work I would recommend doing some google searches on it.
@_date: 2017-04-30 12:21:02
Gold based assets, silver, and computer stocks. Stocks in companies that are lowering costs tend to be pretty good. Conspiracy talk about the FED is meaningless though, no one really cares.

The power of sound money
@_date: 2017-05-03 17:53:09
Bitcoin (if successful) will end the FED and replace government fiat with sound money, bringing about Crypto-Anarchy and AnCapistan. In other words, because Bitcoin has the potential to become very sound money, there will never be a top. But overall prices will simply fall as the dollar experiences inevitable hyper-inflation.
@_date: 2017-05-01 22:14:48
I'm moreso getting at the point that no group of central planners can centrally determine the blocksize because they lack the knowledge of the miners. In other words, giving miner more control and flexibility is good, not bad.
