But btc is fast and cheap when no one was using it as well. How do we know how well this will scale? This post isn’t very helpful without that info.

Arguably more dangerous to announce to a room full of strangers that you have 5 bitcoin than it is to just keep quiet and keep it on the exchange with proper 2FA.

I always found it funny when people say "Brooklyn, NY" as if we have to agree on which Brooklyn you're referring to. It's like saying "Paris, France" or "London, England". Welcome to the greatest city in the world.
In any case, the abundance of Bitcoin ATMs in the city is pretty awesome - it's almost as if no one cares about the BitLicense.

Sure, there's a Paris Texas and Brooklyn Connecticut, but in those cases you'd clarify. The remaining 99% can leave out the state/country.

so you conduct AML/KYC and are subject to regulatory examinations?

I wish btc would cut the foreplay already and drop below 6k. If we see 5k or lower we’ll start seeing some huge green candles.

My point is that Bittrex could print USDT and there would be no way of knowing that this coin is actually backed by real USD. So you could buy a ton of btc with made-up non-collateralized money and cause massive market manipulation. 
Right now usdt is only $2B but my question is more hypothetical and theoretical.

They should just come out with their shitcoin and shill it on Twitter already.

Someone post this to the Nano sub and ask them what the point of their coin is

Buy now using cash app (easiest). Plan to hold for the next decade. Take profits occasionally. Good luck.
@_date: 2019-06-09 02:15:12
Unpopular opinion: you sound so new that it’s probably safer to keep it on cash app until you understand the risks. Just make sure you have very strong passwords and beware of 2FA with cell phones, etc
Let’s be real, the chances of cash app being hacked are probably lower than you losing it because you backed up improperly.

This. Bitcoin is not like gold or fiat currency because the mere THREAT of a bank run can shut an operation down. The game theory/economics should prevent this from happening.

Is there AML/KYC? Or can they be completely anonymous? If so, might explain the premium.

What kind of transactions have this quality of jumbling up addresses that come from different wallets? In other words when would it be the case that a bunch of different wallets are sending funds to an account at the same time? 
@_date: 2018-12-13 02:08:34
Maybe, but maybe not. I’m certainly concerned about the money printing going on at central banks, but assuming this large experiment actually works out in the short to medium term, bitcoin will remain in the background. 
I am not expert but I think the Fed can continue playing these games for a long time. But who knows? All I know is that it would take a major catastrophic event to dethrone the USD. Which is possible in the medium to long term, less likely in the short term. 
But again, who knows?

Reminds me of the anecdote that there are trace amounts of cocaine on x number of USD bills (not sure how true that is)
@_date: 2018-12-13 02:03:41
I’m talking about regulated coins that have regular audits (GUSD, PAX, etc). Not tether. 
Those are certainly backed by actual USD - and if you don’t believe so, then you must believe that the NYDFS and other regulators are involved in a large, complex conspiracy. Quite a leap of faith.

You sound like a flat-earther who says “you personally haven’t seen the earth is round”. 
I don’t think you’re representative of the market. Most people take a lot of things on faith (I’m sure you do too, outside of bitcoin). 
@_date: 2018-12-03 01:09:25
Just so I'm clear, this is when a wallet takes a bunch of UTXOs and combines them into an output, right? Wouldn't they still be able to prove that the one tainted address still sent funds to Bob?
@_date: 2018-12-03 01:13:19
True, in theory. But Coinbase, or any other merchant, for instance, may be forced to freeze those funds the moment it's in their possession. There are always workarounds, but what if a user is unaware and wants to exchange or buy something with tainted funds (that she is unaware of)?
