Stop the fucking reposts! Just fucking stop it!
@_date: 2014-01-04 09:13:19
I love how you already know you are breaking the rules and write a disclaimer. 
Every day there are a dozen of people like you who think they don't have to stick to their rules because their story is different. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 01:13:49
Another one of these threads? Really?
@_date: 2014-01-05 01:48:25
Exactly. These people don't brute force. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 03:26:57
Guess what, you're not the first to post this. Yes i know, big surprise! Didn't see that one coming!
@_date: 2014-01-07 11:48:00
Don't let the door hit you on the way out. 
Nobody cares that you are leaving. Bye!
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:02:26
Ah, some do and some don't. Good thing he started this thread or else this question would've been a mystery forever. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 01:44:07
This hasn't been discussed before. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 04:36:00
Wrong subreddit. Reported. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 10:07:59
Haha are you drunk?
@_date: 2014-01-04 09:07:31
Fucking lowlife idiot. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:53:51
Mweeeeeh mweeeeeeeeeeh
@_date: 2014-01-12 08:17:34
Every day a dozen people post random news because they think they don't have to stick to the rules. 
Reported. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 17:31:23
How about you start a discussion in one of the existing threads instead of starting yet another one with no extra info whatsoever?
@_date: 2014-01-07 07:09:30
It's a troll. Nobody is THAT stupid. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 02:56:46
Jesus Christ! Just fucking stop it man! You are not the brightest, are you?
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:08:23
Please, stop it with these threads. Please, just stop!
@_date: 2014-01-12 17:39:26
Wrong subreddit you tool! 
Oooh wait, you're trying to create a Bitcoin circle jerk because companies dealing with Bitcoin can't be hacked of course. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 23:47:13
Ah you want to get rich automatically. Let us know how that works out for you. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:35:36
Would you also start a thread asking how you would get 5 dollars?
@_date: 2014-01-05 02:38:48
Seriously, what exactly do you expect people to do about this?
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:38:59
Don't answer him. Let him use the sidebar. It's there for a reason. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 08:33:49
Do you realize your username is spelled wrong?
@_date: 2014-01-06 01:36:31
Thanks for starting the 64th Bitcoin tax thread. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:12:40
For some reason i almost have 1k upvotes. Yeah i don't understand it either. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 05:57:28
Stop the fucking reposts you fucking retards! 
@_date: 2014-01-06 04:04:12
That's a pretty snarky response dude. I thought you didn't want those in your thread?
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:16:44
Yes we fucking know because it's already been posted!
@_date: 2014-01-17 08:42:15
Yes we know you fucking idiot. It's been posted 20 times already. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 04:37:09
Yes we fucking know. Look on the fucking mainpage!
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:04:49
Stop whining. After 50 threads with open discussions whining won't solve anything. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 10:03:17
Yeah, downvote me. That will teach me!
@_date: 2014-01-13 08:37:53
Let me guess. You didn't see it because you didn't search. Like the 150 other people here who repost shit all day long. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 08:47:42
That's why you keep replying. I love it!
@_date: 2014-01-12 01:39:10
Every day several people like you break the posting rules because they think their post is different. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 06:04:51
No shit? We didn't know this yet. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 02:25:13
People here love to post old news. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 03:25:42
Yes we know you goddamn fucking retarded fuck!
@_date: 2014-01-16 04:15:16
I'm shocked that annoying idiots like you who repost shit all fucking day long aren't banned more often. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 00:29:20
You shouldn't reward idiot behavior or they will keep doing it. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 02:01:17
This isn't gonna end pretty. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 12:42:25
2 people posted this week that a car is for sale for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 12:38:33
Worthless article. 
They quote him saying "it breaks these laws" and then don't tell us what laws. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 08:51:13
He hopes it goes viral and will make him a lot of money. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 02:02:31
It's been posted 2 times already. This is just some stupid kid looking to get some free Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 17:37:04
Yes we fucking know!
@_date: 2014-01-06 00:23:50
You really have no idea what it's about? Is it yours by any chance?
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:46:47
Use the fucking search you idiot!
@_date: 2014-01-11 01:42:33
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:02:37
Sir, this awesome news has already been posted. I personally share your excitement but please browse the page next time so we can avoid reposts which might be slightly annoying to some people. 
Thank you so much. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:42:53
No, you are 14. Can't be older. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 17:42:45
I'm a Bitcoin expert as well. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 15:39:28
These use the search instead of asking the same question for the 100th time. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 03:24:36
You're the first person to think of this. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 00:29:57
How's life being a fucking lowlife beggar? 
@_date: 2014-01-12 01:33:19
What about buying and selling don't you understand? How do you think it got to 897? 
@_date: 2014-01-03 02:10:43
Yup, you're gonna make 2 dollars! You pimp you!
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:24:46
Noooo he didn't!
@_date: 2014-01-16 13:48:35
Yes and every day a dozen people break the rules because they claim their post is relevant. Guess what i could find a 1000 non Bitcoin articles and break the rules by posting them here because i think they are relevant. Just fuck off or post Bitcoin articles here. Nobody gives a shit what you think is relevant. I want to read Bitcoin news here. Not other news. Even if you think it's relevant. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:12:56
Normal people search for title keywords. And believe me, it's already been posted. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 06:41:51
Do i need to explain again why your opinion means shit?
I can find 100 non Bitcoin articles and make them indirectly relevant...in my opinion. 
This place is for Bitcoin news. Period. So once again piss off and go post your opinions somewhere relevant. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 01:56:38
Zoomggg its not just a scam but a SCAM!!!1! 
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:31:23
It's already been more than enough with these posts but of course it will go on for another 3 days or so. This place is so retarded sometimes. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:23:27
Yeah, because the difficulty always stays the same. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 11:54:31
And you broke the rules. The rules of this subreddit don't care about your opinion. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:55:39
Blah blah blah. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 07:21:41
FYI it's already been posted. How can you possibly think you are the first to post this. Are you new here?
@_date: 2014-01-13 08:36:29
Stop spamming you idiot!
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:37:38
What happens if you use the search?
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:22:22
I'm not even gonna start explaining things. Can't be bothered. 
Just do yourself a favor and step away from the keyboard. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:16:06
Stop fucking reposting shit all fucking day long you fucking idiots!
@_date: 2014-01-07 12:09:55
Thanks man. It's only been posted 30 times today. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 00:57:38
I came here to say that. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 03:39:43
Me a loser? Funny, i just read a whine story how you scammed. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 08:01:06
Wth would you spend so much time on it?
@_date: 2014-01-16 02:16:28
Make sure you don't use the search. Instead annoy everyone here with a question that's been answered 80 times already. I mean why use the search right?
@_date: 2014-01-09 02:53:54
No, nobody. Obviously. 
Idiot. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 03:32:17
Haha right. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 03:42:03
Yes we know, you fucking moron! How fucking hard is it not to repost something? Are you fucking mentally handicapped or what?
@_date: 2014-01-16 02:09:03
What, you don't love those thought experiments?
@_date: 2014-01-10 03:13:07
That's a lot of crying. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 06:04:42
This hasn't been discussed before. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 03:24:44
USE.the.fucking.search!! FFS!
@_date: 2014-01-09 06:19:01
There are also already 5 other threads about it. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 08:15:38
Stop crying. Please. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 13:28:00
Another conspiracy? Yawn. Just ignore it. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 17:54:07
I retire. 
I can't handle it anymore. Goodbye. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 23:51:32
Use the fucking search man. It's all been explained 100's of times before. Everyone is tired of these threads. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 15:39:53
You're an idiot. Stop blaming Paypal. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 06:55:29
A car for sale is worth starting a thread about? Seriously?
@_date: 2014-01-04 00:10:07
Bit coins? 
@_date: 2014-01-03 03:40:37
And pretty much in the rest of the world you don't. And people are not gonna start doing it just to use Bitcoin. I know reality hurts. Keep downvoting till it goes away. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 02:59:29
Of course some annoying dumb ass kid like you has already done that. Wtf did you expect with 200 of these idiots posting here. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 02:12:34
I'm pretty sure an 8 year old retard could avoid reposts. How come you can't?
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:55:09
Please just stop. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 11:53:01
Actually yes it is your job to do that before posting. You dumb fuck. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 17:09:58
Yes we know because it's been posted 20 times already. Annoying idiot!
@_date: 2014-01-12 12:04:25
I love panic sellers! I love people fucking up and wonder why they just lost half their coins. I could read those cry stories for days. I hope a few get posted today actually. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 04:52:22
Mods, at what point does someone get banned exactly?
@_date: 2014-01-03 03:15:28
You are smoking some good stuff aren't you?
@_date: 2014-01-14 01:00:12
Yes we know you fucking idiot! 10 people before you posted it already!
@_date: 2014-01-17 13:59:15
No, i mean how stupid it is. A car, why is that worth posting. It was the same car even. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 02:07:10
No, it is because this place is filled with 16 year old idiots with 0.2 coins starting threads all day that say "spartans hold" and "to the moon". 
Whales avoid kiddie playgrounds like this. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 07:26:11
After probably seeing the word Bitcoin 100 times how exactly did you manage to write is as Bit Coin?
And please just fuck off with this question. Everyone is completely tired of it. 
I can't believe people still answer you 
@_date: 2014-01-14 02:52:21
@_date: 2014-01-17 12:36:27
@_date: 2014-01-08 05:06:46
Haha 0.1 BTC. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 04:57:25
Stop trolling. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 00:07:43
Paranoid much? Someone sent to the wrong address. And he hopes you send it back. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 07:32:10
Yes, we fucking know!
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:50:59
Yes we know you goddam fucking moron! It's been posted 20 times already! How fucking hard is it not to repost something? Are you mentally handicapped or what!
@_date: 2014-01-10 23:49:06
That he sent an email?
@_date: 2014-01-07 08:02:44
Probably the same shit that gets posted 5 times a day. I for one am not gonna read it. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:41:29
Yeah sure but there is nothing wrong with an "important" Bitcoin post hitting the front page every now and then. I just had no clue Reddit works like that. That they just block random stuff that a staff member doesn't like. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 01:42:01
Thanks man. Putting all my coins in this. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:48:37
How old are you? 15?
@_date: 2014-01-01 21:07:11
Yeah. Just annoying spam. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 06:28:03
Against Bitcoin? Nooooo, they just love it when you sell Bitcoin related items through their site. I'm totally clueless why they blocked you. Ebay against Bitcoin haha! Are you mad!
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:19:10
Give me one good reason to start the same post a dozen people before you did as well. The last one just minutes ago. 
The "new" page is FILLED with these posts. All from people who refuse to scan for reposts because they think they are the first to post this. Why the hell would you start yet another one other than needing attention?
@_date: 2014-01-11 05:06:04
Stop the fucking reposts! It's really not that hard!
@_date: 2014-01-17 01:33:10
Fucking retard!
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:01:33
So you expect someone here to have a list of the 1000's of companies accepting Bitcoin that says who does convert it and who doesn't? Or what kinda answer do you expect exactly?
@_date: 2014-01-11 03:30:09
He's mentally challenged and for some reason allowed access to the internet. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 07:23:58
You cry a lot. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 02:00:43
Calm down. This is a serious [serious] topic. Please don't troll in this topic. There are about 15 similar other topics you can troll in. This one is special. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 08:38:54
Yes we know you fucking idiot! Because it's been posted about 20 times 2 weeks ago!
@_date: 2014-01-15 03:34:28
Wrong subreddit. Reported. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 06:10:34
Of course you can. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 12:16:34
Educate yourself before posting useless threads.
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:51:19
Yes we know you fucking retard! It's been posted several times already. How fucking dumb do you people have to be to repost shit all fucking day long! It just goes on and on and on!
@_date: 2014-01-01 23:50:02
Yes, lie about it. Best thing you could do. That's why you always should ask advice from 16 year olds on Reddit. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 05:14:01
That you are annoying. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:54:36
Yes we know you fucking idiot! Because 20 people posted it already!
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:45:06
You are the first to think of this. Nobody has posted this before. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 17:48:28
Jesus fucking Christ! The next person who starts a thread about this should beshot in the knees! This place is completely retarded! Without the reposts we'd see 10 new posts a day here. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 06:33:26
I see i really upset you by pointing out your stupidity. Funny :)
@_date: 2014-01-05 01:37:00
I suggest using the fucking search, you prick. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:00:18
You are new to this internet thing, aren't you?
@_date: 2014-01-03 03:14:46
Nobody is gonna hand over their drivers license to buy some drinks you freak!
@_date: 2014-01-11 15:41:03
Yes we know as it has been posted several times yesterday. At what point exactly did you think you were the first to post this?
@_date: 2014-01-17 02:54:52
Nobody gives a shit what you think is relevant. You are really
Not that important. This place is for BITCOIN news and not what you think is relevant you arrogant fuck!
@_date: 2014-01-04 10:27:05
Nothing will happen. 
And i hope the next kid who starts a to the moon thread gets banned. Annoying idiots. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 08:41:40
Stop begging you loser! Get a fucking job! Do you beg on the corner of the street as well or just on the internet?
@_date: 2014-01-11 16:40:19
No shit. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 01:25:21
Here we go again...it will be posted every 15 mins the coming 2 days. Will you people ever learn?
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:10:45
This hasn't been discussed before. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 04:35:28
Piss off. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 12:40:50
Stop the fucking reposts ffs!
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:35:02
You have to be kidding me? Is this for real? Why the hell would they do that? Do they consider Bitcoin so goddamn evil that people aren't allowed to talk about it or what?
@_date: 2014-01-12 16:19:32
Flee to Singapore?
Grow up. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 05:38:06
Cool. Another worthless thought experiment. We've only seen 200 of those here. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 06:56:47
Why don't you look better next time so we can stop the 70 reposts here per day. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 08:38:05
Use the fucking search you tool! Annoying prick!
@_date: 2014-01-15 04:35:31
Yes we fucking know! Stop the goddamn fucking reposts! Jesus!
@_date: 2014-01-09 06:15:17
ZOOOMMMGGG look at me! FULL CAPS because my message is extra special important!!!1!
@_date: 2014-01-03 02:08:07
Aaah car seller 4s. Right. Everybody here is from China and knows what or who that is. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:36:46
You will lose your money. You won't believe me now and do it anyway. After you lost it you will feel very stupid. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 12:35:42
Why don't you indirectly piss off and post Bitcoin items here instead. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:21:41
You get downvoted because this is 2 days old news that has been posted 10 times already. You idiot!
@_date: 2014-01-15 15:20:16
Still didn't use the search i see. You are a fucking troll. Piss off!
@_date: 2014-01-15 05:40:38
I love how you already add a disclaimer because you know this news doesn't belong here. 
Every day a dozen people post non Bitcoin related news here because they all think it's different in their case. In the meantime everybody has to deal with this crap here while they simply want to read Bitcoin related news. 
So piss off and go post it somewhere relevant. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 14:12:18
Bwwaaah bwaaaah i'm so butt hurt bweeeeeh
@_date: 2014-01-17 08:42:31
Fucking retard!
@_date: 2014-01-15 05:41:40
Huh? So you add that it's relevant. Like it's a fact but you have no clue if it actually is relevant. Idiot. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 10:31:28
Jesus christ! You fucking idiot! Can't you see it's been posted every 30 minutes already? Retard!
@_date: 2014-01-06 13:35:02
Yes we know you fucking idiot! Jesus christ!
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:05:12
Use the fucking search you annoying prick! It's been answered well over a 100 times!
@_date: 2014-01-16 02:17:09
Your Bitcoin circle jerk failed. You dumb ass kid. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:30:20
Good. They are pure scum and i love to see somebody stopping them. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 12:34:40
Yes we know. Because it's been posted 10 times already. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 13:39:05
You still refuse to understand it. Wtf is wrong with you? You won't make any free money. Zero. Nothing. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 10:14:05
Stop fucking posting this every 30 minutes you fucking idiots! Just think before you post something! You are not the first to post this. Just keep repeating that till you get it!
@_date: 2014-01-15 15:17:48
Yes we fucking know! Because 5 people before you posted the same thing!
@_date: 2014-01-13 03:36:28
It's been posted 10 times already you fucking idiot. The first time half a week ago. 
Stop the fucking reposts! How fucking hard can it be!
@_date: 2014-01-05 08:28:28
Holy shit! Stop these fucking threads already! Stop answering these idiots! Let them learn how to use the search. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 04:53:58
Mweeeeeh i'm so butt hurt mwwwwwweeeeeeh
@_date: 2014-01-15 13:17:53
Use the goddamn search you fucking idiot!
@_date: 2014-01-07 11:46:54
This is getting ridiculous. Are you just trolling or what?
@_date: 2014-01-10 23:48:21
People are still in doubt if that complete fucking retarded troll might be real? Seriously?
@_date: 2014-01-07 04:41:22
Yes we fucking now! Because it's been posted about 30 times already. You people can stop now. We get it. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 03:22:36
Jesus christ! Fucking stop posting the same thing every 10 mins you fucking idiots!
@_date: 2014-01-11 09:21:08
Haha thanks. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 11:53:50
This would've been news 6 months ago. Not anymore. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 06:06:07
You are getting more pathetic by the day. Not sure how that's even possible. I don't think i've ever seen someone as butt hurt and desperate on the internet as you. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 04:39:12
Reported. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 02:43:07
You are one of those kids that starts "to the moon" threads, right?
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:46:32
A whale sells. All the small fish panic sell at the lowest point, the whale buys back cheap and all the small fish panic buy back in at the highest point and then wonder wtf just happened and why they lost half their coins. Over and over and over again because desperate people act like lemmings. 
Is this new to you?
@_date: 2014-01-15 17:50:01
Yes, we know you goddamn retard! It's already been posted. Like 90% of the posts on the "new" page! How goddamn fucking hard can it be to not repost shit all fucking day long!
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:37:52
Odd, that's not my goal. But if it makes you happy haha
@_date: 2014-01-08 05:03:30
Not this shit again. 
How old are you?
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:34:08
At the fucking link called "getting started" to your right. 
Are you blind?
@_date: 2014-01-12 05:02:06
Yes we know. It's been posted several times 2 days ago. How fucking hard cant it be to stop the goddamn reposts here!
Just do this before posting:
1: realize you're most likely not the first to post this. 
2: scan the current page. 
3: do a search on a keyword in your title. 
4: if nothing then post
Seriously, how fucking hard is this?
@_date: 2014-01-11 03:51:12
I seriously don't think he's even trolling. He has some kind of mental disorder. Even if he is trolling. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 17:41:53
Really? It's unbelievable? 
@_date: 2014-01-16 03:25:06
Stop fucking reposting you fucking idiot!
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:33:26
Just refuse to use the search and find 50 topics that explain this step by step. I mean why use it if you can start another thread about it right?
@_date: 2014-01-15 13:18:37
Please stop answering these people. There are 300 threads that can answer him if he wouldn't REFUSE to use the search. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 02:47:42
Nobody here is gonna get you you money back. Really, nobody. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 01:33:52
The person who made up the name Tippercoin should be shot in the knees. I also love how that shit gets spammed here every day like people give a shit. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 12:42:02
Great, now remove those caps as well. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:49:18
Yes we know you fucking retard!
@_date: 2014-01-07 06:27:46
Thanks for posting it the 30th time. Fucking annoying idiots!
@_date: 2014-01-01 07:22:20
What's it like to be 16? Are you enjoying it?
@_date: 2014-01-16 04:42:33
Is your keyboard broken or do you feel really important?
@_date: 2014-01-14 04:03:18
Another one of these threads? Really?
@_date: 2014-01-14 02:38:18
Nobody cares. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 02:04:57
News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.
I'm reporting your post. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 11:44:40
Yes we fucking know!!!
@_date: 2014-01-06 08:14:24
Yes. It's someone begging for money. It's pathetic. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 11:07:03
Every fucking post you make is either spam or a repost. Can't you just piss off?
@_date: 2014-01-07 01:13:09
Yes. The 20 people before you who posted this also got it. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 06:58:59
Stop trolling. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:40:19
Stop the fuckings reposts! How fucking hard can it be? I'm pretty sure a mentally challenged 8 year could do it so why not the people on this subreddit?
@_date: 2014-01-15 03:49:56
ON NOW!!!1! Zommggg!!!
Also bit coin?
The 1000's of people and articles writing it as bitcoin didn't give you a clue?
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:37:45
You are a goddamn annoying kid. But i'm sure you are aware of that. 
Also there are probably meds to deal with whatever mental condition you're suffering from. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:47:23
Stop these fucking posts already you fucking morons!
@_date: 2014-01-07 01:42:50
Are you fucking blind or what! 30 people posted it already! The last one minutes ago! Idiot!
@_date: 2014-01-01 20:50:26
That article has to be some kind of troll joke. Simply can't be real. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 02:32:57
Stop fucking spamming your shitty site!
@_date: 2014-01-06 00:30:40
So you start begging for a few dollars?
@_date: 2014-01-09 10:28:18
Not only a dumb ass troll but also a pathetic cry baby. What a surprise. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 03:38:34
No. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 12:18:56
How the market will react to an auction?
@_date: 2014-01-06 14:56:50
My god! Because 10 reposts in English wasn't enough. 
Wtf is wrong with people here?
@_date: 2014-01-06 00:28:03
And at no point you thought "God, what a fucking loser i am. I'm 18 and spending 3 weeks to make 5 bucks. I officialy have the worst paying job in the fucking world. I completely suck at life"? No?
At no point you figured getting a real job might be a better idea?
@_date: 2014-01-02 11:20:19
Really? So the 300 threads about mining that all say it's a waste of time are just opinions? And you figured you should start yet another thread about it because suddenly things may have changed?
Basically you just refuse to accept you won't make any free money. Am i right?
@_date: 2014-01-14 03:37:55
Wrong subreddit. Reported 
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:52:44
It it's in French it must be true. 
Funny how every day dozens of people here claim to know why Bitcoin will go to 0 or to 100k. Must be an amazing gift to have to be able to look into the future. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 07:32:51
Stop the goddamn reposts all fucking day long you morons!
@_date: 2014-01-07 06:35:45
When a site goes down don't check to see if someone else already posted it. No start your own thread because you are more important. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 09:09:05
And people who write like you will never have a career. Who the fuck is gonna hire you when you type like a 12 year old. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 02:41:32
Did you really think that an article from jan 1 wasn't posted here already?
If you've been here longer than a day you must've noticed the tons of reposts. How can you possibly post a 4 day old article and not think it's been posted before?
Congrats, you are now one of those annoying pricks. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 23:50:33
Again? For the 20th time?
@_date: 2014-01-07 08:05:16
Stop spamming you dumb fuck. Go learn how to market something because right now you achieve the opposite effect. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 07:16:27
Blaaaah blaaaah i want a free house and make it sound as a Bitcoin community experiment blaaaah blaah. 
Go work for your money you fucking loser. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 15:13:55
Is he going to investigate the Euro and Dollar next?
@_date: 2014-01-11 13:01:06
That's not how trolling 419 scammers works. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 08:13:36
Kids, this is the same troll as the Amazon and Ebay guy. 
I'm sure 2014 will be great but please don't feed the troll again. You only will look stupid again. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:59:28
Stop fucking posting the same story over and over and over again you goddamn fucking idiots! Wtf is wrong with you people!
@_date: 2014-01-15 13:19:12
Yes we fucking know because it's posted several times already!
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:16:02
Jeesh, how often do you drink?
@_date: 2014-01-09 12:24:00
What's just as worse is people starting these kind of threads every 10 minutes. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 01:45:18
This hasn't been discussed before. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 05:27:33
This hasn't been discussed 400 times already. Make sure you don't use the search and start a new thread about it instead 
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:35:54
Stop trolling. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 10:20:34
Another completely worthless thread with an impossible to answer question. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 12:34:05
Stop spamming. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 08:44:34
Why is it not possible to use the fucking search instead of asking the same question for the 200th time? Is it because you are an annoying little prick?
@_date: 2014-01-07 01:12:29
Yes we know you fucking retard!
@_date: 2014-01-08 01:55:06
Fuck, here we go again. Now this bullshit will get posted every 15 minutes for the next 24 hours. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 06:03:49
Yes we know. Stop posting it. We get it. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 13:57:51
ELI5: why do you people REFUSE to use the search and instead ask the same question over and over and over again? Annoying prick!
@_date: 2014-01-04 11:35:45
Ok i'm sure now. You are mentally challenged. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:03:42
@_date: 2014-01-10 12:33:34
Ok, bye. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 13:33:50
Bullshit! Stop lying. I could find 50 threads now about this topic within 5 seconds. 
This question is asked and answered every single say. For months already. 
Idiot. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 10:23:18
Wrong subforum. Reported. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 03:41:20
Do you even go out? What strange world do you live in?
@_date: 2014-01-03 01:25:39
Fucking idiot. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 03:09:35
Piss off. Sell your fucking computer and tv. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 23:26:56
These kind of posts always make me cringe so hard. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:36:37
Cool man. You know have your own thread about it like all the other cool kids. 
Just don't post in one of the existing 50 threads about it. You are too important for that. You deserve your own thread. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:21:33
The easiest way is to use the goddamn search so we won't have to see the same question ten times a day!
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:30:01
Just stop it already! Jesus Christ!
@_date: 2014-01-16 02:32:10
Idiot. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 03:15:49
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:37:38
Guess what? Nobody here can look into the future. Yes, i know, it's crazy. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:07:19
So you figured why not start the 15th post about it?
Idiot. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 01:36:18
All these people begging for coins is so fucking pathetic. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:59:25
Come on man, 30 threads is enough. Pick one to post in. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 02:01:54
Just don't use the search and don't read the sidebar. It might actually answer your question. That would be ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 08:16:06
There are 100's of threads with opinions why it will go up or down. There is a thing called a search. To your right. Learn how to use it so we can stop 10 of these threads every single day. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 02:14:14
I'm dead serious. I'm getting a loan as well. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:18:57
Isn't this like 10 days old news? Or is he explaining it again?
@_date: 2014-01-17 14:17:42
Fucking hell! Just fuck off already!
@_date: 2014-01-11 15:43:57
Thanks for reposting last weeks news. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 08:08:01
How did you possibly not find the answer as this has been asked and answered about 200 times already. And the links in the sidebar also give you the answer. 
You didn't search at all did you? You simply lied about it. Am i right?
@_date: 2014-01-04 05:45:59
Can you point out the trolling part of my post please? I fail to see it. 
Oh wait, you do something stupid, i point it out and that's why am i troll of course. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 16:31:03
Wow, nobody has ever thought about that!
@_date: 2014-01-17 03:54:41

Yawn. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 01:42:01
Stop it already you goddamn fucking idiots!
@_date: 2014-01-04 09:11:28
This hasn't been discussed before. Thanks for starting a thread about it. Really, we had no clue. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 07:29:19
Blah blah blah
Some people understand marketing and some fail hard. Guess which category you belong in. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 10:28:14
4th what?
@_date: 2014-01-12 12:02:30
You're such a pathetic butt hurt fucking kid. Unbelievable. You seem to get more frustrated by the day. It's sad really. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 14:16:17
Stop it. Please. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:48:06
Another Einstein started posting here. Awesome. You're at the perfect place.

This Dogecoin spam is getting really, really old. Not only that, it's also completely childish and retarded. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 14:43:14
Huh? This shit happens all the time. Is this your first day?
@_date: 2014-01-16 02:13:47
Correct it? What's there to correct? Just tell him he's a fucking imbecile. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 06:06:18
Because they make millions selling worthless devices. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 01:29:20
Ah, right. You want to see the same copy and paste on a different domain every 15 minutes.  
@_date: 2014-01-15 15:18:20
Mweeeeeeh mweeeeeeeeeeeeh
@_date: 2014-01-08 07:48:30
Yes. We know. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 02:01:56
Yes, the question is retarded and can't be answered. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 03:52:54
Yes, Bitcoin would lose 500 in value. You've got it all figured out. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 04:46:41
What is crashing you idiot?
@_date: 2014-01-15 13:16:54
Bitcoin, not bit coin. Are you slow?
@_date: 2014-01-06 00:41:30
Haha i just don't understand how someone thinks that's funny :)
@_date: 2014-01-08 02:37:29
And that somehow makes you happy? Millions of people are suffering because of this. 
But hey as long as your 0.3 coin gets worth some money right?
@_date: 2014-01-06 06:06:21
Amazing how they just present this as a fact.
Nobody knows if this is the case. Actually the price was already rising before that news. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 03:01:40
But obviously you like to see it that way. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 08:03:29
Edit: i now noticed the username. That explains the nonsense. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 00:11:38
My guess it's just spam. Why would anybody post this for any other reason?
@_date: 2014-01-11 13:53:02
Please not these posts again. Fuck me. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:11:15
No seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you people? Why do you idiots just refuse to use the search and ask the same fucking questions EVERY single day? Explain it to me. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:53:23
It sucks nobody warned you this would happen. Totally didn't see this coming. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 02:19:28
Stop the fucking reposts you retarded idiot!
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:57:57
It IS photoshop bullshit. But as always the kids here will refuse to believe it. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 08:43:34
You didn't see this was posted 20 times already? You thought you were the first to post this?
@_date: 2014-01-11 01:32:48
Yes, it's all over. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:52:20
Can you idiots please stop posting titles in caps ffs!
It looks like this place is taken over by 12 year olds instead of the usual 16 year olds. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 09:38:38
Stop fucking reposting shit all day long you idiots. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 14:14:38
People have been saying that since 100+. Don't you ever get tired of it? It's been around 900 for a long time now. If it's overvalued we would've noticed that weeks ago. It's not. Unless there is some really bad news it most likely will go up. As it has done since day 1. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:44:24
@_date: 2014-01-14 11:06:11
Not this shit again.

Stop the fucking reposts you fucking idiot!

Did you really think you are the first to post this? Like really?
@_date: 2014-01-12 01:57:27
3 weeks 2 days 7 hours and 5 seconds roughly. 
No seriously, why even bother asking these retarded questions?
@_date: 2014-01-08 01:19:45
I just can't imagine posts like this to be real. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 15:10:50
Yes we fucking know! You are not the first to post this! You really aren't. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 17:03:45
No nobody knows. Also not the 300 people who posted the same story because they REFUSED to use the search. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 11:17:23
Wrong subreddit. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 02:57:36
Are you retarded? Serious question. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 16:40:02
No shit. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 13:37:28
This guy just discovered Bitcoin and didn't know the same shit has been posted 100's if not 1000's of times in the last 5 years?
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:01:30
Got any more old news that has been posted already? Wtf is wrong with you people?
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:14:11
Please stop it with the reposts man. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:53:27
Damnit! I always mess that one up!
@_date: 2013-12-31 05:06:09
Let's talk about unicorns as well while we're at it. Hypothetical of course. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:25:38
Just stop with these posts already. It's so annoying and childish. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:27:56
Thanks for starting a new thread about it instead of posting in one of the existing 50 ones. I guess you are important like that. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:29:01
This hasn't been discussed before. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:03:52
Didn't know they read this Reddit. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:23:45

The amount of people here who think we can look into the future is absolutely scary. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:37:34
Did they block all sites related to other currencies as well?
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:36:13
No, it runs on rainbows and fairy dust.

@_date: 2013-12-02 14:05:30
Posted several times already. Stop it. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:55:41
Whatever you do make sure not to use the search and see 300 topics with the same issue. 
No, instead be an annoying prick and start yet another topic about it. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:49:04
Don't answer him. Let him use the search. It's been explained so many times already. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:16:58
What makes you think anybody here can look into the future. I'd really like to know. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:18:11

What makes you think anyone here can answer this and look into the future? You're not the brightest are you?
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:53:24
Posted 15 times already. Yesterday. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:02:05
Who the fuck cares. It's some kid trolling other kids. Go post it in the troll box. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:35:23
Thanks. We didn't notice. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:01:07
Looks legit. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:09:50
You really think this wasn't posted already? Really?
@_date: 2013-12-30 13:52:35
You really think this hasn't been posted yet? Come on. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:04:46
That's what you get for panic selling. I can't feel sorry for anyone doing that. Actually i kinda like to see it. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:00:24
Only 10%
That's funny. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:36:37
I feel way more comfortable with today's growth than i did last week.
@_date: 2013-12-02 09:31:10
This hasn't been discussed 200 times before. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:51:42
We know. Please just stop. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:26:06
I see these posts a lot in threads about him. 
People simply are defending him because they are druggies or Bitcoin users. 
If this would've been some random rapist nobody would say what you just said or donate. 
Fucking hypocrites. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 13:58:20
Get a fucking job you loser!
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:23:13
Yes we know. It's a top story on the mainpage.
@_date: 2013-12-12 12:00:54
80 of these threads a month. Please just stop. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:31:43
100's of people predicted everything from july to december 2025. You found one person who was right by pure luck and start a post about? Really?
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:42:05
Cool man. You now have your own China thread. I mean why post in one of the 40 existing ones when you can start a new one.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:01:32
[serious] Use the fucking search you annoying idiot!
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:51:52
Use the search. Explained at least 50 times already. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:38:27
Stop begging. It's disgusting. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:55:54
Is that a fact? Or just something you just pulled out of your ass?
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:40:01
Huh? Where did he buy this?
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:39:06
Wtf is the marketplace?
@_date: 2013-12-29 08:44:34
How fucking hard can it be to not repost something for the 20th time?
What makes you possibly think you are the first to post this?
@_date: 2013-12-31 04:30:10
Oh stop it already. There are a zillion of these threads already. 
And there is no such thing as free energy. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 07:26:13
Worthless. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:08:08
Yes we know you stupid fuck!
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:11:33
What makes you think this wasn't posted already?
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:45:12
These posts have to stop.
@_date: 2013-11-24 08:48:37
Weekend. And bears trying to manipulate. 
Monday it should go up again. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:48:29
What's a moran? You mean moron perhaps? The irony is thick in this one. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:18:48
Repost and spam. Reported. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:59:33
The stage of the next person to post that picture should be shot!
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:11:04
You sold at 200 didn't you?
@_date: 2013-12-28 21:42:12
If you type "mining" in the search what advise can you read in basically every single thread about mining? Go try it. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:09:09
Because it's posted 10 times already and everyone is getting tired of all the idiots reposting shit all day long. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 15:36:15
Awesome man. You got it all figured out!
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:17:12
Robbie Williams? Wrong subforum dude. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:32:21
You just found out?
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:27:03
All those caps must mean he is dead serious. Better listen to this guy. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 17:24:28
Yeah, you got me. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:29:05
Yup, and having someone beat up and posting about it in public will make things better. I bet your kid will be real happy their father is in jail. I bet you are a real responsible parent. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:22:34
What kind of question is that? Worth coming back how? You want someone to say yes and you will buy coins or say no and you won't buy any?
Or is this one of those will Bitcoin make me rich posts? Where you think people here can look into the future?
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:31:20
Stop these posts you fucking idiot!
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:50:23
That guy is butt hurt pretty bad. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:04:55
Yeah don't ask or you will be downvoted. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 08:06:32
Nobody can look into the future! Nobody!
Stop these fucking posts already!
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:37:22
Yeah, that comment is such a reason to downvote. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:40:13
I'm gonna say it's a troll. 
Someone with 100 coins knows how it works and won't ask how to get your money back. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:39:26
Yes we know. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:37:32
Yes we are. Goodbye!
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:24:16
No. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:02:04
Nobody here can look into the future you fucking idiot!
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:48:14
Why the hell do you think people here can look into the future?
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:37:59
Yes, we found out the first 15 times it was posted. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:47:07
Did you seriously think you are the first to post this? Come on, really?
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:04:35
There are dozens of threads about this already. Use the damn search!
@_date: 2013-11-24 12:47:44
Horrible article.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:59:19
The people following those coins are illegal drugs buyers. What the hell do you expect them to do? There is nothing they can do in a legal way. They're idiots and i couldn't care less about their crying. And i highly doubt any of the exchanges will care about a bunch of criminals complaining where their drugs money is going. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:47:31
I take it you just sold your house and everything to put it all in Bitcoin. Or is your fact not really a fact but more of a guess?
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:11:11
You are the first to think about this. No, really. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:45:41
Yes we know you fucking idiot! 5 people before you posted the same thing. Are you blind?
@_date: 2013-12-02 10:28:16
Awesome story man. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 12:56:02
These posts are worthless. Every single day at least one person starts a thread why Bitcoin is a bubble or why it is not a bubble. And then follow all the usual pro or against arguments. We've seen it 100's of times before. There is only 1 fact and that is that nobody knows where Bitcoin will be a year from now. 
And you could've written even more but that wouldn't change that fact. 
I'm tired of seeing people like you acting like they got it all figured out. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:04:12
Here's your guide: use the fucking search! There are about 397 topics explaining to you that mining won't make you shit! Why do you people simply refuse to use the search?
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:47:52
Nobody can look into the future. Yeah i know, it's crazy!
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:31:09
Use the goddamn search you tool! It's there for people like you so you don't ask the same question that has been asked 300 times before!
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:06:41
Losing, not loosing. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:44:15
Why thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:36:59
Please stop answering these people. It's been answered at least 50 times already. Let them learn how to use the search. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:04:38
Can't you see it's posted several times already? How can you possibly think you are the first to post this?
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:31:33
Nobody is gonna give you free money you idiot! Get a fucking job instead of begging on the internet!
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:18:15
All this over 200 coins? I was sure somehere in the story i would read about a few 1000 coins lost. 
I lost a few 100 because of some bad decisions. It sucks and i moved on. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:23:34
Why do people here always think the rules don't apply to them?
"News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news."
Not only that, it's also a repost!
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:04:10
Nice spam
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:45:03
Piss off with these posts please. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 05:31:46
You basically want free money right?
I want 100 dollars a day. Any tips?
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:34:51
Thanks. We didn't know. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:52:32
How about you get a job and buy them?
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:49:08
You cry a lot. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:15:01
At the sidebar. At the link that says "getting started". 
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:29:38
So, no proof?
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:47:13
Yes we know you fucking retard! Because it's posted every 10 minutes!
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:29:19
What's the point in asking this? Just make something up yourself. Nobody here knows more than you do. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:01:58
One is pro bitcoin the other against it. Not that hard to keep track really. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:27:34
"Talk around the internet" haha. 
How old are you?
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:29:27
Yes we know you fucking idiot! It's been posted about 50 times already!
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:15:38
You 2 could probably get the same help and medication. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 10:59:58
If I have any more questions, I'll post another some time later if I still need to know something.
Uhm how about you start reading the faq and using the search instead you annoying prick. It's all been answered 100's of times before. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:25:55
Yes we know. Because it's been posted all fucking day long. Are you blind or just really fucking slow?
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:18:49
Do you even understand what Bitcoin is?
And i hope these 30 posts a day how someone just bought a coin will stop soon. It's getting annoying fast. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:05:23
Please stop with these memes and slogans etc. We've seen it 100's of times before. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 10:37:00
Yes, must be for Bitcoin support. What else could it be for right. 
What's the weather like in fantasy land?
@_date: 2013-11-24 08:31:01
Yes. This obviously has been going on since Bitcoin started getting big. 
The whales can only do this because people keep panic selling and buying and losing money in the process. The whale obviously is the one making money. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:18:52
So we should just post random wiki stuff all day long?
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:33:57
Stop the fucking spam already. It's been posted enough now. This is a Bitcoin subreddit!
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:54:16
Don't be so realistic please. This thread is supposed to start a circle jerk. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:41:25
This all has been answered dozens of times before. Which you would see if you didn't refuse to use the search. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:46:51
Please man. After 50+ similar posts we get it. The last one was just hours ago. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 09:12:47
Yes we know!
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:06:19
No. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:05:54
Yes. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:34:18
How the fuck can you expect anyone here to answer that?
Seriously, these questions i read here every day. I really sometimes wonder if this place is full of mentally retarded people.
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:54:34
Piss off with your spam. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:15:15
This hasn't been discussed before. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:38:34
Jesus man, stop the bs. Your questions have been asked and answered 200 times or more already. 10 people a day ask exactly the same thing!
If you people simply would use the search this would stop. But for some strange reason you refuse to. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:31:29
Piss off. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:23:41
Really? We didn't notice. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 07:49:43
Scary. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:14:00
Yeah because Bitcoin cares about that. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:03:10
Thanks for starting the 50th topic about this. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:35:11
What makes you possibly think this hasnt been posted many times already!
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:35:51
The 300 posts from people who got screwed over like that didn't give you a clue?
And please no, don't make another post about it. Everybody is sick and tired of reading the same thing 20 times a day. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:18:53
You just sold all your coins then i take it?
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:14:45
Don't bother. You will spend more on electricity than you will earn. Something that has been explained in about 200 threads already. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:58:38
I wonder from the 30 kids a day who post how they are picking up all these "cheap" coins how many actually bought something. And if they did how much exactly. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:08:31
I just love all these idiot panic sellers. It's so much fun to watch all these idiots sell their coins at the bottom and panic buy back when the price goes up. They lost half their money and you know what? They will do the same thing again and again. It's hilarious!
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:11:58
Yes you have. He clearly was a bitcoin supporter and bitcoin owner. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:05:57
Look to your right. There is this thing called a search. Guess why it's there. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:14:22
Yes we know. It's already been posted. Of course. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:47:03
No he's not you idiot. You have to be slightly retarded to think they are the same person. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:27:33
If only you kids would stop with that shit. Maybe more people would take Bitcoin seriously. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:07:50
ZOOOMGGG YOU ARE RIGHT!!!!1! Must be a scam!
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:42:27
Bullshit. Stop lying. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:30:14
Please go read one of the 200 similar threads instead of starting yet another one. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:38:31
You have to be kidding me?
Haha. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:26:29
And that's what i'm afraid of.This could turn out quite bad. Imagine them saying we sold 2000 dollars in parts after 2 months and now will remove it again. It will be really bad for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:44:00
Yes, you got it all figured out. A line that goes up so it must be the same thing. 
How old are you?
@_date: 2013-12-28 13:33:37
So you find your news here, copy it and post it here again. Well done you idiot. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 09:26:28
Gandhi never said that "first they ignore you" bullshit that has been repeated here about 300 times in the last 6 months.
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:26:29
So because you are an idiot and sold at the wrong moment you want the whole market to crash so you can buy back in?
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:19:43
What am i looking at. I hate it that i have to figure out what a post means because the OP is too lazy to post a few lines explaining things. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:13:09
Why are you asking this here? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:11:55
But seriously, please explain to me why Bitcoin is better now it lost half its value. I can't wait for your explanation. Oh and of course why it's better that more USD are traded now. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:24:06
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:50:05
Yes i have advice. Use the fucking search!
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:51:16
The next person who posts this should be shot. 
I'm so tired of reading the same shit 100 times. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:35:57
100 of these threads wasn't enough of course. Good thing you started yet another one. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:41:52
Nope, i'm SgtFuckface. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:37:40
Ah you're gonna spends days on surveys and other crap to make 30 cent in Bitcoin. Sounds like a better plan than getting a job! Well done!
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:17:45
You really think this wasn't posted 10 times already?
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:39:54
Pretty sure he's joking. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:12:05
So you want someone to tell you if we are in a bubble or not. Because random people on Reddit would know. Besides looking into the future how do you expect anyone to know this?
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:17:28
Also amazing to see how many people have no problem begging for money on the internet.
These aren't people who live on the street and have no food tonight.
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:36:39
That annoying idiot from the troll box? Who cares? I can't believe it's worthy starting a thread about it. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:35:59
Grow up. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 09:30:57
Jesus Christ!
Yes we know! Are you fucking blind?
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:55:18
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:04:13
Wtf are you talking about?
People using Bitcoin in China are not "bitcoiners" or something?
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:56:43
Please just stop. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 15:42:36
Create a real life Bitcoin circle jerk!
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:02:28
Nice troll. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:42:56
Thanks for starting this topic. We don't have charts on our computers so we had no idea. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:54:54
Fucking hell! Did you seriously think this wasn't posted 10 times already! Stop these fucking reposts!
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:56:13
You believe that? Or are you sure? The topic title makes it look like a fact. It would be very impressive if you are the first person on earth who can guarantee what Bitcoin will do. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 09:17:08
What is there to downvote really? There is no way their coins will ever be nearly enough to pay off their debt. Do you people who downvote me have any idea how much the debt is? And how it gets bigger by like 2 billion a day. Get real instead of living in fantasy land and downvoting everyone who tells you something you don't want to hear!
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:43:07
What kind of answer do you expect? 
Maybe? Possibly?
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:31:25
Please man. We get it after 15 posts. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 11:56:18
You are new to this whole Bitcoin thing, right?
@_date: 2013-11-24 07:30:22
Why would anybody downvote this? Wtf? Should i lie instead and tell him it will make him rich? Will that be upvoted then?
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:38:40
And another worthless post. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:11:28
You just want free money right? You are really young aren't you?
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:11:38
Just leave already. Bye!
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:56:48
Have fun with Bitcoins? What's that supposed to mean?
Anyway if i'm wrong then what are you asking from us exactly?
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:50:27
Yes we know. Because it has been posted 10 times a day for the last 3 days. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:43:32
And of course you are totally not related to this bullshit?
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:12:28
Please stop these threads. Please!
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:18:03
Really? I never read this before. Thanks for starting a thread about it. I had no idea. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:07:25
What a shitty life you must have if other people getting money annoys you. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:49:04
You don't even know what Bitcoin is, do you?
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:32:07
Yup, of course downvoted. Some people here...
@_date: 2013-11-24 07:27:50
Apart from the 30 posts a day about it of course. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:01:55
It's been posted 200 times before. It's useless, doesn't apply to Bitcoin and people randomly put 'where we are now" on it because they are clueless. I think i've seen up to 5 different we are here posts in a day. It's just retarded. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:43:38
300 people before you posted the same thing. You are an idiot if you still use them. How many more warnings do you need?
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:49:59
Ah, so you are related to it while pretending to be a random messenger. Guess i don't need to explain how this is bullshit. You just did it yourself. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:54:32
Yes we know. Because it's been posted 15 fucking times today! How can you possibly think you are the first to post this!
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:44:24
Jesus christ! Stop fucking using them already!
Do you see me crying about them all day long? No. Because i avoid them. How hard can it be. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:37:22
Thanks for posting this. We had no idea!
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:29:59
A big discount on a ps4. Really? I don't like to see people being scammed but this has scam written all over it. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:41:21
Try another thread?
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:01:24
Come on man. There are 100's of these threads already. Use the search and you have enough to read for the next few hours. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:20:12
Discussed at least 50 times before! Use the search! It's there for a reason. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:27:38
Yeah we got it the first 10 times you idiot!
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:06:54
Yes we know. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:07:45
No, it really is a fucking stupid question. Now and 5 years from now. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:24:58
What makes you possibly think that anybody on this planet can tell you if the price will go down or not? Don't you have at least some common sense? Can't you figure that out yourself?
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:09:48
How is Bitcoin dying?
@_date: 2013-12-22 07:01:35
Blah blah blah. 
So you are 100% right in predicting it but you don't buy and sell. Right. I think we know enough kiddo. 
You're trolling here every day how Bitcoin will go down. It's clear you're just a butt hurt kid who missed the train. Stop pretending it's anything else. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:01:55
So forget CoInvalidation, as of today we have an effective blacklist.
Let me fix that for you:
So forget CoInvalidation, as of today we have a bunch of druggies with a blacklist they can't do shit with. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:14:27
Come on! This is getting stupid!
Is it your first day here or what?
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:31:32
A criminal scamming people who buy illegal stuff. I doubt many people care. I certainly don't. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:23:54
Idiots panicing as usual. What else?
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:05:45
Discussed dozens of times before. Which you could've seen if you used the search. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:45:06
I think it's completely retarded spend hours making 10 cents instead of getting a job. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:28:06
Stop the reposts you idiots!
@_date: 2013-12-22 07:33:07
Blah blah blah
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:05:11
Yes we know. It's been posted 20 times in the last 2 days. 
Why is this 1 month old news suddenly posted like this?
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:15:21
Wow, i had no idea. Even though it's been posted 300 times before.
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:19:51
Bullshit! Stop fucking lying! Every single thread about mining tells you exactly the same thing you've been told in this thread. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:10:48
Great come back kiddo. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:35:08
Jesus Christ! Use the search! Why you think it's there!
@_date: 2013-12-31 04:32:47
Yes of course. What else could it possibly be. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:28:44
Idiot. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:50:18
ZOOOMMGG!!1! CAPSLOCK!! 
@_date: 2013-11-24 08:53:57
How many more times is this gonna be posted?
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:57:18
Stop acting like you know what Bitcoin will do you tool. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:27:06
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:58:41
You're gonna lose your money. I guarantee you that. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:37:56
No, because you are an annoying idiot. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:13:29
Look to your right!
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:01:36
At the sidebar. There is a link called getting started. 
These posts....please just stop. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:21:36
Please mods do something about these posts. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:07:09
Thanks for starting the 50th thread about it. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:26:29
You really think this wasn't posted already?
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:32:56
Ah...Bitcoin fantasy land. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:43:21
Here's all you need to know: stay away from it. 
A simple search would've shown you 300 topics saying the same thing but for some reason people refuse to use the search and instead prefer to ask the same thing 20 times a day. Just like you just did. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:10:39
Piss of loser. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:21:46
All caps. It's clear your post is more important than others. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:05:52
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:12:38
Just call them and they will return your 100k. I'm sure. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:08:33
Why do we need 20 of these threads a day? Especially since these these opinions are worth as much as flipping a coin. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 10:43:44
Stop spamming you dumb fuck!
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:13:53
You got it all figured out. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 07:26:28
Do i need to explain again how there are 300 threads saying it's a waste of time? What part of you're not gonna get free money don't you understand?
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:22:49
Yes? Is that a fact?
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:30:14
I'm getting kinda tired of these posts. About 20 times a day we have to read how bitcoin will or will not fail. 
Nobody can predict Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 10:02:15
These opinions you will get are absolutely fucking worthless. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:27:46
I think everyone is tired of these threads. Especially since it's impossible to predict what will happen. What's the point in asking these opinions 10 times a day. Every single day.
One person will say to the moon, the other will say we're gonna crash. It's like that in every opinion thread. Just stop making them. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:36:46
Yeah well, 20 people a day start the same topic. Every single day and it's annoying as fuck. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:22:24
This hasn't been discussed before. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:17:29
It will crash the interwebs. 
No seriously, if this would be possible don't you think it already would've happened? I don't understand these kind of questions. You can answer it yourself. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:47:40
Use the fucking search you annoying prick! It's all been answered at least 100 times already!
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:45:37
Stop these fucking posts you annoying idiots!
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:09:55
Just don't use them. You'll end up crying about them here and i think everyone has seen enough of these threads. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:51:41
Jesus Christ! Stop these fucking posts you idiots!
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:12:31
You really think you are the first person to come up with this? You can't be serious?
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:44:59
Please stop the reposts. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:42:30
How have they embraced it?
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:55:38
Yes we know you fucking idiot! There are 50 posts about it!
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:53:01
You people are so gullible. 
But whatever, bring on the downvotes. Just make it go away like it never happened. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:52:39
In real life do you ask strangers for free money as well? Or just on the internet?
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:42:57
Panic sell. Like everybody else does. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:30:17
Useless. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:48:45
How many articles with that title have been written in the last 6 months?
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:08:03
Finally? Clueless people having been doing that since day 1. What planet do you live on?
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:49:37
Come on man. It's been posted so many times already. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:07:31
Got any more old news that has been posted 50 times already?
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:24:20
Take a guess. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:22:10
Thanks for starting the 50th thread about this. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 09:50:37
Useless. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:49:53
Relatively more bitcoins get stolen. Also you have no insurance whatsoever. So at this point bitcoin is less secure. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:26:18
Absolutely worthless without extra info. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 13:40:21
Yes we know. It's been posted about 20 times already. Just make sure you don't use the search and instead repost over and over again. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:51:44
You're so cool for starting this thread. It's highly original. And so funny. 
It's not something twenty 15 year olds would do everytime we see a crash. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:33:36
You're new to this Bitcoin thing aren't you?
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:17:27
Only a retard would've believed that troll. Aparently there are tons of retards here. 
The sad part is the next time that kid trolls you you will believe him again. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:25:45
From the sidebar on your right. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:15:25
Jesus man. Come on!
@_date: 2013-12-31 04:43:19
That's a bit far fetched. But who knows. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 13:21:51
I wish they would stop mentioning cp in Bitcoin articles. 
Especially if it's not true (silk road didn't sell cp). 
Every person who reads that article now associates Bitcoin with cp. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:46:48
Poor kiddo. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:24:49
Great post man. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:18:41
Last week was pure hype. Bitcoin exploded. Now people are calming down. Normal market behavior.
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:28:35
Maybe it has something to do with the way you "asked" your question. You really didn't think of that?
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:51:17
ZOOOOMGGGG!!1! all caps! Look at me i'm so important!!!1
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:02:46
Oh another Bitcoin not allowed in China is actually a good thing post. 
Give me a fucking break you idiot. It's the worst thing that could happen at the moment as every sane person could see. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:15:45
Wow. Such deep thoughts. Nobody has thought about this before! Thanks for starting a thread about it?
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:30:46
Jesus Christ! Stop posting it already!
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:42:47
Being 14 is no excuse for being stupid and thinking people can look into the future. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:57:53
ZOMG CAPS!!! Look at me i'm so important!!!1!
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:10:52
You will fail. Believe me. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:21:04
Here's my thoughts: this is asked 20 times a day and the next person who asks this again should be punched in the face!
What fucking planet do you people come from that you think we can predict the future??
Really, how is it fucking possible that so many people don't realize this?
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:13:00
Please just stop. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:26:11
People should be banned for these kinda posts. 
I wish you kids would start your own subreddit. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 23:55:05
Is your capslock button broken or are you just extremely important?
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:53:09
We've only seen the same post about 300 times. Let's just stop making them ok?
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:34:41
You really think you are the first to post this? Really?
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:30:24
It's this simple. We need another subreddit for these kids where they can post that stuff all day long. And here it shouldn't be allowed. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:48:50
Thanks for starting the 10th thread about it. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:48:58
Stop answered these people. Please.
If you stop answering then they will figure out how to use the search and these threads can stop.
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:48:29
Stop these fucking posts already you annoying idiots!
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:59:46
It doesn't work like that. How about you start reading the wiki/faq?
@_date: 2013-12-22 06:42:13
Stop trolling. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:53:14
Wow, awesome thread. This hasn't been discussed before. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:38:24
His optimism = a 15 year old kid with half a coin who thought he would be rich by next month. Now the price is crashing he thinks he can start a panic buy by making the dumbest troll post of the day. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:29:45
Uptight you mean?
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:36:45
Oh look another what is your opinion the price will do thread. You are right. 10 a day is not enough, let's start some more. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:12:00
You're wrong. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:30:49
Cry me a river. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:52:40
He tried to have 6 people killed. I don't care about your drugs utopia etc. 
I just don't really like murderers. Yeah i know. Totally weird. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:42:44
Use the search and the faq. It's all been explained a 100 times. If you couldn't even figure that out things don't look well for your project. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:45:16
You won't. 
A simple search would've told you that. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:33:38
Idiot. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:14:15
A caps warrior. Everybody just loves it when people post in all caps. We all know that person is really important. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:42:57
You probably see the word Bitcoin written 300 times a day. At what point exactly you figured you should spell it as Bit-Coins. How does that work in your brain?
Oh and stop making up stories. You suck at it. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:49:36
You know i'm always right! 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:59:26
Thanks we didn't notice. We don't have charts and this page hasn't 30 posts about it already. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:28:11
Yes. These people will never learn. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:11:48
What makes you possibly think this hasn't been posted already. Many times. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:11:00
Yup, Bitcoin scammed you. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:49:31
It was kinda funny the first time it got posted. 
Please just stop. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:29:17
0.00022 too much.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:52:54
Oh and piss off with your begging. 10 dumbass kids like you post these stories how they need a donation. It's all bullshit to get a few free pennies. It's pathetic. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:11:42
Come on man! Can't you fucking see half the threads here are reposts? What makes you possibly think your "news" hasn't been posted already? Are you special?
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:18:56
Discussed in 100's of threads. Use the damn search!
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:15:59
This is probably a 16 year old kid with 0.3 bitcoin and in denial. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 13:45:08
Right here. OP, you're an idiot!
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:27:36
I think you can block him but you need to download a browser plugin or something. Let me know if you find anything so i can block him as well. 
We don't need trolls like him here. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 09:47:43
2fa is useless. Coins get stolen with or without it. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 09:20:25
Because they are worthless?
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:31:34
Right, you got it all figured out. I love how you present this as a fact n
@_date: 2013-12-12 11:29:21
Jesus christ man. It's been posted 30 times already. A week ago. 
Idiot. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:09:30
Thanks. It's only posted 50 times a day. Good thing you started a thread about it. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:29:57
Come on! Stop it already!
@_date: 2013-12-02 09:14:47
You really have to ask this?
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:50:23
You really think this hasn't been posted 10 times already? You can't be serious?
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:18:31
Guess what? Nobody can look into the future. Yes, it's crazy, i know.
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:29:25
Unreadable. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:30:24
You must have noticed the 50 reposts a day here. So i wonder why you do the same thing then. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:45:06
I can't wait for the day someone gets punched in the face for doing this and then comes crying about it here. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:24:47
Yes we are aware of that you idiot! 2 days ago already. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:12:08
Look to your right! What is wrong with you people!
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:13:23
Stop these retarded threads man. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:53:34
Already posted. Of course. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:34:21
2 bullshit tweets. Not saying they won't but those tweets are worthless. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:59:24
STOP THESE FUCKING POSTS!!!
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:15:46
Really? We didn't notice. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 07:30:56
You are 15 i assume?
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:09:20
Yes indeed. These kids are so annoying. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:40:51
31 oct. Seriously? Because the tons of 2 days old reposts aren't enough already?
@_date: 2013-12-22 10:02:56
They moved them long time ago already to their own wallets.
This has been posted about 70 times here. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 13:41:59
Yes we know you idiot! Because just like 90% of your other posts this has already been posted!
Seriously, why the fuck are you even here? All you do is repost old news all every day. Just go away. Nobody will miss you. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:23:04
That's a lot of "facts". Can you back them all up please?
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:38:06
Yes we know. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:06:33
Yes we know. There are 50 posts about it. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:34:58
Jesus christ! Stop posting it already you fucking idiots! How fucking hard is it to not repost something!
How the hell can you possibly think you are the first to post this!
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:51:08
Using the search is way quicker than starting a thread and waiting for answers you fucking tool!
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:49:10
Yeah he looks like someone without many friends indeed.
@_date: 2013-12-20 08:56:50
So something that has been going up for 4 years is less safe than spending money in a casino. Am i reading that right?
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:18:47
Oh great. Now we're gonna get Bitstamp, Gox AND the average price updates every time Bitcoin moves a few dollars. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:51:21
We've had 50 of these useless opinion threads in the last week or so. Please just stop it. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:03:20
I seriously hope you get banned. And every dumb ass annoying kid after you who posts that image. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:41:27
Fuck me! You've got some serieus issues dude. 
I might give your mommy a call. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:45:18
You can type all you want, fact is you are an annoying prick for asking the same thing that has been explained 70 times already. You could've used the search. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:22:42
The theories you kids come up with. My god. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:22:59
They will never learn. 90% of them will end up with less coins than they would have if they hold. 
Can't feel sorry for them. It happened so many times before so it's not like they couldn't have learned from it. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:37:20
Please stop answering these people. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:05:39
The next person who types "only invest what you can afford to lose" should be shot in the knees. 
I'm so tired of reading it 50 times a day. Mainly because it's so fucking obvious and EVERYONE knows this rule already. 
It's like posting "if you jump in front of a car you might get hurt" all day long. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:09:46
Jesus dude. Get a fucking clue. Right now you look like an idiot. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:07:15
Ah ok. It's a good thing that China blocks Bitcoin because the value was 140 dollars before. Ok. I got it. 
And of course that's why it's also better that more USD are traded now. Makes perfect sense. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 09:35:45
Here's a hint: they do this on purpose; they don't give a shit.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:03:13
Stop answering these people. Please. It's the only way to stop this. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:46:13
Wtf are you talking about you idiot?
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:28:51
Yeah. That's the way to go. Spend 8 hours a day to make 0.0002 free bitcoin. Just don't get a real job. That would be silly. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:40:54
Stop begging!
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:39:54
Odd, i could swear i was in the Bitcoin reddit. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:37:21
Uh no? 
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:49:21
How many more times are you gonna post this?
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:20:26
The title is enough to know the video will be total bullshit as well. As always. Who the fuck listens to that idiot and why would you even post it here. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:46:40
Your analysis is completely worthless. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:15:57
Yup, i'm totally convinced now. You Einstein you!
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:08:41
Come on man! This has been discussed SO MANY times! Just do a search and read one of the 100 threads if you want opinions.
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:17:02
Educate yourself before you post this nonsense.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:04:20
You just sold your house and everything you own to buy coins right? OR are your facts not really facts?
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:32:16
You are the first to post this. No really. 
This hasn't been posted 2000 times since 2009. Believe me. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:13:36
Make sure not to use the search and instead ask the same question that has been asked and answered 50 times before. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:09:20
Because someone pulls some facts out of his ass it's been explained? Is that how it works for you?
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:45:39
MUST READ!!!! ZOOOOMMGG!!!1! look at me! I'm so important i'm gonna tell you what you need to read IN CAPS!!!1
@_date: 2013-11-27 10:36:40
1: this is asked 20 times a day, every single day. And it's annoying as hell. 
2: what makes you possibly think that people here can look into the future. Why even bother asking this? Can't you see it's impossible to answer?
@_date: 2013-11-24 12:12:20
Make sure not to read the faq and use the search. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:20:46
Kids like you usually end up losing money. 
It's fun to watch. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:16:12
You seriously think this wasn't posted several times already?
@_date: 2013-12-13 12:13:07
You think Bitcoin will put all the banks out of business soon?
You must be smoking some good meth. 
I very much believe in Bitcoin but even i wouldn't come up with something this ridiculous. 
Let's just hope you are 16. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:38:07
Banks protecting people? What planet are you from?
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:08:29
There is nothing of course about it. Nobody knows where it will go. Not even you. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:12:17
Stop it already man.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:53:15
We? Who is we? As far as i know it's China who made Bitcoin big. 
But really who is we? Reddit? America? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:46:42
Stalking? I don't even know who the fuck you are. Just don't post the same shit over and over again and you won't see me in your threads. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:53:12
Look you idiot, 20 people a day start a post here asking us to look into the future. Guess what? Nobody here actually can. 
And the mining part. 20 people a day have the same question. It's been answered several 100 times already. Which you would've noticed if you didn't refuse to use the search. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 12:30:19
You start at the link called "getting started" on your right. 
Crazy, i know. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:34:13
Yes we know you idiot! It's been posted 5 times already! Are you blind?
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:11:53
No. Go read one of the 50 similar topics if you want opinions. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:01:49
My god! 50 fucking threads about a fucking car that got bought with Bitcoin! This place is completely retarded!
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:38:19
Stop the reposts! You are not the first to post this! Just keep that in mind next time you are about to post an article!
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:11:27
Haha silly kid. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:29:33
You dumb fucking kids here believe anything.
@_date: 2013-12-30 08:03:16
Wrong subreddit. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:03:41
What kind of fucking answer do you expect?
I don't get these kind of threads. It's just so dumb. 
You ask random kids on Reddit if you should buy bitcoins or not. Seriously wtf?
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:56:58
Discussed in several threads already. Look to your right. There is this thing called a search. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:04:55
Is that one of those 40 hours of work will make you 0.002 Bitcoin sites?
It scares me those exist because people use them. Really wtf?
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:01:43
Yes we know. It's been posted all fucking day long!
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:52:17
This hasn't been discussed before. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:41:55
Yeah, we got it the first 10 times it was posted. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:47:29
Thanks. This hasn't been discussed 30 times already in the last 2 weeks.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:07:57
You realize everyone can make a site a write words on it, right?
Grow up. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:41:16
It was funny the first time it got posted 6 months ago. Now after 50 times not so much anymore. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:04:24
I don't see it happening that soon but i do see 10k as totally possible since we reached 1000. And not by 2016 but way sooner. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:45:33
It's retarded. That's what is wrong with it.
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:03:00
No. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:50:24
A person in China uses Bitcoin? It goes THAT deep!!! No way! Really that damn deep?
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:17:31
Why do people keep trying this? It's so pointless. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:58:04
Thanks. We don't have charts. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:29:17
So do you? Do you stand on the street corner begging people for pennies or do you have some dignity in real life?
@_date: 2013-12-30 04:08:04
News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:31:20
Stop the fucking reposts you idiots! How hard can it be?
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:14:32
Use the fucking search!
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:23:03
Jesus man! It's been posted 10 times! How do people still not know to search before posting? Don't you see the 50 reposts a day?
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:44:33
Come on man! Use the fucking search! It's been answered 100 times already!
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:36:41
So how many 100's of coins are you buying?
Oh and can't you fucking see half a dozen people before you already posted this? You seriously think you were the first?
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:58:37
Use the search and the faq please. It's ALL there. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:26:32
Yes we see that you fucking retard. We have internet and access to charts. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:57:22
Stop it already you goddamn morons! Idiot!
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:49:40
Yes there is. It was almost a copy his previous post where he used Ebay instead. I pointed that out but nobody cared. Because this place is full
of delusional kids who want to become a millionaire with 0.3 bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:03:18
Yes of course it's true. How can you possibly think this isn't true. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:45:54
Idiot. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:49:16
Yes, a person on Reddit called newhampshire22 can look into the future.
No seriously, why do you even ask? And not just you but 20 people a day post the same thing.
Wtf is wrong with you people?
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:49:06
Use the goddamn search man! It's been seriously answered 100+ times. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:54:49
Wtf? Tons of people are making shitloads. What are you talking about?
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:10:37
Haha someone downvoted you!
@_date: 2013-12-22 10:00:59
Can those who downvote me maybe come up with a reason why i'm wrong or something?
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:16:41
Make sure you don't read the links on the sidebar. They are there for no reason at all. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:09:31
These posts are so retarded. I wish it would just stop. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:48:07
Come on man. It's over 1 week old and posted about 30 times. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:46:31
Has been answered at least 100 times already. But just make sure not to use the search. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:11:56
Petition to ban annoying kids like you. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:07:39
And with all the variations probably closer to 300. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:48:15
Use the fucking search! My god!
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:51:35
Use the goddamn search you prick!
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:42:33
Got any more old news that has been posted 10 times already?
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:07:24
ZOOOMGGG!!1 LOOK AT ME I'M SO IMPORTANT!!
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:07:35
You got it all figured out!
@_date: 2013-12-30 13:50:17
His gpu will probably die before he makes an amount enough to buy a new one. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:44:50
You have to be a complete idiot to use those sites. Basically you totally failed in life if that's how you make money. I seriously can't think of one job in the world that pays less than that. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:34:17
You have a crystal ball i assume or are you just pulling facts out of your ass?
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:17:55
I did read it. You are spamming and begging and basically being an annoying clueless idiot. I suggest not spending any time and money on this. You will fail. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:08:16
Most stupid idea i read in a long time. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:31:55
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:58:25
Nobody knows so yes it's possible. I can believe you put money in Bitcoin before even realizing this. There is no guarantee whatsoever that you will make profit. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:36:59
This silk road thing is getting hilarious. If someone said this was all a big joke by some trolls i would believe it. 
What a bunch of fucking idiots. Unbelievable. 
The best part is how these drug users and dealers think they are on some kind of mission to save the world. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:57:46
Idiot. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:00:28
Jesus Christ! Stop the fucking reposts you retards!
@_date: 2013-12-20 08:21:59
In all caps! That makes you message extremely important! 
I can't wait to spend the coming week 8 hours a day to make 20 cents in Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:34:19
Why do you think there is a FAQ on your right? Take a guess.
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:45:53
Looks legit. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:35:21
You got it all figured out. Amazing. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:28:48
There are 100 of these worthless threads already. You really had to start another one?
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:52:49
You really think this wasn't posted already?
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:05:50
Stop the fucking reposts! You see that shit gets reposted here 50 times a day. So why don't you do a search before posting something yourself? How fucking hard can it be!
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:04:20
Amazing! You got it all figured out. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:43:01
Come on man! This has been asked and answered at least 50 times! Why do you people REFUSE to use the search! Why?!
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:05:26
This is hilarious. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:58:23
Just keep refusing the search and instead ask the same thing that has been asked and answered about 200 times already. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 11:46:42
It's not breaking news you idiot!
Several troll box kids before have posted these silly hype tweets already. 
It's always the same when it comes to Litecoin. Kids, hype, caps, pump and dump. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:19:06
Use the goddamn search! Why you think it's there!
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:34:18
Sure. Everyone can make a prediction. Asking people on Reddit what the Bitcoin price will do and invest depending on that is as retarded as it can get. Might as well throw a dice. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:21:34
Because begging is the lowest of lows?
Get a job you pathetic idiot. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:23:19
God, you are a moron. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 11:20:09
What kind of answer do you expect here on Reddit? Seriously, why even bother asking. 
Here is the answer: maybe. 
Did that help you?
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:40:20
Stop it already you fucking idiots!
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:30:29
Only when they are fucking idiots. 
Why don't you answer my question?
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:16:08
And how many 1000's of Bitcoins did you buy this week?
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:23:54
Then you know there is no guarantee whatsoever the price will keep going up, right?
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:41:08
I love reading these stories. Panic sellers highly amuse me. Even after reading 100 warnings not to do it they still do it and then come crying here how they lost their coins! I love it!
@_date: 2013-12-10 10:59:50
Did you seriously think you are the first to post this? Come on!
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:37:44
Yes it's Wallstreet. Obviously. 
It has nothing to do with China dumping insane amounts of coins. 
Those sneaky Wallstreet guys!
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:13:09
Stop these fucking posts you fucking morons!
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:47:05
1 word: hookers and coke!
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:15:34
No, nobody has experienced this before. First time we hear about this. Really. And make sure not to use the search!
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:35:48
Get a real job?
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:25:37
You can't possibly think you are the first to post this?
@_date: 2013-12-22 06:34:39
Every other day someone posts how the government might pay their debt with those coins. Seriously, what kind of fantasy land do you kids live in? Don't you have any sense of reality whatsoever?
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:13:23
Thanks. We didn't know this. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:51:33
There is such a thing as reading and learning you know. Ever heard of it?
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:42:00
ALL CAPS! Zoommmgg!!1! Look at me i'm so important!!!
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:29:03
The answers in this thread is the perfect example why that charts is completely useless. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:47:02
Target value haha. 
Go back to your troll box kiddo. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:21:40
What make you think you will get your money back? Get back to reality dude. Have you EVER heard of a casino returning money?
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:21:14
Why would anybody send money to a huge drug dealer who made 100 million and tried to get 6 people killed?
Oh right he used Bitcoin so it's all good. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:27:39
Stop asking the same thing 30 times a day you fucking idiots! NOBODY here knows what Bitcoin will do. Nobody! How fucking hard is it to understand that!
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:38:57
People should be banned for asking this. This is getting totally stupid. 
Use the goddamn search you idiot!
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:52:26
What a sad fucking life you must have to beg for money. It's pretty much as low as one can get. 
Pathetic fucking kid. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 05:21:15
How is he getting involved? Oh wait, you just pulled that out of your ass. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:01:44
Let me guess. You are one of those kids who posted something dumb before and i called you stupid. Am i right?
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:41:29
You're the 5th person to post this ridiculous theory. 
They should make this place 18+. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:43:59
Idiot. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:56:21
Use the search. There are 50 threads on the subject. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:40:23
90 dollars? Really?
@_date: 2013-12-28 10:58:01
Thanks. We didn't know this yet. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:09:11
Thank you thank you. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:42:30
Holy shit! You still haven't figured out it was a troll!?
You people are so gullible. 
It was the same idiot who did the Ebay thing. And he will be back again with another bullshit story and you dumbass kids will fall for it again. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:15:07
Looks legit. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 22:04:28
Reeaaaally? We had no idea!
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:44:55
Apple is laughing behind your back and calling you sucker. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 10:22:57
Nonsense. You have no clue who or what he is. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 09:24:11
Funny enough it's always the most clueless people posting that pic. I'm SO tired of seeing it!
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:09:11
Yes it's been posted 10 times already. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:34:07
Please stop it with these threads!
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:38:16
MUST READ ZOOOMFGGG!!111!!
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:48:21
Completely worthless topic. Really fucking totally worthless. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:31:38
ALL CAPS!! ZOOOOMGGG LOOK AT ME I'M SO IMPORTANT!!!!1
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:05:51
Pump, dump, move on to next alt coin. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:35:36
He's right. You must be making tons?
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:30:45
Hack? What hack?
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:25:44
Ok. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 12:24:21
You still don't know how to avoid reposts? How long have you been here?
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:48:12
Using the search is faster and less work than starting a thread you dumbass. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:58:41
Discussed at least 100 times before. Please stop making posts about this. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:14:05
Stop the goddamn reposts!
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:54:05
Bullshit. I bet i can find at least 100 topics that answer your question within seconds. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:42:56
Panic sellers make my day. I love to read their cry stories how they lost their money. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:09:20
Yes we know. You're not the first person trying to start a Bitcoin circle jerk over it. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:52:21
If you wouldn't REFUSE to use the search you would find this has been asked and answered about 150 times already.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:53:36
If only these posts would stop. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:04:28
My god! Stop these fucking posts you idiots! This is insane!

Stop the fucking reposts!
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:47:56
Reported. Not Bitcoin related. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:18:44
Nobody knows. That's only correct answer. You could've figured that yourself of course. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:49:18
Got any more 3 month old news?
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:44:09
Yes i have a suggestion. Use the goddamn search!
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:35:22
Haha, just noticed that.  
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:16:15
Amazing how many dumb fucking broke ass kids are running a "social experiment" lately.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:55:32
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:40:14
You are pretty full of yourself aren't you. 
So young and dumb and thinks he knows it all. 
When you get 21+ you will realize how retarded you looked at your current age. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 08:33:19
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:17:07
Wtf is tippercoin? 
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:14:49
You want people here to tell you how to make money with money? Really?
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:24:14
Do we really need 5 posts a day about this!
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:39:05
Yes, we know. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:12:07
This hasn't been discussed 230 times before. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:11:23
Real smart to post that in public. You sound like a real Einstein. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:10:48
Really? Please tell us more. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:18:37
Life is so easy when you're 16. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:21:24
Stop answering these people. Let them learn how to use the search. 
This (dumb) question has been asked at least 200 times. It has to stop. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:09:14
It's clear this guy is clueless and doesn't have the social skills to get this going. Nobody will trust a kid like him. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:46:10
Haha you fucking pathetic idiot. 
Ok go back to begging for pennies thing.
Edit: you do realize you just answered a question of mine? You're not the brightest are you?
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:23:12
Please panic sell. Just do it!
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:46:54
You look like you have an extremely low IQ. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:26:15
You really think this hasn't been posted yet?
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:25:22
1 thing i noticed here is people with a small amount of coins are the most delusional. People with a lot of coins don't post stupid shit like memes and to the moon all day. The also don't post how a Bitcoin will be worth 100k by next year and nonsense like that. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:09:00
Cool man. You started your own China thread. Of course explaining how we're actually better off with Bitcoin being "banned" in China. 
You're one of the kids now!
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:20:04
ZOOOMMMMGGG111!1 MY TOPIC TITLE IS ALL CAPS BECAUSE I'M SUPER DUPER IMPORTANTS!!!1
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:57:27
Why use the search and read through the 300 similar post when you simply can start a new thread right?
@_date: 2013-12-22 12:57:58
Reality sucks, right?
@_date: 2013-11-24 10:59:44
Reposts are the best when the news is several days old!
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:31:32
Jesus man. Use the goddamn search or just browse the fucking page for 30 seconds!
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:49:18
Dollar collapse a done deal? What planet do you kids live on?
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:40:27
Disgusting. I hate seeing people beg for money. Especially someone with working arms and legs. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 09:51:43
I haven't heard anybody saying you can make them. I don't think we need your "tip". 
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:30:53
I'm reporting you. I hope you get banned for spamming and begging. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:51:39
Stop helping these people. You only make it worse. If we don't answer these posts anymore they sooner or later will figure out how to use the search. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 06:37:10
Yes they sold legal stuff as well. Haha i love that argument. Ironically it's always used by druggies. Anyway, what % of silk road users strictly bought legal stuff with their coins you'd say? 0.001? Something like that?
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:22:55
There are already plenty of legitimate uses for bitcoins. But it's also being used to anonymously buy drugs, hire assassins, trade child porn and dodge taxes -- and that has drawn the attention of U.S. lawmakers.
Imagine every article about the dollar mentioning this!
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:38:20
Silly kid. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:01:24
Already posted. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:15:13
Stop asking these questions you idiots!
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:59:30
Jesus christ! Fucking stop it already! This is insane!
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:20:12
You really think you are the first to post this? Really?
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:52:46
Then please piss off here. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:19:54
Yes, we know. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:18:23
Stop begging you fucking idiot. Do you beg for pennies on the street as well or just on the internet?
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:30:40
How fucking hard can it be to not repost shit 20 times a day? Really, explain it to me! Everybody sees the shitloads of reposts here. So how can you possibly not think "let me check this first" before posting something yourself?
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:13:51
Yes we know goddamn idiot! It's been posted every 5 mins for hours already! Are you fucking blind?
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:02:25
Look to your right! You can read right?
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:24:51
A drug dealer who made 100 million or whatever and tried get get 6 people killed. Can't wait to donate.
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:06:31
The price was way below 900 for a few days. But how many cheap coins did you buy today? 50? 200? More?
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:58:17
Every 30 minutes someone starts a topic like you. It's getting quite annoying. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 10:23:18
Go away you idiot and stop fucking begging. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 11:04:03
Reading your replies it's pretty clear why you fail in life. You have a low iq and feel really important. And i'm pretty sure there are plenty more reasons why people don't like you. But obviously you're the type of person who always blames others for your failures. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 07:32:26
Asia? Source?
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:17:12
140 people before you made similar posts. Please just stop it. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:26:09
How long have you been here? Basically anything gets posted minutes after it appears on the internet. You can't possibly think a day later you are the search to post this.
Why don't you use the search next time before posting so we can get rid of the 50 reposts a day here.
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:01:13
So you know this gets asked a lot but instead of doing a search you ask it again.
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:02:44
That 2nd guy sent a Bitcoin to a random guy and now is crying he got scammed? Really?
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:18:03
Thanks. Only 100 people before you posted something similair. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:45:54
That's so deep man. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:39:08
Stop making threads about it every 30 minutes!
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:20:38
Awesome, another worthless opinion thread. I love how we have 10 of those a day. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:14:47
A lot of really young people here living in Bitcoin fantasy land. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:38:58
Theymos is only sitting on a couple of million in Bitcoin donations. You can't expect him to run any real good software. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:30:28
So that's why you started a new thread instead of posting in an existing one. As in said you fail at the internet. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:47:45
Yes we know you idiot. 300 people before you posted the same thing. That's what you get for using those crooks. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:07:16
 Stop trolling you dumbass. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:28:32
Thanks for the updates every 2 mins. 
Annoying kids. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:40:52
Discussed in so many threads before. Please man. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:35:06
You just sold your house and everything you own to put in Bitcoin right? I mean with these facts you'll be rich 24 hours from now. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:49:12
Any proof this is an attack by a nation against Bitcoin or just a lot straight out of your ass talking?
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:48:17
Yes we know you goddamn idiot! 50 people before you posted it already!
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:21:15
I seriously hope the next person to post this will get shot. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:15:59
If you lose some dollars would you say the dollar scammed you?
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:27:27
Mods, please start banning. We're seeing 5 to 10 posts a day like this now. It will only get worse. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:26:44
Use the search!
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:19:19
Discussed so many times before. Do a search. And stop using caps. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:22:29
You really think you are the first to post this?
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:40:58
Cool man. You now have your own China thread. I mean why post in one of the 40 existing ones when you can start a new one. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:44:47
Yes, that must it. An article. Yup. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:28:33
I've got news for you. Nobody here can look into the future. Yeah i know, it's crazy. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:59:31
Already posted. Of course. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:35:31
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:49:14
Stop asking this every 15 minutes you idiots!
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:13:58
Wow! Amazing idea! I never read such a thing before!
@_date: 2013-12-31 05:32:50
@_date: 2013-11-24 09:19:43
You'll be here next week crying how they screwed you over. So please just don't. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:17:18
Come on man. Use the search and post in one of the dozen topics about it. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:38:41
Yes we know. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:39:51
A lot of capslock warriors lately. I guess they all feel their posts are more important than others. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:19:50
These threads....please just stop. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:12:37
Sockpuppet? Haha wtf? Yeah you got me kiddo!
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:32:13
Your friend is pulling facts out of his ass. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:54:06
Guess what. Nobody here can look into the future. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:52:30
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:52:04
Did you seriously think you are the first to post this? Come on?
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:18:40
Drugs blah blah guns yadiya. Lets ignore the 1000's of legal shops because that's boring. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:49:52
Stop it with these posts you idiot. You are almost more annoying than the people asking the same shit 50 times a day.
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:08:40
Can't you see it's already been posted? I can so why can't you?
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:57:41
* 1: Use the search, read the FAQ
* 2: Use the search, read the FAQ
* 3: Use the search, read the FAQ
* 4: Use the search, read the FAQ
* 5: Use the search, read the FAQ
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:27:11
The caps make it extra important!
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:33:57
What makes you think this hasn't been posted before?
@_date: 2013-11-24 12:55:37
One of my farts probably. They have killed many things before. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:02:11
Unreadable. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:39:53
Once again i'm pretty sure when talking about a random rapist (who doesn't use Bitcoin) your reaction would be quite different. Less tolerant. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:16:33
Yeah it's pathetic as fuck. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:13:26
Oh it's that freak again. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:17:20
Nobody here knows more about what the price will do than you know. Nobody! Why do you people (20 a day asking the same question) fail to realize this! 
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:51:34
He is not a messenger. He is obviously behind this. You really can't see that? 
Now that you know this you should think about it for a minute why he is spamming like this. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:40:57
Here we go again.
For the 150th time: read the sidebar and use the search. It's all been answered 100's of times. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:06:51
No haha you're not really that old. That would be crazy! Stop trolling!
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:34:03
How old are you?
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:59:14
And another worthless post. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:44:48
Annoying prick!
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:55:23
Stop these posts you idiots! Fuck!
@_date: 2013-12-22 06:51:04
How's life as a multi millionaire?
@_date: 2013-12-20 06:33:49
Just make sure not to use the search. Instead annoy us by asking the same question for the 200th time. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 05:45:05
Yes we know. Another kid posted it 30 mins ago. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 06:14:59
I've seen a lot of people being butt hurt they missed the boat or sold their coins for a few dollars. But you, man, you take it to a whole new level. Unbelievable. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:16:08
Please stop answering these people or it will never stop. Let them learn how to use the search. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:21:03
And another worthless thread. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:47:07
Please stop posting this over and over and over again. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:36:32
What is a shady IP?
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:26:12
Because i'm right and everybody is tired of seeing these threads 20 times a day. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:38:46
At the link called "getting started" to your right. 
Crazy, i know. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 13:55:56
Use the search! It's all been answered 100 times before!
@_date: 2013-12-28 17:05:37
Idiot. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:10:25
What you should do is stop asking these ridiculous questions. 
What makes you possibly think anybody here can look into the future! And also this gets asked 20 times a day and everybody is sick and tired of it!
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:47:45
Idiot. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:22:46
You really think this hasn't been posted already?
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:20:42
Please tell me you panic sold and bought and lost half your money. I so enjoy reading that shit!
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:21:55
Fuck off you dumbass kid. 
Oh and i have advise for you. Don't invest more than a dollar because you are totally fucking clueless. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:41:15
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:55:15
Awesome man. You know have your own China thread. Like the other 120 people. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:40:09
Yes we know. You're not the first to start this specific circle jerk. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:07:52
Why do you refuse to use the search?
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:05:26
Come on man! It was a fucking troll! Sweet Jesus!
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:21:46
It hit the media days ago. What are you talking about?
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:22:31
We managed to bring Bitcoin to the Chinese? What?
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:31:04
You seriously think you are the first to post this? Come on man!
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:02:05
I think he tried to manipulate. Tried to crash the price and buy back cheaper. It backfired and he just lost a shitload of money. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 01:47:17
What happens is that people will keep starting threads about it instead of reading one of the existing 100 threads. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:25:35
Thanks. We didn't know this yet. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 22:42:16
Take a guess. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 16:24:56
Ah, that's a fact of course?
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:15:01
Wow, nobody has thought about this before.
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:22:21
You seriously think you are the first to come up with this? Come on. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:39:44
Experts haha!
Fucking dumbass troll. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:36:48
I love it when panic sellers lose their money. It's so much fun to watch. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 06:44:11
Are you 16 or what?
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:49:55
Amazing how i'm talking to the only person on the planet who knows what Bitcoin will do. What are the odds!
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:02:02
You fail at the internet. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:02:12
People are afraid. Because every time the price goes up someone dumps a few k coins and everyone panics. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:06:17
Insider haha. 
So first you work for Ebay then Starbucks and now your are a bank insider. 
Sure kiddo. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:48:12
Stop asking the same questions that have been asked and answered 200 times already!
Why do you people REFUSE to use the search??
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:04:41
Someone dumped some coins and the usual idiots panic sold. 
Can't you figure that out yourself?
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:20:48
My god...this again? Seriously? And of course every time you idiots randomly pick another time period. As long as you can make it fit somewhere.
And then of course the "we are here" part. Which is somewhere completely different everytime one of you kids posts that completely fucking worthless graph.
Just stop doing it, ok?
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:36:25
The price will drop. You couldn't figure that out yourself?
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:45:05
Thanks but nope. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:00:30
Yes. It will stay at 900 forever. Obviously. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:40:23
Is this written by a 15 year old?
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:32:02
You're being sarcastic right?
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:28:34
Huh? What kind of logic is that?
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:08:39
Stop answering these people! Please! Let them learn how to use the search!
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:08:57
I don't mind new people but they keep asking the same question over and over again. It drives me crazy. The mods should make a sticky post or something. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 13:02:36
Step away from the keyboard. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:17:12
You start ok? Ah no, you're a broke 16 year old. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:27:07
Another opinion thread on something no one on this planet can predict. 20 a day. 
Can you people just stop?
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:20:18
Why does that name make me want the kick the shit out of something?
@_date: 2013-11-26 11:03:42
Make sure not to use the search to find this has been answered about 200 times already in the last 2 months.
No, instead start a new thread about it.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:03:31
Stop answering these people! Please. 
It's insane. It's been asked and answered 200+ times. Let these idiots learn how to use the search or read the faq. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:41:24
He tried to get 6 people killed. 
Amazing how you people ignore this "detail". 
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:29:43
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:12:37
Stop answering these people. It has to stop at some point. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:44:42
You're missing some braincells. Otherwise you'd know how to use the search. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:27:07
What's the weather like on your planet?
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:35:20
It's obvious your post is way more important than the others here so i totally understand your caps usage. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:37:13
No. You can't get them back.

Maybe you can answer my question as the OP apparently won't. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:06:46
Wow, nobody has thought about this before. It's the first time i see someone post this here. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:34:32
Stop the fucking reposts!
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:22:24
Come on man, it's been posted 10 times already.
@_date: 2013-12-22 06:41:15
You can write endless amounts of text and pretend you know it all while 1 sentence would've been enough: I, like everyone else on this planet, have no idea whatsoever what Bitcoin will do tomorrow. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 08:49:37
Explain to me why you refuse to use the search?
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:23:15
Awesome that you started the 50th thread about it. This time it's even better because of the caps! Makes you look even more important!
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:48:14
Stop crying. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:10:13
Buy some and send it to your wallet. There are a lot of kids lately who want to know if their wallet works. It's simply begging. And annoying as fuck. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:27:02
Pulls out the ol' crystal ball again. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 11:01:07
Get a fucking job you fucking loser. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:10:17
Piss off with your spam and caps. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:12:54
Thanks for starting the 10th thread about it. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:38:20
About what?? Cars? Dogs?
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:15:06
You're wrong. It's Thermos. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:10:51
Don't tell me you are from '68 because you seriously sound like a 16 year old kid. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:15:57
People who do this are extremely annoying. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:24:45
What you should do is ask random strangers on the internet who have no fucking idea whatsoever what Bitcoin will do what you should do with your money. That's what all the smart people do. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:09:04
I read the same post 6 months ago and after that about every 2 days. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:03:58
What's up tight?
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:37:02
Here's another piece of advice. Don't listen to broke 16 year olds on the internet. 
And also Bitcoin is a currency, not a way to get a rich. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:37:34
Make sure not to use the search. Instead ask something that has been explained in 200 posts. I mean why use the search, right. Fuck it!
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:34:33
In your impression. Ok then. So they are not facts but just opinions?
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:01:31
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:54:10
Yeah they are shady as fuck. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:43:12
Amazing how it took me 3 seconds to find out and most of you days. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:11:35
Yes, please provide some proof that they will bring it up to 8000. I'm waiting. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:37:32
Yes. We know. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:51:17
He will now find another excuse why that wouldn't help him. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 06:03:31
Yes we know you idiot! It's been posted about 20 times 3 days ago. What's wrong with you people!
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:45:57
Sidebar. Faq. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:49:14
What amazes me more is that it didn't start any panic selling whatsoever. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:46:12
These people posting that shit here are so lucky i'm not in the same room as them. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:08:14
After 15 threads about this did you really need to start a new one?
@_date: 2013-12-02 09:47:13
Couldn't you just use the search and read the many other threads with the same subject instead of starting yet another one. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:16:20
Not really. 90% are kids with 0,5 coin which they will never spend. They just want Newegg to accept Bitcoin so the price of Bitcoin goes up. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:00:48
Ah caps lock. You must be a really important person. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 04:12:02
And who the fuck can answer this you think? 
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:33:38
I take it he hates Dollars as well then?
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:11:07
All caps. Your post is more important than other posts i take it?
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:04:51
Cool man. Another China thread with an opinion. Haven't seen one of those in like 10 minutes. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:40:23
You are in doubt if this is a scam? You're joking right 
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:12:26
Use the goddamn search ffs!
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:39:01
You really think you are the first to post this?
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:18:39
Yeah and read the faq before asking questions you can answer yourself. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:35:49
Why is it a good thing? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:09:14
Use the fucking search you annoying idiot! It's been asked and answered 100 times already!
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:05:55
You can check my history but you refuse to use the search? If you would have done that you'd find 300 similar posts as yours and you wouldn't annoy everyone here by starting yet another one. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:40:46
This hasn't been discussed before. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:11:55
You probably will spend more on electricity running your laptop. 
I just don't understand these things. Even in bed i probably could find 20 better ways to make money. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 13:03:30
I don't because nobody knows what Bitcoin will do. Even arrogant little punks like you don't. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 11:48:33
People posting that worthless graph should be banned. I'm so fucking tired of seeing idiots like you just randomly adding it to Bitcoin graphs and telling us where we are. 
Do you realize that every other day there is another clueless kid who tells us where we are. Of course it's ALWAYS somewhere else. 
Not only does it not apply to Bitcoin, the 2 graphs don't even look like eachother. Wtf is wrong with you dumbasses!
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:46:21
How many of these "experiments" have we had already?
People begging for money is just so fucking pathetic. How much lower in your life can you get. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:53:27
So you're gonna waste time on getting pennies instead of finding a job?
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:45:26
All caps. You must be a real important person. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 06:05:52
Go find a job you rat! How fucking low in life do you have to get to beg for money? Sell your damn computer if you need money that bad!
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:05:10
Nobody here can look into the future you idiot! God, you people drive me nuts with these retarded questions!
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:43:55
Right. Lets see how much will be donated to random rapist. Allegedly. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:41:24
Haha that can be real. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:43:32
Life is really simple for you kids right?
Oh China doesn't like Bitcoin, lets move on to the next shithole country. As long as my 1.3 coins will be worth a milllliiiion bucks by the end of 2014.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:29:23
Lead what? And why would the US need to lead anything. We all know how that usually turns out. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:33:30
Holy shit! Capslock makes your topic title look so important!
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:42:23
Yup. You got it all figured out. Just like the 50 other kids the last 2 days. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:04:34
Awesome! Another I know it all thread about Bitcoin and China. Haven't seen enough of those the last few days. 
Funny how it's always broke 16 year olds who figured it all out. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:42:34
Like 0.1% maybe?
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:19:09
Please just stop with these Coinbase threads. We get it. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:10:03
No. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 09:10:30
You couldn't have done that before starting this topic?
@_date: 2013-12-22 06:38:09
More likely? Where did you pull this fact from?
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:49:23
Fucking annoying idiot! Dumbass kids here!
@_date: 2013-12-07 13:43:52
Yes, you got it all figured out. Now please go do it with real money and see how that works out for you. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:11:04
Wow all caps! ZOOOMMFG!!1 your post must be read! It's obviously more important than anything else here!
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:07:46
Yes we know you fucking retard! There are 50 posts about it!
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:40:28
So who is allowed behind the wheel instead?
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:32:46
What makes you think this has not been posted several times already?
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:56:22
Stop the damn reposts!
@_date: 2013-12-02 10:32:08
Jesus man! Stop fucking posting that shit!
@_date: 2013-12-30 06:42:22
Make sure you don't use the search. It would give you 300 threads how mining is a waste of time. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:52:30
You really think you are the first to post this? Come on. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:43:28
Yes you are an idiot!
I love reading these stories. I love it when panic sellers come crying here!
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:21:27
Cool man. Instead of posting in one of the 40 similar threads about China you started a new one! Awesome!
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:08:10
What happens is hopefully people start using the search instead of asking the same question for the 70th time.
