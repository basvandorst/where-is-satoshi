These dudes talk a lot about decentralization but don't seem to comprehend that if bitcoin cannot be used, and cannot be speculated, and cannot be converted, it has 0 value. Trading something of 0 value gets you 0 goods in return. You would think this math is straightforward but apparently not.

I think you will be pretty close

Incorrect. You can barely use it now. Probably less than 2011.
Even Microsoft on the fritz, going back and forth between accepting and not accepting it.
This is not an "inevitability".

Kind of uncanny yeah? I mean I hope the trend doesn't continue. Lots of people have made wild predictions before, but this is a huge jump UP and back DOWN in less than 2 months. With the correction right in the middle. Nothing is certain of course no one can predict that the price will drop down below 2k or 1k, and I'm not trying to cause panic. But it's a possibility.

I really thought it might be satire but it's got some dude's copyright on it!
