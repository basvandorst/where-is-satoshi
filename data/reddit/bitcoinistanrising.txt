Why should you trust any other road builder over Hitler? You shouldn't. All I'm saying is if you know Hitler's motives, and understand how it would make his blitzkrieg possible, you should toss his road-building bid into the trash right away. because as nice as autobahns are, you might want to hold off on his.
I'm further suggesting that your choice is not between Hitler building you a road and the Wicked Witch of the West building you one. You are capable of road-building yourself,  may want to hold off on roads altogether, or figure out, on a higher level, which of these strange bedfellows you'd want to battle once the initial goal has been reached (see: Allies choosing Soviet Union, which they loathed, over Hitler (whom they also didn't like much).

"The 17 July Revolution was a bloodless coup in Iraq in 1968, led by ~~General Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr~~ PayPal, which brought the Iraqi Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party to power. Both Saddam Hussein, later President of Iraq, and Salah Omar al-Ali, later a Ba'athist dissident, were major participants in the coup."--Wikipedia, the bloodless encyclopedia.
Is this how it happened?


No, we go back there and bomb them some more, until morale improves. Again, PayPal relevance: ZERO. 


I got a shocker for you, penny793. Sitting down? Good. Here: Islam != ISIS (you idiot). Don't project your shitty bigotry and ignorance on me.


There were *always* wars there, long before meddlesome PayPal came into power. Surprise!
Also, it's pretty hard to terrorize American Indians, half way around the world, when all you got is a towel, some goatshit, and, possibly, a scimitar. So that's why.

There's no custodial risk in DAOs either. Until there is.


I'm saying it is *like* a Bitcoin debit card, not that it *is* one. 
A Bitcoin-funded debit card lets you shop at any store that accepts Visa, while an LN payment channel you've opened with Bob only lets you buy shit from Bob. Or, rather, lets you buy nothing from anyone, because LN isn't a thing yet. While Bitcoin-funded debit cards are. So 2 good reasons we can't stick an equal sign between LN and BTC Debit cards right there.

3. There is no way for the Bitcoin locked up in LN payment channel to be worth more than the Bitcoin *not* locked in a LN channel, because reasons.
4. ...which is the whole fucking point of an investment.
∴ LN is not an investment.

My point was much simpler -- that anything, including a clever confidence scheme, could be seen as being beautiful.
Your mold analogy is neat, but only if you don''t think about it too long. The universe is one mess of symbiosis. Or not. Like mold, chickens and whales, crackheads and neutron bombs and anthrax all contribute to the ecosystem, all help to bring about Nature's current state. For what it's worth. Take away anything, and Nature would not be the same, by definition.
Is decentralization of molds the big attraction? The lower a lifeform, the less it depends on centralization. Humans are nowhere as resilient as molds or spores, due to having highly centralized structures, like brains and hearts and lungs. While mold is mold.

...and that's why nearly twice as many people were using Bitcoin 3 years ago, when its market price was $1,200. Because [Bitcoin] price only goes up if more people use it.
I think you may be having problems with this snippet: "This means high bitcoin tx fees are causing fewer people to use bitcoin." You may be reading it as "Due to high tx fees, fewer people are using Bitcoin today than used it last year, when the fees were lower." This, to me, is not the intended meaning, which is:
"More people would use Bitcoin if the fees were lower" -- a position as tenable (or not) as "more people would use PP if the fees were lower." 
True, this is not an unequivocal metaphysical absolute. Some people use PP because its high fees lend it an air of exclusivity, and may be disincentivized by lower fees. Some people are plumb crazy contrarians, and would stop using PP "just because." All I'm saying is that, overall, "More people would use Bitcoin if the fees were lower" statement is defendable.

Arrive from where? From Auntie's employer, where she [likely] gets most of her money? And she needs it to spend, because she dimed out all of her CCs, which lent her their money, for free, and pay her n cash back/buyer protection for the privilege?


You suppose that was her banking peeve? How often would you guess Auntie sends money abroad? Does she realize that she'll have to jump through hoops, send her personal info to some exchange, pay a fee to convert her filthy fiat into Bitcoin, so that, at the other end, the lucky recipient will have to do the same (to convert it back into fiat)? 
Does she know that's just one of the reasons why Bitcoin's promise of becoming remittance payment method of choice flopped so hard?

No mining -&gt; can't spend your coin; can also fork Bitcoin into uselessness.


Yes, free, nearly-instant transactions with anyone, anywhere. Those were the days :(
Attractive thing about cash, in order of importance (to me):
0. [Almost] universally accepted.
1. I don't need to pay cash to spend cash, e.g. no need to pay $1.15 to give my friend a dollar.
2. [Nearly] instant. Takes ~10 seconds to transact &amp; verify.
3. Requires no third parties: I hand that $1 directly to Bob, without having to rely on people in China.
4. Requires no hardware/access to the internet.


Of course. Never suggested otherwise.

In that case, when Bitcoin's market cap hits a trillion, and block reward hits zero, mining should be free. Owning a single USB miner will allow you to steal all teh bitcoins. Correct?
Since sarcasm gets lost in translation to interwebian, I'll answer: No, not correct. If it is cheaper to attack the network than to mine honestly, that's what miners will do. Such attacks will quickly reduce the market value of bitcoin (because insecure; could be stolen by a kid with a USB miner), thus acting as another negative feedback loop and reaching a new, lower, equilibrium.

@_date: 2016-12-15 13:33:23


No, it means no such thing. It simply means they've included no transactions in the block they solved. If you want your tx to be included in a solved block, you can rely on the remaining 80% of the miners, start mining yourself, and/or include a higher fee. Free market at work, a beautiful thing :)

You have a valid argument, but like all tautologies, it's unenlightening. You're basically saying that "Bitcoin's value is the sum total of its qualities (headless, censorship resistant, difficult to use and, now, having a long tx backlog)," which is true for all things.

It's not about large vs.small blocks, it's about the cost of  mining 1 BTC needing to approach the market price of 1 BTC -- that's how PoW secures the blockchain.

Yes. The CC network lends you money to buy stuff with. In the end of the month, you pay back the [zero-interest] loan.
LN network does the opposite: *You* lend your money to the LN network [pay in advance, before you buy anything], and then are able to buy up to the amount you prefunded your LN payment channel with. So more like a gift card network.

...which is only enough to secure *today's* market cap. Think about it like this: let's say that an average parking meter, once bashed open, nets you $50 in change. As a parking meter manufacturer, I attempt to construct the parking meter in such a way as to make the cost of bashing open my parking meter exceed $50. This, assuming ideal, rational actors (and not crackheads/tweekers), should make my parking meters immune to bash-open attacks. With me? OK.
Now assume that for magical reasons, US quarters, my parking meters' coins of choice, became 1,000 times as valuable as they are today. My parking meters haven't changed, but now each one contains up to $50,000. Still costs you $50 to crack them open tho. 
Riddle me this: Will my parking meters still offer the same level of security as they did when US quarters were worth $.25? Is that level, which once nearly guaranteed no busted-open parking meters, still sufficient?

I understand. What I'm saying is there are two possible outcomes:
1. Miners will find a [legitimate] revenue stream; network remains as secure as it is now.
2. Miners will not find a [legitimate] revenue stream, leaving the network open to [51%] attack; failure.
If you spend $10 to guard ~~ billion~~ $100, you probably shouldn't spend any less to guard $10,000 (without changing the game mechanics, like switching to a different type of security).

Allowing, for the time being, that he is the one buying 210 BTC worth of hashpower, by depositing his coin to a single ViaBTC address, visible to one and all on the immutable public ledger that is the blockchain, how is this in any way shady? 
A shitty investment? Probably. But no shadier than buying a bunch of mining rigs to mine BU blocks with.

Go [here](
Take your hashrate, divide it by current hashrate. This will give you the fraction of the 12.5 BTC block reward you're [likely] to get, when mining in a good pool. Blocks are solved at a rate of 1 every 9 to 10 minutes. The thing to keep in mind is the hashrate/difficulty grows pretty quick, and your earnings (@ your current hashrate) drop proportionately. Mining BTC on a gaming rig is grossly unprofitable, your hashrate will be far less than from a USB miner you can get, pretty much, for free. While electricity costs will be much higher.

As evidenced by nothing. This is the deepest, darkest sort of misinformation, so let me riff on it for a bit.
First of all, hashrate != the number of miners. That sort of thing died with one CPU = one vote, back in 2009, when a user was also a miner. Of course, if you had access to a server rack, you had access to more than one CPU, and so it never was about *one user = 1 CPU [core].*
The price of hashpower plummeted with GPU mining. A single GPU could do what it took thousands of CPU cores to do. It plummeted again with ASIC miners, with the current flock doing **~1 million times as many hashes per second as a quad core i7.** while being at most what, x10 as expensive as a single-CPU box? ASICs are way more efficient, too. Both in power consumption and rack real estate. A data center of CPU miners fits on your desktop.
So yeah, that's why hashrate is growing. It's the same miners upgrading/adding to their gear.

Of course, I'm not suggesting they'll be absolutely unnecessary. But only a fool would open a new channel to add $100, if doing so would cost him $1,000, so will likely seek a cheaper alternative to BTC.

No different than any other buyer/seller relationship. Seller sets prices, if those prove too high &amp; Buyer has an alternative, Seller drops price or goes out of business. This doesn't mean that Seller "don't choose what fees to charge."


Who's "we," and how do we go about voting on/doing it?


Rising price means that we should have [proportionately] greater protection. It should always cost more than 1 BTC to steal 1 BTC, regardless of what 1 BTC is worth.
If the current hashrate is securing a network worth roughly 11 billion dollars, it seems to follow that a network worth twice as much should cost twice as much to attack, no?

Why not? It's a continuum, with pure Communism on one end [you work for nothing, or 100% taxation] and pure Liberhell anarchy on the other [no taxes, no protection for the weak, public courts, no ...]


Bitcoin is not simple to use, and only solves one side off the trust equation. When you buy a laptop from Honest Bob who lives half a world away, Bitcoin makes sure that Bob gets your money. It fails to address what happens if, instead of your laptop, you get a brick. That's why things aren't as simple as they seem, and what made PayPal and CCs so popular: they solved both sides.

Because in the future, when block reward is nothing, miners will continue securing the network &amp; increasing their hashrate. Because miners aren't materialistic, have a strong sense of socialist civic duty, and care not for dirty money.


As non-miners, our only goal is to pay as little as possible for 100% secure, instant transactions. The miner's goal is to get paid as much as possible for every block they solve. These are diametrically opposed, so it's difficult to understand what it is you mean by "our only goal."


We can't even change the blocksize.


Feel free to brainstorm a few that both miners and users would agree on. I'll get you started:
1. ???
2. [...]
200. ???


What you clearly meant to say was "promises." Much like Communism promises justice and equality for everyone. LN guarantees nothing. Like Communism, it is an interesting, attractive idea. But only if you don't think it through.


Correct. As is the fact that the need to handle an infinite number of transactions will never exist, largely due to the fact that any finite number [of people] multiplied by any other finite number [let's say, of transactions] can never equal an infinite number. 
...and that's why handling an infinite number of transactions is not our goal, just as having an infinite amount of storage is not Bob's goal when upgrading his HD. Bob's no fool; knows full well that he'll outgrow his HD &amp; have to upgrade again. His goal is to meet his needs *in time*, satisfy his current &amp; near future needs; not to plan for the heat death of the universe. By that time, his storage demands may be greater, but the cost of storage might be lower. Progress marches on :)


Aha, your cunning plan works just as well for traffic conjestion: plow under all the roads leading into, let's say, NY, fill in the tunnels, and only maintain one lane of the GW Bridge, where the toll-taker will charge as much as the market would bear. 
Pop quiz: Will you go to ~~Bitcoin~~ NY to start your business? Or will you go to ~~Visa~~ San Francisco, where they not only let you drive for free, but greet you by lending you shitloads of money, also for free, while paying you ~~cash back~~ each time you drive past the tolls?
@_date: 2016-11-06 14:38:12


Miners don't see a heap of transactions. No more than they see the heap of transactions on a Bitcoin-funded debit card. They just see one. Miners charge as much per tx (rather, its size in bites) as they think the market would bear.

Is it because pools don't control the majority of hashpower, either directly (factory megamines) or indirectly? And that's why freethinking separate-and-distinct individuals speaking only for themselves and not for the Core team, which is not a team but a loosely-aligned assemblage of individuals, fly across the world to chat with other individuals, miners, and not major pool operators?


You either dramatically overestimate Bitcoin's mining arsenal, or [just as grossly] underestimate governments. I'm sure a billion dollars would buy all farms in China, no questions asked.


With 16 views?! Is that you, Fabio?


And the price of that hashrate dropped by about as much. Bitcoin ASIC tech didn't stand still.

Ditto. If Auntie's banking problems involved divisibility, e.g. being unable to divvy up a penny into small-enough peny shavings, *then* this would be a compelling argument. Most people I know don't even bend down to pick up a *whole* penny.


As a CC/cash user, Auntie doesn't see high transactions fees in her day to day life.


Ditto for long waits. She swipes her CC/puts cash on the counter, and seconds later the goods are hers.

No, it is the *possibility* of harm. Let me explain:
* If you scoot down my fire escape with my TV strapped to your back, you have caused me harm (my telly's gone).
* If you move into my hood, and have a penchant for stealing, you haven't. Albeit you have made it *more likely* that harm will come to me (in the form of my TV, scooting down my fire escape, on your back).

No, you would use LN instead. LN is no more Bitcoin than a MetroCard is USD. LN transactions are not Bitcoin transactions (which, by definition, happen on the Bitcoin blockchain).
@_date: 2016-11-06 14:28:13
Not sure I follow. Are you saying miners would *not* have to charge more per tx (or go out of business), if there are fewer tx? 
@_date: 2016-11-29 13:47:49


No, LN is more like a MetroCard that you could cash in. Prefunding a MetroCard allows me transact with a single counterparty: New York City Transit Authority. Much like prefunding an LN payment channel allows me to transact with a single counterparty, let's say Bob. Unlike a CC, which *lends* me money to transact with anyone.


For me, Visa requires *no trust* -- I risk *nothing*. Give you an example, show you what I mean:
I'm walking down the street and meet Anon, whom I don't know from a hole in the wall and do not trust. Anon lends me $5k, asking me to pay him back in a month. Q: In this scenario, how much do I need to trust Anon to accept this loan?


Let me explain how definitions work:
A = B is a definition. A = B &amp; C is a new,  a *different,* definition. You have *redefined* A by *expanding* your definition.


Unless there is a source more authoritative than the Bitcoin Wiki, it is the *current* definition of a Bitcoin transaction. 
Feel free to ~~expand~~ redefine it and re-write history to suit your ends. War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Or, rather, "Freedom is freedom &amp; also slavery."

No, "Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a particular country or socio-economic context, or is easily converted to such a form. The main functions of money are distinguished as: a **medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value**" --Wikipedia, the p2p encyclopedia
So the *last* attribute. 
Think of money as a capacitor as opposed to a battery (storage cell). A cap is an awful store of electrical charge, it leaks down real fast, often within seconds. Sometimes it's intentionally shunted with a resistor, to make it leak down even faster. That's what money is like: It's not meant to be a battery, it's meant to be a cap.

Not arguing larger blocks vs. LN, merely pointing out that LN, if it works per design, will reduce demand for blockspace.

No, even if all printers can now handle 50-page sentences (all wallet providers do update to SegWit), the only time 3.7MB blocks will happen will be when *everyone starts writing in 50-page sentences.* This is unlikely to happen, and that's why (non-trolling) SegWit proponents don't make the 3.7MB claim.

"Lend" in the sense of "tie up; can't use for anything else." As long as your coin is funding a payment channel, it's tied up in the LN network, you can't use it for anything else until you close the channel.
So think of it as "CDs with maturity date" -- you're arguably in control of your money (can pull principal - penalty fee any time), but can't use it for anything else while it's tied up in that CD.

Nah, you're the one who needs to learn how digital circuits work. 


There's your problem, right there. I said *clock rate* is directly proportional to *hashrate*, not to *joules-per-hash*. 
Miners currently chose to *not* downclock their gear because, while downclocked gear will optimise *joules-per-hash,* their overall profits will plummet. Due to gear and rack space not being free: they wouldn't be able to recoup the gear and real estate costs before their gear becomes obsolete. If something remains unclear, don't hesitate to ask.

But I do value Bitcoin. Much like I value Genalex Golden Lion KT88s and giant pangolins. 
Like the USD, Bitcoin has value. Unlike the USD, this value changes from minute to minute, and that's why 99% of the merchants that "accept Bitcoin" price their goods in ~~real money~~ fiat: because Bitcoin makes a shitty unit of account. 
Furthermore, Bitcoin, unlike the USD, is not accepted in most stores that I want to shop in, is difficult and time consuming to use, and therefore, much like a Genalex Golden Lion KT88 or a giant pangolin, makes lousy money. Both great, valuable things that I value and don't use as money. Are you beginning to understand?


OIC. Not other people who used to or wish to develop Bitcoin, but totally unrelated dudes that neither worked on Bitcoin, are currently working on Bitcoin, or ever wish to work on Bitcoin. I'll grant you that one: Core devs are, arguably, better than those who have nothing whatsoever to do with Bitcoin.
The reason for "arguably" is this: While Neither my mom, nor naked mole rats, have ever worked on Bitcoin, they also didn't *bar others from working on it and making it better.*

Well no. Otherwise, wages in countries with unemployment should fall to $0.01/hr as ~~workers~~ miners compete to get ~~any kind of pay~~ tx, and no one would ever go on strike. But unions [collusion] become a thing, giving workers *bargaining power*. They may not make any money while out of a job/on strike, but would make up for it later, with higher wages. 
The miners are also in a unique position: unlike minimal-wage labor, who pretty much have to store their wealth in fiat, miners can *sell* the coin they make. So long-term health of the ~~economy~~ Bitcoin ecosystem is not important to them -- when their gear becomes obsolete (less than a year), they're in no way invested in Bitcoin.

Let's not. Let's assume that you didn't manage to get the grenade you crave, because, while the prospect of driving nails with it seemed super attractive, you were discouraged by its illegality. Because you understood that if you got yourself that hand grenade, you'd be in your own backyard, not threatening anyone, simply minding your own business, and a person could come up to you and begin beating you with a bar and slam you on the ground. Or maybe he doesn't shoot you, maybe he just ties you up and locks you in his basement for a few years, you antisocial sperglord.


Luckily, both I and the people in power feel otherwise, so it doesn't matter. If you want to oppen-carry hand grenades, you'll have to either
1. Go to some Godforsaken armpit of the world, like Somalia, where you'll probably get away with such antics before Miss Manners unloads a few 7.62x39s into your belly.
2. Overthrow the people in power, possibly at the point of a Bulgarian AK, while remembering to point selfsame away from face.

You said that my definition of banks is unconventional.

Absolutely. Takes zero effort and very little dough. That's why completely irrelevant -- both sides could deploy that many in no time at all.


In all honesty, this is the first time I hear the phrase "high quality" used to describe a node. It's confusing enough when people call wallets "non-relaying full nodes," now you tell me there are low quality and high quality nodes? How does one tell, sans psychic abilities?

A strong argument for planned economy &amp; regulations.


Sure, Bitcoin works better when users are also miners (one CPU = one vote; user interests = miner interests). Things [predictably] didn't work out that way, because, as you said, "the mechanism that keeps the system in check hard to design." So Bitcoin lacks such a mechanism.
I agree with you, money begets politicking and attracts exactly the sort of people one would wish it *didn't*: selfish people, obsessed with power and, yes, *money*. If things were different, there's be no need for Bitcoin. If "making that into a strength" was trivial, Bitcoin wouldn't be much of an achievement. Something like that :\

Assuming that was your question: By coming back online, and forking the shit out of Bitcoin.


Absolutely is. 


Your premise is correct, there probably were more miners back then. Your inference, otoh, is flawed. A thousand people mining with CPUs/GPUs, combined, had much lower initial &amp; operating costs than any one of today's megamines. And, once they were done, the GPUs still had value -- to be resold or mine shitcoins. Unlike obsolete ASIC miners, which are a disposal liability :D

Well sure, you still need to open and close channels, but nowhere near as often as you need to transact -- most of your transactions will be off-chain. It's also conceivable to imagine LN *never* needing to close channels, if the adoption is broad enough.

Well yeah, identical it is not. If you're talking about actual Visa, as in CC, it lets you spend money you don't have, by lending it to you. LN will require you to prefund the payment channel with your money, before you can buy anything. So there's that.

1. While " - groceries" seems like a natural, and not like you'll die of starvation waiting for UPS/DHL truck to arrive from .de, it doesn't look like they accept bitcoins.
2. Though " - order food for BTC" does seem to accept BTC, one would have to visit Netherlands (.nl to fellow Americans) to accept delivery.  
3. " - pet food with BTC" seemed like an option, if you don't mind roughing it. So I went over to see what you can afford, with your .0134 BTC. Tried ordering you 2 packs of [$3.05 Busy Buddy Treats Berries, because what's not to love?]( The price, apparently. 2 x $3.05 is $12.20, in Bitcoin. Plus U.S. Delivery (4-6 days): $5.99.

Monomania. Idee fixe. 
I go:
There's nothing wrong mom.
She's all:
Don't tell me that, you're on drugs!
I go:
No mom I'm not on drugs I'm okay, I was just thinking you know, why don't you get me a Pepsi.
She goes:
NO you're on drugs!
I go:
Mom I'm okay, I'm just thinking.
She goes:
No you're not thinking, you're on drugs! Normal people don't be acting that way!
I go:
Mom just get me a Pepsi, please
All I want is a Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me
All I wanted was a Pepsi, just one Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me.
Just a Pepsi.

Perhaps. If Bitcoin is worth anything, with 70% of the hashpower thrashin' it like a red-headed stepchild.


What's have to do with anything? The locations of all the major mining farms are well known, do you really think the Chinese are too incompetent to set up a coordinated sting? And what kind of people do you suppose factory mine owners are, criminal paramilitary nutters hiding out in the bush? They're businessmen, in it for the money.
@_date: 2016-11-29 14:05:44


Right. And also to Bitcoin debit card transactions. And to transactions that happen on exchanges. Everything is a Bitcoin tx. As BashCo explained to me, we just need to *expand the definition* ~~to suit our needs~~ as technology evolves.


But as long as I can cash in the balance om my MetroCard, you'd have no objections, correct? Then MetroCard transactions would be $ transactions?
@_date: 2016-11-13 12:03:06


You mean tx fees are inversely proportional to BTC market price? Other than the fact that this has *never been* the case, it also goes against Bitcoins basic tenets: "The cost of mining 1 bitcoin approaches the market price of 1 bitcoin."

No, assuming no such thing. Sure, officials could be bribed to do just about anything -- look the other way if you run a meth lab or a kidney-harvesting factory. It is a market force, like any other. Officials calculate risk/reward ratio, and if the risks are considerable, the bribes must be considerable to compensate. That cuts into margin.


These officials who take bribes, they're civic-minded? How many locals do you suppose a factory mine employs? Not to imply that you're reaching or anything.

Look, just because, after years of hanging on reddit, you still don't know how Bitcoin works (or even grasp the fact that the age of a reddit account and Bitcoin knowledge aren't even loosely correlated), doesn't mean that everyone is ...what's the PC euphemism for "retarded"?
Let's hope it's a teeny bit clearer to you now.

Considering abt 0.001% of the world is currently using Bitcoin... why, that means the world would have to burn roughly x10 as much energy as it does today, just to run Bitcoin. If Bitcoin becomes a world currency :)

Sure, it probably does provide better privacy. But I don't care how much privacy I have, when there's [literally nothing to buy for USD]( (Screencap Of Teh Now). I mean, if my goal was to buy *nothing*, I may appreciate the privacy Bitsquare offers a bit more. 
@_date: 2016-11-04 14:49:11


Seems like a reasonable thing to have. Until you start thinking about exactly what that entails. Which is warehouses full of non-SHA256-ASIC miners, ready to go on line at a moment's notice. And a plan, a procedure, in place. And, of course, code, but that's relatively trivial.
The devil's always in the details.

I didn't ask you for a list, I'm asking you where *YOU* buy online.
Your list, for ammusement:
1.  Lists all the stores selling via BitPay, i.e. you pay BitPay in Bitcoin, BitPay pays retailers in fiat. Just like Bitcoin-backed debit/gift cards you rage against.
2.  sells nothing, is search engine. 
3.  is powered by BitPay; see (1).
4. bitify is an Australian registered Bitcoin and Litecoin marketplace and **auction site**.
5.   is powered by BitPay; see (1).
6.  is in .nl. Unless you live in .nl, they won't deliver.
6.  sells overpriced pet food and charges outrageous shipping. Unless you want to dine on dog food and pay too much, no.
7.  - wines for BTC, can't figure out their prices or how they work. 90s called, want their website back.
8. Edit: Purse lets you buy things with other people's plastic, see (1).
Now then, where is it you shop for food?

Grateful for them failing? I suppose. Not that it makes much difference, miners simply wouldn't have upgraded to 0.13.1, there woulda been a bit more of a mess &amp; shouting, but with the same results.


More harmony than u can shake a stick at :)

[Like so](


For a country of 31 million people, 34BTC per day volume is nothing to brag about.  Compare with [92,975 BTC]( total daily volume (which does not include most Chinese exchanges or Localbitcoins).


The volume over the past couple of months has dropped, see chart.
@_date: 2016-12-15 16:27:19


Correct. Just as a CC extends the functionality of fiat. But a CC is not an investment, neither is LN.
Now, we can follow up: If a CC asked you to pay, a month in advance, for everything that you might buy, and charged you every time you used it, instead of paying you via cash back &amp; buyer protection, would Visa be more popular than it is today?
@_date: 2016-12-12 14:17:29
If Bitcoin market cap rises, attacking the network becomes more lucrative (like cracking a safe with $100k in it is more lucrative than cracking one with $1), So the hashrate (the lock) that was fine for guarding $1 is no longer sufficient for guarding $100k. 
TL;DR: if Bitcoin price goes up, hashrate (or, rather, expense of solving a block) must increase to maintain current level of security.
@_date: 2016-11-24 14:29:15
In other words, 


Unless I'm misreading you. What do you mean by "keeping all of bit coins unique value propositions" [if not that]?
@_date: 2016-12-09 16:24:37


Because AFAIK, no one has ever made money by "investing" in cloud mining; most cloud mining propositions turned out to be straight-up scams.


Rigs are no longer built. They're bought. The days of a milk crate with a rat's nest of cables and 4 GPUs are long gone.


The real issue for cloudmining is obvious, for home mining is profitability. It is much cheaper to buy gear wholesale and mine with subsidized/industrial rates electricity. If you don't mind losing money, then there are no issues.
