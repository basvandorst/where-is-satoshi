I grabbed it quick cause I was late and didn't even look. Good thing I noticed it when I went to double check before driving away.

That's actually the keys to our shed we have. You're welcome to come take our 3 year old Christmas junk :D

Nitrogensports and Betcoinsports are my two Bitcoin books I use almost everyday. Come check out and say hi.

I acknowledge this is the underlying reason behind it, I'm not holding my breath of a rise in value and I'm holding coin as well.

SAME... I wish I still had those...

Debt is hard to fathom in a system that does not allow for a fractional reserve system. Bitcoins decentralized and trustless environment for transactions make it hard to secure this debt in Bitcoin or US dollars alike. 
Malibu Bitcoin has been working to provide secured Bitcoin denominated loans. Should be coming along soon.
@_date: 2014-12-21 06:59:03
That's right. Two are being deployed ASAP, with more on the way.
@_date: 2014-12-17 03:47:35
Duly noted. I'll be a bit more careful with that next time. Thanks!

The day I can buy RyanAir tickets for 50% off is the day I can afford to travel the world.
@_date: 2014-12-21 11:55:06
Fees are on a race to zero, ATMs are lower than our personal brokerage service, that's what you see the 5% fee is for.
@_date: 2014-08-17 01:48:17
Sounds like what we do over at Malibu Bitcoin as well. I'd love to do some collaboration work.

From a entrepreneurs prospective, I think the vast majority of people who have heard of Bitcoin, but don't know anything about it, are turned away by the attitude and rhetoric of some of the startups in the industry.
Silicon Valley/Beach has always taken a very "holier than thou" tone when reaching its customers.
People need to have a friendly face to Bitcoin, a personal aspect of it. Someone to talk them through the ins and outs, set them up.
One of the reasons, and it has been directly told to me before, that Malibu Bitcoin has gained so much traction in the two months we've operated, is because we aren't trying to take a savior mentality to the streets like some of our colleagues are. 
We're just sharing a really cool idea  with them. We buy them coffee, we laugh, we talk about how it can work with them in the way their doing things now. Not shoving it down their throats.
Pardon the text wall and improper formating, my phones keyboard stifles my eloquence.

We have quite a few of our clients who have large holdings in VIA, our company ASIC's are mining away right now actually. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 08:53:15
OTC exchange would be best, otherwise you'd lose money on order book slippage. We operate a private OTC with Malibu Bitcoin and although we would dona transaction that large, the buyer would likely make money from us because of the savings from slippage in the open market.
@_date: 2014-12-23 23:26:03
But of course, the OG!
@_date: 2014-10-02 16:29:07
I'm having the opposite problem. I was charged twice for a 20USD deposit...
@_date: 2014-12-29 21:35:05
Word of mouth, tell people about it. Wear some Bitcoin gear, support local bitcoin accepting businesses.
@_date: 2014-08-13 07:23:25
We had to register. Our ATMs are only one-way and our legal advisor said we had too.

If you are looking into buying Bitcoin in Socal, I am co-founder of a cash, full service exchange startup operating out of Malibu, CA. We are Malibu Bitcoin. 
Expresscoin may be venture backed, but we can offer you a portable, secure and completely personal exchange expirence.
Also, Expresscoin if you could stop flagging our ads as spam on CL that would be greaaaat...

Our firm, Malibu Bitcoin, is a full service and private Bitcoin brokerage. We offer private local exchange, escrow, cold storage, speculation consultation and purchase agent services to clients in the greater Southern California area. We also have an education and outreach program that offers free set up, equipment and support for merchants who wish to accept Bitcoin. 
In regards to VIA, I think the work that the Dev's have put into solving the problems of the Blockchain not being built specifically for the services that are coming out. Sort of the "Blockchain 2.0". VIA as well as projects like Ethereum and Maidsafe, that create meaningful and potentially history altering changes in how business gets done are very important not only to me personally, but important in our firms goal.
We mine VIA and POT currently, VIA because of the innovations and its still a viable currency, and POT because it is an industry specific and serious altcoin for an industry that is on the verge of an exponential growth spurt.
TL:DR Malibu Bitcoin is a private Bitcoin Brokerage, VIA is cool because of its Blockchain enhancements and its viability as money.
Edit: Spelling, Mobile is difficult.
@_date: 2014-12-29 23:24:07
less than that of course. We charge those rates for in-person, cash exchanges. we'd put together something far more reasonable.
Edit: We'd also be more than happy to walk you through anything Bitcoin related as well, free of charge.
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:09:01
An OTC exchange would be best. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 23:06:12
An OTC exchange would be the best bet. The user that posted the Coindesk article is on track. Slippage is a real concern on an exchange of your moving a lot of capital. Now I hate to self-plug, but Malibu Bitcoin does just that. We operate as an OTC exchange and brokerage. Our clients get priced at the time of sale in one lump sum, not against a public order book.
@_date: 2014-12-21 18:02:28
Buy only for the time being, if we show traction all the remaining deployments will be bidirectional
@_date: 2014-10-26 21:13:14
It's like you're in a time machine...

Same happened with my bank account. Circle refunded it in two days.
@_date: 2014-08-12 18:43:51
Malibu Bitcoin does this, but we do this free of charge and In-Person. 
We've had a fantastic response as well.
@_date: 2014-12-28 22:42:26
Sounds like a cool idea, might be a bit heavy for general public, but more tech savvy people might grasp it.
@_date: 2014-10-14 06:39:03
I'm all about this. Let me know how I can help.
@_date: 2014-08-13 07:22:14
We've started to do this, sent our paperwork in for the BSA registration.
We're planning on launching our ATM network soon as well, which means more headaches for Malibu Bitcoin.
But we're here to stay, becoming legal doesn't mean we lose our spirit.
@_date: 2014-08-10 02:47:14
Someone who actually knew what to do with CC  wouldn't ha e told you that. It was either cops, or an incredibly stupid fraudster that would have gotten caught anyway.
Off question, how much volume do you do through LBC? Anything that could have given LE a reason to do a controlled buy? We also use LBC for Malibu Bitcoin and I am curious.
@_date: 2014-11-08 21:30:38
Malibu Bitcoin uses Bitwage, I can say its very simple and straight forward to use and I look forward to expanding using them as my payroll provider.
@_date: 2014-08-09 16:51:59
There was an ad in my local Craigslist trying to sell this exchange for half a million. I contacted the seller and we talked a bit, said he(or she) didn't have the capital to keep it going. 
Everything about it makes me uneasy.
@_date: 2014-12-19 18:54:25
Use an OTC exchange, we could help, malibubitcoin.com
@_date: 2014-11-29 19:10:27
If you'd still like to buy some Bitcoin, I'd love to help.
@_date: 2014-10-04 06:53:17
Its a form of tagging you can use to track spending of certain addresses, from my understanding. I've just got one of these tags in my personal wallet I've used for sometime now. 
@_date: 2014-12-21 11:54:01
Fees are on a race to zero, and we plan to make them as low as possible moving forward.
@_date: 2014-12-21 20:16:18
Not ideal! :( but it will be a start.
@_date: 2014-12-29 21:19:10
Malibubitcoin.com, we can help you with the OTC trading. I'll even drop your fees if you mention reddit.
Edit: I can spell I swear, mobile is hard.
@_date: 2014-12-05 20:30:56
You could reflash the firmware for it, that sounds troubling.
@_date: 2014-09-14 02:19:48
Malibu Bitcoin has some clients that wish for us to manage their funds for them. Much like a traditional brokerage. We baked it in to our services when we bootstraped the firm.

we've had limited success getting into the LA medical co-ops and clinics, but for an industry that is so uncertain and regulated they are understandably resistant to adopt more risk.
@_date: 2015-01-16 04:08:48
There are multiple ones on Lincoln Road Mall, which one specifically?
@_date: 2015-01-17 13:52:19
Try bitcoinatm360. They stock all of the models and habe some great back end services.
@_date: 2015-05-10 15:16:35
Not sure what that is.. Like withdrawing to a bank account? or sending Bitcoin denominated in USD?
@_date: 2016-03-09 07:49:57
I had a similar problem with buying CS:GO skins from my favorite site. Sent from my wallet and got confirmed but Coinbase for some reason did not process payments that did not originate from Coinbase (at least what was explained to me by a support staff)
Edit: It's fixed now for me, but it's not just humble Bundle

You'd be very hard pressed of find any place that would accept that much in credit cards for Bitcoin without flagging your accounts for fraud on either side. 
If you wanted to make sure that the taint between your purchases was very difficult to trace, You'd have to buy Bitcoin with cash and then send them through a mixing service or mix them yourself to a separate wallet that is independent from your other wallets.
From there you'd have to sell very slowly for cash from your new wallet or spend them directly over a long period of time.
However, someone who knew what they were looking for theoretically could spot the movements of similar amounts of Bitcoin on the blockchain and it MAY be possible for someone to trace it back to your initial credit purchase.
TL;DR: Very slowly, with high fees and a marginally high chance of being traced "Buying In" and Cashing Out"

Not where I'm at unfortunately, otherwise my S1's would have new life. Electricity prices doe.
@_date: 2015-11-15 18:08:44
Exactly. Lol
@_date: 2015-11-15 17:43:42
Technically no, But since it's operating unregulated anyways It's not a problem for access.
