Remember when 10k was the bottom...good times
@_date: 2018-09-20 19:11:54
Btc will die probably. If people have no money/no jobs, who is going to buy bitcoin? It will be the real crash to $100. And even if people did have cash saved, they would rather buy “cheap” stocks than crypto that has already failed during stock bull market.
@_date: 2018-09-11 18:10:17
Is Bill Gates getting rid of his cash then?
@_date: 2018-09-13 21:52:07
Should’ve bought her wooden ring and 1 btc instead
@_date: 2018-09-13 19:47:11
Old meme
@_date: 2018-09-20 16:04:19
Roger will say it’s bcash
@_date: 2018-09-13 00:29:25
It will be the same excuses as his “unhackable” wallet. If you trust anything Mcafee says, you’re extremely gullible. You know the serpent in the Bible? That was Mcafee.
@_date: 2018-09-13 13:40:15
It means you should probably start buying shitcoins if you want maximum gains
@_date: 2018-09-12 19:14:01
Can’t wait to check the price 1 year from now, and see it drop to 1k
@_date: 2018-09-12 21:20:07
No they arent. You’re thinking Titan
@_date: 2018-09-13 00:42:21


@_date: 2018-09-14 20:01:50
At 65 its no longer bitcoin, its bitconnect 2
@_date: 2018-09-11 20:02:28
It will soon shed enough value to fit into the bin with all the other shitcoins. Face it, crypto is a failure, and it’s all going to 0.
@_date: 2018-08-15 20:45:49
What about the accumulate memes
@_date: 2018-08-30 18:00:09
My breaking point is $0, i will only sell then.
@_date: 2018-08-23 21:54:06
I’m of the same opinion, we could be wrong though, a lot of alts can just die off without recovering.
@_date: 2018-08-31 20:15:09
Thats weak...
@_date: 2018-10-12 17:00:41
The difference is 401k is up for everyone, bitcoin is up for a few %
@_date: 2018-10-25 13:41:54
That’s not a good thing when the price is stuck at $6500...
@_date: 2018-10-24 20:33:06
Didn’t he predict 50k a few months ago? A month from now his prediction will drop to 10k
@_date: 2018-10-02 19:55:01
5k is more likely
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:23:37
the bottom is never the bottom
@_date: 2018-10-30 07:50:25
Any news results in a dump
@_date: 2018-10-30 07:52:37
What bull run? The bulls are extinct.
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:23:33
It’s a long running scam orchestrated by China to steal usd obviously
@_date: 2018-10-16 16:19:36
Thats what they said one year ago
@_date: 2018-10-16 16:32:26
Positive news has no effect on the price, while negative news tanks it. The future isn’t looking great.
@_date: 2018-10-19 20:38:49
Lmao, 6 years is an eternity in crypto
@_date: 2018-10-04 17:23:39
So we’ll never reach ATH again? 
@_date: 2018-10-11 19:16:04
We will never see 6500 again lol
@_date: 2018-10-02 20:06:39
2021 is when we finally hit 3k
@_date: 2018-10-20 23:52:04
Crypto apologists have the same shit arguments.
@_date: 2018-10-24 19:06:43
You have to short before
@_date: 2018-10-06 08:51:36
One can dream, it’s more likely to be $5
@_date: 2018-10-30 20:56:50
I predict -5%
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:32:43
I sold at 6k so that I can buy back at 50k!
@_date: 2018-10-17 15:51:23
Lmao, how is that good for a highly speculative asset? We aren’t here for 19% gains, you can get that with regular stocks. We are here for 1000%+ gains, and btc failed to deliver this year.
@_date: 2018-10-17 15:10:25
@_date: 2018-10-20 05:45:35
Because it’s not a quote
@_date: 2018-10-30 20:53:58
That’s bad news...for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-10-21 22:03:41
Ride down
@_date: 2018-10-02 13:36:30
There were bitcoin memes then?
@_date: 2018-10-26 05:07:06
Btc is the best stablecoin. Who needs tether and all the other shit
@_date: 2018-10-25 20:05:10
Nope. We follow the “buy high, sell low” strategy here.
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:26:43
You mean the faster this scam will end
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:42:36
I think it will only get worse..better stock up on whisky, depressing times ahead.
@_date: 2018-11-02 16:55:29
@_date: 2018-11-26 12:24:36
When I saw this post, I haven't checked the price yet. I thought we had a 50% rebound... it's only 10%. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 19:00:03
Im thinking of deleting everything..including my life
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:38:18
The real bottom is sub-1k
@_date: 2018-11-24 06:46:43
I predict mass suicides in 2019
@_date: 2018-11-24 06:32:13
Its a fake. They swapped the 250lbs whale for her
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:44:52
Yea $0
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:40:07
300 will the the new 300 soon
@_date: 2018-11-09 20:56:09
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:04:08
Past performance etc.
@_date: 2018-11-05 17:01:35
For me its a lot harder..I used to use credit card and interac to transfer money to exchange. Both of my banks are currently blocking it.
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:50:53
...because I wasn’t selling
@_date: 2018-11-08 15:04:14
The only use case for bitcoin? Lol
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:58:44
I set my limit orders at $0
@_date: 2018-11-07 18:34:35
If all those assets crash, what do you think will happen to bitcoin or crypto in general? That’s right, it will cease to exist
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:44:23
You can get infinity at $0
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:24:38
Warren Buffett called btc rat poison several times. You think his advice applies here? Lmao
@_date: 2018-11-05 18:22:55
Banks will never be the second face, sorry to say
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:26:10
When $0
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:47:33
Bro, if it goes to 3k its dead. Doubt you will be buying anything. Remember bitconnect? Were you buying at $1? Didnt think so
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:23:10
It wasn’t 
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:05:08
What reason would it have to ever jump?
@_date: 2018-11-02 18:06:44
Lmao what profits
@_date: 2018-11-24 06:32:44
Spoken like a true bagholder
@_date: 2018-11-24 06:34:37
“True bagholders are in it until they take their life” FTFY
@_date: 2018-11-23 20:49:55
Yea back then bitcoin was an obscure and relatively unknown phenomenon
@_date: 2018-11-07 22:14:17
Yea 2% up = mooning nowadays
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:48:08
You lll be able to buy 100 full bitcoins soon
@_date: 2018-11-02 16:55:39
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:48:27
Everyone will be a nocoiner in 5 years.
@_date: 2018-11-11 09:40:59
I believe him. He can see the future
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:49:47
Fiat is decreasing in value at a relatively stable very slow rate. Bitcoin is decreasing in value at an insane rate.
@_date: 2018-11-21 22:50:52
Spent 3 hours analyzing this. I can conclude with absolute certainty that $0 is the bottom.
@_date: 2018-11-24 06:30:50
Tons of bagholders about to lose the little money they have. The rich will get richer, the plebs will pleb.
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:39:42
30k end of 2018 or I’ll eat McAfee’s balls!
@_date: 2018-11-02 16:56:04
Nope, get out while its still worth something
@_date: 2018-11-24 06:33:55
Fake stats
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:45:11
Posts like this is why cryptosphere is considered a big joke
@_date: 2018-11-02 18:07:49
Prediction: $4000 end of Dec
@_date: 2018-11-26 07:25:49
Lol you don't know the real bottom
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:56:47
...not because anyone is interested in buying, but because people wanna laugh at all the fools who did
@_date: 2018-11-08 18:07:42
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:04:00
Keep dreaming. If it drops to &lt;$1000, it's dropping all the way to $0, I can guarantee that.
@_date: 2018-11-23 20:42:41
The previous times werent as bad as this time
@_date: 2018-11-05 19:26:14
Isn’t android like bcash?
@_date: 2018-11-24 18:12:53
Then you should not have invested. If you think you need that money to pay bills, do not invest in anything.
@_date: 2018-11-16 18:11:51
You need to stop calling banks scams. Crypto is much more of a scam than banks right now, also no one will take you seriously except the small reddit circlejerk
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:48:50
The bottom is $0, not 3.7k
@_date: 2018-11-08 23:12:59
For the 100th time? Are they banning it tomorrow?
@_date: 2018-11-13 01:18:59
This is more likely
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:05:47
But why? Do you actually believe in it? I mean at this point it looks like it’s all over and you’re just burning your money
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:46:21
It’ll be worth 5 btc tomorrow
@_date: 2018-11-06 07:07:28
Didnt Novoshill “predict” new ath this year and then retracted?
