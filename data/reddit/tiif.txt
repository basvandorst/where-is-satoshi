Slowly grasping it thanks to you guys. If i wait then i would have to wait until 1 transaction method will be universal? Nobody knows how long there would be 2 Bitcoins? That github thing makes it so i have my purchased bitcoins in my own wallet on my computer which would mean i cant do anything with them on the market as long as im not pushing them to a broker again?

So if DO end up having both, there would be 2 seperate Bitcoin markets because transaction speeda would differ?

So lets say i have my bitcoins in my wallet on my phone. How would i determine which market those coins would be going on 1st of Aug? By choosing the broker that either supports legacy or BIP148? And what wallets are you recommending? Also if i don't put coins into a wallet and make no deals then the broker would transfer them into the new adapted system (hopefully UASF one) themselves?

I know it's using BTC-e rates.
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:24:25
Why those wallets specifically?

What the fuck is blockchain? I'm rookie motherfucker.:C

What do you mean by owning the keys? Having them in my computer wallet?

That makes me feel so much better. Thank you. I still want to understand the idea tho. Aren't you worried about the future of Bitcoin? Finger on the trigger, ready to sell in the beginning of august? 
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:03:08
How can there be such a divide on those big levels with one side not seeing the future? I can't really phrase my question right. I mean their vision has to have an outcome supported by data and facts as well right, so how come they cannot see that their way would have no future? Are the somewhag aware of it, but want to control the direction of bitcoin?

Thanks, i'm understanding it better already i think. So both sides believe that their way of making transactions is for the better of Bitcoin in general? I mean isn't there kind of certain mathematically predicted outcome for both scenarios? Can't the top analyst say thay "this" is utter shit and support it with pure logic and reasoning or is it kind of wait-and-see situation? Or are the top analysts paid by someone to support the idea?
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:55:54
Right now i'm doing deals through plus500 app which goes through BTC-e and thats not on the   list. Is the app for wallet completely different to broker? 
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:07:04
Care to elaborate?

Thanks for the tips, i've read most of the tops posts about the subject, but it's kind of like solving math equations back in school when you don't fundamentally understand the concept. I can do all that the guides tell me and set up the stuff, but i wouldnt have any clue why i am doing it. I guess ill try reading even more. Right now all these "nodes" and "Coin cores" and "coin chains" sound like Martian language. I guess i need ELI2 instead of ELI5, but if you have to put it as simply as possible, what is the Aug 1st about? Get more money? Get more people? Diversity?
I probably sound like i have no fucking idea what's going on in the cryptocurrency market, but it's only because it's true.
