Buying now will be a big mistake it is soaring at an ATH. A big dip is expected.

Umm okay but Internet came to our town in 2013 and I bought my first computer in 2015, it would have been someone else with my username that you saw on reddit in 2010-2011 my friend!

I was absolutely sure and was going to buy at $1400 and a few moments before I was going to make the transactions I got some bad news and then that led to bankruptcy. 
I don't have any cryptos now but I wish I did, I might jump in for a $100 or $50 soon. Just so I can be part of it. You made a good decision and bought at 3800! HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:37:47
Sad to hear that man and glad you made it through! I am also planning on buying in a $100 now and then adding in little amount every week!

Thank you very much! I will send you a PM to remind myself. Your help will be very useful and beneficial to me. 
And yes of course, if you ever land on my part of the Earth I will be more than happy to show you around!! 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:49:30
Hey man, thanks a ton! I really really appreciate your offer, although I will not be taking the HW, because I don't like to take from people hard earned money without giving anything in return, but I wan't to tell you, this really made me happy. Wish you best luck and happy hodlings!

to me it feels like buying small chicks, waiting for them to grow and then just cutting them and making nuggets out of them

@_date: 2017-10-12 13:00:54
Thats a good option! Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:38:00
A $100 wont be as profitable,right? Even if it gets doubled its still a $200 lmao. Ill still invest though. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:52:25
When everyone is buying its time to sell. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:24:36

@_date: 2017-10-12 12:17:15
As a student, thats all I have! Can I ask a question? I am just reading it touched 5000, last time I was almost ready to buy it, it was at 2000. Should I buy it at 5000 or wait for it to come down as it is very unstable? 
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:16:03
Ohh! That makes so much sense!! Thanks Ill consider this aswell
