don't forget option 3. Admit that the price can crash further and sell some of your coins.

On the other side, this isn't the first panic sell from the 1200 dollar top last year and you would have been better off now if you had sold at the *bottom of every one of these crashes*.
Also the whole bear whale slaying  looks incredible retarded, too, now. As does recommending to not sell any coins because you don't want the price to fall further.

I wouldn't call it a ponzi scheme. It does have some *ponzi-esque qualities* tough: first adopters could earn an immense wealth just by mining a few coins back in the day. Newcomes have to be introduced into the system so that the price rises. Satoshi had to draw people in to get the ball started; he remained anonymous and if he cashes out driving prices down to single digits you certainly would feel ripped of. I still wouldn't call it an obvious and intentional ponzi scheme, as nobody promised you great returns. And bitcoin doesn't have zero utility, at the very least you can still buy drugs and porn with it.
On the other hand, it certainly has similar qualities to **pump and dump schemes** in penny stocks and that fits very well to our decemeber bubble last year. Bitcoin got hyped up with silly arguments and moon talk until the bubble run out of fuel (= new people), with a big amount of coins dumped into an overvalued market.
Ultimately, I think it is more apt to call it a **crypto scheme**. And that is what you can clearly see in most altcoins: start a new coin with promising feature X, draw as much people in as possible, pump up the price by hyping it up in forums and sell overpriced digital tokens to a bunch of bagholders.
The question you have to ask yourself: is bitcoin that much different from all those other coins?

The plagiarism was created in the hopes of eliciting critical thinking. Think about it, the same nonsense text works verbatim in r/litecoin and r/bitcoin. But oh well, feel flattered.

Shorting bitcoin wasn't all that unwise throughout 2014. And probably still is, but we could soon be in a short-bubble.

"It'll pass $55 one day", "Its a sure thing", "Stupid people selling it that cheap", ... 
r/litecoin is probably the most deluded altcoin community and currently just a bunch of bag holders. Lets wait a couple of months and see. Nobody can predict the future, but seeing $55 litecoins is relative unlikely at this point. At least for the foreseeable future.

The username doublec rings a bell. Didn't he create the first (albeit very crappy) altcoin exchange? (Namecoin&lt;-&gt;Bitcoin)

Yep and this month just started. I'd bet that we see another drop below 200 soon.
