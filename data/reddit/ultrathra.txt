If actual Segwit addresses start with "bc1", then how did "3" addresses come to be associated with Segwit?

Don't *keep* your coin on exchanges. You can move it there if you want to sell.

I dunno, do you at least know the TXID?

I was just thinking this. If you close your account you don't have any proof. Is there an easy way to export all account history?

If you buy a coffee with on-chain BTC, you're asking the network to store that 300-byte transaction to almost 10,000 nodes permanently. That's the part that's not scalable. We're doing around 3 on-chain transactions a second but Visa supports up to 24,000 per second at its absolute max. If Bitcoin just made blocks big enough to hold all that, that's over 4.8MB/s of just downloading the chain. Lots of Bitcoin node runners don't have that kind of internet connection, much less the storage space for all that. We want regular people to run nodes and still allow bitcoin to support a fuckhuge network with a fuckhuge number of transactions. So Bitcoin uses LN to do transactions off-chain, as a second layer, that groups transactions together so that on-chain only stores the net result of many payments.

So it's just another Y2K-type thing?

Nobody owns any BTC because nobody can get Gemini or Coinbase to verify them. It's one gigantic inside joke.

Note to readers: He's talking about Electrum for desktop computers. The Android version is super buggy. I was able to crash it within 2 minutes of starting up.

I understand there is no visible overlap, as an overlap results in an exchange. But why are the two halves of the graph so far apart in this image?

I never thought I'd get more pissed at Gawker than I already am.
I can understand having an opinion on crypto but this guy takes it to a whole other level. A tiny fraction of the article is about BTC going up, the rest is spent on this baseless personal tirade. I say personal, because echoing a commenter, nobody who hasn't lost something in crypto writes fuming, seething articles like this. Not a single sentence in this article is solely factual without being infected by his personal bias. Then he spends the rest of his working day flaming dissenters in *his own* comments section. Dude needs to chill out and quit insulting what is likely a sizable portion of their readership. This is somehow worthy of being tagged News section rather than Opinion.
What's his endgame? Did Andreas Antonopoulos run over his dog or what?
