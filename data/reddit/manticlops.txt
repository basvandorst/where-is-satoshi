Remember that trustlessness is the whole point? Running a bitcoin node right now takes ~300GB a month. I have better-than-average internet at home now, but until about November last year I had to run a node in my office - the best internet I could buy at home was insufficient.
Bcash's approach to scaling removes the ability of ordinary users to run their own nodes. Without the ability to run your own node, you no longer have a trustless system, and as before, the whole blockchain structure becomes a pointless encumbrance - a sham useful for marketing, but which otherwise brings only downsides.
As soon as a censor wishes to affect the bcash system, they need only kick in the doors of the dozen or so datacentres capable of hosting the software. Because the bandwidth required for bcash nodes (if it had any users) would necessarily mean the verification function has to centralise into a few locations.
And you can't do that to bitcoin, because we have refused to compromise in that regard.
@_date: 2019-07-02 13:09:06
The real purpose of Bitcoin is to remove from governments the responsibility for, and control of, money.
Reasons for this include that it's not *necessary* for governments to control money, and that they have serially &amp; invariably abused the powers they have with regard to money, to the detriment of the public good.
Bitcoin is just humans realising that there's a safer, fairer, more useful way to do money.

Nah, no confusion on my end, you just half-understand what you're talking about, with predictable results.
Mining profits are supposed to tend towards the marginal, and bitcoin is supposed to pay for its security through transaction fees (the issuance phase being temporary). Since the amount of security we need is proportionate to the value of that which we are securing, it all comes down to a simple question each user must answer for themselves - do the benefits bitcoin brings justify the fees necessary to keep it secure?
@_date: 2019-07-03 11:15:54
Trezors are great, so are ColdCard. They are the top two options.
Ledger have nice hardware, but are closed-source so kinda antithetical to bitcoin's ethos of trust minimisation.
@_date: 2019-07-22 13:41:47


Your misunderstanding of bitcoin's value proposition may be that, but it doesn't change the reality.


It's not that you needn't worry about a reorg, it's that your transaction fee no longer acts as an incentive for it to happen. It's nothing like checkpoints, which are just a comical undermining of the principles behind Nakamoto consensus.
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:43:02
Lightning is just one of what will eventually be many different structures built atop bitcoin. It is a real product for sure, but kinda also a proof of concept for what will eventually be possible. Which is to say it's very basic - think of the difference between a single transistor, and a motherboard.
LN shows the basic building block, but people will craft unimaginable structures using it.
@_date: 2019-07-22 18:48:23
The whole point about bitcoin - the *sine qua non* - is that it is censor-resistant. It's why we tolerate the otherwise awful blockchain architecture, which is slow &amp; massively inefficient. If we didn't need censor-resistance, we could just run bitcoin on AWS and have millions of instantly confirming transactions per second.
Bcash removes certain of the mechanisms through which censor-resistance is achieved, destroying the whole idea behind bitcoin, but (and this part is wonderfully stupid) it *retains* the awful blockchain, meaning it's still got the downsides, but lost the one upside.
It just doesn't make any sense.
Additionally, since any dev with a brain knows this, nobody good will work on their new features, with predictably hilarious results.

You're absolutely right. Governments could fork bitcoin &amp; attempt to outlaw the legacy rules. There are a few things which help prevent this though:
* Education of the userbase.
* The rational self-interest of certain individuals (politicians and similar) with bitcoin of their own.
* The inherently fragmentary nature of geopolitics.
* The existence of certain countries (Switzerland comes to mind) with a history of protecting private property rights.
* The game-theoretical incentives - a sort of high-level prisoner's dilemma - for countries/entities to break rank &amp; profit from undermining any attempted attack.
Governments, particularly democratic ones, are full of opportunists focused on the shortest time horizons, and generally lack the cojones to chose hard paths when easy ones are available.
The war on drugs has been underway for many decades, and you know how effective that has been. It is now seen as a costly, damaging folly, on a par with alcohol prohibition in the US in terms of the international criminal networks it has spawned. A war on Bitcoin is a much harder sell.

I don't think it's very likely that bitcoin will become 'earth credits', in use everywhere for everything. Much more likely that it will become the leading sound money, and that (considering the implications that flow from the existence of a universally accessible sound money) is enough.
We are used to deriding the idea of government-controlled monetary policy on this forum, and that's fair - it is almost universally abused. But a hypothetical well-run fiat currency is more beneficial for a country than something entirely inflexible like bitcoin. It's my contention that such a currency might be much less hypothetical in a post-bitcoin world.
Bitcoin just introduces a minimum standard, below which governments must not allow their fiat to slip. They're free though to do better - to trim their monetary sails perfectly to catch the prevailing economic winds, and smooth-out the impacts of cyclical trends.

We're not talking about memory - This is what you need to send/receive over your internet connection.
Visa can handle 80k tx/s. Now that's just one company, with a small fraction of the global transaction total.
If the average bcash transaction is 220 bytes, then to match Visa blocks would be over 10GB every 10 minutes, and monthly bandwidth maybe 3 petabytes. Sure our capacities are growing, but they seem unlikely to cope with that shit any time soon.
But we don't want to simply match Visa. We want to be able to cope with all the world's payments, plus new use-cases like pay-per-click browsing &amp; per-second real time billing for services.
Bitcoin has a plan to enable all this, while retaining the small footprint. Bcash is just nonsense.

I'm not fully up to date on bcash, but I think you should be able to use the private key for the bitcoin address in a bcash wallet &amp; recover the bcash that way.
Obviously depends on getting your hands on that private key (or persuading its owner to help).
Worth knowing - bcash creators introduced this problem deliberately, in the face of many warnings that this would happen. Why would you use a system designed to scam yourself like this?

The easier protocol changes are to make, the lower the security. This is a feature with bitcoin, not a bug. Other coins' relative ease of change results from few people caring about them one way or the other.
Bitcoin certainly needs improvements in privacy terms in my opinion, but there's a good reason we haven't gone there yet - the necessary tech has not yet been shown to exist. Dash is a centralised &amp; non-private sham, Monero's solution doesn't scale, ZK-snarks/etc. are too new to be able to claim anything about their promise with confidence, and stuff like mimblewimble is (imho) weaksauce, a partial solution with a distinct dead-end vibe.

There are several misunderstandings here, so it's hard to know where to begin.
Miners will ignore the last 6 blocks because your double spend has a giant fee - is that the idea? Because that doesn't work. Most miners rationally follow the original chain, out of fear that the new chain's block rewards would be valueless. No nodes would accept the new chain's blocks.
@_date: 2019-07-21 13:09:51
Miners don't verify transactions, they just put them in order.

Eventually, to prove bitcoiners wrong, I did a deep-dive into the inner workings looking for the flaw that would confirm my opinion. Once I understood what was going on, I jumped in.
My advice is: Stay away from altcoins, they are all varying degrees of scam. Do not day trade - it's not a question of skill, but the size of your stack - you *will* lose money. Never expose your private keys to an everyday computing environment - get a hardware wallet. Never tell anyone about your investment (except maybe for estate planning purposes).

Confirmations in Bitcoin are not fixed in stone. The network will build on whichever valid block has the most PoW behind it.
Fee sniping is a miner trying to reorg the chain so that it can claim transaction fees from previous blocks, so can only happen *after* the transaction confirms.

From my knowledge, Bitcoin will provide the impetus for a civilisation-level refactoring of the global economy. Our current model is optimised for resource usage precisely because nobody wants to hold onto a money whose value drops continually by design.
Warmongering states looking to deploy planet-killing forces across the globe do so by being able to print their own money, making citizens pay via the back door. Post-hyperbitcoinization, real money will be required for this sort of endevour, meaning citizens will have to be persuaded of the wisdom of every single military operation.
If you haven't thought through the consequences of bitcoin, I can understand how it just seems like a pointless diversion of energy. But the opposite is true - there is no single thing we can do that would be better for the environment than to transition to hard money.

Blockchains don't make *any* sense if their primary purpose is not the transmission/storage/etc. of a native, value-bearing token (i.e. bitcoin). Their security model demands it.

Bitcoin's price volatility is not inexplicable, and extends over time periods such that 'difference in time zones' makes no sense as an explanation.
It's a new class of asset, with a huge public profile but a relatively tiny size compared with other asset types. The supply is limited in a way no other asset achieves. These facts are an obvious recipe for volatility. As bitcoin grows to include more &amp; more of the world's economy, it will become progressively less volatile. If it manages to become a global currency, it will be the least volatile asset that has ever existed.

These aren't really accurate terms, the blockchain is just a record of which keys unlock which bitcoin. Bitcoin don't 'sit' anywhere. If I send 1BTC to you, I'm really just recording that my key which used to unlock that bitcoin no longer works, and your key does instead.
Think of LN as a bunch of transactions which are sent between private key holders, but are *not* sent to the network for incorporation in a block.
Any participant, at any time, can hit the button that sends the transactions onto the blockchain. So you have that security, without actually having to commit anything to the blockchain until it becomes necessary.

Governments are able to confiscate bitcoin (or imprison the owner indefinitely). Don't kid yourself.


Bitcoin potentially stops governments (of all hues) from 'successfully' printing money. This doesn't mean the end of governments, and is not contingent on that government's ideological foundations.

Electrum on tails is a fantastic way to store your bitcoin, because of how safe it is. That safety comes at the expense of useability.
If you're buying from an ATM, you might make life easier for yourself by sending the purchase to a phone wallet (e.g. Samourai) which will make the whole QR code part much easier.
Once you have the bitcoin on your phone, send a low-fee transaction to your Tails/electrum wallet (you could email the address to yourself, or type it in manually).
All the addresses you see in the receive tab are pre-generated ones, derived from your seed words.

First of all, they broke the golden rule of cryptography - never roll your own encryption. It's very, very, very hard and totally unnecessary. Everyone knows this, and those who break the rule might as well festoon themselves with red flags &amp; paint targets on their backs.
Inevitably, some security researchers found a bad vulnerability (everyone's money was trivial to steal, lol), and contacted the devs privately. The devs sat on the problem, refusing to fix it. So the researchers went public, whereupon the devs claimed the mistake was inserted deliberately, to undermine anyone stealing their code (lol again).
Just one of many hilarious incidents IOTA has brought to the world so far. It won't be the last (there's more problems to come, but I am not the one to tell the world about them).

Initially, channels will open just as if it was a normal transaction (and it *is* a transaction - perhaps you haven't understood this?). The only difference is that, whereas a normal transaction would then be done and dusted, the opened LN channel can facilitate many subsequent transactions.
Soon, you don't even need to open a new channel, since a route can be found using already-open channels.
The question is, 'why would you make a one-off transaction, when you could instead open a LN channel?'

I think much of the current price gain is from people trying to get rich quick, who don't understand Bitcoin's potential, and who will bail at the first sign of trouble. I also think it's very undervalued.
So it depends how you define a bubble. If the only requirement is that there must be a dramatic fall from the current price, then it's likely in a bubble. But if the overall trend is up, regardless of short-term sawtooth action, then I don't think bubble is the correct term.

There's too much misunderstanding in your mental model of how LN works. It's literally just a way to avoid putting tx on the chain, by summing them and only recording the net effect of a bunch of them.
Anyone involved can, at any time, publish to the blockchain. Until that happens, it's just a clever way to avoid having to pay a mining fee for every little payment.

Sure, you just need an address from the Electrum wallet to use in the transaction. Basically-
* Boot into TailsOS (a secure version of linux designed for exactly this sort of situation).
* Open Electrum, make a new wallet, write down the seed phrase &amp; copy an address to a USB stick or similar.
* Close TailsOS &amp; visit Coinbase to send the Bitcoin to the address you just made.
* Write words in card.
It takes a bit of getting used to - the seed words are the only representation of the wallet in existence - but it's in the same ballpark as hardware wallets, security-wise, for free.
(edit to add: I forgot to mention, Tails is designed to boot from a usb stick, or dvd-r or whatever. You don't need to format an HDD or anything like that. It's pretty cool, the sort of thing everyone should know about imho).

Hey, sorry for the slow reply, working &amp; travelling right now. 
Addresses are derived from public keys, which are in turn derived from private keys (at least in the algorithm Bitcoin uses).


Not quite- Recipients already have the private key (or they aren't recipients!). They hash the public key ([see this diagram]( to get the address, which they then disclose to whoever is sending them bitcoin.

The entire point of bitcoin is censorship resistance. Unstoppable money.

Nearly all 'small blockers' believe that bitcoin will one day have larger blocks. The point is, we will only go along with an increase when it's both **safe** and **necessary**.
Right now it's not safe (if blocks were much bigger, bandwidth requirements would push bitcoin - ie node operation - out of most people's reach), nor is it necessary (fees are low, and we need a fee market to develop prior to the block reward's effective disappearance).
So nothing against big blocks in principle, they're just not appropriate yet. This position is regarded as fairly axiomatic here, so the dozens of posts a day from those who disagree are/would be removed just to keep the place tidy.

Since a 'lightning transaction posted to the blockchain' might represent hundreds of individual transactions, you have to divide the fee between them to get a true picture.
Compared to a non-lightning situation, you'll pay much less. This is kinda the point- we need on-chain tx to pay high fees for security, especially when the block reward becomes small. LN provides a way to get hundreds of tx in return for you on-chain fees.

There are 2^256 possible public keys, each with a corresponding private key. They are one-to-one.
An address is the result of a series of hashing operations performed on the public portion of such a keypair, using both SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 in various ways (plus the addition of a version byte and a checksum).
The use of RIPEMD-160 reduces the address space to 2^160, meaning that there are ~2^96 keypairs for each address (only an average, but there's no reason to assume any one address will deviate far from this number). If 2 people independently generate keypairs which result in the same address (a so-called 'collision'), they would both have access to the funds associated with it. 
One of the many clever aspects of Bitcoin's design is that finding such a collision is not just very difficult, but anyone with the capability to try is strongly incentivised to instead turn their computers to the task of mining blocks.
This will not always be the case, however. At some point (years away), SHA-256 will be considered vulnerable to collision-generation and we'll need to fork in a different algorithm.

I think there are some misapprehensions around how bitcoin functions that are leading you astray.
Miners are allowed to choose which transactions they include in a block. The assumption is they'll pretty much pick as many of the highest-fee tx from the mempool as they can fit in a block, but there are no obligations in this regard. So you could close a LN channel after a million LN tx, and pay essentially nothing. 
It comes down to this- if you are going to pay for block space, do you want that payment to cover many tx, or one? The choice is obvious.

To be easy to use, addresses need a more concise format than SHA-256 produces (while still possessing sufficient uniqueness!).
Satoshi chose to additionally employ the RIPEMD-160 hashing algorithm to generate addresses, which gives a shorter hash output. The combination of two unrelated algorithms also potentially affords a degree of protection against undiscovered weaknesses in either.
Keys are longer than addresses - for each address there are an average of 2^96 public keys. I try not to think too hard about it :)
@_date: 2018-09-17 13:08:51
The smaller number is the address space, the larger is the private key space (so yes, each address has many possible private keys).

As part of your answer to your relative you should make clear that while BTC are capped at 21 million, the smallest subdivision (a satoshi) can be made much smaller.
So while one BTC is currently divisible into 100 million 'pieces', it would be the work of moments, relatively, to make the smallest subdivision orders of magnitude smaller.
(I don't know if this is relevant, but I've met a few people who hear the number 21 million and assume that there won't be enough internet money to go around)

Miners would mine the block anyway, knowing that more tx (+ fees) will be along shortly, for inclusion in the next block.
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:32:55


To my mind, to truly be a currency, a coin has to be very widely held/used/accepted. Bitcoin is still under 1% adoption. Sure, you can spend it places, I do it all the time, but that's not what most people mean by 'currency'. Right now, Bitcoin is behaving more like a commodity.
Much of the recent price rise is speculative for sure, but let's break that down. There are some who are literally just looking to make a quick buck. There are others who are also speculating, but who do so on the basis of future use-cases rather than the present-day value swings. Then there are people who are buying it to use today. I believe the latter are in the minority, and acknowledge that worries some people.
As adoption increases, Bitcoin will transition from speculative commodity to 'true' currency. This will bring down volatility (the trend has already been headed downwards for years), as 'real' usage begins to underpin valuation. In fact, I believe it's certain that Bitcoin will one day be the least volatile of all assets, as it will be the most widespread &amp; diverse asset, touching every aspect of every economy globally.
Mining is the process of adding new blocks to the blockchain, extending it one block at a time. Thousands of computers compete to solve a problem by trial and error. Each block contains a list of new transactions, though it's not obligatory for a miner to include these (by mining an empty block, they miss out on potential transaction fee income). Each block rewards the miner who found it with a 'block reward'- 'new' bitcoin are created by the protocol &amp; sent to the winning miner's address. The block reward was originally 50 BTC, but halves every four years, and is presently 12.5 BTC. This halving is intended broadly to mimic the way a resource (e.g. gold) is mined from the earth - easy pickings to begin with, tailing off to more meagre rewards as time goes on.

You should be able to select 'edit fees manually' or similar in preferences? Fee estimation seems to be a hard thing for wallets to get right.
Assuming your transaction has a low number of inputs (it probably does), a fee of 0.0003 will probably confirm within an hour. 0.0001 should be good for over night.

Omidyar. Everything he does seems weirdly misanthropic for a self-proclaimed philanthropist. From [Pando.com](
10 Things Every Fearless Adversarial Investigative Reporter Should Know About Pierre Omidyar
    1. Pierre Omidyar, his wife, and his top Omidyar Network director have logged in over a dozen visits to the Obama White House to visit senior officials and members of Obama’s National Security Council.
    2. Between 2011-2013, Omidyar Network co-funded with USAID regime-change groups in Ukraine that organized the 2014 Maidan revolution. In India, the head of Omidyar Network’s operation, Jayant Sinha, concurrently worked for the far-right BJP Party leader Narendra Modi helping him take power in 2014, after which Modi appointed the Omidyar Network partner as his junior finance minister.
    3. Pierre Omidyar is a free-market libertarian loon who told Nobel Prize winner Mohammed Younus he refused to donate to the poor unless he could personally profit off of it. A few years later, hundreds of poor rural Indians committed suicide to avoid debt collectors working for one of Omidyar's for-profit microfinance lenders.
    4. Omidyar is the chairman of eBay/PayPal, which boasts of its own private global police force that works “hand in glove with law enforcement agencies," including the DEA, to whom eBay provides user data “on a silver platter” without subpoenas. Omidyar's eBay executives boast of arranging thousands of arrests around the world.
    5. Although Omidyar allegedly does not interfere in his journalists’ editorial, he does control all hiring and firing, budgets, approval of expenses for taxi rides and cocktails, snuffed months worth of investigative stories from leading investigative journalists, forces editorial staff to attend countless meetings, imposes task-management software on editorial, and “writes more internal messaging than anyone else.” But he does not interfere in editorial.
    6. Omidyar believes that journalists should help police arrest sources who leak stolen information from private for-profit companies. Omidyar supported the persecution of the PayPal 14 because he believes that free speech rights should be subordinate to the rights of private enterprise’s mission to maximize profits for shareholders.
    7. Omidyar is a committed prepper whose fear of pandemics and epidemics is so great, he has invested large sums into ensuring his own personal food supply, and has buried several months’ worth of food in storage facilities in properties around the world, from Hawaii to Montana, Nevada, and an island off the coast of France. Omidyar keeps a private French jet, and pays a private security detail made up of former Secret Service and State Department officials to help him survive his apocalyptic fantasies.
    8. In 2007, Omidyar invested in Maui Land &amp; Pineapple, which was subsequently accused of being part of the largest human trafficking operation ever busted by US federal officials.
    9. Omidyar loved Second Life so much he invested in Linden Lab and communicated with its CEO through his Second Life character, “Kitto Mandala,” a tattooed black man who rode a Segway and wore a T-shirt that read “KISS ME I’M LAWFUL EVIL.”
    10. Omidyar was investigated by Congress and sued for secretly “spinning stocks” — insider trading on IPOs — with Goldman Sachs. Omidyar was also accused by Craigslist and a Delaware judge of stealing the "secret sauce of Craigslist's success” and passing those secrets to eBay in violation of contracts, fiduciary duties and securities laws.
    Bonus: Pierre Omidyar arranged an interview with two “fiercely independent” journalists on Omidyar’s payroll at The Intercept, in which he revealed to them what tea he drinks in the morning. When asked to list his daily reading habits, The Intercept came in at number five, lower down on his reading list than the New York Times.

I don't have the problem with tether that everyone else does to be honest. It clearly has the confidence of the market, the people putting their money on the line, and that speaks volumes. Rather than an air-backed pumping mechanism, I think it's much more likely to be intended to provide big players with smooth, arms-length, reliable shuffling of fiat money into cryptocurrency and back, without being at the mercy of legacy industry controlled intermediaries.
But it's a side issue, relating to the current value, rather than the more important sociopolitical angle.

Fees are a market. If people value the block space highly enough, of course it could get to $500/tx. But you might find that a single $500 on-chain transaction anchors thousands of transactions occurring on layers above the blockchain.
As the block reward disappears, fees will become the defining metric in assessing Bitcoin's security. Absent some deus ex machina tech breakthrough, we very much need high (on-chain) fees.

Wallets are really just a set of private keys. A paper wallet means these keys are written on paper.
A hardware wallet (is this what you mean by physical?) is a device intended to make using your private keys safer, by keeping them out of the reach of a general purpose computer. This means there's a bit of software on e.g. a windows machine which prepares a transaction, then asks the hardware wallet to sign it (i.e. make it valid in the eyes of the bitcoin network) using the appropriate private key(s).
@_date: 2018-08-13 15:34:38
Ah, okay, my apologies.
I don't know if it's worth mentioning to noobs, but- bitcoins are not 'sent from place to place'. A bitcoin transaction is a message to the network saying 'the key needed to spend this bitcoin is now the one corresponding to this (i.e. the receiving) address'.
I personally do not believe banks will disappear. Custody of bearer instruments is hard, and will only become more so. Bitcoin's true quarry is central banks - specifically their ability to manipulate monetary policy in ways which harm individuals.

Imagine what must have happened to get to this point. The desertion of fiat currency which must have occurred to get to this stage, where half the world owns BTC. There are only 21 million bitcoins, so anyone with a single coin right now has enough for mansions &amp; lambos out the wazoo. It will necessarily be spent, mainly because people selling cool stuff wont accept anything else. People will be desperate to get rid of e.g. USD (see gresham's law).
The main obstructions to this situation coming to pass relate to scaling (can a blockchain support billions of people &amp; remain censorship resistant) &amp; security (can a fee market support a sufficient level of security, once the block reward is small).
Thanks for the pointers!

Blockchains are horrible, inefficient, and slow. The only reason to use one is when there's absolutely no alternative. The only situation we've so far found where they're useful is in the censorship-resilient exchange/transferal/etc. of *native digital bearer assets*.
Every other use you see (e.g. keeping track or real-world assets) is a fraud, wherein 'blockchain' is only a marketing buzzword.
(nb- I'm talking about the primary purpose of a blockchain. Services like timestamping can piggyback on a blockchain like Bitcoin's)

Buy from a reputable exchange (gemini in US are considered good), send it to an address for which you have the keys. If you're not very confident regarding tech, I'd definitely consider a Trezor hardware wallet. Otherwise, an Electrum wallet generated in TailsOS (google it) is appropriately secure.
Memorise the seed if you can, but in any case ensure it is securely backed up (engraved in steel is popular).

Nothing is guaranteed for sure. Notable though, is the complete dearth of well-argued &amp; solidly constructed theories as to what Bitcoin's fatal weaknesses are, or will be.
Almost every Bitcoin-sceptic article/paper/opinion piece I've ever read was predicated on basic misunderstandings, rather than insightful analyses of flaws/etc.
I kinda thirst for some really rigorous analysis of the flaws from an expert 'on the outside', but they're all seemingly so far behind those on the inside it doesn't happen. In fact, by far the most cogent criticism/pessimistic writing I've read on Bitcoin has come from current core devs.

There are of course edge cases where visa/mastercard fear to tread right now, and for that btc works.

Not a larger block size, but a number of inputs which was too big for pre-0.8 nodes to handle.


40% of miners had upgraded their nodes to v.0.8 (which could handle so many inputs fine), so for them the block was valid. The other 60% had not yet upgraded.


Not transactions, inputs. It was a flaw in pre-0.8 software.

Stability will only emerge when the amount of money in bitcoin is much, much larger than the amount entering/leaving across small time frames.

Whole thing rests on the precept that Bitcoin is *inherently* more volatile than its competition, but no evidence is provided. Because none exists.
Bitcoin is a tiny market with huge PR. Volatility is a function of this, and will reduce accordingly (i.e., when the amount of money inside BTC is much larger than the amounts those on the outside can push in/pull out).
This is basic stuff. Much harder to get fooled if you have a little bit of understanding.

A 'move fast and break stuff' approach always has an early phase wherein it looks great, is moving fast, and nothing is yet broken.
Since blockchains only make sense when censorship resilience is important, and since Ethereum's design leads inexorably toward decentralisation-killing resource hoggery, something's gotta give.
In the long run, assuming smart contracts *need* decentralisation, I think they will be built on some layer sitting atop the Bitcoin blockchain. If smart contracts don't need Bitcoin's unique security proposition, I don't think a blockchain is remotely useful to them.

His major misunderstanding is that you can have a meaningfully secure blockchain without a native, value-bearing token underpinning the security model. It's a really common error among people who've only half-internalised how Bitcoin works.
The second point - about a deflationary economy - is more interesting, and definitely worth exploring. I personally agree with his description, but not his conclusion that it's a bad thing.
Two things I'd like to see in my lifetime are a reduction in the number of hours humans are obliged to work (rather than pursue their own interests), and a reduction in the rate at which we burn through Earth's resources. The former is likely to come about anyway, through increasing automation. The latter is obligatory if we are to keep the planet habitable.

First thing we knew was WU sent an email 'confirming your request to cancel the transaction'. We hadn't made such a request, so phoned them up to tell them there must be a mistake. The WU representative went to talk to a supervisor, then came back explaining their 'business decision'. This after dozens of similar transactions to the same recipient over a number of years.
I guess we could ask them to put it in writing, but I'd rather just leave them to fester in their own decisions. I also know that businesses can be effectively forced to do such things - i.e. the govt. can easily make sending, say, more than $100 to a certain country impossible. Or if not impossible, at least much more trouble than it's worth.
Not defending them, but I can imagine a situation where the profit made from transactions to certain countries doesn't cover the potential costs of getting it wrong and accidentally funding ISIS/Al Qaida/etc. (I kid, we all know these are funded through western intelligence agencies ;-).

No worries, I guess sensitivities are high.
Henna is in a funny position that it tends to flourish in the same regions as radical Islam. And it consists of dried leaves milled into a very fine, pale green powder.
These two facts mean that for the first few years of importing it, every single pouch/box/bag/whatever arrived thoroughly stabbed by the fine officers of our country's customs service. I think they only stopped when we were approved for an import licence (or they got sick of having dark brown stains all over their hands?).
But it also means (supposition on my part here, and being generous) that WU felt uncomfortable continuing to play a part in the remittance of funds to these countries. Whatever. As you say, bitcoin is an ideal work-around.
We'd probably have started paying in bitcoin sooner, and indeed I set up a bitpay account for our website about 6 months ago, but our typical customer isn't usually on the forefront of technology, so haven't had enough BTC sat around waiting to be spent.

Personally I worry a lot about the damage banks do to the world using my money. A cursory examination throws up a hundred types of misery caused by these parasites, but for a while they were necessary and in many ways beneficial.
I agree that security is a problem for anything done through computers. I disagree that this is a problem particular to bitcoin. The same objections were raised in relation to the wild concept of internet shopping a while back. Despite continuing hacks of retailers' payment databases, internet shopping grows apace.
These problems you mention affect all computer/money interactions. The difference is that with bitcoin, I don't have to send every retailer I use the credentials needed to withdraw my entire balance.

Helping you stopped being interesting when you started lying, so after this reply we're done.
In general language, as long as the rate of increase continues to experience increase itself, "exponential" is accurate.
In mathematics, exponentials adhere to the form f(x)=b^x.
That's it. Can you understand that while all of the latter are included in the former, the reverse is not true? Some of the graphs linked above meet the former definition, but are very unlikely to meet the latter.
So the next time you hear about a company experiencing "exponential growth", know that there's a separate, looser definition of the word exponential, and the company's growth is not necessarily exactly defined by a specific mathematical function.
@_date: 2017-02-14 12:27:30
Fine by me. LN's a great idea.

It can't, but happily that's not how Bitcoin works. We all (users, miners, businesses) chose software &amp; participate in an experiment. If core controlled the code, BU wouldn't exist.


Changes in the protocol can affect the emergent properties of the Bitcoin network. The changes BU devs propose skew the dynamic towards increased centralisation. You might be comfortable with *how far* BU goes with this, but you can't reasonably claim it isn't the case.
Overall, you're arguing that BU is acting in good faith, and I fundamentally disagree. Just as Tobacco manufacturers bribed journalists &amp; regulators, and just as Big Oil wears a shit-eating grin as newly-rich politicians quibble with scientific orthodoxy on climate change, so the Goldman Sachs/JP Morgans/etc. are throwing tens of millions at the effort to break Bitcoin.

That will only be the case if the value soars, which in turn will make spending (transacting in) it very attractive.
Or do you mean 'transact often'? If so, you could be right. I'd still be very happy with Bitcoin in general, but it's why I support segwit &amp; hope that a sufficient majority of miners will support it without a fork.

Value is a function of utility. While no protocol change is guaranteed to raise the value of Bitcoin, those that make it more useful stand a good chance of doing so.

It kinda does, but is as unknowable as "what will the price of 1BTC be in 2067". I say kinda, because mining doesn't stop when all 21m bitcoin are issued, it just carries on.
The cost of securing the network will relate to the total value of the network, but there are too many other variables in play to come up with a sensible forecast of the year 2140 totals.
We *can* say though that Bitcoin is orders of magnitude more efficient than the industries it is replacing. The cost of mining is a favoured talking point of Bitcoin's many detractors, and it's true in a way - the network currently consumes the same energy as a US town of 200,000 people, moving only around $250m a day.
But when you factor in the tens of thousands of buildings &amp; vehicles involved in the modern banking &amp; remittance industries, the millions of employees pootling into work each day to shuffle papers, and realise that Bitcoin can replace all of this, it stops being a big worry.
@_date: 2017-02-16 22:55:44

Which is it, the 2017 cost, or the cost including difficulty changes? In truth, we have no way to predict the future hash rate of miners, so your question is impossible to answer.
Separately, "the above mentioned resources" *are* what secures the network. It's not possible to re-allocate them towards network improvements without negating everything the network is about.

Appreciate any attempt at peacemaking, but I think we've already passed the point of no return.
From my perspective, Bitcoin is under attack from those who stand to lose most from its widespread adoption. BU is designed to alter the protocol so as to facilitate central control. Any compromise the attackers can force is by definition worse than the status quo, so here we are.
Additionally, I think any altcoin/technical solution that promises a way forward will be subject to the same attacks, as and when it becomes a credible threat, just as Bitcoin has.
@_date: 2019-03-14 12:39:10
It's generally accepted that a front-loaded distribution scheme is necessary to ensure the system successfully bootstraps itself.
If you're going to point to aspects of Bitcoin's design and claim them to be flaws, you must contend with the fact that these same design features have made Bitcoin a wild success thus far. Incomparably so, truth told.
It's good that you're evaluating Bitcoin critically, we need more of that. But perhaps read up on others' insights/musings before setting out your own thoughts? We've covered a lot of ground in 10 years.

Absolutely, but authoritarianism looks different in different countries. In e.g. the US, media manipulation* &amp; regulation that heavily favours incumbents are popular, with tricks like civil forfeiture laws mopping up the scraps.
(* I realise that happens more in China/Russia/etc. The difference is that unlike the west, the populations are under no illusions, so fewer are fooled.)


It's a worry, but not a big one thanks to the foresight of SN et al when they designed the protocol. With China making all the ASICs, and having built dozens of unused hydroelectric dams, it was probably inevitable. I think this is the high-water mark for Chinese mining in any case.

But it didn't feel real, and the following year's slow decline kinda cast those months in a negative light.
The difference to today is night and day imho. There's so much more in the way of a real economy now, and the tenor of the interest from the financial world has flipped from derisive to pragmatic, at least in comparison to then.

Bitcoin is an experiment - nothing is guaranteed. It attempts something audacious &amp; improbable, and though it has cleared a number of difficult hurdles, there are more to come. The successful transition from block reward to fee market is a big one.
I'm cautiously optimistic though, and much more so than I was even a year ago. It's now pretty easy to see how the pieces come together such that individual on-chain transactions become the anchors for a great many transactions, across a great many people.
There will be fees to pay (and they'll be explicit, rather than the silent background taxes that banks and payments companies extract today), but it doesn't look like they'll need to be too expensive - in fact we'll likely pay less overall than we do now in the fiat system.

Because the hostility you perceive is based on circumstances rather than dogma. When the circumstances change, so will opinion (though a hard fork is probably best avoided if possible).


As above. If bandwidth keeps increasing, bigger blocks may become safe. Until then, big blockers are flogging a dead horse, and bitcoiners found they preferred not having to pick through dozens of misinformed rants to find the news they were interested in.


In some ways, yes. In others, no. Right now a fork is neither safe nor necessary (we need a fee market to develop to replace the block reward). That might change.

Everything back then was *much* more tenuous. Bitcoin is now a lot older &amp; better established. The ecosystem is hugely wider/deeper than it was. Few back then were as confident in bitcoin's future.
£10k was about 8 times the previous high, and the image of bitcoin was mainly related to illicit uses. Nowadays people think primarily in terms of investment/hedging, everyday payments, and a potential new class of micropayments (with all the innovative, previously impossible business models that implies).
$60k is barely 3 times 2017's high, and the infrastructure for on-boarding the next cohort of users is orders of magnitude more advanced.

If someone's claiming to have a blockchain, but (say) it purports to secure something outside the blockchain like pork bellies or car parts, then it's a scam.
Scam's an emotive word, and I don't doubt that many companies running such blockchains do so in good faith, but that doesn't mean they haven't been sold snake-oil somewhere along the line.
In the cases you give (google, ibm, etc.), the best that can be said is they're using an extremely inefficient database format for their purposes.

You mean in a 'nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded' sort of way?

No, that undoes all the mixing. You have to send each utxo to a separate address, and ensure they are never re-associated with each other.


A decent answer would require a bunch of knowledge on your part. Suffice to say that's just how bitcoin works. UTXOs *have* to be entirely spent. Similarly, you can't pay for a $5 beer by tearing a $10 bill in half. You have to spend the whole thing, and get back change.

Depends how you use it, but not really-
If you download the latest version, verify the sigs, burn to a dvd, then boot from that, there's none of your usage history, and the potential for e.g. viruses is massively reduced. Once shut down, there's no trace of anything you did.
To me this is qualitatively different from exposing your keys to a machine used day-to-day for all sorts.

Never store bitcoin on a website.
How you store it kinda depends on how much you're buying. Small amounts are fine on e.g. a phone wallet. For larger amounts you need a hardware wallet, or (free option) an electrum wallet set up within TailsOS.

Either are fine, but Trezor would get my vote. A long history of doing things the right way (e.g. open source, vulnerability handling, keeping it simple stupid), where Ledger has had to be dragged towards good behaviour by social pressure.

Part of not getting scammed on this big scary internet of ours, is learning to read between the lines, feel the mood, and pay attention to what's *not* being said. Some scammers are very sophisticated at hiding their intentions, and manage to trick most people most of the time.
Happily, Coingeek are about as transparent as it's possible to be. If you get tricked by them, it's pretty certain you (a fool) were going to parted from your money somehow, likely in the short term.
This appended paragraph *screams* to anyone paying even slight attention, that the site is not neutral, but is instead pushing an agenda.
Bitcoin has truly been lucky in attracting such low grade scammers at this early stage in its life (Ver, Wu, Wright, Ayers, etc.).

Read about TailsOS. It's a security-hardended version of linux, and comes bundled with electrum.
It runs from a dvd or usb drive, so no info persists to get stolen.
Your wallet exists only as the seed words (though you can export the 'master public key' to a phone or PC, which allows you to generate new receiving addresses, and keep an eye on your funds, without risking their security).
Electrum running in a normal (e.g. windows) environment cannot be considered safe, even if encrypted.

Your questions must articulate a coherent worldview, or they stop being questions and start requiring me to teach you basic aspects of bitcoin's operation.
LN will allow bitcoiners to make each on-chain transaction representative of *many* instantaneous, very cheap lightning payments. So on-chain fees will be high (and miners will still provide sufficient security), but bitcoiners will be paying a very low amount *per-transaction*.
For example- You might pay 300 Ksats for your on-chain fee (pricey in today's money, but worth much more in the future), to facilitate a few thousand LN transactions.
This is cool because miners get the necessary income (security!), blocks stay small (censor-resistance!), and transactions effectively become instant and very cheap on an individual basis (user experience!).
The alternative, a block size increase, aims to provide too much space thereby killing the fee market (less security), bloats the bandwidth required for verification (easier to censor), and actually gets slower (since you now have to wait longer for the same level of confidence, because the fees paid to miners are too low to foster much hashpower).

That's like saying 'police force blacklisted by gangland boss'.

The claim you make in your headline is immediately undermined by your acknowledging that you can get bitcoin in other ways (mining, working for it, etc).
But am I right in thinking your objection is that Bitcoin didn't pop into the world with a complete &amp; functioning economy? That there should be no intermediate phase between its invention, and the full realisation of its potential?
Do you actually think that would have been possible? I don't.
What I do think is that Bitcoin is 10 years old, already has millions of users, and has gone from worthless to ~$4k per coin in that time. It looks to me like Bitcoin is a wild success, and couldn't realistically have been expected to make speedier progress towards its intended goals than it has.

It's an intentional part of the design that the block reward eventually ends (and fees take over).

It's trivial to incorporate QC resistance into bitcoin (in fact it's fairly resistant already if you don't reuse addresses), but it hasn't yet been done because even the most optimistic proponents of QC admit we're at least a decade away (and more likely two) from having to react.

But you're on much shakier ground with the other stuff. There's no point in any blockchain/cryptocurrency if it's not censor resistant. Google sheets is preferable for that case.
Ethereum forsook a cogent plan to remain government-proof when it opted for bloating &amp; short-term success over long-term resilience. It might as well operate from AWS (but then you realise 'what's the point'? What am I achieving?).
Sia is similar, though not as broken as Ethereum. I think its goals are laudable (and they're very nice people) but that's not enough to make it a resilient working system. You might not like PoW, but wishing another way was possible doesn't actually make it possible.

Armies are pretty expensive. But you're confused - we're not talking about the (undoubted) problems of the fiat system.


Legitimacy is neither here nor there. The proper grounds for comparison with banks is whether they are in a position to redeem their token for fiat. When they were backing their tokens 1:1 with fiat money in the bank, we could say that they were roughly as safe as the bank was. We can no longer say that.

Download TailsOS. It's a TOR-using security-hardened version of linux that ships with a bundled electrum wallet, and is designed to run from a dvd or usb stick (meaning your PC has no trace of its presence).
If you're ultra paranoid, do this by buying an old laptop you use for nothing else, and download only from someone else's wifi in an area without cctv. I personally don't think this level of precaution is necessary unless you face state-level enemies (in which case your lack of knowledge will soon lead you to make mistakes).

That's not really answering the question.
I get it - *you* can't see the value in it, so there can't possibly be any value in it. But clearly other people feel differently, and unless that changes (i.e. demand falls), then the supply halving *will* have a significant impact on price.
Bitcoin might die, that is true.  But your problem with it seems to amount to 'it didn't pop into existence fully-formed, with a mature economy and billions of active users'. I put it to you that this was never a plausible outcome, and is therefore not an appropriate yardstick against which to judge bitcoin's progress.
You are possibly so used to centralization (and the many benefits it brings), that you are unable to evaluate decentralized systems on their own terms. But you should at least remain open to the possibility that you are missing something.

Who says that? My own feeling is that it's probably too large to be safe, but that lowering it is not practical while most governments are not in full-blown attack mode. We are where we are.
Assuming the generally available bandwidth keeps rising, it will one day be acceptably safe to raise limit. If it's also necessary/desirable, we will likely do so.
I can't help but look back over your posts &amp; conclude that much of your confusion stems from misapprehension of the principles &amp; facts driving bitcoiners' approach. If things were as you think they are, you'd have a point. But they aren't.

This is why we like open source software. You might not be able to understand it, but many can.

I dig your enthusiasm, but please consider being realistic, &amp; considering the nature of a transitional phase, between one state and the next.
It's like you're lying down, and want to be stood-up straight (bear with me... ) - there might be some odd midpoint position, whereby you're in some weird one-hand-on-the-floor, knees-bent, body creased up stance that in no way resembles your intended final state.
Centralized exchanges are like this intermediate position; a phase you go through which, though not anything like where you want to be, happens to lie on an efficient path thereto. You wouldn't want to stay there long, but as a through-route it's more than acceptable.
If Bitcoin *does* get stopped, it for sure won't be stopped by that sort of shit.

The only way to avoid this manipulation would have been for bitcoin to be worth trillions on day one. Assuming you realise this is not possible, can you see that this manipulation is a phase?
Bitcoin is a tiny asset class with the profile of something many times larger. Though a good thing overall, this brings with it certain short term issues. Traders who would be tiny in traditional market terms are able to push bitcoin markets around, making money on longs/shorts as they do so.
As bitcoin's value grows, and as it diversifies into more &amp; more of the world's economy, the effect will shrink until it's no longer there. In the meantime, hodlers are unaffected.
@_date: 2019-11-15 12:34:37
The obvious answer is 'ideological reasons'.
But to address your specific worry - you wouldn't accept wages in bitcoin because the value could go down. But the value could also go up.
Nobody knows which will happen, but so far bitcoin has gone up much more than it has gone down. This key fact means some people are happy to take a risk - I do not believe many would otherwise do so.

The problem with similar-sounding, non-standard unit prefixes? They're similar-sounding and non-standard.
But since bitcoin is apparently based on Japanese number systems (i.e. zeroes are grouped into fours, rather than threes), perhaps Japanese prefixes would be more suitable. So a satoshi could be 1 shabitcoin, 0.01 BTC could be 1 rinbitcoin, etc.

Haha, I'm regretting having said anything... First, you have to speak in bitcoin, not $.
Currently (simplified version), if you want to mix a 0.2 btc utxo, you send 0.1 to two different addresses, then get two 0.1 payments back. These are separate utxos, and the mixing has made is so nobody can connect them to the original 0.2 btc.
If you then want to buy something, for 0.05, you spend one of the mixed utxos, and get back 0.05 btc in change to a new address (this is trustless and part of the bitcoin protocol).
Now you've got 0.15 btc left. If you spend this 0.15 in a single transaction, you effectively negate the mixing you did to begin with.

You can't steal people's bitcoin with a 51% attack, and I don't think anyone would call 51% attacks 'hacks'.

Unspent transaction output. It's the name for a concept used when describing how bitcoin transactions work. When you make a transaction you're taking one (or more) utxo, and using it as the input.
Say you need to pay a 0.5 btc bill. In your wallet you may have a utxo worth 0.4 btc, and one worth 0.3 btc (from previous transactions). These are used as inputs for a new transaction, with outputs of 0.5 btc (the bill), and 0.1999 (your change). The extra 0.0001 is a fee, claimed by the miner who finds the block in which your transaction is included.
So for your coinjoin to be effective, you must never allow the resulting utxos to mix. You have to label &amp; segregate your change addresses, basically.

When you use mycelium your private keys are exposed to the OS, a sprawling and complex bit of software riddled with holes, both intentionally and by accident. The more you know about how computers work, the more this terrifies you.

It's also a good reminder that what shitcoiners disparagingly refer to as 'bitcoin maximalism' should properly be thought of as scam prevention.
Sadly, Bitcoin possesses what turns out to be an easily abused design feature - it's designed to continue working in adverse circumstances. This means that in fair weather, systems without Bitcoin's protections (bcash, ripple, ethereum, etc.) appear faster/cheaper/easier.
It's only when the going gets rough - tyrannical governments attempt to extinguish cryptocurrencies, say - that the reasoning behind Bitcoin's design becomes apparent.

Can you see how this would be confusing, and lead your stupid monkey brain to mix up a number with its position? Well, the result can be that (for some program or code snippet) the number you want the code to return ends up being 'off by one'.

That *is* one of the fundamental incentive structures underpinning bitcoin. It's one of Satoshi's key insights. We need miners to provide security, and the block reward is falling away. A suitable limit on the number of transactions that can fit in a block is vital, such that a fee market arises to provide miners with appropriate recompense/profit. So to be clear, in the future Bitcoin will require full blocks or it will fail.
Pretty basic stuff honestly, I'm surprised this is even a question.

The balance was found by what had consensus. That's how Bitcoin works. If you're asking what persuaded individuals to run nodes enforcing a particular limit, there are surely multiple answers.
I remember some research (by bitmex I think) showing that segwit2x's bandwidth requirements had the potential to kick 95% of nodes off the network within 6 months, though that was a few years ago now. But that's the sort of thing users will have considered.

I'm not sure you'll ever see privacy by default in Bitcoin, it's just too contentious (I myself would like it, but I wouldn't split the network to get there).
With Taproot/Schnorr (upgrades likely to make it into Bitcoin relatively soon), there is the potential to achieve effective privacy, on the blockchain, with transactions that are indistinguishable from non-private ones.
That's my understanding anyway. Here's a good talk on the subject (the video is about 45m, but it's questions for the last 20m or so).

If nodes don't relay your transaction, it will *never* clear, because it never makes it to miners.
No-fee transactions were possible before nodes implemented this filter. I sent plenty prior to ~early 2014 iirc. It's not a rule in Bitcoin's protocol, just a spam-stopping thing.
Long-term, bitcoin is intended to transition from paying miners with block subsidies (i.e. the 12.5 btc per block of newly minted bitcoin they currently get), to paying miners with transaction fees. So it seems a bad idea to encourage no-fee transactions today.

And remember, most of the 167GB is the actually the bitcoin blockchain before they forked away in August 2017. Additionally, they were circulating software 6 months back designed to churn out fake transactions, to pretend they had loads of users. It's a scam all the way down.
These aren't even their biggest problems- If I was a bcasher, I'd be terrified of a hostile reorg. Because instead of moving to a new hashing algorithm, they hilariously stuck with bitcoin's SHA256. It would take less than 2% of the bitcoin network's hashpower to permanently mire their blockchain in endless reorganisations, making it impossible to trust bcash transactions. That decision alone guaranteed their fate.

Most/all nodes are configured to refuse to relay zero-fee transactions, mainly as an anti-spam measure. Just a couple of pennies is more than enough to get relayed, so it doesn't affect real usage.
This assumes blocks have free space of course. If not, you are competing with other users for that space, and need to set your fees accordingly - miners will fill blocks by choosing transactions with the best fees first.
@_date: 2019-11-28 18:53:49
I still don't think the incentives stack up in a way that makes a 51% attack attractive. It just doesn't have the devastating consequences for trust/confidence implied by the question.

The idea is that you send a second transaction, and yes - that needs to be confirmed.
But the point is that your original transaction isn't confirming, and this second one (whether rbf or cpfp) solves that by increasing the fee. If you make the second transaction's fee high enough, your transaction(s) will confirm in the next block.

This phrase is what's leading you astray - inflation is the net effect of dozens of different factors on prices. Few of the relevant influences act across the board. Monetary supply is a big part of it, but you have to consider myriad currents in all the world's industries, on both supply and demand sides, to come to a true picture.
Worse, inflation is experienced differently by different participants - sectors and tiers - in the economy. The more you try to pin it down, the more you just highlight the inadequacy of your chosen measurements.
@_date: 2019-03-06 14:42:36
This take ignores the way complex systems necessarily develop via iteration, rather than arriving fully formed on day one.
It also misses the encouragement that bitcoin spending gives those parts of the ecosystem who do not accept bitcoin to jump on board.
When I spend and replace with businesses who accept bitcoin (even if they swap to fiat immediately), it puts a pressure on non-bitcoin-accepting businesses. They see a revenue stream to which they can fairly painlessly gain access, and slowly, they get their BTCPay servers up and running. So the circle becomes incrementally closer to closing.

Since so many of the companies involved in 'crypto' exist on a spectrum from naive to fraudulent, you *really* need to know what's what from a tech point of view to make an informed decision about any investment.

Hence the bit about not reusing addresses. Until you broadcast to the network a transaction involving a UTXO associated with a particular keypair, the public key is not revealed (because addresses are hashes of the public key), so cannot be attacked as you imply.

You would know not to leave a bar of gold lying out on your front lawn, or thousands of dollars in plain view in your car. Is there some message, sign, or warning that the wallet dev could have put in front of you, that would've made you treat your bitcoin similarly?
Every half-decent wallet these days has 'write down your seed' warnings, but as your case shows, these are not necessarily followed.
Can you think of some way - maybe a different process, or some specific piece of guidance - that would have stopped you making this mistake?

Bitcoin has been incredibly, almost logic-defyingly successful since its launch. That alone should probably give you pause for thought when attempting to 'correct' its design.
Many people look at a 10 year old bitcoin and thing 'I wish there was more of it left to mine', without realising that they probably wouldn't *want* to mine it, had the issuance schedule been structured differently.
The balance we're trying to strike is between ensuring the system bootstraps successfully, and ensuring that future hashrate is incentivized. On the evidence so far, it's hard to argue that bitcoin has strayed far from the optimal course.

Even when we don't have the right word? This is how language works.
What stops a currency unit from acting as a 'share' in a country? Well, there's more that affects the value of a currency than 'how well a country is doing'. Everything from balance of trade to monetary policy (interest rates, etc.) push a currency's value around. Countries can be booming but see their currency fall, and vice versa. So terms like money supply, GDP, etc arise to describe aspects of the whole.
Bitcoin has no state backing, so many of the normal complexities are gone. In their place are revolutionary undertakings like rootstock and DAO. How these new concepts relate to underlying currency value is yet to be known.
Against a background of shifting meanings and unknown unknowns, 'market cap' is as useful as any other term (but as above, unqualified comparisons between bitcoin and companies are potentially misleading).

Not really. Most likely it will confirm fine, since it's a valid address.

Address re-use is a danger to privacy right now.
It *potentially* decreases the security of bitcoin stored at that address in the future, if Bitcoin's Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is broken.
So if privacy is not a concern, address re-use is acceptable right now so long as the private key holder is abreast of developments in the attempt to break ECDSA, and moves coins out to a new address before it becomes a reality.

One of the biggest problems with Bitcoin right now is this transparency, and associated loss of privacy. We have a situation right now whereby a small purchase can paint a giant "rob me" sign on your back, no fancy analysis or spying required.
You only have to see all the confused, not-even-wrong noob questions basic transactions generate to understand that most people are unable to mitigate this problem (e.g. by swapping into Monero and back to break associations). Even if you know what to do, it's a hassle, creating overheads that needn't exist.
Fixes are in the pipeline, but we've seen how even no-brainer technical upgrades can be held hostage for years, so for me it's a big concern looking ahead.

It happens regularly (almost daily iirc), but briefly. Miners choose which block to build on, find new blocks, and quickly one side of the split is clearly 'winning'. At this point, no miner will look for new blocks on the losing side, and the split is gone.
Worst case is that some transactions were confirmed (in the losing block) that now revert to the mempool. This is one reason why you see businesses waiting for (e.g.) 6 confirmations.

And the reverse is true - segwit activation means no need for 2x fork of Bitcoin. But I was really saying that the birth of a new coin should minimise disruption, and any 'big blocks plus segwit' coin would be much more sensibly achieved by a soft fork of Bcash than a hard fork of Bitcoin.

Not as safe as the open source equivalent in some respects.
Much easier for the French government to force a backdoor into a Ledger than a Trezor, for example. Whether you think that's likely is another question, but I see no reason to take the risk.
Ledger fans argue that their acceptance of closed source means they can use fancy extra-secure hardware not available to open source alternatives. This is arguably true, but is analogous to being able to boast the worlds strongest front door, and accepting in return that you are not even allowed to review the safety of your backdoor/windows/etc.

BitPay were just caught (in the early stages of) attempting to defraud users by telling them they'd be getting bitcoin, but actually sending them an altcoin worth a fraction of what they'd paid for. Send your coins somewhere else asap (for 0.1BTC, a desktop wallet like Electrum, or an android wallet such as Samourai is probably sufficient).
I would add that BitPay were previously a fine company, but were bought ~6 months ago as part of the Bitmain-funded failed power-grab, and changed essentially overnight.
Forks like 2x are attempts to take over Bitcoin - well financed and with much marketing, but ultimately transparent. There have been many in the past (most recently resulting in Bcash), and they will continue to occur. The only thing you have to do is tie yourself to the mast, plug your ears with wax, and hodl.
Being your own bank means understanding &amp; remaining vigilant for con-artists trying to steal your stash. When you have something this valuable, there are no shortage of such hucksters.

It's not a terrible argument, but the appropriate endgame for 'fork attacks' on bitcoin is that nobody attempts them, because nobody engages with them, because they're worthless. But worthless may in fact be too kind - dumping these shitcoins subtracts privacy and opens key-stealing vectors.

Mining costs are not ever-increasing, but if they were, that wouldn't mean each trade would take take longer. There are negative feedback systems in place which keep such things on an even keel.
So much criticism of bitcoin is like this - a smartypants thinks for a few minutes and becomes convinced they've identified a flaw that has not come up in a decade of development by some of the world's brightest minds.

Online only needed to send btc.
Sending = using a private key to move bitcoin to another address. This must be communicated online.
Receiving = someone using their private key to move bitcoin to your address. This happens on the blockchain whether or not you personally are online (though your wallet won't know about the transaction until you are online again)

People who focus on the price have forgotten how to be angry.
Bitcoin came about shortly after we 'discovered' just how our financial system works for banks. We always knew that the dice were loaded, but when the richest people in the world's bets failed to pay out for the first time in living memory, government coffers were emptied into their pockets (under the guise of 'too big to fail') in the biggest robbery ever perpetrated. And it was all pre-planned-
Bitcoin is simply a cryptographic refuge from these psychopaths.

Is language not more organic than that? Terms are developed for everyday ease. Whether it's micron or angstrom or parsec or whatever, shorthand names are spontaneously born of need. Not to replace SI-standard notation, but to humanise it I guess.
I think if something was genuinely being invented pointlessly for shits &amp; giggles, it just wouldn't catch on (see 'bits', for example).

If you're buying a lot, get a hardware wallet (trezor, ledger, etc.). Otherwise, the most security is offered by the default core wallet- 
That said, there's a large amount of data to download with that one, and other wallets that avoid this download (in exchange for a small security hit) now exist. Of these, I like Electrum.
You should do everything in your power to avoid exposing your private keys on a windows PC, and really on any device which has a significant chance of being compromised. If you're able to, try using the Electrum wallet bundled with TailsOS (which you boot from a DVD/USB stick) - it's the best free balance between usability and security available right now.

You need do nothing, because you own your own keys.
Segwit is a technical upgrade which will activate soon. Its a no-brainer and really shouldn't have been contentious, but some parties tried to 'hold it hostage', insisting they'd only let it activate if they were given control of Bitcoin. Users resisted this, and eventually won.
Forthcoming forks are kind of similar - attacks intended to wrest control of the dominant cryptocurrency, turning it from decentralized towards a centrally managed model (allowing someone to be the 'boss').
Users will resist these attacks and Bitcoin will carry on regardless. There will be a lot of piss &amp; wind, but as long as you own your own private keys, you'll be golden.

Yes, it's the next fork that'll attempt to pass itself off as Bitcoin.


I think you're a little muddled here - Segwit is an upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol, coded by core and shortly to be activated.
Segwit2x, by contrast, is the name given to an agreement a few businesses came to, without any technical input, to wait for the activation of segwit &amp; follow it with a hard fork. So it's two parts, the first of which is uncontroversial &amp; has effectively happened (i.e. segwit is shortly to 'go live'), the second of which is an unnecessary and technically illiterate/dangerous fork, which will create a new coin like Bcash.

But you definitely know more about this than me, so I'll consider myself corrected, cheers :-)

That's the default position, held by a large majority of users. The reason it doesn't seem like that is that a lot of money is being spent on marketing (the prize - control of Bitcoin - makes such expenditure potentially worth it).


Pretty much. Both Segwit2x and Bcash have maximum possible block sizes of 8Mb. The best analysis we have shows that blocks this large could kill 95% of nodes within 6 months, leading to a terminal decline in decentralisation (so making other attacks easier).
Whether these repeated attempts to inflate the block size are part of a malicious attack or simply a series of misguided-but-well-meaning botch jobs is a matter for speculation (I think it's a mix of malicious attackers and useful idiots).

Not true- the best analysis we have shows that the maximum block size with segwit &amp; 2Mb (i.e. 8Mb) could kill 95% of nodes within 6 months. If nodes only work in a datacentre scenario, governments would find it pretty easy to kill Bitcoin completely.

It's secure and works fine, and I used to use it in android, but not any more: 
There were some behind-the-scenes changes early this year (new devs &amp; management), following which they made some stupid changes (e.g. adverts in the wallet interface - now removed). I then saw a mildly pissy exchange wherein someone from the company, in response to a user pointing out the inappropriateness of adverts in a wallet, had a bit of a 'well how do you expect us to make money' meltdown. Given the privacy implications of a wallet trying to monetise its user-base in some way, I had to bail (currently very impressed with Samourai).
A shame, because the local trader function was cool.

I wouldn't call myself an expert, but I've been watching bitcoin markets for a long time. I was expecting about twice the retracement (i.e. from $4400 to about $3200), and for it to last at least a few days longer. Because of this, I'd be wary of declaring recovery just yet.

You are doing great. If anything, you've quite a small amount compared to your income.
It seems all I read about are scaling issues, but every transaction I make (about 40 so far this year) works as expected, and for the promised tiny fee (i.e. &lt;€0.15).
No doubt Bitcoin has to scale up its transaction capacity to cope with its increasing popularity. Segwit and Lightning are going to do that in a way that simply bumping the block size never can, with the latter adding instant payment functionality too.
To me, the 'blocksize debate' is clearly an attack on the network, intended to stall adoption of proper scaling, create confusion among non-technical users, and weaken security. Given the stakes &amp; Bitcoin's future potential, it would be weird if such an attack was not under way.

The same protections apply to all EU banks. The £75k protection is just the UK's translation of an EU requirement of €100,000 per customer (plus some additional short-term cover for larger amounts, e.g. when you sell a house).
Fidor covers you to €100,000, being registered in Germany, but banks are international beasts these days. Should the EU collapse, all bets are off - none of the guarantees given by any banks worldwide (and especially in the UK) would be worth a hill of beans.

You're right, but it's not the whole story, is it?
Market cap comparisons with companies may not be perfect, but neither is any other traditional measure. We can for instance compare with gold, but Bitcoin is as dissimilar to gold as to a company - e.g., Bitcoin comes with its own integrated payments system, &amp; an array of unimagined scripting possibilities is around the corner. It's a new paradigm, so naturally we reach for approximations &amp; analogies until adequate language has been invented.
Maybe there are better analogies: I once dreamt the internet was a real physical place you could visit. The details of the dream aren't relevant, but I later realised that Bitcoin is a bit like buying land in a finite cyberspace. While closer to the truth, it's less useful than even the poor metrics we are currently stuck with.

If you hold a few notes, sure. But this action aims to catch people with more.
Once deposited, there will be big questions about how individuals acquired the money. Since this action is about 'black money hoarders', it is to be presumed such questions will be unwelcome.
So it's pretty likely that the hoarders will aim to cash-out the obsolescent notes via multiple others' bank accounts, for a small consideration, and look quickly to store their loot in some other, government-resistant way.
Even if a tiny fraction of those targeted turn to Bitcoin, there's a reasonable chance there's SOMETHING to see here.

Right, but we all know that if you buy a finite good, it will tend to push the price up (or vice versa). This is not something we needed a study to show at this point.
The only way this becomes more than a smear is if they show that Tether's insolvent/fractional, and they avoid the fuck out of that.
Something else that's telling: Tether continues to be valued by the market at ~$1, even after all the innuendo.

I don't agree with the idea that small blocks = digital gold, big blocks = internet money. To me it's a deliberate distraction, intended to legitimize big blocks.
If big blocks came with no downside, we'd be using them already. They'd be great. But for a few technical reasons, they'd make the network less secure. So we can't.
Instead, we engineer a better way to scale that gives us the best of both worlds - the security/wealth preservation qualities of a digital gold, with a transaction capacity far beyond a simple block size increase.

Big Blockers are Bitcoin's version of climate change deniers.
They're either lying to protect their interests, unable to follow the technical arguments, or just plain resentful of experts and their high-falutin fancy words.
With 1MB blocks, as things stand, the network can process a handful of transactions per second. So doubling/tripling/multiplying by 20 the block size really doesn't scale in a useful way.
But by pretending that big blocks *are* the solution, Big Blockers can forestall the real scaling solutions (segwit and the tech it enables), and have a cadre of useful idiots cheer them from the sidelines.
Given the disruption Bitcoin has the potential to cause, it would be astonishing if such attacks were not under way.

Because they don't like bitcoin, and think it only acquired its current value through Tether-related shenanigans.
The truth is Tether was invented to circumvent banks, who'd realised they could fuck with bitcoin traders (who are very sensitive to delays) by holding up their deposits to exchanges.
The people who attack Tether are the same people who try to make the fiat/bitcoin conversion process as difficult as possible, because they're trying to delay the inevitable for as long as possible.
(Note: Never used tether, and this is not an endorsement of it specifically, but it's not a mystery, and it looks to be about as well-run as any of its competitors, especially given the attempts at sabotage it has faced)

It would be great to get an answer from BitPay CEO Stephen Pair ([ u/spair) on the motivation behind this lie, and whether the money his company received was sufficient compensation for the loss of his and his company's credibility.

The wallet.dat is a file containing your private keys. HD key generation means that the keypairs that make up your wallet are derived from a master key, so you can just remember the one master private key &amp; regenerate your individual utxo-holding private keys (and so your addresses) from it.
If you put your wallet.dat in a new machine/install, you will see your whole wallet. If you put that private key - which is not a master key - into a new machine/install, you will just see/have access to the utxo(s) associated with that one address (37Tn1...).

To mine bitcoin successfully (i.e. for it to be financially better than just buying bitcoin) you need very cheap electricity and a high level of technical expertise.
If that's not you, you simply buy a hardware wallet (Trezor or ColdCard are the best), and find an exchange or broker (optimal choice dependant on your location).

Miners are generally disincentivized from attempting to orphan the most recent block - the costs don't stack up. Instead they simply mine on the most recent block found.
But if a naughty miner has a large fraction of the hashpower, the value to be gained from claiming both the fees in the mempool *and* the fees in the most recent block can flip this assumption on its head.
Such a situation is exacerbated by long block times, since there's more potential for very large combined fees to accumulate.

Everything is the same as before, from the point of view of a legacy node, it's just that witness data (of segwit transactions) no longer counts towards the 1MB limit.

Mining can be done anywhere in the world, on specialised hardware or even (pointlessly, but still...) on CPUs/GPUs. To know the *real* hashrate, those devices would have to accurately report every hash they try to some kind of database.
That's essentially impossible, so we instead look at the difficulty &amp; current rate of block finding, and draw out an estimate.

Bitcoin is the scarcest thing in the known universe. Its increases are inevitable, only the timing is alterable.
In 2017 we saw a lot of uncertainty removed when the users demonstrated bitcoins core properties, seeing off an attempted take-over by a cabal of businesses. I'd argue that this botched putsch delayed for a year much of the rise expected/derived from the 2016 halving.
The next halving is expected in ~9 months, and there appears to be no similar attack on the horizon.

They claim to support big blocks, the argument being there'd be more room for transactions.
And while there *would* be more room for transactions (i.e. twice as many transactions per second with 2MB vs 1MB), there would also be new attack vectors. And doubling/quadrupling is kinda lame, doesn't really get us any closer to Visa's capacity for instance. So people said "is there a better way?"
The better way core came up with is segwit. With segwit, the overall block size does increase, but instead of a mere doubling or quadrupling of transaction throughput, segwit lays the foundation for thousands of transactions per second (and many other cool things too).
So you can see why it must be stopped!

The usual advice: Maybe buy a proportion of your eventual total each week/month until you have the amount you want? That way you smooth out any short term price fluctuations. You're right to think in terms of years, which will further reduce the impact of variations in your purchase price.
But in your situation: A thousand pounds isn't *that* much, and the UK political situation is such that you might want to just buy-in sooner rather than later. Who knows what Sterling will be worth in 2 months' time?

Private keys are intrinsic to bitcoin's inner working - addresses are derived from public keys, which are in turn derived from private keys. When you send a bitcoin transaction, you are really broadcasting a private-key-signed message to the network that says: "I, the former owner of this bitcoin, do let it be known that its new owner is the one who has the private key(s) associated with this* address" (*i.e. the address you are sending to).
The new owner has to send a similar message when they spend the bitcoin, but they will use *their* private key to sign it.

You believe halving the supply of new coins has no impact on price? Or are you playing a game with the word 'direct'?
Miners need to cover their costs, and most do this by selling a proportion of their reward. This constant obligatory selling exerts a downward pressure on price, and the halving means they have half as much btc with which to exert such pressure.
Every halving so far is correlated with a significant upward jump in price, as the system searches for a new equilibrium post pressure change. *You* are purely psychological.

But otherwise the answer is no.
Segwit is a soft fork, meaning old versions of bitcoin software will still be able to participate in the network, albeit without access to the new functionality. Currently, software checks newly created blocks to make sure they contain no more than than 1MB of transaction data &amp; associated cryptographic signatures.
Segwit pulls a trick whereby the transaction data adheres to this 1MB limit, while the signature data is moved elsewhere, freeing up more room for more transactions (it also does a bunch of other cool stuff, both fixes and future-feature-enabling changes).
Going over the 1MB limit for transaction data requires a hard fork, which for various reasons are worth avoiding if possible.
The thing to focus on isn't block size. Instead focus on transaction throughput capacity, which is surely the goal of big blocks. Currently Bitcoin can process ~3 transactions per second, whereas Visa (for example) is capable of over 50,000 per second.
Bigger blocks, capable of this sort of capacity, would be far too big to work in Bitcoin's p2p system, and so we need some other solution. Segwit enables tech such as Lightning, which stands a much better chance of scaling to Visa-esque levels.

Of all the mobile wallets I've used recently, the most impressive was Green Wallet.
But mobile wallets can never be very safe, since they load private keys into the same memory accessed by the OS. This means you should never store significant sums on them (or on ordinary desktop wallets, since they have the same problem).
If the amount of bitcoin is big enough to hurt if it gets stolen, you really should get a hardware wallet. These are designed to store the keys to your bitcoin safely, keeping them away from general purpose operating systems.

The bitcoin belongs to you, but space in the block chain doesn't.
We pay miners to keep a record of the *order* in which transactions are submitted to the blockchain. Each time you send bitcoin, you slip a small additional sum into the palm of a reliable witness and say- "hey man, if anyone asks, this here utxo was sent to the following address..." and the design of bitcoin means this small fee is sufficient incentive for the witness (i.e. the miner) to turn away later, conflicting claims about what happened to that same utxo.
Without this reliable record of what really transpired, I could send a utxo to someone, receive a good/service from them, and then send that same utxo elsewhere (perhaps to an address I control), and have that second transaction be the one that counts - it would be as if the first transaction never happened.

Owners are able to make provisions to pass private keys on to their beneficiaries of course.
But theoretically - at some point in the future it may be possible to find private keys which unlock lost coins. Assuming non-lost coins are able to be made safe, bitcoiners will have to decide whether to fork such that these 'recovered' coins are spendable or not.

Kinda! Usually proposed changes are discussed for extended periods before any code is written. And few would push ahead with coding a protocol modification which only secured e.g. 55% of users' support (and most of that 55% would back down once they realised how contentious the idea was) - most people want &gt;95% backing for changes, because of the risk of splitting the network.
Of course, many changes to the code base do not change the protocol (i.e. the rules embodied in the code), and these changes are much less difficult to institute.

I think you are working on too-small timescales. Nobody said the price would react on the same day - you have to look at multiple years of market data. As with previous halvenings elsewhere, it can take more than a year for the supply shock to be felt, and this delay only becomes longer when (as with litecoin) the system is more of a hobbyist/testnet undertaking than a working economy.

We'll range from $10k-ish at the start of the year, to over $40k by the end (and over $100k a year after that). Purely on that stock-to-flow model those German bankers found so compelling (because it is, relative to all the other noise).
But there's lots of uncertainty caused by bcash, whose halvening is currently on target to happen around the start of April, 5 weeks before bitcoin. I think this has a good chance of kick starting a wild bull market in bitcoin as the bcash hashrate evaporates, and suckers holding that coin suddenly realise they're in a scramble for the exit.

Say you own an asset. I borrow it from you for a defined period, in return for a fee/interest. I then sell your asset for, say $8k, on the understanding it will drop in price. When it hits e.g. $7k, I buy your asset back &amp; return it to you. I have made $1k minus your fee.

The word is 'drawer', you only need the private key, and if you're encrypting in a worthwhile way, you'll have the same safe storage problem with your password that you have with the private key.
Trezors are great, but not for the reasons many think. Long term storage is not why we need them. Instead, think of them as- 1) a safe way to generate keys (your PC being a flyblown wasteland of security holes), &amp; 2) a safe way to spend your bitcoin.
The thing you have to keep safe long term is your seed phrase - a list of 12 to 24 words, maybe with an additional password if you desire - and I recommend storing it on something like a thick bit of stainless steel, the words punched or ground into the surface.

I don't know of such a service, but to be honest- even if I could understand why it was better than you simply buying bitcoin with your profits (because of the fees lots of little tx would incur), I think exchanges would see it as a fraud/money laundering risk &amp; refuse to provide the service.

It's normal to worry! But in this instance you are fine. Regardless of how you store your private keys, you only incur tax (capital gains tax) when you exchange your bitcoin, either for another currency, or a commodity, or simply in a purchase.
Any such instances should be recorded in your tax return, but you do not have to pay anything on the first ~£12k or so (the amount goes up each year) of profit in a tax year.
If you're just storing your bitcoin long-term, you don't need to record this anywhere.

If a blockchain isn't primarily for securing/transferring/etc a native, value-bearing digital asset (i.e. Bitcoin), then it's a sham. Food, drugs, etc. may require databases, but blockchains are far from ideal for this purpose. In fact they're actively bad.

LN is easier to use than L1 bitcoin. Once we get to the stage that non-custodial usage is rock-solid &amp; risk-free, we'll see exchanges and similar transition to LN as the default.
I can't shake the idea that we need integration with browsers &amp; websites, so that it's as simple as installing an extension/add-on. I want to see, on every website, the option to switch off ads and instead automatically pay a small fraction of a penny per page (or per second of video, or whatever).

All in all an interesting read- The first part states the obvious somewhat (someone's got to!), but section 3 has analysis of a sort I've not seen before with regard to bitcoin.
It develops a (very) simple model to examine the relationship between monetary policy and bitcoin, and claims to show that the more open a government is to their citizens' involvement in bitcoin, the better the outcomes for all involved.
It is a *very* simple analysis, and I think some of the assumptions involved would come under heavy scrutiny from nocoiner skeptics, but as with the earlier topology section, you have to start somewhere.

Tether's just a tool to get fiat-denominated money onto/off of exchanges without banks fucking with you.
If banks didn't attempt to hinder/confound bitcoiners' transactions, Tether wouldn't exist.

@_date: 2019-10-18 17:12:02
Of course people would rather deal with banks - the point is trading's a fairly time-sensitive undertaking, whereby unexpected delays mean the difference between winning &amp; losing. Knowing this, and wanting to fuck with bitcoiners, banks were randomly holding up exchange-bound transactions, costing everyone a lot of money.
Tether was the response to this situation. That's all it is. I'm not saying it's legit (I've no idea), but all indications so far seem positive imho. They seem to be trying to run an honest operation, whose only problems have come as a result of bank/regulator fuckery.

It's the same private key.


Transactions on one chain can be 'replayed' on the other (meaning 'sent to the same new address'). So if you have a balance at the same address on both chains, you should more each to different addresses. If you only have bitcoin and the bcash address is empty, you don't need to worry or do anything.

Some questions I have, and would be very grateful if anyone could give me some pointers:
Is it possible (I don't mean 'right now', so much as mathematically) to encapsulate a master public key in a mnemonic, such that I can just hand over a seed phrase to a third party, which could generate new addresses for me?
Further, could I have different 'sub-master pubkeys' for different 3rd parties, such that *I* know who generated which address, but which, to anyone without the master private key, are unlinkable?
Any input gratefully received!
@_date: 2019-10-01 22:19:05
If you store your bitcoin with some 3rd party, you risk them absconding with your funds, getting hacked, or similar. The history of Bitcoin is rich with examples of this. For that reason, most recommend buying a hardware wallet (e.g. Trezor or ColdCard) for storing all but small sums.

Of the people who believe bitcoin is 'going to the moon' (i.e. making a 2025 self-kick likely), few believe it will be hanging around the $7k - $12k region for more than a year.

The difference between the two numbers you posted is 0.000006 bitcoins. At current exchange rates, this is equal to less than half of one US penny. (according to google, it's worth $0.004596 at the moment). So imho it's not worth worrying too much about.

The 1MB limit applies to the section of the block which stores transaction info.
Transaction info comes in two parts - 1) info about the transaction e.g. which coins are being spent where, and 2) proof that the owner of the coins was the one who spent them, known as the 'witness'.
Segwit was an upgrade which allowed witnesses to be stored in a different part of the block, where their size doesn't count towards the 1MB limit.
Segregating these witnesses is both normal cryptographic practice, and something which simplifies/facilitates a bunch of other features.

I consider it neither, and I consider it temporary. Whales can push the price around in the short term, but are not controlling the long term direction.
Bitcoin is still very small compared to other markets, but has this disproportionately newsworthy profile. These factors lead to the conditions that allow the short term movements that we see.
As bitcoin grows, the ability of individuals to affect the price shrinks (I hope I'm not being too obvious/patronising for you). Eventually, if bitcoin fulfils its potential, it will be the least manipulable/volatile market in history.

Blockchains are extremely inefficient. Like, that's *really* understating it. They have only been shown to be useful for one purpose, which is the recording of ownership/transfer/etc. of a **native, value-bearing token**.
(deep breath) The convoluted blockchain structure only exists to enable a paradigm whereby miners who compete to secure the chain are rewarded in the coin of the chain they're securing. That keeps them honest, see? They're disincentivised to pull shenanigans, because any hostile act devalues the reward they spend so much to pursue.

Your profit would be 10,000 minus 2,000 = £8,000. Since this is below the allowance, you do not need to pay any tax. But since you spent some, you are supposed to record this in a tax return.
Hypothetically the second- you buy £10k of bitcoin today. Three years later, it's worth £50k, and you decide to spend/exchange £30k's worth - 60% of your initial investment.
Your profit would be 30,000 minus 6,000 = £24,000. Since this is above the allowance, you need to pay any tax. First deduct the allowance, then pay 20% (or whatever the rate is by then) on the remainder.
As tax situations go, it's pretty simple.

Even though I'd used bitcoin a few times for payments, it was always in a 'get out quickly' way, since I was sure it didn't really hang together as a coherent system.
A love of codes &amp; puzzles forced me to keep investigating, but really I was hunting for the flaw that would allow me to say - "Ha! I knew it was nonsense!"
The moment where I fully understood the system for the first time was a bit like when you take a drink without looking in your glass, and it turns out to be beer instead of milk (or whatever). A visceral dissonance that resolved to something approaching delight.
I would say the important points are: Thinking about the the origins of money; Thinking about the modern banking system &amp; government monetary policies; Understanding bit torrent; Understanding principles of public key cryptography; &amp; understanding Nakamoto Consensus as a probabilistic solution to the Byzantine Generals' problem.
The most difficult &amp; worrying bit is how human society will change/react as bitcoin continues to grow. That shit is the bedrock of Bitcoin, and is kind of a black hole.

When a ledger is distributed, the question becomes how to reconcile disagreements between different participants about what is true. If half the network claims I sold you 10 hectolitres, and the other half says it was only 5, which side is telling the truth? In practice, we have to believe the person with the most guns/lawyers/money, otherwise they will crush us.
Bitcoin provides a solution, but it does so by binding the assurance given, to the reward for providing that assurance. If bitcoin miners tried to lie about bitcoin transactions, they would be destroying the value of their reward. So they are incentiveized to tell the truth. This can only work when the asset is native to the blockchain.
If you try to do the same with physical objects, there's nothing to stop reality diverging from the record on the blockchain. We are back to accepting what the person with the most guns/lawyers/money says.

But lightning enables a new class of payment paradigms. The internet is currently a surveillance tool, owing to the sorts of revenue streams sites have adopted.

It's not that you can *guarantee* specific prices, but that you can tip the odds decisively in your favour.
Imagine you are taking a risk that *should* be 50:50, but which because of your giant, market-moving stack is more like 60:40 in your favour- in this situation you have ceased gambling. You now know that after 10 trades, instead of ending up back where you started (as the risk you expose yourself to implies), you are statistically likely to be up ~20%. You don't need to win every bet, just more than you would naturally.
That's the edge whales have - they can decouple risk from reward slightly. The bigger the whale, the bigger the advantage in this regard.

Nothing *wrong*, but you miss: that you can reveal your public key while there are still funds associated with the corresponding private key; that habitual reuse could lead to lost funds (i.e. sender assumed receiver still has access to relevant private key); that signing multiple messages with the same private key opens avenues for potential attack that single-use does not.
You also fail to consider the privacy implications for other people with whom you transact - it's not just your own opsec you compromise.

They're basically minted by the miner when they mine a new block - the protocol allows them to include a transaction in that block sending a reward of newly created coins to an address they control.

Bitcoin was always likely to force banks to up their game (not saying this is wholly or even mostly due to BTC, but it exerts pressure none the less).
But the day-to-day usage side of things is not bitcoin's true quarry. Instead, we're going to make it much harder for corrupt/incompetent governments to rob us, undertake illegal wars, or wreck the world through rampant consumerism.

I'm glad you didn't end up out of pocket overall, even if you could've had more. But bitcoin isn't going away - whether you end up getting back in while it's still early, or when the majority climb aboard, it's definitely worth understanding the threats posed by modern tech to your privacy. It's a lesson you've already paid for, after all.

There's no such thing as a high security wallet that keeps your private keys in a normal PC environment.
Either use a hardware wallet to hold the keys, or use something like Electrum-on-TailsOS.
Anything else is too insecure* for anything but small sums. PCs (Windows or Mac) are just too hard to secure.

Each country gets to decide what investigative powers its law enforcement authorities are permitted to employ.
In many countries it's a free-for-all, with police able to demand info from companies without hindrance. Other countries ask that e.g. a judge is required to oversee a permission/warrant system. There may also be differences in scope - e.g. time-limited warrants, or the proscription of 'dragnet'-style fishing expeditions.
Of course, most countries also have a 'secret service' who are able to go much further, but their investigations are arguably less likely to result in a prosecution for you.

Make him an Electrum wallet or similar (I recommend using TailsOS for security, but you could do it on a pc/phone if necessary).

Miners are required to solve complex mathematical problems to mine a block. Some clever people discovered a shortcut to solving these problems, but it requires them to repurpose one of the fields in the blockheader (the nVersion field, used historically for 'signalling' e.g. readiness to apply a certain upgrade).
Bitcoin software sees that there's unexpected info in this field, and throws up a warning. The info expected in the field is not strictly necessary, so it doesn't make the block invalid or anything, it's just warning you that it looks like something unknown may be about to happen.

The problem is Blockchain using old, inefficient technology. Your transaction would likely have confirmed earlier today, even with such a small fee, had it been segwit-compatible.

For me he'd have to stand on his technical merits, but many would simply follow his word like a religion.
A big problem with Bitcoin is that it's built for the worst-case scenario, so cannot compete stats-wise with alts if the prevailing societal winds are favourable. Censorious governments would like nothing more than that we all jump over to bCash, scale on-chain, then get to a situation whereby enforcement of the rules can only be done from within a datacentre. Kicking in one of a dozen business' doors is much easier, politically, than raiding every house in the land.
I can see no scenario by which the return of Satoshi - whether he's a prick or a good guy - could be good for bitcoin. It *has* to be consensus-driven or it is worthless.

A hardware wallet. Trezor &amp; ColdCard are the current leaders. You use them to securely generate addresses, then send your bitcoin to those addresses.

No, there are few worse. If you have more than a few hundred bucks worth, you should use a method which keeps the private key away from an everyday operating system - Paperwallets (if used correctly), GreenAddress, Electrum-on-TailsOS, or a hardware wallet (Trezor or Ledger).
If it's small amounts, I like Electrum on Windows, and Samourai on Android (this is the best mobile wallet by some distance).
@_date: 2019-02-11 19:42:28
The seed is a set of 12 (or 24) words from which your HD wallet's master private key is derived. These words are drawn from a list of around 2000 words - you can't have a seed containing words not on the list.
The password is a 13th (or 25th) word which does not need to be drawn from the list, and is optional. I don't use Electrum on windows, but there may be an additional/separate password used to encrypt the wallet file on-disk.
If the password is this latter kind, you won't need it to access your coins if you do find the seed phrase.

@_date: 2019-02-14 13:18:13
It's not safe, but I'd accept it if I was e.g. selling cups of coffee. But safety is a journey rather than a destination. 'Safe enough' is what you need to think about.
To cheat you, a customer would have to attempt a 'double spend' - i.e. using the same UTXO in two different transactions. This isn't easy, and would not be worth it for many situations (though something like a large purchase of Monero would be a different matter).
Even without a single confirmation, the chances of a double spend drop quite quickly with time, since the point is to try to get the second, rogue transaction seen by miners before the first, honest one.
Once you have your first confirmation, and can see that the block is not likely to become an orphan, you can trust it quite a bit more. For large transactions, it's quite rare that the customer *needs* to run off quickly, so waiting 6 or so confirmations puts the payment beyond reasonable doubt (you'd have to be dealing with a large &amp; naughty miner/government/etc conspiracy to lose out).
The confidence bar you linked seems to allow some % gain for age of tx (representing the removed risk of double-spends) over about a minute or so - presumably thinking the tx will have propagated to the majority of nodes by that time. I'm watching a few transactions and there seems to be a bit of complexity in how they model it, so it would be guess-work beyond 'time plus confirmations'. Fees, mempool size, segwit use, etc may all come into consideration
@_date: 2019-10-29 19:39:53

If your shopify store doesn't sell anything that governments are trying to prohibit, then a centralised solution makes much more sense right now.

I have a website not a million miles away from 'arts &amp; crafts', with bitcoin accepted since 2013. My experience is that the target audience for such things does not overlap significantly with the bitcoin crowd yet...
If I were you, I'd set up a page telling customers that if they want to pay in bitcoin, they can drop you a message. Many wallets will generate QR code invoices for specific amounts. This will be less work for you than integration with shopify's closed system, and by the time bitcoin payments are more frequent btcpay server's integration will be complete.

"Lightning" Network. You make it sound like we are a collective for bleaching each others' assholes.
LN is basically a way to stop writing every transaction to the blockchain, and instead lets us only write the net result of those transactions.
Say one day you &amp; I do a bunch of business. I pay you 10 btc for something, then you pay me 7btc. Then I pay you 12, then you pay me 20 (imagine this exchange goes on for dozens of transactions). LN allows us to operate a tab, and only settle up on-chain once we're finished transacting. This saves fees &amp; block space.
The really cool thing is that LN hooks *everyone* together in that tab, so it's not restricted to 2 parties.

Your PC is likely compromised. Nothing to do with Electrum, everything to do with how you use it.
For significant sums, you must use Electrum with a hardware wallet (or something like Electrum on TailsOS, which is free and comparably secure, but slightly less convenient).
Any time your private keys are exposed to a general-purpose computing environment, you should regard them as burned &amp; move your btc immediately.

Bitcoin mining difficulty adjusts every 2 weeks or so. Bcash's difficulty adjustment algorithm was designed to cause as much chaos to Bitcoin as possible, and has had a negligible effect thus far.
Are we to believe that was the plan all along? To appear to be incompetent attackers, then turn the tables months later? There comes a point where the only people still asking such questions are the gullible fools upon whom these scammers are preying.

Is that really for you to judge, in a Dunning–Kruger way?
Being closed source introduces an unknown into the safety equation. It means you cannot compare security levels with open equivalents, since some of the things you need to assess are hidden.
The best you can do is consider the history of closed source projects, and try to determine whether the practice of restricting access to code results in fewer exploitable bugs or not. The answer might surprise you.

We've already established that you're paying to use on-chain transactions to wallets (that's how the discussion started). This is about minimising fees.

With a halvening due in less than a year, I'd say the price stands a good chance of increasing in the medium term. There may still be short-term drops related to news/events, however.

Sure thing!
The reason many of us are so interested in Bitcoin is that it removes the ability of governments to devalue currency - essentially robbing its own citizens - to make up for mistakes it has made (at best), or to participate in smash-and-grab scams like the 2008 financial crisis. In many countries, peoples' life savings have been wiped out multiple times by such means.
In the very first block in the blockchain - the "Genesis Block" - Bitcoin's creator inserted the following text:


This is a quote from The Times newspaper (from the UK), and points to the fact that Bitcoin is intended to prevent such outrageous behaviour.
The idea that Bitcoin would be 'blown out of the water' by a government-controlled coin - one subject to the same manipulations as all other government-issued currency - misunderstands why we value it to begin with.
(Long but vital reading on why the 2008 financial crisis was so egregious is available here -  - It's the most important story of the last 30 years imho, and almost nobody is aware of it)

They're almost always within 1.5% of the market rate (when I posted they were ~1.3% above), but yep, caveat emptor. It's private sellers who decide the price, and sometimes there aren't enough online to ensure a competitive rate.
Outside of such times (which are often associated with market volatility), you will struggle to get better rates for trades below 1BTC.

The hilarious truth is that there's little good data.
The best/most recent study I've seen was conducted by, iirc, Bitfury some time ago (ages in Bitcoin time). I don't have a link right now, I'm away from home for a while. But it showed that an increase from 4MB limit (as now) to an 8MB limit (as 2X proposes) could kick 95% of nodes off the network within 6 months.
I think the point hasn't attracted much serious study because the answer is pretty obvious, once you've immersed yourself in the way the system works. Not only are we clearly on the edge of making nodes too onerous to run, but there is no future in scaling with bigger blocks.
Bigger blocks offer only incremental change, when we need orders of magnitude. So it's not only dangerous, it's a dead end.

A short is when you think an asset is going to fall in price, so you borrow it, sell it, then buy it back once the price has fallen to return to the person who lent it to you. If the price fell, you pocket the difference (minus fees).

The value is determined by interactions between buyers and sellers.
Someone with millions could definitely make a small &amp; temporary change, but if the goal is to push the price down, you'd be better off avoiding trading for this - your money would go much further if spent on forks, astroturfing, and buying up as much of the ecosystem as you can.

Haha, that would be more interesting, though a pre-1.0 forever stance is unlikely. Assuming 'dickhead' means 'will introduce crowd-pleasing changes that break the careful equilibrium of incentives and limitations necessary for Bitcoin to fulfil its purpose'... 
There would definitely be a split - there are enough people in the space already who approach it as a religion, rather than on technical merits. They'd support changes which gave the new coin a big advantage over Bitcoin in some respect, but which came at the expense of some other aspect (though this downside would not initially manifest as a tangible problem).
Many Bitcoiners will understand the issues &amp; maintain Bitcoin in the face of this attack, but if a majority are swayed by dickhead-Satoshi it would be a very big setback.
I kinda view 99.9% of altcoins in this light. They all give up some crucial aspect of Bitcoin in exchange for a temporary advantage, hoping people will jump onboard before it all comes grinding to a halt.

The basic idea is - 
Move your bitcoin to a new wallet. Use the keys from the old, empty bitcoin wallet in a Bcash wallet to send your Bcash to an exchange (changelly works well for one-off trades, no registration required), and swap for bitcoin, which you send to the new wallet you created in step one.

Apologies for the length of this, which I've posted before. You can't really understand 2x without this background. But it explains why 'attack' is the appropriate term.
Bitcoin devs came up with a cool bit of tech to improve Bitcoin (Segwit - it increases capacity &amp; makes a bunch of new features easy to implement). Unbeknown to those devs, this improvement inadvertently neutralised a neat trick the largest miner had come up with to make his mining more efficient (which equals more profit). This same miner had for some time harboured ambitions to rule Bitcoin. He was putting tens of millions into infrastructure, unlike users/devs/etc, and couldn't understand why he wasn't consequently in charge of the whole system.
He hatched a plan intended to stall the implementation of Segwit, a plan which over time grew to include the goal of displacing the open/decentralised dev structure, and installing himself as king. He met with some Bitcoin devs in Hong Kong, agreeing to implement segwit if the devs would also code-up a change from 1MB to 2MB blocks. Under this proposal, Segwit would be a soft fork, and the 2MB bump would happen as a hard fork if it gained the support of the users. The devs began coding for segwit, but support for the 2MB hard fork was absent (the downsides far outweigh any benefit - users saw that 2MB blocks make it easier for a ruling class to install itself). The miner, rich on his secretly buffed profits, embarked on a spending spree. He bought healthy stakes in many of the most prominent players in the Bitcoin ecosystem (who changed overnight from user-supporting to miner-supporting positions). He also attracted certain individuals who own lots of bitcoin, and who also long for Bitcoin to acquire a ruling class.
Angered by the community's refusal to accede to his 2MB fork, and eager to continue to enjoy his secret buff, the miner came out against Segwit (which had been designed to be activated by the miners). Together the wannabe-bosses began building a largely faked support (there exists much evidence of huge paid-for tweeting programmes and the like - there's actual billions at stake remember). Some useful idiots, unable to see how Bitcoin works and easily swayed by tough-talking strongmen, were swept along. Around 20% of the apparent user base is now aligned with the miner.
With segwit still not implemented, one user devised a way to organise the power of all users to force the miners to implement segwit - this method was named "UASF" (or BIP148). It was well constructed, and scared the miner into meeting with his aspiring courtiers in New York, where they came up with "Segwit2X", a counter-plan to activate Segwit 'on their terms', which is tied to a 2MB hard fork as per their previous scheme. The miner's new plan was poorly conceived, widely judged to be simultaneously an attempt to further forestall segwit, install a ruling class, and prove the miners' power in the face of the upstart (from their perspective) UASF.
The UASF succeeded. To save face and inflict petulant damage on Bitcoin, the miner then paid for the creation of a new coin (Bcash) forked from Bitcoin, marketed as 'the real Bitcoin', and quickly rejected by users (today it has the same number of tx in a day that Bitcoin has in 10 minutes). But at least we now have segwit. To nobody's great surprise, the miner and his acolytes are now pushing ahead with the 2MB part of their Segwit2X plan, and that's where we are today. They could easily fork from their own Bcash chain in a far less dramatic way, but their current plan is to fork from Bitcoin in a deliberately destructive way, which this analogy attempts to illustrate:
Imagine some sorcerer could have every American wake up one day to find that each dollar bill they'd owned at bed time had been joined in their wallets by a wizardly duplicate. Seems great, but you discover that everything you do with the wizardbucks is magically enacted on your real dollars too (e.g. you sell/spend/bin them and your real $$$ disappears also). Additionally they're so hard to distinguish from the real $$$ that people accidentally use/accept one instead of the other.
All we have to do is ignore the wizardbucks, but people are scared easily, this shit's complicated, and the wizard has a fake grassroots campaign in place already.

Of course it would, just as losing all your bitcoin would be terrible.
Bitcoin is, comparatively, the wild west. Even insured-to-the-hilt, blue chip offerings have *some* risk, and remember - if bitcoin really does moon, it's likely this will be accompanied by a crumbling of the very same legacy-financial-industry systems through which promises of insurance/risk mitigation purport to be delivered.
You could easily be left with nothing. If bitcoin fulfils its potential, I'd go so far as to say it's likely.

At inception there were 0 coins, so that isn't true.
But to address the point you're trying to make - even if the private keys to all but a single satoshi are lost, Bitcoin will work just fine.

It's not necessary for a wallet to 'run' anywhere, it can exist without ever having been on any kind of computer. It sounds like a Trezor would be a good idea in your situation. Otherwise:
You'll know which of your environments (windows or android) is more secure. For me it would definitely be Android, for which I'd recommend Samourai. Otherwise, I'd download tailsOS ( create an electrum wallet, and export the master public key to a phone wallet. Worst case, I'd trust a normal electrum wallet (i.e. on windows) more than Jaxx.
With this second method, you are roughly equally secure as with a hardware wallet, plus you can view your stash &amp; generate new receiving addresses with no fear of your coins being stolen.

6 confirmations = effectively irreversible. An hour is not long to wait for that amount of certainty, but some payments just don't need it.
The security of LN follows quite a different model, and can not be considered as safe as 6 confirmations (or even 1). But it's safe enough (in my estimation) for 95% of current transactions, while opening the possibility of entirely new types of transaction - fractions of pennies for webpage clicks, or per-second video streaming paid for in real time, or IoT-style economies.

What a hilarious tangle they get themselves into. He claims to think a centralised, cargo-cult bitcoin would be bad because the plebs could use it to escape a collapsing bank.
Assuming for a moment that such escape routes *are* a bad thing - a centrally-controlled currency could simply stop people from withdrawing from a struggling bank.
He can't be so stupid as to miss this point, so my guess is that this is a thinly-disguised panic/warning about bitcoin. He's really saying "If we don't find some way to stop bitcoin, we won't be able to make the public pay up when our gambling debts are due".

Hash rate is the thing that secures the network. So if you halve the difficulty (i.e. double the frequency of blocks), all you do is make each block worth 50% less in terms of confidence/surety.
There *are* benefits to the faster 'first confirmation', but they are more than made up for by the downsides (bloat, geographic concentration of miners as latency forms an increasing part of the interval between blocks, etc.). 10 mins is adjudged to be the sweet spot in terms of what Bitcoin tries to accomplish.

It varies by wallet, and again, some (I'm looking at you, Bread) have taken wilfully confusing stances.
The basic deal is that the private keys (stored in your ledger) that are needed to spend your bitcoin are *identical* to the private keys needed to spend your 2X coin (and your Bcash, for that matter). So it's simply a matter of opening a ledger-compatible wallet on each network, and spending the respective coins.
The situation with 2X is complicated by the lack of replay protection on that coin's network. A dick-move by the devs, that kinda makes it obvious that they're not 'good actors'. Because of this, you will likely have to perform a one-off 'coin-splitting' manoeuvre, whereby you simultaneously transact on both the bitcoin and 2x networks. Services to help make this easy are under development, and will be widely publicised when the time comes (there's no rush to do so, but you might wish to sell one asap).

You're a little confused - nodes benefit you by allowing you to ensure you are not getting cheated. It's miners - specifically the security they provide - that faces problems owing to the disappearance of the block reward.
The honest answer is 'nobody knows'. Satoshi's scheme involves the establishment of a healthy fee market, which is intended to replace the block reward long term.

Forget about Bcash. It's a scam.
As to your question, think of it like this: To be a currency, a coin needs to be very widely adopted. I'm talking about a high degree of saturation of the general population &amp; businesses.
Such adoption happens according to an 's-curve', and for bitcoin, we're still in the early stages of the initial 'bend upwards'. If BTC continues as it has, we will next experience an almost vertical phase wherein adoption rates peak, followed by a gradual flattening out, as stragglers finally get on-board.
It is not until this final phase that bitcoin can be used as a currency. But until then, there's no reason it can't be used/seen/defined/called a speculative asset, a store of value, or similar.
These are early days, don't assume they characterise all future use of bitcoin.

Bitcoin is not inherently unstable. The greater a proportion of the world's economy it captures, the more stable its purchasing power will be.
In fact bitcoin has the potential to become the most stable currency in history, owing to its ability to be used across a greater range of use cases, geographies, and cultures than anything that has gone before.

All of that can be trivially achieved without a blockchain. Once you have a central authority, you don't need (and would actively avoid) the huge penalties the tech imposes.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:28:55
Fair enough. The lack of quality devs is directly related to the choice of scaling model - those smart enough work on this stuff can see straight away that it's backing the wrong conceptual horse. And if you have the skills and you're going to work for bad guys, banks pay much better.
I actually think a centralised coin could do well (it's pointless using a blockchain though), but the leadership has to be the exact opposite of those behind Bcash.

The network effect is likely too strong, and any altcoin feature strong enough to overcome this could/would be incorporated into Bitcoin. But it's a series of trade-offs, by and large. e.g.:


Were LTC to find itself in this position, services such as those offering to store data in its blocks would spring up, it's blockspace would become more congested, and we'd be back to where we are with bitcoin, except the large blocks would have centralised the network to a potentially dangerous extent.

No, there's a pin you type.
Trezors store your keys within very secure environments - they are used to store keys 'on behalf of' desktop and phone wallets, wherein the keys are otherwise only as secure as the device's operating system.
Web based wallets are another layer of insecurity on top of that - best case scenario you're exposed to more attacks. Worst case, you don't even control your own private keys, so the site could be hacked/go bust/turn crooked and you'd have no bitcoin anymore.
It's needless risk for all but the smallest sums.

He's a well-known shiller. His argument ground to a halt fairly early in the piece, when he explained his theory is predicated on a belief in:


Bcash's 'scaling' solution has been known not to work for years. The blocks become too big to work in a decentralised network, centralisation occurs, then there is no use for a blockchain. At that point you can run everything off a hefty server, and (at least until the government closes it down) you are the king of a less user-friendly paypal competitor.

Bitcoin is a 'bearer' instrument - whoever holds it can spend it. The bitcoin protocol/code is not the problem here, but it does require a change in mindset on the part of the bitcoin user. Security is both hard to do well, and vital. Many of the people who own bitcoin today are doing so insecurely because they don't understand what's required. Their coins may be stolen, in the same way someone who stores gold bullion in a bucket on their front lawn might experience. Get a hardware wallet.
Exchanges are a necessary evil right now, but will play an increasingly minor part in the future. They *are* a problem, though again, it's not a fault in Bitcoin per se. Never store bitcoin on an exchange, only use the most reputable ones (gemini in the US, bl3p.eu in Europe, is my assessment), and get good at 2fa.

Prior to the update yesterday, the app's own description (as seen from the Google app site) claimed it set up 'a Bitcoin Cash wallet as default'.

@_date: 2017-11-01 22:16:44
No. The difficulty adjusts to keep the blocks around 10 mins apart on average. There's no benefit to making them more frequent - each block becomes worth proportionately less in 'certainty' terms, so you still have to wait the same amount of time for the same degree of confirmation, and the downsides are considerable (much more bandwidth required which kills decentralisation, plus increased orphan rates, geo-concentration of miners, etc.).
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:35:47

It does, though it does a funny thing that I actually asked the devs about, whereby it matches your change address to the payment address - the effect is that if you have all-segwit utxos, and pay some bitcoin to a legacy address, the change will end up at a legacy address too (and vice versa).
It's done for good privacy-focused reasons, but I'd really like to be able to disable that feature on a per-tx basis.

The big one that's leading this video guy astray is that he only has a superficial understanding of the way bitcoin nodes/miners work together.

Lots is planned. Right now, given what we know of the centralising pressure bigger blocks would exert, all focus is on making more efficient use of the space we can safely work with.
Once that angle of attacking the scaling problem is exhausted, there will be so called 'layer 2' solutions. But if we get to a point whereby the only way forward is another block size bump, and if it's safe/necessary (to be judged subjectively by users), then a block size bump will be very likely.
Focus less on block size, and more on safe scaling *by any means*.

There is a huge excess of nodes. We might need to incentivise more if this stops being true, but there's no sign of that. It's simply not the problem you imagine.

You need to use the private key that stores your bitcoin in order to spend your Bcash. In which case, if you're smart, you'll regard that key as 'burned', and ensure your bitcoin are secured by a different key before you type it in to a bcash wallet.

Right now the hashrate is about 44 million Th/s.
But hashes are not really anything to do with wallets. Each hash is like a single guess, made by a miner trying to find a valid solution for the next block.
Blocks contain transactions, and finding one grants a reward of 12.5 new bitcoin.
Wallets are the bits of software we use to manage our private keys, they do not get involved with hashrate.

Fees aren't related to difficulty. They're just bids for block space.
The only way to make fees go down (assuming a steady rate of transactions) is to increase the amount of block space, or to reduce the amount of block space each transaction takes up. But we're currently at the limit of what the system can handle, extra space-wise, without compromising decentralisation.
Happily, inventions like Lightning Network are starting to come online (check out  which make it possible to make *many* essentially fee-free micro &amp; macro transactions for the cost (and block space requirement) of two transactions.
This will revolutionise Bitcoin, and hopefully reduce the amount of time I spend undoing the effects of big-blocker FUD.

Their employees have been repeatedly caught 'insider trading' - loading up on shitcoins that they knew (but the public didn't) were about to be offered via coinbase, with the corresponding price pump that entails. You go to jail for that in some industries.

It's a good question. No doubt Bitcoin's march could be hindered or even stalled if governments band together to stop it.
But Bitcoin is an idea whose time has come. Even if you ignore the bank bailouts and other abuses governments now regularly indulge in, Bitcoin - native digital money - is a huge improvement over the legacy system going forward. So while I don't underestimate the deleterious effect government action could have, I do think it would be temporary for a number of reasons:
Firstly, such an illiberal move would not pass without widespread resistance - governments aren't tolerated just to be strict nannies, Victorian fathers, or Nurse Ratched style characters. They are supposed to be in our employ, administrative functionaries who handle the small stuff so we're free to live life. No doubt they can &amp; do push up to the line, sometimes beyond it, sometimes for decades. But as I said, this is an idea whose time has come. As populations realise the benefits they're missing out on, pressure will grow on such illiberal governments. Some of us keep our guillotines sharpened &amp; ready for just such an occasion.
Secondly, it's essentially impossible to get *every* country on board, so some places would still be free, and free to enjoy the benefits, conspicuously, while the btc-banning countries stagnate.
Thirdly, consider the war on drugs. I am not saying an equivalent situation for Bitcoin would be good or anything. But as cash disappears, people are going to need currency that can't be controlled. Worst case, the illicit/shadow economy becomes a reservoir, sustaining the project while legislative fads chill wider use.
tl;dr- they can fuck with bitcoin temporarily, but I don't see how they can do more than forestall the inevitable.

It's all about bitcoin that are sent to you. If you are due to receive a payment, and you verify it with your own node, you are setting the rules. If someone tries to send you a payment following different rules, you simply don't receive it. They still owe you.
The proliferation of UASF nodes was an economic majority loudly warning certain businesses/miners 'if you attempt to follow different rules, your payments to us will not arrive, you'll instead have sent yourself off into another system that doesn't include us (the economic majority).'
Miners don't want to expend resources mining worthless coins, since that would constitute lost revenue. Businesses want to be on the same network as their customers, or they are no longer their customers. So they wisely stayed in consensus with users.

@_date: 2017-11-29 15:41:05
Jaxx is a poor choice, even among desktop wallets. If you've got more than a few hundred dollars worth, it's essential that you put it somewhere secure. Go for a properly set up paper wallet, a GreenAddress wallet, electrum-on-TailsOS, or a hardware wallet. All but the latter are free.
Hardware wallets (Trezor or Ledger - no others are trustworthy yet) are great, especially if you're sending many transactions. You use them through a software wallet. All they do is hold your private keys securely, and sign transactions they are asked to by the software wallet.

How are you going to store the password for the encrypted volume?

My guess is that you imported into your main wallet a private key from the 'other' wallet.

I don't necessarily agree with him, but if I was an exodus user, I would be interested to see how this plays out. The ban was automatic rather than specific to OP's claim.
OP links to a verified member of Exodus staff saying 'no KYC needed with our service', and has an experience which contradicts this. Exodus have been around long enough that they should be able to deal with this appropriately, and that doesn't appear to have happened yet. Either they acknowledge that KYC may sometimes be required (in contradiction of their public assertion), or find fault with OP's story.

As things played out, the most you could say was you scared the anti-segwit people into behaving themselves. Had they persisted with their plan to refuse the upgrade, you would then have had to put your money where your mouth was.


But if they were running nodes following anti-segwit rules, your economic power would've been counted as standing against the upgrade. You would *not* be verifying by Bitcoin's definition of the term, but rather trusting *their* version of events. The same goes for every other 3rd party.
You might say 'oh, come on - they wouldn't *all* tell me the wrong thing!'
Bitcoin is built to work when exactly that is happening.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:05:28
Since a few new posters have appeared, each focusing on this point, I have prepared an answer to copy &amp; paste for you- please share it among yourselves:
It's a good question. No doubt Bitcoin's march could be hindered or even stalled if governments band together to stop it.
But Bitcoin is an idea whose time has come. Even if you ignore the bank bailouts and other abuses governments now regularly indulge in, Bitcoin - native digital money - is a huge improvement over the legacy system going forward. So while I don't underestimate the deleterious effect government action could have, I do think it would be temporary for a number of reasons:
Firstly, such an illiberal move would not pass without widespread resistance - governments aren't tolerated just to be strict nannies, Victorian fathers, or Nurse Ratched style characters. They are supposed to be in our employ, administrative functionaries who handle the small stuff so we're free to live life. No doubt they can &amp; do push up to the line, sometimes beyond it, sometimes for decades. But as I said, this is an idea whose time has come. As populations realise the benefits they're missing out on, pressure will grow on such illiberal governments. Some of us keep our guillotines sharpened &amp; ready for just such an occasion.
Secondly, it's essentially impossible to get every country on board, so some places would still be free, and free to enjoy the benefits, conspicuously, while the btc-banning countries stagnate.
Thirdly, consider the war on drugs. I am not saying an equivalent situation for Bitcoin would be good or anything. But as cash disappears, people are going to need currency that can't be controlled. Worst case, the illicit/shadow economy becomes a reservoir, sustaining the project while legislative fads chill wider use.
tl;dr- they can fuck with bitcoin temporarily, but I don't see how they can do more than forestall the inevitable.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:38:08

It has no real devs, no users, and no scaling plan. It's centralised, and will surely become formally so.
You might argue that a centralised coin could beat Bitcoin, and nobody can see the future of course. But it would then be susceptible to a competitor running on a couple of servers, with none of the inefficiency of a blockchain.

@_date: 2017-11-23 07:52:51
Oh yeah, there's no serious problem. The keys are derived from the same seed and such. It's just that, if every wallet behaved this way, we could struggle to realise even half of the space-saving benefits of segwit.
They're good people and the feature is implemented that way for solid reasons. I just wish I could manually override is all.

You misunderstand. If you hold your own private keys, you get the fork coin automatically (*not* from coinbase).
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:47:19
You don't need to do anything, but:
Some people are making a fork of bitcoin, and as part of this, you receive 1 "2X coin" for each bitcoin you own. It's nothing to do with Coinbase, and you can ignore their message. If you want to sell your 2X coins for bitcoin (more bitcoin!), you need to read up on how to do it - don't send any transactions post-fork until you've done your homework.
You should probably move your coins such that *you alone* control the private keys. E.g., send your coins to a paper wallet, hardware wallet, or Electrum-on-TailsOS, for instance. This is good advice at any time, but especially before a fork.
@_date: 2019-12-04 18:35:24

@_date: 2019-12-28 14:15:31
In the UASF's case, it was the *threat* of businesses/miners being on the wrong side of a fork that did the job. The users were saying 'if you don't support segwit, we will exclude you from the ecosystem', and it worked. The threat was powerful enough that it didn't even get to the stage of a forked chain. The other side capitulated before the point that transactions would have made a difference.
@_date: 2019-12-30 15:35:04


The internet remembers forever, and Satoshi was trying to build something that would work. At times some of their decisions (such as this one, to guard their identity well) seem almost implausibly clear-sighted. But here we are.


I was attracted to Bitcoin by the ingeniousness of the mechanism by which bitcoin hangs together - once I understood Nakamoto consensus (which I learned about in order, I imagined, to show why it didn't work) I was hooked. For other people the motivating factor might be bitcoin crossing the $100k mark. We're all energised by different things.
I agree that it's hard to be interested without solid information to hang your thoughts upon, but I don't get the relevance of the creator's identity. Learn about bit torrent, public key cryptography, Merkle trees, game theory, macroeconomics and the like. That's the interesting stuff.
@_date: 2019-12-04 22:27:33
People missed out on getting up to 0.2 bitcoin per bcash token (!!!), all because the coinbase CEO wanted to try to take down bitcoin. He was basically gambling using their money. Mad hubris.
And forgetting the gainz aspect, not being able to dump airdrop tokens when they embody an attack on your assets must've been extremely frustrating. Though on second thoughts, anyone switched on enough to think like that probably didn't use coinbase by that point.

Exchanges without fees.
It's a centralised coin with a broken concept of scaling, a paucity of competent devs, no real users, and a group of leaders (it's centralised remember) who've shown themselves to be crooks &amp; shysters.
Even if somebody believes in bitcoin-but-with-onchain-scaling, Bcash is too toxic to serve as their 'one true coin'.
But because of fee-free exchanges, a couple of rich guys can make it pump &amp; dump, over and over, essentially forever. Ignore it &amp; focus on something cool.

Obviously. Bitcoin wouldn't be necessary if people like this agreed with its objectives.
@_date: 2019-12-31 00:21:53
We will have to pay more in fees than we do now for on-chain transactions, that's the way it's supposed to work.
However with layer 2 solutions like LN, each on-chain transaction might represent hundreds or even thousands of day-to-day payments. So it could be that each transaction gets cheaper, even as we pay more for writing to the base layer.

@_date: 2017-11-15 13:50:58


No - it's because more people want to buy btc than sell it. This causes more miners to want to mine it, not the other way around.


None of the alts are better than btc in my opinion, and if any alt had some killer feature that made it more attractive, bitcoin could simply implement an equivalent feature. With a huge userbase advantage, bitcoin would win that contest.
Most alts don't have credible dev support. Of those that do, there are some that do cool stuff bitcoin doesn't, but they always come at a cost bitcoin users have deemed unacceptable. E.g. ethereum doesn't scale well and is fundamentally insecure. Monero doesn't scale well and requires continued emission of coins.
Everything is a trade-off, and most people believe Bitcoin has the balance closest to 'right'.

It *will* always be this way, or variations on it. And the thing is, it's targeted at newcomers. The whole point is to scam people. Once you've been around long enough (unless you're really dim, corrupt, or very greedy), it doesn't even register anymore.

If I understand you correctly, the answer is "don't use 2fa tied to phone numbers". A great many people have lost bitcoin this way.

Since miners' costs are not settled in btc, this isn't a great riposte. Truth is, it would be *great* if fees for on-chain tx could be negligible, the bare minimum needed to fund sufficient hash power/discourage spam.
The problem is that bitcoin is growing its user base faster than its user-handling capacity. It's a victim of its own success. Not the worst problem to have, but a problem none the less. Solutions cannot come soon enough.

I didn't mean to provoke such anger, apologies for that.
Bitcoin is in its infancy. A cost of admission to these early stages, for anyone wishing to reap the associated benefits, is a requirement to keep pace with the technology's on-going development.
At some point soon, much of these inner workings will no longer be exposed, having been abstracted away by services &amp; devices that take care of that detail for you.
Think how hard it was to use the internet (such as it was) in the 1980s. Such complex systems do not spring into existence fully formed and noob-proofed, sad to say.

The main threat appears to be a critical mass of the economic activity being persuaded to forsake bitcoin's hardness/uncensorability.
It might happen through violence, but I think it will be much easier all around just to trick people into thinking it's to their benefit. Promise riches, security, or similar, and the userbase of the future (unlikely to grok the technical restrictions which enable bitcoin's core properties, and less ideologically driven) may well be fooled.
Of course there would be those of us who would resist, and bitcoin is mighty well designed to facilitate that. But... if bitcoin's somehow in wide use among the general public, anything could happen. Those fuckers are crazy.
To prevent this possible future, every user has to become *instinctively* defensive of bitcoin's core properties - permissionlessness, censor-resistance, and hardness. We have to learn to identify threats to these, as automatically as a dog reacts to another dog, trying to make off with its lunch. Because that's what it is - someone stealing from you a basic freedom. Bitcoin is the greatest, purest articulation of the concept of value in human history, and we must make understanding this universal human knowledge, or allow that epochal advancement to be erased.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:50:07


You can, but it's not as sound a test.


Your reasoning sounds broadly correct. Assuming Electron Cash works with multibit's seed format (easily confirmed if you have both installed), I'd check the same addresses on each blockchain. If you can see your BCH in the old multibit addresses, you can try again with the seed words (getting them slightly wrong should fail the checksum, so you should be able to tell if they're right), or try to import the specific private keys.

The 'usual' fee has been a couple of pennies for over a year. Punctuated by occasional (like, less than 2% of the time) need to pay ~20p if your in a hurry. 50 to 80 times less seems implausible. This current low cost is how it normally is.
In truth, I would be much more comfortable if fees *were* 50 times higher than usual, though I think we'll need LN and other layer 2 solutions to become more robust before many would agree.

14 days unless rebroadcast, but other things can change that - e.g. (some/any of) the tx's inputs are used in a different tx that *does* confirm.
There's also a max mempool size, and your tx could fall off the bottom if sufficient txs pay better fees (worth noting that there's no single canonical mempool, only lots of local versions).
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:13:52
The article pretends it's *only* blockstream who believe 4MB max block size is at the upper limit of what can be considered safe right now, and *only* because their business plan anticipates this.
In reality, ~85% of users (and a great many businesses) are in agreement with the company you single out, and it's nothing to do with making money. It's about preserving decentralisation, the only thing that makes Bitcoin worth anything.
The very moment careful analysis demonstrates that bigger blocks are both safe &amp; necessary, I and the vast majority of those opposing them will gleefully jump aboard that ship.

Assuming you mean monetary value - Temporarily, definitely. Long-term, I don't believe so, for the reasons I gave above.
Any centrally-controlled coin can do many things *better* than Bitcoin. The requirement to use a blockchain, and to do so in a way that guarantees censorship resistance, is a massive hindrance. A govt. coin could have instant confirmations, trillions of transactions per second, etc. The problem is, it could also be devalued/censored/controlled, which is what we're trying to get away from.
(I should say, I'm no libertarian - I like 'big states' in a number of ways. I just believe that the evidence is in when it comes to monetary policy: It's not something we can trust to governments, sadly.)

I don't use ledger so I'm not sure what will work for you (you should be fine), but many wallets have the ability for you to set a 25th word, like a password on your seed. And it doesn't have to come from the standard word list, it can be anything.
So you can be a bit less crazy with your seed phrase hiding place, and keep your more innocuous looking 25th word elsewhere. The *really* cool thing is that your 24 word seed still opens a wallet, just not your password-protected one. So you can store a plausible amount there as something to give up under duress, protecting your real stash from the $5 wrench/rubber hose/etc. attack.

That's not a bitcoin wallet, it is part of a scam that exists to make money from people who have no idea what they're doing.
You should be able to recover your bitcoin though. You need to import the private key from 'Electron Cash' into a bitcoin wallet. If you don't have someone trustworthy to walk you through the process, then you will need to bring yourself up to speed on bitcoin.

Monero is a very interesting experiment with a decent community, but ignoring the serious issues regarding auditability, has never looked like it could scale even to bitcoin's modest throughput without sacrificing its decentralization.
Had Bitcoin launched with Monero's design it would have fizzled out in about 2013 as, following the boom in DNMs, operations would be forced to relocate to datacentres (and would consequently have been shut down).

Both fiat and cryptocurrencies are ultimately underpinned by groups of people who find them useful. The difference is that I've chosen to use Bitcoin because it has qualities I value, whereas fiat is foist upon me by virtue of location, no choice about it.

TailsOS is specially hardened to run in precisely the scenario you are aiming for. They've done all the hard work. Just boot from a live CD (or USB stick), generate a seed, note it &amp; some addresses down, then restart. Super secure.
You can also export the master public key, and install that in e.g. a phone wallet. The private keys are not present, so it's totally secure in that regard, but you can see your funds &amp; generate new receiving addresses.

So that out of the way, you then hypothesise that one participant in this economy decides to trash it - oh no! - what then, Bitcoiners???
Well, you have to explain what this has to do with bitcoin. China could easily play such games right now, if it wanted.

However, the basic thrust of the joke is that, because in bitcoin the more outputs a tx has the more it costs in fees, specifying a change address costs more in fees than you'd get by having the change. It does rely on a slightly weird situation, but it does make sense within that context.
Most btc transactions involve a change component.

As u/alfonso1984 says, bitcoin is well placed to assume both functions. But think about it for one second - any successful currency has to be widely held &amp; used.
So there is likely to be an S-curve of adoption whereby bitcoin is mostly a store of wealth (or commodity, asset, or whatever) to begin with, then slowly becomes more an more of a currency as it achieves a sufficient level of saturation.

@_date: 2017-11-22 11:57:05
Did they expect that adoption to happen instantly?
It's pretty obvious that, in order to be a mainstream currency, a coin must *already have* widespread adoption. Until then, the best it can be is a store of value/speculative asset with the capacity for payments.
We're potentially at the bottom of a giant S-curve for Bitcoin. It won't make sense as a mainstream currency until we're at the top of that curve.

Transaction throughput will have to increase. By what rationale do you focus on block size?
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:12:43
If you made a transaction from your BTC wallet, you sent BTC, not BCC.
So the exchange must locate the private key for the BCC address, and use it to unlock your funds on the BTC chain. This is probably a manual process, and you just have to wait for them to get round to it. There's no point watching the funds in an explorer at this point (it's all happening off-chain in the exchange's databases), instead check your BTC wallet on the exchange ever once in a while.

A UTXO is a lump of bitcoin.
If I send 1btc to an address, my wallet finds UTXOs totalling at least 1btc (from bitcoin I've received in the past), and combines them into a single new UTXO, then lets the network know that this new UTXO belongs to whoever owns the address I sent it to.

The miners are hashing a bunch of data (relating to the most recent block, and the potential new block), plus a number (the 'nonce'), trying to produce a hash that begins with *at least* certain number of zeroes (more zeroes as difficulty goes up). Every time they try &amp; fail, they change the nonce &amp; try again. The number of zeroes required is automatically adjusted to keep blocks coming every 10 minutes, on average.
When a miner eventually succeeds in finding such a hash, they submit it to the network for validation.

It's pretty common for businesses to hide from customers the gruesome internal truths behind a shiny 'all is swell' message. Often a metaphor relating to sausage factories is deployed  in allusion to this practice.
As for 'shady' banks and payments processors (pretending for a moment that all the big banks are not shady af) - these were choices forced on them. Didn't HSBC close their bank account with zero notice? Did you expect an exchange to be able to operate without any bank account?
It may well turn out that it was all a con. But the continual exposure of its critics as fudsters, the well-known antipathy from banks to bitcoin businesses, the previous behaviour of those involved (e.g. reaction to the 2016 hack), and the way the market - people with money on the line - react? It is stopping me from rushing to judgement.

Tether is all about traders getting their money onto/off of exchanges at times of their choosing - it was invented to circumvent banks' fuckery (they were holding up payments at random, which is incompatible with trading, where timing is all).
If traders can't use tether, they'll find something else fiat-denominated, and it can't be bitcoin. Because they're traders. They need something to trade bitcoin with, and that... rules out bitcoin.

Very dramatic!
Bitcoin is &amp; will be cheaper to use than the current system, but you *see* what you're paying &amp; when. For some people, that will make it seem more expensive, but that's just because they don't understand how they pay for e.g. a national currency, because it's hidden from them.
One illusion you shouldn't hold on to though - operating a currency/payments network isn't free. Security costs. If an altcoin pretends to have a better solution, what they're really saying is 'don't bother with security'.

Bitcoin is not intended to be cheaper 'up-front' than banks. Some day soon, transaction fees will be much, much higher than they are today (or bitcoin will fail).

'Smart' tends to mean 'great in some limited areas, and as idiotic as the rest of us elsewhere'. $20k in an online wallet is stupid for sure, unless it's a tiny fraction of your total &amp; needs to be stored on a website (e.g. it's your trading stack).
The more transactions you do, the more sense a hardware wallet makes - their whole purpose is to hide the keys from a general purpose computing environment - you'll be exposing yours five times a day, meaning that your bitcoin are as secure as e.g. windows (which is to say, not secure at all).

Nice try ;-)
You have to use your imagination, always balancing the need to keep your seed safe with the requirement not to lose it yourself. Many have settled on engraving/stamping seeds into steel, but if you don't have a good place to store it, that doesn't help much.
Multifactor solutions might help, or splitting the keys via Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm, or simply having a 25th word/password stored elsewhere. One thing I would never do is take a digital picture of my seed, even partially.
If you really can't do it all yourself, people like Casa Hodl are developing new/interesting custodial solutions all the time.
Long story short, being your own bank isn't that easy, but the fact you're thinking this hard about it already puts you in a better position than most.

My own experience is that, unless your clients are already bitcoiners, you will see minimal uptake of bitcoin as a payment method.
I don't think your current customers would be *put off*, but from the sounds of it a simple 'contact us to pay with bitcoin' notice would be sufficient, and a lot less effort.
The truth is that for payments right now - if you're not in a line of business that overbearing governments attempt to disrupt - legacy systems work fine.

But there's a big difference.
London and Hong Kong both grew in locations (and densities) which were suited to trade, but unsuited to the clean generation of practical amounts of electricity. So energy has to be transported to them in the form (primarily) of hydrocarbons, killing the planet. Electricity doesn't travel well you see.
Bitcoin mining, on the other hand, can set up close to remote hydroelectric/geothermal/etc. sources which would otherwise go unused, and do not contribute to climate change. A large majority of hashrate is in this situation, mainly because it's cheap.
The alumina smelting industry followed a similar path, for similar reasons, but Bitcoin's even more suited to extracting value from these resources.
Journalists are not incentivised to understand, let alone convey, such a nuanced picture. Bitcoin doesn't care.

Countries are more complex than your take implies. Sure there are moves towards financial products based on bitcoin in some places, but bitcoin's endgame challenges the modern economic model so fundamentally, that you can be sure there will be draconian attempts to forestall its coming to pass.

Big moves in either direction lead to increased on-chain traffic. The pink numbers are a guess at your transaction's 'priority'- I don't know how sophisticated, but I doubt it's very.
See here - 
That's a graph of the mempool for the last 4 days. Your transaction is in the 3rd darkest green band. If nothing changes price-wise, the size of the mempool will continue to shrink until your transaction is scooped up into a block.

It may turn out that they are playing a long scam- like I said earlier, I don't use any of the businesses/services in question.

Market manipulation is not a big deal, it's manipulation of the underlying rules that really entrenches the 0.001%. The ultra-wealthy cannot manipulate the rules of bitcoin, whereas they are only limited by their imaginations in fiat land.
This alone significantly levels the playing field. Sure, you'll still get hereditary wealth and such, life's not fair etc... but simply stopping the sort of scam that is pulled on populations during currency devaluations, and things like the banks' 2008 ram-raid on government coffers, is a huge improvement.

No definitive answer is possible, but in the last week transactions with a fee like yours have been completely cleared from the mempool a few dozen times.
See here - 
You can boost the fee in a number of ways. Search for "replace by fee" (your transaction needs to have been sent with a certain format), or "transaction accelerator" (pay a miner directly to include your tx in their next block).

It it was obvious, wouldn't the market be reacting accordingly? Perhaps it's not the obvious explanation after all.
For instance, maybe people might think they made the promise of ongoing audits (which I think would be great) before they realised how much of a cat-and-mouse game they'd have to play with regard to banking/payments processors.
Breaking such a promise is obviously not good, but if it's the difference between keeping the (otherwise seemingly successful) business running, or giving in to the banker shenanigans, It's surely the better option.

The market stubbornly refuses to accede to your conception of reality. Rude.
You realise (of course) that with regular audits comes ability for the legacy banking industry to inflict the business-ending disruption that's the very reason for the secrecy in the first place.
That appears to be the game - Deny them access to existing systems, then point and howl that they're not plugged in to existing systems.

A reminder that as ever, bitcoin is a tiny market with a huge profile &amp; plenty of noob traders making bad real-time decisions. A perfect environment for shenanigans by those with deep pockets, in other words.

There's a reason we hodl - for every tale of selling at the top/rebuying at the dip, there are a hundred untold stories where a noob handed all their bitcoin to a rich person.
@_date: 2019-06-28 08:42:56
I think rather than giving the highest point that was reached, most sites implement a system of 'candles', or time periods, and give the highest closing price (i.e. the highest price that a time period closed on).
It's a hangover from the era when exchanges closed each day, and the important/useful figure to know was the closing price.
The result is that you get different maximum prices shown, depending on the size of the time periods used in the particular chart you're using.

LN is here. That means we are in a transition to a situation whereby bitcoin users will be much better off using their on-chain transactions to open &amp; close lightning channels, through which their day-to-day transactions are conducted.
This will mean that the burden imposed by a high fee is spread across many individual bitcoin transactions, ensuring both high security *and* low per-transaction effective fees.
What we cannot risk is a dropping away of the block reward in the absence of a strong fee market to replace it. It looks like we're just about on track to me.

With regard to bcash, the best thing to do is sell it for bitcoin. You might expect this forum to produce such a response, but it's just good sense - even if you're *sure* you'll want some bcash in the future, the fact that it continually drops in price against bitcoin means that you will have much more bcash for your money if you store your wealth in bitcoin &amp; swap into bcash when needed.

Calm down, I'm trying to help you. Between blocks 573181 and 573182 there was a gap of about 15 minutes, so 'up to 11 minutes' must be incorrect.
And as you yourself note if "the average is above 10 minutes, then the factor will be less than 1 and the difficulty level will be decreased", which means your "Due to proof-of-work mechanism technique it makes it harder every time additional block is created" isn't true either.

They wanted bitcoin to remove its censorship resistance - essentially become like paypal but with a native token - in order to help their business model.
Simply wanting that is not so bad, but there were secret meetings with dozens of similarly minded companies/individuals. This group began buying up news sites &amp; running anti-bitcoin propaganda. Opposing businesses were in some cases bought out &amp; turned against the community. It was a full-on attempted coup (if that's the right word for attempting to install leaders in a leaderless system).
Bitcoin's chief vulnerability is on the social layer - we users are open to persuasion/lies/appeals to greed. The second we start tolerating people who actively attempt to undermine bitcoin's core properties, the game is over.
@_date: 2019-04-29 18:32:54
It does exactly that though, doesn't it? The market clearly accepts the company's explanation.

Hope this attitude works out for you, can't see the sense in it myself.
Bitcoin aims to be unstoppable, and this comes with drawbacks. There are plans unfolding to address these drawbacks, but this must happen within the limits imposed by censorship resistance.
If there's a cryptocurrency that looks better than bitcoin, it's doing so by giving up on its *sine qua non*. The people who push them hope (know!) you won't understand this, and they'll be rich &amp; gone before you catch on.

You're exactly right to seek out critics of Bitcoin, and fully explore their arguments. It's a vital part of the process.
The trouble is, the more knowledgeable someone is in the relevant domains (cryptography, computer science, game theory, economics, etc.), the more likely they are to either become pro-Bitcoin, or to restrict their criticism to highly esoteric aspects of the functionality that are hard to understand unless you're at a similar level.

Specific Challenge:
Organized crime and terrorist organizations are often at the forefront of technological innovation in planning, executing and concealing their criminal activities and the revenues stemming from them. Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) are often lagging behind when tackling criminal activities supported by "advanced" technologies.
New knowledge and targeted technologies for fighting both old and new forms of crime and terrorist behaviours supported by advanced technologies;
Test and demonstration of newly developed technology by LEAs involved in proposals;
Innovative curricula, training and (joint) exercises to be used to facilitate the EU-wide take-up of these new technologies, in particular in the fields of:
**Sub-topic: 1.cyber-crime: virtual/crypto currencies des-anonymisation/tracing/impairing where they support underground markets in the darknet.**
Sub-topic: 2.detection and neutralization of rogue/suspicious light drone/UAV flying over restricted areas, and involving as beneficiaries, where appropriate, the operators of infrastructure
Sub-topic: 3.video analysis in the context of legal investigation
Expected Impact:
Short term: Improved investigation capabilities;
Medium/Long term:
Crimes solved more rapidly, to reduce societal distress, investigative costs and the impact on victims and their relatives;
Prevention of more terrorist endeavours;
LEA officers provided with better tools to help them on their (specialized) daily work;
Better identification and understanding of criminal activities.

There was a problem whereby electrum had an exploit, and users were being persuaded to update to compromised versions. Electrum (wallets and servers) was updated to address the issue, but the version tails uses has not yet received this update.
Consequently, electrum on tails cannot currently see the new servers, and so cannot confirm receipt of your btc. But it is secure.
If you need to do something with the btc you have a number of options, but if you don't it's fine to wait for the update to filter through.

The story you link exists only to refute the rumour in your headline.
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:43:56
You may find your own sources. But as a pointer-
Electricity doesn't travel well. Carbon-based sources are so popular for this reason - you can simply ship the energy-dense fuel to power stations near population centres and generate it there.
So you end up with 'stranded' renewable energy sources. A classic example is Iceland's geothermal plants, which for a few decades became the global centre of the alumina smelting industry. The world shipped aluminium ore to them, and they converted it to metal (it's a very energy-intensive process) before sending it back. In this way they 'exported' their resource, and everyone was happy.
Bitcoin miners, like aluminium smelters, do not need the electricity to come to them. So they end up wherever electricity is cheapest. Which is to say, they use hydroelectricity in places with low populations &amp; high generative capacity.
China is such a place. Their centrally planned economy sees them building dams for cities which do not yet exist, and miners step in to take advantage of the very cheap electricity that results.

a) your issue is with the concept of anonymous loans, not bitcoin.
b) things will certainly change - bitcoin discourages that aspect of our current economic paradigm which has given us inbuilt obsolescence, a throwaway culture, and is optimised for maximal resource usage. But 'cannot function' is nonsense.
c) bitcoin is no different to any other asset in this regard.
d) the same way you do with cash. e.g. - If the tax people know you received a transaction, but it doesn't appear in the info you submit to them when you declare your income, they are empowered to put the hurts on you.
e) you've gone from 'loans are impossible' to 'here's a way to make loans'. Can you explain how any large expenditure - a castle, a war, etc. - was achieved prior to the invention of fractional reserve lending?
Basically, your problems are: you're confused about where 'bitcoin the protocol' stops and some of the associated ideology begins; you feel that bitcoin should solve certain additional problems relating to society; you are insisting that a bitcoin-centric economy must have the same structure/problems/linkages as our current system, when clearly things will change, and I'd contend for the better.

Bitcoin blocks are found every 10 minutes *on average*. In fact they follow a poisson distribution, and there is at any given time about a 5% chance that a block will not be found for an hour (iirc).

@_date: 2018-11-20 15:24:14
OP asks a reasonable question, to which there is a reasonable answer.
We were putting the cart before the horse in emphasising bitcoin's payment-facilitating properties. It turns out that assets have to be in *wide* circulation before they can usefully become currencies.
Since late 2013 I've made at least one large purchase a month in bitcoin, and always get a warm glow, telling myself I'm encouraging adoption (I always buy back whatever I spend - plus a little more!). But I've no evidence that's actually true.
Instead it seems like it'd be wiser to give btc directly to friends and family, hoping they're technical enough to keep it safe for a decade, but not technical enough to use it for purchases.
I certainly think that a day will come whereby bitcoin can realistically be viewed as a currency, but I'm happy for now to view it as a government-resistant long-term store of value. One stage at a time.
@_date: 2018-11-27 16:01:43
Probably/hopefully accurate right now, but as bitcoin takes off and the userbase becomes less and less ideological, this will become less and less true.
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:21:36
Yes, such increases are likely to be incorporated when they're both safe &amp; necessary. This is not a new thought.
Two main principles influence people's attitudes to the matter -
1) Blocks must not be made so big that running a node becomes too resource-intensive for most bitcoiners. This will lead to centralisation of validation, which in turn will make bitcoin vulnerable to government interference.
2) A fee market must arise to replace the dwindling block reward. Without such a fee market, the future security of the blockchain is at risk.
Point one is pretty obvious &amp; fairly well understood. Point two is something which causes more worry (to me at least). It's the part of Bitcoin for which there is the least evidence, and which represents the biggest unknown for the future.
@_date: 2019-04-07 16:48:31
a) There's the same enforcement mechanism that you'd use for any other debt. If you are saying you want that built-in to bitcoin for some reason, I'd say that was impossible (not to mention undesirable).
b) in a bitcoin-denominated economy, you're still better off investing your bitcoin in e.g. a business than letting it sit idle. That way you get both the profit/dividend/whatever *plus* the increase in value. But 'richer, less work, more frugal, greener' all sounds good to me, even if the world *wasn't* on fire.
c) There are multiple solutions available now (e.g. Casa's Keymaster product, or simply having multisig spread across a number of lawyers/solicitors/etc. - whoever handles wills in your jurisdiction), and more will certainly arise as bitcoin grows. 
d) I like taxes, and with respect, tax collection doesn't work how you think it does (cash exists already!). I used to get paid to have two takeout meals a week - it was great. If my payments were not included in that business's tax return, punitively high-ball estimates of the company's income were used to calculate their bill instead of what they claimed. Bitcoin does not stop your assets from being sold off, or your ass from going to jail.
e) You're over thinking this. Someone has 100btc sitting idle. Another person wants to borrow 100btc. The first person decides whether to lend, how much they're looking to be compensated for the risk they take, and a deal is struck (or not). Same as with the business investment in 'b', you make more than simply hodling because you also earn interest.
All of this ignores the (near-certain imho) possibility that bitcoin will be used, as other valuable assets are/have been, as underpinning for fractional reserve systems of one type or other. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 23:31:02
Depends on the use case. Will you be spending this money regularly? Is it for long-term storage? For the former, you can't do better than a hardware wallet, though low amounts are probably fine on a regularly updated phone (I like Samourai wallet for android).
If you're talking about more than loose change, then you need a method that never exposes your private key to a general purpose computing environment. Again, hardware wallets (Trezor or Ledger) are the best, but-
I can recommend the version of electrum that is bundled with TailsOS. It's free, simple enough, and your wallet exists only as a seed phrase that you write down. The OS is a locked down, security focused version of linux that never interacts with your HDD.

There's no way to tell if two addresses from the same seed are related. That said, if you stick with the same seed/wallet then you may well end up linking addresses together when change from one transaction is used as an input on the next.
If you propose to buy on an exchange, send that btc to a wallet, spend all the btc from the wallet, then never use the same wallet again (i.e. the next time you buy you send to a new wallet), then you remove the risk of the situation above.
The downside would be that you will be leaving small amounts of change behind (which might become valuable in the future), so to minimise this you try to buy almost exactly what you need from an exchange, then the btc price drops and you no longer have enough for your purchase.
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:56:54


If I were an evil bankster facing hyperbitcoinization, my plan would be:
1) Tell governments to announce that a bitcoin standard (like the old gold standard) is being introduced.
2) Have them construct it such that there's an amnesty, during which bitcoiners can submit their btc to the govt. in exchange for the 'correct' amount of the new btc-backed currency.
3) Make it clear that once the amnesty's over, private individuals transacting in bitcoin will be outlaws.
4) End the amnesty, and (assuming a good proportion of bitcoiners acceded to the govt demands) return to the current system.

It's unfortunately necessary to loudly call a fraud (or anything that might be one) a fraud.
Once you understand *why* a blockchain works, it's very hard to tolerate people who don't 'get it' advocating for their inappropriate use.

In the first argument, the author ignores the monopoly-breaking pressure brought about by the wide dispersal of very cheap electricity. Think of energy cost as a topographic overlay on the globe - Mining will tend to seek out and occupy the lowest points, much as water does. His argument is no different to insisting that cheap energy sources are a natural monopoly, which they empirically aren't.
His second point ignores bitcoin's network effect, and appears unaware of the very high barriers any 'superior competitor' must overcome - i.e. whatever new, bitcoin-beating tech it brings to the table must somehow be impossible to implement within bitcoin (this includes replicating the UTXO set within a totally new paradigm if necessary).

Any blockchain's primary purpose *must* be the recording of the permissionless &amp; censor-resistant ownership/transactions/etc. of a value-bearing, native token. They have no value otherwise.
On top of this primary purpose may piggy-back light-weight secondary uses such as timestamping.
Owing to the nature of money/value, this means that outside of the dominant blockchain (i.e. bitcoin) there is almost no valid case to be made for the use of a blockchain. I say "almost" because until Bitcoin's fungibility is fixed, something like Monero is clearly justifiable.
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:55:51
It's just saying that bitcoin's utxo model has fewer moving parts, imposes fewer requirements on any process trying to interact with it, and so is less restrictive when it comes to the different ways scaling could occur.
There are more rules to adhere to with an account model, which removes certain options.

So if I get this right, regardless of upgrading your node or not, your node will follow the longest chain?


In a hard fork the two resulting chains/protocols are incompatible, so nodes of each have no problem rejecting the other chain's blocks.
The main problems concern the process - how to get everyone to upgrade simultaneously. It's important to Bitcoin's design that updates can't be forced on users, but this has the side effect of making hard forks dangerous - unwary/uninformed users get 'forked off' the network without them realising. They are then easy meat to bad people, who will rip them off in various ways.

Nodes allow us to verify that the blockchain is working as intended. They don't earn bitcoin.
They are different from miners, who mine blocks in exchange for a bitcoin reward. Miners have already bought their machines, and need to pay that outlay off by continuing to mine.
Additionally, many miners will be 'fans' of bitcoin. That territory goes with a belief that the price will rise in the future, so getting the coins now for a low price is justifiable.

If we're talking large sums (or regular spending), you should get a hardware wallet.

The problem is that your private keys need to be secure. This isn't possible if you give them to someone else, or if they're stored in a general purpose computing environment.
Paper wallets are fine if you do them properly, and are aiming for long-term storage. Otherwise (and especially if we're talking about 3-4 btc), you should buy a hardware wallet.
Hardware wallets allow you to be 'online', but isolate your private keys. They make everyday spending much more secure &amp; convenient than any other option.
Trezor &amp; Ledger are the two brands to consider.

It's easier to mine than buy for some people. Others attach a premium to freshly minted coins. Still others will be mining outside of pools, hoping to cheat the odds and score a block reward all to themselves. There are lots of plausible reasons.
But in the ideological case I gave, these fans of bitcoin probably enjoy running a mining rig - the sense of contributing to the security of the network of which they are so fond.

It would be surprising, given bitcoin's potential, if certain rich &amp; greedy interests were not trying to install themselves as rulers in some sense.
Bitcoin will face more of this in the coming years, and these 'attacks' will only become more sophisticated. In truth, we're lucky we got to train ourselves on such an obviously villainous attempt as the bCash Putsch. But Bitcoin's userbase is only becoming less and less ideological over time, and that is a serious worry.
Basically, if we don't care enough about this shit, at some point one of these attacks is going to succeed. In that context, it becomes easy to defend some of the zealotry that fans of other coins see as maximalism, or even supremacy.

You'll probably lose money.
The idea is you give them a large amount of bitcoin to buy mining equipment, and they slowly trickle back small amounts until you're whole plus some. But mining works on a thin margin (something which will only persist as the industry matures). This scheme just introduces an extra 'mouth to feed', a wholly bad idea.

Expecting bitcoin to be a fully-formed store of value instantly is, as would be for currency status, naive. Confidence in such properties takes time to build, and cannot appear worldwide overnight.


If only this were true. The value of your dollars steadily erodes as the supply inflates. It may (assuming the past is a reasonable guide to the future) take ~20 years, rather than 1, for your 50 bucks to halve in value, but that's not true for all currencies, and will not be true of USD forever.

Banks don't want blockchain. They want to appear cutting-edge to their shareholders, and to be able to say to customers who ask about cryptocurrency "we've got our own version, backed by us, in the works". It's just a buzzword to them.
Blockchains must as their main purpose record ownership &amp; transfer of **native value-bearing tokens**. Secondary uses (e.g. timestaps) can only occur if the primary purpose is as above. This truth will kill much of the banking industry's revenue models.

Very much so. A hardware wallet is a device designed to keep your private keys away from a (fundamentally insecure) general purpose computer: A software wallet on a PC prepares a transaction, then you plug in the hardware wallet which 'signs' the transaction using the private key, so that it can be sent out into the network for validation &amp; incorporation in a block.
A wallet seed is a phrase (i.e. a bunch of random words) from which wallet software can derive multiple cryptographic keypairs. Each of these keypairs splits into a Bitcoin address (after a little hashing) and a private key (used to sign transactions involving UTXOs assigned to the associated address).
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:38:01
The only conclusion that makes sense is that whoever had the private key for that address thought the bitcoin were legitimately theirs. Most people are going to assume you're lying, but giving you the benefit of the doubt, you're going to need some kind of Bitcoin Sherlock Holmes to even figure out a plausible explanation.

It's worth playing with this software to get proficient, prior to putting your BTC on the line...
* Download TailsOS- 
* With a blank DVD in your drive, right-click the .iso file and select 'burn a bootable image' or similar.
* Access your computer's BIOS (e.g. F2 on startup), and place your DVD drive ahead of your C drive in the boot priority list (this is all straight-forward on 99% of computers).
* Reboot your computer, it should boot into Tails rather than the usual OS.
* Connect to the internet
* Open Electrum (Applications&gt;Internet IIRC) and follow instructions to generate a new wallet. (sometimes Electrum struggles to connect to the network, but this is easily fixed, let me know if you struggle)
You'll then have 12 words and a wallet full of addresses just begging to be filled with bitcoin. You can send BTC to these addresses from an exchange, and they'll only "exist" as the 12 words you wrote down. Pretty secure.
Undo the BIOS changes (or simply remove the bootable disc) and you'll boot into your everyday OS as normal.
Feel free to ask me if you're struggling. I'm not an expert, but I've encountered most of the common problems before.

Agreed. Bubbles can only definitively be called in retrospect.

You'll find that what seems easy in principle is less so in practice. You're also not accounting for the fact that as you begin to arbitrage between two exchanges, the gap will narrow (i.e. it won't stay at x1.07 throughout your 40 trades, since you'll be making the coins scarcer on the undervalued exchange, and less scarce on the overvalued one).

Apologies for the length of this, which I've posted before. You can't really understand 2x without this background.
Bitcoin devs came up with a cool bit of tech to improve Bitcoin (Segwit - it increases capacity &amp; makes a bunch of new features easy to implement). Unbeknown to those devs, this improvement inadvertently neutralised a neat trick the largest miner had come up with to make his mining more efficient (which equals more profit). This same miner had for some time harboured ambitions to rule Bitcoin. He was putting tens of millions into infrastructure, unlike users/devs/etc, and couldn't understand why he wasn't consequently in charge of the whole system.
He hatched a plan intended to stall the implementation of Segwit, a plan which over time grew to include the goal of displacing the open/decentralised dev structure, and installing himself as king. He met with some Bitcoin devs in Hong Kong, agreeing to implement segwit if the devs would also code-up a change from 1MB to 2MB blocks. Under this proposal, Segwit would be a soft fork, and the 2MB bump would happen as a hard fork if it gained the support of the users. The devs began coding for segwit, but support for the 2MB hard fork was absent (the downsides far outweigh any benefit - users saw that 2MB blocks make it easier for a ruling class to install itself). The miner, rich on his secretly buffed profits, embarked on a spending spree. He bought healthy stakes in many of the most prominent players in the Bitcoin ecosystem (who changed overnight from user-supporting to miner-supporting positions). He also attracted certain individuals who own lots of bitcoin, and who also long for Bitcoin to acquire a ruling class.
Angered by the community's refusal to accede to his 2MB fork, and eager to continue to enjoy his secret buff, the miner came out against Segwit (which had been designed to be activated by the miners). Together the wannabe-bosses began building a largely faked support (there exists much evidence of huge paid-for tweeting programmes and the like - there's actual billions at stake remember). Some useful idiots, unable to see how Bitcoin works and easily swayed by tough-talking strongmen, were swept along. Around 20% of the apparent user base is now aligned with the miner.
With segwit still not implemented, one user devised a way to organise the power of all users to force the miners to implement segwit - this method was named "UASF" (or BIP148). It was well constructed, and scared the miner into meeting with his aspiring courtiers in New York, where they came up with "Segwit2X", a counter-plan to activate Segwit 'on their terms', which is tied to a 2MB hard fork as per their previous scheme. The miner's new plan was poorly conceived, widely judged to be simultaneously an attempt to further forestall segwit, install a ruling class, and prove the miners' power in the face of the upstart (from their perspective) UASF.
The UASF succeeded. To save face and inflict petulant damage on Bitcoin, the miner then paid for the creation of a new coin (Bcash) forked from Bitcoin, marketed as 'the real Bitcoin', and quickly rejected by users (today it has the same number of tx in a day that Bitcoin has in 10 minutes). But at least we now have segwit. To nobody's great surprise, the miner and his acolytes are now pushing ahead with the 2MB part of their Segwit2X plan, and that's where we are today. They could easily fork from their own Bcash chain in a far less dramatic way, but their current plan is to fork from Bitcoin in a deliberately destructive way, which this analogy attempts to illustrate:
Imagine some sorcerer could have every American wake up one day to find that each dollar bill they'd owned at bed time had been joined in their wallets by a wizardly duplicate. Seems great, but you discover that everything you do with the wizardbucks is magically enacted on your real dollars too (e.g. you sell/spend/bin them and your real $$$ disappears also). Additionally they're so hard to distinguish from the real $$$ that people accidentally use/accept one instead of the other.
All we have to do is ignore the wizardbucks, but people are scared easily, this shit's complicated, and the wizard has a fake grassroots campaign in place already.

If it happens, it will be just like the Bcash fork. I.e. a new alt will be born featuring blocks with a greatly expanded maximum size, but no transactions to fill them.
They'll loudly proclaim it to be the one true Bitcoin, but will immediately begin work on the next attack fork.

I agree, it does seem reasonable. It's really only when you get beneath the surface &amp; analyse the consequences that you realise how harmful such an increase has the potential to be.
I personally would love *huge* blocks. It's just that I've come to understand that there are show-stopping drawbacks. Probably everyone in the 'small blocks' camp feels the same.

Need to know - is it substantial amounts? Are you spending often, or mostly hodling?
For small amounts (e.g. &lt;0.1 BTC), I think a PC/phone wallet is fine. Electrum, Samourai, etc.
For large amounts (hodling &amp; spending rarely) I'd go with a hardware wallet, a paper wallet, GreenAddress, or Electrum-on-TailOS.
For large amounts (hodling &amp; spending often) you should get a hardware wallet.

That's not right. All the previous blocks don't double, only the ones *after* the fork. Even then, it's the *maximum possible* blocksize which doubles, not the actual blocksize (which is bigger or smaller depending on the number and size of transactions in each block).
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:29:12


A natively digital money has properties that the fiat system cannot. Ever thought it weird that you have to hand merchants the keys to your entire account when you buy things, then hope they only take from it what they should? Of course, big databases of account-accessing info arise, then get stolen, and then we all pay for that.
But this is only a side-effect. Bitcoin exists because governments have shown - over and over - that they are not to be trusted with the levers of monetary policy.
In an ideal world, centralised is *always* better. On-the-hoof decisions, fine-tuning, reaction &amp; anticipation can extract efficiencies and improvements which a 'dumb' monetary policy like Bitcoin's cannot. But we do not live in an ideal world, far from it.
Bitcoin exists to protect us from the reality that, if you give other humans control of that which you hold dear, they'll screw you over. Maybe intentionally, maybe not, but it's always only a matter of time.
@_date: 2017-09-18 09:37:50
A conservative choice would be Electrum. It's been going for years, the devs are well-known and active contributors to the Bitcoin world, etc. It's a bit feature-lacking (you usually have to install another app to get the QR code scanner working), but what it does, it does well.
I check out all the well-known Android wallets on a rolling basis. My current favourite is Samourai. There are some problems (still in early development, not properly open source, not clear about where their money comes from, etc.), but it has some sweet features.

I'd bail into another coin entirely (and I'm Bitcoin-to-the-core, if we're reducing it to teams).

You could easily split up the seed phrase if that's an issue. Finding one of multiple wallet.dat files is easier than finding your seed phrase if it's similarly well hidden.
In reality, you're more likely to lose the coins to a clever obfuscation strategy than an attacker. Figure out any foolproof method that lets you sleep at night &amp; you'll be fine.

Yes, the design is such that said manipulations cost more than they're worth.
The bit Satoshi couldn't solve is in the weak minds and hands of those who are scared by threats from Ver/Wu/etc., because it's only if you believe in them that they can hurt you/Bitcoin.

Miners spend a very large amount of money on their machines. They use these machines to do work, as instructed by users.

The amount of electricity used relates (in theory) to the block rewards the miners receive for mining the blocks. So (again, in theory) the 'halfenings' that happen every 4 years should act as a brake on runaway hashrate.
Basically, miners should use a little less in electricity than they make in bitcoin. they also need to cover equipment/buildings/wages/etc., but the nature of the business should see profits tend towards a bare minimum.

It will confirm eventually without you having to do anything, but if there's a reason you need it all to happen quickly you may find there are options.

I'm not sure anyone truly understands Bitcoin. But- the important thing is not the code, it's the system it describes. Understand each piece, then put them together in your head. It's a bit like putting together a bunch of cogs that comprise some unknown mechanism - look for bits that you don't understand and play with them until you see how they relate to the wider system.
It's always really obvious (and common) when someone's talking about Bitcoin, whether positively or negatively, and they haven't gotten their head around (e.g.) Nakamoto Consensus.

I tried google before posting, ~4 times as many results for 'shapeshift scam' as for 'changelly scam'. In both cases it looks more like people venting because of poor customer support.
I've seen terrible rates (specifically for fiat to crypto) on Changelly, but in the one side-by-side comparison I did (ltc-to-btc), Changelly was marginally cheaper than Shapeshift.

For meaningful values of forever, yes.


Bitcoins are infinitely divisible (the number of decimal places, unlike the total number of bitcoin, is trivially extended). Even if humanity only had the private key to unlock a single satoshi, we could share that fraction of a bitcoin around as easily as if we still had 21 million btc.

A common misapprehension. Although you get more confirmations per unit time, each confirmation is worth proportionately less, so you need more of them.
Obvious if you think about it- acceptable levels of certainty are derived from how much hashpower you'd need to undo/redo the blocks you wish to reorganise (or be 'unreorganisable'). 10 mins of hashpower is 10 mins of hashpower, regardless of whether you generated 1 block or (e.g.) 50 in those 10 mins.
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:10:01
This is pretty out of date. Not only is the block reward 50 BTC, but there's no mention of nodes at all (the functions of miners/nodes/wallets were all carried out by one bit of software back then).
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:46:37

These were the very early days, the difficulty was not changing much, and few new miners were getting involved.


Not sure what you mean here. Difficulty can go down as well as up - it's reactive to the hashrate. A block every 10 minutes is the goal.

The difficulty doesn't keep going up by design - it rises and falls according to how much computing power is attempting to mine blocks. The idea being to keep it roughly around one block being solved every 10 minutes.
So if miners left, difficulty would adjust downwards.
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:39:50
Most important step - Figure out who you'll be leaving your bitcoin to, and educate them on how to use it.
You can then do things like (e.g.) secure their inheritance in a 2 of 2 multisig wallet, where they get 1 key before your death, and whomever executes your will gives them the other.
(there are probably better ways to do this, but you get the general idea)

1) Everyone involved with NYA/2X knows, deep down, that the users call the shots. The users overwhelmingly support core's roadmap. Additionally, they know it's being so poorly executed that most businesses will be obliged to avoid it (lack of proper replay protection is a show-stopper).

For sure. I'm not really up to date with what coinbase are up to, but from what I've picked up here, their current plan is to sell all their customers' bitcoin in November, and replace them with 2x coins. Can't believe they'll actually do that though (the lawsuits!).

I don't think there is a good argument against cryptocurrency, but there are plausible arguments that new advances in cryptography could enable a coin with better properties (faster confirmation, smaller blockchain, more privacy, etc.). The advances would have to be such that Bitcoin couldn't co-opt them, and be so much better than the current situation that the strong network effects of Bitcoin are overcome.

But yeah, I think you're right in a way. Our current system has lead to the mindless consumption of ever-increasing volumes of *things*, built-in obsolescence and e.g. clothes that fall apart in a year. We're literally burning our way through our resources at breakneck speed, and our system relies on that not only being maintained, but needs annual growth too.
I think Bitcoin's deflationary nature will mean a change in this arguably unsustainable situation, but people will still need to buy things for sure.
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:49:28

Each of these fork attacks causes less disruption than the one before it, as the system (including users, businesses, etc.) learns how little Bitcoin gives a fuck.

It's more that mining is difficult, so only certain people (i.e. capable people) are successful at it. Your efforts to date make it clear you are not going to succeed at this.
While I'm here- in response to another commenter you state that you'd have bought at $900, but aren't so eager at ~$5,000. You're only saying that because you know it went up from $900. Had you been around at $900 (any of the $900s), you'd have viewed it as you view $5,000 now.

Nodes, not miners, enforce the protocol. Miners signalling is more akin to showing readiness to deal with protocol upgrades. Miners are essentially users' employees, and users will fire them if they refuse to do their job.


Some opinions are more different than others. Anyone supportive of attempts to weaken Bitcoin is by definition an enemy of Bitcoin.


That's how it ended up, after users rejected it. But it's not what they were trying to achieve.


It certainly exists. For example, look back at their debates around implementing replay protection (assuming you understand how a lack of same would have amounted to a malicious attack on Bitcoin users).

These constant half-baked economic arguments are pitiful. Saying Bitcoin can't work because of volatility is breathtakingly simple-headed. He might as well mock the idea that an egg in a nest might one day fly.
Though growing fast, Bitcoin is still tiny in financial terms. Even minnows of the legacy finance world can cause huge spikes in the price. The problem is Bitcoin is such a good idea - so obviously the future - that it's getting attention more suited to a much bigger market.
This is what causes the volatility, a mismatch between size and profile. As Bitcoin's total value ('M2' or similar) grows so the volatility shrinks. It's measurable and happening.

Bitcoin was created in response to problems endemic in capitalist economies. The problems it solves are, if anything, *more* prevalent in the most deregulated free market economies.
In many ways, the problems left and right-leaning countries face are mirrors of each other. Socialist states tend to suffer from a ruling elite that treats itself as 'more equal than others'. Capitalist states go the other way, i.e. 'socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor'.

If it's safe to do so in 2018, they may well propose such a change. It's not safe now. Do you get that? Literally not safe. It could kill this cool experiment we're undertaking.

Create a wallet using the edition of electrum bundled with TailsOS. All you need to do is save your 12 word seed, and you've got a super-secure bitcoin wallet.
If you export the master public key for the wallet (after you create it in tails), you can even import that into an android version of electrum, and use it to both monitor your funds &amp; create new receiving addresses, all the while knowing your coins are as safe as possible.
This method is free, ultra-high security (until you type your seed into an android/windows wallet), and you get the added buzz of memorising the seed, and carrying your stash around in your head. 
Hardware wallets are great, and if spending often is a feature of your bitcoin use, kinda the only sensible option. But for hodling this works well.

Think of it like this - Say there are two competing 'swarms' of nodes, one side happy to relay 2x blocks, the other rejecting 2x blocks. It doesn't really matter, past a certain (low) point, how many nodes are in each swarm. What matters is whether you, a user, accept coins from a transaction included in a 2x block. The nodes only passed the info to you, it's up to you what you do with it.

You send euro/dollars/etc. to an exchange, and buy bitcoin with it, which the exchange keeps in a wallet for you. You then send the bitcoin to your own wallet (one for which you and only you have the private keys), because exchanges have a habit of collapsing, taking stored funds with them.

If someone with 51% of the hashpower tries to kill off a minority chain, we could simply change the PoW algorithm. It's a nuclear option (because of what it does to the investments of 'good' miners), but it's an option.
I think an attack on any minority chain is very unlikely, because if they're in the business of establishing a new altcoin, the last thing they'd want their customer base to experience is them pulling dick-moves on Bitcoin holders. It screams "bad actor", and that's the opposite of the image they'd need to cultivate.
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:36:59
It is predicated on a very unlikely scenario (that there are lots of noobs who'd make such a mistake simultaneously), and a misunderstanding (lack of replay protection means it's possible in effect to accidentally send btc when sending 2x coins, not that it's possible to accidentally *sell* them).
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:10:20
When your coins are controlled only by you, you get to decide everything that happens. You can do with each fork coin as you wish.
When your coins are controlled by e.g. coinbase, you are beholden to the whims of that company. According to their most recent pronouncement (their stance keeps changing), Coinbase are threatening to adopt the new 2x coin as 'the real Bitcoin', which could mean you're left having to take them to court to release your Bitcoin (the original, that they, in this potential future, claim is no longer real).
It makes no sense to risk such a scenario when you currently are immune to it.

The keys are usually derived from a seed phrase, which you'd be advised to keep secure/separately from your hardware wallet, which makes wallet restoration possible.

If history is a guide, they'll create a new alt which they'll have to support with their own cash. It will fail to gain traction, and in time their focus will shift to the next attack on Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is young, and these fork-to-an-altcoin attacks can be compared to vaccinations. They each teach the system a little more about how it can defend itself, to the point that eventually we won't even notice them.
Each time the price will take a little less of a hit, as each attack's degree of market-spooking uncertainty drops compared to the previous one.

It's all about being able to sleep at night... Tails is a hardened Linux distro, designed to be used in adversarial situations. No malware on your HDD can interact with a TailsOS session. You can only connect to the internet via TOR, and no trace of anything you did is left on the PC afterwards.
Trezors/Legders/etc. exist solely to keep your private keys away from a general purpose machine. TailsOS does a similar job for free, and is useful in other ways too.
If you ever type a seed phrase on a Windows box, it is impossible to be sure that no current or future software can retrieve it from some dark corner of the file system. Given Bitcoin's meteoric rise, such malware is no longer conceptual. Any seed phrase typed into Windows should be regarded as 'burned', and all bitcoin associated with it should be moved asap.
I'm not saying Tails is totally impenetrable, but it shuts 99% of the holes that are open. Anyone who can exploit the remaining 1% is skilled enough that you were screwed the minute they targeted you.

Wallets aren't directly identifiable on the blockchain, though analysis can certainly identify links between specific addresses.

No downvotes from me. You correctly identify that 'keeping the network reliable' is one of core's goals. They think 2x changes the rules in a way that threatens reliability, so are unable to support it.
Core has no interest in keeping to 1MB. If it was safe/necessary to go higher, they would want to. It's not (yet), so they dont (yet).

Well within their rights. But it makes them enemies of Bitcoin users.


Some people tried to instil themselves as 'bosses' of Bitcoin at the start of August (Bitcoin has no bosses, but the prize if they'd succeeded was/is so great that it's worth the reputational damage). They failed, and it consequently resulted in the birth of an altcoin known as Bcash.

Any miner who tries to award themselves more than the correct block reward will find that the rest of the network reject their faulty block.
The rest of the network are incentivised to do this in a number of ways, the chief one being it would result in the price of bitcoin rapidly approaching zero.

You can set whatever fee you like (if you can't, get a new wallet). Fees less than 10% of yours currently get typical txs confirmed straight away.
But fees are based on the tx size, which in turn relates to the number of inputs. Maybe the funds that comprise your $9 are divided into little sums currently.

As I explained, a Jihan-style attack is pretty likely to attract sufficient defectors from the 49% to render such an attack very hard (remember, miners in the 49% are getting punked over and over by the attackers reorgs on their chain). A non-Jihan-style 'smoking crater' attack, that just wants to kill Bitcoin, is very unlikely (almost impossible). But has no need for a viable attackers chain.
As I (and Andreas in your vid, and the website you linked, lolol) have explained to you though, a PoW change would be performed on the minority chain. The nuclear option of my first post.

Electrum is a good choice, but I'd try to avoid storing bitcoin long-term whose private keys have been exposed to a normal OS environment.
I don't know about your technical proficiency, but it's pretty easy (&amp; free!) to: download TailsOS, boot from a live CD, generate a wallet seed (write this down) in the bundled version of Electrum, send your bitcoin to an address in that wallet, then store the seed phrase someplace safe.
Then you have a 'cold storage' wallet that exists only as 12 words, and your private keys are far less likely to be compromised. You can even use this setup to create a 'watch-only' wallet - e.g. an android/windows wallet that you can use to monitor your stash, and accept new payments, but which cannot spend (so is very safe).

There's no need to take any risk. Very secure options are available for free. Electrum itself allows you to set up 2fa, for a small per-transaction fee.
Electrum encrypts your seed and private keys, and so the risk comes when you enter info that can decrypt either/both. I honestly don't know how to do this safely in windows, and personally couldn't sleep at night if I had more than 0.05BTC in a wallet that had been decrypted *once* in such an environment.

Ultimately this is all about the users, a consistent ~85% of whom are unswayed by the corporate coin's lobbying. They're who decides what Bitcoin is. They're who hashpower follows. They're who get to determine validity. It's not ambiguous at all.

@_date: 2017-10-31 17:00:20
Apologies for the length of this, which I've posted before. You can't really understand 2x without this background.
Bitcoin devs came up with a cool bit of tech to improve Bitcoin (Segwit - it increases capacity &amp; makes a bunch of new features easy to implement). Unbeknown to those devs, this improvement inadvertently neutralised a neat trick the largest miner had come up with to make his mining more efficient (which equals more profit). This same miner had for some time harboured ambitions to rule Bitcoin. He was putting tens of millions into infrastructure, unlike users/devs/etc, and couldn't understand why he wasn't consequently in charge of the whole system.
He hatched a plan intended to stall the implementation of Segwit, a plan which over time grew to include the goal of displacing the open/decentralised dev structure, and installing himself as king. He met with some Bitcoin devs in Hong Kong, agreeing to implement segwit if the devs would also code-up a change from 1MB to 2MB blocks. Under this proposal, Segwit would be a soft fork, and the 2MB bump would happen as a hard fork if it gained the support of the users. The devs began coding for segwit, but support for the 2MB hard fork was absent (the downsides far outweigh any benefit - users saw that 2MB blocks make it easier for a ruling class to install itself). The miner, rich on his secretly buffed profits, embarked on a spending spree. He bought healthy stakes in many of the most prominent players in the Bitcoin ecosystem (who changed overnight from user-supporting to miner-supporting positions). He also attracted certain individuals who own lots of bitcoin, and who also long for Bitcoin to acquire a ruling class.
Angered by the community's refusal to accede to his 2MB fork, and eager to continue to enjoy his secret buff, the miner came out against Segwit (which had been designed to be activated by the miners). Together the wannabe-bosses began building a largely faked support (there exists much evidence of huge paid-for tweeting programmes and the like - there's actual billions at stake remember). Some useful idiots, unable to see how Bitcoin works and easily swayed by tough-talking strongmen, were swept along. Around 20% of the apparent user base is now aligned with the miner.
With segwit still not implemented, one user devised a way to organise the power of all users to force the miners to implement segwit - this method was named "UASF" (or BIP148). It was well constructed, and scared the miner into meeting with his aspiring courtiers in New York, where they came up with "Segwit2X", a counter-plan to activate Segwit 'on their terms', which is tied to a 2MB hard fork as per their previous scheme. The miner's new plan was poorly conceived, widely judged to be simultaneously an attempt to further forestall segwit, install a ruling class, and prove the miners' power in the face of the upstart (from their perspective) UASF.
The UASF succeeded. To save face and inflict petulant damage on Bitcoin, the miner then paid for the creation of a new coin (Bcash) forked from Bitcoin, marketed as 'the real Bitcoin', and quickly rejected by users (today it has the same number of tx in a day that Bitcoin has in 10 minutes). But at least we now have segwit. To nobody's great surprise, the miner and his acolytes are now pushing ahead with the 2MB part of their Segwit2X plan, and that's where we are today. They could easily fork from their own Bcash chain in a far less dramatic way, but their current plan is to fork from Bitcoin in a deliberately destructive way, which this analogy attempts to illustrate:
Imagine some sorcerer could have every American wake up one day to find that each dollar bill they'd owned at bed time had been joined in their wallets by a wizardly duplicate. Seems great, but you discover that everything you do with the wizardbucks is magically enacted on your real dollars too (e.g. you sell/spend/bin them and your real $$$ disappears also). Additionally they're so hard to distinguish from the real $$$ that people accidentally use/accept one instead of the other.
All we have to do is ignore the wizardbucks, but people are scared easily, this shit's complicated, and the wizard has a fake grassroots campaign in place already.

You are probably best off keeping your coins with coinbase. 
I would not normally say that, but to believe in 2x is, implicitly, to prefer other people being in charge of your own stuff.
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:10:48
Yes, you do. Holding your own keys is the only way to be certain you do get the 2x coins. 
Coinbase users, for instance, never received their Bcash from that fork. That's a lot of money to lose, just for using coinbase (they claim, presumably in response to legal threats, to be working to give their customers some BCH in 2018. They will not be able to get 2017 prices for them)

The more transactions employ segwit, the more room there is for everyone else, which means the lower fees would be.
Your fee is a bid for scarce block space. The less scarce block space is, the lower the bar gets for a bid to be a winner.

Not needed to buy, but needed to sell if your coins are held on keys stored in your trezor.
If you're genuinely aiming to buy a lot of BTC, an ATM is a terrible way to do so, owing to the charges/rates involved. Register on an exchange (gemini in US, bl3p.eu in Europe).
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:36:07
Correct. Assuming 2x goes ahead, the safest course of action is to wait for the dust to settle, then when everything's stable/working (&amp; before you do anything else), split your coins.
There will be multiple options for doing so, which will be publicised widely.

I'm sure it won't ease their pain, but they're performing a vital service to the Bitcoin community.
People have to learn that the world wants to take their bitcoin from them. That's all these scammy bitcoin forks amount to- tricks pulled by crooks to rob bitcoin owners. Each one will teach people a little more, until we're entirely immune.
@_date: 2017-09-30 14:00:15
I did too. Ver &amp; Wu have burned through tens of millions supporting it, but the stakes are so high that I guess that's a worthwhile gamble. And now the volumes are so low that it costs comparatively negligible amounts to keep the price roughly stable.
But check out recent videos of Ver, there's certainly a frustration bubbling away below the surface. He seems to be realising that his only big decision is how much he's willing to lose before giving in.
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:21:38
This is exactly as it should be. It took me *months* to go from 'okay, I like the idea' to 'I understand this enough to commit substantial sums'. In those months the price sky-rocketted, but I don't regret it at all, because that same behaviour has saved me on many occasions.
I get a little freaked out by all the posts on here from noobs asking how some (relatively) simple aspect of Bitcoin works, *after* they've already sunk thousands of their hard-earned. Those chumps got lucky with Bitcoin, but will likely be parted from their earnings the next time round.

Just send a transaction. Sweeping into HD wallets should be a temporary thing (i.e. followed swiftly by a transaction), as the private keys in question cannot be restored from the wallet's seed.

The thing I don't get is:
Say you'd prefer a corporate-controlled coin, where you need to trust some people, over a decentralised coin. Fine, that's your call. It's weird, but whatever. But surely to fuck you'd still want it to be run by reputable people of good character?
By pulling a dick-move like no replay protection, they are only establishing their total unsuitability for the position they are awarding themselves. They're saying, in very loud voices, "You can't trust us to do the right thing!".
Why would anyone - even the corpcoin-loving trustaholic - use that coin?

It's not a stupid question, but the different things you mention each push the rate &amp; fees one way or the other...
So credit cards &amp; cash get worse rates than e.g. bank transfers. The more verification (i.e. waiting time) you can tolerate, the better the rate. Etc.

You've confused some terms, and it's leading you astray. Read up on the difference between segwit (a protocol change, already implemented), and segwit2x (an agreement signed by some businesses, yet to be implemented). Then figure out how the 8mb fork relates to Bitcoin.
Then come back and ask about toxic, I'll be happy to help once you understand the basics.

There's no official, only what we agree to agree on. Satoshi is the accepted term for sure.
@_date: 2017-10-31 11:15:15
Nobody knows what happens when blockchains try to work at such scale, but there are good reasons to believe non-trivial barriers exist.
I also think that, for all the deserved praise heaped on decentralised/math-governed systems, they will still be susceptible to being outmanoeuvred in the short term by centralised systems governed by capable leaders. So I don't think a single currency like Bitcoin could ever dominate to the extent that nothing else is used.

1) Bitcoin devs came up with a cool bit of tech to improve Bitcoin (segwit - it basically makes a bunch of new features easy to implement). Unbeknown to those devs, this improvement inadvertently neutralises a neat trick the largest miner had come up with to make themselves more efficient (which equals much profit).
  
2) This miner had for some time harboured ambitions to rule Bitcoin. He was putting tens of millions into infrastructure, and couldn't understand why he wasn't therefore in charge of the system. He hatched a plan intended to stall the implementation of Segwit, which over time grew to include the goal of displacing the current open/decentralised dev structure, in order to install himself as king. He meets with some Bitcoin devs, proposing to implement segwit if the devs would also code-up a change from 1MB to 2MB blocks. Segwit would be a soft fork, and the 2MB bump would happen as a hard fork if it gained the support of the users. The devs begin coding for segwit, but support for the 2MB hard fork is absent (the downsides far outweigh any benefit - users can see that 2MB blocks make it easier for a ruling class to install itself).
3) The miner, rich on his secretly buffed profits, embarks on a spending spree. He buys healthy stakes in many of the most prominent players in the Bitcoin ecosystem (all of whom changed overnight from user-supporting to miner-supporting). He also attracts certain individuals who own lots of bitcoin, and who also long for Bitcoin to acquire a ruling class. Angered by the community's refusal to accede to his 2MB fork, and eager to continue to enjoy his secret buff, the miner comes out against segwit (which was coded to be activated by 'good' miners, and so can be blocked by even a small proportion of 'bad' ones).
4) Together the wannabe-bosses begin building a largely faked support (there exists much evidence of huge paid-for tweeting programmes and the like - there's actual billions at stake remember). Some useful idiots, unable to see how Bitcoin works and easily swayed by tough-talking strongmen, are swept along. Around 20% of the apparent user base is now aligned with the miner.
5) With segwit still not implemented, one user devises a way to organise the power of all users to force the miners to implement segwit - "UASF". It is well constructed, and scares the miner into meeting with his aspiring courtiers in New York, where they come up with "Segwit2X", a counter-plan to activate Segwit 'on their terms', and which is tied to a 2MB hard fork as per their previous scheme. The miner's new plan is poorly conceived, widely judged to be simultaneously an attempt to further forestall segwit, install a ruling class, and prove the miners' power in the face of the upstart (from their perspective) UASF.
6) The UASF succeeds. To save face and inflict petulant damage on Bitcoin, the miner pays for the creation of a new coin (Bcash) forked from Bitcoin, marketed as 'the real Bitcoin', and quickly rejected by users (today it has the same number of tx in a day that Bitcoin has in 10 minutes). But at least we now have segwit.
7) To nobody's great surprise, the miner and his acolytes push ahead with the 2MB part of their Segwit2X plan, and that's where we are today. They could easily fork from their Bcash chain in a far less dramatic way, but their current plan is to fork from Bitcoin in a deliberately destructive way, which this analogy attempts to illustrate:

Just like any other wallet where you hold the private keys, you get all the fork coins automatically.
The question is really how to split them safely (i.e., how to safeguard your coins from replay attack, since the 2x devs haven't included this). The answer is that services to split coins are in the process of being built, and will be advertised widely when the time comes.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:40:53
You can use your wallet's master public key in most android wallets. Electrum certainly. You can use it to monitor your stash, plus it can generate new addresses for receiving bitcoin, but it can't send anything, so there's no security risk.

Seems great, but you discover that everything you do with the wizardbucks is magically enacted on your real dollars too (e.g. you sell/spend/bin them and your real $$$ disappears also). Additionally they're so hard to distinguish from the real $$$ that people accidentally use/accept one instead of the other.
All we have to do is ignore the wizardbucks, but people are scared easily, this shit's complicated, and the wizard has a fake grassroots campaign in place already.

By virtue of how their fork was structured, every bitcoin (and fraction thereof) in every address entitled its owner to an equal amount of bitcoin cash.
They literally just copied everyone's balances. As means of issuance go, it has benefits (bypasses years of slow adoption) and downsides (confuses noobs - possibly deliberately - resulting in a tarnished reputation. And reputation's all a coin has).

Holding your own private keys means you *should* get both the fork coin and get to keep your bitcoin, but companies associated with the 2X pushers have been saying some very strange things recently.
My advice is to use a wallet that's not connected to 2X, because there's no risk/ambiguity then. Don't want to risk Exodus pulling a Xapo, and claiming you still have all your bitcoin, when what they mean is they stole your bitcoin &amp; replaced it with 2Xcoin, which they now call 'bitcoin'.

Essentially. It's a broker, linking you up with private sellers, whom you interact with through the bittylicious site. Works very smoothly.
You send a bank transfer to the seller, who sends bitcoin the other way. The bank transfer is the slowest part, but the entire transaction usually takes less than 20 minutes.
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:04:00
It's about who owns the private key *at the time of the fork*. Nothing to do with where you bought the coins in question.
If *you* own the key, you are in charge of what you do with each fork's coins. If you entrust key ownership to a 3rd party, they are in charge. And if they have an agenda to push ("Bitcoin is to be replaced by 2xCoin, which will become the new Bitcoin"), you will lose out in whatever way benefits that agenda most.

The reorg attack - on a hypothetical minority 'true Bitcoin' chain, post 2x fork - amounts to mining a longer chain of empty (but **valid**) blocks in secret, then publishing them all at once. Nodes are being used against us in this attack, for they will follow the longer chain, undoing all the transactions in the blocks that are orphaned.
This attack causes chaos, and all the while the 2x (or whatever) chain is working fine. As before, I think it unlikely because of how it reflects on the attackers, who are trying to launch a centralised 'trust *us*' coin, so need to look at least half-way trustworthy. But we shouldn't kid ourselves that it isn't possible.

The name stealing is the scammiest part for sure, but I can't bring myself to feel strongly about it (I've sold all mine of course). It will quickly fall behind code-wise, and there are very few transactions. If people are tricked, they were probably going to lose their BTC anyway.

You have it backwards. Decentralisation is only prized as it is a defence against censorship (defined as stopping you transacting with entities of your own choosing).

1) Hardware wallets only make sense over paper wallets if regular use is your goal. Where they excel, compared to paper wallets, is in signing transactions securely within a PC environment. If you're only hodling, you don't need to worry about such things.
2) I'd buy now, but nobody can give you a definitive answer, because you're asking people to predict the future. If we could do that, we sure as fuck wouldn't be chilling on Reddit.
3) It depends on too many factors for which we have no info. 10% might be very conservative for some, and wildly risky for others. I personally think it's the minimum you should consider, absent more info.

The answer depends on whether you mean for trading, or as useful cryptocurrencies.
I've made good money trading both, Ether in particular, in the past. If I got the impression either was about to shoot up in price, I'd happily buy in. But I don't think much of either of them for non-trading uses.
Litecoin simply duplicates Bitcoin, which isn't *bad* per se, just a little pointless. The people behind it are nice, and the lower profile means they can serve as a halfway house between test nets and Bitcoin proper for new tech (as with segwit).
Ethereum is also interesting. No denying that Vitalik Buterin is an impressive figure, and he &amp; some of the other devs are inventing cool stuff. But... I don't think their coin works. It's not robust, and would crumble under any kind of state pressure in a way Bitcoin would not. Additionally, I don't understand some things - why all the calculations have to happen everywhere, for instance? I think the value will fall away, but much of the tech will live on, to be used in temporary, specialised instances - more like excel than Bitocin.

I think any such responsive changes, made solely to mitigate an outside threat, would certainly not be justification for removing Bitcoin's BTC ticker designation.
It wouldn't be done if e.g. the PoW algorithm had to change in the absence of a fork (say, in response to SHA256 being broken), so would be inappropriate here.
Active, divisive changes might rightly attract such treatment, but defensive changes to protect users cannot be the justification for such treatment. It would establish a precedent that attackers could exploit, and would punish coins simply for seeking to maintain their integrity.

@_date: 2017-10-29 19:46:27
There are upsides and downsides to both, and I guess the better option depends on the real life threat profile you face.
Bitcoin Core downloads the blockchain &amp; verifies tx properly, whereas electrum outsources this to a 3rd party's node (i.e. you have to trust someone, which is bad).
On the other hand, Electrum on TailsOS is far better against attacks involving screen capture, keylogging, and similar.
I go with Electrum-on-TailsOS because I believe I can deal with the downsides of that better. YMMV.

With Bcash &amp; 2x, it's a very small closed shop. Usually people who tried to contribute to Bitcoin but couldn't make the grade are approached by representatives of Jihan &amp; asked to produce stuff to order. The longer their codebases forked from Bitcoin, the more antiquated it becomes.

Whether or not the price of one bitcoin can go to zero, it has nothing to do with people losing their coins.

It's not a good idea to let your private keys touch an everyday OS environment. A hot wallet for spending small sums in windows is okay, but you need to look after your main stash better than that, or it won't be your stash for long.

Censorship in this sense means preventing you from transacting with whomsoever you choose.

The reorg attack would produce a chain that's valid according to the consensus rules. It's point isn't to attempt to break the rules, it's point is to undo a load of transactions, making the chain unusable.
This is basic stuff my man. Do you understand it? Cause if you don't, I can see why we're having such trouble.

@_date: 2017-10-15 17:30:30
You're on the right track. The Copay wallet uses a BIP39-compliant seed I believe, which Samourai can use fine. Either type that into samourai, or send your funds in a transaction (cheap right now) to an address in a newly generated samourai wallet. Either is fine. Best to then remove copay, but only from a 'reduce my attack surface' point of view.
And of course, it's not necessary for your wallet to exist anywhere outside of your seed phrase. So you could delete everything off all your devices, wait 10 years, and your seed phrase would still access your funds on any BIP39-compliant wallet (it's a standard developed deliberately to allow for this, and will be supported far in the future).
My main stash doesn't exist on any device, and I've got the seed phrase memorised. I get a kick out of being able to access such funds directly from my brain, lol.

It would be the same as if some future hypothetical fork removed non-segwit addresses.
Which is to say, nobody would use the new fork, and Bitcoin would carry on regardless.
Not dumb, you're asking the right questions.

Yes to weak, no to acceptance.
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:56:06
Not true. You've picked up on an old r/btc claim. They could fork themselves of the Bitcoin network, create a new coin &amp; steal all the segwit coins on that. But they can't do it on the bitcoin network, even with a majority of hashpower.
But if a bad miner with a majority of hashpower is determined to attack the network, we would just change the proof of work algorithm. Who would use a coin mined by the sort of miner who'd steal Bitcoin in segwit addresses?
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:15:25
Open bitaddress.org and click on "Save Page" to a local HTML file, then disconnect your internet. Open the HTML file &amp; paste your key in the "Wallet Details" tab, which should automagically display the uncompressed version of the key (beginning '5...'). This can hopefully then be swept by Electrum.
Note I've not used bitaddress before, this was just some quick googling. You're right though, best to become familiar with software before real money is involved.
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:22:56
I'd think that whether the wallet people favour Bitcoin or 2x, the reputable thing to do is to make it easy for users to access both, even if you end up only supporting one.

@_date: 2017-10-13 10:51:51
So you believe they're supporting 2x while hoping it fails, to push up the price of BTC?


@_date: 2017-10-21 16:03:52
It's possible. Which is why we like open source. But even then, things can be hidden.

@_date: 2017-10-30 14:44:24
It depends how much we're talking about. I've used all the major Android wallets this year (for fun, geek that I am), and Samourai is my favourite, but I try to keep no more than 0.05 btc on it. Fees aren't bad right now (50 sat/byte takes a few hours), so as I said, it's about your android device. Does it at least have the September security patch? If it's had loads of dodgy apps on it, have you factory restored it? etc.

That's just how the mathematics works - no matter how much time has passed looking for a block, the next one is most likely to appear 10 minutes from 'now'.
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:52:28
You are required, with bitcoin, to make a judgement about how high a fee you want to pay - the higher it is, the quicker the transaction will be processed. But what counts as 'high' varies from day to day.
Without seeing the transaction (you could link to it if you like), I'd guess it will take a few hours to show up in a block.

Recent giant price increases were always going to result in subsequent retractions, that's just how markets work. Additionally, such rises bring attention &amp; hitherto absent regulatory scrutiny to businesses like exchanges operating in legally grey ways (not because they're shady, but because the law is yet to catch up with reality).
China will 'ban' exchanges, the price will tank, some of us will fill our boots, China will reopen exchanges under a suitable legal framework, and the price will rise again.

They're in the wild right now, and while they're not common, it's clear that more and more non-technical people are storing bitcoin on their everyday PCs. It's only a matter of time before they're endemic imho. Best to get ahead of that.
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:01:12
Bitcoin is new. It's volatile, but becoming less and less so as time goes on. There's nothing about the technology that means the value is intrinsically volatile, it's just small in financial terms, so events that would barely register with the US Dollar have a huge impact on Bitcoin.
The bigger Bitcoin gets, the less volatile it will be.
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:27:53
It's not bullshit, but it's talking in a very general way. If you're not using your node to validate your own transactions, it adds nothing to the bitcoin network.
If you run your own node, it doesn't matter whether 7,000, or 7,001 nodes are telling you 'here's a valid transaction'. All that matters is whether *your* node considers it valid.

Because centralisation isn't a binary state, it's a spectrum. I agree we're too centralised right now, but that's no reason to make it fatally worse. Also, cheap transactions and lower fees is one thing, not two.


I don't agree. If those alts had *any real usage at all*, they'd face problems at least as bad as bitcoin faces, without the dev backing to solve them.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:52:57
I'm talking about buying &amp; storing bitcoin yourself. If you leave it on an exchange, you don't really own it.
If I had $100k to invest, I probably *would* keep it in Bitcoin. But my interest in Bitcoin is political, rather than profit-driven.
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:43:17

2X has the potential to kill 95% of nodes within 6 months, according to the best info we have. And it's backed by Larry Summers, an architect of the 2008 global bank heist that inspired Satoshi to launch Bitcoin.
Whatever you think the problem is with 2X, it will kill bitcoin for me if it succeeds.
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:48:51
No. Once you buy bitcoin, no matter where you store it, you own bitcoin. Its price will be whatever the markets say.
Exchanges don't make money from storing your bitcoin (or at least, they shouldn't!), they charge fees for the trades that they facilitate.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:44:52
The answer depends on your various technical competencies. Assuming the worst, and if you're storing more than ~0.5 BTC, a hardware wallet (Trezor or Ledger, not Keepkey) is safest. They not only store your private key, they make spending your bitcoin easier/safer.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:35:32

Effectively everyone follows the users. Only a small handful of idiots mine, develop, or base businesses on coins nobody uses.
So which fork wins will be a clear indicator of user sentiment.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:39:57
Yes, and the outcome will be much like Bcash. That is, a new coin will be born which nobody uses, whose creators will prop it up using their own money until their next attempt at taking over Bitcoin.
Each time they do this people will learn a little more that Bitcoin can't be gainsaid by the power hungry, and the fork coins will be taken a little less seriously (i.e. worth less each time), until it doesn't even register any more.
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:30:10
Copay's about the worst place you could leave it.
Switch to some solution whereby you alone control the private keys, and said keys are not accessible within an everyday PC/phone environment.

Seeds are random lists of between (usually) 12 - 24 words. Some people claim this many random words are hard to remember, but I have an awful memory and can easily remember three different 25-word seeds. You just make a great story out of them.

I know more than my fair share of UK-based financial advisors. They've all known about Bitcoin for years (not much interesting happens in the industry), and whether they align ideologically with it or not, to a man their attitude is "Who cares if it's shit, if shit is rising in price".
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:50:57
You can.
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:55:30
I don't use a hardware wallet, but I probably should (it would make my life easier for sure).
Trezor and Ledger both are highly regarded, and I would have no hesitation using either. The other manufacturer is KeepKey, and I would urge you to stay far away from them - they've been caught doing some very shady things recently (their owners are part of the cartel currently attacking Bitcoin).
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:26:32
It's the bandwidth, not the storage, that's the problem. And 8MB is the maximum, not the actual size (which depends on the number/type of transactions). I feel like you could read up a bit before coming back with better questions - you're smart enough to get what's going on, but haven't acquainted yourself with the details that matter.
@_date: 2017-10-14 11:07:26
Bitcoin use is already restricted to just the rich (the poorest half of the world don't have internet yet). And we already have paypal, if centralised payment networks are your thing.
Censorship resistance is the USP, don't lose sight of that.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:19:27
For Bcash, there's nothing to disrupt.
The attack is: Mine a bunch of empty blocks in secret, then publish them all at once when your secret chain is longer. Nodes will reorganise to follow the longer (empty) chain, and all transactions included in the (now orphaned) blocks are undone.
There's no problem pulling it off, but it does require that other people are actually using the chain in question.
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:37:12
There are a few different standards, and most wallets only support one. I think Samourai (an Android wallet) supports them all, so if possible you could try that? Just download it and enter your seed when prompted.
One thing to be aware of though - typing your seed anywhere is risky. If there's lots of money involved, try to do this safely. An ancient android phone with loads of obscure apps is probably a bad idea, for instance. Windows is similarly risky. So have a plan to move your coins somewhere safe asap.

You have to contact the exchange, not post on a forum. But it could simply be that they e.g. process all the day's transactions in a single batch, and it's just about waiting for that to happen.

By that time we'll have extra layers built on top of bitcoin, meaning far fewer transactions need to be recorded on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:24:34

@_date: 2017-10-18 17:57:28
Worth reading until you understand how bitcoin works, at least on a superficial level. But that's not what most seem to do, so:
Register on an exchange (Gemini is best in US, bl3p.eu in Europe, imho), verify yourself with them, transfer some money from your bank, place your order, send your bitcoin to a safe place.
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:50:16
You can have an nlocktime backup transaction with a 2 of 2 wallet (meaning you don't need their help), but good info otherwise - a 2 of 3 wallet is probably better.

I don't own a hardware wallet, but if I did, it would be blank. Every time I needed to use it, I'd enter the seed phrase, sign the transactions, then hit factory reset.
For me they are solely devices designed to make using Bitcoin on an everyday PC safer (by keeping private keys off the PC).
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:02:07
Smaller than the inter-day price changes, lol. I usually get bitcoin in my wallet, all fees included, for 1-1.5% of market price.
There's no doubt that overall, I probably end up paying about 5% more than I'd pay with fiat (as you would changing into any foreign currency). But I end up with slightly more bitcoin than before, and I help to expand the Bitcoin economy - this in my mind has helped push the price of BTC up, meaning my 5% premium was easily worth it in strict profit/loss terms.
@_date: 2019-09-30 19:21:11
There's no actual info given, so it's hard to be specific about if/how it fails, but something like this comes along every few months, and it's always the same trick:

It depends on your own situation. Invest only what you can afford to lose, etc.
But I've tried (and largely failed) to convince my real-world friends to try to buy at least 1BTC. So 3k would be a good start.
@_date: 2017-10-07 20:28:32
I've posted this previously-
Bitcoin devs came up with a cool bit of tech to improve Bitcoin (Segwit - it increases capacity makes a bunch of new features easy to implement). Unbeknown to those devs, this improvement inadvertently neutralised a neat trick the largest miner had come up with to make his mining more efficient (which equals more profit).
This same miner had for some time harboured ambitions to rule Bitcoin. He was putting tens of millions into infrastructure, unlike users/devs/etc, and couldn't understand why he wasn't consequently in charge of the whole system.
He hatched a plan intended to stall the implementation of Segwit, a plan which over time grew to include the goal of displacing the open/decentralised dev structure, and installing himself as king. He met with some Bitcoin devs in Hong Kong, agreeing to implement segwit if the devs would also code-up a change from 1MB to 2MB blocks. Under this proposal, Segwit would be a soft fork, and the 2MB bump would happen as a hard fork if it gained the support of the users. The devs began coding for segwit, but support for the 2MB hard fork was absent (the downsides far outweigh any benefit - users saw that 2MB blocks make it easier for a ruling class to install itself).
The miner, rich on his secretly buffed profits, embarked on a spending spree. He bought healthy stakes in many of the most prominent players in the Bitcoin ecosystem (who changed overnight from user-supporting to miner-supporting positions). He also attracted certain individuals who own lots of bitcoin, and who also long for Bitcoin to acquire a ruling class.
Angered by the community's refusal to accede to his 2MB fork, and eager to continue to enjoy his secret buff, the miner came out against Segwit (which had been designed to be activated by the miners).
Together the wannabe-bosses began building a largely faked support (there exists much evidence of huge paid-for tweeting programmes and the like - there's actual billions at stake remember). Some useful idiots, unable to see how Bitcoin works and easily swayed by tough-talking strongmen, were swept along. Around 20% of the apparent user base is now aligned with the miner.
With segwit still not implemented, one user devised a way to organise the power of all users to force the miners to implement segwit - this method was named "UASF" (or BIP148). It was well constructed, and scared the miner into meeting with his aspiring courtiers in New York, where they came up with "Segwit2X", a counter-plan to activate Segwit 'on their terms', which is tied to a 2MB hard fork as per their previous scheme. The miner's new plan was poorly conceived, widely judged to be simultaneously an attempt to further forestall segwit, install a ruling class, and prove the miners' power in the face of the upstart (from their perspective) UASF.
The UASF succeeded. To save face and inflict petulant damage on Bitcoin, the miner then paid for the creation of a new coin (Bcash) forked from Bitcoin, marketed as 'the real Bitcoin', and quickly rejected by users (today it has the same number of tx in a day that Bitcoin has in 10 minutes). But at least we now have segwit.
To nobody's great surprise, the miner and his acolytes are now pushing ahead with the 2MB part of their Segwit2X plan, and that's where we are today. They could easily fork from their own Bcash chain in a far less dramatic way, but their current plan is to fork from Bitcoin in a deliberately destructive way, which this analogy attempts to illustrate:
Imagine some sorcerer could have every American wake up one day to find that each dollar bill they'd owned at bed time had been joined in their wallets by a wizardly duplicate. Seems great, but you discover that everything you do with the wizardbucks is magically enacted on your real dollars too (e.g. you sell/spend/bin them and your real $$$ disappears also). Additionally they're so hard to distinguish from the real $$$ that people accidentally use/accept one instead of the other.
All we have to do is ignore the wizardbucks, but people are scared easily, this shit's complicated, and the wizard has a fake grassroots campaign in place already.

@_date: 2017-10-24 15:41:30
Of course it's possible. You have 51% of hashpower.
If the chain you're trying to kill has 30% of pre-fork hashpower, you just allocate a little more than that to secretly mine, wait until your secret chain is a few blocks higher, and then transmit all the blocks at once to the network.
This would make the chain unusable until it changed PoW.

Electrum is a bitcoin wallet, I doubt very much it'll also become a 2x wallet.
It's not possible to know exactly what you'll have to do, as the 2x codebase keeps changing, so solutions cannot yet be finalised.
I'd guess it will be something like a webpage wherein we specify a return address for the BTC, and either a return address for the 2x coins, or a checkbox saying 'dump these shitcoins at market price &amp; add the balance to my btc return address'. Then we send the btc &amp; 2x coins in a transaction (which is auto-replayed), and receive coin(s) back shortly after.

The important thing is to get your bitcoin out of any web-based wallet where you have a password and they have the private keys.

Core would base any proposal on evidence.
Since that evidence would have to include a study of segwit's impact, and since many big players haven't yet upgraded their processes to use segwit, no core proposal for 2MB blocks will occur in time.

The main QC threat against bitcoin is to attack the elliptical curve cryptography (the hashrate is just too high for a plausible QC 51% attack).
That is, when a transaction is broadcast, you use your QC to determine the private key from the signature. You can then broadcast a new high-fee transaction sending the UTXO(s) to an address of your choice.
Assuming a quantum computer clocked at 10GHz, with 500,000 qubits and a low error rate, you would need about 30 mins to crack bitcoin's algorithm.
We're *decades* away from a serious threat.

I've used all the big android wallets in the last six months, and would go with electrum or samourai.
Even better though, since you're only hodling, would be to generate a new wallet using electrum-on-tailsOS, then export the master public key for use in an android wallet.
This way you'd have an ultra-safe seed stored someplace (i.e. 12 words you write down &amp; memorize), and a phone wallet showing your balance, which can also generate new addresses/QR codes to receive payment.
If you ever need to spend, just enter the 12 word seed. Until that point, your coins remain about as safe as they would be on a hardware wallet.

If we move too early, we will cause huge losses to the large number of 'good' miners who just want to do their jobs for the network.
This would be extremely damaging to Bitcoin, far more so than waiting to see if the majority chain decides to attack the minority one (which will likely be obvious some time before it happens). By waiting we'd secure the moral high ground, and users would be left with a choice - use a coin whose miners would stoop so low, and who are consequently unfit for duty, or use a coin backed by the vast majority of competent developers, whose miners have behaved unimpeachably.

My opinion is that the new coin is an attempt to hoodwink people into believing that it, the new coin, is the original bitcoin.
The people behind it want to be in charge of bitcoin. They tried in the summer, and it didn't work (they created what's now known as Bcash). I actually think that each attempt they try will do worse than the previous one, until people stop paying attention to them.
They're apparently burning through $500,000 a month in advertising/astroturfing, which seems like a lot, but I guess the potential reward is so large that it's a worthwhile stake, in gambling terms.

I've used both shapeshift and changelly extensively.
Changelly's just cheaper across the board (though don't look at their rates for fiat). Shapeshift has a nicer UX, but I'd expect that gap to narrow (it's not huge anyway).
Usually you're playing off your head vs your heart in these choices, but Changelly's cheaper **and** supports users against the corporate takeover attempts.

@_date: 2019-09-09 10:10:07
A 51% attack is about as serious as it gets, but even then, the design of bitcoin means defence is orders of magnitude easier than attack.
In your scenario, an already weakened state throws resources it barely has into a last-ditch attempt to control hashpower. But this vast outlay, and the machines it delivers to an attacker, can be rendered instantly pointless - nodes need only upgrade to a revised protocol with an altered hashing algorithm. Sure, this isn't a walk in the park - but as a response to the attack you describe, it maintains the asymmetry of defence being much easier than attack.
It seems much more likely that if any power acquired the ability to 51% attack bitcoin, they would quickly realise that it was hugely in their interests to keep the blocks flowing as users demand. Because once you've sunk that much into dominating mining, you can only lose more than you'd gain by rocking the boat.

@_date: 2017-10-22 12:36:36
The downsides more than eclipse any upside unfortunately.
Hashrate is the important thing, and you can divide it across more blocks if you like, each block will then just be worth less. So two 10-minute blocks afford as much certainty as four 5-minute blocks.
Plus problems like geographical concentration come into play.

You're talking about trading. You'd get better advice on r/BitcoinMarkets.
I personally think that unless you're an experienced &amp; well-backed trader, you should just buy &amp; hold (maybe spend too, but always buy-back immediately).

You're going to feel silly. There's no need for the childish stuff, even if you were right.
The attacker just uses as much of his hashpower as is necessary to pull off the reorg attack (i.e. a little more than his opponent), and uses the rest, however little, to run his new chain.
Result? One working chain - his.
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:40:23
The short answer is maths. A transaction really amounts to somebody using a private key to unlock some bitcoin, and using a public key (which is related to the recipient's address) to lock it back up again.
The nodes check that this has been done correctly, and that the block contains only valid transactions, and doesn't err in other ways (e.g. too big). Any block that fails the checks is rejected, and it's as if that block was never mined.

What sorts of rule change might Bitcoin undergo, in response to 2x, that make you bring it up?
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:09:46
A replay attack is just where you take a transaction broadcast on one network (e.g. the future 2x network), and 'replay it', i.e. broadcast it again, on another network (e.g. bitcoin).
Since the same info is being signed by the same private key(s) on each network, the signed transaction is identical on each network.
So you can't change the amount or destination address or anything like that.

You're confusing what your wallet software suggests as a fee, with what bitcoin actually requires. Also, viewing fees as a percentage of the sum transacted is likely to give you the wrong picture - you could send a $1 billion transaction for the same $1.06.

Yep, but you have to keep the maximum size below that which, should an attacker find a way to inflate the blocks with carefully crafted filler, will cause nodes to run out of bandwidth.

You're inappropriately certain of this point. A plausible reason would be 'signalling 2x because they agreed to as part of NYA &amp; to keep Jihan pacified, but since NYA has already been broken and the code is shonkey as fuck, you run whatever stable mining software you like'.

I like Bcash because I prefer knowing that there's just one miner to approach if things go wrong.
It's even better that nowhere accepts it, because it means I get to save up all my coins, rather than being tempted to spend them. 
The price has dropped too, meaning they're more affordable for the average person, while elitist Bitcoin keeps rising in value.
And transactions on Bcash are so quick to confirm. Nobody uses Bitcoin now it's so popular.

Also what I've been telling you. For ages now. And you still don't seem to get it, even when your own sources make *my* case.
It doesn't talk about a hypothetical changed consensus rule because that's not the subject. But there's no reason a Jihan character couldn't also be launching his 'new rules coin' in a 2x-esque way, as the transactions on the original chain grind to a halt under a reorg attack.

'Main address'?
If your money is indeed from illegal sources, you need to read a lot, soon, about how bitcoin works. Address re-use is your enemy in Bitcoin.
But no, any shuffling of currencies on a single exchange adds no anonymity.
Assuming you were just giving me a hypothetical reason for your otherwise laudable commitment to privacy- I'd send Monero from Binance to e.g. changelly, where you switch back to bitcoin, and on to addresses you control. This would take many transactions though. Perhaps a naughtier person knows better ways.

Empty blocks are not a good thing. A small fee (resulting from competition for space) is desirable, otherwise bad actors could vastly inflate the blockchain for little cost.

A bubble is when people get too excited, buy like crazy, realise they've pushed the price up too high, then sell off causing the price to plummet back to a reasonable level.
I have a hard time believing that the same people inflating the values of e.g. Ripple &amp; Dash (two unarguable shitcoins) are somehow avoiding doing the same to Bitcoin. I think if you removed their influence, the BTC price would be lower.
(so to be clear, Bitcoin has followed the first half of the bubble definition, but it ain't a bubble if it doesn't pop).

No. Non-2x wallets are all neutral, they will continue to provide access to your bitcoin, and you will be able to get your 2x coins too.
This is all a problem owing to the lack of replay protection in the 2x fork (a dick move). Wait until after the fork, and there will be instructions on how to separate your coins. Don't make any other trades until your coins are safely split.

That's one way, but kinda the lame way. The *real* way to beat bitcoin would be to make proper use of monetary policy levers to smooth out cyclical variance in the macroeconomy. I.e. to do what governments *pretend* they are doing when they futz with rates &amp; the money supply. Not *harder* (in fact softer), but *smarter*.
Bitcoin establishes a baseline, ensuring governments cannot inflict as much harm on citizens' wealth as they could with a fiat-only system. Beating this baseline using the available range of interventions is entirely possible, and should be the goal of any government. But we are, of course, very fucking far from that shit.

Well, if Bitcoin replaces fiat (e.g. for everyday spending - it's unlikely to displace it entirely), you will need to pay for food &amp; shelter at a minimum. And you'll be getting any income paid in BTC. So it seems likely you'll have to spend BTC.

Ah, that's a *very* low fee you've set. There's nothing wrong with that, it's kinda the equivalent of picking the slowest shipping option. It's cheaper, so it takes longer. It also coincides with a large spike in transaction volume, so a 'perfect storm' of slowness if you will.
If there's a rush to get this money paid, there may be (paid-for) options to speed the transaction up. Otherwise you just have to wait.
Can I ask how your fee was calculated? I mean, did you set it, or did a wallet/etc. suggest it?

You're right to take your coins off coinbase, they are showing all the signs of turning bad, and in Bitcoin, that means your coins are at risk.
You will get the 2x coins if you hold your own private keys.
Do not store your private keys in your everyday computing environment. Options like hardware wallets, paper wallets, and electrum-on-TailsOS should be chosen instead (the latter two if you're simply hodling/spending infrequently, the former if you're spending more often).

Say you're sending your newly airdropped 2x coins to a new 2x address that you own. Without replay protection, that 2x transaction is *identical* to a Bitcoin transaction that sends your bitcoin (signed by the same private key as your 2x coin) to the same address as the 2x transaction. But you don't have the private key to the Bitcoin address, you only have the key for the 2x address.
All some malicious person has to do is broadcast your 2x transaction over the Bitcoin network, and your bitcoin will end up in an address for which nobody has the key.
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:40:10
None of these forks are updates to Bitcoin - they simply create new cryptocurrencies based on Bitcoin's code. They don't affect Bitcoin's credibility, because they aren't Bitcoin.
If I made little go-kart out of a wooden box and some pram wheels, and claimed it was the new Rolls Royce, that wouldn't hurt Rolls Royce's credibility. The same applies here (though I get why you say it - the forkers are currently spending $500k a month on ads/'grassroots support' to persuade you the new coins are related to Bitcoin. They aren't).
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:08:15
As a rule, never store your bitcoin on a website. You'll lose it.
A hardware wallet is a great idea. In the meantime, if it helps you sleep at night, you can send your coins to an Electrum-on-TailsOS wallet (which is in the same league, security-wise, as a hardware wallet, but free).

I personally would go all in now, then dump the 2x coins immediately after the fork. 2x will be the latest in a long line of failed attacks. This is certain, because 2x attempts to remove the only thing that makes Bitcoin interesting to begin with.

I'm sure some people forget their passwords, if that's what you mean.
Burning bitcoin means sending to an address for which there is no known private key. People sometimes do it when a new token is made, as a symbolic way of committing value to the future of that token (look up how counterparty started, for instance).

PoW provides security/assurance that those telling you 'this transaction happened' are on the level, and that this truth won't change at some point down the line.
You're asking the right questions. The best thing you could do at this point is read up on the 'Nakamoto consensus'. Satoshi's genius was to give each player in the system a stake, such that it's in each participant's interests to keep the system working correctly. It's the key innovation, and vital to understanding how Bitcoin works. People who don't understand it can be identified by their characteristic call "Blockchain! Blockchain!".

Yes, but the term fork is being used in a different sense there. Litecoin is run on a fork of the Bitcoin codebase- they took the code (it's open source, so that's cool), made some changes (faster blocktime, more coins, etc.), then started mining from a 'genesis block'. A brand new currency, issued organically by miners (who sell it to pay for their costs).
Bcash, 2X et al. are different in that they fork both the codebase *and* the blockchain/utxo set/etc., so that instead of starting their own chain from the beginning, they essentially photocopy everybody's bitcoin. Everyone wakes up one day with bitcoin, plus a duplicate with altered rules.
The latter method is not wrong per se (it short-circuits the problem of getting the tokens into people's hands, which can take years), but it comes both with a faint air of illegitimacy compared with the former method, and certain responsibilities (maybe not the right word) not to fuck with the original currency.
If some sorcerer could have every American wake up one day to find that each dollar bill they'd owned at bed time had been joined in their wallets by a wizardly duplicate, there'd be certain dick-moves he could pull: Maybe everything you do with the wizardbucks is magically enacted on your dollars too (e.g. you sell/spend/bin them and your $ disappears also). Or maybe the wizardbucks are so hard to distinguish from the real ones that people accidentally accept one instead of the other.
If the creators of Bcash or 2x pull stunts like this (right now the 2x people are threatening such tactics, Bcash backed down after promising similar), they'll only be confirming that they're not to be trusted &amp; are attacking Bitcoin rather than starting a genuine currency.
To make such a fork happen, which was maybe your question, you just have to mine an invalid block - one that doesn't accord with the rules - and keep building on top of it while the rest of the network, who all ignored the invalid block, follows the valid chain.

Addresses don't really exist in that way - 'existing on the chain'. The address represents a number used to 'lock up' the bitcoin. Spending those coins requires the address's corresponding private key.

You can, but fees will be a significant percentage unless you find a way to buy that allows you to specify the tx fee.

The ban is of ICOs. Bitcoin never had an ICO. Sharp falls are a speciality of Bitcoin, and this one was most likely a consolidation after a crazy run up to $5,000, nothing to do with China's ICO decision (which is not really a surprise or a very bad thing).

The value of your investment could go up or down. Most here believe it will go up (I think £100k per bitcoin by the end of 2021 is very possible).
But you won't gain BTC. Instead your BTC amount stays fixed, and its purchasing power goes up. E.g. If you buy £100 worth (say 0.11 btc), and the bitcoin price rises by 100%, you'll have £200 worth of BTC, but it will still be 0.11 btc.

There is no ambiguity, except for that which your scheme would introduce.
2x is a contentious fork. Until such time as it's chain has a steady majority of Bitcoin's users, it can only be seen as a challenger to the incumbent. Otherwise we could easily make all tickers useless.
You're attempting to open an attack vector, whether deliberately or otherwise.
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:09:00
Segwit as implemented in Bitcoin allows for a total block size equalling four times the size of the transaction data. So with 1MB of tx data, as we have now, blocks can be no larger than 4MB. With 2MB of tx data (as 2X aims to provide), blocks can be no larger than 8MB. FYI, the other data is mostly the cryptographic signature info (the 'witness'), which is now segregated away from the tx data.
In normal use, it's not possible to get to 4 times the size, and blocks will likely peak out around 3.2MB if tx data is limited to 1MB. But the nature of Bitcoin is you can't design it for 'normal use', you have to assume the worst (just as the chief consideration when designing bank vaults isn't ease of ingress/egress).


Nodes currently hit around 300GB a month. Under 2X, worst case, that could be over 2TB a month. Bitcoin would be largely restricted to data centres, and governments could far more easily 'kick the doors down'.
What you must understand - the guiding principle for core devs - is that Bitcoin must remain uncensorable. They will not do anything which moves the current balance even slightly in the wrong direction on this, nor should they. Too many in the ecosystem have lost sight of this in the name of making money, and ironically, it's the only thing making Bitcoin worth a damn to begin with.

LN consolidates many transactions (potentially millions) into two on-chain transactions.

Trust/trustlessness can never be entirely pure in real life (which could simply be a simulation of some vastly superior intelligence, after all).

The exact opposite is true. Bits is simply too common a word, with meanings that overlap this proposed new definition in confusing ways (bits is already a unit for measuring data - using it for a different property of data will never take off).
Even if there were good reasoning for this term, we've already tried &amp; it was rejected. Because it turns out, you can't force any of this name stuff - it has to emerge naturally from everyday interaction, or it will not take root.
Maybe you're right about 'sats' being a bad choice in some ways. But it is here to stay.

Bear in mind that if blocks came every ~1 minute, we'd still have to wait an hour for the same level of security as six 10-minute blocks.

(I just left this comment on another post)-
The main QC threat against bitcoin is to attack the elliptical curve cryptography (the hashrate is just too high for a plausible QC 51% attack).
That is, when a transaction is broadcast, you use your QC to determine the private key from the signature. You can then broadcast a new high-fee transaction sending the UTXO(s) to an address of your choice.
Assuming a quantum computer clocked at 10GHz, with 500,000 qubits and a low error rate, you would need about 30 mins to crack bitcoin's algorithm.
We're decades away from a serious threat.

It's working right now, but not in a bug-free way, so don't trust large sums to any implementation yet. These bugs are relatively trivial. There's no time line when breaking new ground, and it's not like a binary working/not working situation- the range of suitable purposes will slowly expand as bugs disappear and features are added.
There are some issues (e.g. efficient routing) which seem very difficult to solve to me, but which may not actually matter in practice.

You can't *send* bitcoin offline, because sending involves telling the network about your transaction.

You hand over $100, and are given $75 in change.

Bitcoin is a relatively immature &amp; tiny market, but has a huge profile. Additionally, the traditional methods that traders use to inform their choices break down, or are more readily game-able, in a bitcoin context.
The result is a more volatile market, which is slowly becoming more stable as bitcoin grows relative to the rest of the economy. Bitcoin, by virtue of its predictable issuance and the diversity of uses to which it will be put, will eventually be much more stable than *any* previous asset.
But the decades between now and then will be choppy for sure.

Apologies for the length of this, which I've posted before. You can't really understand 2x without this background.
Bitcoin devs came up with a cool bit of tech to improve Bitcoin (Segwit - it increases capacity &amp; makes a bunch of new features easy to implement). Unbeknown to those devs, this improvement inadvertently neutralised a neat trick the largest miner had come up with to make his mining more efficient (which equals more profit). This same miner had for some time harboured ambitions to rule Bitcoin. He was putting tens of millions into infrastructure, unlike users/devs/etc, and couldn't understand why he wasn't consequently in charge of the whole system.
He hatched a plan intended to stall the implementation of Segwit, a plan which over time grew to include the goal of displacing the open/decentralised dev structure, and installing himself as king. He met with some Bitcoin devs in Hong Kong, agreeing to implement segwit if the devs would also code-up a change from 1MB to 2MB blocks. Under this proposal, Segwit would be a soft fork, and the 2MB bump would happen as a hard fork if it gained the support of the users. The devs began coding for segwit, but support for the 2MB hard fork was absent (the downsides far outweigh any benefit - users saw that 2MB blocks make it easier for a ruling class to install itself). The miner, rich on his secretly buffed profits, embarked on a spending spree. He bought healthy stakes in many of the most prominent players in the Bitcoin ecosystem (who changed overnight from user-supporting to miner-supporting positions). He also attracted certain individuals who own lots of bitcoin, and who also long for Bitcoin to acquire a ruling class.
Angered by the community's refusal to accede to his 2MB fork, and eager to continue to enjoy his secret buff, the miner came out against Segwit (which had been designed to be activated by the miners). Together the wannabe-bosses began building a largely faked support (there exists much evidence of huge paid-for tweeting programmes and the like - there's actual billions at stake remember). Some useful idiots, unable to see how Bitcoin works and easily swayed by tough-talking strongmen, were swept along. Around 20% of the apparent user base is now aligned with the miner.
With segwit still not implemented, one user devised a way to organise the power of all users to force the miners to implement segwit - this method was named "UASF" (or BIP148). It was well constructed, and scared the miner into meeting with his aspiring courtiers in New York, where they came up with "Segwit2X", a counter-plan to activate Segwit 'on their terms', which is tied to a 2MB hard fork as per their previous scheme. The miner's new plan was poorly conceived, widely judged to be simultaneously an attempt to further forestall segwit, install a ruling class, and prove the miners' power in the face of the upstart (from their perspective) UASF.
The UASF succeeded. To save face and inflict petulant damage on Bitcoin, the miner then paid for the creation of a new coin (Bcash) forked from Bitcoin, marketed as 'the real Bitcoin', and quickly rejected by users (today it has the same number of tx in a day that Bitcoin has in 10 minutes). But at least we now have segwit. To nobody's great surprise, the miner and his acolytes are now pushing ahead with the 2MB part of their Segwit2X plan, and that's where we are today. They could easily fork from their own Bcash chain in a far less dramatic way, but their current plan is to fork from Bitcoin in a deliberately destructive way, which this analogy attempts to illustrate:
Imagine some sorcerer could have every American wake up one day to find that each dollar bill they'd owned at bed time had been joined in their wallets by a wizardly duplicate. Seems great, but you discover that everything you do with the wizardbucks is magically enacted on your real dollars too (e.g. you sell/spend/bin them and your real $$$ disappears also). Additionally they're so hard to distinguish from the real $$$ that people accidentally use/accept one instead of the other.
All we have to do is ignore the wizardbucks, but people are scared easily, this shit's complicated, and the wizard has a fake grassroots campaign in place already.

(I'm just leaving this comment on every one of today's QC FUD posts)-
The main QC threat against bitcoin is to attack the elliptical curve cryptography (the hashrate is just too high for a plausible QC 51% attack).
That is, when a transaction is broadcast, you use your QC to determine the private key from the signature. You can then broadcast a new high-fee transaction sending the UTXO(s) to an address of your choice. But you have to do all this before the first transaction - the one you're attacking - gets confirmations.
Assuming a quantum computer clocked at 10GHz, with 500,000 qubits and a low error rate, you would need about 30 mins to crack bitcoin's algorithm.
We're decades away from a serious threat.

The bigger the blocks, the fewer people can run nodes, the easier it is to shut down. My estimation is that 2MB blocks (i.e. 8MB total size with segwit) is too large for safety.
Additionally, if a handful of individuals can force changes on Bitcoin, the system is too weak to resist our most powerful adversaries.

You probably pick the two most interesting of the alts. I've owned both in the past, but only have a small amount of Monero currently.
I like Monero in some ways (fungibility/privacy), dislike it in others (scaling). It is in my opinion the second best coin after Bitcoin, and their community is enviably clear-headed. My guess is it's underpriced compared to all the other alts, it's the only altcoin I would confidently say that about.
Ethereum is fascinating. I fundamentally don't buy that the macro-design of it works, though smarter people than me, and whom I admire, disagree. Some of the tech they're coming up with is cool, and will persist beyond what I imagine to be the forthcoming slow death of the currency itself. I think it will be dogged by insecurity &amp; ultimately be viewed as a solution in want of a problem. I don't understand why the price of an ether is so high, but it's by far a minor offender in this regard (wtf is the price of Ripple about?).

There's no correlation between the value of the bitcoin being transferred and the fee.
The fee is related to the size in bytes that the transaction takes up in a block. In this case, since the transaction was consolidating lots of UTXOs, the amount of data to be recorded was quite large.
$10 is still likely overpaying, though given the sums involved, I can see why you'd treat yourself to a next-block confirmation.

Yeah (except I wouldn't sell, but that's just me). Bitcoin isn't really yours unless you hold the private keys, as people have discovered to their cost.
The next thing you need to figure out is how to hold it *securely*. As a basic rule, if you've got more than 0.05 BTC and you're storing your keys within windows, you're taking too much risk. Read up on hardware wallets, paper wallets, &amp; GreenAddress wallets, at a minimum, before figuring out what's right for you.

Send your btc from your electrum wallet to your ledger, then put your old wallet's seed phrase into electron cash (or something like that, it's a Bcash version of electrum). You can then hodl your Bcash or (more sensibly) change them at e.g. changelly for btc.
The next forks haven't yet occurred, so it's the ideal time to do this. Instructions for the next forks will be available when the time comes.

Dash is a privacy coin with a fundamentally broken privacy model. Ethereum is interesting tech in many ways, but is structured such that it's almost impossible to put it to its intended use securely, is not immutable, has a leader to attack/corrupt/threaten, and doesn't quite make sense (i.e., it's more like excel than Bitcoin - why would anyone want all these calculations done on all nodes? Surely temporary, isolated instances of Ethereum make more sense?).

'A given population' - no need to secure 3.5% of the global population, especially given the disparate/unlinked economies involved.. If some rich country (US, Germany, Japan, etc.) or a collection of poorer ones were to reach 3.5%, that would likely fulfil the requirement.

There are assholes everywhere of course, but most instances I see where a noob complains about their experience are something other than simple toxicity.
Bitcoin is complicated and lots of people whose talents lie outside the world of systems &amp; logic simply get frustrated. Many of these will remain unhappy until ~~idiot proof~~ suitable solutions (with inevitable trade-offs) appear.
Other noobs bimble in with altcoiner talking points they've picked up innocently elsewhere (remember how much e.g. bcash propaganda is deliberately misleading). These poor chumps get mistaken for full-blown bcash nuts, and receive short shrift. I'm not sure this is a bad thing, long-term, if the right tone is struck.
But fundamentally, Bitcoin is *different*. It prompts people to consider their relationship to the world around them anew, or perhaps even for the first time. This is rarely a happy experience, at least in the beginning. Until noobs have acclimatised, there will inevitably arise a feeling that bitcoin is somehow toxic. Because in the context of the worldview foist on them by our current systems, it really is.

With a paper wallet you are well placed to avoid any shenanigans. The real threat is to users with bitcoin stored with the companies listed - these companies literally plan to sell their customers' bitcoin and replace it with equal amounts of a new altcoin.

@_date: 2017-10-26 16:32:03
All I do is make my purchase, then at some point that day buy the BTC back (I usually buy 105% of what I've spent, so it slowly adds to the stash).
I would add that, as with any currency exchange, you're likely to pay more than you would paying in fiat currency. But Bitcoin's gains more than compensate for that, and it's easy to convince yourself the gains wouldn't happen if you weren't out there, boosting vendor adoption.
@_date: 2018-07-29 17:47:08

I get the impression that lots of noobs are just using software wallets on windows &amp; android and assuming they're safe, so the fact you're even thinking about this stuff puts you ahead of the 'low hanging fruit'.
But hardware wallets are great, and unmatched if you want to spend as well as hodl. If not spending, things like Electrum on TailsOS, paper wallets, greenaddress's offline stuff, are all acceptable.

Their power derives from the seriousness with which the community treats them. These fork attacks will (I hope) slowly teach users to treat all alts made this way (i.e. with malicious intent) with the same light-hearted derision you'd employ on anyone saying "hi, I'm Jesus, and also swap your bad money for my good special new money now please".
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:22:44
A replay attack is just where you take a transaction broadcast on one network (e.g. the future 2x network), and 'replay it', i.e. broadcast it again, on another network (e.g. bitcoin).
So you end up sending coins of two different currencies, on two different networks. It's an attack on cryptocurrency use in general.
The 2x pushers' failure to include basic and easily implemented protection against this is a massive red flag for 2x. You can no longer plausibly confuse them with 'good actors with positive intentions'.

Never used bitfinex, and probably never will, but I tell you what - the amount of shit that gets thrown at them initially made me wary. As time has gone by, however, and as the wild accusations have proven to be unfounded over and over, I've come to suspect that the *real* problem others have is that it works, and works well.
They had a giant hack, and if I remember right, paid customers every last satoshi back. They get their banks closed down and somehow seamlessly continue to work perfectly.
To get around more bank fuckery, they created tether. Despite howls of anguish and gnashing of teeth, tether just keeps on doing what it does. The banker/regulator nexus seize the funds backing tether, and bitfinex instantly respond to keep users safe.
Like I said, I'll probably never use any of their services. But I do admire their resolve, can-do attitude, and balls - in the face of propaganda campaigns and banking blockades - to keep their fat on-ramp open. Never say never, but I think if they were bad actors they'd have behaved very differently, and certainly have had all the excuses they needed to run off with armfulls of cash..

Blockchain hype is nonsense. People are spending hundreds of millions to discover that actually, all blockchains are good for is recording the transmission/ownership of native, value-bearing tokens.
You can fit small amounts of extra stuff in there (timestamps, parts of ID verification systems, and such), but without native, value-bearing tokens, blockchains are not interesting.
In any case I don't understand how this gives a bitcoin more intrinsic value. In fact the opposite is the case - the existing value of a bitcoin makes storing data within its systems attractive (since the value implies a greater likelihood of permanence).

The point about web wallets is correct, you need to control your own private keys. If you don't, the businesses who do will decide what happens to your coins. Because the naughty miner has bought lots of these businesses, that amounts to "they'll sell your BTC for whatever shitcoin they wish, and insist that your new coins *are* BTC". There will be years of litigation, and these businesses are usually based in countries where applicable laws are hard to enforce.

What happens to the attacker's chain is not relevant, they've succeeded in their attack from my perspective, as a user.
But hypothetically, I'd wager that before a DoS could happen, enough of the 49% would defect to the only working chain (to keep businesses going, to shush the clamour from the attacker's acolytes &amp; the useful idiots that get swept along).
Certainly nobody would tolerate a month or two of reorgs. Something like an emergency PoW change would be required, and the attack would be thwarted.

Replay protection is any technology that prevents replay attacks. Replay attacks are when somebody takes a transaction broadcast on one cryptocurrency's network, and broadcasts it on another currency's network.

I don't, and guides to this sort of thing have a habit of ageing disgracefully.
Can you at least download TailsOS, burn a bootable disc &amp; have a look at how it works? You can do this without any cost/risk, it takes 5 minutes, and it's pretty simple. Come back when you're able to generate a seed phrase, but before you send bitcoin anywhere!
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:42:57
If you're simply hodling/buying, a paper wallet is a far better idea. Or a GreenAddress wallet. Or Electrum-on-TailsOS. If you're spending frequently too, a hardware wallet is highly recommended, but Electrum-on-TailOS is workable.

Golf? Are you just trying to drive a wedge between us?
It has already been shown to be full of holes.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:07:28
Slightly misunderstanding.
Electrum derives key pairs (which are essentially addresses plus the ability to spend from them) from a seed phrase it randomly generates. On (e.g.) windows the Electrum program then saves the wallet as a .dat file ('wallet.dat'), which you password-protect. But you can delete the wallet.dat file, format your hard-drive/whatever, and as long as you know the seed phrase, any instance of Electrum - on any platform - will be able to rebuild your wallet &amp; access your bitcoin.
So on TailsOS, you generate the seed, and with it the associated addresses, to which you send your bitcoin. You then close TailsOS (wiping all record of your wallet from the computer's RAM), and keep the seed safe. When you want to access the funds, boot into TailsOS and enter your seed phrase.
The whole point about using TailsOS is that you don't have to trust in the security of your windows installation, and there's nothing for any virus/etc. to find.
The important thing is, don't forget your seed. I've got mine written down safely, but also memorised - short of some kind of brain injury/cognitive illness I will never forget it. There's no feeling like walking around with bitcoin in your head :-)
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:43:07

Your seed = your wallet (as long as you haven't imported additional private keys). Persistence just means you don't have to enter your seed each time, because you save some data locally.
You can enter your seed in any instance of Electrum (e.g. on windows, android, tails, etc.) and it will open your wallet. Again, this only applies if all private keys are derived from your seed, i.e. you've not imported any additional keys (you'll know if you've done this, not something you'd do unwittingly).
The guide you link to is old enough to be obsolete, and is of little use. Electrum has been part of TailsOS for a few years now.

The best thing you could do right now is to read &amp; learn. This tech isn't very easy to use yet, and there are many ways to lose your coins.
If you just want to lock it up safely (i.e. not spend it often), I'd download TailsOS, boot into TailsOS (need to burn .iso to a DVD), open Electrum (a wallet program), generate a seed phrase (a bunch of random words), write the seed down &amp; keep it safe, then send your bitcoin to an address in that wallet.
If you do the above, your wallet will only exist as your seed phrase (list of words), which is considered very secure.
To gain access to your wallet, type the seed phrase into any instance of Electrum (i.e. running on android, IOS, windows, Linux, etc.). For security though, I'd recommend always using TailsOS.

Hard to have a single opinion about something so complex. On the plus side:
* Amazing community (the most important thing prior to mass-adoption)
* Brilliant leaders, no shortage of planet-sized brains here
* Ingenious design
* Dizzying array of potential use-cases
* Far better at the PR side of things than any competitor
On the negative side:
* Centralized control compared with Bitcoin (so more potential for control by nation states)
* Not immutable, which is show-stopping for many potential use-cases
* Technical problems that lead to DAO debacle seem to be intrinsic to the design, and certain to repeat.
Ultimately I'm happy to speculate short-term on their value, but I store none of my long-term wealth in Ethereum. Maybe I've lost out due to this, but Ethereum is far more likely than Bitcoin to encounter some devastating technical failure, if only because it tries to do so much more.

Generally with exchanges, there's a prominent 'withdraw' button. If you've got bitcoin stored on the site, look for this or something similar. Then all you need to do is specify the destination address (generated by your wallet, whether you opt for Electrum, another software wallet, a paper wallet, or a hardware wallet, it doesn't matter) and click send. The addresses are long alphanumeric strings beginning with a '1' or '3', and there's built-in typo resistance, so it's impossible to accidentally send to a wrong address by getting one letter/number wrong.

@_date: 2017-05-23 14:57:48
No, nodes don't mine (any more - in the early days they used to). Nodes form a network which relays info about what's happening to all users, and ensures that miners are following the rules. It's part of the way Bitcoin maintains security, and can be done on a very low power rig, even on a Raspberry Pi.
Right now there are about 7,000 nodes on the network.

Some miners - you could charitably describe their stances as somewhere on a spectrum from "fearful of losing fee income" through to "want to become the boss of Bitcoin" - are abusing their role to forestall technical upgrades to the code.

Hi, glad you're getting somewhere at least. I assume the negative balance means the transaction was sent twice ("double spent"). The transaction can't be cancelled- it will either be processed (in which case you'll have to liaise with the recipient to resolve), or will drop out of the mempool (I think this takes a fortnight now, not sure).
There are probably options if you wanted to speed up confirmation (e.g. you could spend the change from the unconfirmed transaction with a high fee- search 'child pays for parent'), but if this isn't of use you just have to wait.

Bitcoin is nascent tech in the very early days of its development. Already it has spooked the legacy industries into upping their game, but there's much more to come. In this transition period you may be able to point out situations wherein non-Bitcoin options are cheaper, but that will not last.
I first used Bitcoin to pay suppliers whom WU/Paypal/banks refused to deal with. The idea that intermediaries could attempt to mess with my business was so infuriating that I became sold on the idea that we must remove them. That conviction has only grown with time.

They are right for sure, but they seem (to my inferior brain, admittedly) only to consider the 'how' of Bitcoin. Very important of course. The only thing more important than the 'how' of Bitcoin is the 'why' of Bitcoin.
For me, the 'why' is encapsulated in that famous headline "Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks". The danger is we prioritise perfection in the 'how' at the expense of delivering on the 'why'.
The longer scaling solutions take, the less effective is Bitcoin's 'bum-rush' of the corrupt &amp; corrupting financial system, and the more time its incumbent foes have to perfect their defences.
Let's not sacrifice the 'why' of Bitcoin on the altar of its 'how'.

Current options are either:

You're confused. What's happening in August is **SegWit**.
Segwit2x is another thing entirely - an agreement drawn up by a few companies to fork away from Bitcoin, creating a new coin over which they have control.
Electrum (and all other wallets) will continue to function fine when segwit activates (in a month or so), though they may need updates to offer *additional* functionality enabled by segwit in the future. The only difference you'll notice will be cheaper fees/ faster confirmations, because there will be more than double the capacity.

You could generate a seed in electrum running in TailsOS, then write down both this seed and an address. Send your coins from the exchange to the address.

The perceived (by many core devs) rashness of BIP148 is really just a reaction to the perceived (by many users) complacency of core in addressing asicboost/scaling.
I have enormous respect for every person who's taken time to contribute to this undertaking, so I try to chose my words carefully &amp; accept I probably don't know better than any of the core devs. But that conversation seems abstracted from the real world situation, and elevates the pursuit of neutrality &amp; conservatism to unassailable positions.
It's about only being able to see the purity of the code/protocol, and excluding how the real world is playing out as we watch. If you pretend the threats posed by Jihan Wu, Bitmain, Roger Ver, (not to mention LTC/ETH/XMR/etc.) don't exist, the discussion is unimpeachable. Not surprising none of these actors is mentioned.
I get the impression that Bitcoin is seen purely as an academic exercise by most of the interlocutors. This attitude has taken Bitcoin very far, but it's surely worth considering whether a rigid adherence to this way of thinking now represents Bitcoin's biggest attack surface.

By verification I meant of your ID, etc. Generally the more you buy, the more proof of ID you need to provide.
For US-based small purchases I see most people talking about Coinbase. For the sums you're talking about, I wouldn't worry about raising suspicion. But equally, I wouldn't buy BTC then send it straight to a dark net market, as this is trivially discovered.
Better to use an exchange (or a service like shapeshift.io) to switch your BTC into a high-privacy currency like monero, and back into BTC, to sever the link between your initial purchase and Hansa Market. Some sites will even accept your deposit directly in (e.g.) monero, but I believe Hansa is currently BTC-only.

Cool, now you can open electrum from the applications menu &amp; it will ask you to either generate a new seed or enter an existing one.
Generate the seed, it will then open a wallet &amp; you can see addresses. All you have to do is keep the seed safe &amp; you can access this wallet on any instance of electrum (not just tails, but that's the super-paranoid-safe way).
2 USB sticks - I assume this means you're creating a persistent volume? I never do this, but I don't think there's any reason not to. I just get a weird kick out of knowing that my private keys are not stored on any machine anywhere.
I keep a list of addresses handy so that I don't need to fire up tails to send things to my wallet, and each time I use one, I cross it off the list (best practice is not to use any address more than once).

1MB blocks give us ~3 transactions per second. We need thousands. Increasing the block size doesn't get us thousands, but does imperil the system's security.
Segwit keeps all the security of small blocks, *and* gives us the route to achieving thousands of transactions per second. If you're not down with segwit, and you're not stupid, you're probably attacking Bitcoin.

No, that's not how it works.
There are fixed periods (336 blocks long), over which 269 blocks must signal BIP91. So in any one period, the first 67 blocks could signal nothing (i.e. 0%), and as long as the remaining 269 were all for BIP91, that would be enough to activate it.

The question implies that there's any basis for the current valuations of many of these alts.
But Bitcoin isn't perfect yet by any means. Until it can compete with something like Monero on privacy/fungibility, there will be demand for coins that offer such features (really just Monero at this time, Dash is a joke &amp; ZEC has other issues).

Your coins are safe in electrum, and there's nothing you need to do.
In the unlikely event of a persistent split, you'll own the same amount coins on both sides as you do now (because each chain will share a common history, on which your coins are recorded as belonging to you).
The only thing you need to remember is not to make any transactions from 1 August, until things become clearer.

Both sides share a common history, so you'll own the same amount you currently own, but on both.
The slightly tricky part is moving them on one chain without doing so on the other (e.g. if you want to sell off one side &amp; buy the other). I guess wallet devs might be working on ways to make this simple, should it be required.
I don't think a chain split of any real duration is likely.

The price rise is obviously related to reduced uncertainty over bitcoin's future, owing to BIP91/segwit activation. That our youtuber doesn't mention this stuff at all is telling.
This theory - that drug lords are moving their ill-gotten fiat *into* bitcoin, to put it beyond the reach of the law - is pretty stupid in all honesty. They'd have kept as much as possible in BTC to begin with, as explaining the existence of much fiat is very difficult.
But it also doesn't consider that, without Alpha Bay and Hansa Market, many fewer drug users will be buying their weekly BTC, which should mean downward pressure on the price.

The first two are attacks on the Bitcoin network, launched by incompetents and doomed to failure.
BIP148 was conceived to force miners into activating segwit (in the process of happening).
BIP91 was designed to give miners a route down from their ledge (they'd insisted they wouldn't activate segwit, and didn't want to look silly by just surrendering, so we came up with a way of letting them 'press the button' so that they could pretend they are the deciders).

At this point you'd be entitled to start asking how much of various legacy industries had been demolished by Bitcoin. The resources those industries no longer use (from mainframes to buildings to staff travelling to work each morning) must be deducted from Bitcoin's usage column to give a fair picture.
It's a hard thing to do, but every ball-park estimation I've tried leaves me under no illusion - Bitcoin is orders of magnitude better, in resource-utilization terms, than our present systems.
@_date: 2017-07-06 09:25:50
That's the way BIP148 works though. Miners who refuse to signal for segwit risk having their efforts rendered worthless. If they try to brazen it out they risk much more. It seems they're slowly accepting this inevitability.

I do understand these points, and see their merit. Being a core dev is incompatible with expediency, that's how it should be. Please understand though that principles can have costs, and this UASF (or the disruption it'll bring) is one of them.

The amount of verification isn't what matters in that case (i.e. if you're buying BTC from a bank account or a card, your identity is established for legal purposes).
You just need to either 'tumble' your coins (which is many people's choice, but imo provides only obfuscation), or switch your BTC into a privacy-focused alt (basically ZEC or monero) and back again.

This is nonsense. The best analysis we have shows that (for instance) segwit2x would threaten to kill 95% of current nodes within 6 months. So bigger blocks lead to centralisation, which in turn reduces Bitcoin's value to the vast majority of its users.
The only sane approach is to activate segwit asap, then study the impact of this in order to inform future scaling options.

Most people are expecting Aug 1st to be a non-event. It looks like miners are going to fall in line &amp; BIP148 will work.

BIP91 is only about segwit, nothing to do with segwit2x. It exists solely to get miners to signal segwit before BIP148 becomes active, i.e. to prevent a messy chainsplit/reorg situation.

Segwit is locked in by 95% of blocks signalling with bit 1.

We will not in the forseable future fork to '2MB' (really 8MB).


According to the best analysis available, it has the potential to kill 95% of nodes within 6 months of activation, destroying decentralisation &amp; putting Bitcoin in the hands of a few giant corporations.
One day, once the impact of segwit has been carefully studied, and if it's deemed safe &amp; necessary, we might need to increase the size dedicated to tx data. That day is a long time away.

There's no reason to think this right now.
*If* there's a fork, *and* one chain has much more hash power than the other, *and* miners from the more-hash-power-chain decide to attack the other side, then *maybe* mining on the lesser chain will require new hardware.

You're missing time and reading. We all started out with these questions.
E.g. the electricity point seems unassailable. Then you begin to think of all the infrastructure that powers current money systems. You imagine 10 million bank employees pootling into work each morning, skyscrapers lighting up etc., and the power required for mining no longer seems significant. Or you imagine that you can't pay off debts to government with it, but then remember that currency exchange is a thing.
But you're a bit pre-occupied with the 'how', which is to put the cart before the horse. The way it all clicked for me began with appreciating *why* it was created. When I realised what quantitative easing &amp; bank bailouts implied about the world we live in.

Segwit will work automatically, and I think all major wallets are ready for it.

@_date: 2017-07-11 13:32:07
The pro is that segwit gets activated.
The cons are that the planned hard fork proposes a dangerous change, implemented in a dangerous way, for no good reason. Also, it's clear the devs don't understand what they're doing, and have left themselves a few percent of the *minimum* time required to ensure this dangerous change, implemented in a dangerous way, actually functions as they intend.
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:14:08
I don't know who told you this, but stop listening to them. Segwit2x would be an altcoin, but it's hypothetical as it pretty obviously doesn't have devs capable of making it run.
Once segwit activates on Bitcoin, we'll begin assessing its impact &amp; see what's required from there. We *might* consider raising the block size at some point in the future, if it's safe and necessary. Careful analysis is required first.

August 1st is when BIP148 begins. BIP148 says 'signal segwit or your blocks are invalid'.
BIP91 was a face-saving measure intended to get miners (who had loudly proclaimed their refusal to signal segwit) signalling segwit, so that they are obeying BIP148.
Segwit2x is the name given to an agreement between some companies. It aims to create a new coin, forked away from from Bitcoin. If it happens (very unlikely, as nobody really wants a new coin) it is scheduled to fork away in November.
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:13:36
BIP148's UASF is the sole reason BIP91 was invented, and consequently, is the reason segwit looks like it'll activate soon. BIP148 was designed to provoke exactly this kind of response, and has been an unqualified success.
Your confusion stems from thinking we're activating segwit2x right now, but we're not.

Segwit is simply an upgrade to bitcoin. There will not be 2 coins any time soon, just Bitcoin with new segwit-related abilities.

Then absolutely everything about Bitcoin that isn't just exactly how any individual wants it to be is an attack to him/her, and justifies the most extreme counter-measures.
I'm not against a PoW change ever, but I'd like to exhaust a few more options, maybe let the attackers make some more mistakes. If for example a majority of miners pushed an 8MB block HF (and were messing with the original chain), that would be a time to change PoW. But in response to BIP148 failing to gain enough hash power? You'd just be creating another alt.
fwiw, I think BIP148 is having the desired effect and this is hypothetical.

But in any case, there's a very good chance the UASF will lead to segwit activating on Bitcoin. The same Bitcoin they develop, and which is supposedly the subject of future attack. Can you really not see why they might want to think about it (as if they haven't already).

It means the BIP148 UASF is having the desired effect, and we're more likely than ever to get segwit soon.

This article is totally inaccurate.
BIP91 is nothing to do with segwit2x. It's about activating segwit. The 2x hard fork will not happen and has *no link at all* to BIP91.

Segwit2x (i.e. 8MB max block size), by the best available analysis, threatens to kill 95% of nodes within 6 months.
If it's *just* tps you're into, might I suggest Visa?
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:21:25
We need 269 blocks in any of a series of 336-block groups to signal BIP91. With 194 of the current 336-block group yet to be mined, we're just under the required percentage.
While I totally expect some fuckery from certain miners, we've plenty of time yet - in fact we're a little ahead of schedule, as the software many miners aim to be running for the activation is not yet released.
The point about 1 August is that BIP148 nodes will begin rejecting non-BIP141 blocks. Since there are a number of risks to this happening, miners are expected to get their sorry shit together before this date.
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:40:35
Lol, you don't really believe more than 80% of miners are going to abandon Bitcoin for an alt do you?
It may get a substantial minority at first, but without users' backing the coin's value will plummet, and miners will return to Bitcoin or go bankrupt.
@_date: 2017-05-17 23:43:59
I'd happily go for a segwit/block size reduction option ;-)

If two different miners produce blocks of equal height simultaneously, how does the network deal with that?

I'm sure it's been done already, but your post needs a little BIP148 guy holding segwit, saying to a miner "I made this"... You know the rest.
@_date: 2017-07-19 11:41:12
The chance of a fork in August is now close to zero. If you sell your BTC now, the likelihood is you'll have to buy it back at a loss.

For long term storage, consider either making a wallet in TailsOS (which includes a great wallet called Electrum), or buy a hardware wallet (Trezor, Ledger, etc.).


Without wishing to disparage Paymium, the history of Bitcoin is thick with instances of such exchanges being hacked. It's therefore regarded as a cardinal sin to store bitcoin in a way that means you're not the custodian of your private keys.

Not all signalling is the same. Here's a site which tracks segwit signalling properly -

The community is supporting Bitcoin. BIP91 has locked in (and it looks like BIP148 will be merged into the Core client shortly), BIP141 (segwit) will be next to activate, and by the end of August we'll have Bitcoin as it exists now, only with segwit activated.

The thing is, Wright is very clearly a fraud. If you still think it's worth looking into him, it should be about figuring out who is using him to further their aims.

Contact the exchange, show them the transaction on the blockchain, and they should return your BTC (minus tx fee).

tl;dr - 
Miners can make stupid mistakes when they try to cut corners. Segwit allows them to go further into mistake-making territory, but full nodes will still catch these mistakes &amp; reject the resultant invalid blocks.
So 'dangerous', but in the sense of 'absolutely nothing changes'.

BIP91 is Segwit *alone*. BIP148 is also just focused on segwit alone. BIP91 is just a method someone came up with to ensure miners were complying with BIP148. Both apply to Bitcoin.
Coinbase will stick with Bitcoin for sure. Whether they also let people buy the segwit2x fork's new coin is up to them, but they currently sell Bitcoin, Litecoin &amp; Ethereum, so there's no reason they won't if it becomes established.

The first tx ( took a few hours to confirm.
The second tx (the one you mention) has a fairly low fee. While it will confirm at some point, you're best paying a little more if it's urgent.
(I've no experience with TX accelerator, so can't shed any light there)
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:55:06
The first one is a standard .exe file which when downloaded has everything required, and installs when double clicked.
The second is like downloading a little program which when double clicked downloads &amp; installs the main programme.
The last is designed so that you can run it from a usb stick or similar, so that it works on whatever device it's plugged into.
None of them are ideal for cold storage though, I'd instead download tailsOS, boot into that, and use the electrum bundled with tails to create your wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:33:13
I'm sure you're done the right thing. Coinbase probably just processes withdrawals in batches or similar.
@_date: 2017-07-13 23:35:13
Just to add to u/Mathematician22's great answer, if you import your private key into an HD wallet such as Electrum, the private keys cannot be restored from the wallet's seed.
For this reason, if you ever have to import keys into an HD wallet, it's always best to make a new HD wallet &amp; send your coins there.
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:39:44

I'd call the private key &amp; public key together a 'keypair', but I don't think there's a term for the combination of private key &amp; corresponding address.
The vast majority of wallets manage many keys on the users behalf. Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets even have a master keypair from which child-keypairs are derived. These are useful for many reasons, e.g. you can have a master public key *only* in a wallet on e.g. your phone, and use that to monitor your cold storage addresses without risking any funds.

The only thing to be aware of is, if a permanent split *does* occur, and you're trying to make a transaction, you might need to select in your wallet software which chain's coins you're trying to move. But that's not worth thinking about right now.
@_date: 2017-07-20 11:00:42
Not sure what you're asking.
BIP91 aims to obviate BIP148 UASF by making sure all miners are adhering to its terms. So if BIP91 happens according to schedule, miners will be in accord with the requirements of the UASF and segwit/BIP141 will be activated.
The whole point of the UASF was to produce this sort of response.
@_date: 2017-05-23 09:46:29

The relevant section is below. As you can see, there's only one definition given of a satoshi:

But they also state that a "Single bitcoin can be broken to 1,000,000 bits." The mistake you're making is to understand "bits" as 'pieces', whereas the author is referring to the practice of calling a microbitcoin a 'bit', as shown [here](

A transaction being included in a block is described as 'confirmed'. As more blocks are made on top of that block, we can be more and more certain that the transaction is irreversible.
There are new rules in play that mean some blocks may get orphaned (rejected from the blockchain). Any transactions included in orphaned blocks appear 'confirmed', but then go back to being unconfirmed. 
Bittrex is saying that because of the new rules, they're going to wait until five blocks have been built on top of the one containing your transaction before treating it as certain.

Aside from the obvious storing bitcoin online, with others holding your keys?
Security has to take up more head-space. Windows isn't your friend &amp; options like TailsOS exist. My 2FA device is dedicated solely to that purpose (but I also have 'fake' empty accounts with a few exchanges that are linked to my every-day phone. Took 5 mins to set up and provides some plausible deniability). Use dedicated, application-specific email services, be meticulous with regard to logging in &amp; out. Etc. etc.

Nobody in my boat believes this.
Truth is anyone can move the price of bitcoin if they're willing to burn through money. And Bitmain are very rich. But the idea - BCC - is so poor that it will be a temporary movement only.
So the question becomes "should I try to time the market to take advantage of any disruption?"

I have an aversion to Bitpay (they're owned by the same miners who've been holding bitcoin upgrades hostage all this time), so I'm not an expert, but:
I believe Bitpay's 12-word seeds are BIP39 compatible. This means that you can use these words in any BIP39 compatible wallet and you'll have full access to your coins. So as long as you keep the 12 words safe, you can be sure of accessing your funds again far in the future.
The best thing to do (if not going with TailsOS) is:
1) generate a new wallet, note down your seed words and an address.
2) try to use these seed words in another wallet that's BIP39 compatible (e.g. Samourai Wallet)
3) if the address you noted in step 1 appears in this new wallet, you can be sure that your seed phrase is working and compatible with industry standards.
4) send your coins to an address in that wallet &amp; try not to look at the price daily...
5) delete all trace of the wallets from your device
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:06:40
You assign the coins to addresses that you control by virtue of a secret "private key", known only to you. This key can be used to send the coins elsewhere, e.g. to pay for things.
You can store as much as you like on a wallet, I guess the warning is about having all your eggs in one basket (so if you lost one wallet's private keys, you still have some BTC).
Never store your bitcoin on a website, the short history of cryptocurrency is peppered with instances such as you describe. Get a wallet (hardware wallets are recommended for significant sums).

You've confused segwit (which looks like it will activate mid-to-late August), with segwit2x.
If segwit2x ever exists, it will be as an altcoin. I.e., it will fork away from Bitcoin and begin a new life as a technically laughable new currency, whose value would be derived solely from its capacity to find new ways to trip itself up.
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:53:33

I like Electrum, and for long term storage recommend generating your seed within TailsOS (which bundles Electrum). This goes a long way to making sure that some malware on your PC doesn't steal your keys. A gentle learning curve in exchange for peace of mind.
The seed you generate can be used in any instance of electrum (windows, android, etc.), but it's best never to type a long-term storage seed anywhere that could be compromised (until it's time to spend it!).

You're mixing up segwit (a technical improvement to the way Bitcoin works) and segwit2x (an agreement to implement segwit followed by a hardfork some months later).
Wait until segwit gets locked in (this will be loudly proclaimed on every Bitcoin-related news/discussion site), then buy.
If, further down the line, there's *any* danger of the hard-fork associated with segwit2x happening, it will potentially signal the end of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:57:12
If/when a fork happens, the chains that result will share a common history (i.e. all the blocks mined up until the fork). Any bitcoin you own on the original chain will be duplicated on the fork.
The question then is "I now have coins on two chains - which if any will retain value?". While there's no way to answer this definitively ahead of time, I will personally only value the coins which have the support of the current core devs (i.e. that which underpins BTC's value pre-split will continue to do so post-split).
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:06:01
Totally possible, but in my view unlikely.
I guess the biggest threat is from a coin with improved privacy/fungibility, but this only seems realistic in the context of a global crack-down on cryptocurrencies (and then only if the authorities are reliant on methods which exploit coins' traceability, which also seems unlikely).
Only monero, of currently available cryptocurrencies, would seem to meet the requirements to even be a realistic competitor, but I think it faces substantial scaling problems of its own.
For something new to come along and unseat Bitcoin, it would have to be better in a way that Bitcoin couldn't copy, introduce no new deficiencies, and overcome a gigantic network effect.

You can't buy BTC with a paper wallet. Sign up to an exchange or similar, buy the BTC, then send them to an address for which you control the private keys. This could be a paper wallet, or something like an HD wallet (e.g. Electrum) where you only need to store a seed phrase.
You need to be sure your PC/Phone/whatever is secure when you generate your wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:02:07
Ask yourself why bitcoin is valuable in the first place-
Is it because large corporations own lots of ASIC miners, or because it's an unbreakable, unstoppable, sovereign money system?
If you answer the former, you'll think the Jihan chain is more likely to retain most value. If the latter, you'll likely opt for the side with the core devs' support.
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:05:06
A large majority of people in Bitcoin are against the 2x part. This means that if miners are stupid enough to try it, the value of their new 2x coin will plummet relatively to Bitcoin, and most/all miners will return, chastened, to mine Bitcoin (they can't afford not to).
If you doubt my assessment, consider this- why, with ~80% of miners in favour of it, have big blockers been unable to increase the block size thus far? It's because miners are the employees of bitcoin users, and employees who simply ignore the wishes of their employers get fired.

[According to the people behind it]( BCC will only exist if BIP148 results in a fork.
BIP148 will only result in a fork if miners refuse to signal segwit. Right now, 100% of miners are signalling segwit, so BCC seems highly unlikely to become a reality.
But even if BCC *did* become a thing, it's being coded by people with a track-record of bumbling ineptitude (compared to Bitcoin's core devs). Its value would likely plummet to just-above-zero in a very short time frame.
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:40:20

Basically, the wallet is assuming there's only one chain. If there are two chains, and no changes are made to software (nodes, miners, wallets, etc.), it will be very hard to spend on one chain and not on the other, as neither chain has any way of knowing which chain's coins you're trying to spend. 
Even if you manage to have your transaction relayed on chain A alone, anyone can re-broadcast your transaction on chain B (this is often referred to in the bitcoin space as a "replay attack"). 
There are methods available to combat this problem, but they'll require some changes to software somewhere along the line (not necessarily in electrum, but *somewhere*).
It's very unlikely imho that any chain-split will persist beyond a day or two (worst case), and your best bet is to wait it out.
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:13:00
Yes, if a split happens you'll own coins on each chain. Beware of trying to move one side, as you can inadvertently move the duplicates too (or someone can 'replay' the transaction on the other chain). Hopefully some software will be released to help with this.

Two factor authentication is an additional layer of security, but I don't use it as I'm comfortable with my current level of protection. The down side is that it charges a small fee each time, but losing your phone isn't a worry as you will still be able to restore the wallet from your seed phrase.
Tails should connect. I'm assuming your connection is otherwise fine (i.e. you can reach the internet using the browser in tails), and that you are using the latest version of Tails.  Can you try pointing electrum to a different server?
I've never typed my seed anywhere other than tails for the reasons you give. If you've done this, you should generate a new wallet/seed before sending your coins.

BIP91 has *nothing* to do with segwit2x. It's just a way to activate segwit (BIP141), as is the UASF (BIP148). They do the same thing in a slightly different way. 
Both *could* lead to chain splits, but neither is likely to.
The UAHF is designed to produce a fork (i.e. a whole new coin), and will do so.

Any more than 20% and mining companies - especially those pools representing hundreds of small players - will be getting very twitchy indeed.

They are just setting a bit in the block's header, no requirement to actually run anything specific prior to activation.


No, anyone is free to run whatever mining code they like. A 2MB hard fork is planned, but I'd be astonished if it actually happens. It's all just posturing to hide the fact that BIP148 reaffirms that miners have to do what users want.

Soft forks are always preferable to hard forks. But if you *have* to hard fork, you should really include things like spoonnet3, schnorr sigs, etc. Crazy to HF then only change max block size.
Segwit2x allows blocks up to 8MB to be mined. The best analysis we have shows that this has the potential to break 95% of nodes within 6 months. It's idiotic, even if it was capable of being implemented safely.
Only sane plan is to implement segwit then study effects. Perhaps tentatively plan for an HF, on an appropriate timescale, which includes improvements other than a block size bump (which *may* be required at some point, but isn't yet).

Bitcoin's volatility is a result of being a tiny-but-prominent little dinghy in a sea of supertankers. But volatility is reducing steadily as a long-term trend, because bitcoin is growing. By the time we're ready for the big time, Bitcoin will be rock-solid compared to fiat.

Read like crazy. Ideally, you shouldn't buy heavily into *anything* until you have an accurate working model of its operation, but buy $10 worth to see how sending/receiving/storing it works.
So then learn about how money currently works. Then concepts such as public key cryptography, hashing, Merkle trees, the Byzantine Generals' problem, open source, etc.
Then hold it all together in your head, considering it from all angles &amp; via multiple analogies, until you can see how the various parts of bitcoin work in synchrony to produce a probabilistic solution to the problem of fault-tolerant consensus.
It took me a while, honestly. I instinctively rejected the idea of bitcoin to begin with, but a love of codes/ciphers/locks/etc sort of drove me to understand it - expecting to find the flaw that undermined the claims its system made. I'm so glad I persisted.

That's up to you, and how likely your what-if scenarios are in your world.


You're slowly getting there. Hardware wallets could, I guess, be called machines. But to compare them to phones/PCs is way-off. They are incomparably more secure.
I don't have a dog in this fight, as I don't own a hardware wallet. But I probably should, because they're really good for security.
@_date: 2017-07-06 12:48:52
How well you manage your phrase is most important, but you're missing what the hardware wallets do:
Hardware wallets provide the ability to side-step insecure operating systems. You'd normally type your seed phrase/password into a laptop or phone, potentially exposing these details. Hardware wallets instead keep the private keys off-machine.
So you have wallet software on your PC/Phone, but that software only prepares the transaction, it cannot send anything. You then plug in your hardware wallet &amp; sign the transaction, following which the payment is broadcast by the wallet.
As the hardware wallet is far, far more secure than your PC or phone, so is your bitcoin.

It's the likelihood of BIP91 locking in that you'd calculate, not segwit.
You'd think there's a link, but it's mostly fake signalling right now so we'll have to wait &amp; see how miners handle the requirement to reject certain blocks.

Agree with your points, but my choice of the word "suitable" above was deliberate. We're in the business of giving miners a face-saving way out - can't really expect them to run a client whose *name* mocks their goals.

BitPay is regarded as a 'bad actor', having been bought by the people who are currently trying to kill Bitcoin. It's definitely worth your while to send your stash to a new wallet.
Electrum is great, but so are many others. Just make sure whatever you chose is not a website-based wallet, and is committed to supporting (as a minimum) the chain that cannot reorganise post-July.
Not sure about the "Bitcoin Core BIP148 laptop" thing, nor the part about keeping nodes switched off. Sounds like you've gotten your wires crossed somewhere. Simply avoid any transactions after 31 July, until it becomes clear that no chain split will occur (I expect this to take a day or so at the very most, and in all likelihood will be settled prior to the end of July - in other words a non-event).

This is a misunderstanding of how bitcoin works. You run a node to validate your own transactions, that's all.
There are altcoins with the properties you desire (i.e. exchanging censor-resistance for low on-chain fees), but the market appears to have rejected them for now.

Some confusion to unpick here.
It's true that Segwit+lightning will allow many tx to appear as two tx on the blockchain. But that's nothing to do with decentralisation.
The barrier to running a node has to be kept low so that as many people as possible can run one. If nodes only worked in datacentre-style scenarios, governments could shut down Bitcoin with a few threatening letters. But if nodes work wherever an internet connection is to be found, governments would have to close the internet.
It's easier to write a few letters than shut down the internet.

After BIP91 is locked in (and after another 336 block period has passed), blocks not signalling BIP141 (segwit) will be orphaned. This has nothing to do with "BTC1", which as far as I understand it doesn't really exist in any useful way.
After a 2-week/2016 block period of BIP141 blocks (during which BIP148's UASF would otherwise have maybe caused chainsplits &amp; re-orgs), segwit will be locked in.
Segwit is already part of core &amp; other implementations, so they will continue to work perfectly throughout this period.

It's what I'd recommend. Better security, cheaper txs. What's not to like?


Yes to tor (though it might require javascript to be allowed), no need to wait.


You only get 10 minutes to send the initial tx with shapeshift, so unless your exchange sends withdrawals instantly, maybe best to send purchase to a wallet you own.


No, for simplicity mymonero.com is your best bet (a web wallet, but it's not like you're storing funds there for long)


Ah, I get you. Monero just has better privacy than tumbling can provide, and I'd have thought would be cheaper as there's only 1 more BTC tx fee to pay than for a normal/direct tx.

It is ordinarily, but right now it's not possible to safely use Electrum on TailsOS as far as I know. Tails is based on Debian, the Electrum maintainer for which has seemingly stepped down.
Since there was recently an attack on electrum that necessitated upgrades to a new version, no electrum wallet can work safely with TailsOS. Until a new maintainer ports the relevant upgrades.
Bitcoin previously stored on Electrum/TailsOS are safe (and can be accessed via any working version of Electrum), but it's not what I'd recommend for someone setting up a wallet right now.
Buy a coldcard/trezor imho.

The point is you can only safely softfork if a large majority of the hashpower follows the fork. But then you get the benefit that old clients still function properly.
If there's a risk that the softfork will not have the backing of such a majority of hashpower, the risk of reorg means you need instead to hardfork (and will consequently lose the old clients, with all the attendant hassle that causes).

Since you've ruled out the obvious &amp; most useful answer...
No. You have to understand how difficult mining bitcoin has become. Even if there was software for the task, your phone probably couldn't generate the equivalent of $0.01 in a year.
Since mining pools have a minimum payout (to reduce admin &amp; fee issues), you would see no BTC if you left the phone running for multiple human lifetimes.

I think we're already a little risky at 3999280 bytes.
There isn't great/recent data on the risk to nodes, but a 2016 study by bitmex (iirc) claimed that 4MB blocks would break 95% of nodes. Obviously infrastructure has improved since then, and a chain with many such large blocks is only really plausible right now under an attack scenario, but I'd want to see much better info than I have to date before I'd suggest any increase.

They're trying to market them as worth ~0.2 BTC each initially. I suspect the best price anyone will get in the real world is 0.02 BTC, and I wouldn't be surprised if they drop away to 0.0002 BTC in the first few days.
That said, Bitmain have a *lot* of money to burn, and may well feel the incentive is there to prop up the new coin in early trading. I just have a problem believing they're stupid enough to burn very much of their stash before pulling the plug.

Dash was significantly pre-mined, and according to my best assessment (and that of people whose opinions I value - G Maxwell for one), has a fundamentally broken privacy model. It simply doesn't work, and shouldn't be mentioned alongside ZEC &amp; XMR.
ZEC is much more interesting, but has a number of issues which prevent me from holding any. Firstly and most seriously, it's a product owned by a company - There's a CEO who regularly talks about [changing the fundamentals]( or [repossessing any ZEC that hasn't moved in a while]( to re-distribute - pretty scary. Secondly, the initial trusted setup scenario is just something that puts me off, it 'smells wrong' (I think it probably wasn't compromised, but there's *no way* to know). Thirdly, I hate that the privacy is an optional mode - that's a terrible design decision. Lastly, the mathematics is too new to trust, and though it hurts my pride a little to say it, I personally just don't understand it enough.

Business man refuses to accept miners' position in the Bitcoin system. After all, he's got many millions invested in infrastructure, what do users/devs have? In all other industries, the one with the factories is in charge. So he wants to be the boss of Bitcoin.
On the other side, many users are seduced by the prospect of 'being their own bank', but are ill-equipped to engage in the active decision making required of such a paradigm. The lure of a boss is therefore obvious, and they are in any case habituated to such a situation.

I get new coins by buying things with bitcoin &amp; keeping the change.
So each paycheck I identify something I need (this month a hat and a keyboard) that is available in exchange for bitcoin. Then I buy more bitcoin than I need, and send the excess to an offline wallet address.
This way I support the uptake of bitcoin among retailers, get my shopping done, and add to my stash. It probably costs me ~BTC 0.01 each month to do this, but that's cheaper than running a node &amp; maybe more helpful for Bitcoin's future success.

Samourai is pretty much the best mobile wallet I've tried (and I try to use them all).

My advice is to give it a go, but not to trust your liberty to the privacy claims it makes.
Sentinel is just a 'watching wallet' - you can't spend from it, but you can receive &amp; keep track of your btc. I've not used it but it's likely to be good, since the task of creating such a wallet is simpler in some ways.

Electrum, Green Address, and Samourai are my favourite android wallets. Any of those will work, but they're only as secure as the underlying OS. Which is to say, not very secure.
I only keep small amounts for random spending on my phone, which receives fast security updates. My main threat in this situation is probably from muggers, so my wallet requires a different unlock code from the phone. My assumption is that an attacker will demand the phone unlock code then run away, whereupon I will use the wallet's seed to access &amp; move my funds from another device.

They are solutions to different problems.
Multisig protects your coins by putting your eggs in more than one basket. Hardware wallets protect your coins by shielding your keys from insecure, general-purpose computing environments when you transact (and transact you must, at some point).
Whether one or the other is 'better' depends on the specifics of the threats you face - what's best for you may be sub-optimal for another.
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:00:50
Others have tried to give names to certain denominations, but none have stuck (except satoshis). Partly because this is the sort of thing that usually arises from everyday usage, and partly because bitcoin's price has grown such that no one fraction has had much time to be in common usage.
I personally favour SI-style prefixes - e.g. either kilosats or millibitcoins, but it just can't be forced. Some people even strongly dislike 'satoshis', but that battle seems lost.

It's a scam imho. You might make money on it in the short term, but 99% of these token sales are doomed, and this has all the appearance of being more doomed than most.
I was being a little sarcastic above, for which I apologise. The questions you should be asking, when asked to pay $36 million, are: "is $36 million worth of work going into this project?"; "does this token provide a solution to a real-world problem worth $36 million?"; "are there more promising ideas in the world of crypto-currencies that I'm missing out on by investing in this one?".

There are businesses who'll handle it all for you, and e.g. keep it all in a wallet for you, or change it instantly to fiat, or a blend of both.
I have a small side-business for which I tried to accept bitcoin, and it really didn't go anywhere. This was partly because it was 2014, and partly because my clientele doesn't overlap very much with the bitcoin community as then (or currently) constituted.
I do, however, find it invaluable for paying suppliers on occasion. Many of our products come from countries with unstable governance, and it isn't unusual to face either sky-high remittance fees or even a total refusal (on behalf of banks, WU, etc.) to facilitate payment. It used to be quite hard to persuade people to accept btc, but it gets easier all the time.

People will spend less for sure, but they must still buy things to live, so an economy much like the current one will persist. If people are to be persuaded to part with their bitcoin, it will be by manufacturers offering them something that's *worth it*. I.e., unlike out current endlessly inflationary system, bitcoin holders will not feel a need to quickly get rid of their cash on trash &amp; in-built obsolescence. So I think goods will become fewer &amp; higher quality.
Just as bitcoin is key to the spread of renewable power, so it will also mean the end of a capitalist model optimised for resource consumption, and the beginning of something much more future-focused &amp; environmentally sound.

The rise from $0.65 to $2.60 is because the block space is in greater demand, not because BTC went up against the USD.

Anyone can upgrade bitcoin's protocol at any time they like, there's no formal process. The problem is, unless other people agree to run your changes, you have forked yourself off the network.
Equally, if everyone else decides to implement a change and you refuse, you'll be stuck on a 'legacy' chain.

It wasn't really a bet, more a promise from Ver to donate to charity if the tx confirmed. There was no reciprocal obligation on Vays.
Ver did say 'today', but it was in the context of him asserting that a 5 cent fee would take *multiple* days (or weeks!) to confirm, and Vays calling him out. I think 24h was implied by that context, but I accept it's certainly arguable.
Either way, Vays was clearly correct to point out Roger's lie about 'days or weeks'- I had similar transactions confirm in the same period, because the mempool was empty.

Not used either in a while. As far as I know, breadwallet still doesn't allow users to set their own fees, and mycelium is going though some corporate/internal hassle (they recently changed their dev team &amp; management, then started showing adverts in their wallet - when users asked them to stop, they got a little pissy, demanding to know how they were expected to make money. So I've avoided since then, though the ads are now gone - who knows how they'll try to monetise users next, they sure have a lot of data to sell...).
However, I'm sure coins stored in either will be fine in the unlikely event of a fork.

Bitcoin will hit new highs, fees will go crazy, the bubble will pop, and bitcoin will hit higher lows. Maybe even as low as $35k.
Your dislike of LN is silly of course, but equally LN will likely not be ready for general-purpose use during the next bull-run. It will likely spur as many on-chain transactions as it prevents in these early days.
Sometimes you just have to accept that you can't always get what you want, especially if that would mean sacrificing core properties such as immutability.

BIP148 was designed to make miners do something like BIP91, basically saying "do as we require and it'll be smooth, force us to make the decision for you and it'll be less so". It seems to have worked as intended.
BIP 148 does nothing to generate a split, only miners working against users' interests can do that.
Both simply lead to the activation of BIP141, the only difference is BIP91 allows miners to get away with claiming they did it because they wanted to.
(I should add that there are many friendly miners, but sadly the problematic ones are a substantial proportion of the whole)

@_date: 2016-07-15 18:38:25
While from a personal wealth point of view I'd love a bitcoin-only future, it does scream 'single point of failure'.
On that basis, I guess a future where half a dozen digital currencies compete would be more robust, and might ensure the continued technological advancement of all.
On top of that, it seems plausible that some coins (e.g. etherium) will specialise on non-remittance usage, and will do that one thing better than the competition (e.g. bitcoin) with other 'main purposes'.
For me, fiat has become the shitcoin. Governments - the ultimate regulators - have been captured. Not even the scammiest alt is as bad in my eyes.
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:25:44


Basically, the bigger the block size, the more centralised the system. The more centralised the system, the easier to shut down. The easier to shut down, the less value bitcoin has.
Most feel that 2MB blocks are "safe" in this regard (with small bug fixes), but less desirable than an alternate scaling mechanism (segwit), which both roughly doubles capacity, and enables scaling *far beyond* that offered by a simple block size increase.
@_date: 2019-05-31 12:39:53

I am not against bigger blocks if analysis shows they are safe &amp; needed, but I think/hope we activate segwit in the next couple of months, then see how it affects the operation of the bitcoin network in all its complexity before committing to anything else.

I don't think Ripple even qualifies as a cryptocurrency. It's just a bunch of smoke &amp; mirrors PR designed to beguile institutions, making them think they can have all the Bitcoin cool stuff while retaining all the control.
My feeling about ETH is more to do with the fundamental model - It's clearly amazing tech and the devs/community also kick ass. But (and maybe this is my failing) I can't understand how it's better working as one big system, rather than multiple &amp; specialised instances of Ethereum. And I don't get why the tokens are worth more than the real value the system supports. Unlike Bitcoin, it is a terrible currency/store of value, so the worth should only come from the cool stuff happening in contracts/DAOs/etc.

Money - the system - is too fundamental a part of society to be allowed to remain in the hands of those who'd mismanage it, whether through malice or incompetence.

Large fee probably caused by many small inputs. Using the same seed elsewhere is not going to change that. Options include:
* Wait until current fee levels subside
* Import the relevant private keys directly into your cold storage wallet (make sure you save the wallet.dat if so)
* Delete your mycelium wallet (remembering the seed) and treat this as off-line storage

It's all smoke and mirrors at the moment, but two facts remain true:
1) Some people with lots of money are trying to subvert the technological advancement of Bitcoin.
2) Anyone who matters will stick with the version of the protocol as implemented by the core devs.
There will be fuss, muss, and bother in the short term, but Bitcoin is so much more resilient than these attackers imagine.

Some wallets use seed phrases which are compatible across multiple other wallets under the BIP39 specification. Others (notably Electrum) don't, but do share the same format/word list.
Basically though you shouldn't worry, it's very likely that all the major wallets today use seed/wallet.dat formats that will be simple to access in the future.

After segwit is activated, the plan is to study how the economy of Bitcoin is affected, and make new scaling plans in light of that information.
There are good reasons to keep the size of blocks (and growth of the blockchain in general) as small as possible without restricting the growth of the system, but bigger blocks are entirely possible should data indicate their necessity.

I don't think that is an inherent property of this new territory, but rather a function of its youth and the corresponding absence of a critical mass of experts.
We're in the early days of acquiring a sort of immune system within the userbase. The longer bitcoin lasts, the greater the memory of previous frauds/failures/attacks we collectively posses, and the harder it becomes for new scams to find a foothold. In this way, I think bcash was a perfect sort of cowpox situation, which has inoculated us against a devastating future (and e.g. Google-branded) smallpox epidemic.

Good work all round OP. I would add (for anyone reading) that if you stored your bitcoins in a desktop wallet like Exodus, adding a Trezor like this needs to be done correctly.
Essentially, you need to move your bitcoin into a new wallet, whose keys were generated inside the Trezor. You can then hook this new wallet up to software of your choice.
Always ask yourself "Where have my keys been". If the answer is 'Windows' (or any general-purpose OS), those are dirty, dirty keys, unsafe for more than chump change.

@_date: 2017-06-14 02:19:45
Every one of the ~32% miners (by hashrate) currently signalling segwit has a huge incentive to respond to BIP148. If a little more than half of *them* understand this, it's a done deal.
I don't think there's any doubt which chain the users favour, so prices would quickly rise, comparatively, on the BIP148 chain. Then it would be clear to Jihan-chain miners that the game was up, and they'd direct their rigs to the correct chain.
Users seem to be about 75% in favour of BIP148, so the chances of support by &gt;17% of miners isn't really equivalent to your snowball.

No, not a 51% attack.
Imagine you have an old-rules node after a soft fork happens - if a large minority of miners also stick with the old rules, transactions can be included in blocks, get multiple confirmations, then effectively disappear. Why? Because your node will follow the longest chain, which will in the long-run be the one with the new rules (still valid to your node of course).
So I could pay you, you'd think the payment was fine, I'd get my goods or whatever, then the chain would reorg and you'd not have received my payment.
If however a sufficiently large proportion of the hashpower commits to the new rules, multiple confirmations become vanishingly unlikely, so you can stick with your old node without worrying.

If you're talking about $2,800 worth of Bitcoin, a fee of a couple of dollars seems inconsequential.

Are you asking if your security is good? Because there's no way to answer that. Where you say:


I'd want to know what you mean. Private keys/seeds should be kept away from the internet *as much as possible*. Trezors/etc. do this very well. Paper wallets/TailsOS/etc. also good, but harder to do right. The further you stray from this practice, the riskier you get.

@_date: 2018-12-03 19:01:41
The whole idea relies on: 1) there being some miners who burn through a precious resource to provide security for a coin, and who are 2) paid for doing this work in the very coin they secure, while 3) some other people, who also use the coin, watch to make sure the miners are following the rules.
If you can understand that, you then should look at how each aspect works, then put them all together.

Not quite.
Coinbase will deliberately share your info widely, no accidental crashes there - it will happen &amp; on purpose. At some point, someone in the large group of people with access to your info will sell it (along with thousands of others's info) when they shouldn't, but I'd argue the genie was out of the bottle before that point - 'should' and 'shouldn't' being pretty meaningless terms from your point of view.

This just isn't true. Segwit is so obviously better as a scaling solution than a simple blocksize increase, that it's just not a serious position to prefer the latter. I'm not going to engage beyond this statement, but I encourage you to rethink your assessment.

If you're confused, you're not the only one.
For me, a blockchain *has* to move around a token which is both native to that blockchain &amp; is valuable. Smart contracts can be built on top of that blockchain (e.g. in a second layer), but to my mind cannot work without the valuable tokens part.
This is what confuses me about Ethereum, because it's really not geared up to do the valuable tokens bit. I realise each Ether is ~$260 right now, which might make my point sound silly, but this value seems to me all predicated on future potential- a potential I don't think works without a currency system underpinning it. And I don't see how Ethereum can work as a proper currency (scaling issues far worse than BTC, not immutable, complex contracts able to grind system to a halt, etc).
That said, I own some, so it's not like I am against it. Just confused by the overall economic model.
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:28:48
I'm still not with you. I am aware that bitcoin has increased in value against USD, but that's a separate issue. Fees have risen because block space is in greater demand.
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:01:29
It is, and is part of the reason why so many are sceptical of Ethereum - it's not immutable, doesn't scale, plus their 'Satoshi' (Vitalik Buterin) is still around to be strong-armed by governments (he just met with Vladimir Putin!). Bitcoin's absence of a leader is causing problems in the short term (scaling debate etc.), but is likely to be a huge strength longer term.

Depends on the specific wallet - some have a 'seed phrase', a dozen or more random words from which your wallet can be derived - others you need to write down your private key(s), which will be a long string of numbers &amp; letters beginning with a 5, a K or an L.

Ethereum is pretty fancy tech, and the people behind it are impressive. But whereas I understand Bitcoin's value, I don't get why Ether has significant value.

If I send 1BTC to each of 10 addresses in your wallet, and you then want to send your 10BTC to another address, the fee will be higher than if I'd originally sent you 10BTC in one go.
Basically the fee pays for your transaction's space in a block. Rolling up those 10 transactions (which are now inputs for your new transaction) into one makes your 10BTC transaction larger, so it takes up more block space.

Remember miners pay their costs in fiat.


Assuming the same tx volume as now, if the price dropped to $100 per BTC, the fee denominated in BTC would rise, the fee denominated in fiat would remain unchanged, because we're buying block space. Miners have to be able to pay their costs, which are unchanged by the drop in BTC value. And they have no more block space to sell than before.

You have to import the private key.
edit to add: since electrum is derived from a seed, you need to be careful - any funds associated with an imported private key cannot be retrieved using the seed. To maintain the 'restore from seed' functionality you need to send (i.e. as a transaction) the bitcoin from the imported address to one generated by the wallet.
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:39:26
I'd prefer if Segwit was activated immediately, but if not, UASF/BIP148 is the back-up plan.
UASFs don't introduce a hard fork, but there may temporarily be a chain split (some miners on one side, some on the other). Chain splits happen almost daily, and are resolved quickly.
If UASF/BIP148 is successful (essentially guaranteed if the hash rate is above 20% of total), blocks mined on the non-UASF side will disappear (=reorganised), and with them all transactions contained therein.
BIP148 hash rate is different from segwit hash rate. BIP148 is a method of activating segwit, so miners might want segwit but not via this UASF.
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:40:31
Ỳou're confused I think. We're trying to activate segwit, not segwit2x.

What's wrong with 2MB blocks as/when needed? Why does everyone feel the need to commit to an arbitrary timetable? You're proposing to fiddle with a key variable in a protocol governing +$40 billion - surely better to base scaling on careful assessment rather than 'what sounds good'?
And again - if we *have* to hard fork, let's do more than simply bump the block size.

I'm not sure, but...
There's a bunch of spare HDD space in the world, and it would be worth something to be able to free that up/put it to use.
Putting that thought to one side for a moment, you may also see that Bitcoin could be considered a mechanism for putting spare hash power to work, rewarding those who demonstrate spare hashing capacity.
Well then, could there be a similar thing to bitcoin, but which is secured by proof of storage capacity? I don't think it works without a valuable token (so it couldn't be *purely* for data storage), but you'd be taking the bitcoin model and, with some adaptation, replacing wasteful PoW with something very useful.

A potential eightfold increase in block size, as segwit2x is, will centralise Bitcoin.

If Bitcoin was different, segwit2x would be safe.
Agreed, but we have to deal with real life, not how we wish things were. In any case, you must see that to introduce a hard fork that *only* changes the block size is a waste of everyone's time. A HF is an opportunity to do lots of cool stuff like schnorr/MAST/spoonnet/etc.
I think as more people understand what's going on here, they realise that the plans core devs have made (though perhaps counter-intuitive at first) are optimal, and that perhaps the best approach for all concerned is, to paraphrase Wittgenstein:

Decentralisation is all that stands between Bitcoin &amp; government control. The more people who are able to run a node, the more decentralised Bitcoin can be.
This is what a node is required to do now:
Segwit2x is (worst case scenario) an eight-fold increase in block size. Such an increase removes the possibility of running a node from an unacceptably high proportion of people.
This doesn't even consider what an eight-fold increase in block space does to the fee market, and by implication the incentive for miners.
Segwit2x is an attack, plain and simple.

It wouldn't make sense to have mining, but then it doesn't make sense for them to use a blockchain (except from a PR perspective). Who knows?

Not at all. Miners' costs are in fiat. Fee size is related to these costs &amp; competition for block space, not the unit price of one bitcoin.

Do we punish all the non-malicious miners who've sunk fortunes into their infrastructure, just to rid us of the bad actors? Sounds like a great way to scare away a key part of the Bitcoin system.
There's a quote by the Sage of Baltimore that should be pinned to the top of all bitcoin forums:


@_date: 2017-06-05 16:26:49


This is nonsensical. Suggested fees have to be given in BTC/byte, because fees relate to how much block space txs take up.


Nothing to do with appreciation vs USD. Fees are higher today because there's more competition for block space than a year ago.
I think we'd better leave it here, I'm sure others will have a better way of explaining this, my way clearly isn't working for you.

Yes, only risk is to coins sent in a transaction while there's a chain split. But I wouldn't store more than about 0.05BTC in either an online or mobile wallet. Paper wallets, hardware wallets, or good old-fashioned electrum-on-TailsOS wallets are the safe options.

To give you a balanced view, there are many users who believe segwit2x to be a bad idea, essentially an attempt to install certain asic manufacturers as the de-facto bosses of bitcoin, rather than retaining the current decentralised system.
Those users would generally prefer BIP141 (segwit) alone to activate, followed by a period of analysis to determine the appropriate next steps (which may well include a block size increase if it's safe/necessary).

Difficulty drops proportionately to the rate at which the mining of new blocks slows. So the mempool builds prior to the difficulty changes. As you rightly say:


Because the mempool is now bigger, the average value of the fees for the top-paying 1MB of txs goes up. But none of this is salient.
The bottom line is there's 1MB of space every 10 mins. Fees are paid to get into this space. The more people trying to get in, the higher the fee required for success.
Difficulty, BTC to USD exchange rate, the weather. None of it matters for fee rates, only the competition for space.

Bob opens a 2 BTC channel with Kraken. So does Alice, who also opens a second 2BTC channel, this time with with Eve.
Eve now sends 1BTC to Bob: Her channel with Alice moves 1BTC in Alice's favour; Then the Alice-Kraken channel moves 1BTC in Kraken's favour; Then the Kraken-Bob channel moves 1BTC in Bob's favour. Alice &amp; Kraken have the same amount of BTC as before, but Eve's 1BTC payment to Bob is now in his channel.
So for your business, instead of opening a channel with every customer, you only need to open a small number (theoretically one, but in practice likely a few) and you're part of a global network, through which payments can be routed.

Why's that? TailsOS has a higher 'barrier to entry' than almost every other OS - programs don't get bundled without extensive review of their security, so including *every* update is not practical/desirable. You sacrifice the latest features for hardened security, a good trade-off.
In any case TailsOS is Linux - you can install/update any program just as you would with e.g. Debian.

I have. Good devs &amp; a good idea. I might grab some (would be my first ETH token), but only for making money in the short term.
It comes back to the fundamental Ethereum problem- The ETH blockchain has grown more than 1GB a day in the last week. That's just not sustainable imho in the context of a decentralised &amp; global blockchain.
I know plans are in the works trying to address scaling, and their dev team is second only to that of BTC, but I need something more substantial before I commit much money. ETH still looks more likely to fail (as a global/decentralised proposition) than succeed to me.

No. The difference is that your bank account money is already native to their system. If you withdraw/transact, you do it under their supervision &amp; with their permission.

For a blend of low technical barrier and high security: 1) Download TailsOS, burn to disc. 2) Boot into TailsOS, open Electrum &amp; generate a seed. 3) Note down both the seed words (on paper) &amp; a Bitcoin address (on a USB stick). 4) Send funds to address.
You only need to keep the seed words safe - Mine ended up stuck in my memory after looking at them once a day for a few weeks, but I've got them stored safely too.

Electrum seed phrases only work with Electrum. Most other wallets that derive keys from a bunch of words are compatible with each other, but Electrum isn't.

You're thinking about security as a binary state, but it's not.

At times in every country's past there have been different denominations within the main unit of account. The UK has its pound, but everyday folk might have used farthings, ha'pennys, shillings, florins, crowns, etc., depending on the time period.
Bitcoin is currently moving to fast for such names to establish themselves. But if it continues to spread, volatility will decrease and appropriate/useful terms will be established.

It's valid, but kinda weak, betraying (imho) misconceptions about how such things work. It comes down to how and why words are invented. Humans just do it naturally when it's needed. Clearly it's not needed yet.
Many promote the use of the term 'bits', equivalent to 100 satoshis, but it hasn't (yet) caught on - part of the delay being bitcoin's rapidly increasing value, which makes settling on an appropriate fraction difficult. But something will, it's just how language works.

If you can only increase block size by a small amount *safely*, then you better make sure you wring the most out of the space you have. This is the idea behind segwit, as opposed to a basic block size increase.
The plan core devs came up with - actual *years* ago now - is to activate segwit then assess its impact on the system - in terms of scaling, sure, but also in terms of the economy of Bitcoin (e.g. does it disrupt the way miners' incentives work). It's only after such analysis has taken place that we can reasonably have views on increasing the block size.
If a block size increase is both safe &amp; necessary post-segwit, then I will be all for it. But it's not something you can know in advance, Bitcoin's too complex.
We'd already be in the post-segwit analysis phase were it not for bad actors using their mining dominance to hold technical advancement to ransom.
(edit to add: remember, segwit is a real-terms block increase of about 2.2MB *right now*. That is, if you look at the transactions filling blocks today, you can fit 2.2 times as many in segwit-activated blocks. This ignores tech like lightning which may provide for more than a thousand-fold increase in transaction capacity)

It's the biggest problem with this setup, which is why I only recommend it for storage rather than for spending wallets.

It's a clash of personalities between two camps of good guys pretending it's about  each others' tech deficiencies. A shame.
It started because the AntiSamourai group feels that Samourai devs overstate their security/privacy features (there's some truth to this, despite it being a very nice mobile wallet in comparison to the competition). Samourai devs feel that similar criticisms can be made of the wallets favoured by the AntiSamourai group, and that they're being singled out unfairly (a claim also not without foundation). It's all a bit virtue-signally - lots of pearl-clutching &amp; mock concern for the public good.
Nobody emerges from it smelling of roses, but I suspect it might be the price we pay for the behaviours needed to keep scams under control.

My main way of acquiring bitcoin is to buy as much as I can with it, then replace it with ~10% more than I used.
Tends to be purchases in the $60 - $300 range, like clothes, computing equipment, etc. Basically whenever I buy something, I look hard to see if a there's a company that sells it &amp; takes BTC.
It probably costs me ~5% more than if I was using visa or whatever (exchange fees plus a reduced selection), but I've more than made that back in hodling the change.

There's no point buying if you don't intend to spend at *some* stage.

The revolutionary benefits of blockchain only exist when a valuable token (i.e. bitcoin) underpins the system.
Blockchains without this feature are certainly useful in some situations, but the reason blockchain is even a thing we discuss is because of what it becomes when yoked to a currency.
As such, mass adoption of blockchains without valuable tokens makes no sense when other database solutions are better for most use cases.

The programs are using relatively simple &amp; widely understood methods to go from your seed phrase to key pairs, so even if they 'cease to exist' somehow, their function will be trivial to recreate.


Just the one used to create the wallet, generally.

If they're just wanting to store BTC for long periods, you could do much worse than set them up wallets in electrum on tailsOS.
They'll end up with a seed phrase (usually random 13 words) which they store on paper, in their heads, inscribed in steel, or whatever. The beauty is that it's free, easy, and as safe as anything you can buy. The downside is it's (a little) more hassle to spend from than e.g. a trezor.
With this method you can also export a master public key for each of them which they can use to 'supervise' addresses (on a pc or phone wallet), making sure their coins are safe without risking any losses. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:12:33
Electrum (the default wallet on TailsOS) seeds are incompatible with mycelium ones. Do you just mean encrypt the seed alongside your persistent TailsOS profile? This would be secure, if awkward (I'd transition to Electrum if TailsOS is something you use much).
Sounds like you're doing the right things, but you know, "Gubba nub nub doo rah kah".

Worth adding definitions for any noobs reading:
* "Import" here means adding the private key to your wallet.
* "Sweep" here means sending coins to an address whose keys are already part of your wallet.
Not knowing the difference can be costly - wallets derived from seeds *cannot* restore imported private keys from the seed. So you lose bitcoin sent to an imported key if you have to restore from seed. Always better to sweep addresses in this situation, both for the reason above, and because you're trusting the ATM not to spill your private key.

Segwit (also known as BIP141) is a technical change to the way blocks in the blockchain are formatted. It will result in blocks that have up to 4 times the capacity of today's ones, and enable a host of 'layer two' technologies that will enhance Bitcoin's functionality.

You should do a bunch of reading before you commit significant sums to Bitcoin, you will lose money otherwise.
But basically, they create (but not broadcast to the Bitcoin network) a transaction that you can, in the event the service goes down, broadcast yourself. This transaction returns your coins to an address you can access without the website (e.g. in another wallet).
