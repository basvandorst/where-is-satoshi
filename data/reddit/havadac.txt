Well, IOTA is not exactly free to transact with. To include your transaction in the tangle, your device has to compute some proof of work. That extra energy your device burns is your "fee".

I am all in for bank transparency, and Bitcoin and this community makes it hard not to be transparent. But how do we know if for example BitStamp is not running fractional reserve? Gox kind of was for awhile.
And you're right, as owners we should not tolerate lack of transparency. And I am against fractional reserve banking and making money out of thin air. Maybe I got downvoted because I did not make this clear.

"extending credit" is actually making money out of thin air (writing a number in a database), then lending it to you at interest.

There is probably a law in Japan that says you have to put a phone number up when filing for bankruptcy. So here it is! 
Now we have a loop, the website says to call the number, and the number says to go to the website. Brilliant scheme! While we are distracted, This buys Mark time so he can finish writing PHP to reprogram the elevator of the building, or the Frappuccino machine.

Bitcoin is deflationary, discourages growth: this is in line with reality: the planet has finite resources and can't sustain endless growth. Maybe we can switch back to inflationary currencies once we find out how to get out of Earth and have to colonize another planet or solar system!

Well, I would do business with them. I would be owner, so I would want to use my own exchange. Also, I would advocate and promote my company to my friends. And there are lots of "shareholder" that would think similarly. This could save Gox.

Well, I think one has to be smart enough to know when to surround oneself with smarter individuals. That is not measured in that test, I believe. I really got angry after reading this article.
I think one of the biggest mistakes he made and that I will try to learn from (a costly lesson for me, to be honest) is not to be alone in your company: being the only shareholder means yes, you get all the profits, yes you can do what you want, but it also means nobody is giving you serious advice, you don't get other points of view from other angles (e.g. PR, finance...) and no one is sharing a stake on what you do.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:37:36
This is the kind of solution that the Bitcoin community needs: a "distributed" solution and the ways that things are done now. This means we demonstrate that regulation is not the way to resolve this (and has not fixed other cracks before) but instead that we crowdsource a solution and the community is mature enough to repair things on our own
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:51:59
What I said is that there is nothing in Bitcoin that *prevents* fractional reserve banking. Well, you're not supposed to do fractional reserve banking with Bitcoin, but you can do it nevertheless. As a matter of fact, exchanges right now could be doing it and we wouldn't know.
If you get a bank run, however, you're dead on the spot. Nobody can bail you out without giving you bitcoins they can't print. For example, like Gox.

I would never recommend anything to my friends that I didn't approve of. If Gox relaunched under this concept, it'd be under a completely new team that is transparent, respected and trusted.

It would not be "them" anymore, it would be "us". New management altogether. Mark would just be there momentarily to explain that mess of PHP code with SQL code embedded and then get the hell out of the way.
@_date: 2014-03-28 23:32:00
My point exactly. You can't print bitcoins, however you can do transactions off the blockchain. This has to be prevented by the community / users by being educated and  just not using those services, but the protocol itself does not prevent it. We're all learning from Gox
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:42:42

Dear &lt;%=message.getFrom %&gt;
Thank you for your feedback.
Please know that at this time we only accept &lt;%=getPaymentMethodsList() %&gt;. Here are the cards we accept
&lt;% for n=0 to cards.length %&gt;
-- &lt;%=cards(n)%&gt;
&lt;% next n %&gt;
You can learn more about these payment methods on our Help pages &lt;%=GetHelpPageLink() %&gt;
But down't worry, I've already sent your issue to the &lt;%=selectRandomTeam() %&gt; team so that they can make &lt;%=getCustomerRequest() %&gt; available as payment method. As per experience, request like this are granted shorly after they've been reported.
Thank you,
&lt;%=getRandomName %&gt;
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:19:51
I am not sure if I can answer your question. But here are some thoughts: I don't think there is anything in the bitcoin system that prevents a future bank from running on a fractional reserve system. This means that in the scenario you describe banks could still issue loans for more bitcoins than they really have, thus increasing the amount of bitcoins in circulation. This could ease the deflationary context. 
Another thought is that if the only currency in the world is Bitcoin, then its supply represents all the wealth/resource ownership in the world, therefore as the population grows, it is of higher and higher value as people compete for the same limited resources. 
The bank lent you 1BTC, but I would say the house is more valuable in the long run (more people, same planet surface) , therefore valid as collateral. Anyway, sorry for the rambling, I hope this helps. 
**EDIT:** I am against fractional reserve banking and making money out of thin air. While a bad practice, I believe banks/exchanges can do this with Bitcoin and we must demand auditing and transparency otherwise not do business with them.

No. You'd never know this happened unless you checked the logs. The car puke sensor detected it and automatically demanded additional payment to the passenger before opening the door locks. Then, it went to an automated car wash to have everything cleaned out.

In order to really build a "time-locked" safe with nLockTime, you would need to sign a transaction with nLockTime sending all the coins to yourself to a different address in the future and then effectively destroying the private key you used (to avoid anyone from stealing it and sign an immediate transaction to themselves) . You would then store that transaction in a safe place until it is time to broadcast it. If someone stole the transaction, it would not matter since it cannot be altered and the only thing the thief can do is broadcast it. 
Be careful, however, do not lose that transaction since you'll need it in the future. It is safe to make copies of it everywhere as it is useless for everybody else.
