Firstly, I am no expert in these matters so trust me at your own risk.

Secondly, a spike might or might not be temporary. It depends on the reason of spike. For an instance, if you are following Bitcoin Cash then you might be aware of what happend two weeks ago. Its price rose up sharply but fell sharply soon afterwards. This was because nothing **fundamental** about the Bitcoin Cash had changed and when price rose up, people didn't believe that the price could be sustained at this level, so they started selling heavily in order to book profits.

However, if the spike is due to some change which can affect the price in the long run then it might not come down. For an example, if tomorrow JP Morgan decides to enter BTC market then price will definitely shoot up. But simultaneously people's trust in BTC will also increase which means they might not sell shortly afterwards and they might prefer holding it.

He probably means that liquidity of bitcoin isn't much meaning that most Bitcoins are **being held** rather than being used for transactions. In such a case, if there is a sudden demand for  Bitcoins, say by a firm who wants to enter Bitcoin market, then that will mean a sudden shoot up of the value of Bitcoin, not because the Bitcoins are not there, but because Bitcoins are not available **for sale** i.e., they are not liquid. Such, a shoot up of price is probably what he means by *liquidity spike*
