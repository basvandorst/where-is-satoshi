@_date: 2018-01-15 06:21:35
A little greed helps more people get on the bus. The bus in this case is a worldwide currency that is (hopefully) beyond the control of the elites. With cash being phased out, we need an alternative now more than ever. Kyc and aml is just another form of control imho. Don’t be too dismayed with the greed, it is a byproduct of this massive social experiment which is far more important than lambos and bling.
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:27:15
Well it is only stuff, I had so much crap just holding onto it in case I might need it one day but all it did was take up space. Consumerism is so unnecessary and wasteful.

@_date: 2018-01-09 03:32:28
As in anyone can post whatever crap code they like and instantly gain approval? That’s why we have forks.

This all feels like a bait and switch agenda. Bcash was supported by bad actors that know the infighting is good for their alt coin.

Absolutely agree. while my comment was tongue in cheek, I would also advise to not hold back and use any means to bring an adversary down. Aikido teaches to use an aggressor's own energy against them and target the squishy bits. Having said all that, prevention is better than a cure.

You and others keep talking about rushing to other cryptos that are more “advanced”, what is this advancement that you so clearly spell out? More robust use cases/ benefits, what are they? Because it sounds just like hollow rhetoric.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:53:22
If we are talking about the masses, sure. But there will always be those that know quality and willing to pay more for it. Large companies have thrived with quality over quantity.
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:29:18
All I can say is that the amount of toxic energy directed towards bitcoin, it shows the devs must be doing something right.

set fees manually, don't use the usual crap wallets. never paid more than a couple of dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:18:17
people who cling to the current model rarely see innovation as a good thing as it affects what they know and understand. If you applied this analogy to bitcoin then we could see a lot of hodlers lose out big time if they ignore what others are doing in the cryptocurrency space. The difference is that the project is opensource and with consensus, it should be able to adapt and evolve. However, there are concerned individuals who would rather see that not happen.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:05:50

@_date: 2017-12-29 03:57:49
exchanges are making a killing on the fees, mostly from greedy speculators that don't care what the fee is. Looking at the mempool right now, it makes no sense why such high fees are even being used.

I was making a point (perhaps not clearly) that his argument was over simplistic in comparison with the privacy debate. Cash is being fazed out and I would prefer something like bitcoin than a government/bankster version. Exchanges are monitored but only the in and out flows.

to confuse people into buying bcash instead of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-09 01:07:24
I believe the important reason is money is moving to digital format where everything is tracked and monitored. Bitcoin allows anonymous transactions just like cash. Yes you can be tracked when converting to and from fiat, but what happens in between is important. Central banks devaluing the currencies in order to create a functioning society is another story.

Not that agree with everything he says but his view that education is not preparing people for the real world is valid and debt is a form of slavery is pretty spot on. Cash rules if it is used as a tool to grow your wealth. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:39:18
He was insulting people with his asinine method of communication.
@_date: 2018-08-13 15:30:22
You yourself admitted you haven't read his book and you are way off the mark with your assumptions. He doesn't say debt is bad or that you shouldn't get a home loan What he says is that most people, including highly educated people view wealth as the equity in their own home and a savings plan. That is not how you generate real wealth. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 10:33:03
So you saying he was original? 
@_date: 2018-05-21 01:56:19
I think it means there are more irrational assholes than there are calm and considerate people in the world these days.

Your point is a little political don’t you think? A dev can indeed be trustworthy, actually it is quite important their reputation is trustworthy, usually decided upon by previous actions.

But you are tied to a plug in the wall, even with a wireless landline, you are tethered to a certain radius, thus mobiles were an improvement as it broke that tether. Cash is great but bitcoin allows this to continue on a digital platform, reaching globally, instantaneously.

Timeframes can be adjusted to suite the point of view. I agree with you about land and also the volatility of bitcoin. However, if you bought bitcoin prior to 3rd qtr last year, you would still have reason to smile. Looking forward, Insee no reason why bitcoin cannot continue to be a disruptor in the finance space. Whether it would be a wise decision to use it as a store of wealth is truly unknown at this stage, but fortune favors the brave.
@_date: 2018-10-31 02:36:20

That is a straight up ignorant opinion. Can you say the same about the Cuban health system? Or their education system for churning high quality medical practitioners.

Well the bad news in japan is accounts are under review, which is (for some exchanges) grinding deposits and withdrawals to an excruciating slowdown. New accounts are also taking longer to be verified, which I believe would be putting pressure on the sell price.    
As for the hacks, always bad news. This will slow down new money coming in, again more pressure on the sell side.

With the large sell volumes, I wouldn’t be buying anything right now, if we do get any recovery in the short term, you can almost guarantee another wave of selling will be inbound. Unless of course if I sell, then it is guaranteed to shoot to all new highs. Dyor though.

With regards to tracking, just remember your average buy price and go with a site like cryptowat.ch or bitcoinwisdom.com, don't need any complex analysis.

Electrum has been fine for me and setting fees manually can save you a lot of money. You just need to keep an eye on the mempool before sending and you should have no problems for around $0.5 - $1.

have a look at this site and you can see the unconfirmed transactions and the associated fees:

In my opinion a truly decentralized store of wealth is something worth fighting for and protecting. Something that the banksters can't taint.

Income tax is theft:  
UK      
Income Tax was the first tax in British history to be levied directly on people's earnings. It was introduced in 1799 by the then Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger, as a temporary measure to cover the cost of the Napoleonic Wars.
   
Australia    
Federal income tax was first introduced in 1915, in order to help fund Australia's war effort in the First World War. Between 1915 and 1942, income taxes were levied at both the state and federal level. The Taxation Administration Act 1953 was assented to on 4 March 1953.    
    
Passed by Congress on July 2, 1909, and ratified February 3, 1913, the 16th amendment established Congress's right to impose a Federal income tax.    
There are plenty of ways for governments to raise money but easier just to take it from the workers. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:18:47

Took myself time to come round and almost everyone I have spoken to about it. First it was thinking it was a scam, then when I did get interested, I looked into alts. Eventually coming back to bitcoin and hodling since. These guys just going through the same phases, maybe with different perspectives due to their gigs but they will arrive at the same outcome.

It still amazes me people can only think in the whole rounded number sense. Why did someone spend $70 on bitcoin? Owning .01 bitcoin allows you to do the same that someone could do 1 year ago with .1 bitcoin. The difference is more people want a piece so it costs more to obtain. What screwed the scenario up was the greed. I believe you cannot see past the store of value scenario.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:26:58
sounding very positive, in a cautious tone.
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:34:42
A year ago it was in the midst of a blocksize debate that was fracturing the community and showing signs of life again after the last pump and dump, 3 years prior. I would say bitcoin is stronger and healthier than ever, right now. Today's current price would still be considered very strong, even if it had never reached the recent highs.    
Bitcoin is swinging back to the micropayment solution and the 2nd layer will bring a much needed confidence boost. We can only wonder where we would be right now if the bcash crew had not been so destructive and bloody minded.
@_date: 2018-02-11 01:33:07
The bigger concern is the removal of physical cash. Fiat may continue but as an unaccountable form of digital currency that is easier to control the masses with. Bitcoin makes it harder for these people to fudge the books.

An intelligent argument against bitcoin you present but much faith in the system you have. After 2007, I would not trust the government or “corporate citizens” ever again. My faith is with an anonymous digital currency that is backed by a network that is controlled by no one single entity. Whether it is bitcoin still remains to be seen but all others are a distraction.
