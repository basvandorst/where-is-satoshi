I'm not saying Ethereum is a good idea, but there is nothing bad about broadcasting crashing code, it will just cost you virtual CPU cycles, which you or someone else pays for.
Their great problem is making the virtual machine solid, safe and producing consitent results. Again pointing out that I'm not a fan of everything planned for Ethereum


Yes you should, in a fork. Zerocoin is also doing the right thing by forking and trying it out. That backdoor thing is just sensationalist slander, once the code is audited these concerns will be limited, and why wait for bitcoin-Qt devs to test the implementation?

Now the "benefit massively" sets into play, and *another you* appears and want to change protocol again, because psychology.

Note that I was only remarking on Proof of Work. With trusted parties which are legal entities in the real world, you can have a (to participants) public ledger and voting based on tokens, like PoS or a generic pre-blockchain consensus algorithm. maybe what VISA or Mastercard is using internally seems to work great, considering their throughput.
You also have higher bandwidth and fewer well-connected nodes who do the talking.

This is a bit bold, the network does not scale past 7 transactions per second right now. So I think that would make transactions very expensive. Maybe the concept cryptocurrency theoretically satisfy your claim. There is great work being done on this though, I just hope it won't require a hard-fork.


What do you mean by peddling his modifications? How can you make it that a researcher, who's sharing his work and  fungibility-proofing, sound so sleazy? :)
I want to know what the devs said about Zerocoin, anyone have a good source or some info about this?
And about ethereum, how do you know it is such a complex beast like you claim? I know it isn't ready and haven't looked into it much, but the idea seems feasible. Does anyone have a good reason why it def. would not work out as they claim? 
ofc there can be unknown weirdness with turing-complete scripting, but wouldn't it also allow for simpler designs than current cryptocurrencies processing?

First off, I understand he's talking about social factors and certain adoption curves, I don't disagree with the possibility of that changing, but..

I'm sorry for acting rude. But it's just, it's hard enough to change consensus systems, they are resistive to change by nature.
It's just way easier to use the prefixes and say millies, micros or satoshis. No miner will hardfork for cosmetic reasons. Bitcoin wallet clients will easily change the way they represent the units in the interface.

ASICs are better, because they are freely reproducible by a large number of factories. The problem with graphics cards is that we only have two manufacturers.

IPv6 addresses also belongs to US department of defence, then we have a bunch of ISPs, which always have been doing what the prism companies have been exposed of doing.
Sure, we could decide to leave out all of these "bad actors" and just stick with the rest. But, considering claiming a new address full of cryptocoin wealth, basically just changing IPs, we have problems such as spoofing, or a [sybil attack]( So the distribution will end up in the hands of botnet owners and various "shady people". 
Shady in the eyes of the society, who in the end are the ones bootstrapping value and decide weather these v6coins are good money. So for a coin relying on its initial distribution model, to me it would almost seem as if the opposite is in fact true. :)

One safe way of handling bitcoin is to have one offline computer and one online computer, a so called airgap. Say we want to pay from our "offline wallet":
The process:
* Offline: generate a new wallet, write down or memorize the 12 word seed. Go to the menu Wallet-&gt;Master public key
* Online: Set up a "watching wallet", menu New/restore-&gt;Restore wallet from master public key, enter the "Offline master public key" from step 1.
* Online: paste address or scan public address QR with webcam. Enter amount and fee. Click show unsigned TxQR.
* Offline: Click "Scan TxQR", point webcam at Online computer. Sign the transaction.
* Online: Scan the signed transaction from the Offline computer. Broadcast the transaction.
I think this is how it works, someone please correct me if I remembered it wrong.
The master public key can generate every public key to the private seed in the offline wallet, it's deterministic just like the Electrum private key. With Electrum you never have to resync your backups like with bitcoin-Qt, because the most recent copy decided to regenerate 100 new private keys.
zbar is available in Debian and Fedora repos.

I might have been wrong that it solves the double-spend, but it does however enable an exchange of the transaction itself between the merchant and customer.
If both the merchant and customer broadcast the same transaction, this will enable instant payment. Also, since it can be assumed the merchant is better connected than the smartphone user. The chance of double spend decreases.

Even though I'm a developer by trade, it comes across as kind of hand-wavy to just refer to the code. :)
To me the proof is in the pudding. It sure looks like turing complete scripting on the blockchain would simplify things such as contracts, applications, oracles and what have you.
But until we actually see some results, we cannot say we know what "the functionality needed" really is. Ethereum might provide all this, that's why I said might and that's what might means.

Closed source software and patents can (and most probably will) do that to a product. Lock down your market share and prevent competing software or platforms to use the communication protocol. But I don't really think it has that much to do with the COO as you might think, if a business model is profitable, many members will pursue that in the name of (perhaps short term) business sense.
