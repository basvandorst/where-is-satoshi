Any particular wallet you'd recommend?

You could not order weapons on SR. Maybe at some early point you could but when I used to visit (while Ross was still in charge) you could not. There where other onion sites to buy weapons or hits, but even those were likely just scams.

That makes sense, and is pretty much the same way my wife feels about it. I drink 1-2gal/week so I go with the cheaper stuff, but they drink organic.

In my case the transaction just got stuck in limbo. People told me it would return to my wallet in two weeks and then it just didn't. So it's just unconfirmed probably forever.

Meant to hit 122sat, which at the time was a reasonable fee. I appreciate any effort.

I paid too low a fee and my $60 is gone forever. Trapped since Dec 16. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:49:15
Tried several with no luck. If there is a recommended paid one I'd give it a try. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:00:53
Mistyped.

Doge is a great coin. Fast cheap transactions and good boy.

Ugh maybe I should lower my milk consumption so that organic wouldn't seem so expensive. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:48:24
Have no other BTC in that account. Unfortunately with fees as they are right now I don't think two additional transfers are really worth it. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:01:26
Why organic? Not a loaded question, I just can't figure out the benefit.

I wish I could buy bitcoin with bitcoin

I use Bitcoin to buy steroids, as others have pointed out, illicit purchases are why the currency has survived and gained value. Almost all the steroid vendors take BTC and Western Union. Right now Western Union is the only reasonable option.

I just found an old wallet from 2013 where I redeemed reddit karma for 0.002 BTC which was like $0.13 at the time and is now $40ish.

Over 90% of day traders lose money, and only 1 or 2% consistently outperform the market. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:28:36
My last purchase is 7 days and hasn't cleared yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:43:24
Waiting 10 days on a $3 fee transfer.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:38:18
Unfortunately none of the sources for raws that I know of take Monero. I'm about to place an order though so I'll probably ask my vendor if they'll accept it in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:35:49
Easier said than done, unfortunately.

The VAST majority of day traders lose money.

If it is short term and taxed as income then why wouldn't $600 be the threshold for paying taxes? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:17:42
Very difficult for the IRS to track and punish, so for the time being I'm reporting zero BTC related taxes (almost all of my BTC gets spent rather than sold). I mean...how many people do you know that track and pay a Use Tax for items purchased online from out of state vendors? Probably none, which in most places is a tax violation.

If you think you can consistently beat the market for thirty years then go ahead, you'll be managing hundred million dollar funds in just a matter of years.

Well the drugs are steroids, so I doubt that. I'll take my investment advice from Benjamin Graham and leave you to make your millions.

I'm in the same boat as you. We are going to be waiting.

I'm guessing you are unaware that Cuba has incredible healthcare, and better health outcomes in almost every metric than the United States.

I'm interested in BTC as a currency and not an investment, right now it functions horribly.  
I don't doubt people can make money from it, but for those of us just wanting to buy things it is super frustrating and I hope it improves substantially (or altcoin acceptance becomes more widespread).
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:52:15
Nobody could know that. Buy when you think it is low enough to be a good value.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:15:10
I mean when I was looking through old emails last night to find an old wallet last night (that had .003BTC on it) I found a money order confirmation in 2013 when I bought a bitcoin. Scoured my inbox and the hard drive of my old computer but have zero knowledge of that wallet address.  
Finding $60 became much less fun when I realize I also had $19k I couldn't find. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:17:37
I've never attempted because it is a losing proposition. Many people confuse luck for skill, and keep at it until they lose whatever they gained. Even "winners" often still underperform the market after a few years, and would have been better off just buying intelligently and holding. I imagine you are smarter and more capable than 95+% of traders though, and since you have computers running algorithms and executing lightning fast transactions with huge amounts of money without waiting on user input you are always ahead of the competition. Your Lamborghini days are on the horizon.  
When I want to gamble I play Blackjack; with correct play I can cut the house edge to 1%. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:34:42
Is that not seen as a tremendous weakness in BTC? If it can depreciate by 10% in a day because of "coordinated attacks" that is kind of terrible and real weakness for something that's supposed to function as a currency.

Is "saving some cash when I spend it all on drugs" a legit reason? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:31:11
Steroids and raw pharmaceuticals are what I use if for, and ocassionally cannabis.
