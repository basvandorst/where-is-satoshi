Thank you for your question. We were not promoting Bitcoin mining or Bitcoin as an Investment. We were explaining to people who have never heard of Bitcoin before, what it is, and how it can benefit them. The mining demo was there to provide  a physical example of the kind of things that people are doing and also as an aid to explaining the technology.

"Finally – virtual currencies were huge this year, with a large number of new businesses founded based on Bitcoin and others. These offered services like wallets, payment acceptance, and cross-border payments. Interestingly, some of these Bitcoin companies have potential to bring down cross-border payment costs significantly compared to alternatives like wires and SWIFT. **However, most people are still a little unsure about dealing with such a volatile medium of exchange with fairly sketchy origins and a reclusive Japanese inventor. And though some Bitcoin fans were unhappy that New York state is making moves to license any business that trades in Bitcoin – it may be the first sign that virtual currencies like Bitcoin are approaching legitimacy.**"

I'd like to see them deploy an EV SSL CERTIFICATE.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:57:57
The source code as of now:
	&lt;head&gt;
		&lt;title&gt;MtGox.com&lt;/title&gt;
	&lt;/head&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;!-- put announce for mtgox acq here --&gt;
	&lt;/body&gt;

Could someone send us a test tip to check our integration is working? We will send it back.

Xero is another excellent online accountancy solution and Nowell Associates have been trying to see if we can get Xero to add native bitcoin support, via dialog with our account manager and also via twitter:
Something that our clients quite honestly need. If this is something you would like to see integrated into Xero then it may well be worth you speaking to your Accountant, Xero account manager or these chaps in order to let them know that there is demand out there, for this functionality.

Really Cool!

It might help if LB used an EV SSL Certificate..

From the page:
"From December 2013 Nowell Associates accepts Bitcoin and Litecoin in payment for our Accountancy, Taxation, IT &amp; Data Security services. We believe in the future of Crypto Currency and feel that the time is right for businesses such as ours to take the initiative and support this new method of payment. We believe we are one of the first Accountancy firms in England to take this step."
