So I should own my own keys? Hahaha kidding. But if my Bitcoin are on Blockchain.info do I control my own keys?

What's the difference between the Coinbase GDAX exchange and the coinbase app (I use the coinbase app). Also, how can I not market buy on the exchange? Thanks a lot man.

Ok thanks so much. Last question, where do you think I should store my Bitcoin? Leave them in coinbase? Transfer them to Blockchain.info? Or send them somewhere else?
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:47:39
Do you know if it is easy to transfer coins to that wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:56:17
I have some Bitcoins that are in a Blockchain.info wallet that I haven't split yet and have more Bitcoins on coinbase. I want to move the Bitcoins I have on coinbase to my Blockchain.info wallet. Can I do this and then in the future split the Bitcoins I had before Aug 1st? Or is it too much of a mess? 
Also, Coinbase claims they will support Bitcoin cash before Jan 2018. Does this mean if you have coins in coinbase aftee Aug 1st you can still get Bitcoin cash?

So what should I do if I have Bitcoins on coinbase and want to send it to a wallet but not pay fees. Do I send the Bitcoins from coinbase to gdax and then to my wallet? Also, is it ok to keep bitcoin on gdax for a couple days?

Would a good way to get started in holding your BTC in a paper wallet is start with just 10 dollars to see if everything goes as planned. And if everything goes well transfer the rest of BTC to the paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:19:47
There is a 0% you could turn a million dollars into 4 billion+. Your naive if you think Trump "inherited" his wealth.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:30:38
4600 or so. I don't feel bad for myself because I'm not a little baby. I knew what I was getting myself into and that is how Bitcoin works. It's volatile. Get used to it

Not necessarily. I'm sure a lot of people care about you. But I'm just tired of people complaining about their loses. You signed up for this and hopefully you knew something like this could happen. Bitcoin is volatile and will be doing this for a long time.

There are definitely "sub-traits" if you will. I'm going to edit and include people that don't have knowledge on it but still hate on it.

That's what I thought. So now what should I do in my position if I want the Bitcoin gold? Should I keep my BTC where it is and wait for my BTC gold? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:33:01
I don't think so. A lot of people on this sub are sometimes ignorant to the fact that Bitcoin has some question marks, no? I think it's fine that some knowledgeable people oppose Bitcoin because there are some proponents that could lead Bitcoin to 0. Also a lot that could lead the price to 100k. 
I agree 4) would be people that are uninformed but still have an opinion. That could fall under trait 2 but I think I'm going to edit and include 4.

What if I have my BTC  in GDAX? Will I still get Bitcoin gold?
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:06:18
Why couldn't I just transfer my BTC now to my Trezor and still be fine for the fork in November?

Not a problem. I just saw someone taking about it in a video and wanted to do some research. It seems the only way to set it up is plug in the Trezor, go to the Trezor wallet and activate the passphrase. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:18:57
Should I do the same if my BTC is in GDAX?

Do you think more people 40-60 years of age are going to become more  interested in investing in Bitcoin in the future? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:38:36
There aren't a lot. Especially on this sub.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:26:02
There are apparently a PIN, a seed (24 words) and an optional passphrase that is known as your 25th word seed. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:33:11
Apparently the fork happened way earlier than expected. What are you going to do?
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:47:44
Great! Thanks. Now it doesn't matter what I do about the S2X fork BUT what about the Bitcoin Gold fork that happened a couple days ago? I have my BTC in GDAX if I want that Bitcoin gold should I keep my Bitcoin in GDAX and not transfer it to my Trezor?
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:43:33
Thanks a lot! So Ik a lot of people say Ledger is the better and for your buck but rn on Amazon it looks like Ledger nano s is going for around 78 dollars and Trezor is going for 85. What would you do?
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:17:17
GDAX is doing the same thing coinbase is? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:36:46
Great. I have Trezor. Should I transfer my GDAX Bitcoin to my Trezor now? Or is it not a good idea because of the Bitcoin gold fork yesterday?

Wow I feel so bad for you! (Sarcasm)

So I can't use Blockchain.info for my wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:23:39
How can I own m private keys? I have a small amount of bitcoin with coinbase right now. Can I send the coins to Blockchain.info? Is that secure? I'm not going to buy a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:01:48
Do you think other people did the same? Yes. Stop complaining.
