 Yes, but lower tx fees allows for more users. And with increased usage we will get higher fees again.
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:14:23
Miners like it aswell since it can fit more transactions per block.

I belive he is a good Guy too, however I think this will be like the BFL delays and he will make it work but it will take time. GL Sebastian :D

Thats exactly what it is about. And that is why there is still a chance that Leah is not a cunt but the evidence is strongly suggesting that is the case as proven in my article.
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:38:23
Apparently it does and I will now go cry a little:'(

I think the reason why devs is more excited about bitcoin then other people is because we understand the properties of the underlying technologies.
For example SHA256 hashing: we have used it and know that is has a deterministic "randomness" and using proof of work seems reasonable to us. However a "techie" never sees those technologies because its hidden in the databases and in the protocols. A "techie" ever encounters a hash in the form of a password that they type in to a form. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 09:09:00
Exactly, it is not true for all useful hash algorithms but there is a couple of requirements thats needed to get a viable hashing algorithm for decentralized blockchains: 
-the amount of solutions need to be almost infinite or atleast a lot of them.
-The previous block must have a value that is required in the hashing algorithm so you can't precompute blocks.
-Verifying the solution must be much faster than solving the problem.

I just made some forensics research. I even connected the dots and the only results I got was: Leah is with high probabilty a cunt.
Some may question my methods but its not about finding out whos a cunt but who is not a cunt and Leah have not denied being a cunt in the recent YT clips I have been watching.

A folding hash coin would require a centrAl authority to control the arbitrary inputs to the useful hash algorithm. Why primecoin works is because it dont need any arbitrary inputs.

Mining is expensive by design and the miners are subsidised by new coins at the moment. Bitcoin will never beat visa or mastercard in speed and price because they dont need to decentralize or keep the full transaction history redundantly thousands of times. But they will never beat bitcoin in privacy and trust.
@_date: 2017-02-15 11:50:00
WRONG. Bitcoins will stop being mined year ~2140 and the miners electricity will be payed for with only transaction fees. Bitcoin transactions become cheaper if you perform them offchain with something like lightning by which you reduce load on the miners. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 01:56:38
Look up P2SH - short for Pay to scripthash which also is a soft fork and there have not been any major problems with that. Even if you are afraid of the anyone can spend, you dont have to use segwit, there is still support for all the old opcodes.
@_date: 2015-01-27 13:34:12
It's almost correct, an address without outgoing transactions is protected by SHA256 and ECDSA, however if there is outgoing transactions the address is only protected by ECDSA. So if you break ECDSA you gain access to some coins. If you only break SHA256 you get access to 0 coins. Thats why you cold storage keys should never have touched the Internet.

Bitcoin unlimited, a forked version of core that want to hardfork to bigger blocksizes.
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:07:48
Mining reward for masternodes seems weird to me, Im to much a chicken to invest in anything but btc
@_date: 2015-01-27 02:26:25
One would need to find vulnerabilities in both SHA256 and ECDSA.
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:01:24
Why is that?

Nand has been used in SD cards.

It's distinct from USD in that it's not only politicians that can print money, everyone can theoretically run a miner.

It,s an extrapolation of what happens if you don't comply with law enforcement, if you don't comply you will probably first get fined, then if you don't pay up, police will arrest you. If you resist arrest you'll end up facing a gun, if you still resist you'll end up dead.

And then we need to learn how to sign a transaction with a pen to keep our key offline.

I only watched half of it, it was interesting but the sound qualify was awful. Do it with proper mics or do the interview inside where there is less birds and wind.
@_date: 2015-02-17 12:06:29
No one knows if bitcoin will succeed, anyone who claims that is delusional. That's why the general guideline is don't invest more then you're ready to lose.
@_date: 2013-10-09 19:13:25
Yes, bitcoins your are planning to keep for a long time should be kept in coldstorage such as a paper wallet.

@_date: 2013-09-21 01:07:46
What you need is a metric so you can compare the correctness of 2 Ledgers, thats why the mining in bitcoin works, you hash the block and you get the amount of zeros, the ledger with the most leading zeros is the most correct one. If you find a more energy efficent metric you deserve a nobel prize, so its just to get started :D
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:19:20
It was, he said so on stream.
@_date: 2013-09-23 17:59:24
Very cleshay indeed :)
But that dont seem like a very good analogy to me:
A needle in a hay stack is supposedly random, if you toss in the needle again and the next peer tries to confirm the haystack, the peer can't check at the same place and find the needle to also "unlock" the haystack.
It is correct in that it is hard but it dont really explain the function of mining or why it is important. Mining is the most important part of the system and that is what people need to be enlightened about.
Without mining, XBT is just another centralized digital currency and no one would give a damn.
@_date: 2013-09-23 18:13:14
Well bitcoin and mining actually is very hard to explain to a non techie, when I used terms like SHA256, ECC, Blockchain, people gets confused because they dont understand the pupose of each of the acronyms.

Honestly, I hope satoshi never reveals his identity. That way he will always be awesome :D
@_date: 2013-09-19 16:41:53
There is one problem I see with it, how does the client establish the inital ledger when connecting to a peer and if another peer publish another ledger, how do you know which one too choose?
