Is it slow and expensive across the board, or are the fees and speed tied to which currency your buying / selling?

Complete and utter newbie here. I've been reading through the wiki / FAQs and linked sites, let me know if I have this straight.
You buy BTC or any other AltCoin on an exchange like Coinbase, GDAX, BitStamp, etc and you can store / manage your coins...
* through these third party exchanges (not recommended)
* via a dedicated Wallet App like BreadWallet (slightly better)
* or get a Hard Wallet like Trezor or Ledger to store your coins &amp; use the app wallets for small amounts or when you need to move coins (recommended approach)
After that it's your decision whether you're storing as an investment or moving coins around more frequently for purchases, etc
I guess I have a couple questions:
* How easy is it to move coins from the exchange to your wallet app to your hard wallet and back?
* Can you just buy off the exchanges directly into your hard wallet and vice versa, or is the app middleman required?
* Can Wallet Apps / Hard Wallets all store the various types of altcoins outside of BTC, or only certain major ones? Does that ever change?
Edit: Additional Q: Does everyone need to install a Bitcoin client from bitcoin.org in order to get started and to sync wallets with the blockchain?

Gotcha, thanks!
Is one method more secure than the other? Do you risk exposing anything related to the Hard Wallet if you go directly there from the exchange?

Not that I don't appreciate the Reddit hivemind from time to time, but can someone recommend blogs / people to follow to stay up to date on crypto news and trends?
If I'm going to start investing here I'd rather get my information from the source.

Ah this is great, thank you! Definitely rounded out some existing knowledge I had. Much appreciated.
