Sorry friend too late for mining unless you mine Alts. May I suggest setting up a node. Being a node and participating in the ecosystem is a great way and one I think in the future could well be a source of income... Who knows. I loves me my BTC however some Alts will payoff I and others believe. Allow me to shill XLM. Thanks and best of luck!

Oh you and those graphs. Stop with data and research we don’t want that here. You can’t use actual data points to substantiate your claims that’s complete BS!!’ ( Sarcasam )

Damn I just had to buy another $1k worth - more of an emo buy and messed up my DCA but in light of next weeks BIG meet up in NYC and an expected Bull Run... regardless always a good time to buy - 10k next week I’m betting on it!

Yes, thanks so much!!! Cheers.

Dude who runs Bitmex said $50k end of the year - I like that better than 5k

Can someone who is like REALLY smart help out here... On the BTC futures that are listed on CFTC and what Goldman will soon be pushing... I take it that people who are buying these DO NOT actually OWN the keys or seed words correct? The banks / firms still do? If so I can see this being an issue move folks getting wiped out... NOT YOUR KEYS NOT YOUR CRYPTO. Am I wrong in this??? Thanks.

THANK YOU - This is my concern is that people will rush into buy "BTC" from traditional places but they are getting derivatives NOT the actual coin and don't own the keys. People will THINK they own some but NOPE. Could this then present a problem if let's say all those accounts get wiped out? What would happen say if there was a global economic downturn are those folks left holding ( NOT HODL ) the bag so to speak. I hope I'm making sense as I am still working on my 1st cup this am... Thanks again!

Oh wait the fawking trolls will post and claim FUD in 3,2,1....

And that is exactly what I did. Bought last year under 10k rode the pump sold off and moved into Alts and ETH. Sold off gains and now bought back my BTC at under $9k - Great deal. Now I will HODL and ride it for 2018
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:21:37
Yep wait until March! Spring and Summer 2018 ride the pump!
