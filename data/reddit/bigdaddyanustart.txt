Yeah but international trade is scary and bad and makes western dominance seem arbitrary and that's scary to a lot of people. So they retreat into ethnonationalism and blame rich people. 
Then they vote for billionaires who manufacturer their shitty hats in China, hires immigrants at his resorts and outsources his daughters clothes jobs to Asia. 
No big deal. Just smart, smart people making great decisions

My point is it's like saying "Crashing your car will kill you"
It can. It probably will if you're going fast enough. But there are ways to prevent it. Driving slowly. Wearing a seatbelt. Having airbags.
When asked "how did Jim die?" the answer would be "well he died in a car crash"
"Why did we print so much money? the answer would be "we had massive tax cuts for the rich"
But the conversation could be "he was in a car crash, how did he not die?" answer "he was wearing a seatbelt"
Similarly: "We had tax cuts and a surplus? how?"  answer "economic growth increased revenues"
You see? Just because something is the cause of something, doesn't mean one thing always causes it.

Tax cuts have nothing to do with monetary supply or inflation.
EDIT: Yes sure, in the long run they might be the reason the gov't decides to borrow more. But the Senate didn't just print more money last night. They simply reduced the federal revenues.
If the economy grows like Trump claims it will, revenue will soar and there will be a surplus.
This won't happen because Trump is a fucking liar and the gov't will print more money to pay for it like they always do.

I'm sorry you're having trouble accepting that these words mean the exact same thing and there is no functional difference between accepting fiat cash and accepting a physical good.
If you want to play semantic games like "selling is only when a good/service is exchanged for fiat cash" then ok. Have fun with that. It won't get you anywhere.
The sooner you realize that trading, exchanging, buying/selling are the same thing the better off you'll be. You're stuck in a linguistic, English-centric understanding. Some languages don't have separate words for those things.

I don't think the currency or value tracking system (fiat, bitcoin, sea shells etc) are necessarily connected to how we distribute wealth and economic opportunity. I think fiat and the banking system encourages greed and the evils associated with capitalism - but i see those problems have arisen in the bitcoin space x100. I'm not sure how bitcoin and socialism can, will or should work together.

ATMs at your bank are free and some banks reimburse fees from other banks. Small stores that have independent ATMs charge a fee because, guess what, they're providing a service.

I guess I'm confused. Isn't corporatism the inevitable result of capitalism? I fail to see how corporatism is a bug of capitalism and not an obvious, predictable and intended feature.
Why are corporations, who are currently treated as individuals and persons, not allowed to lobby the government and try to get beneficial policies in place? People do this, why shouldn't corporations be allowed to? Aren't corporations simply acting in their best interest within the law? 
 
Wouldn't restricting the power of businesses to lobby government trample over individual rights?

Yes. Wealth and hard work are completely directly 100% linearly related. Jeff Bezos has worked 137 billion times harder than you and me. His wealth is all his creation and nothing to do with the labor of his employees or the infrastructure of the nation built with public funds.
We shouldn't be taxing the wealthy because they totally earned it. Every penny. Similarly, we shouldn't be helping the poor because they simply don't work hard enough.

What good are property rights when you have no property? Is the problem really that the government is taxing poor people too much? 
Or do you think it's that massive amounts of wealth are being concentrated by corporations and private individuals and not being taxed - either because of tax loopholes or offshoring? That money is not being re-invested in the economy to help poor people, despite what Fox News and right wing libertarian propaganda are telling you.
Individualism is a myth giant corporations and rich fucks are selling you to keep us down - and you're falling for it and helping them sell it. They regularly cooperate, pool resources and receive government assistance. Why are we celebrating socialism for the rich but rugged individualism for the poor single working parent?

How about you learn to explain things better to people who are trying to take the time and learn from people who do understand these things? Instead of rattling off meaningless phrases like:


That is literally meaningless jargon and helps no one understand anything and you either 1) don't realize that or 2) do realize it and are getting off on acting smarter than your audience.

@_date: 2019-06-15 16:56:12
they are not but you're helping highlight my point. scarcity is meaningless in and of itself. utility is crucial too.
that's obviously a thornier issue for bitcoin enthusiasts to defend; is bitcoin useful?
not really. not to most people, right now. it really doesn't do much that conventional money doesn't - except explode and crash in value regularly. so as money - its flagship use - it's terrible.
this is why people's go-to argument is scarcity. It is undeniably scarce.
other important qualities like usefulness, ease-of-use, security and efficiency are debatably worse.
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:33:47

.......What exactly was I supposed to google...?
“How scarce are my turds?”
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:10:54
only to some - only in certain times. those things were not valuable when they were printed, despite being printed in limited, finite quantities i.e. scarce.
they develop value because they have qualities other than scarcity - artistic value, for instance. Their scarcity drives up the price (supply/demand) but it is not the reason people want them. 
This all circles back to my original comment : underlying intrinsic value is what gives things value, not scarcity. My turds are scarce (despite what idiots in this thread think) but that doesn't make them valuable.

This isn't some big secret. It's the elephant in the room bitcoiners don't want to acknowledge.
@_date: 2019-04-27 18:14:39
right...but as you'd know if you read the full BoR that "privacy" isn't explicitly mentioned. The concept of privacy rights has been coalesced from the combination of the 1st and 4th Amendments through Supreme Court cases over the centuries.
It is an inferred right that is open to interpretation and context. My challenge was meant to highlight that the US Constitution doesn't guarantee a "right to privacy" because it never uses the word "privacy".
This seems like it doesn't matter but it very much does. It means courts and legislators decide what level of privacy is acceptable in today's society.
Your original question was "Do you know why privacy is protected by the bill of rights?"
The answer is "strictly speaking, it isn't".
@_date: 2019-04-27 15:21:45
I mean, you do need to trust a third party: the entire mining network. It's unlikely that it's lying to you, but people forget that there are 3 entities involved in every bitcoin transaction: sender, receiver and miners.
Without the network - without the 3rd party - bitcoin doesn't exist.

@_date: 2019-04-27 15:31:59
That's not a counter point. In fact, that only proves my point. There is such a need and reliance on the bitcoin network  (3rd party) that bitcoin can't survive without it.
Now, please address my points that instant verification isn't a requisite for ownership.
To go on a tangent: I'd argue that possession isn't even a requisite for ownership. If your bitcoins are stolen, are they not yours any more? Do you have zero legal recourse in the admittedly unlikely event that you track down who stole them? Of course not. They are still yours. You are entitled to them despite not being in possession of them. Just like anything else that's stolen: cars, boats, dollars, jewelry, stock certificates....

no, mf, there most definitely is fraud and theft of both bitcoin and dollars all the time.

That doesn't make it less of a **property** - it simply means that verification is harder and more cumbersome.
If I buy a stock from a reputable 3rd party 99.999999% of the time, it's a legitimate stock. 
Are you under the impression that gold is not a property because, unless you're a metallurgist, you need to get someone else to verify the authenticity? And even then, you're relying on the calibration of your equipment.
If I have a vacation home in Costa Rica, is it not a property if I can't physically see it from my house in California? Is it only a property once I prove it is there with my own two eyes?
This logic is so fucking stupid.

Y'all have been hooking suckers with that shit for years. Let me know when it's 2000. I won't be holding my breath.
What so misleading about this nonsense is that the internet needed to be built, physically. That takes time. Bitcoin updates and software can be rolled out across the globe instantly. There's no reason the timeline should be as long as it is if it's so powerful. Anyone with the internet can "get into" bitcoin but, newsflash, no one cares about bitcoin because it doesn't solve any problems for 99.9999% of people and only introduces many many more.

Market cap isn’t a thing for bitcoin. Stop using that phrase. It makes no sense.
@_date: 2019-05-04 00:13:26
Crazy to think there are people in the bitcoin space that don’t know precisely who this is.
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:07:44
Is it though? USD is "tied" to a great many things. You can buy and pay for orders of magnitude more things with it - literally everything. You pay your taxes with it. Your employer pays you with it. It is the most commonly accepted form of credit/currency in the world. In a sense, it is tied to the economy. 
And in this sense, bitcoin is not. The world economy would chug along and never notice if bitcoin ceased to exist. No legitimate businesses outside of the direct bitcoin sphere (i.e. Coinbase etc) would go under if bitcoin went kaput.
This is a sexy soundbite, but ultimately it's pretty shallow.

So you concede missing money and not being able to track your finances effectively are two completely different things, right?
so it's not semantics. its apples and oranges and you guys have taken this clip out of context, put on your nutjob hats and pretended he said something he didn't. good job.

Why? If TA is right/correct/true there should be someone out there I should be able to listen to and they should be able to guide me. If TA is true it should be independent of who is saying it.  It shouldn’t be something I have to figure out myself. 
Said another way, I should be able to do TA and tell you when to buy and sell accurately without you having to understand TA at all.
In the same way that you don’t need to understand how electricity works to turn on a lightbulb. 
So tell me. Who does TA correctly? Who is always right? Who should I listen to because someone has to be right if TA is right. 
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:35:14
I agree, I am shifting the goalposts, but the goalposts were never there to begin with. I used "tied" in quotes because i agree that neither the dollar nor bitcoin are literally tied to anything specific.
My point was that, for the dollar, the closest concept to being "tied" to anything is its ubiquity of use.
The same cannot be said of bitcoin. I know you think bitcoin is tied to the digital economy but it really isn't. Ultimately the digital economy runs on dollars. Present tense.

I think we can all agree the "male" aspect of the euphemism isn't the important part. The bear/bull monikers are derived from their shapes. Male bison and male domestic cattle are basically the same thing, in the grand scheme of things. 
Thus, a male shark - even though we call them bulls - wouldn't be appropriate.

Donal Rumsfeld is literally pointing out that innefficiency. The whole reason of this presser was to say "look, we have an extremely outdated system to track this money. we need a better system."
**He's literally agreeing with you.**
You don't know that because this video is intentionally misleading and shortened. It shows nothing he said before it or after for the purpose of tricking dumb gullible people (cough you) on the internet.
@_date: 2019-05-27 14:57:30
You're just not getting it huh....
**The money is not and never was missing.**
They were unable to track the money effectively because of outdated accounting procedures and software. 
THE END. Stop spreading lies or at least admit you know they're lies. Stop pretending to know the truth when you clearly don't.

If TA works, why do some predictions say buy, and some say sell, given the same access to information?
Why isn’t there 1 correct answer at every given moment? Why is r/bitcoinmarkets full of conflicting TA? Which one is right?

How are they different? You keep saying they are different but present no indication as to why?
What is the practical difference and how does it relate to the question of whether or not  Coinbase should ban purveyors of awful right wing bullshit?
Actually, you know what? I don’t care if they’re different. It has no impact on the topic at hand. This is what y’all always do. Drill down on irrelevant semantic rabbit holes to avoid answering questions posed to you.

2) yes. That’s what I’m saying. It’s what Donald Rumsfeld was saying too.

I understand that Ford didn't create the automobile, thanks. My point is that he had a *vested interest* in seeing automobiles take off, whether or not the idea had legs.
Clearly he was right, but history is FULL of people hyping shit that never took off. Thanks for the feel-good examples you keep throwing out for no reason but it doesn't change a thing. Like I said, I can throw the same amount, if not more, counter examples. Ever heard of Theranos?
A hedge fund manager should be viewed with an INCREDIBLY skeptical eye when he's promoting his own asset. To do anything else is moronic.
