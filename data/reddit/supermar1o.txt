Sorry about your brother, but goodness, you guys are depressing =/ we all say "what if" but its absolutely no reason to live your life depressed or commit suicide. I was big into bitcoin for about a month immediately after it came out, I am sure somewhere on a wallet I have long since deleted and lost I have a crap ton of bitcoin , but it's gone. Oh well, we move on. I have 0.5 right now and enjoy watching it rise, but I am not obsessing over what I could of had...
