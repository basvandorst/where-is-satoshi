this is why most regular folk won't take or touch bitcoin yet. too wild.

hot potato. people are finally figuring that out

They are huge when it comes to setting standards for international banking and currencies. Now, Bitcoin lobbyists (and there are many!) can say to any government - you oughta allow bitcoin trading and transactions, heck the Swiss are doing it. And it'd be a strong argument.

Why not? eBay owns PayPal, and PayPal's hegemony over electronic payments around the world is threatened by Bitcoin. Why use PayPal if we all have Bitcoin?

Not when it comes to people's money. If folks are outta dough, governments are gonna either abandon it or find a way to regulate/control it.

eBay's PayPal has been purposely shunning Bitcoin, banning sale of Bitcoin related computer equipment, etc. Now it all makes sense....

unless they start making jewellery out of bitcoin gold ain't goin away. no-one ever got laid giving his girlfriend some bitcoin

Swiss are usually old and stodgy, esp when it comes to their banking rules. So this is kinda a big deal, credibility-wise for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-13 13:07:47
this is exactly why big banks want nothing to do with cryptocurrency. it'll eat away at their big fat bank fees.

momentum. no tax. real use. This is the trifecta folks, Bitcoin is on the rise.

looks like it might happen sooner rather than later!

hard to time something like this. but if bitcoin uptake continues among retailers and in the 'real world', and with limited supply of Bitcoin built-in, this is an easy call that it'll hit $1K sometime soon. if it fails in the real world then it ain't worth a thing.

We'll know in time. I have a feeling that this time is different tho. I don't believe that Bitcoins have settled into their 'real' value yet, but they do have real value. Gonna be a roller coaster ride for a while still.....

A smart man once said (Casey Stubbs, actually): What’s another name for a long term investment? An unsuccessful short term investment! Welcome to the world of Bitcoin :-)

just confirms that 99% of the Dutch are stoned

Bitcoin needs to be used more in the 'real world' for it to become more established. And if it keeps going up everyone is going to hoard it, not spend it. I agree, this is a good thing!

As a smart man once said, "What’s another name for a long term investment? An unsuccessful short term investment!" Welcome to the world of Bitcoin!

You're missing the POLITICAL point here, people. The main issue here is China vs Japan, not China vs Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a JAPANESE invention and is still essentially controlled by Japanese hackers. Chinese authorities don't like that, there's a lot of tension now between China and Japan.

Go take Bitcoin Snoop!

I think the point here is that Governments are indeed paying attention to Bitcoin. In this case, taking steps to encourage more Bitcoin activity in their country. Sure, they might turn tail later and start taxing Bitcoin activity again. But for the time being its Bitcoin tax holiday time in Korea!
