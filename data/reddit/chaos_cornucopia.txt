I am looking into this. Thanks for the reply.

Thanks. I live in the boonies where most people have never heard of BC. Closest seller listed on that site is 110 miles away, but I'll keep an eye on it  to see if something closer pops up.

Thanks for reply. I live in the middle of nowhere Texas, so there isn't one within 170 miles of me apparently. I didn't know ATM's existed for bitcoin though. That's pretty interesting.

Alright, I'll look into it tomorrow. Thanks for the heads up.

Already proven wrong in this thread by everyone but you who commented. You can stop now.

Does not work through phone, because verification from old number is required, even to log in to phone app. I have tablets but im not linking them to my accounts since I have kids on them and they just aren't secure. Im just going to buy a camera  then throw it out I guess.

Tons of people. Thanks for the non help though. I bet you are as proud of your aol email address as you are that phone number.

I didn't know he had fans. Not sure which of you is more pathetic.

Thanks. Finally an adult response (Not that I didnt expect idiotic reactions here). I just couldn't fathom why that would be required, considering a webcam image seems like the worst security measure imaginable. Im not worried about the price I just didn't feel like having to go get one and have one hooked up to my pc as they are obviously a security threat, but I guess Ill just go buy one and toss it in the closet when I'm done if there really is no way around it.
Cheers
