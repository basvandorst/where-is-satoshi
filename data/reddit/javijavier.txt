ALWAYS check your seed or private key recovering it minimun a couple times! ALWAYS in an offline computer.
Have fun in Bitcoinland! :)

I signed up 4 years ago just to have an account, I never used it. I added my credit card in June 2017, at first time I had the 500 limit and then 12/6/17 (December, 6) the limit was increased (I dind't do nothing). They comunicated it via email. I checked this right now.

Paper Wallet.

Always create the seed in offline machine... You can use a raspberry pi zero just to do this... $5 cold wallet! you can sign transaction offline y then propagate the tx in another computer. NO RISKS!!

Yes, fees fuck us... We need LN...

If you never write your Private key or Seed in a online computer your coins will be SAFE. If anytime you use it (privatekey or seed) you can create a new wallet (offline) and send the reaming coins there.

And why you'll keep your fiat/crypto in the exchange?
Any exchange can desapear in any moment (or be hacked).

Cold Wallet. Ledger nano S if you want a hardware wallet or paperwallet if you prefer the cheaper option.

This fees are normal these days in bitcoin. 
You can see it: [

You can just search your public key in any blockachain explorer (blockchain.info -example-). You will see your balance.

You just can create a seed in Electrum (offline computer). Copy the seed and remember the generated address. Delete the wallet and try recover the seed, you can do that a couple times. If it works you can send the coins to this address and recover it wherever you want using the seed.
Another easy way is copy [ webpage in a pendrive and run it in a browser (offline computer). Generate a couple adresses. Try to recover. You can print it. Send the coins to this address. Recover when you want.

Cold wallet and HODL three years!!
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:43:16

@_date: 2017-12-11 12:48:37
I don't know how the limits works... Sorry.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:22:51
I run my own node too from five years... I'm still hodling!
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:34:43
Technically, yes. You don't pay taxes. 
But please! don't keep your money or coins in exchanges (this is just an advise).
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:56:33
I run it at home...
