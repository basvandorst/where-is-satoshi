Holy shit I went through all comments first because that's what I always do when I believe the video may be really disturbing. But I felt like something was off, as if everyone was just joking or something. So I had to look, and it starts out clean but... Now I can't sleep and I've already thrown up twice. I've never seen a ball roll like that before.

Justin, hire someone cheap to **categorize all the issues** into **problem type** and **amount of money involved**. Any kid can read ticket descriptions and make this estimation.
Then **use that as prioritization** to get the most important issues solved.
If **users are having hundreds of thousands of dollars locked up for months**, I'm sure **you're resolving the tickets in the wrong order**. Especially considering you're able to jump into this thread and solve them immediately.

They specifically warn against `&lt;completely reasonable thing to do&gt;` so it's an user error. Not very user friendly then is it?

Sorry didn't mean that, was just annoyed with Kraken

There was some talk about GDAX covering up spikes in their graphs recently:
I remember some other thread as well but can't find it right now.
So here's my theory.
To cover that up, they needed to switch from dynamically calculating the candles for *any* granularity, to instead having very few allowed granularities for which they could preprocess/cache the results. This allows them to manipulate the cache afterwards.
I remember some thread where someone saw parts of a graph gradually being covered up, piece by piece. This is how they did it.
Some conspiracy material right I know.
Any updates on your side? Still see incorrect results in the API?

$250B was not moved into bank accounts. Nobody knows the number, it could be $1 or even negative as well since the market cap (which dropped by $250B) is only based on the last traded price, not how much money has been put into the system.

How come the Android solution doesn't require you to set up a full node? What's the difference?

Ok thanks. How easy will it be in the future? Will I be able to use some wallet software on my phone and click a button to open a channel?

Noob q: does time between blocks increase on average when the difficulty is increased? Does that decrease the tps?
