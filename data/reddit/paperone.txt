It's that way since days. There's a HUGE GAP
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:17:48
did you trade on Kraken? look I've it in front of my eyes now!
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:27:34
on two different pcs? look I'm wrapping my head around this as well. I'd be happy to know that it's something related to my pc but I'm logged in. It's priced like that in every page and interface meaning both trade.kraken.com AND kraken.com
Did you log in?
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:18:50
yeah 1000$ glitch! :-D who wants to buy or go long have a huge chance on kraken now
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:25:50
In some places is falling more than in others. Check this out.

it's not weird to see difference in prices among exchanges. I've been doing some researches weeks ago and it is totally possible to have differences between exchanges. However I don't understand how come USD=EUR!!
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:51:28
WOW it's back to normal now. I see the right values and I DID NOT TOUCH ANYTHING. I can't explain this.  
However I've now reasons to believe that it was a browser glitch or something. Wow, I still can't believe it.
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:57:11
yeah!! exactly! that's the part I don't understand. However it's a good chance for some who could buy BTC on kraken and sell it anywhere else. 
See yourself

hard to say about volatility ... I've been reading this today [ If it's true that such a huge value per btc will happen then it's hard to believe that the result will be achieved in a linear way: there is too much trading potential. What do you think?
@_date: 2018-07-08 01:32:07
you are my hero, thank you so much. Now I feel sorry that this conversation didn't happen on steemit ...   
I'm looking at the "valley chart" (does it have a proper name?). I zoomed in and I see 1 main green line and 1 main red line but there are also 2 other thin green and red lines. What are they for?

FYI I've asked the same question also on [bitcointalk forum]( and I've got a very interesting answer
@_date: 2018-07-07 13:29:33
you are right. I'm definitely shamefully ignorant and not just in the crypto / finance world. That's why I'm here asking questions and spending all the time I can reading about it. What else can I do? Please tell me and I'll do
@_date: 2018-07-07 00:00:47
thank you! I see it. Now it's about understanding it since I don't get it :-)  I'll try later on, I need some rest. If you don't mind I'll message you if I can't succeed
@_date: 2018-07-07 00:03:16
yes I understand what you mean but the exchange must have a method to output the current price, right? How does it work?
@_date: 2018-07-10 01:08:10
it says SBERBANK electronic payment
@_date: 2018-07-06 16:45:12
why is this filed under r/Bitcoin ?
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:45:35
I understand better now. So the "volume" for each order influences how quickly the price will change, right? because orders must be "eaten" or fulfilled, correct?
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:47:45
now, now ... I've spent quite an amount of time on this chart: it's freaking amazing !!! thank you SO much.  
@_date: 2018-07-06 20:35:53
oh! shit! got it now! lol, I focused on the coin and didn't the QRcode!! Bed time I guess :-D
@_date: 2018-07-08 02:28:09
*It can be fun to watch the depth chart change as the price starts moving ...* that's what I'm trying to do (still with little success but I'll keep doing)  
how on earth did you spot the WTF? I totally missed it!
