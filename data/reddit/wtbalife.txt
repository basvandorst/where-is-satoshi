But restriction of trade is illegal, silly troll.

Every payment co blocking a company for free speech is a violation and abuse as far as I'm concerned.

Only the rich may win a lawsuit. Ah the joys of America where only the J and other elite may sue.
Free speech lovers are never among the elite.
Why am I arguing with a troll who joined a few days ago and was probably banned? Lol.

Once again there is ever more proof that the 1st needs to apply to corporations and not just the government.
Free speech is dead and has been for years now.

Stick it where the sun doesn't shine, communist. There is no excuse for businesses crippling other businesses. If it's not already illegal, it should be.

Hello, government bot/astroturfer.
You are the traitor. Snowden and Assange are the only modern heros in the truest sense.

It's still illegal but not enforced. 
Every complicit bank, mobile platform, and crypto exchange should have all its employees sent to Guantanamo for life.

When traitors run your government and call YOU the traitor, you have no choice but to hide.

Found the "leftist" who wants to turn the USA into China where free speech gets you killed.

But killing free speech is not the will of America, the land of the no longer free.

Being blocked from hosting free speech is functionally the same. Unconstitutional abuse by payment cos.

Class action lawsuits pay the lawyers, not the defendants, though, so they're as good as worthless anyway.
America's legal system is garbage and neither the far left or right want to fix it. The fact you support companies banning free speech shows you're just as bad.
I'm just more than a bit pissed that even crypto is infested with scummy bankers and authoritards. All the downsides of crypto, plus you're still not guaranteed any "privacy" or "free speech". Might as well just invest in gold, oh wait, you'd get killed and robbed like Gaddafi.

How would you feel if Google conspired to make sure ChromeOS and Android are the only operating systems you could use, by starving out the competition like liberals are doing to Gab and Wikileaks?
Practically apples to apples comparison, ChromeOS is just about the worst OS just as Discord, Twitter FB etc are all terrible..and comes with privacy/rights concerns just as they do.
The only difference in that scenario is that ChromeOS would become an illegal monopoly rather than "just a free and legal speech violation".
In order to have free speech you must accept "icky speech" and "speech you don't like" or YOUR SPEECH IS NEXT TO BE LOST.
