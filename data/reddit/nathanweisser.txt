I've been trying to market cap a blockchain for years bro
@_date: 2019-07-09 14:58:10
Some really high level discussion going on here guys

HISTORY IN THE MAKING
@_date: 2019-07-11 01:18:11
This is just economically illiterate, though. A corporation has absolutely no vested interest in using a currency that's separate from the people.
Sure, maybe corporations will try and make cryptos, but they will *always* take the currency the people prefer, because you know, profits?
Read a dang book, guys.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:00:35
Wait, so we're looking to the financial institutions to fix the problem? Doesn't that go against everything we're standing for??
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:05:33
I read through what you linked, too. Thanks for your explanation.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:25:51
Would you consider the segwit system to be something that's decentralized?
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:39:16
Well, I don't know. I'm just trying to understand it
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:01:10
I can't find anything through searching the video title thanks to all the shitposting lol
@_date: 2018-09-05 05:39:03
Wow the rare useful and decent post on this sub. Nice!
@_date: 2018-08-25 19:43:29
Oh, yeah, sorry. *Printing money to fund subsidies to make a fake low healthcare price
@_date: 2018-08-27 14:41:39
It's a smiley face lol
@_date: 2018-08-25 18:16:35
Well with true crypto adoption other countries won't be printing the money to fund their fake free healthcare
@_date: 2018-08-26 03:46:17


Ok, Austrian, Chicago, Vienna, Keynesian, or Marx? Bc if it's anything other than Marx, I'm right lol
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:57:31
Gotta make it clickable yo

"Bitcoin is made to be used as a currency, not a store of value"
Can you say that again for those in the back please
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:21:55
r/Bitcoin literally like 6 months ago:
NEVER use Coinbase. NEVER. THEY ARE *SATAN*.
r/Bitcoin today:
Coinbase is neat!
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:04:51
Basically, blockstream as a company really worries me. I want something completely decentralized, not where each transaction goes through a SegWit type system of IOUs.
@_date: 2019-11-07 12:28:20
We seasteading now boys
@_date: 2019-08-21 21:39:22
What if I want it to be better than gold?
@_date: 2018-06-08 18:13:01
YEEEAAAHH FREE MARKET BABYYYY

Andreas putting his credibility on one of the worst bets in crypto history
@_date: 2019-10-01 02:27:13
Dozens! Dozens of them!
@_date: 2019-06-18 14:50:42
Nor does it have a subreddit
@_date: 2019-02-02 16:33:10
Great! Jack Dorsey is still a bumbling dunderhead.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:04:27
Ok, cool, but there's no point in belittling people for backing a fork.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:09:08
It's the more efficient coin lol.
@_date: 2019-12-26 19:42:22
LBRY sounds cool
@_date: 2019-04-28 15:35:38
Dash is actually putting in some work believe it or not. Lots of people using it.
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:41:28
You can sue Blockstream
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:03:52
I'm really actually mostly invested in ethereum, but speculatively in  privacy coins and coins that challenge blockchain as a technology.
@_date: 2018-11-04 22:01:21
HA - like Poloniex will still be a thing
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:52:47
Not really Bitcoin, though, other than that most people mine alts and transfer them to btc
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:24:33
Because the people in charge don't even want it to be considered a currency anymore.
@_date: 2018-11-01 16:52:33


@_date: 2018-03-08 14:47:04
I thought this minicrash was because of the Binance FUD tbh
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:00:53
It's not us vs them, we gotta destroy that mental-HEY LOOK THERE'S MORE NODES HAHHAHA
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:22:19
Please, no, let's not talk about regulating exchanges. This is completely counter to what Bitcoin is supposed to be doing to government interference in commerce.
@_date: 2019-01-12 14:54:35
People hate bsv for other reasons, and they acknowledge that the code isn't ready for 128. You're talking out of your butt.
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:42:42
Shouldn't the tech speak for itself?
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:43:21
underrated comment
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:13:39
Well then dang we gotta stop losing LN nodes lol
@_date: 2018-03-31 12:53:38
Or you could spend it like a currency and not a stock
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:40:29
Bitcoin - the slowest, most inefficient coin in all of crypto - is celebrating the death of it's natural evolution thanks to public FUD
@_date: 2018-03-13 17:01:41
Yeah, I plan to use them as a currency. No need to sell them. Because it's not a trading game.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:38:34
People who think the only thing Bitcoin Cash does is "try to sell Bitcoin at a cheaper price" are severely misinformed or they just don't know the differences between a 1mb blockchain and an 8mb one
@_date: 2019-09-30 11:52:18
Yeah instead of paying 3¢, you pay $20 worth of your own time to get the transaction running lmao
@_date: 2019-09-30 11:46:36
It should be far less than a penny.
@_date: 2018-07-30 23:07:22
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:04:06
New Hampshire is ranked the most Libertarian state in the union. Makes sense this would happen there.
Edit: also Bitcoin Cash sticker present, so this isn't allowed to be upvoted here
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:15:44
Or this community could just stop making themselves look bad by constantly hating on one dude. The more you obsess over this dude, the more legitimacy you grant him in the public eye
@_date: 2019-09-30 11:50:19
Nano is now verifiably decentralized as of late, just fyi
@_date: 2018-07-26 14:08:45
Yeah, and Bitcoin.org removes providers that *do* support BCH. And?
@_date: 2018-07-29 22:01:32
Just poking fun at this sub, not being serious.
@_date: 2019-09-30 13:03:54
"WOAH LOOK THE FEE IS $.0000001"
*waiting for confirmation*
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:49:45
That just means more paid Reddit posts. Ugfhh
@_date: 2019-09-30 11:50:56
I mean it's easy to say when no one is using the network. Is that the future you want? For Bitcoin to never be used?
@_date: 2018-07-26 14:11:16
He's already offered $500,000 USD to theymos if they would allow him to have an uncensored AMA on this sub, but they've refused.
@_date: 2018-07-26 14:09:43
psst: LN hubs
@_date: 2018-07-18 14:04:55
There are 1 million of you and only 90 comments, because when people get banned, the subscriber count doesn't go down, but they can still comment. They're all banned.
@_date: 2018-04-07 23:44:32
haha dum creg
@_date: 2018-04-13 02:42:23
Wait so you're saying it's not a store of value?
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:08:59
What is your opinion on the Bitgrail insolvency and Francesco "Bomber" Firano?
@_date: 2018-04-08 15:18:18
- all of them by 2020, though. For sure by 2020.
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:11:47
Lol CALL UNIVERSAL, I HAVE A PITCH
@_date: 2019-05-19 09:44:20
That's the fed
@_date: 2019-05-24 01:49:29
Lemonade only $1!
*Pays $8 in BTC*
@_date: 2019-05-19 01:16:46
Almost like our whole purpose here is subverting the fed lol
@_date: 2019-05-19 11:48:32
Why?
