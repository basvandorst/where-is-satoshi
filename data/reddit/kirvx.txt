There is a simple solution to decrease the need of a mining pool (and centralization) and create more independent miner:
Increase the frequency of the block reward.
From 10 minutes to 1 minute (and divide the amount by 10).
It also has the advantage to decrease the confirmation time.
@_date: 2015-12-23 08:56:52
Thanks for your answer :)
Anyway, we're very fortunate to have you in the Bitcoin project, especially for Lightning  :)
@_date: 2015-12-27 00:24:53
I'm still surprised that very important business like Coinbase, BitPay, 21 Inc, Xapo and miners do not intervene in the dev of Bitcoin Core.
Just with them we could have maybe 20-50 guys dedicated to Bitcoin Core.
Conflict of interest you tell me? Look Blockstream.
Where is the real consensus if no one participate?

It would be acceptable with block compression like IBLT.
Otherwise it is not enough, except a jump to 4MB instead of 2.

Rusty......... why a fee market at this stage? WTF?
Are we waiting for a fee of $1 per transaction to increase the size of the blocks?
Miners DON'T CARE about fees for  this decade.
Fee market should ONLY exist if Bitcoin goes mainstream, not when it's a baby!
Give you a tenth of a bottle of milk to a baby?
@_date: 2015-12-22 23:12:52
Sorry Rusty, it's just frustrating to see every guys of Blockstream refusing an increase of the block size, or demonstrating why it doesn't need an increase. Especially with the power that Blockstream has on Bitcoin Core, and because you are one of the last hired, and I admit that I thought (for real) maybe this awesome guy has a different idea of the other guys about the block size, maybe a new hope for the community...
It seems so logical for many persons to increase the size of the blocks... 1MB each 10 minutes in 2016...

Nobody know Bitcoin and it cost already more than 3 cents to be confirmed in the next block. And Bitcoin is currently used for its currency, not for the blockchain technology. Maybe 100$ per transaction is very optimistic for the next decade with 1MB block.

I think core devs must realize that, apart some of them, everyone is OK to increase the size of the blocks: Miners, industries, and devs of SPV wallet.
No conflict exists on an increase of 2MB.
The fear of a hard fork is completely exaggerated and becomes increasingly unjustified.
So yes, if some refuse while the majority wants, bitcoin is centralized.

Lot of people think the bitcoin bubble is over because of the price of 237$, the graph and no more big variations.
I think if Bitcoin reach 400$ (or 300$), people will finaly consider Bitcoin as a real thing because it survived to the bubble phase (and become credible).
It means more business, more applications, more speculation and more adoption.
EDIT: 237$ not 215$ sorry

@_date: 2015-05-11 08:35:15
It also means that the difficulty retarget will be adjusted every 1.4 day instead of 14.
It is beneficial for miners right?
@_date: 2015-05-29 14:10:33
I will repeat what I said about the urgency to have bigger block:
  
This graph is actually very optimistic compared to the price chart configuration:
  
It's me or we see a recovery or at least a very healthy position?
To be clear: If Bitcoin jump to 400$ for any reason -&gt; It's over, 1MB is reached in a few weeks.
Same result for several good news (as currently).
If we reach the limit of 1MB (with all the problems of that) I can guess the titles in the press:
"Bitcoin no longer works"
"Transaction costs are exploding"
We don't have time to setup long-term solutions, and Gavin knows it.

Personally, I want to unlock the capabilities of the blockchain with blocks of 20MB, for more applications for users and businesses.
I don't want a blockchain reserved by those who are ready to pay several hundred dollars per transaction to use a revolutionary system.
Off chain transactions, a solution with 1MB block?
In the future, and if Bitcoin is becoming very popular, you will pay a lot to extract your "real" bitcoins of Changetip or Coinbase.
And you will have no benefits in transferring "bitcoins" to other users of the off chain service than using standard means of payment.
Bitcoin, as it is today, will not exist for users, only for large entities.
Here is the promise of 1MB block if Bitcoin succeeds.

And note that 20MB block is a maximum!
In the short term, blocks will probably be lower than 5MB.
It is the most elegant, logical, and simplest solution.

Right, but we have to figure out that we are in a renewal period of ASICs with 16nm chipset, which mean we have much more blocks than the normal production, so less transactions per block and less fees.
In a few months the hashrate (63% increase in less than 2 month) will stabilize, with less blocks, and Bitcoin will be even more popular.

By ratings was the most logical choice, but for example Bitcoin Wallet by Andreas Schildbach would have been the last of the list, and it does not make sense.
Before that, I wanted to list open source application first, and Mycelium was the first, but it completely left aside closes source apps and it was not fair because they offers good experiences and are especially effective to buy bitcoins. So maybe by number of downloads then ? Apple Store hide it.
So randomly? I think the classification must have a meaning.
So number of reviews is the one I found...
I know it benefits the big compagnies, but they have a lot of red for the first columns, I hope that the user will use its judgment.
For the others technical details, I do not want to make it too complicated but add NFC is a good idea.
I consider the card payment very important... it's the most easy way and lot of people have credit card.
You could add a SPV mode, disabled by default, and you win the green check mark (and it makes a big visual difference in this table for the position of Mycelium) :)
Also Mycelium is very complicated to translate for me, too many things, no context, you should hire pros.
Anyway, I must consider evolutions.
@_date: 2016-01-29 12:44:45
I think people want to use Bitcoin, not watch it as a technology only used by big companies, for big compagnies.
People want to see Bitcoin in the street, in their stores.
We know that Lightning needs biger blocks, and 2MB hard fork is clearly not destructive for the network and decentralization.
Also, Bitcoin risks to hard fork in the futur for a much more important reason than currently.
It would be a shame to not experience a hard fork before this time.

Seriously Greg, why not offer this compromise of a 2MB hard fork?
If you do that, EVERYONE will follow and hard fork will take place in the most secure conditions.
It is more a whim to refuse it than to accept it with the present situation.
Bitcoin Core should be exemplary, and should satisfy users, compagnies and miners. This is not the case at all.

I was the main french translator for the Coinbase website (50% by me, other by pro).
They blocked me 2 months ago (while keeping my translations) because they hired pro translators.
Today the french version has not been updated since they kicked me and the translation is very incomplete and has errors that I can't change.
 (a manager of the Coinbase project) said me I will be a proofreader when the pro translators have completed the verification of the existing translations -&gt; The job is done since 1 month at least, and nothing since that.

You're perfectly right.
Bitcoin is not a scam for sure, but every bitcoiner should warn people about the risk of investing during a spectacular rise.
A lot of people buy bitcoins because of this rise, they don't care about bitcoin, they want to sell it at a higher value. Currently, in the media, bitcoin is exclusively seen as an investissement.
There is 0 warning because everyone wins money at this moment.
Nobody seems realizes how fragile the price of a bitcoin is with a 900% rise pumped by a single exchange.

2 things:
- Nobody can't prevent hard fork. Bitcoin is designed to have hard forks if necessary, for bad or good reasons.
- Network fees is a huge expense for the companies in the NYA list.
Unbelievable that no one takes time to listen the services that promote Bitcoin and allow new users to buy it.
A hard fork should have been planned years ago, and each time, it's was the same thing from Core devs "hard forks take time to be adopted, so no hard forks and it's not necessary".
It will probably the same for quantum attacks, Core team will wait for an effective attack before planning something.
Hard fork is a taboo topic, no one can talk about it without being taken for a madman who wants to destroy bitcoin.
Therefore, I fully understand the attitude of the people who signed the NYA.
