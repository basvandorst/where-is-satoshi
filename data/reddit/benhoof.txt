On the one hand you think the government is so corrupt that they will lock up your assets out of pure whim. On the other hand that they are lawfull enough to require proof to put you in jail.

Buying bitcoin means nothing for adoption.
If you want to push Bitcoin adoption you have to accept bitcoin as payment.

But Bitcoin is mathematically secure, there can be no theft.

A centralized solution is always
* cheaper to maintain
* algorithmically simpler
* easier to modify
than a distributed system.
If it's better depends on the environment.

It can, but it won't
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:32:35
Claiming that X "is an important key to" Y also changes nothing.
I don't see how blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in any way hinder corruption and arbitrariness. Bitcoin for example is a big facilitator of corruption an illegal behavior.

Bitcoin is in no way democratic. It's a plutocracy.
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:41:24
But that's not what we are talking about. We are talking about corrupt governments. How does bitcoin helps dealing with a corrupt government?

Wow a whole article from someone who does not know what offline means...
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:18:58
Yeah right. For a wallet containing 100 $...
Seriously security affine people often overlook that for most applications the suggested security measures are overblown.
Would you store a 100 dollar bill in a safe instead of your wallet?

It is logical that there is more debt than money in circulation, because all money is debt, but not all debt is money.
There must be debt for money to make sense in the first place.

Meanwhile I'm hodling money in my Bank account since last december and made more than 100% profit in BTC.

Up next: Bitcoin could replace cash next week.
@_date: 2018-05-03 05:25:35
It would require a hard fork though as old nodes would not accept the increased block reward.
However, its true that the average user of bitcoin has very little say in this and it will only become worse the more bitcoin is adopted.

Your post is interesting because you do provide a somewhat more realistic view on crypto, banks and governmental institutions than is usually the case on reddit.
I don't have to trust you just to enjoy your narrative. And you don't give a lot of advise in the first place.
But why would you waste your time posting on reddit?!
Possible answers:
a) You're bored as hell, like me.
b) You're part of the illuminati conspiracy.

Yes and more importantly, he has to trust you that you do not race to the bank and withdraw the money before him.

This post makes too much sense to be taken seriously.

The egalitarian principle is that every *person* should have the same opportunity.
You can not deny that people with more wealth have more oportunity to acquire bitcoins.
By your definition he banking sector is also equal oportunity because in theory anyone can found a bank.

Well they were right, because it's decades later now.
And my grandma is still not using computers.

First of all the question was about "something" not especially cryptocurrencies.
And even in cryptocurrencies: A centralized system is just a special case of a distributed system with only one active node. So it's easy to see that a distributed system with N nodes requires at least N-times the maintainance costs than a centralized system.
@_date: 2018-05-27 10:14:51
So what about skipping s line by being stronger then everyone else? Is that immoral?

Node count means nothing. How many transaction per second is LN currently supporting?
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:31:11


Ok, I'll give you that.




Hahaha! Big NOPE.
@_date: 2018-06-06 09:26:42
He's totally right though.
As long as a significant number of merchants/service providers don't accept bitcoin and prices in crypto are not reasonably stable, there will never be a mass adoption of crypto.
Not likely, that this is ever going to ever happen though. As it currently stands, it's just a big bubble with no substantial value behind it.

Technology will not solve the energy consumption problem, because given a more efficient technology miner will just deploy more hardware.
The only way to reduce energy consumption of bitcoin is by reducing the reward miners get, so that they can not afford to spend as much energy per block as they currently do.
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:27:50
Replace by fee has nothing to do with double spend.
@_date: 2018-06-06 09:10:31
Your tinfoil had should tell you that all the news about new crypto investors and crypto stock exchanges are mostly bullshit.
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:35:18
Totally agree. That's why there will never be mass-adoption of Bitcoin.
At least in the sense of millions of people using Bitcoin on a daily basis.

The article explicitly states that VAT is applied to the price in BitCoin.
What is not applied to the sale in germany is capital gains tax.

No YOU can't be your own bank.
Without sufficient mining power you are as dependent on the miners as Fiat users are depending banks to keep the system going.
Controling the BlockChain means controlling BitCoin. And getting control over the BlockChain is just a matter of resources... which YOU do not have.
@_date: 2018-02-28 10:38:40
How is BitCoin immune to centralization? We are already seeing the BitCoin network being more and more centralized.
Just because the technology supports decentralization does not mean that systems using the technology are decentralized.
As a consequence, how is BitCoin immune to corruption?

Cash transactions are only anonymous in theory.
In practice the number of entities handling bills in between banks is very close to two.
So if banks register the identity of the person withdrawing and depositing a bill with a given registry number. The probability that these two persons were engaged in a direct cash transaction is very close to 100%.

In theory miners can stop you from sending bitcoins by not including your transaction in the blocks

If your definition of "works just fine" is equivalent to "doing what it is doing" then everything "works just fine".
In it's current state it's possible for big players to push small users completely off the block chain. How does this help improving the usability of the system for the majority of the population?

Because you can not measure which parts of which transactions are part of a deal for exchange of goods and services.

The byzantine generals problem is about something completely different. It's about how collaborating equals can come to a decision in an error prone environment.
The question at hand is more like "Do you trust the generals?" and "How do you prevent a general from becoming to powerfull?".
Bitcoin has not technical solution for this. You have to trust the network.
You said it yourself: You have to trust the network.
The only trust requirement Bitcoin eliminates is between the two parties of a transaction. If the transaction is on the blockchain you can trust that it will stay there forever as long as you trust the network.
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:46:12
As long as people state that Bitcoin doesn't rely on trust, it's not pointless to educate them.
I'm not saying that this is a problem. It's just a fact.
Also Bitcoin does NOT inherently decentralize trust. It allows for trust to be decentralized. But it does not guarantee that this is the case.
@_date: 2018-04-19 07:52:05
Bitcoin still requires trust.
You have to trust 51% of the nodes and you have to trust miners to include your transactions in their mined blocks.

Actually they make good points. Although I would not classify the mentality as far-right. It's just generally extremist, as both left and right are equally susceptible to it.
And if you think Bitcoin allows you to take control of your own wealth, you are really delusional.
