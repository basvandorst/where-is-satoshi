Ok so my next question is hypothetically how would one go about getting mixed coins to a legal market 
@_date: 2019-03-14 20:06:11
Trying to move my coinjoined coins from wasabi wallet to electrum wallet for immediate purchase. Will putting all my joined coins into 1 wallet with new addresses for each coin deanonymize me

This is where I got my info. That's how I did it

Well it just wasnt confirming after the coins have been mixed. It took about an hr but they did finally get confirmed. I'm guessing it was just a busy system at the time. I appreciate your time to help me

I was under the impression that since electrum uses tor that it would be safe to run this version and setup in tails. 
Tails never mentioned any security issues or flaws when I ran electrum this way. 
So are you saying that I need to make a new tails now because its compromised.... if so.... what's another way of sending coins the way an updated proper electrum wallet would be in tails

Hi nopara, appreciate everything you do. I was just wondering why my coins are waiting for confirmation and how long it generally takes for them to be confirmed. That k you for your time
