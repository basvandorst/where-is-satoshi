I feel the pain, I will be 18 in just 2 months and there's nothing we can do, just use Binance instead tbh.
An option is to ask permission to one of your parents and use their ID to register if you really need to use Bittrex until you are 18.

I agree, alway good to diversify
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:59:34
I will
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:12:36
I see you point
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:13:51
im kinda late but...
localbitcoins and paxful will solve your problems until 18
if you live in a country where there's BTC ATMs avaliable, even better.

Obviously I still haven't read it all but this shit is fucked up from what I can understand 
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:35:50
I see, thanks
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:29:01
But why the hate against Bcash?
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:05:40
What are your opinions about ethereum and litecoins? Should I also invest a bit in these and not only bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:23:13
Why does this sub hate BCH? I'm new to cryptocurrencies so I don't get the hate.
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:54:22
Makes sense, thanks for answering, I'll do some research about BCH before I take a side in this.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:56:57
Im thinking about doing 0,05% in LTC and 0,05% in ETH, the rest for bitcoins.
Thanks for the answers.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:11:51
yeah, makes sense.
thanks for the answers, hope your mom is ok!!
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:45:47
I just plan in holding my coins, do you think bitcoin is just a safer option?
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:06:46
Thanks, another question, how do I know when its the right time to sell? I could sell it all after 5 years, but what if I waited 7 years instead, for example?
We cant know, can we?
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:45:57
Im new to this, how much should one invest per month so he can multiply his money in 4 or 5 years, for example?
100 usd/month a good start?
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:24:38
If I invest 100 dollars a month and just hold the coins will I be rich in 5 years?
