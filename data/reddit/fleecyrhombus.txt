If you purchase and transfer from GDAX it will be cheaper than doing so directly from coin base
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:39:45
Hahahahahaha my god 
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:46:57
Yes you should worry about “tax bullshit” for such a small amount. What makes you think you’re above the law?
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:41:37
Yes your gains would be proportional to your buy in price. 10% increase means 10% increase in your bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:32:42
You’re wrong. You would pay ordinary gains tax of 20% if you were in the 25-35% Tax bracket. Don’t give out tax advice if you don’t know your ass from a hole in the ground. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:16:16
um, yea maybe. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:00:42
Almost there, do some more research 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:37:40
I’ve heard people were having trust issues with them. Is that cleared and good now?
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:33:23
You sound truly brilliant, keep it up and be sure to reproduce /s
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:07:48
These bullshit posts need to be moderated and removed. Do we look like a god damn crystal ball!? Ffs who knows

What does this ass clown know about btc 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:06:17
If you’ve sent it to a valid incorrect address your bitcoins are toast 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:20:27
I know, I’m a corporate tax consultant, you wouldn’t believe the amount of ignorance around this sub when it comes to the liabilities that half these clowns are trying to hide out of. IRS wins every time 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:25:44
What about my instant confirmation? I don’t understand

@_date: 2017-12-03 23:22:39
Your gains are prorata to the amount you bought in and at what price 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:48:04
Last in first out isn’t allow because it defers gains tax. If you sold a low basis coin for a high gain and netted it against the price of a coin you purchased most recently, it would lower the true amount of gain you actually owe, and the unrealized gains wouldn’t reverse until you sold the other coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:44:28
This is such a bad idea. Jesus Christ why are so many people so financially illiterate?  
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:57:17
For starters do you even know what “shorting” is?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:12:12
No but something could be uncovered in the investigation of something else. If you go under audit and you are hiding something you better be damn lucky they don’t find it because if they do and they can prove you have intent to avoid the IRS they are going to swing their dicks around and put you in the slammer. Uncle Sam wants his cut  
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:17:57
Honest to god I just withdrew the funds to my address and it was free and fast as shit. Idk man

Sorry, I think the futures are good. But we should stop listening to a dot com billionaire who doesn’t know what he is talking about lol

Finally someone on this thread that has any idea of what they’re talking about. Thank you

Fucking idiot 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:33:57
Out of pure speculation and coming straight from the depths of my ass... I think it’ll draw back ~1,000 to 2,000 at most and then continue its climb. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:43:25
What the fuck 
@_date: 2018-09-23 21:53:37
What the fuck is the point of this shit post
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:26:30
Yes however the tax benefit would be the 3,000 times whatever their tax rate is. Not a total recapture but it would soften the blow in the event of a bitcoin meltdown 
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:18:16
Hahahahaha

Just get a Trezor and don’t even worry about it 
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:44:43
I say get a Trezor if the funds you will be storing are 10x the price of the device. So ~$1,000 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:33:16
If you’re such an expert why are you asking a group of random unqualified people? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:49:39
I️ think it will continue to soar, just keep buying and play your part in the ecosystem 
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:24:23
I don’t know why but GDAX is cheaper to use even though Coinbase owns them 
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:48:11
I’m going to be talking about these days like I️ was some pioneer witnessing the future unfold. Exciting times were in 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:27:17
I’m fucking pumped boys 
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:01:27
Coinbase incorporates a 50 point spread into their price in addition to fees. Fucking bullshit use GDAX
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:49:49
Appreciate it, my doot 
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:08:04
Fuck. You. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:42:18
This is my first time transferring these coins. Is there a risk of me screwing this up and losing my coins? The transfer from Coinbase to GDAX should be straight forward. Is it easy from there to send them to my Trezor?
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:50:32
Record the cost basis of your .5 btc as the fair market value of your vehicle. Get it appraised and get appropriate paper work proving so, that way when you go to sell you btc you can properly pay any capital gains tax. Retain the appraisal paperwork in case the taxing authority audits you. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:16:26
r/personalfinance already down voted you into oblivion when your brought this up. It’s clear that people think your unintelligent for even seriously asking these questions. Just stop paying and go sit in a fed penitentiary. Then you can sit down and think about why not paying your tax liability is a bad idea. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:15:54
Not even close, I have a good amount of money in as of right now. The issue is that I purchased through Coinbase and my BTC would be available to transfer to my cold storage wallet on October 27. I’m not sure I can sell prior to not physically having them 
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:36:48
How soon after the fork on 25th will the dip start to occur? At what point will it bottom out if you had to toss a guess out there? I’m assuming that using a short sale technique to try to accumulate more coins is super dangerous but maybe worth the risk
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:57:50
Honestly, track your trades by yourself using Microsoft excel. Make a spread sheet noting the exact dates you purchased, at what price you’ve purchased at, the exchange rate, and amounts in both currencies. Then do the same for your sales. At year end you can open your spread sheet and calculate your tax basis using whatever acceptable method you use (First in First Out, Average Cost, etc.). You will expose yourself to much less risk this way 
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:29:32
I can’t liquidate until the broker receives the fiat i traded in the first place. Once the transaction is complete I will just transfer my BTC from the exchanger to my hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:20:44
How about the fact that your IP address is attached to every comment you have made regarding tax fraud on Reddit. If the IRS or any other taxing authority wanted to catch your stupid ass you’d be behind bars before Friday. Idiot 
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:03:08
Not unless he shorts the coin and sells high and repurchases the exact same amount of coin back under the reduced price after the fork 
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:59:17
No kidding.  Almost 4% for debit/credit card, out of control lol 
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:33:52
That’s great news Redbeard. U think that I should just dump those shitcoins and reinvest into BTC? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:45:33
Look up the differences between a hard fork and a soft fork. Then research the previous forks that occurred and what happened as a result 
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:31:13
It’s trading at almost 6,000 right now 
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:09:05
So stop being a slave and give up on paying the taxes. You’ll just become a prisoner. At least “slaves” have free will in this country. Someone grab this guy his red nose 
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:17:20
I’m in this for the long haul but if I can make a quick move to short the coin and recoup what is essentially “free” coins I’m going to want to do that. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:28:30
Enlighten us wise one 
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:41:51
I just purchased a Trezor!! Should be here tomorrow 
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:32:03
I sent the broker my money and now the transaction is pending essentially. I don’t have any coins on my account until they clear on October 27. My question was referring to the ability to trade the coins on my buy in basis before I actually had them in my account 
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:00:00
Hold On for Dear Life 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:09:35
Now that makes perfect sense, thank you for clearing up my confusion. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:22:54
Touché, im going to hold my current position. If it drops like a stone I’ll just strengthen my position and.... hodl 
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:01:57
You are being a clown my man. This type of behavior is what negatively impacts the progressive nature of bitcoin. Pay you’re damn taxes and be a good citizen 
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:57:40
Well I’m implying “good” in the sense that if this guy lives in the USA, my taxes are supporting his retirement so he should do his part and contribute to society in the same way that every other upstanding citizen would do. If you want to avoid paying US tax liability fine by me, just don’t take advantage of our social programs. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:32:45
You can keep them as your long term coins if you so please, FIFO valuation would be used to calculate your basis for tax purposes so that you can properly pay your capital gains tax. If you don’t know what you’re doing, please reach out to a CPA. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:58:57
Are you telling me that Coinbase will not give me my bitcoin cash or gold after the fork because they manage the private key and coin for me? Please tell me that isn’t true 
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:44:56
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:50:49
How will I know if they give me Bitcoin Gold? I’m really sorry for my ignorance I’m trying to wrap my mind around some of this. What benefit is there to me as a holder of the coin when a fork like this is going to occur?
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:25:26
Yeah that settles that then lol. The only potential upside to this is that I could get whatever currency comes from this new fork. U think that Coinbase will let me have that at least?
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:35:43
For some reason, because I did a wire transfer it takes a few days to complete the transaction however the transaction fee was significantly less then if I would have used a debit or credit card to purchase the BTC. If I purchased the BTC with debit or credit then I would have had my coins available immediately but my fee would have been like 4% of the transaction 
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:43:14
Calm ur tits
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:00:00
Would you mind elaborating please? I guess I’m confused on the relationship between BTC and BCH and how selling BCH can drain your BTC balance 
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:49:49
Purchased through Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:11:59
No wonder the price is tanking. Unsuspecting users are unknowingly selling off BTC. That is concerning wtf is this about 
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:19:42
So what exactly did I purchase? What is Bitcoin cash and Bitcoin Gold? How does it differ from just bitcoin ? Which is more valuable ?
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:27:28
I understand, it’s now my understanding that I can’t make a move on my position until the transaction is fully settled anyways. Although this is something to consider in the future. However i just want to buy and forget and in 20 years we can ride our spaceships to mars 
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:18:33
Is this serious? What makes you think so
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:35:58
:/ 
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:09:32
Holy shit do you think some people out there who didn’t know about this just drained their accounts? Wow 
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:44:05
Just get in if you plan on keeping them for the long term. Volatility won’t effect your life if you aren’t selling and making those losses realized. Just purchase, cold store and hodl is the advice everyone has given me and based on my own research I too suggest doing the same. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:57:27
I’m running with a long strategy. I have decided to jump in and will continue making bi weekly injections into the wallet. I think this type of currency will be the way the world eventually runs. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:53:30
You’re asking this sub for your help in performing an illegal activity. This type of behavior is what is giving the media a field day with bitcoin. What you’re proposing to do is flat out ILLEGAL. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:06:13
What do you mean “if initialized in secure manner” 
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:36:02
So if I transfer from Coinbase to GDAX that transfer is completely free. From there if I transfer from GDAX to my Trezor is that transaction also free?
@_date: 2019-09-12 22:14:35
Incorrect information. Do some homework
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:51:59
So the 3.54 will be removed from Trezor and then the difference between the 3.54 and the transfer fee will show up in coinbase?
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:55:09
Well that’s great to hear. Thanks for your input brother have an updoot
