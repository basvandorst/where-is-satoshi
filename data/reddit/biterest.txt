Economy is going down the crapper, hey let's ban more innovation!

How long does it have to stay above 400?  seconds, minutes, hours, days?

Cloud storage should never be used for anything important imo (probably fine for storing any  encrypted containers on).  For peace of mind I run two 4TB encrypted NAS servers at home (they back each other up) and I do an off-site encrypted backup of them once a month.

sorry, I should have said no point to mining for profit by then

I'm quite comfortable with my big coin on bip38 wallets and my pocket coins on blockchain.info 2FA.  I can't bring myself to trust devices of any kind.  I know my paper is secure (3 different locations with strong pass phrase), and I'll never be able to fully trust most devices or software wallets.  yeah, pretty paranoid.

Paul Krugman must be shaking with rage right now.

How exactly are blockchain based smart contracts secured?  Let's say my house title is attached to one, then I get hacked and lose the contract to my house title.  What happens then?

It's not really Canada's decision.  NAFTA will likely make it a US decision that Canada is bound to obey.  Sorry to rain on the parade.

Get this guy in a debate with Andreas.

I think all Bitcoin needs is basically a Bitpay that can also accept credit cards for like 0.5%.  I would move my entire business to Bitpay if this were possible.

There will still be a "License" so adoption and use will simply follow the path of least resistance.  The Bitcoin world will flow around NY and not even think twice about it.

They hate it because the sheeple want to be controlled at every level.  They want centralized controls, they want to be bent over and screwed by their government and jobs because it's all they know.  Strangely enough it makes them feel safe.  The moment you try to break them free of the Matrix is when they get hostile and lash out.  We're going to have to do this on our own and hopefully along the way, they wake the hell up.

How will a global ebola outbreak effect Bitcoin?  It's spreading throughout the US now, some even claiming it's airborne.  This could be a massive event.

Try being an American expat, you'll never feel more violated.  American expats live under constant threat from the US gov/IRS and are punished in a variety of ways for leaving the USA.  We're viewed and treated as tax evading terrorists.   Of the 7 million expats, most like me live check to check and are poor as hell.

I hear these kiddie porn guys are using Blackbery Messenger (BBM) to send each other links and porn direct to their anonymous burner phone serial ID.  Due to this fact I am now calling for a complete ban of all cellphones globally.  For the children.

Slightly off-topic but as for traditional banking systems, they are likely to self destruct due to the simple fact they can't secure customer data any longer.  I've worked in banks and their security systems are like swiss cheese.  Often IT staff are grossly under staffed or even outsourced.  There are communication problems between staff, new hires in IT with massive password databases on their laptops, these password databases freely passed around among IT staff.  I could go on for pages.  Bitcoin isn't going to kill traditional banking, they are doing a perfect job of it themselves.

How are these bastards in control of us all, or presume to be?  I look forward to the Hong Kong scenario spreading globally and the masses putting these public servants back in their place.  They work for us, not own us.

He's like the Christopher Hitchens of Bitcoin.  Go ahead.. present me with any argument, I'll calmly and concisely eviscerate it while at the same time expanding your consciousness.

Overstock CEO is about to announce a Bitcoin based stock exchange.  Why wouldn't reddit contact him first?

They guy is likely bought and paid for by the banking cartels in NYC.  Back room deals "Ben, you need to make this thing go away NOW" "I'm doing the best I can, you do know it's decenterized right??"

I think $150 is the psychological bottom to this.  Once it hits $150 I'll buy around 20 coins.

There will be no point to mining by then.  People will have USB sized bitcoin nodes more powerful than a supercomputer.  They can node for the hell of it just to support the network.  Remember, the processing power of a Samsung Galaxy S5 will be able to fit inside a red blood cell by 2020 (at the current rate of exponential technology)

I can't wait for the exact moment traditional transaction companies drop to 50% usage and Bitcoin hits 50% usage.  Then I can't wait for the exact moment Bitcoin hits 50.1% usage and traditional systems drop to 49.9.  The stench of death in the air at these banking cartels will be glorious.
