Yeah, I just watched Kevin Rose interviewing Brian -

I was referring to things that we currently use that required a network of users.

Hey, he seems to have left you hanging. I show my friends this podcast episode, since the guest, Andreas Antonopoulos does such a great job at explaining a lot about what bitcoin means to someone who has little knowledge - 
@_date: 2014-04-22 15:49:34
I heard Andreas say that he hates that. It's just what common people say about someone who spreads the word about something I suppose.

You make a good point, and this is true. There was a moment or two where Joe had asked a very interesting question to Andreas, but Brian interrupted what was about to be an excellent conversation with an unrelated thought which derailed the direction Joe had intended.

Dude, there's already been a lot of adult film companies announcing they're accepting bitcoin this past 6 months.

Dude, that crash at around 1:30 was absolutely epic - you know how injured the guy was from that?

yes - I have a $25 giftcard to Chilis via Gyft. I went there to just buy a $10 burger, and I have my remaining balance on the same card to use next time.

Wait a minute. So is this an internet feud about disagreeing who made that gif first?

Looks like 2factor authorization so anytime your card is used its extra secure - this might be optional, but greatly reduces risk of someone stealing their card and using it successfully.

You taught me how to program 5 years ago! Your videos changed my life
