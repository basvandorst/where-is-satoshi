I believe we will go from dial-up to fiber optics in the bitcoin world.

@_date: 2016-04-21 20:20:11
More or further.

ok even though i was trying to insert a formula into your question but  nevermind, to answer your question 1. when all bitcoin are mined est 2142 if you look at btc graph from 2009-2016 you will see the steady increase in user adoption rate, now imagine what the graph will look like from 2009-2142 (new born population and beyond)  no one person will have 1.0 bitcoin by that time due to everyone has a selling point between now and 2142. 2. i doubt it will take 250 years or so, you are not considering technical world you are only looking at the totally outdated physical world (which is millennials behind). bitcoin is the  Mc Donalds of the crypto world

Never, more like inevitable.

Can Fiat leave its darkside behind
@_date: 2016-04-10 10:28:30
Please dont downvote me before i have a chance to prove to you.

Why does it not show on the OB desktop version
@_date: 2016-04-10 22:57:58
I actually been a reddit READER for YEARS before I actually signed up so my "account" would have years over yours atleast by a year. I bet you wouldnt bet your life on if it is a scam or not!!

@_date: 2016-04-09 18:06:55
Nice, we need more people to pay attention to you.
@_date: 2016-04-08 17:23:41
What if fiat is irrelevant?
@_date: 2016-04-05 00:29:51
OB is very underrated

I can try i dont know how to do that in particular I can send you screenshots or email you more data.

I highly disagree and i have proof, I have been mining with hashocean for awhile. On the users page you can see my reddit name and date ive started.(Im ranked 3798 as of this post if you want to take a looksy). -People should not listen to you trolls-

It's working for me.
@_date: 2016-04-29 17:13:09
@_date: 2016-04-08 00:55:31
Then if that happens we can always fork then problem solved. Or jump into an alt
@_date: 2016-04-21 11:02:20
As bitcoin price increase you are going to start seeing these stories come out.
@_date: 2016-04-26 20:33:06
Ive been with cloud mining for years. No problems for me.
@_date: 2016-04-10 10:24:54
Plz do not reply to me like that i can send you screenshots if youd like

Yes there are btc to fiat, this particular platform (bitshares) support different exchanges as well
 So you can use three exchanges on one platform according to your needs.
@_date: 2016-04-08 16:30:59
grasshoppa you still have lots to learn.
@_date: 2016-04-07 11:59:28
Mine anyways even if you get 1000 sats a day its still profitable, why? Because 1000 sats in 2018 will be worth more than todays price. 
@_date: 2016-04-08 17:24:25
Only in 2016 its not relevant. fiat will not be relevant in 2060 mark my words.
@_date: 2016-04-13 21:46:13
Bitcoin can be tranfered through radio signal. Did you forget.
@_date: 2016-04-08 16:24:35
considering the variable alts offer is less likely 
@_date: 2016-04-26 17:40:13
Highly doubt it. When coin half price increase 1000 sats will be 1 buck
@_date: 2016-04-15 21:29:26
So its a tax trap? :(
@_date: 2016-04-10 09:31:46

I might be wrong simply because college will be free in 18 years, even better people will be paid to go to college because there will be world war 7 called the education war against China India ;) but im seeing 3000 sats being 50 grand because of adoption, security and scarcity growing at rapid rate. 50 grand will be seen in 18 years as 5 grand is seen today.

Walk to dc and tell them to monitor you to death then it will happen.
@_date: 2016-06-13 15:12:36
Ive been with hashocean since 3/2015 they are legit. I remember when i first started, i was just signing up to every website giving away bitcoin. I dont know if you guys remember moonbit.

1000 sats in 2016, compare to 1000 sats in 2020. Now is mining profitable????
@_date: 2016-06-26 17:03:48
Not according to this

The Australian stolen bitcoin auction.
@_date: 2016-06-02 01:40:01
Rate increase equals more demand for dollar mean btc will slide a bit
@_date: 2016-06-05 22:33:46
Thank you for the response. I really appreciate that. I think its best to do both. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 18:10:18
It's all ETH fault. Ruining crypto.

You can use your older miners to mine alts

Why give your password when the person torturing you is being mean to you? The more they torture the less I give factor, or we suppose to do like our big screen films tell us to do and scream? :)
@_date: 2016-05-30 19:10:18
Maybe bc they hold until the Increase in price

Im Grateful for you Tony, That is a splendid idea, far from capricious.
@_date: 2016-05-17 15:17:04
Its still worth mining for the simple fact that I thought bitcoin mining wasnt worth it at 20 usd per btc. Boy, I was surely wrong. What you mine today will be worth more tomorrow, catch my drift?
@_date: 2016-05-23 19:45:45
You have a point, but is it bitcoin news or just news in general decreasing. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 22:40:14
Buy red , sell green , repeat.
