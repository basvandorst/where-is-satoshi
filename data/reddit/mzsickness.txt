Your analysis is off. You see you start at the lowest lows and build your model from that. You actually graphed the lowest possibility! It's possibly even higher!

Nah not really they REALLY care about outstanding debts, income, and assets. They don't really even care about monthly bills except for ones related to debts.
You could have 10 years perfect payments on credit cards and loans, but if your household (of 2) has ~$1-2,000/mo in total debt and even make $60,000  year they'll quote the two of you to probably a maximum loan of around $150,000-200,000 if you're lucky your interest rates will be a bit better if you have good history. That will likely max you out and getting any other loans, like for a new car will be shit show.
Debt/capital is the name of the game again.
Source: walk into a bank and have a 10 minute convo with the banker. (Who will then advise you to shop around for loans within the next 30 days so the huge influx of credit checks won't ding you)
They want usually maximum 30-40% debt payments to total gross income for fixed rates that don't suck ass; if not the renter's office is 2 blocks over.
10+ years ago they didn't even validate fucking income.... now they want at least 60-120 days income varification.
