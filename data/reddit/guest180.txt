BTC is currently a default currency pair for all alts.
Until that changes (and coinbase opening a BCH on ramp doesn't help), BTC will continue to have value.

That's not really a good reason as the majority of both BTC and BCH hashpower are based in China due to the economics there

From the lighting network whitepaper - it states that the LN requires 133 MB size block if the intent is to enable 7 billion people to make two transaction/day.
Of course - on chain transactions will require 24 GB blocks every 10 minutes.
So I really don't understand why people were against the 2x compromise. But it's too late now. People who wanted bigger blocks already moved on.

Common brain wallet seed words;
Also segwit addresses are coded as anyone can spend in older reference clients.

In any exchange where people buy alt coins, there are alts/BTC trades.
While there are alts/USDT trades and alts/ETH trades, there are 
currently no default alts/BCH trades on most exchanges
(though those exchanges have BCH/USDT, BCH/ETH, and BCH/BTC)
So if you wanted to buy an altcoin like XMR and had BCH to trade for it; you would have to first  trade your BCH to either USDT, ETH, or BTC for it. And not all exchanges have a ETH or USDT pairing for that alt (ie, looking at bittrex and PIVX)

Yes, something like that.
Its just that coinbase added USD to BCH; so its not like BCH is unpopular now.
