The difference is: they control gold; literally have it in their own vaults. They can't control BTC.
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:47:25
Yep. I'll believe all of these legal and government machinations, all of these Wall Street executives jumping into the industry, all of these exchanges and custody services starting, **all of this** is being put in place to play around in a lousy $250 billion market when pigs fly. 
$250 billion is a quarter the size of a single large publicly-traded tech company.
I don't know when –could be months, could be years– but at some point the dam is going to break.

FYI, $14 to $20,000 is a 142,857% gain.
It's kinda like winning $20K in a scratch ticket lottery, *for every single BTC you owned at $14*

It's basically a book about becoming a rentier-class parasite, and of learning to think of your victims as chumps who are "exploiting themselves" for not also becoming rentier-class parasites.
He's essentially a capitalist sociopath who got rich training other aspirational capitalist sociopaths.
A lot of people took his advice, though, which is one reason the world is now overrun with rentier parasites and rents are out of control.
@_date: 2018-08-15 17:42:23
This is true, and I personally enjoy jamming the faces of sadistic sociopaths and trolls into the mud when they talk shit and then are later proven wrong. It's a total rush. 
Never whine about insensitive people, simply target, destroy, and make horrifying examples of them. Putting the heads of sociopaths and assholes on pikes is **far** more effective than bitching about your feelings.

If you were that rich in fiat, BTC would scare the living shit out of you too. Imagine you are running the table at a real-world game of Monopoly when suddenly the other players say, "meh, we're gonna use a new currency, sorry. In fact, we're gonna create 1500 of them".
At that moment –if you're Gates or Dimon or Buffet– you realize you've spent your life hoarding something that likely has no future value at all. That's why they sputter about rat poison and baby brains, they're *enraged* to be beaten at their own game.

Where did I ever claim I was a revolutionary, dimwit? A tech stack that lies completely out of my understanding? lolol Brother I could kick your ass so hard as a software engineer that your anus would be hanging out of your mouth (if it isn't already).
You know what the real difference between us is? You're smart enough to grok blockchain tech while being simultaneously so fucking stupid you place your faith in a culture that is staggeringly obviously killing everything. People like you are as common as crabgrass, as cockroaches, thousands, *millions* of technocratic dweebs like you this culture is crawling with them. I'm surrounded by your ilk all day every day here in Silicon Valley; hyper-analytical crazies, drunk on hubris, mistaking technological fluency for intelligence.
Try getting off your own couch sometime, going outside, and learning that the deeply intertwining systems that matter most are the natural ones being destroyed in sacrifice to these economic ones you're obsessed with; natural systems on which your sad little life as a gormless technocratic dweeb depends, whether you choose to believe it or not.

Yes, but what will $250,000 be worth in 2022?
Somehow people speculating about BTC prices never take into account the fact that the US dollar could collapse in value. There are hyperinflation scenarios where the price of a Bitcoin exceeds $30 million USD.

Again, Visa is *failing* at incredible speed. No crypto can match such rapid, real-world transaction failure.

Has anyone yet benchmarked how fast Nano can fail to process a transaction? Could be interesting. My sense is that Nano *doesn't* fail to process transactions, unlike Visa, but I could be wrong.

Let the bears have their fun. This is their time. They wish it would last forever, that the entirety of the crypto market cap would drop to nothing, that people would cry and wail and tear at their hair forever, saying “you were right! I was such a greedy fool! Why didn’t I listen to your superior wisdom!?” In other words, bears are jerking off right now. 
This trend, like all others, will end in however many months or years, the market will grow to be worth multiple trillions of dollars, and when it does the bears will quietly slink back to their caves and await their next day in the sun when *this time*, no doubt, everyone will lose it all.

"...I keep my storage cold..." lol
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:09:14
Lol. C'mon. I get that you don't want to hear how crypto is inevitably going to die. You can pretend it's something reliable, whereas fiat is not, but it's just another artifact of just another transient civilization; and one totally dependent upon complex technologies that render it highly vulnerable to collapse. 
So if you want to use history to back up your arguments as to why crypto is so superior, you don't get to ignore what history has to say about the fragility and inevitable collapse of the civilization crypto relies upon to be worth anything at all.
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:40:32
You should Google Joseph Tainter's *The Collapse of Complex Societies*. The more complex a civilization becomes, the faster it accelerates towards inevitable collapse. And never has a civilization been so primed for collapse as this one. 1971 was 47 years ago. This civilization is highly unlikely to last till 2065, so I wouldn't count on crypto having as long as run as US fiat has already had.
And there's nothing moot about it. If I have a chest of gold coins, and you have 100 BTC, and this set of living arrangements collapses - your crypto loses all value, but my gold doesn't.
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:46:49
Yes, absolutely true. Another thing that has occurred without exception throughout recorded history is the collapse of every civilization. The current global techno-industrial system is no exception, and when it inevitably collapses your crypto goes with it.

@_date: 2018-04-25 16:57:20
A point? Sure: if you're going to point out historical inevitabilities (not personal ones, like death), don't gloss over the one that will eventually (possibly quite soon, a nuclear holocaust could finish industrial civilization 20 minutes from now) end cryptocurrency.
