Square emailed me back; saying withdrawal verification takes 48-72 hours. Now we wait!

What else entails verification withdraw process? Already got my DL and a fucking selfie lol.
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:35:55
Yeah I did that too, and had to take a selfie to enable withdraw. Just waiting for that verification to finish. I've been waiting about 18 hours.

I haven't used coinbase since 2015. Used Circle for quite a while then LocalBitcoin for almost 2 years. Coinbase always just pissed me off. They stayed on that fuck shit. IMO

As soon as they approve my verification for withdraw I will let you know which options they give me on moving the btc, and to where. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 06:47:31
I didn't notice that.. I just dropped 500; it says enable withdraw so I'm verifying that way right now. So when withdraw is enabled I can't move from the wallet it's in right now to say electrum, etc etc?

 my identity hasn't been verified yet, but here it is showing how you can move btc to external btc wallet. Hope this helps!

Don't feel bad my best friend tried to get me to spend my whole tax  return on BTC at 9 dollars a coin said that shit was a scam... If I would have... Well we all know that story.

Yeah the not being able to deposit into the system is why I deleted it huge bummer 
@_date: 2019-09-05 21:35:43
True. But why are the transaction so slow on BTC? I don't get me won't I own both but some times those transaction times get so aggravating

Really? Damn thanks for the informative comment, actually explaining something to me. I still use both just got curious about Bitcoin Cash. And had purchased some. I got into BTC back in 2014 bought my first coin. I never just "made the switch" I read some stuff and felt genuinely interested ill look more into this.
