It's arguable. Whatsapp has millions of peoples' information. Bitcoin has none really. Nowadays information (especially peoples numbers/friend list/patterns/consumption etc) is very valuable. Makes sense?
@_date: 2014-09-08 18:16:36
The volailtility CANNOT DECREASE as the current price is not going to be able to support a larger system. More people use, more value it has in terms of fiat, and therefor, it will be volatile as the user base and market cap increase or decrease. I think u just want the value to increase and you consider that non volatile? In this case you are misguided.
Increase in users/useage and money coming in = volatility

The topic you brought up interest me very much. I did my fair learning on the topics of Ai as well as bitcoin. They seem to me like completely different animals. 
Bitcoin is monotone, and can have programs written on it ( or ethereum like someone mentioned is even better?) This doesn't mean its anywhere on the path to so called intelligence.
For intelligence the machine would need to 'feel' emotions, and not just sense danger or discomfort.

 there is a real possibility that the “merchant adoption” effect could spiral out of control if the selling pressure from new merchants is so great as to induce other people to dump their bitcoins. Once this happens, the price of Bitcoin could drop to zero in minutes.

There just needs to be a fully visible timeframe association with each account. So assuming the sellers account was operating for 1 year and has positive reviews, it should be more important than how much he 'burned'.
If i see a seller long time in the business and have great reviews and ratings why should i demand he "burns" his profits to somehow seduce me to buy like that?
Do you see any other business or marketplace doing that?
Do you see vendors in flee markets burning dollars to see who can burn more?
Has this ever been done?
Putting money into advertiding and customer education is way different
Also if it's a completly free market than there should be no problem with people getting scammed. It should be
 completly free of any interference. The market itself will eradicate these and naive/uneducated customers will pay for their lack of due dilligence and be more vigilant next time.

Yea. Since I think the crazy speculative phase of bitcoin is over, and I missed out, I do not invest much of my money into it. 
To me, psychologically it is much easier to go from single digits dollars to hundreds. Many stocks do it. But, from hundreds to millions there is a big psychological barrier and feasibility.

Please explain why it is not better to have your own central wallet? What I mean is once someone purchases on your site, why not have the btc go to your wallet, and once it goes through and gets processed by coinbase or bitpay then distribute it to your vendor. It can be a two way signature so that the merchant can have definite proof the product was bought
Please explain why what you are
 doing is better. Is it because you don't want large amounts of btc/fiat going through you?

i changed it:
Bitcoin has been a subject of scrutiny amid concerns that it can be used for illegal activities, for which any other currency, namely the US Dollar has also been involved with.[26] Bitcoins are used to purchase illicit items—including child pornography, credit card details, and drugs—at deep web black markets,[note 7] and are seized by authorities when such sites are shut down. In June 2014, GQ journalist Marshall Sella concluded that what remained of the Silk Road black market site was one of the few places where one could purchase items for bitcoins.[28]

“Euro banknotes and coins are a method of payment of stable value, acceptance of which is compulsory, and thus they are superior to alternative methods of payment”
This is the same money that enslaved the European continent and brought economic chaos in Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy, France, ireland and Iceland abd the baltics. 
Of course it is good for some (huge european banks) but the Euro experiement seems very toxic to me. I hope Ukraine never falls for that trap either.

There are better alternatives such as reddcoin. Its algorithm and developer input is more optimised for microtransactions. It doesnt even have 'mining' in the bitcoin sense.

inevitably the open and annonymous bitcoin network will fall to regulations and government control.

Setad, (short for Persian: ستاد اجرای فرمان حضرت امام Setad Ejraiye Farmane Hazrate Emam or "Headquarters for Executing the Order of the Imam"), is a multi-sector Iranian business organization in the Islamic Republic of Iran, with holdings of 37 companies, and an estimated value in US dollars of $95 billion. It is under the control of the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, and created from thousands of properties confiscated from Iranians.
From wikipedia. 
It is a serious organization that has lot of money available.
if even some of that money ( even 10%) starts being converted into bitcoin, this will be a very substantial and important milestone. 
please look up what this secretive organization is and make your own conclusions.
BTW, if directly under the Ayatollah's control, this makes the Ayatollah one of the richest, if not the richest person on Earth..

Yes if you can negotiate a deal with the CC companies to get 1.15% it would be negligible to tinker with a new technology with a dodgy reputation (SR MTGOX..)
But if you are a local sushi place or a small/medium online retailer you would be comparing CC rates of 2.5-4%
Btw my local all-you-can-eat sushi place down the street told me they dont accept CC because of the 4% and the small convenience store on that same plaza didnt accept CC payments exactly for the same reason. 
they said the lottery and cigarette purchases would destroy them.

To adapt to the 21st century all charities must strongly consider crypt I currencies if not immediately implement them. 
There is the problem of converting the cryptourrencies into the local fiat currencies.the solution would be to go through coinbase or bitpay or a similar service provider to immediately convert cryptocurrencies , mainly bitcoin, into fiat. For even small monthly fees there would be minimal fees, especially for large volumes( with unlimited service).
Charities as well as other businesses cannot just do business as before the age of the internet and rely solely on visa and paypal.

Why cant bitpay/coinbase /whoever else come up with a merchant solution where lets say 1% (or any other customizable %) gets held in BTC from every sale?

* Bitcoin consists of the Bitcoin Protocol and the bitcoin (lower case) currency unit. 
* The Bitcoin protocol is a peer-to-peer ledger without a central authority to act as middleman, best described as "decentralized".
* A network of computers runs a software that solves increasingly difficult computational problems for which bitcoins are rewarded at a constant rate. This process can be done independantly or at a "mining pool" which is a network of people combining their efforts and sharing the rewards. 
* The number of bitcoins is capped at 21 Million, however it is theoretically very divisible into smaller units. 
* bitcoin can be stored in a "wallet" on physical hardware like a harddrive, USB or a piece of paper or stored online at one of many competing "wallet" providers. 
* bitcoin can be bought from exchanges or in person. It's price is driven by supply and demand.
* bitcoin can be sent to anyone and anywhere in the world where internet exists almost instantly and almost for free .

From wikipedia:
 
In 1971, the PRC assumed China's seat at the United Nations, which the ROC originally occupied. International recognition of the ROC has gradually eroded as most countries switched recognition to the PRC. Only 21 UN member states and the Holy See currently maintain official diplomatic relations with the ROC, though it has unofficial ties with most other states via its representative offices.
( ROC stands for Republic of China, Taiwan's rulers)

Bitcoin might just become a solid international method for transmitting large amounts of money especially between financial institutions or corporations. 
The protocol might become a public asset ledger with many chains. It will not be responsible for the majority of transactions but just as the backbone.
It will probably not be used to tip on fb 20 cents or buy alpaca socks from kansas
@_date: 2014-05-01 17:32:22
Venezuela should not be on that list. It is a totalitarian regime with strict capital controls.

True capitalism is making profit at the expense of others. ( there is also subcategories like vulture capitalism, cronycapitalism for example..) 
It is rhe opposite of communism/socialism where everytthing is shared.

It is a commodity. just like gold. virtual money token that can be redeemed. 
It doesn't quite fit the standard definition of currency and MOREOVER a legal tender national currency which must be accepted by merchants by LAW. 
Although throughout history "currency" varied greatly, from sticks, to clam shells to gold coins.
It is perhaps incorrect to keep using the "coin" part in bitcoin, as it confuses from what bitcoin really is, a decentralized payment protocol/
What is even worse, is the volatility. The ability to  store of value of bitcoin which makes it much harder to be actually used as a medium of exchange.

2. (n) Derogatory term for slovenly nerdy people who have no sense of hygene or grooming. Often related to hobbies such as card gaming, video gaming, anime, et. al.

maybe set up a place where people can walk in and buy bitcoins. call it the Palm Bitcoin Centre or something like that. 
getting bitcoins is very important and is a tedious task still. Offer to sell, like in LocalBitcoins. obviously don't sell anything over your states KYC/AML regulations ( i wouldn't sell more than a few BTC at once)
once people show up, there should be someone who is knowledgeable and explain how to buy, send, receive and where to spend it in general.

my guess is that hype caused the price to spike so much together with MTGOX withdrawal issues and possible price manipulation by bots. 
The price now is more inline with where it should be. possibly it will go down even lower to pre-bubble levels. 
Nothing right now supports such high price for a bitcoin. It works just as well at 10 dollars a pop.

This thing is a logical progression, but I dislike this even more. Facebook is a greedy, data-mining corporation. Their money transfer system might work on some people, but I don't trust them at all. 
It is also highly centralized. Id rather do a money email transfer or use my bank or even western union than to use facebook for such purposes.

I agree with the article. Bitcoin's underlying block chain technology and the upcoming 2.0 versions ( coloredcoins/darkcoin.. Even ethereum as well as other ownership transfer providers) are the truly revolutionary aspects. 
Bitcoin confirmation times hurt its usefulness. I know that you can layer it so it would be instant off the block and all.
Bitcoin seems more of an internet money, and this is where it should shine. For online orders it doesn't matter if it takes an hour for the confirmations.

Ignorant article.
The bitcoin network is almost impossible to break and it runs on more processing power than all of the world's supercomputers combined. 
The fact that an incompetent and possibly very corrupt exchange lost money doesn't change that. 
This can't continue to be used as a reason. Get over it. 
They forget to mention how several hundreds of millions of peoples info got stolen recently over at target and how even the Canadian government cannot process taxes now that they have been exposed to attacks.

i have to reccomend something:
From my buddys experience, he got into bitcoin a while ago ( when you could mine with GPU's)
he had 8 $800 GPUs running and 1 1.8? TH Cointerra ASIC at one point
He lives in a 3 Bedroom Condo and pays i believe 600/month for utilities and maintenance. This gives him unlimited electricity.
Wouldn't a setup like this be MUCH more profitable for you or anyone who is into mining? imagine saving 1200 a month just doing this
Note: his condo can handle the consumption and he NEVER got questioned by the building or anyone else as to the amount of power he is consuming
@_date: 2014-04-26 15:42:43

Since you pay fees in any bank, this is a no brainer. So i switched from cibc. I dont give a fuck which bank i use. It's all the same in Canada.
15x12 is 180, less than half price of the ipad. Makes sense now?

Bitcoin is like.cash or debit. U must have money in your account (wallet) in order to spend. MasterCard/visa are credit cards meaning you borrow. People use them online because that is how the system was set up before bitcoin and other online payment systems. 
Me, personally, much rather use my money to buy online vs borrowing from the credit card companies at 20% ( yes I know if you pay the full balance during your period there will not be any interest bit most people just continue to accumulate unsustainable debt)

Dogecoin or peercoin or whatever coin can all facilitate the same inputs and outputs as the "bitcoin" blockchain. 
Same as custom centralized blockchains can be created to do a certain task. What? All you need is one gpu and mine away. And yes, i know it defeats the purpose of the
 decengralized ledger
That man seems to really like ripple. USD goes in AUD comes out kinda thing

changetip is fun. but, it is not a decentralized app... and technically doesnt need bitcoin to do the same. I could just load dollars and tip them same way. Cool app though.

I always liked ripple's approach. The xrp is just there to grease the gears and irs developers dont forsee ut being expensive. Besides, why shouldn't they profit from their efforts? The original bitcoin "premine" was also huge, and transactions still cost money

Why should i be disclosing my financial statements and be transparent with my money? Would you walk into a macdonalds and ask for their financial statement and profits? 
Complete transperancy must exist in exchanges though as they must be accountable for others' funds&gt;I have debated with both; people who think it is impossible and, people who think it is easy. Fractional reserve banking is possible, but just more difficult with bitcoin, as there should be a push for bitcoin businesses to be more transparent with funds. The bitcoin businesses who are more transparent are more likely to come out on top therefore lending people's bitcoins out without their permission becomes more difficult.

who is their main man? alex jones? even CIA doesn't know what CIA does
@_date: 2014-08-28 04:30:57
this makes a ton of sense. however, it is a fact that just like recording and listening to literally HUNDREDS of millions phone calls , scanning countless emails and infiltrating every government in the world they can and will do what they want ..

hungry Africans, workers in the rice fields, grandmas and unionized construction workers and plumbers probably not the most immediate target.. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 18:56:41
It probably is if you look at it like stocks. Im not talking about price explosion. Im talking about utility and need.

Lmao.  So how is dodgecoin more "simple" than streight up bitcoin or namecoin or litecoin or peercoin etc etc.. ?
@_date: 2014-07-25 18:57:09
Most people are ignorant sheep. Most dont care about privacy, freedom and inflation or what not. Just tbe sheer number of selfies, useless fb and twitter posts and complete lack of giving a fuck about being constantly tracked and monitored. 
I anything bitcoin should be advertised as cool, trendy and socially acceptable thing... not dark web and annonimity with the annonymus white mask logo..
