Bisq solves this in a genius way with the DAO.

neither....coldcard all the way for bitcoin only. i first bought a trezor and feel like an idiot connecting to the computer and accessing the wallet via browser, compared to the air gapped cold card with PBST...

hmm i must not be  explaining well enough (but it is also a bit abstract). your seed does not recover your “money”...ever...not for any wallet. your seed only generates a wallet, and is mathematically only ever associated with that one wallet. a wallet is just a set of keys. that’s it. public and private keys. the keys are what’s associated with what you call your money. the keys are what’s associated with transactions on the bitcoin ledger. what’s on the ledger (the permanent record) is the only thing that matters here. it’s the only thing that’s “storing” anything. 
when you sync the wallet on a computer after restoring it using your seed, it just connects to the bitcoin network to confirm the transactions associated with those keys (aka the wallet) on the bitcoin ledger. if the ledger says that 9 years ago you had 290 bitcoin sent to your keys (aka wallet), then you have 290 bitcoin associated with your keys (aka wallet), and therefore you “have” 290 bitcoin on that wallet (which is just an association of that set of keys to the transactions on the ledger).

OP said most BASIC... which is taking a pen and writing your keys on a piece of paper.
no one really physically “has” or “owns” any bitcoin....per say. wallets only store the keys...most importantly the private key needed to spend the bitcoin associated with a particular address on the bitcoin ledger.

now if we’re talking most secure bitcoin HW wallet....easy....coldcard wallet. my fellow people of reddit need to hop off this trezor/ledger bandwagon.

same as any other wallet. through your seed phrase, or microSD backups. 
this is my understanding: like i was saying before, the seed is generated inherently in the wallet upon its creation. it does not need to be connected to the internet. the only time it becomes “public” or connected i guess is when you transact with the wallet (send or receive bitcoin). now, the transactions to this wallet are forever imprinted on the bitcoin ledger. 
so now, say you generated the wallet (and seed) offline, received bitcoin via connecting the microSD to a computer, and then POOF... microSD and the coldcard suddenly get blown to bits. well then, i buy a shiny new coldcard, enter the seed phrase from when i created the wallet, and the seed phrase generates the wallet inherently associated with that seed. i plug the microSD into the computer, and bam, electrum or wasabi syncs the transactions associated with my wallet. 
bitcoin SAVED!! does that make more sense?

sorry for the delay. not only is it not connected to the internet, it doesn’t even have to be connected to a computer. it does this using Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PBST). Essentially, you can partially sign transactions onto a microSD inside the device, and then transfer the microSD to a computer to complete the transaction. you can even generate a completely random seed phrase with dice. sounds fancy, but actually super simple to learn/use. youtube has a bunch of great tutorials, and there are also a bunch linked on coinkite’s website
*and you only mentioned bitcoin, so i gave my opinion of the best bitcoin-only solution :) i still use trezor for the minor shitcoins i hold, but it honestly feels significantly inferior to coldcard whenever i use it (especially security-wise). and the coldcard is just cool man... has that fundamentalist feel
@_date: 2019-11-21 02:24:13
your seed doesn’t know anything, it’s just the starting point for deriving a set of keys aka your wallet. all that matters is the transactions associated with those keys on the bitcoin ledger.  does that make sense?
@_date: 2019-11-21 01:56:51
correct. my mistake, i didn’t read that you specifically said receiving. the device will install a file on the microSD to give electron or wasabi access to the wallet’s public key. so when you put the microSD in your computer, electrum or wasabi will recognize the file/public key and you can receive that way. 
this has a seed just like any other wallet. (just more secure options for generating it) a seed is inherently generated when creating a wallet and is always associated with it as such. there is no need for it to be connected to the internet when generating (or ever).
you can also create as many backups as your heart desires on the microSD cards
@_date: 2019-11-21 14:18:03
because cryptography. keys/addresses/bitcoin are all cryptographically/mathematically linked.
let me try to oversimplify it. say your wallet generates seed ABC offline (combining seed/keys/wallet/address here for simplification, as they’re all cryptographically linked). you add seed ABC to electrum (electrum will sync to the bitcoin network and show 0 balance as this is a new wallet) and then you send 1 bitcoin to ABC. that 1 bitcoin is now forever and always linked to ABC ON THE NETWORK. so when you lose your wallet, buy a new one, and recover seed ABC, the wallet DOES NOT know how many bitcoin is on ABC at this point. when you add ABC to electrum again, just as you did before, electrum will sync to the bitcoin network and see that you have 1 bitcoin that was cryptographically linked to ABC from before.
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:12:32
exactly. i think maybe you have to understand that when you generate a seed, it does not create keys (a wallet i guess you can say) out of thin air. it always has and will mathematically exist. so a wallet never needs to be connected to the network to tell it that ABC seed is associated with 123 private key associated with XYZ address. they are already cryptographically/mathematically associated even before they “exist.” so when you send your 900 satoshis to address XYZ, it cryptographically knows what seed/keys are linked to it. that’s the magic of it all!

I would recommend reading The Bitcoin Standard: The Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking to understand why a bitcoin economy is not susceptible to these waves of recessions induced by centrally-backed fiat currencies

Even if I have a paper backup of the seed words? My understanding was that the electronic copy would be lost, but can be restored using seed words.
@_date: 2019-08-30 15:46:46
Thanks for your response. Apologies for my lack of knowledge, but what’s the harm if the MicroSD card happens to fail? Can’t a backup just be restored to a new MicroSD card? Just trying to understand the value in a more fail-safe Micro-SD card. I can see the value in a more indestructible Coldcard.
@_date: 2019-10-07 15:12:43
i would recommend reading The Bitcoin Standard and/or The Little Bitcoin Book. definitely more readable and applicable for a newbie than lopp’s materials, great as his stuff is.
@_date: 2019-08-31 01:08:59
Great info. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-08-30 15:54:24
I get that it’s data corruption. But say for instance my MicroSD card corrupts.. Can’t I just pop a new one into the Coldcard and restore my data?
@_date: 2019-08-30 16:03:13
Understood. Thank you.

and if you’re worried about being too late.... google bitcoin stock to flow charts for a gander at what COULD be

no problem. or, if you prefer listening, there are tons of podcasts. check out off the chain by pompliano or what bitcoin did by McCormack to start. pomp’s latest episode with svetski is great, as well as McCormack’s latest episode with PlanB
