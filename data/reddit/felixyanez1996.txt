Sorry to hear you didn't like it. But yes, in an article about banning Bitcoin I assume countries will ban Bitcoin. I spoke about BTC and not cryptos as a whole because the technology for every cryptocurrency is different, so writing about "crypto as a whole" would be foolish. And in regards to the latter of your message, I "fish for clicks" so that people read the content I spend time making and to expand the blog. Don't think I was fishing for it but thats a personal opinion

I'm now at the point where I'm fully convinced that cryptocurrencies have the potential to alter the present centralised financial system. But before they do that, they're going to have to survive attacks intended to destroy it. I decided to do some reading into if and how Bitcoin can be killed and published an article on my blog discussing my findings. If you're interested, I've left the link below. Hopefully you learn something you didn't already know and it serves some purpose for you:

If you think that I'm trying to ignite some sort of surge on Walton's price then you're simply very confused. And yes, after stating that I think Walton is an under-valued coin I am unsurprisingly holding Walton. I'm not sure about you but I tend to do those things; buy coins when theyre undervalued.

The term “bubble” is being used more than ever in our crypto community and it’s alarmed me. Therefore I decided to do some research and consequently wrote a new blog post about my conclusions that we are indeed in a bubble because of the confusion and imbalance between the value of a coin and the price of a coin. I hope it opens your brain to new ideas , thoughts and expands your current knowledge. If you want to check it out it’s here:

Well anyone who is well-versed and been in cryptos for at least 8 months; preferably someone working within the industry. If you think youre a good candidate then feel free to message me and I can explain more.

Why do you say that?
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:55:43
Yeah sure thing.
The article firstly explains the 3 functions of money and why we work 40 years of our life to earn a piece of paper. It then explains the deficiencies of the present monetary system. It then concludes by touching on cryptocurrencies and the role that they can play to improve the global financial system. 
Hope that helps

Whether we need crypto or not is a very subjective matter; so there is no conclusion, you make your own assumptions based on the intel we provided and what you already know.

I don't think its a false dichotomy. 
The fact that it is "a dumb questions" and "isn't a legitimate question" is completely subjective to your opinion.
Why are you calling it a dichotomy? Because it can be both?
@_date: 2018-11-06 14:08:27
Why do you think it's a dumb question? Feedback so far has been positive so we've helped others who are intrigued
Not sure how this is clickbait? The content of the post is exactly what I advertised it to be.

Although I agree, that wasn't the question though. I wasn't comparing BTC to fiat. I was exploring what BTC would be best used as

This is because Monero forks are soft forks. 
Hard fork: Splitting the blockchain into 2 (thus creating 2 coins) because of a protocol change. eg: Bitcoin forked to create Bitcoin Cash
Soft fork: Changing the protocol, but on the same blockchain (no need to create another coin) eg: Ethereum's Byzantium update

You're right and that's why the article highlights that decentralised digital currencies will thrive more in less economically developed nations in contrast to major world economies.

After studying the devastating effects that centralised currencies can have, like in Venezuela where the price of a coffee has risen by 718%, we decided to write a blog post studying alternative solutions. We concluded that cryptocurrencies can definitely help bring millions of people out of poverty. If you want to learn more:

This isn't obvious for everyone though.

At present, that is very true. But once software and tech inudstry related products/services are matured, the market that they operate in is monopolised but just a couple of firms. In the case of cryptos, once BTC develops, improves and matures, in a few years time it may be able to scale efficiently and do everything else that every other coin offers. The main reason for alt coins existing is to improve on the aspects that BTC does badly. It's going to be interesting though because digital currencies don't/won't behave like a traditional product/service because it has no authority behind it.

I remember watching that Q&amp;A. Lightning's future infrastructure looks exciting

It hasn't been forked though. No new currency was born.

Unfortunate that you think that but it really isnt. I spoke about loads of coins and briefly touched on Seele.
