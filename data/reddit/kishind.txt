3. Blend in

AnCap is arguably not anarchy, but leaving that aside...
Corporate heads and extreme wealth have very similar "power over" people when compared with government.  Obviously murders and kidnappings, including justifiable ones, are primarily the domain of governments.  Economic hierarchies are not peer relationships.
I've never liked AnCap because it encourages the black market approach to business.  It's reasonable to expect large corporations to become cartels, since they will become responsible for securing their own interests, making some form of military power necessary.

They can do that already, and have the legal resources to punish any innovators that want to challenge them.  Innovations are motivated by more than simple money, and are built upon the ideas and advancements of people who came before.  While I believe financial rewards for innovators are appropriate, it should be recognized as a contribution to human society (the common wealth of information) and not awarded a limited monopoly.

We need to distinguish between direct democracy and participatory democracy.  Majority rule is dangerous for minorities.  Participatory politics, or [ParPolity]( works on the principle "Everyone should have a say in any decision proportionate to the degree they are affected."  This principle is inherently protective of minorities and peer relationships.  Of course, it would mean every person would require some bureaucratic training so that they can maximize their contributions to group policy and planning.  It shouldn't be much more difficult than teaching people Occupy's General Assembly procedures.

The noble purpose of governments is to secure and promote the natural rights of humans.  By the consent of the governed a government can claim legitimacy. (paraphrasing the Declaration of Independence)
I agree that implementation of governments, so far, has been a load of shit.  Governments exist to protect the influence of the influential from the power of the "powerless".  Even as a democratic republic, it doesn't take long for the natural authority of the people to be replaced with an illusion.
Struggles between the aristocratic and democratic elements of society have been repeating themselves over and over again for millennia.  Einstein referred to it as the pendulum between anarchy and tyranny.  I wonder... will either side win?  Or will we keep swinging back and forth until the end of the species?

The most effective motivating forces are three: 
- coercion by credible threats of physical force  
- moral inspiration (such as the civil rights movement)  
- promises to pay, offering of resources
You may find [this video on motivation]( interesting.  Money is the best motivator for mechanical efforts, hierarchical management is the best method to encourage compliance, but creative efforts are better motivated by other factors.  Autonomy, mastery, purpose, and social recognition are valuable motivators that are underutilized in our economic models.
I certainly recognize that a capitalist republic is the best way *yet* to manage human resources... but we can do better.  We have glaring inefficiencies (like planned obsolescence and artifical scarcity) that need to be addressed, but effectively serve a profit motive.
I believe we can utilize money motivations in individuals more effectively under a libertarian socialist model, tying compensation to the time and effort invested in work.  I know we can switch manufacturing to a high quality "as-needed" basis, when industry no longer seeks to inflate demand for their goods (by marketing, encouraging consumerism, and promoting the expiration or obsolescence of goods).  As an example, with our technology incandescent bulbs could be produced with a lifespan of over a decade.  They are not built this way, because it would cut into the profits of bulb manufacturers and threaten their continued existence.  Industrial profit motivations promote material abundance to a degree, but work against abundance beyond that point.

Corporate "power over" is in their relationships with employees, not customers.
McDonald's interest is making profit.  Big Macs are just a means to that end.  I wouldn't expect McDonald's to have a significant armed force, unless Wendy's and Burger King start an arms race or turf war.
I'd appreciate it if you could explain to me why AnCap markets would operate differently than organized crime.  They fight over product, over turf, over shipments.  While the state *is* their primary antagonist, they certainly use a form of military power to protect their profits and supply lines.  They don't outsource that responsibility.
What exactly would be discouraging monied powers from accumulating military might and establishing governments with it, with the mightiest bullying the weaker ones?  This is what governments already do, since international relationships are a form of anarchy.  If you retain hierarchical organizations and enforcement of unilateral decisions, why would they avoid increasing their power and influence as best they can?

You're saying no one's natural rights have been protected by governments?  That's just not the case.  We never have and never will have perfection when it comes to securing rights and administering the law - but we can do a lot better than this.  It's shameful that a country founded in the rhetoric of liberty took until 1964 to adopt real universal suffrage.  (Technically, 1920, but blacks were still being categorically denied the right to vote via bullshit.)
I agree with you that every model of government thus far has been dysfunctional and unjust, but the survival of governments is not a matter of right and wrong.  In the anarchy that is international relations, it's strictly about survival.
So anyways, before I lapse into rambling, what exactly do you think is fundamentally *wrong* with governments as they've existed?  I know my answer to this question, but I'm really curious what you think the central failing is.

I agree.  This is why I'm a minarchist, or libertarian socialist.  There are some excellent functions of authority that simply don't fit in when there are exclusively peer relationships.

Someone has failed miserably at teaching you reading comprehension if you believe I was making that assertion.
Democracy means any form of government that potentially involves the whole population in decisions regarding governance.
It can certainly use a "majority rules" approach, but doesn't need to.

That was Nixon's attitude towards Watergate: "If the president does it, it's not illegal."  Now it's "If political donors do it, it's not illegal."
One of the greatest injustices in the US today is the way certain individuals and business have weaseled their way into legal immunity.
