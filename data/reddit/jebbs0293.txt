I would also agree with darkcoin , looks like it will be the first coin to actually provide anonymity. there are a few in the works promising it but have yet to deliver and we all know being first counts. 
But also Huntercoin. It has a game built into the wallet that you can play that allows you to human mine. First coin of its kind. They are implementing a very smooth game client soon which will attract even more users. including upgrades of the game itself.

If a coin costs 0.01 btc to buy , it's value is 100th of bitcoins, if bitcoin is to rise in value by 50%, that price of 0.01 remains the same, so while the price in relation to btc stays the same, their USD value rises
