The excerpts are from book 'The Sovereign Individual: Mastering the Transition to the Information Age' by James Dale Davidson and‎ William Rees-Mogg.
I am sure some of you have already seen these farsighted statements, or even read the book, but I assumed many of you would appreciate seeing this for the first time like I did. Special thanks to for sharing the link in an other subreddit:
**Some key statements:**
* Based on public-private key encryption
* Characteristics of cybermoney: unique, secure, anonymous, verifiable
* Unlike gold, the new money is divisible, it is easy to send, receive and store
* Impossible to counterfeit
* Multitude of new business opportunities will be created, some of which are based on micropayments
* Legislation will be lagging, but in the end, governments cannot regulate its use
* Near elimination of leverage and inflation in the monetary system
* The new money is likely to rely on marginal transactional fees, which are significantly lower than the current inflation rate
* Major decline in government taxation
* Governments will lose control when they can no longer 1) tax people by inflation, 2) issue new money, 3) reach the new money easily
* Transitional fiscal crisis and social implications are caused by the liabilities of governments, which will be underfunded
* Re-allocation of wealth not by governments (which tend to waste resources, abuse power against own citizens and overuse military to maintain and build empires), but by talented people will lead to improved productivity

I appreciate and thank for this nice gesture, although there is no need to tip me. I am not even the original poster, just wanted to share the content/link, which you guys might find interesting. Please consider buying the book though!

The problem is that Bitcoin does not have privacy at the protocol level. Many people here think Bitcoin will eventually replace the existing FIAT payment systems, but as things are, it will never occur due to the above mentioned points. **Unless** privacy is implemented at the protocol, no wide spread adoption will ensue. This is absolutely guaranteed, no sensible company, wealthy individual or an influential organization would rely on a completely transparent network to handle its financial transactions, which are completely visible to competitors, criminals and even oppressive governments.
Privacy is deeply needed in Bitcoin, and it is one of the biggest obstacles hindering the wide spread adoption in addition to the scalability hurdles, which are being resolved. Privacy at the second layer such as Lightning Network is a good start, but it should be incorporated to the base layer (protocol level) too.

I wouldn't consider average transaction fee cheap when it is &gt;= 1 USD even nowadays. What happens with increased usage? What about the developing countries where the average annual income is not as high as it is in the west?

Reposted because I accidentally deleted the earlier post with my phone.
One issue with LN is the need to interact with the base layer when sending funds to a lightning channel and also the settling at the base. The fees will be astronomical if we even gain 10x the transactions let alone in the theoretical event of hyperbitcoinization.

Some of the associated problems are: hard cap on block size and the ever growing blockchain size even with pruning. A possible solution to combat these issues could be cryptographic accumulators that keep the chain size constant.
