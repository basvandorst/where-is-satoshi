I don't think that would be legal unless there's a specific clause in their ToS.
They introduced segregated wallets because of the FDIC requirement, that every user 'owns' his coins on the blockchain, and not just in Bitfinexes accounting.
In that sense the coins were only stolen from specific people, and there's no reason that other unaffected people at Bitfinex should pay for it.

And if the channel is directly between you and the exchange (a Lightning account), then you don't have to create a deposit or withdrawal address each time you want to move coins in or out.

@_date: 2018-01-09 01:20:34
Yes, that would optimally be an atomic swap. Not sure if that's feasible, particularly across several channels...

I didn't know your article, great analysis.
Yours is much more in depth. I put a link in the comments.
One of my biggest concerns is businesses/exchanges not allowing routing because of regulations, but I think exchanges already have the best position to manage this. Do you agree? Do you know any exchanges opinion on that?
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:26:17
So it's either unregulated exchanges, or you have a direct channel to the exchange and the exchange has you sign a disclaimer that you're not routing other people's money.
If businesses don't get involved then i don't see it taking off (as in mass adoption) at all. Do you?
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:12:45
First, withdrawing to a lighting channel is safer than a hot wallet, since both the customer and exchange need to sign balance changes.
Second, exchanges would have turned into money transmitters when they start connecting, so that's assuming they earn more from transaction fees than trades.
Also, once a few exchanges are connected the others will have to follow, or else they're much less attractive.
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:47:43
Even if they don't want to do routing initially, they and their customers have a security advantage by offering "lightning accounts".
Customers can safely hodl their coins on their side of the channel, and move them on the exchange's side in an instant if they want to make a trade.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:23:44
Actually exchanges having LN channels takes away from their centralized power, and govs power. That's because the coins can be hodled outside the exchange, and only moved in quickly, cheaply, for trading.

In principle a first party only needs contracts with the parties that it's directly in contact with. If those parties break the contract, and let illegitimate money enter the system (or the third parties that they're connected to, etc) then it's their fault, not the first parties fault.
That's the way it works with banks today. Main difference is that LN is much faster and the transactions aren't necessarily logged.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:20:36
For most illegitimate money the banks today also don't know when it's passing through them, because the owners set up companies in Panama to provide anonymity for them.
Main difference is that with LN that process is automatic.
I'm not saying that LN as it's implemented today will gain mass adoption, but *if* it does, it will be through exchanges, or new companies very similar to exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:38:21
Agree with that. The main question for LN short term benefit is what percentage of transactions is between long-term, repeat partners, those could benefit right now by opening a 1-1 channel.

Routing works similarity to the Tor network, so an intermediate node does not know where the funds are going.
So, the only censorship that could happen is if no node in the network opens a channel with you or the party you want to pay.

I don't think a block size increase in Bitcoin is realistic within a year. It's been discussed for four years now, and this year has seen most defenders switch over to other coins. As far as I know, there's no approach under discussion or even being implemented.
I have accepted that Bitcoin is going the small block way, looking for other solutions first (LN, sidechains). Other cryptos are trying big blocks first, and will look for other solutions later.
Cryptocurrency-competition will show, which approach works best in the long term. I find both approaches have pros and cons, and I have shifted my investment according to my preference between the two approaches.

Is there an API for how a LN user can establish a channel with a LN liquidity provider, to determine the specs and fees of the channel to be established?
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:18:07
Miners could certainly try to manipulate, but it would cost them fees. Also neutral miners would automatically counteract, because they mine high fees first.
As for the 'very rich people' having undue influence. The market price is very similar to proof of stake, because if you buy or sell double the amount of bitcoin you also have double the effect on the price. The main difference is, that a proof of stake vote can take place before implementing a ruleset change, but for a 'market vote' you have to fork first.
As for exchanges voting with other peoples coins, I don't see a big problem there. Their users can move their coins if they disagree, or exchanges can hold internal votes and signal accordingly. It's the same thing as with mining pools and miners.
The existing activation mechanism has pitted miners against a big part of the users and developers. If you will you could consider those votes a tool of communication. The only alternative to communicating is forking, which I'm not that opposed to, as long as it's a clean bilateral fork. But waiting for another half a year, just to have nothing happen (neither Segwit nor BU), seems like a waste of time. And half a year is a lot of time in the cryptocurrency space.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:36:11
Sorry, wrong place for that comment. I moved it to 
But to answer your question. In either scenario an exchange holds the private keys, or sends the transactions. So, technically, it's up to the exchange what it signals.
If a user doesn't like, how his exchange votes, he could move away his coins. Alternatively, an exchange could hold an internal vote, and signal accordingly.
It's exactly the same as with hash pools and their miners.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:21:12
Why not base UASF on any kind of reliable voting?
We know node count is relatively cheap to fake, I guess that's why it's not in this proposal. But there's proof of stake and proof of block space.
Proof of stake: Nobody seems to talking about that, maybe because Roger Ver holds large amounts of Bitcoin. But say he owns 300k bitcoins, then that's still just ~2% of the total vote, big exchanges have a bitcoin reserve of comparable size. I think that would be the best way to gauge economic success/approval of rule changes.
Proof of block space: Since blocks are mostly full, block space is scarce and costly (looking at fees it's in the thousands of dollars). Hence transaction flags could be used to vote for proposals, and the weight of a vote equals it's size (in bytes). This would be a vote by the entities using Bitcoin as a means of value exchange.

In my opinion the definition of "legitimate use" is the most crucial part hear. Can you define what's a legitimate use/transaction for you, and how you know that only 750k is used for those uses/transactions (with reference if possible).
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:32:20
He probably still holds a large amount of bitcoins and thinks BU is a good way to scale and thereby increase their value (BU as strategy, can't imagine he's a fan of the buggy implementation). Would make sense, since he has been supporting bigger blocks for a long time now.
I think that's much more probable than those other conspiracy theory answers, apparently some brains go haywire when they try to process acronyms.
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:13:18
Thanks for answering.
With this definition buying coffee with bitcoin would be a legitimate use. But, clearly, blocks are too small for this use case (if we desire more than 10k users), as it's priced out by the fees. So in that sense blocks are too small for legitimate uses.
There clearly is a trade-off between having low-value transactions and having higher security/less centralisation. I think it would strengthen your credibility to be up-front about that.

Yes, this split will require additional effort for withdrawals and deposits. But at least establishing separate withdrawal accounts should be easy with opt-in replay protection. For deposits they'll have to inform the customer of how to deal with replay, or allow double-chain deposits, e.g. depositing both fork coins to the same address.
But allowing people that had deposited BTC before the fork to trade both forked coins is very easy. Don't understand why they're not going for those transaction fees...

Doesn't that just mean that it's still a soft fork, but with the condition that instead of 51% of miners needing to adopt, we need 67% of miners to adopt to make sure that the forked chain wins.

I'm talking about percentages of miners that are required to make sure a softfork, once activated, produces the longest chain. In the usual case, 51% is enough.
In the case where difficulty is artificially twice as high for the soft-forkers, they will have to work twice as hard to form a longer chain than the non-forkers (or attackers), hence 67%.
This means if 95% mine the soft-fork, an attack wouldn't be feasible in my example.

You call it fucked, other people call it logarithmic

Replay is relevant to anyone who owns coins before the split:
After an initial split miners will adjust to the economic support. So let's assume the economic support is split is 95% vs 5%. If I own 10'000$ in BTC before the split I'll own 9'500$ of BTCa and 500$ of BTCb. So both BTC versions are still relevant to me and I don't want my transactions replayed.

When buying that many bitcoin you should place a limit order to prevent influencing the price by buying out the order book.
Then you wait for the order to be filled. If the price moves up you'll have to adjust your limit.
That's much less hassle than buying 1 coin at a time.

So they're depositing/gifting cash for you somewhere and then you're supposed to buy bitcoin with it?
If it's a gift, why can't you just do with the money what you want, instead of specifically buying bitcoin.
I don't get what's going on.
Like you say, if they have bitcoin now it would be the easiest thing to create a wallet for you and send the bitcoin there. No need for cash to be involved in any way, that's sort of the point of bitcoin.
