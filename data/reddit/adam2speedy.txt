That's a problem, not a good thing. BTC isn't used as a currency because everyone figures they can hold onto it and become richer. Inflation encourages spending which allows the economy to go round.
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:38:47


That is entirely speculative.

That 10,000% return is only possible with absolute mania and delusion in a market. The rules that govern finance are no different in any market place, whether it be cryptos, stocks, or bonds.

Same, except I literally have a bet with my friend.

99% of the people here are impulsive, uninformed, and have little understanding of economics.

Mainly because the population, and hence, land and home prices, was much lower.

Comments like these make me afraid that bitcoin is going to pop. You literally sound delusional.

How is holding fiat stressful, when it is much more stable?

gambled the 1k his grandma gave him for COLLEGE on crypto without her permission, became a millionaire, and now acts like a arrogant prick and like he is some sort of "genius" for getting lucky as fuck.

Dow down 4% Bitcoin down more than 50%. Wtf are you talking about?

You should probably seek a financial advisor and invest in income producing assets then...

"The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent." Just because you think something is a bubble, doesn't mean you should short it.
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:18:33
The amount of people using bitcoin for purchases is extremely small, and they are doing it for the novelty of it as opposed to for convenience sake. It has no utility.

You don't have to read minds to understand sarcasm. You just have to not be autistic.

That is idiotic and misleading.

I also explain that 20% YoY is not even sustainable, and there are PLENTY who think that is.

Holy hell do you have aspergers? You seem like a socially unaware prick.
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:56:57
It didn't drop 4% in a day you retard. It dropped 2% today, and 4% over the week. The stock market is still up 3% since january fucking 1st. Also, you clearly know nothing about finance if you profess that it's been "expected to crash for years now" and is "overdue." 10-year treasury yields and interest rate increases that have caused this pullback in the first place. All you worthless banshees are capable of doing is screeching "HODL" like the autistic fucks you are, enjoy hodling your worthless shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:56:53
I'm pretty sure you're the stupid one for not noticing obvious sarcasm.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:40:10
It has no utility or inherent value other than it's perceived value. The mania is dying, and with it bitcoin's price.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:42:29
That's called luck.
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:35:14


Not at all, no one does. Not sustainable doesn't mean that it is a bubble, it just means that returns will slow. The economy is in full gear with inflation, employment, and interest rates all at perfect levels, for now at least.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:12:38
You know what else makes national news? Internet companies during the dot com bubble with virtually no revenue. Bitcoin is a bubble and it's already popping.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:10:58
Yes, it is textbook stuff. Call it a bubble and fraud and once people finally realize it is, the price comes crashing down. That is indeed how a bubble works.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:48:12
You literally deleted your comment out of embarrassment because it was mass-downvoted. Everyone else noticed the sarcasm except for you, now go and be a snowflake somewhere else please.

Stocks don't need shills because they have a track record of over a hundred years as a stable financial instrument.

If you think that 800% YoY is even remotely sustainable, here is some food for thought.
If you invest $1,000 at a 800% interest rate for 10 years it will turn into $3,486,784,401,000 (3 trillion dollars)

"you have no clue what a un hackable decentralised censorship resistant currency is worth"
It is worth NOTHING. Almost no one is using it as a currency, they are buying it to make money. Also, there isn't anything preventing someone else from making another un hackable decentralised censorship resistant currency, so that doesn't give it any inherent value. There are hundreds of other worthless alt coins that have the exact same utillity. The only reason bitcoin has a higher price then the rest is because of mania and delusion, it is worthless. The fact you get so emotional shows that you are manic about bitcoin. Delusional.
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:15:37
Don't waste your time arguing with this retarded snowflake.
@_date: 2018-04-14 05:14:34
No. Because dollars go DOWN in value instead of up. God damn you crypto kiddies are retarded.
