The only "bookkeeping" I care about is my credit card bill. As long as the charges on my bill reflect the actual purchases I made, I don't give a shit how Amex runs its affairs. If cardholders who carry balances are unhappy with the interest rates it charges,  they can go look for unsecured loans from someone else.

Not at all. Retailers everywhere accept my dollars, so they don't seem to think there's a good reason to not accept dollars.

That's another reason not to spend it. When you pay with bitcoin you are incurring an opportunity cost you do not incur with USD, because you're exchanging an appreciating asset for a depreciating one. 


No. I use them because they give me purchase protection and other benefits, not because I'm trying to impress anyone.

The depreciating asset, since that's going to attract the most customers to my gas station.

American Express is not a bank. And they refunded me the cost of a $500 bed frame, no questions ask, when I filed an accidental damage claim for damage I caused myself. I literally destroyed a brand new bed frame, told amex about it, and got a $500 refund. Not only that, but they let me keep the 500 hotel points I earned on the purchase.

If I'm paying for insurance, that offsets any potential savings I get from using Bitcoin. 
And if retailers are marking down their prices to account for the reduced transaction fees for bitcoins, then that eliminates a major benefit to retailers - they're not actually capturing that savings, because they're passing it on to the customer. I don't know why I should reliably expect retailers to do that.
Finally, 1-2% difference in price is easily worth the benefits I get from using my card. I earn miles and hotel points, and I only use them when the redemption rate exceeds $0.03 per mile. If I'm paying 3% to use the card, but getting $0.035 per mile, I come out $0.005 ahead on that deal. And usually I'm doing better than that. Last year I flew to Eastern Europe with United miles and got a $0.0479 redemption rate.

That's a pareto efficient solution. Those other users must have decided for themselves that the time value of that money exceeded the interest rate, otherwise they would not have borrowed it.  And from their perspective, my good credit history reduces Amex's risk exposure, which allows them to offer more competitive interest rates.

 &gt; The charges to the merchant are paid for by your purchases it effects you, maybe that's worth the benefit to you, but it depends what their fee is to the merchant, and they have total control of that. 
I know what they charge merchants: 2.05%. I already beat that on the redemption rates. I've booked $200 hotels with 3000 Starwood points. That's a $0.066 redemption rate, which means I netted a 4.1% return even if you assume I paid all of Amex's transaction fees.
And like I said earlier, even if the transaction fee for bitcoin is lower, I have no reason to believe the merchant will pass that savings on to me and not keep it for himself. In fact, if the merchant is reducing his prices to account for lower transaction fees, he is eliminating his biggest incentive for accepting bitcoin in the first place. 


If I dispute a charge, the burden shifts to the seller to prove that the charge was legitimate. If I buy a $20 item and it shows up as a $30 charge, I will dispute it. And if the merchant cannot show a receipt or anything that supports that charge, the charge will be invalidated and it will get wiped off my bill. That means that if Amex is putting fraudulent charges on there, that is the MERCHANT'S problem, not mine.


I don't want "final." I want to be able to dispute fraudulent charges and mistakes. I want purchase protection in case the item is defective. I want accidental damage protection in case the item gets broken.

If it is, then I expect retailers will stop accepting it. Yet that doesn't seem to be happening.

And those are precisely the currencies I want to spend. I'll do the math for you:
Suppose I'm buying a $100 item. I have a $100 bill and $100 worth of bitcoins.
If I wait a month, the $100 bill might only by $99 (present value) worth of stuff. That means I effectively lose $1 by holding onto the dollar.
Additionally, in one month my bitcoins will probably be worth at least $101.
By paying for the $100 with dollars, I get rid of my depreciating currency and force the seller to eat the $1 loss.
If I pay with bitcoin, I'm effectively paying $101 for a $100 item.
The math gets even better when you throw credit cards into the mix. If I buy the item with a credit card on February first, but I don't pay off my bill until March 1, then the $100 I pay to the credit card company is actually worth less than it was when I acquired the item. If the value of my dollars fell 1% of the course of that month, I am effectively paying $99 for  a $100 item (or $100 for a $101 item, depending on whether you're looking at the transaction *ex ante* or *ex post*)

If you're buying a tank of gas, and you have a depreciating asset and an appreciating asset you can use as payment, which one would you prefer to pay with?

I just use my credit card. If some hacker gets my credit card number and runs up fraudulent charges, I call the credit card company and they wipe the charges.

No, I actually don't. My credit cards are all set up to automatically deduct the full balance from my bank account on the due date, so I never pay interest.

I went to the credit card's web site and set up automatic payments. The only way I'm going to "miss a payment" is if the credit card company's billing system fails for some reason, in which case the fault lies with the credit card company and they will eat the cost.
And if the credit card company refuses to own up to its mistake I will contact my state attorney general's consumer protection agency and have the problem rectified. I actually did this once when Wachovia botched an electronic transaction and it worked remarkably well. I ended up on a 3-way phone call with the consumer protection lady and the Wachovia rep, and the Wachovia rep was extremely deferential and fixed everything while we were on the phone.
