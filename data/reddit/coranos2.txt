Great article.
Historically, futures markets have increased volatility of the base asset. At the same time, they also allow users of the asset to buy it at a predictable price.
So if you are going to use bitcoin to actually do something, you don’t have to worry about 50% daily volatility.
For example, if you are using bitcoin to do international cash transfers, this makes it a lot more valuable as you can plan out a schedule of transfers and lock in a price rather than being held to the whims of the market.
If etherium and cryptokitties get futures markets, that will make cat picture trading a lot more businesslike. You could plan ahead and lock in your trading prices and trades so you get your new breeding cat right at the cooldown rather than having to worry about having to buy $300 eth to get the cat you want at the right time.

Good I'm glad you are only talking about Venezuela now.
So you can clearly read that Guaido, as the head of the National Assembly, has the constitutional authority to order an outside military intervention.
Cool. Thank you.
Maduro has the legal means to murder his own people and detain the opposition.
Guaido has the legal means to stop Maduro.
That's it. Everyone else is just spectators.
Acting like Maduro is anything but a murdering dictator bent on destroying the opposition is also super disingenuous. Same thing, different sides, civil war.
@_date: 2019-03-12 18:29:51
So did you look up Article 187 yet?
Or are you just going to mention Elliot Abrams in every single comment?
@_date: 2019-03-13 00:59:12
You have clearly never spoken with an actual Venezuelan.
Amnesty International calls Maduro a murdering dictator.
Venezuela: Hunger, punishment and fear, the formula for repression used by authorities under Nicolás Maduro 
Once again your AMERICAN CENTRIC idea is appalling. You think the world revolves around the united states? What about the 50 other nations who recognize Guaido? Are those all also part of the USA plot?
The opposition is neither wealthy, nor does it represent only 30% of the country. Popular Will is a member of Socialist International. It was specifically created to oppose Chavez's attempt to remove term limits and become a de-facto dictator for life (Something Maduro is revisiting). It got 2/3 of the National Assembly seats in 2015. 
Please city your source which says it is 'of the wealthy'.
You say"for the record" and I don't see you backing up a single opinion of yours by facts.
So please, cite your source where Guaido has done anything close to murdering 9000 people. Where his supporters are wealthy.
Also please refrain from dragging the united states into this, it makes you look like a american centric gringo .
Only thing america's done so far was Marc Rubio consistently getting the news wrong. He called the dam "German Dam", the name of the reporter not the dam that malfunctioned. He also said the humanitarian aid was "burned by the police" when it was a molotov coctail thrown by a masked man towards the police (really bad aim, probably started a war).
@_date: 2019-03-19 12:55:02
You can google the looting too. It was crazy.
One store was being looted, and the looters brought a truck.
Then another group of looters stole the tires off the truck of the first group.
The police did nothing but took pictures, and then arrested ~400 people when the power came on.
Now that I’m googling it, the truck may have just been on site. It was a Pepsi plant.
@_date: 2019-03-12 22:13:29
I’m just reading the constitution to you.
If you think the Venezuelan constitution is ‘regime change propaganda’ maybe I should quote the onion article instead ‘cia replaces entire population of Venezuela with pro-us citizens’.
You seem to think this problem started recently, with your spooky man, and a spooky story.
You can’t get it through your head that the opposition party and the people of Venezuela want a dictator removed from their own government.
Your USA centered view is appalling.

Literally just scanned your comment for Elliot Abrams death squads, and there it is.
Please familiarize yourself with the Venezuelan constitution and maduro’s anti constitutional activities before assuming the democratically elected opposition is anything else.
The National Assembly also has the power to authorize an invasion. You can look it up. Or I can link it to you off you can’t be assed to google it.

The cell towers lasted the duration of the 7 day outage. Probably had generators as well, and weren’t looted like the stores.
I maintained contact with 10 Venezuelans through the outage, in 10 different provinces, on purpose, so work back from that.
The last to get power restored was on the coast next to Aruba. 
@_date: 2019-11-20 02:29:29
This would be a pointless exercise.
If the coins are lost, they never add another TX, so they are sunk cost.
If the coins are not lost, then you just stole them.
If I were the one to do it, I would allow all unspent transactions to be reversed (the sig for the input to the TX can be used to sign the UTXO after 500,000 blocks) so you can recover burned coins.
I only know of 40 burned transactions so far, but the people were really pissed when it happened ;c
@_date: 2019-11-20 03:40:29
You can stop the reversal easily, just send the utxo to yourself. Can't be reversed, as it's specifically a coin-burn-oopsie reversal. Also as soon as you spend any of it, you own the tx and the utxo, so it can't be reversed.
You may not know, i made a lot of hardware wallet apps for ledger, and there was a fair amount of coin burn due to buggy .. something. 
Ghosting 10 year old transactions is theft too. So while we're talking about thievery, i figured I'd propose a more useful one.
If you want privacy, go back in time 10 years and implement Monero instead of Bitcoin. You can't erase 10 years of transactions just by removing the utxos from the blockchain. Someone already has a record.

The cellular network was active during the blackout.
Buying with crypto, bolivars, or usd was the only way to buy anything.
All the banks were closed and the employees told to stay at home.
Prices were triple, and there was mass looting (followed by mass arrests)

The Cell towers had battery and generator backup.
I had several Venezuelans pop into discord to say hi, say they were alive, and do some crypto trading.

In late 2017 and early 2018 the ledger nano s would sometimes send out a wrong public key. The public key would not correspond to the private key, so the signature for the block created to spend the coins would get rejected.
To repeat:  
They would send to a public key, fine.  
They would go to spend, tx rejected.  
This bug went away sometime in 2018.
So I have about 100 people who would love to get their coins back.  Eth, xrp, btc, neo, all had at least one buggy address. But since all of it is 90% down, it’s not really worth it to pursue.
The error rate is near ‘cosmic ray’ level something like a million to one.
I have the list in GitHub somewhere if there is interest in fixing it.

The transaction fees will eventually go up on all coins that have a blockchain that is rate limited. 
Your choice is either to store terabytes of historical transactions with an unlimited block size, or have people pay for space.
I'd imagine eventually a coin will come out that does historical transaction squashing and an unlimited number of transactions per minute.

If a 6 year hospital stay costs 8 million usd, 31 satoshis, and the min tx fee is 1 satoshi, it will cost him 1.2 million USD in capital gains to pay the bill and 300,000 usd tx fee.

To use an extreme example, Venezuela. If you held cash, you would have a dime for every million dollars you had in 2000. So in that case, corporate bonds would be a good investment.
It's like shitcoins. The IPO holders are screwed, sure. But since the coins are down 90%, what are the odds they will all stay down 90%?
@_date: 2019-09-12 19:02:07
ah ok. just another bitcoin maximalist :)
@_date: 2019-09-23 14:42:34
You and I are probably going to have an argument.
first one: Where's the cash part of bitcoin? It's all electronic.
second one: Bitcoin has the same problem as junk bonds. Or rather the crypto market, as Bitcoin is just the dominant coin in the market.
In a cashless society, every government has a Tether equivalent, and can print money just by updating a number in the database. This means the government can screw over it's own people extremely easily, by making the money worthless.
in the crypto market, people try to make junk bitcoin clones all the time.
So it sounds like the IMF thinks 'being able to devalue your currency instantly, to save the government at the expense of the people' is a good thing, where I think it is a bad thing.
@_date: 2019-09-10 22:19:19
