the major problem with this version of bitcoin is that they see a 3rd party as a "solution" and not an "option" to holding bitcoins. I will decide my own "solution" to holding my bitcoins but thanks anyway buddy

So your wallet is showing you have 0.433? if that's the case forget Multibit and create a paper wallet at bitaddress.org, write down and/or copy the private key and don't lose it, send the 0.433 to that wallet. never trust any wallet or exchange that store your money for you, if you don't have the private key it's a matter of time before you lose it all. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:51:37
When creating a paper wallet it can be easily encrypted with bip38. With seed or HD wallets it's not so easy. Why is it hard to find your seed if it's encrypted? I thought it just takes a password.

bitcoin is still a new technology. credit cards and banks are electronic cash just like bitcoin. one difference is no one in the world with an internet connection is excluded from using bitcoin. where there is demand there is supply and if people want bitcoin insurance, someone will sell it.
@_date: 2014-04-25 12:36:07
bitcoins are not stored in a wallet or anywhere else, your wallet contains your private key which gives you permission to spend bitcoins. understanding this has major implications for using proper security measures.
@_date: 2014-04-08 12:22:36
you said you can still see the btc in your multibit wallet?
have you tried sending the entire amount in your wallet to a paper wallet? you can make a paper wallet at bitaddress.org, copy the private key and don't lose it, print it in case your computer dies, then send everything to that public key, multibit should send the coins from the temporary address to that paper wallet, giving you control of your coins again. you can download bitcoin qt and import your private key so you can spend your coins again.

Bitcoin is essentially some numbers and letters on a piece of paper. Research private and public keys. Check out bitaddress.org. Bitcoin doesn't require any 3rd party to hold them for you. Play around with a small amount, move it around, don't be afraid of it, don't stop learning about it.

@_date: 2014-08-27 14:25:44
A paper wallet/private key that's not encrypted will always be vulnerable to being physically stolen, hacked, lost or copied.  BIP38 is basically your private key that requires a password to send or spend your coins. It also allows you to make many copies of the key without worry since a password is required to use the coins.
@_date: 2014-12-15 01:10:44
You could also store your password on paper using cipher. For example print out 5 pages of random letters and numbers and make a system for finding your bip38 passphrase.
@_date: 2014-11-11 22:04:49

The almighty secure god wallet is a paper wallet. Print several encrypted private keys and put that in your pocket. Make some copies and leave those in different places.

@_date: 2014-12-18 00:36:17
This is what I do to remember my passphrase. Print out a few pages of random characters. Make as many copies of this as you will have bip38 paper wallet copies. Choose a passphrase from the random characters that are printed but use a unique cipher so that only you know how to find the passphrase. If your paranoid about forgeting your system, unlock one of your empty bip38 addresses every x amount of time so that you will learn it for sure.

You don't have to follow any of these rules to protect your bitcoins. The only thing you have to understand is how private keys work. In theory you could generate an address at bitaddress.org, write down the public and private key on a piece of paper and you're done. Just know that if someone finds your private key they can steal your bitcoins.

The answer is always now but always expect a 50% drop after you buy.

Because bitcoin is easy to use and now nurses are also the billing department.

You are a bitcoin master and will not be forgotten 
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:12:39
You have more bitcoin than 99% of people.

Look how smart I am I bought the dip! Look around you, no one knows what bitcoin is, you don’t need a dip to buy unless you have low self esteem.
@_date: 2019-02-25 15:29:07
That's because you probably weren't alive yet.

Did you sell your bitcoin cash?

You guys are all delusional and the only reason you care about BTC and not BCH is because you have money in BTC. There’s no such thing as a right bitcoin.

Got it. I just keep the bulk of my coins on paper in multiple locations.
@_date: 2017-04-21 12:27:25
I know what you're saying. I keep most of my coins on paper in multiple locations. Why would you use a trezor and not paper?
@_date: 2017-04-30 18:01:23
Multiple copies of your BIP38 encrypted paper wallet in separate locations in case of fire should do the trick. You're right about hardware, it gets lost, damaged and forgotten overtime. 
@_date: 2017-04-21 11:30:17
Why not just use your phone?
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:03:46
Forks should be welcomed, if not it’s another example of old technology preventing new technology because someone is invested.

I am a time traveler from the year 2075. Bitcoin regulation will happen and it will look like your current drug regulations. Like drugs, bitcoin will exist legally and illegally. They will use bitcoin as an excuse to target you because most people have used bitcoin by 2075. I have also traveled to 2140 and using bitcoin in some states is punishable by death. I will give you this advice, keep your bitcoins safe and do not sell them. You're welcome.
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:01:30
Let me try. This private key is probably worth $100.

There should be a site where anyone can fork bitcoin if they want. The market will take care of the rest.

@_date: 2017-10-29 21:06:44
because you didn't buy enough 
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:43:18
It doesn’t matter how many times bitcoin gets forked just like it doesn’t matter how many alt coins there are. Bitcoin will always be bitcoin. Every fork makes bitcoin stronger.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:09:55
For a dollar you can get about 17,000 satoshis if anyone cares

What's with this us vs them attitude? It's a fork/alt coin, who cares? Use the crypto  you want and stop treating numbers like a god you can't escape. Eventually you will be the old man ranting about walking 6 miles in the snow to the nearest bitcoin machine. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:33:07
Who cares about crypto opinions? The market will decide everything.

Before the fork and also be in control of your private keys. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:12:06
Yeah when it went to 500$ it was way too expensive to add to my position.

bitcoin "the internet of money" should have no fee or half a penny or less. bitcoin used to be cool when the fee was 3 cents. when it got to 20 cents I stopped using it and am just holding hoping they fix this

Sometimes you just have to say fuck it. You'll be dead in 80 summers or less.

unless you have like 50,000 bitcoins why are you selling? this thing could easily be $10,000 for 1 and would still be in early adoption 
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:57:34
Most good wallets have "watch only" modes that show you the balance of any public key you want, you can also label them. I use blockchain.info

I waited for 300 when it was 600. Still waiting...
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:58:18
When you print your paper wallet, print many addresses so it's still the same paper wallet when moving coins back into it. Just don't use the addresses with private keys already used.
@_date: 2017-05-01 15:33:25
Is anyone else waiting for some site to get hacked before adding to their position?
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:12:17
It will go to 2200 then back down to 1500 and some article will come out titled "bitcoin is dead"
@_date: 2017-05-04 16:59:53
at 0.00000001 fees are paid in hugs, I'm sure it's in the white paper somewhere

Paper wallets with BIP38 are secure but not user friendly. HD wallets are user friendly but not secure if someone finds my 12 word seed. One string of "gibberish" with a password would be great. Anything like this in the works?

I have a paper wallet but don't want to touch it before or after the split for a while, what will I have to do later to spend them?

go to bitaddress.org, create address, copy your keys somewhere, show the public one to the person watching you juggle
