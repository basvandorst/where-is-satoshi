How do I use 2 factor authorization?

Can you explain this a bit?

Aside from keyloggers, isn't using HTTPS basically the same thing? I'm a little skeptical about installing another extention mainly because having too many extentions makes your browser more unique, which I want to avoid.

It just seems very unlikely that anyone could be put in a poition to edit a site's Javascript code. Although I could be wrong. 
@_date: 2013-02-21 00:31:06
Everyone keeps saying that the addon is where the Javascript is being loaded from when you visit the site, and you're saying that it simply checks the site's JS. Which is it? I'm a little confused.

I think the "Plan B" would be a turn off to some.

Also, I sent you guys an email earlier this month, but try looking into [Violin Memory](

How would a hacker go about doing that? (Obviously not trying to hack them, just curious) Wouldn't they need access to their servers and manually replace their javascript code? That seem close to impossible. 
@_date: 2013-02-20 19:59:02
Thank you, I understand that now. But my question now is, is that even remotely possible? I'm not good when it comes to Networking, but that does seem *very* unlikely, for a hacker to swap out the Javascript the Servers hand out to the clients. Am I wrong to assume this?

Is there a version of the 2nd addon you provided for Firefox? I currently have [this]( one. 
EDIT: I just installed another add-on and now I have two. One of which is called My Wallet 1.4 made by Qkos Services Ltd, and the other one is called My Wallet 1.9 made by Blockchain. ~~Are these the extentions you're refering to?~~ Apparently both of the extentions you provided are by Blockchain, so I removed the extention by Qkos Services Ltd.

Aren't there ways that involve going to a local store, like a CVS or Walgreens?

Every regulator thinks their regulation is "sensible". So finding exactly what is sensible is the real challenge. I'm sure the more bitcoin developes, the less need there will be for regulation against scam sites. Because more and more real world vendors will see the value in accepting bitcoins through one of their sites.
