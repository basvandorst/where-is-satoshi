Bitcoin is technically just a text on a ledger saying certain number key owns certain number of bitcoins. It's like writing down in a piece of paper a number. It is not valuable then. If you cash out or buy something so that it comes into the economy, then it means it has monetary value so you'll have to pay taxes.

I read in your comments section that lighting wallet isn't supported in Venezuela. It seems to me that you're using a centralised solution.

In india, when the indian government declared that 500 &amp; 1000Rs notes were now not legal tender, they still held value and were used for about an year before these notes stopped making the rounds of the market. Although it started to be used at 20% less value. So if you had 1000Rs note, you could still buy stiff for 800Rs with it. Money just doesn't have value because government says so. It also has value because people value it.

Idid a complete sync on my laptop tht has a sata hdd &amp; intel pentium processor connected to a fibre optic internet connection making sure it wasn't the bottleneck. It took about 2 weeks for a complete sync. Doing the same on an i5 laptop with hdd+ssd combination took 2 days. So the processor and hard disk both cause the bottlenecks.

I hate that word. What's a 'glitch' anyway. Programmers don't code with glitches in them. Someone messes up something manually.

What's that? 
@_date: 2018-06-27 05:44:52
Sure. But it'll cost you. Creating full nodes mean that you'll have to store entire block chains for every node and enough processing power to verify every transaction at every node. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 10:43:31
Then its just a single node. Having multiple nodes mean having multiple devices with independent storage and validating capacity along with individual IP addresses. If its all the same, its a single node.

I think it's not easy to setup multiple nodes behind a single IP. They all would compete for the same ports and only one would be able to get through. It is possible to create nodes that only accept data and not share to the network via port forwarding but that misses the point of having multiple nodes.
It is possible to create a system with a single node behind multiple IPs. Basically, all would share the same blockchain and represent themselves as unique nodes on the network. There is very little to gain through this though. If you are hosting an honest node, there is no point in buying multiple IPs. One is enough. If you are trying to attack the network with invalid blocks and transactions, remember that there are other fully validating nodes on the network that will immediately catch on to your malice and block your IP they will also not send your IP as a node to other nodes so your attempt at attacking the network stops within a few nodes connecting to you. If you have a block of IP addresses and all of them are trying to spam the network, all of the genuine nodes will start to block the entire block of your IP addresses. All this will happen without any central authority because every full node is the absolute authority.
It is very difficult to attack the network by spinning up full nodes. It is easier to attack crypto using excessive hash rate from NiceHash. (Check out electroneum's fluctuating difficulty post fork).

Indians are. Government isn't. You have to understand that the people who are currently paying a premium to buy bitcoin are the people who have money and are afraid of government either taking it away, banning the currency notes or just plain devaluing. In the recent times, the amount of black money in swiss banks has also grown considerably. So yes Bitcoin has become a sweet haven to save the money. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 10:48:10
That'll actually work for a while. Until other nodes start to catch on to your nodes misbehaviour and start blocking the IP addresses one by one. You see, every node is self validating so it'll see that your nodes are sending invalid transactions. You could actually start a separate chain with valid blocks and valid transactions but if the blocks are of lower difficulty that the genuine network blocks, other nodes will prefer to use the genuine blocks.

Power plant running with steam requires boiling water to 300°C. Running a graphics card beyond 80°C all the time is insanity. You would require a liquid that boils at or below 60°C to make it work. The system would have to be a closed loop liquid system because such a liquid is expensive. Also, heat in itself is incapable of doing work. It needs another material that is cooler so that the heat can get transferred. So you would need a cooling system for your liquid which requires more energy than it produced is the first place. It is just better to use the raw heat to your advantage than going through with a lot of expense and pain to obtain negligible returns.

I see. I understand what you're saying. Since governments are forcing its citizens to use only particular financial institutions and you'd be branded terrorist if you use any other cheaper financial system, people either pay up high fee or shouldn't sent money back home at all lest they risk branded a criminal. Unfortunately, they have to send money back home and those who haven't lived their lives won't understand the pain of expensive remittance.

Indian here. The government did try a lot to bring the unbanked to the banking sector. With 0 fee accounts and life insurance at about 1rupee per month, all noble causes. But then they wanted everyone to stop using cash &amp; start using digital payments &amp; that ain't happening. Sure the amount of digital payments increased drastically after demonetization, but cash starvation almost killed many markets. Markets gained momentum only when cash started flowing more into these markets. Government forgets that cash is the ultimate peer to peer, fungible currency.

So taking cash is more profitable. Then if some customer does a chargeback, that is a further loss. Sure it's good for customers but definitely not for shop owners. Also no privacy. Big brother is always watching.

He has done a lot of good for the state of Gujarat where he was the chief minister for a long time. My native place is over there and compared to Mumbai which is considered to be an economic capital of India, Gujarat has done a lot of development. Opposition parties hate him due to his ideologies mainly. I'm a fan of this guy for what he does but before everyone judges me, I'd like to say that I don't always agree with what he says example demonetization. But still a guy with strong morals. India has hope only if Mr. Modi is able to steer it in right direction. Hopefully they allow cryptocurrency to be used in India legally.

Bigger blocks mean normal people won't be able to host a complete bitcoin node, leading to centralized network. Agreed that when all bitcoins are mined, there will only be fee to incentivize the miners. But increasing the block size is not a good solution. You are also forgetting lightning network. Offchain transactions are going to be huge in the future which means that block size increase isn't needed as much. Also, if people use lightning network heavily, node owners can afford to pay higher fees on the main bitcoin blockchain.
Infinite issuance of bitcoins is a very bad idea. Reason why people hold bitcoins and not Fiat currency is because the former is rare. We already have doge coin as infinite issuance coin. You can keep an eye on it to see how it goes. But essentially, no one wants to hold it for long. Holding/savings is compared to hoarding in the west, but in the east, it is considered to be a virtue.

Too many allegations so let me break it down for anyone interested.
* What you call being blindsided, I call ability to remember the past more than just a few months. I'm assuming you're from India so tell me how was Congress doing before 2014. Do you even remember the number of Zeros in the scams they did? I literally learnt what billion &amp; trillion was by reading congress scandals.
* Also, agreed the GST was a total disaster. Government was never good at Information Technology and they launched a service that wasn't capable of handling such a huge load of transactions. But I'm hoping you don't think Modi was typing away on his computer building the software for GST. It is a technical problem and the people who built it and tested it and approved it should be fired. And bring in some good Devs, increase the server farm capacity, improve the management &amp; improve the system.
* According to leading news articles, it took banks 7 years to find out about Nirav Modi scam. Tell me was Narendra Modi Prime minister then? I don't think it was because of him that the scam was exposed. But it wasn't Narendra Modi that facilitated the scam either. Just blatantly blaming him for something he couldn't have possibly done just shows pure hate against him.
* I am a Bhakt BTW. Bhakt of my country which is why I'm still here and trying to promote and support Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency even after such market uncertainties. I have a vision of development and nothing else. If Narendra Modi someday stops supporting the development, I'll look for someone better than him who can.


I hope you don't think this is a fake news site.

Banks were forced to provide 0 balance accounts to people by the government. I remember banks rejecting my new account request before. But after the government regulation came in called the 'jan dhan yojna', bankers were going out to get people to create new accounts. It did help banks to recapitalize after having billions in NPAs but then they had to pay interests out to everyone so they had to reduce interest rates. This did help a lot of youngsters secure business loans at a very low interest rates and helped people settle themselves. Basically it's not in banks interest to provide accounts to country's poor. It was the government forcing them that they did.

I've read this many times. If it isn't open, the node we run will only take data and not share to other nodes is what I understand. Do you know if it's safe to do so on a regular router?

I feel you man. A few months ago, I got a circular from citibank stating that they'll ban anyone dealing in cryptocurrency. I cut out my citi credit card and closed the bank account the very same day. They are crooks with a banking license and I'm never ever going to deal with them in my life. I hope you got your money back.
Also, do not invest directly in crypto till the regulations are clear and still use cash for crypto. Government now has the ability to monitor every single digital transaction and with some analysis, will definitely come down hard on crypto investors. If you still want to invest, get a small mining rig and convert your electricity to crypto. That way you are also helping securing the chain from the powerful government organizations that might want to destroy using 51%.

Agreed. And in the arms race of cryptography, using a tech is a one off game. As soon as other parties know that a solution exists, the problem changes. It's possible that governments currently have most advanced quantum computers. But using it to double spend bitcoin and break the network is not going to be a high priority. Also, once that is done, the network evolves which means that the systems won't be as useful for high priority applications(think counter terrorism). Which is why there isn't any need to worry about quantum computers any time soon.

Do not sign the petition. Long comment. Do read.
I'm an Indian and am truly disappointed by the decision.
Indian government however is obsessed with tracking each and every action of its citizens like they all are criminals. Buying a phone, prove identity with biometrics. Buying fuel, prove identity. Doing anything these days requires identity.
Government eradicated huge chunk of cash in order to force everyone to the banking sector so everyone could pour money in the banking system and bail out the failing banks. Bitcoin &amp; other cryptocurrencies provide a way out so obviously the government gets worried.
Do not sign any petition. The government is known to release all the email ids of anyone who has signed petitions publicly. Has happened before. Also, signing the petition puts you in grave danger. No one understands bitcoin properly right now and so you can get charged for money laundering if your tax returns aren't in order.
What you can do: keep using bitcoin. Bitcoin provides a way out of the government's control. It was a revolution that we all started. Don't think it will be easy. Use local bitcoins or mine them to obtain bitcoins. Purchase hotel bookings, flight tickets, computer &amp; other stuff from international companies that support bitcoin.
When will things change? : When the government sees that they don't have any control over bitcoin at all. When they see that they have missed a huge opportunity for development and have gone decades back in the past as compared to other countries in terms of technology.  When India suffers terribly by taking the wrong path.
Do not ever disclose if you have any bitcoin. They can't take away your bitcoin but they sure can take away your entire life.
Be craeful. Believe in the tech. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:24:25
Even if they are, it doesn't matter. What technology came out in the form of BTC is truly revolutionary. If some day people find out it was the FEDs and don't want to use BTC, they can leave for thousands of other cryptos. Technology is free, open source and for people who can read the code, it makes a lot of sense.

Listen here. It's not about not paying taxes. Everyone would want to pay tax if it was limited. Once you earn money and till you spetd it, you would be paying 30-60% of it in taxes. You do understand the problem here right? This is why people want to not pay taxes. Its blood sucking.
Also, rich never had to pay much taxes. They always had means to skip tax payments. Now that middle class and poor also can do this is what government is worried about. 
What is hidden however is the secret tax levied which is called inflation. At a rate of 4-7% per year, it steals purchasing power from savers and retired people. In about 10-15 years, half your money is gone in terms of purchasing power. Bitcoin solves this. It provides a way out of this theft. Your money is yours and no one can secretly steal it. It is financial freedom and freedom to own asssets.
Why we get upset is that India isn't the first country to start this policy of taking away financial rights of its citizens. Many have attempted before and every country has gone to the point of starvation. Check Venezuela, Greece, Cyprus etc. If government bans personal right to buy anything that we want, India is going to see a bad future. The rich and powerful always have the means to escape. The poor will be taken hostage where they'll have to eat cockroaches to survive. Because now what they believed in 'paper money' is worthless.
