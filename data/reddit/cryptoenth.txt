How to change to segwit for coins which are on exchange / bitgo ?

That's another theory revolving. Do you think nakamoto is their supreme leader ??

If everyone start thinking same way, then my friend after 4 yrs that beer would sound more like 0 dollars.

Well only after a significant amount of research. I was earlier only into bitcoin, ripple, ethereum. But found few gems to invest in and quite happy to be invested.

No, I think I'll pass.

Yes on email too. I think it's because of current bittrex fiasco. Saw their Twitter handle. Updating my profile with required details.

I had various coins in it . Mostly in ethereum and ripple. Can't see anything now

Opponent, Who ?

I had 2FA enabled. When I logged in it said about verification and stuff.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:19:40
Resolved issue after enhanced verification. Thanks

Bitgo not replying to emails.

Can you please elaborate whats this about ? I could've googled but then I wouldn't be here to ask questions on Reddit. I could've googled that too. Pardon my ignorance. I like learning when people explains me rather than a digitally written text

If all thinks the same way. No one would really be buying btc thus killing the btc you own.

Why do people refer on changing their addresses for security reasons ? Especially in IOTA.

Thanks. Had a look at overview of your website. Looks quite good. I didn't went into details since I know all generic stuff. I am sure you will do good. Cheers
