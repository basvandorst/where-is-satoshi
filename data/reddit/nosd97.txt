Almost 2500 comments; I won't blame you for not delivering OP--not that you'll have to.
But just in case:

I hadn't heard about you until I saw your post. I love the idea of quick cash payments and fast bitcoin transfer. I'm curious, as a one man operation, is your time mostly spent dealing with regulations and governance issues or can you still focus on actually running and developing your business? I'm just wondering how easy it is to be an entrepreneur in the bitcoin exchange space without a team and a bunch of capital.

Depending on the amounts of the transactions, they are required to ask as part of their anti-money laundering compliance. If they are asking so that they can fill out a report to FinCen then they are probably going to file it whether you respond or not, so I'd respond so long as the request isn't overly burdensome. The preceding is not legal advice.

This is correct. Besides traditional securities like stocks, the SEC has jurisdiction over the interstate sale of "investment contracts." An investment contract is an investment of money, that was motivated by an expectation of profits, into a common enterprise where the profits accrue primarily from the efforts of others. This is called the [Howey Test]( from a US Supreme Court case defining the term "Investment Contract" as used in the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts. 
Depending on the details, these mining contracts might fail to be regulated investment contracts on the "common enterprise" or efforts of another elements of the Howey Test. I haven't looked into them, so I couldn't give any real opinion. I just wanted to reiterate that the SEC regulates far more than traditional stocks.
