While license plates are considered "public information" since they are on your publicly driven vehicle, it's still a dick thing to do.  for organizations into stealing high value cars, they often can get name and address through dmv/police records, so once a fresh plate is identified, they have a potential target.  
To gain a better understanding of what people think about their own license plates, look at when people sell cars on CL/ebay; the vast majority of private sellers are hiding the license plates for privacy reasons.

I watched S1, loved it.  After a long period of time tried watching S2, but really couldn't get into it.  I'm guessing I just lost my place and need to restart with S1 all over in order to appreciate S2?

Today I logged in to my coinbase account.  First of all, I couldn't transfer my 1+ BTC without proving my account.  Since they were holding my funds hostage, I conceded, gave them my driver's license.  Then once verified, I transfer my coin into my electrum.  I'm going to do the same with my Ether, then i'm deleting them.  FUCK COINBASE!

keep a low profile, but not too low with the parents.  Spend just enough time in the "household eye" to show them you are making logical and non-drug induced choices.  help out around the house (drug users generally don't).  Keep on your education.  DO NOT tell them about your crypto, and really think and plan hard on how to keep it safe (trusting your parents or best friends is not a good idea).

perspective:  if I rent a room in my house to a roommate and tell them "all utilities included", and then they proceed to rack up a few grand in electricity because they were operating a mining farm out of their closet, there will be hell to pay.  If that was the government, the venezulan government, i'm thinking you'd have a real problem on your hands.
