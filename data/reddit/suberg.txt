maybe, maybe not. But either way, they'll keep an eye on anyone who's running a node and include it in their 'social credit score' in Orwellian fashion and likely dissuade a lot of would-be node operators.

In the context of what Andreas was saying, you're probably right as he was refering to BTC airdrops (Bcash, Stellar, Bitcoin Gold etc.)

Yes. 
"the biggest problem right now is the inability to receive LN payments and make withdrawals from the LN wallet back to the BTC wallet. Therefore, you should only test the LN wallet with a small sum since you will not be able to get the satoshis back to your on-chain Bitcoin wallet (for now).
Software developer Irek Zielinski explains that upcoming versions of Bluewallet will support invoicing, which means bidirectional LN transactions."

'features' are just a novelty alts use to distinguish themselves. Their low userbase and hashpower doesn't make it as secure and immutable as Bitcoin - not to mention they're run as startups for the most part instead of FOSS. 
Not to knock altcoins but they haven't been nearly as battle tested as BTC and will face their own problems if they actually gain any sort of traction.

they've been accepting it since 2014. Contacted them today:
"There is not any news per se, at we have accepted Bitcoins as a payment method for quite some time. :-)
We decided to remove the feature temporarily last year though, because the average transaction time took too long, and the experience wasn't the best.
The problems have since been solved, and we have added the option again. I believe we did so a couple of months ago.
Hungry.dk handle the payment, so you will always be able to use Bitcoins with all the restaurants currently found on Hungry.dk."
