Well, I don't want to reveal any details to them. I consider them thieves.

you are a troll for mtgox. its obvious!

Beware of mt gox. My transfer to Mt Gox NEVER appeared on the account. they do it routinely and hold on to your money under the pretext of verification so beware! They will not return your money. They amassed millions under false pretenses, riding on the bitcoin wave. We need to do a class action suit on them.

I made a transfer from my bank account and after my money was not showing up with them for days I inquired with my bank and was told it is with mtgox. Only after I initiated a support request with mtgox they admitted they had it. By that time I had enough and decided not to use their services and demanded my money back. They are refusing to return it! Hence my beware! :) It is a reasonable to conclusion that I am not the only one in this situation and it may be a basis for a class action.

Idiot's reply with an idiot's opinion. I do international transactions in thousands of dollars just about every week and never had anything of the kind. How much do they pay you to lobby. Maybe I should consider that...nah too much of a two-faced bullshit.

What is bad about that? They are supposed to be a legitimate financial institution. Except that they do not tell you when they receive your money. What do they do with it? Buy bitcoins of course and make money with your money while you keep logging in to your account just to see the zero balance. I had to follow up with my bank to trace the fact that mt gox had my money already for a few days. Meanwhile bitcoin doubled!

Steer away from mt gox!
@_date: 2013-03-27 22:07:03
Yeah, good advice :). Why bother at all if you have to wait while they are playing with your money. What is there to fuck up in the first place?
I am done with them. All I want is my money back.

Why would one try to side with MtGox. They are just about a monopoly in this business and what they need is a close watch not  a crappy propaganda.
@_date: 2013-03-29 07:59:09
Nope. Wrong on both counts :). You then must be one :).
@_date: 2013-03-27 22:03:53
Nope this is not from my other account. I don't have another account. If anyone is trolling it would be you, lobbying for mtgox. Why would they need your defense?
