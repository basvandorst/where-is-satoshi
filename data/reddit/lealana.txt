How was BitGo not hacked if they signed the tx(s) that allowed the theft of 120,000 BTC from bitfinex?
It was utilizing multi-sig. So are you saying if they weren't hacked that BitGo was complicit with the hacker?
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:35:33
liquid funds? the exchange is on their site.
They are essentially God and can create as much BFX$ they want to purchase their debt back.
This whole BFX token is utter horse crap.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:23:17
UNtil it is realized in reality...it is all talk. TALK IS CHEAP
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:26:28
Likely never going to happen.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:36:06
By allowing USD withdrawals in full despite having taken massive losses of customer BTC...is likely going to be a very messy situation moving forward.
Just my two cents.
@_date: 2016-08-10 07:00:47
simple: Institute a 24 HOUR max withdrawal amount. Say 5 BTC per 24 hours lol....now they just turned the herd into slugs.
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:04:40
Cold storage can be a long list of addresses for each customer account, not just  a single address.
@_date: 2016-08-08 19:56:47
Under what circumstances would these tokens be legitimate?
Even if bitfinex created them it would be illegitimate. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 02:24:35
wow you obviously down play the term "Counterparty Risk". 
Anytime you store funds with a 3rd party there is a greater than 0% chance you could lose 100% of your funds.
So your statement is flawed.
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:49:50
how can you say that if Bitgo holds another key they are supposed to be securing for multi-sig?
Where is your proof of this statement as it sounds extra fishy?
@_date: 2016-08-09 07:21:56
wow just wow.
Just wanting to know when people will learn their lesson.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:24:29
Disagree. Customers should come first, then bitfinex....not the other way around.
@_date: 2016-08-08 20:21:25
this is exactly what needs to happen. If not it sets a precedent. 
@_date: 2016-08-24 15:55:44
Privacy comes at a cost, it isn't free. Not surprising that the tx sizes are larger given this added feature. You don't get something for nothing. There are trade-offs.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:33:03
If you didn't want a haircut perhaps leaving your BTC with bitfinex was not the best approach.
People need to consider that there is counter party risk when storing bitcoins with any 3rd party.
That is the name of the game. It's no secret the risk of leaving BTC or USD or LTC or whatever on an exchange...you took a risk...now the reality is Bitfinex is now insolvent and has to be forced into bankruptcy eventually.
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:00:49
yeah only 70% loss in the debt is owed to customers....."not bad"...wow
@_date: 2016-08-08 02:22:38
I suspect Bitfinex will institute daily MAXIMUM withdrawl amounts per 24 hour period. Probably 5-10 BTC per day....just guessing.
They can't survive if everyone pulls out their money at once, very unlikely they will survive a "bank run".
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:24:39
How does anyone know that bitfinex did not stage a hack on their own business?
Someone who wanted to do that would "cooperate". 
Not making accusations, just looking at the facts that it is possible they "hacked" themselves and are not claiming they got hacked.
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:16:57
It may appear that multi-sig (from an average joe's stance) is just as secure as if funds were just in bitfinex's possession.
The idea of multi-sig was to mitigate the risk of having funds stolen due to more pieces to sign the transaction to move the funds.
Wasn't multi-sig recently implemented on bitfinex's end (like last few months). 
Smells fishy...
@_date: 2016-08-08 10:45:42
lol hopefully.
BFX tokens are backed by what? The BFX network?...
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:44:47
they shouldn't even be actively trading it since it is their debt that they have to pay in 100% full. The option to buy their debt at a discount is nonsense.
This is just bitfinex trying to pull a fast one on their customers.
I truly am sorry for all bitfinex customers being taken advantaged of.
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:00:13
Exactly the CFTC is operating as if they are experts in security.
They shouldn't be putting their 2 cents into things which they do not fully understand.
Just because regulators tell you to do something, doesn't mean it is the safest/wisest solution.
@_date: 2016-08-08 10:58:28
The problem is that they shouldn't continue operating. They should be forced into liquidation as they are currently insolvent.
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:03:23
of course...they can't have a run on the "bank". 
Doing it manually can take as long as they want to portray it to take.
Gotta keep the titanic afloat.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:42:08
How do you know if you haven't disclosed the plan to "get money back"?
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:20:16
I guess this goes to show that getting an exchange to prove how they store customer funds in all aspects prior to using them would need to be done.
The other thing is it sounds like centralized exchanges are obsolete....and need to be decentralized in nature to stop this sort of crap from happening.
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:44:24
to be fair it should be a 50% split between bitfinex and BitGo.
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:04:13
agreed. They won't allow a run on their exchange. They are insolvent so they will do anything to delay the inevitable.
@_date: 2016-08-24 15:58:10
How will this differ with the majority of all bitcoins being involved in thefts, hacks, heists?
Once they are black listed then what? The fact that bitcoins can be blacklisted at the socioeconomic level is much more cumbersome as there are direct links proving what coins came from what address (history all the way back to the coin base creation).
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:17:12
The problem with your analogy is that theft from a safety deposit box doesn't imply BANK INSOLVENCY.
IN this case Bitfinex is insolvent if they lost 120k BTC out of 201k BTC...assuming those figures are 100% accurate.
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:21:54
It then pays to spend $1 million on security staff of world class level to secure, design, and implement the best security.
I think they would have been willing to spend $10,000,000 to save $60 to 90 million.
Wow just wow.
@_date: 2016-08-24 16:01:33
And less risky. People should consider the risk of mixing bitcoin with centralized (possibly untrustworthy) mixers.
@_date: 2016-08-24 15:53:28
simple...Monero offers protocol level privacy.
Using a bitcoin mixer is not decentralized enough. In fact most of the time it is centralized (if not all the time).
Monero empowers you and removes that risk of hoping to get your coins back from a mixer.
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:19:06
That is what most average people will think..."multi-sig" is not better than just using a single hot wallet or something similar.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:22:02
"I think Bitfinex will not go bankrupt, and over time everyone will be repaid. "
This is very optimistic ^
Likely very flawed view.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:26:10
Agreed, businesses should RISE AND FALL on their merits....this would constitute a FALL...
Why should they be rewarded by their incompetence in how they secured customer bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-08-10 07:01:49
@_date: 2016-08-22 12:56:57
Use case you forgot: Monero helps to mix bitcoins if one were to choose to do so.
Bitcoin lacks protocol level fungibility between units of bitcoin. Each bitcoin has a unique history that can be traced back to its coinbase creation...
You can't do that with Monero.
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:26:02
Having all funds "secured" in this manner is already a bad sign.
Having some funds secured this way and the rest in separate multi-sig wallets between the core company members whose faces are known would have been better than all your bitcoin in one security setup.
@_date: 2016-08-24 15:59:36
Bitcoin is a speculative investment as well. It is still very young and is to many an experiment. Hard to say one thing about monero  and not have it apply to bitcoin given that bitcoin is still in its infancy.
Go back to the original post about mixing...monero offers something there if you care to take a closer look.
@_date: 2016-08-08 20:20:01
this is just one part of the whole picture.
Utility is the reason bitcoin has value and has a price current today.
@_date: 2016-08-08 10:59:52
This ^ was my thoughts as well. Until Bitfinex actually starts allowing withdrawals...I wouldn't hold my breath.
Talk is cheap.
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:58:25
don't speak too soon...
@_date: 2016-08-24 16:00:27
Decentralized exchanges will likely fix this.
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:58:54
What it goes to show is that the CTFC's requirements are just put into place because  they operate on "telling people what to do". Not telling people what to do which is sound advice.
I've never personally lost any BTC due to a hack/theft while using cold storage wallets.
This bullshit is pathetic. It seems there are so many successful examples of people storing bitcoin offiline securely for years and these fools couldn't do it right.
So broken.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:11:58
THE BOTTOM LINE: All talk is just talk until they actually prove with ACTIONS how much BTC they have and what they plan to do.
TALK IS CHEAP
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:14:18
Somehow I think Bitcoin and insurance dont belong in the same sentence.
Almost like how water and oil doesn't mix.
@_date: 2016-01-08 03:50:26
It just goes to show that there is some major issues with bitcoin when this solution was already implemented long ago in MONERO (XMR)....and only now this solution is coming to the fore front of bitcoin discussion.
I love bitcoin but the political bullshit and the back and forth cry and whining is pretty over done.
@_date: 2015-08-17 03:57:06
This is a case of I'll believe it when I see it (the trustless part).
"Let's use a 3rd party (or 4th, 5th, nth) to transact outside of the bitcoin network in a trustless manner."
Yeah right.
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:32:05
i'm surprised that after 10 hours this thread is still on the top of r/bitcoin.
there needs to be some changes in the moderation policy and users of r/bitcoin.
Censorship goes against everything that is bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-09-01 18:39:11
"Better position than before the indecent"?...
I disagree that is impossible. They can't be better off given how big of a fuck up happened on their watch.
That's like saying MTGOX was better off after its hack in 2011 than before.
@_date: 2015-11-16 10:25:04
"practically" the same?
Your statement is so generalized I'm not even sure what you are getting at. 
The fact that bitcoins can exist in different (identifiable) addresses and each coin has a history all the way back to the coinbase transaction that created those coins ....all bitcoins are essentially NOT FUNGIBLE as you can decipher certain bitcoins from other bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-11-16 10:27:38
Well said.
There are alternative solutions that already do this at the protocol level: MONERO as an example.
It is like a myth that bitcoin is anonymous or bitcoin is private that is much like the myth that bitcoins are fungible.
They are simply not. Until people learn the hard way of having their coins denied to be accepted or seized because there is a certain history associated with certain bitcoins they own, they will continue to believe the myth.
Not all just most. 
Reminds me of when the myth of "the earth is flat" was in style centuries ago.
@_date: 2015-11-21 05:22:50


Fluffy, careful...didn't you say you really don't look at Monero as a "store of value" in one of your talks or podcasts?
Correct me if I am wrong.
@_date: 2015-10-23 09:59:33
Name one way that bitcoin can solve fungibility (in an easy way) with no risk.
Coinjoin? PSSh you can still see transactions
Zero cash/ZKP/Zerocoin? ...nonexistent
Side chains? ....non existent and plagued with many issues of security.
Please tell me one that I have not listed above or if you were thinking of one of those please elaborate why there is "no risk" in which that method solves fungibility with bitcoin 100%.

Instamined coin
Centralized Supply Distribution at start = net positive for dash?
please don't make me laugh harder. lol
Have you personally reviewed the Dash source code in detail to make such claims as "privacy and fungibility"? Or are you just repeating what someone told you?
@_date: 2015-11-09 00:10:59
If the coin that succeeds to overtake Bitcoin is Dash then I would probably stop using cryptocurrency altogether because any large network effect based on a instamined crap coin with 1 main developer is bound to fail.
Please take your shit coin elsewhere. 
@_date: 2015-10-23 10:07:28
LOL wow sounds like a lot of patches you got there to make bitcoin have true "fungibility". Some of those "solutions" do not even exist. Why not just add it to the core protocol...oh wait...nevermind
The devs can't even agree on a single line change to increase the block size. =)
@_date: 2015-10-23 02:55:51
Well said, Mr. brg444 appears to want to turn a blind eye to the topic of fungibility (and therefore privacy) concerning bitcoin. It is something that will either not be dealt with at a protocol level (I doubt it will here) or it will just be dealt with the natural outcomes in this digital age. I tend to think the latter. 
Dont get me wrong I love bitcoin but I will not ignore an issue that is very glaring in contrast to the "block size" debate.
@_date: 2015-10-23 03:00:08
Wrong. There is such a thing as guilty by association. If you are sold or sent coins from a crime such as Murder for hire (for example) you probably will be scrutinized very much so for holding some of those coins associated with that crime.
But what you are saying is that it is okay for a criminal to mix his coins and allow someone to take the heat for his crime?
Sounds like a broken fungibility issue at the core of bitcoin.
Why ignore it and say "its okay" bitcoin is "good enough". Instead of just attempting to fix it or just flat out admitting that bitcoin does indeed have a protocol problem with fungibility and therefore privacy.
@_date: 2015-10-23 10:14:52
Sounds like ignorance to me. Carry on...
@_date: 2015-10-24 08:30:18
I love bitcoin and what it was created to be. But in light of the ability for regulatory authorities to ban or blacklist specific coins that have a certain address history association personally I see bitcoin as losing its fungibility in that respect.
Sure "Bitcoin is not the problem" is one way of looking at it, but other side of the argument is that "why not just fix that issue by disallowing transactions to be tracked by default and just have privacy features on by default?"
We know the answer: Too much opposition to changing the core protocol allow that to happen.
So the argument has those two sides...
SIDE A: Bitcoin is broken via fungibility because one can discriminate some coins to be accepted vs others based on block chain analysis.
SIDE B: Bitcoin is not broken and the financial system and businesses who choose to discriminate certain coins from being spent/exchanged in 3rd party businesses are broken (and the problem).
Two sides and probably both right in their own respect.
Although the arguments and sides exist it doesn't change the fact that businesses/govt/individuals can discriminate from accepting certain coins based on block chain analysis of their respective histories.
We have to remember that bitcoin does exist in this current world no matter how much we disagree with TPTB or the broken legacy monetary system. As long as that type of system exists there will be some issues concerning discriminating against accepting certain coins from certain addresses.
THOUGHT SCENARIO EXERCISE DEALING WITH COIN DISCRIMINATION
This thought experiment is to merely be just that an experiment and is not intended to give people ideas on what to do or not do in certain scenarios 
You are an average joe looking to trade cash for bitcoins or some object like (gold coin) for bitcoins. Assuming you know each of the possible scenarios are true below. 
BOB has bitcoins he wants to trade/exchange with you.
Which scenarios below would you consider not trading with BOB and discriminating against accepting his BTC for payment or trade?
Which scenarios would you trade with BOB and not discriminate against doing a trade?
BOB wants to trade you his BTC is the same person who just:
A. Robbed an old lady of her BTC by ransacking her house then beating the crap out of her.
B. Sold Kiddie porn for BTC
C. Ordered and executed a terrorist attack on a city killing a few hundred people and was paid in BTC to do so
D. Evading taxes with BTC
E. Was paid in BTC for prositution
F. Sold illegal drugs for BTC
Now if you really think about it, people can and will discriminate if they know or suspect something has happened with those BTC.
Would you accept BTC for trade or payment knowing that one of those things happened?
Which ones would you discriminated against more than others?
This brings in different shades of discrimination. As not every person would necessarily pick all of them to discriminate against. Some might even pick all of them to discriminated against. Some possibly would not care.

Andreas A. seems to believe that bitcoin can work on its "fungibility".  ::)
Andreas says: "We need to address the issue of fungibility..."
      ...   he also says:  "the metric of economic inclusion is very much affected by the fungibility and black lists ..."
Dr. Adam Back says in regards to Bitcoin (in Feb 2014) - 
"Weak fungibility: Feature &amp; bug"
"Fungibility provides privacy as a side effect"
"Bitcoin privacy is fragile (Shamir &amp; Dorit network analysis)"
By Dr. Adam Back's definition of fungibility PLUS(+) his statement of "Bitcoin privacy is fragile" you therefore can deduce Dr. Adam Back also believes that Bitcoin's fungibility is also [b]fragile.
@_date: 2015-10-23 03:02:15
And only people use bitcoin. Your point is moot. People/businesses/governments can discriminate. As they are the users of the bitcoin system.
Hence if people discriminate on certain bitcoins that is an issue worth discussing.
@_date: 2015-10-23 03:05:47
You can't have privacy in a currency without fungibility.
QUOTE: "Privacy is the weakest link in censorship resistance. Fungibility is an absolute necessity for any medium of exchange. The properties of money include fungibility. Without privacy you may not be able to have fungibility."
@_date: 2015-10-23 10:12:47
JoinMarket still has transactions that are available to be analyzed, blacklisted, etc. 
Doesn't fix fungibility 100%.
@_date: 2015-10-10 23:38:16
what are your thoughts on Dash/Darkcoin/Whatever it is called?
thanks in advance.
@_date: 2015-10-23 03:13:05
Money needs privacy and thus fungibility as well. Bitcoin is not money it is a digital currency or a digital collectible used as a medium of exchange.
@_date: 2015-10-23 10:00:38
Side chains don't exist.
Can we now move on to things that actually exist?
Oh and you can't transfer value into a SideChain that is not as secure as bitcoin's network AND expect it to retain 100% of its value. It won't be as secure which implies it won't be worth as much as actual bitcoin on the main chain. Nice try though. Even if a SC was merge mined it would not be as secure as main chain because not everyone would switch to supporting merge mining of a sidechain.

@_date: 2015-10-23 03:10:48
Yes there is a difference between money and currency. Bitcoin is a digital collectible acting as a currency (medium of exchange).
Because of its lack of privacy and therefore also lacks in its fungibility it is not money by definition.
