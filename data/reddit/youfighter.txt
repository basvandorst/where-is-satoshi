hey what does hat string of number mean? Is that a code?

Yeah I guess you are right with your rebuttal. But something about having a card in you pocket just feels more "real" then a randomly generated address. But then again it is really just a piece of plastic with a random number on it and that card has a good percentage of my money inside of it. I guess Bitcoins wasn't such a far-fetched idea after all since we were pretty much heading in this direction.

Well umm I wouldn't say that I felt offended by the 200 bit tip I was more curious. I have know about BTC and always wanted some but never could bring myself to exchange the money in my wallet into numbers floating in the magical internet realm. Anyways money is still money. FREE $0.05 WOOH!!!
