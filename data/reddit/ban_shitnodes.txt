I noticed the same. I'm banning with a cronjob and this script:
Works perfect.

It is up to you what you do with it. I found it helpful to temporary ban those bloody Chinese nodes.
@_date: 2018-10-15 19:11:38
I appreciate your concern. But of those not installing the patch, how many you think will execute such a script from a random person from Reddit?
@_date: 2018-10-18 14:23:28
No, as long as one node does not do it it is ok. A lot of people do not even update their node to a version not vulnerable to the DDos attack. So I would not worry about it.
@_date: 2018-10-27 12:16:33
Well, you learnt a lesson that is more valuable than the amount you lost. Try to see it that way.
@_date: 2018-10-25 20:29:43
But what can be done? Is it just a question of how easy it is for non tech sawy people to use bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-10-18 15:25:48
I also made a script to ban by subversions:
With this you can ban specific subversions. But as you mentioned they can easily be spoofed.

Thats like saying "Even a Stopped Clock Is Right Twice a Day"

Wow, thank you for that site!

To ban the country you really hate from your node?

Stupid site links all blocks to btc . com

Anything but that one. How about your own one?
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:25:17
 A ban is just a ban and I believe you can do with your ressources what you want.
@_date: 2018-10-15 19:19:28
Thanks for linking to my post. But the script wasn't meant to be very serious. 
But I noticed that most of the unpatched versions come from Chinese IP addresses. Has anyone else noticed that as well? The most common version is clearly 0.15.1

Just keep waiting. If you choose a small fee it can take time for your transaction to be included into a block by a miner.

Thank you that is very generous!

There is a lot of room for improvement in some well populated countries for example
@_date: 2019-02-25 12:35:41
This problem reminds me of IRC channels. There should be something like a lightning bouncer. Or does that already exist?
@_date: 2019-02-14 12:44:26
You are absolutely right Rellim03! I'm not doing it for the money. I'm experimenting with LN because I think the technology is fascinating and we might be at a start of something very big. 
And I take job offers ;)
@_date: 2019-02-19 19:17:53
Look, I know that is possible but \~ 600 000 transactions a month on a "little node" seems too high for me
@_date: 2019-02-12 09:40:36
That was not when I synchronized the blockchain. That was when I started collecting data. The blockchain is just about \~200GB and not 9TB.
That was because of the mempool size. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 23:12:30
less than 40

Bolwo is right. I use lncli feereport and munin to make the graph.
@_date: 2019-02-19 19:56:23
That is what he is saying in his tweet:  I'm pleasantly surprised that there is now so much activity on Lightning that my own **little** node is now routing more than $10,000/month. I don't have any idea what these transactions are related to. I'm getting paid 0.25% for routing. 
But after checking I wouldn't say 13.81005428 BTC or $54,916.92 is little..
@_date: 2019-02-13 22:49:41
Here you can see the sum of the forwarding fees of my lightning network nodes from october to today. The fees are usually 1 satoshi. In total I got about 35 Satoshis so far. As you can see you should not do it because of the fees if that is what you are up to. I got more from LN tipps from posting here. 
I hope this info helps.
@_date: 2019-02-19 19:49:33
I know that transactions can cost more than 1 sat but you don't pay every node you pass 50-100 sats and that is what routing is no? I mean his node cannot be connected to all 6400 nodes. Maybe he mixed up what he got with routing and what users paid him?
Some proof would be nice.
@_date: 2019-02-19 18:59:00
I call bullshit. How should he get 650 000 satoshis for routing? 
@_date: 2019-02-12 19:08:51
Nah, I probably paid a 3-digit number to run it.
@_date: 2019-02-10 21:21:20
You can get bitcoin core here: [ and you can get help here:

But I would recommend to inform yourself before you start. Some basic knowledge about running a node and networking will make it easier for you.
@_date: 2019-02-12 07:18:34
You can reduce and optimize a lot. I mean you can run it on a raspberry with very little bandwidth. This is just to show what it takes if you don't really limit your node in the settings.
@_date: 2019-02-12 09:50:35
I added the mempool size stats so you can see the correlation of unconfirmed transactions with the bandwidth usage. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 22:05:46
I don't know if that works for you but if you use git just do that:
`cd` [`$GOPATH`]( 
`git fetch --tags` 
`git checkout v0.5.2-beta` 
`make clean &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install` 
@_date: 2019-02-14 13:26:26
It just shows the current day, last 7 days and last 30 (31?) days. You might had some but you didn't realize it.
@_date: 2019-02-16 20:34:16
There has to be a way. Maybe something like a **prepaid** lightning card that you can load with satoshis and then spend. Like with a "cold channel". 
Or why not a computer the size of an actual credit card with lora and rfid? I know that does not exist so far but it would be cool.
@_date: 2019-02-14 12:45:30
Thank you very much that is very generous of you!
@_date: 2019-02-13 23:09:37
What help the network is bandwidth and what hardware you are using.  I would say it is better to have just one full node with 300 connections instead of 10 full nodes with 30 connections each. If you don't have a very good reason to have several nodes just make one powerful node.
@_date: 2019-02-12 06:14:07
I use munin and some scripts I wrote:
@_date: 2019-02-28 13:45:25
Better ? [

Maybe it's better you ask your question in the Bitcointalk mining forum:
If you want my opinion you should rather play real lotto your chances are much higher there.

My theory is that a lot of people that bought last year are now cashing out for the holiday season. The kind of people that just bought it as an investment and doesn't know or care about the technology behind it. But actually

I doubt it. The price would certainly go up in such an event.

Nm now it works.

How long does that take.

The Bitcoin community is just a reflection of the observer. Negative people see negativity, toxic people see toxicity, hard working people see hard work, optimistic people see optimism, traders see trading, trolls see trolling and you see conspiracies. There is something for everyone.

You just need the backup seed. Trezor is good for making safe transactions. Since you won't be doing that until bitcoin will be worth $ 100 000 000 you can either keep it, hoping it will still be working and supported by that time, or just get the latest wallet and enter your seed once you want to spend your coins.

You know how you could really convince your family? By getting a job and earn your own money. This would show them your dedication and you would profit more than from mining. 
Then use the money to buy bitcoin.

From which version did you upgrade? Lower than 0.15.0 ?
