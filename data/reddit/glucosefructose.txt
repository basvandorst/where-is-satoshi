I'm very serious! Thank you for the link! 
@_date: 2019-01-27 05:50:49
I have a place to install - that yes is where you suggest, very high traffic. 
I've found this 
@_date: 2019-01-27 22:37:56
Thank you SO MUCH. Do you mind if we start a private chat? I'm busy right now but I'd love to discuss more with you. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 02:58:31
hah. happy cake day
@_date: 2019-01-28 17:48:04
I'm interested. Can you send photos?
@_date: 2019-01-28 03:00:27
Not one person, not alone, this will be put in a very high traffic high profit store. (30k-60k daily sales). No rent

Send the BTC to a wallet and not cash it into Dollars etc.

I have experience with Bitcoin - Not with Bitcoin ATMs. My family member already had wanted to do it, he just had a newborn and doesn't have time to do the leg work. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 05:14:32
Absolutely it was a good question (People think I'm falling for a scam) 
I've gotten some good information so far! 
@_date: 2019-01-28 02:59:10
Already got one scheduled
@_date: 2019-01-27 04:52:30
Of course not - I do not have money in hand. 
A family member is funding the project,  I'm doing the legwork. 
Edit: The ATM will be placed in a very high traffic store. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 04:51:15
Thanks so much for the answer! 
I promise I'm not trolling as another user suggested. A family member owns a business that brings in 30-60k a day and it will be put in this location. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 02:56:14
haha he was =p 
@_date: 2019-01-28 02:57:27
I did - I actually wanted to do this - But my financier did not want that. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 02:58:18
Likely starting with a one way 
@_date: 2019-01-27 04:49:25
Why? My city does not have one, the only major city in Texas I believe without one. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 05:20:53
I sent you a PM
@_date: 2019-01-27 22:46:43
I sent you a private chat! 
I found a machine I think will work starting out - it's only a one way I linked it in the chat 
@_date: 2019-01-27 07:07:16
You're right - But it's a good start. 
I'm looking at this machine right now
@_date: 2019-01-28 02:59:37
The budget will likely go up when I show him how much I've been working on the project. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 07:10:27
Can't tell if you're being sarcastic. but I'm totally fucking doing it
@_date: 2019-01-27 04:43:40
I'm going to... I asked the best defense attorney in town for a suggestion and even he didn't have any idea other than a tax attorney. Does anyone else have more info? 
@_date: 2019-01-27 23:02:54
What if it's sent to a secure wallet?
