Yes, aslong you disconnect the internet before you generate the keys. Once generated, print keys and then power down the live OS.

If you think 4k each is a lot think again...

They've been around forever I have confidence they will be back. Whether that is to return the coins or relaunch. 
Assuming this was a very lucrative business so returning customer funds will help maintain loyal  customers if they choose to relaunch a new service.

I know the owner of a small bar who is paid 1k a month to plug the BTM in at his business. I asked how busy it was and he said 'extremely busy' and he was considering asking for more monthly rent.

Should have kept a few. Interest rate on a house is so low and we are about to hit a huge wave of institutional money.

Depends on how you interpret the question. Bitcoin cryptography has never been broken and the network has 99.99% uptime since its inception ( 
At this point I think is fair to say it's safe until proven otherwise. If that day does come, I believe the community would work together to fork the code and reverse the damage. This won't be good for a fiat investment but great for a technology investment. Meaning bitcoins bought today and stored properly will be safe until you're ready to use them.

I put my btc in deep cold storage many many moons ago. I don't plan on touching them in the next 10+ years and might even extend that until retirement or even pass them down to the next generation. I've mentally accepted that I may never spend these.
Doing this has not changed my attitude at all about btc. The community and technology is so exciting I can't stop myself from check r/bitcoin at least 5 times a day, along with other crypto related websites. I've been around this space a long time and it becomes more and more addicting as the years pass.
Keep up the good work all!
