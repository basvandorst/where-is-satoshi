Hi, thanks for the reply.
Ive been trading crypto for the last 4 years, seen about a 3000% ROI from the moves ive made. I have 0 invest history and invested in the tech over the price. I use Crypto as a currency where I can also. A friend is in your group and suggested, not sure its for me as I have a strategy that seems to work :/ I think :) just wanted to know if you was any good and not one of these people trying to make money of the hype, to see if my friend is getting ripped off. Didn't expect a direct reply from you.

Also might have a tool you could use, you can create custom dashboards and link them to your users, to compare coins. Works better on desktop

Hey, I'm not afraid to use my own wallet, I do all the time. I am travelling abroad in a few weeks and just wanted to load up a card I could use worldwide. 
I am yet to figure out (make time to look into) syncing my desktop wallet to my phone, so if you have any suggestions please let me know. I'm running Android and Arch Linux.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:22:45
Thanks, electrum has been set up across my laptop, PC and phone :) lets see how I get on.
@_date: 2017-07-04 14:50:42


I did have a look at these but they don't support mobile. I need to sync across all devices.
@_date: 2017-07-04 14:14:09
what good alternatives are there, that support BTC, LTC &amp; ETH, that can sync across my android phone, Fedora Desktop &amp; Arch laptop? 
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:36:21
I just want BCC?? Wallet I can import my keys and have my BCC. Im so confused about this all.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:21:54
Looks like a big sell off

We have had a couple of hundred people register so far, and a bit of interest. 
Still not decided on a beta lunch date yet but we are getting there.
