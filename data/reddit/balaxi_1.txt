we translated the white paper a year ago to HU, but forgot to add to Github:
Also we can help with HU translation of the site, as it appears, it needs a little update.

It will fit, if something tangible adds to it on the road as appreciation, we are more than happy, but not expected. I 'll contact you in a few days via Telegram, mine is

Why not advertising BTC in Latin-Amerika, Iran, African countries, Venezuela etc.?

I just read the Telegram chat...such a law-licking m\*\*\*rfu\*\*\*rs. They try to build something on top of the BTC ecosystem while forgetting the roots of the whole movement (decentralization, open source, collaboration, you hear?) Seriously these 'refugees' coming from the traditional banking, finance, startup scene just spoiling things up.

well...you don't have to do all at the same time...step by step...? country by country? region by region?

Okay. How about alien invasion?

All these hodlers, startups, MINERS, traders, exchanges - why on earth you guys do not support real world adoption? How about some charity for Venezuela? Or they actually do but we do not know about it?
Where is Bitfinex, Tether, Binance, Bitmain, Bitfury, Coinbase, OKEx, the whales, the Panteras, and Galaxy Digitals? - this is a chance to show it could work in real life too

Agree, Coindesk came out with some new metrics but that is a bit too sophisticated. Coin Market Cap offers a distorted way to look at the cryptomarkets. I read somewhere that some of the exchanges falsify trading volume just to rank better on CMC.

I think we realized later, that this is a BCH supported poject. The comics itself still first class educational material, so we migth wanna detach from the lost sheeps that will one day return for sure.
