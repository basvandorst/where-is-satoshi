I dont think he's the kind of guy who uses the same password in more than one place.
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:44:22
thanks !!
@_date: 2014-11-02 22:01:51
Am I too late for bits ?? Thanks !
@_date: 2014-01-12 18:38:49
can this be done ?
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:44:38
thank you !!! =)
@_date: 2014-01-12 18:59:00
not native english speaker here but i think that is sarcasm..
@_date: 2014-01-12 18:38:20
seriously, if they really support btc then every pool should guarantee a max amount of hashing power not allowing any more connections.. doesnt it makes sense ?
@_date: 2014-01-14 07:57:44
i wouldn't say it is a punish.. more like a rule or protocol
@_date: 2019-03-24 08:11:39
Draper was in Buenos Aires for a meeting (Draper Cygnus) 
La Bitcoineta is a small truck teaching cripto in the roads of Argentina. They used the opportunity to  interview Draper. 
He also had a meeting with the president and recommended him to switch from Argentinian Peso to Bitcoin

It just passed 20.000mxn
@_date: 2015-08-17 21:19:37
I know, I did a bit of research about TD and btc. I believe it is the price we pay for leaving fiat, eventually things will be better.
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:53:30
Any thoughts? Halp?
@_date: 2015-08-17 21:16:24
I guess yes, but Im not in the US. They said "For international orders we only accepts wire transfer as form of payment"
@_date: 2015-08-17 21:27:36
Im talking with support right now, they seem nice and helpful.
@_date: 2017-04-26 21:32:07
what's the reference ? ath in Bitstamp is 1350 (?)
@_date: 2015-03-16 20:25:40
@_date: 2013-05-04 21:06:11
can somebody re-post it or something ?
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:16:45
yeah.. get on TV first !!
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:14:17
Bitcoin faces social inertia..
@_date: 2013-12-27 06:24:31
uhh catcoin !?
@_date: 2013-05-04 21:07:06
is there an english version yet ?
@_date: 2013-04-24 18:07:04
wow.. i had that question since i discovered btc.. that gives me a whole new perspective about btc mining
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:45:22
oh.. i see. then excuse me for my post and thanks for the directions =) what is Fontas ?
EDIT: ok, he's a user..
@_date: 2013-05-12 20:23:42
you must be right, i guess people is watching the charts at gox but it doesn't necessarily mean that they would trade at the same price..
@_date: 2013-04-22 05:24:42
oh.. thanks =)
@_date: 2013-05-01 22:43:30
i ve just discover the trollbox.. he just did that again.. or he said he was doing it.. pumping.. 
like they say : he must be a rich 17 year old boy with 10 diff accounts just playing to wall street
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:56:58
that's what LOIC is about.. right ?
@_date: 2013-04-27 22:32:17
I believe btc should follow tpb and wikileaks in their way of the real internet freedom.. tpb announced some months ago that they are putting their servers in the clouds, literally they put servers in raspberry pi flying at 50-100 mts in quadcopters.
@_date: 2013-05-12 18:32:09
and why is that ?
@_date: 2013-04-25 06:02:20
uff.. dude, you have no idea how big is btc growing outside "the first world" bitcoin spain, bitcoin argentina, colombia, brazil.. make search for groups in fb.. endless
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:52:50
theymos you are indeed interesting enough for this.. 
- what is the biggest obstacle for btc ?
- what is the best thing than can happen to btc ?
thanks !
@_date: 2013-05-02 21:00:13
dying ? i would say living.
@_date: 2013-12-30 06:57:43
This is a similar idea 
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:38:37
maybe they question themselves : What's the worse thing can happen to our precious economy system ?
@_date: 2013-04-28 08:21:44
"If you shut down literally every exchange there would be no Bitcoin, because there would be no way to acquire it or spend it."
what about P2P, the main idea behind btc ? we dont need exchanges to make a transfer.. right ?
@_date: 2013-04-27 18:34:30
i get it. but btc is not illegal.. i mean, i didnt think so.. is it ? why are they shutting down places like bitfloor ?
@_date: 2013-04-28 06:24:21
thank you.
@_date: 2013-05-12 18:46:46
havent deposit yet.. i guess is about taxes ?
@_date: 2013-05-12 18:55:36
harder than mtgox !? wow.. i thought mtgox was hard because it was so far..
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:13:10
before the last rally, around 12us?
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:04:50
dont freak out, at this point you should know this is supposed to happen. hold on and wait for the bounce.
@_date: 2013-04-27 23:07:12
now they should start pushing for btc
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:38:58
ok.. i give up. thanks for your thoughts =)
@_date: 2013-04-28 06:50:43
exactly, the pp used to host wikileaks. dont know if still does.
@_date: 2013-05-08 14:44:19
is this barrier (the amount of time to download the blockchain) going to be insignificant at the ever-increasing internet speed ?
@_date: 2013-12-27 06:29:06
I believe in the good will and power of understanding of everyone.. I do believe in btc and I will keep talking about it the most I can.. but I know I am fighting windmills..
@_date: 2013-12-27 06:43:35
I understand.. maybe there must be kitties first in order to have knowledge later..
@_date: 2013-04-22 03:12:52
so the only way of guessing how far is the system going is to see how many addresses are in use ?
@_date: 2013-04-27 19:08:16
sure.. as usual with every gov not tolerating competition..
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:17:00
that is exactly what graffiti artists do, now they could have a way of "leaving the hat on the floor" and run away..
@_date: 2013-04-22 05:15:36
@_date: 2013-05-14 17:26:39
I can't find this information in english. Anyone knows where can I confirm this ?
@_date: 2013-12-27 06:35:43
I do realize that.. but I guess what, I didnt find bitcoin in a bitcoin forum.
@_date: 2013-03-22 18:19:56
that sounds promising. so it's like the protocol regulate itself to protect the majority ? i'm sorry, i'm just still trying to fully understand btc and it possible impact on society and corporations.
Thanks for the precise info =)
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:27:27
i think i can't completely understand how up/down vote works.. i thought only upvotes will get the post to a front page.
@_date: 2013-05-06 10:51:10
if coders and developers ruled the world we wouldn't have to be here looking for a crazy alternative currency market.
@_date: 2013-05-14 17:52:09
yes, i read that as a comment in alt1040.. but i thought computer power is computer power.. i mean, in the end what matters is to make calculations, no ?
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:09:18
what is that supposed to mean ?
@_date: 2013-04-28 04:26:36
I read that new in ALT1040, in spanish. this is what i found right now.
@_date: 2013-04-24 03:44:47
I am thinking the same thing.. I live in a small but very touristic town in the Riviera Maya.
How risky is it to tell shop owners to accepts btc and then buying from them ?
@_date: 2013-12-27 06:38:02
Of course not.. I was giving away btc :)
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:40:05
so is Evan Rose one of the guys who fired Berwick from the project ?
@_date: 2013-04-28 08:07:17
what about making a section with the only propose of pushing sites and companies to accept btc ?
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:01:32
i would like it more if it showed the date too
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:52:37
i can get you a place in paradise town next to the caribbean sea and you can pay me with btc
@_date: 2013-05-16 03:49:36
wow, i wish this was everywhere.. i wish we all were more like you.. i dont own any btc, but sending you tons of love and good vibes =) keep up the good work !
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:15:24
what's going on here ? I thought one can talk about btc in this sub.
why is my comment seen as trolling ?
@_date: 2013-03-24 00:01:23
that's what i mean, specially speaking about btc where everything would be anonymous.. they could falsify info about who's buying or something.. right ?
@_date: 2013-04-28 06:10:20
well.. 30 ppl found this interesting. If you would like to trade btc for cats then make a post about it =) 
@_date: 2013-12-27 06:36:35
I just thought I will have a little more feedback about it..
@_date: 2013-05-04 21:03:41
rencently in brazil they talked about some kind of currency agreement with china as well.. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:30:38
I think it was a good thing for bitcoin. the media had put their nose and showed an incredible propaganda for the last days all around the globe, maybe on propose or even pushed by the gov to generate traffic and new buyers making the price go up and eventually accelerating the crash.. but we are still here believing. Long live BTC !!
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:27:55
what about 30 years ?
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:27:30
at the current price, like 7 BTC / month, and for a place right on the beach maybe 12 BTC
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:29:07
no way.. it wont go under its last steady price
@_date: 2013-05-04 20:50:09
in spanish it sounds real funny too ;)
@_date: 2013-04-21 21:47:17
not even an estimation ?
@_date: 2013-04-28 06:32:29
that's what i thought.. but it seems like some people here are way too used to predigested information, so they get real angy and start kicking and screaming like 4 year old kids..
@_date: 2013-04-28 06:23:32
omg.. I did have an assumption. I assumed that most people here are at least average open minded and could figure out relationships between two different ideas. Anyway there are more friendly ways to show me where should I post it. Saludos "Super"
@_date: 2013-05-22 01:34:27
yeah right !? 
@_date: 2013-04-24 01:06:01
yes, but i mean the way it works, the idea.. it unifies the power of a group of machines for a single action.. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 18:05:53
but still, wouldn't a huge buy be enough to control/collapse or at least shake the market ? 
@_date: 2013-05-21 06:08:09
if the idea is to raise bitcoin awareness then I would start tipping outside r/bitcoin.. artists, bands, djs, performers.. ppl who actually never heard about it but are very good connected and have tons of followers.
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:39:20
I just loved the name !!
@_date: 2013-04-25 06:16:07
i mean.. in order to use btc, you only really need internet access and a bank account if you need to cash.. but both things are not hard to get. yes, even outside us.. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:53:47
hey there !! am I too late ?
@_date: 2013-05-02 21:03:22
I can provide you with almost anything in Tulum, Mexico, for btc (rooms, tours, food)
Good Luck !!
@_date: 2013-12-27 06:32:51
I spend time in many places.. what do you recommend ?
