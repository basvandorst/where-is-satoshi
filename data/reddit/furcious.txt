Ya lol at no point should cheaper and government be used in the same sentence. The government is highly inefficient, wastes money and runs things into the ground. No thank you. I'll spend my money how I please.

I can tell you have no argument because you end with "stay woke you poor ignorant hillbilly" I didn't even vote for Trump but people like you and comments like that are exactly why he won. You think you're so superior to everyone else don't you.

I almost never sell when I'm down, which was actually my problem with stocks, I kept holding
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:59:40
when you buy a car it tanks and you still have to pay back the loan
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:17:39
I already have a perfectly fine car that's free and clear
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:04:52
yeah I'd probably wait for a little dip at least 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:04:18
Within two years of graduation my pay will increase by $1000 a month, almost double the monthly loan payment

College is cheap first of all. You're not entitled to an expensive private education. There are community colleges and trade schools but I'm sure mane people think they're above being a plumber or electrician. Also there are so many scholarships out there that if you work hard you can have your education paid for. Mine is because I worked for it, people should try it sometime.

Thanks! That's the kind of answer I was looking for
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:03:05

You can have decent healthcare in the US too, it's called having a job with benefits. And no working at McDonald's doesn't warrant free healthcare

Black coffee is fine but how many people drink that 
@_date: 2017-09-10 18:13:47
Or just don't drink coffee and make the healthy and free choice of water. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:35:12
That's just the initial rollout

Is coinbase gonna survive when robinhood goes all in on crypto 
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:46:43
Buddy I know how to trade I just have a problem with not taking my gains. I've been up $4,000 on a penny stock and didn't sell because I wanted more 
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:13:28
25% reasonable? Do people outside the US have any idea how robbed they are?
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:50:49
I know how to trade I just don't sell because I get greedy. On several trades I was up thousands but got greedy and watched it crash and then hoped it would go back up. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:26:24
I don't sell so that statement makes no sense.
