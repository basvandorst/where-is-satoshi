There are three guys in my office who all bought into litecoin for that very reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:13:01
It's only been up two hours dude. Check the top posts and they are all twenty hours old. Also this is being talked about in the daily discussion thread that's stickied. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:30:15
If that's your argument go to litecoin. Bitcoin cash is a blatant rip off of a known name and coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:19:42
Huh, Really? It has one of the lower prices right now for coin though. I thought Gdax was the go to?

And there will be people saying oh bitcoin crashed from 17k to 17$

Gold can get stolen (hacked). Also a power outage doesn't make bitcoin useless. Paper wallets do exist. Not to mention gold has its own negatives. Heavy, Hard to transport. Harder to hide and secure. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:41:35
They suddenly started trading bitcoin cash with no warning after making it seem like it was far off in a road map released four days earlier. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 04:06:57
And yet the price is dropping. Wtf. News like this would have caused a run back in the day.
@_date: 2018-05-09 04:54:49
Front page of the subreddit you fucking tard. Do you go to sports center for current world news?!? 
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:39:03
I'm gonna start reporting your ass every day for spam
@_date: 2018-05-09 04:39:32
I would typically agree but a lot of good news shit has resulted in selling off since the 19k run. Market makes no sense lately. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:39:11
You do realize there are buy and sell orders you can see without lighting a flash and looking up your own ass?! 
@_date: 2018-05-01 11:04:42
My investments are fine. I love how asking about weird price movements gets me nothing but attacked on this sub lol. If the "discussion" around here isn't about hodor then it gets shit on. This sub is a dumpster fire.
@_date: 2018-05-01 00:46:07
..... Wtf major price drop around that time... If it keeps dropping we might have a physic

What the fuck was that sell off all about? Used to be bad news driving drops like last night.

^Ooooohhhhhh snappy verbiage. 
  Price has been stalling no matter the rose words you put on it. If the fucking NYSE was planning on making a ntc exchange shit would have been NUTS two years ago.

Upbit getting raided by Korean Authorities is what made the shit hit the fan over night.

Mtgox coins moving around has people selling I think.

The entire point is you don't need to exit the market. End game is use as currency. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 18:30:56
There are more reasons than profit to hold.... but sure keep going with your confirmation bias. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 13:53:16
Because they don't actually have that money to invest and are just looking to get rich quick. The only way to do this safely is pretend the money is already gone.
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:40:47
Quit plugging your shit every day and actually discuss it here asshole. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 18:25:28
Yep gets close and massive sell offs. 10k is gonna be a big wall to overcome imo. It's a nice round I'm out number for the weak hands. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:25:26
I will never not up vote this gif. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:56:02
Very strange we didn't have one when a major exchange was raided and with price movement like this... I don't want to get out my tinfoil hat...... 
@_date: 2018-05-09 04:37:50
Literally on the Frontpage 
@_date: 2018-05-01 10:22:59
Price moving *gradually* is a good thing. Up down, up down.. that's fine and doesn't bother me. Crypto suddenly dropping like 5% across the four major players isn't though. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 04:21:33
Physical paper wasn't the only way this information was available today. Also saying someone that's read physical news isn't into bitcoin seems elitist. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 13:34:43
Yep. Plus the US is waking up and we love wrecking the fucking price lately lol. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 18:15:13
Reported for spam. Quit plugging your shit channel over and over
@_date: 2018-05-01 10:41:44
Oops,That was supposed to be 5. It went from around 9400 to 8900 last night. Not to mention the other major cryptos took a hit too.

If you sent coins to a wrong adress that is kinda your fault though. I mean you don't blame the post office when you adress the letter wrong do you?
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:15:20
And their point was that if you look at it that way then you are just a insignificant spec on a insignificant spec floating through infinite space and there really is no point in getting out of bed in the morning. Is anything you do gonna matter in a thousand years? A million?

More than a bit imo. Having to manually type in a wallet address is a huge pita and a easy way to loose your money due to fat fingering one letter. I love the wallet other than that but for right now I can't use it as my main wallet due to that. Worried I'm gonna fuck up an address one of these days

I got groceries with bitcoin last night. Loaded up my bitpay card and went to the store.

Because no one is using Verge.... 
@_date: 2018-04-20 12:11:04
It's also a possibility it could go to zero. It's also a possibility it will go to 200,000. True no one knows. But the 6.4k barrier has been pretty solid. Unless some seriously bad news hits for bitcoin I doubt it will fall below that. Buy yep everyone's guess is just that. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:32:44
Well damn. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:03:50
Real talk I've eaten five cheeba chews and didn't feel a thing. There is a high chance 1000mg would be the same. My hypothesis is its due to my GERD but edibles don't do dick for me. You cannot fathom how much this saddens me :(
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:20:12
Kindly calm your tits and chill with the gatekeeping. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:27:14
That's not how the market works. Watch an exchange as recommended to get a better pictures. People put in buy or sell order at a price. If they move then that's the current price. If people started putting in sell orders at 8k but no ones buying them then the price goes down. If someone suddenly drops X bitcoin and it scares the people buying they are going to buy lower. Sellers see the price going down. They panic. Sell lower and the price moves lower.... Hope that made sense... 
@_date: 2018-04-18 14:20:54
That's not true at all and is bordering on being willfully obtuse. Every exchange could shut down for the day and I could still use it. It would just be limited. Additionally once bitcoin has the saturation that the dollar has it would have zero effect. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 11:04:55
Alright US....Can we keep it above 9k this morning?
@_date: 2018-04-20 11:06:56
Because their business practices have been shady as fuck trying to convince the world they are the "real" bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 11:02:33
Wells Fargo closed my account due to "suspicious" activity....I sold Bitcoin five maybe six times and that was the only unusual thing so ymmv
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:57:10
The 500 drop wasn't good either. Any jump one way or another is bad. Slow and steady growth leads to less rubber banding. The 20k btc end of last year was waaaay too much waaaay too fast. Now we're are seeing the correction and leveling. Nothing has happened negatively for btc lately. The mass media attention we received and subsequent block size/fee fiasco kicked segwit and lightening in the ass finally and btc is healthier than ever from a tech stand point. The major negative we face now is getting the mass public to understand it won't take 60$ to transfer money anymore. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:16:33
Because their is a finite amount of btc. The US treasury can print off as many 1$ bills as it wants. (inflation... Kinda)
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:13:57
The internet wasn't awesome for downloading things 20 years ago either. Had to grow.

I feel like 420 and control of emotions don't belong in the same sentence. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 12:47:05
Which is honestly a lot better than crazy spikes. I mean even at a stable 20$ increase a day that's a 7k increase a year. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 15:56:49
The only people seeing massive drops and losses are the people who bought in at the bubble a few months ago. That's on them for short sighted investment. None the less if they actually believe in the tech and aren't looking to get rich quick that investment will reverse in the long term. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:17:25
Thank you. One way is not easy to use and just puts a bad taste in people's mouth. "Oh you can take my money but can't give me money back?" exact words out of a friends mouth when I first showed him a local atm and the cash out was disabled. I educated him but still. Greenbacks still rule. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:35:45

Is it just me or is he making bitcoin sound like a pyramid scheme? The point isn't for X people to give up 25 bucks a week bro. Currency is what we are shooting for here... 
@_date: 2018-04-02 22:19:05
So much this. So many salty mother fuckers who bought at the top of the current hype before the correction... Even while all the old timers were warning shit would come back down before it went up again. Personally I'm glad the shit hit the fan because it finally saw movement on segwit and lightening. Bitcoin as a technology is healthier than it has ever been. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:15:35

It's 4/20 and they just finished a 1000mg edible. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:37:56
That isn't the first time or the only time I tried edibles. They don't effect a certain % of people but everyone I meet tells me exactly what you did. Oh you didn't get the right thing. I got dispensary shit every time lol. I always let them waste there money giving me something though. Maybe one day it will work. Until then the face they make when I smoke a few bowels an hour later is enough for me. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:25:05
Intrinsic value. And if you can't see the value in bitcoin why are you here? Don't spread fud. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 18:17:59
Mine were both from my own wallet. I personally think it's coinbase fuckery.
@_date: 2017-06-29 18:17:15
It had a priority fee..... 
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:50:24
Not true. After running the customer service gauntlet payment processing people found the transaction yet again but showed it not going through. They are currently manually creating an order for me. Hopefully to be resolved by end of day.
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:51:25
Although their payment processing being backed by coinbase explains things imo. God awful company.
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:55:54
It's both. The only thing stopping it from becoming a common everyday payment system is the current blocksize issue. Once it's hopefully resolved by the end of the year people will possibly start to see it as what it actually is. Money. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:52:44
Once we have bitcoin we don't need banks. I'm working very hard to be bank free and at this point I'm getting VERY close.
