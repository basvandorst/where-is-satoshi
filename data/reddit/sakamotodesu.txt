well convenience with security is trade-off, putting bitcoin on exchange is also convenience btw.
@_date: 2019-07-20 05:22:59
yeah, they can't ban bitcoin. They only can ban the exchanges, or retail usage prohibition. That's the worst case.

Regulation on bitcoin is no no.  
but Exchanges, Libra, or other Centralized wallet NEED to be regulated hard. They have people money, they need to be responsible

it's income tax, what i said is buying, not earning.  
(buying mean what you spent for that bitcoin is always equal to price of bitcoin at that time).

Credit card is your secret key (that you give to merchants/hacker for them to copy) so they can withdraw your money.
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:41:23
it's typo
@_date: 2019-08-23 11:16:06
With credit card information you can make a payment, but all merchants you touch have your credit card info saved in their database to pull money from you, so your copy of private key is copied to many database that very attractive to hackers (because contain a ton of customers money). This system need report checking, suspicious activity monitoring, super secure database, etc. Because the underlying architecture is broken.

@_date: 2019-08-27 08:15:49
Structure of bitcoin cash is still based on satoshi paper, but it's different than bitcoin, the most difference is in community, people who support it, developers who build it, and marketing.  I would argue their bad thing is in the community (less adopters, bad developer, low hashing power, etc) not the blocksize thing, increasing blocksize is not a bad thing, but based on current situation, most people not support increase blocksize, so branching to minor fork is bad. They advertise minor fork as bitcoin is scam, but BCH itself just bitcoin hardfork, minor chain, it's not bs.

you still need to trust them. But with your own wallet, you only need to trust yourself.

Just say you lost your bitcoin, as long as you not convert back to fiat they never know what you really own.
They only know you buy it, but thats it, doesn't proof you own it right now. Also for the tax it only applied if u buy fiat back so u get a gain. If u just hold the bitcoin, u not have any tax.
@_date: 2019-08-23 16:38:52
yeah, i also not comfortable with drug as second biggest commodity statement, i tought oil was bigger than that.  
But he probably just want to say 'drug trade is big, any money will be used for that trade including bitcoin'.
@_date: 2019-08-27 05:44:53
yes, the product is just bitcoin hardfork, although it's bad product (like weak hashing power, semi centralized mining, less developer, false claim, etc) but the underlying concept is still real (bitcoin but with bigger block).
@_date: 2019-08-23 08:52:48
People ask me "aren't you worried about the fact that you can buy drugs with this money?"  
As far as i concern i don't know any form of money that you can't buy drugs with, more specifically drugs are the second most traded commodity after food in the world and have been for last 150 thousand years.  
And if you couldn't buy drugs with your money i would argue  it's not actually money.  
so one of the criteria of money is you can purchase products and services, and if you couldn't purchase the second most traded commodity in the world with them, then is not really money.
@_date: 2019-08-23 09:01:40
money is not the solution/problem to drug trade, people who want trade will always find the way to do it. the solution is more like medical treatment, drug education, etc.

no, it because in internet, most of seller only accept bitcoin/other cryptocurrency.  
If offline (meet in person) i'm sure all of them use cash.
@_date: 2019-08-20 18:07:02
i don't know much, but isn't tax only applied if you sell the bitcoin and make gain?  
so if i just buy and hold, it should not have any tax obligation.

it's safer with bitcoin ;)

There is possible explaination that most of people seems not yet considered :  
 
'OP is not telling the truth'.  
I'm very sorry for u/juta14x if he really lost his fund, but there is a lot of people that benefit from incident like this, and it give reason/motivation to made up this incident.

Libra is replacing something like Paypal. supposedly better in lower fees. That's it.  
The only thing Libra did to bitcoin is making average people bit familiar with digital money and easier access to buy bitcoin.

yes, that's why the gold value is mostly come from scarcity.  
Precious things cease to be precious, but not less useful. Consider how useful gold is as a conductive metal,  
Imagine all the copper wiring in the world being replaced with more efficient element (because gold become cheap).
@_date: 2019-09-18 05:03:49
wait until we made digital jewelry from crypto.  
idk maybe in VR/AR or something
@_date: 2019-09-18 06:32:51
When something is useful doesn't mean it's precious.  
Also when something is precious doesn't mean it's useful.  
Precious &amp; useful is affecting each other, but in small amount, and both is not causation.  
there is a reason why gold is precious, that's the scarcity.  
yes gold is useful, but there are a lot of other more useful metal that very cheap.

Raspberry Pi Zero W - $10 (only $5 without wireless)  
Raspberry Pi Zero case - $2 (not necessary)  
16x2 LCD with i2c module - $1  
8GB microSD - $?? (sorry i forgot include this because i have a lot of unused microSD)
  
If you already have raspberry pi, you only need to buy additional $1 16x2 LCD screen with i2c module (also buy cable &amp; pin header, but it's very cheap).  
   
Gudie :  
0. [Setup &amp; access]( raspberry pi (obviously).  
1. Follow this [LCD wiring &amp; setup tutorial]( See [layout pin of Raspberry Pi Zero]( if you don't know.   
2. Use [this python script]( and run it [as service]( (or you can just run it normally like 'python btc.py' but you need too run it every restart if not as service).  
  
It will display latest data from coinpaprika API &amp; coingecko API every 10 seconds.  
  
While displaying, Raspberry Pi also can be used as many other thing, including tools like PiHole to enable network-wide ad blocking as seen on [LinusTechTips video](

it's about 5 Watt electricity, and internet bills, but it's nothing, data transfer for btc monitor only few kb per minutes.

digital currency is not digital money (money and currency is different, they both serve different function)
@_date: 2019-09-08 08:49:17
my local electronic store, it just local brand, if i convert my local currency into dollar it exact cost is  
$1.07 for 16x2 LCD with I2C module  
$2.34 for raspi case + heatsink + pin header  
$14.22 rasberry pi zero w (yes my local store price for rasbery pi more expensive)  
  
i seach online and get this [bunch of exact LCD with cost range $1](  
for the case price maybe because the quality, my case is plastic, not transparent.
@_date: 2019-09-07 14:21:44
i'm too lazy to unlock my phone just for checking price.

@_date: 2019-09-07 21:50:47
yeah, RPi is overkill just for 16x2 LCD display, but i do it because i already have &amp; use raspberry pi for my network DNS and some file networking.
@_date: 2019-09-05 10:12:17
because you already generate single seed, and Trezor won't ever display your seed again.  
If you want make a split u need to generate new seed.  
What he mean by weakest point is, your old seed is already single, so you only need that single seed to restore, no matter if you split it up, in the end you only need just 1 (that first seed / old seed).
@_date: 2019-09-17 17:29:49
Bitcoin doesn't need to be backed by anything, because it have the value itself.  
Like gold, it's **not backed** by anything, Gold have value itself from the cost spent on mining the material from earth (the rarity).  
Meanwhile, US Dollar can be printed as much as you like. Just take loan and you will create dollar from thin air.  
'Why bitcoin have value' is exact same question as 'why gold have value'.  
Gold and Bitcoin is very different, but the origin of the value is exactly the same.

i buy components from electronic store near my location.  
but i'm sure you can buy it online too.

there is no modern world without plastic, it used everywhere, almost any modern product has plastic as component, the property plastic is so awesome.  
there is a reason why gold is valueable, but most of it's value not come from there.  
For the 'bitcoin maximalist' i also agree on your comment, but i don't understand why you make that comment here.
@_date: 2019-09-07 14:19:03
the problem is need internet access, so need add way to input WiFi info (SSID &amp; password), or you must add ethernet cable plug to the device.  
all other component can be very simple, but connecting to internet add complexity to the user, in my raspberry pi, it connected to my router by inputting network info on sdcard with my computer. For average consumer that's not great.
@_date: 2019-09-18 05:38:16
i'd say bitcoin flourished more because of humanity entering digital age than cross border regulation.  
the more we live in digital world, the more need for digital money (different than digital currency).  
For now the only digital money is cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2019-09-08 11:07:52
you can just randomly pick word from [BIP39 wordlist]( Then use offline program/algorithm [like this one]( to see generated public address.  
that seed also can be used in many software wallet or just keep offline as cold wallet.
@_date: 2019-09-08 12:01:10
yep, our bitcoin is on the bitcoin network, we only keep the access key
@_date: 2019-09-18 04:43:02
you make jewelry from gold because gold have value, **not** gold have value because u can make jewelry from it.  
for physical question, Money actually is a language, gold is the medium/technology to transmit it. So if you think that way, actually non-physical money is not a problem.  
Bitcoin supply is far more certain, the code programmed that way, 21 million is the exact number from the algorithm/protocol. Participant need to agree if want create change to the program, so as long most of people agree 21 million is the maximum, then it certainly stay that way.  
Unlike gold, you can find a shit ton of gold in asteroid
@_date: 2019-09-22 15:17:02
also, most of BTC richest address from exchanges, so it's not really owned by 1 entity
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:00:47
you can [extract private key]( from BRD seed even when they gone.  
then that private key can be used to access your wallet
