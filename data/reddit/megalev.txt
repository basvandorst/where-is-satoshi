Love the fact this immature nonsense got gold. Only one I passed on to me mates

Just to chime on +1

Yeah it is. Doesn't pass any nazi tests. Have to think about it twice in the UK, probably have to think about it in the US once.

Good man.

Yeah but that's only half a story as it stands. Whilst his favourite holding period is forever, I'm sure 'rebalancing' or selling isn't exempt from his vocabulary.

Yeah. Just move on. Forget about it

Interesting one, whilst I don't want a debate about being a bitcoin maximalist - I probably am one - everything I've bought with crypto has been with litecoin. Same with settling up with mates.
Somehow though I'd have no problems disagreeing with someone posting that ultimately ltc is trending to zero

Nah this is too much. Do people just randomly attack middle class people? Fear of the wrench attack is strong but the actual risk isn't that great. E. G. You have a one in a million chance of dieing today (you do), once you start doing stuff this goes up, e.g. horseriding this goes up 100x (or more I dunno the figures). Targeted wrench attack is way less risk than generally living life, but it is hard for humans to perceive it this way for now.

It's the only other believable blockchain for me. Its almost free and super quick
@_date: 2019-06-05 23:03:14
Yeah you can't sleep easy at night with it on coinbase

This deserves its own thread; I honestly have no idea

At this point no one is gonna care if bcash is 51%'d. Not even us. Peeps will still keep gambling on it. Public engagement with that happening is zero. It was a dividend.

Yeah even though its zero hedge it shows the  desperateness to 'mine' more money.

Great question. Lightning seems watertight and an elegant solution, however with only one, I have no reference.
