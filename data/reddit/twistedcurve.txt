The answer to this wall of text is quite simple: 
It has been devastating to see how many businesses stopped accepting bitcoin as a result of crazy fees that were approaching 10 USD per transaction.
Segwit2x buys us enough time so that this never happens again until second layer solutions are ready.

That is correct. Unfortunately electricity costs make it not economical to run a miner in most countries. So you would need a lot of users that mine at a loss.

1 week of mining currently costs ~50 million USD. Nobody would spend this money to make a change that would drive all the users away and make the new chain worthless.

The weighted data on coin.dance shows that only 1% disagree with segwit2x.

If it is a combined majority of economy and hashpower then it is not an attack. It is a form of democracy.

To be precise, the time integral of the hashpower defines bitcoin for me.

Either you need a mining node with significant hashpower or an economic node that handles a lot of transactions (eg by opening an exchange).

That was only because of the sudden difficulty reductions in bitcoin cash. Somehow the market was not prepared for this. Miners could mine much more than 6 blocks per hour while maintaining a comparably high market price.

1) Miners are a incoherent group of many individuals. It doesn't make sense to assign an ideology to all of them.
2) Bitcoin consensus rules are defined by the chain with the most proof-of-work in the long run. This defines what a valid block is (and not some magic fluffy consensus obtained from the feeling of people).

Well, I do understand that it makes sense for 2x to not have replay protection. It will increase the chance of 2x surviving because it forces users to make a decision.
Because of the slow difficulty adjustment there is a good chance that only 1 chain survives. Seeing this as an attack? Or as a majority decision of economy + hashrate?

@_date: 2017-09-20 23:11:49
Such a change that survives 1 week needs an incentive for both the users and for the miners.
It is indeed getting interesting if you think about a miner proposing to redistribute bitcoin from the richest 1% to the poorest 70% of bitcoin users. However, this will probably not happen because of the same reasons it does not happen with Fiat.
@_date: 2017-09-26 07:13:24

Miners have long term interests and short term interests. So they don't necessarily follow the market if it is against their long term interest.
In addition the market is influenced by miners via block delays (as we have seen during the BTC-BCH difficulty oscillations).
To answer your question: No, it is not as simple as miners blindly following the market price.
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:53:52
A slightly smaller number of people running a full node does not mean "complete centralization".
Having 100 nodes in 100 different countries would be enough to keep bitcoin alive. It is difficult to shut down p2p networks by attacking nodes. 
And in case of an attack on bitcoin the community would spin up new nodes faster than any government can react.
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:52:30


I cannot follow you. So you don't want bitcoin to change at all? Or you want changes imposed by a minority?

I support Segwit2x because I am afraid of more and more businesses stopping to accept bitcoin because of too high fees.
Currently (and especially after the shutdown of BTC-e) all the bitcoin exchanges are government controlled. We need businesses that accept bitcoin.
Exchanges can be easily shutdown as we have seen in China.
I don't see a hostile takeover of the bitcoin network itself as an actual risk. Also not with slightly larger blocks.

The remote control options of antminers was a feature for clients who run their miners in data centers.
Besides this potentially being a security risk, "antbleed" was mostly a smear campaign against bitmain.
@_date: 2017-09-26 23:30:55


Exactly. And for this we need on chain scaling before we get 2nd layer solutions.
And p2p trading is nearly nonexistent. See bitsquare etc.
I have seen way to many businesses stopping to accept btc in the last year.

care to elaborate?

Your fallacy is to believe that miners would mine on a chain with arbitrary rules and no users. It would be a waste of resources. Such a chain would not have the most proof-of-work in the long run.

Boeing are NYA companies, China are the miners on the NYA. Airbus are "Small blockers" shouting that NYA is violated because China bought a small Learjet from Bombardier (BCH). Obviously Boeing and China don't care about Airbus shouting (because it is clear that Airbus just wants to get the deal with China; miners on the "small block" chain).

You need to trust them. And hope that any potential tempering is found by another user before your coins are stolen.

No risk of losing your wallet or getting robbed? With bitcoin? Well... it is all good if you know what you are doing.

It is open source. No need to trust the authors.
@_date: 2017-09-26 13:16:48
No, this is wrong. The effective block size is increased by Segwit.
@_date: 2017-09-26 09:00:42
That supports my claim. The profitability of BCH vs BTC is pretty much at parity.
The fluctuations in the beginning are a result of diffulty oscillations and the market not being prepared for this.
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:36:16
It is very unclear what will happen. If most hashpower is on the 2x chain, it will be impossible to transact btc on the segwit chain.
The question is who chickens out first. Majority of users moving to the 2x chain or miners sending hashpower back to the segwit chain.
@_date: 2017-09-20 08:24:58
There are currently 3% Segwit transactions at most. How should this be reflected in any trend?
Here is the fee development in the last year:

Not sure what you want to accomplish by insulting other bitcoin enthusiasts.
The thing that dropped is bitcoin dominance. From over 80% down to less than 50%.

This is not true. 8 MB is only possible if blocks have unrealistic amounts of witness data.

Bitcoin has proof-of-work as consensus mechanism. It is confusing that this side of the debate argues so profoundly against using this consensus mechanism for protocol changes.
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:44:11
It is the blocksize increase with the most support in the community.
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:06:05
That it an interesting thought. I guess the same result would be achieved by not allowing to withdraw bitcoin from chinese exchanges but allowing to transfer bitcoin between chinese exchanges.
However, China currently allows every person to take 50k USD capital out of the country per year. This would hopefully be reflected in a new framework for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-10 07:26:40
That depends on the accumulated proof-of-work it will get.
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:40:41
51% of some magic quantity can change bitcoin. This is how the protocol works.
Most trouble with bitcoin originates from the difficulty to define what this magic 51% quantity is. And it is certainly not users.

Well... in this forum the negative side is largely suppressed. So better read both and then make up your opinion.

Either way, the lack of replay protection increases the chance of the minority chain to die. 
Which I see as a good thing, independent of the outcome of the hardfork. (just my opinion)

The real bitcoin is the one with the most accumulated PoW.
@_date: 2017-09-26 21:29:42


No. It just requires one other person that knows the same TA you are using and trading against it.
@_date: 2017-09-20 22:52:01
Well, I would weaken that a bit: I would follow the chain that has the most accumulated PoW on a ~1 week average.
I would not necessarily follow every short term fluctuation.
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:47:04






This mixture of FUD and conspiracy theories is so annoying. Here is your evidence of full blocks:
@_date: 2017-09-10 11:34:06


No, there is no cart or horse here. Consensus is defined by both hashpower and economy. 
A chain without hashpower is not usable because there won't be any blocks.
A chain with &lt;20% hashpower can be easily attacked by miners and is not secure.
This influences economic decisions of users.
@_date: 2017-09-20 07:18:19
You are looking at short term fluctuations. Try to see the long-term trend.
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:20:05
Well, it just needs one patient miner to keep your old bitcoin alive. 
Whether it will be a store of value if the majority of people moves on is another question.
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:32:36


You are free to do that. I personally do not have that strong opinions about the future.

How can you hand over bitcoin to someone? It is open source and users can decide for themselves what software they run.

That is not true. The hashrate correlates very well with the price per coin.

Good that the Bitcoin-house is not owned by anyone. And calling everyone else a burglar is certainly not useful.

The Chinese government wants to avoid uncontrolled capital streams out of the country. Nothing less and nothing more.
I am curious with what solution they could come up with. They could limit the amount of Bitcoin a person can buy per year. Or implement very strict reporting of finances for everyone owning bitcoin.

No, centralization of development has only small impact on bitcoin. Everyone can run the code he/she wants.
Much more relevant is mining centralization, which will only be slightly impacted by a change in blocksize.

Both subs are much older than bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-09-27 09:18:45


I would also count them as centralized exchange (even though they facilitate p2p exchanges). They can easily be shut down.


The problem is that high fees are ruling out a lot of use cases independent of p2p or p2b.
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:26:18
Read my post: "Bitcoin consensus rules are defined by the chain with the most proof-of-work in the long run."
In the long run a chain without users will not be mined. Bitcoin is defined by the chain with the most proof-of-work. **Not** by some arbitrary felt consensus.
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:57:53
I guess most miners are significantly invested in BTC, just like everyone else working with Bitcoin. But a significant part of the mined coins goes into running costs of the mining operation.

There are two bitcoin religions:
1) The religion of bitcoin as a currency with low fees and slightly smaller decentralization.
2) The religion of bitcoin as a store of value and slightly larger decentralization.
Roger Ver supports 1) while this forum tends to support 2) a bit more.
