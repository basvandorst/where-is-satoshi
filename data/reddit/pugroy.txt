Yup but once you log into GDAX it tells you how they don’t support the state of MN as well as 2 other US states and that they can’t let you finish setting up your account on GDAX, it’s garbage and they don’t seem to be adding the last 3 states anytime soon, happily made my move to Gemini

You’re right it may not be, and it is odd that Coinbase works.
 Also other exchanges such as Gemini work, so if Gemini can work with the state legislature and their laws I don’t see why GDAX can’t

Not even just that, they only have 5 US states that are able to buy crypto on the app

Thank you so much for sharing this! This is amazing! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:15:43
I signed up 4 days ago now and I’m still waiting...

Do you personally think it’s worth it if I have BTC on Coinbase to move them immediately to a paper wallet to get the free coins from the fork? 
For context I am waiting until I have enough built up in Coinbase that the transaction fees to move them to a safer place will be negligible, I understand the risks of keeping BTC on Coinbase but that’s my current plan.
If I moved them now the fees would take a good chunk of what I have, but is it worth it to get the free coins from the fork? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:33:55
Yes I agree, I am glad I haven’t truly had any bad experiences, I hope your situation improves
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:05:42
As someone with no background in coding or programming, what basic concepts should I learn in order to better understand the coding that goes into bitcoin? 
Any sources you’d recommend? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:04:46
Really....? Oh boy that’s unsettling 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:08:42
Well that’s good to hear! I can’t wait to start using them over Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:49:16
Just the fee for buying BTC in Coinbase,  I should be buying with my bank account to minimize fees right? But also should I be putting less in at a time? I’m your comment you were saying it’s better to buy less more frequently than like $100 worth all at once, but then my question is, how is that better if you get hit with more fees? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:11:49
Wow thank you so much! So you recommend bitstamp? Does bitstamp hold my money like Coinbase does so I can accumulate it until I have enough to move to a hardware wallet? Also what would you recommend I do with the BTC in Coinbase then? Unfortunately GDAX isn’t supporting my state right now so I feel pretty trapped in Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:04:04
I didn’t say that? I said they verified me quickly, if you read my posts and comments I say how I want to switch and that Coinbase is garbage...
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:43:47
Haha I wish, I have the luck of living in 1 of the 3 US states that GDAX doesn’t support, I’m stuck in Coinbase...
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:31:49
Yes I understand that, my point is I got verified on Coinbase immediately despite others not being able too, and on the flip side I cannot get verified on Gemini, but I’ve seen people comment saying how they signed up around the same time and it only took a day or so. I understand that there’s a ton of new customers, I’m mostly just pointing out the inconsistency and my own experience 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:08:35
Okay that’s what I kinda figured, also with GDAX not supporting my state currently I think I’m best leaving it in the exchange till I have more built up, thank you! 
And would you say it’s always worth it to use your bank account rather than a credit/debit card for lower fees? 
EDIT: Downvoted? I’m sorry for asking a question...
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:20:25
Yeah still waiting, hopefully soon 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:19:01
This is very helpful thank you but I have a follow up question, I just started as well and I put $100 in because I didn’t want fees to hit me as hard, wouldn’t I get less value from all the fees if I put in $10-$20 a week instead? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:44:16
Woah 5 months? Which site? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:55:19
I know this will get downvotes cause everyone hates Coinbase currently, and I’m not saying I like them, but I did get verified from their app near instantly,
Gemini however has taken almost a week now, sent a couple emails and still no response.. and I really want to switch over 
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:38:59
Like a day before I registered to Gemini I think, either way it would still all likely be within the influx of newbies 
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:19:25
I’ve seen people on Reddit comment that they signed up at the same time and been verified within a day or 2
Not defending Coinbase though, I know they’re garbage and I want to switch, just saying my experience 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:32:11
I feel you, MN here so I can’t use GDAX also I’ve been waiting on Gemini verification for nearly a week with no customer support responses, and I’d really like to switch over to Gemini ASAP 
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:13:03
Wow that has to be the best compilation of resources I’ve seen! How is that not in the sidebar?? 
Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:55:56
And if GDAX doesn’t support our US state? Just screwed and trapped in Coinbase huh? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:30:18
Worth it
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:31:02
Unless you’re outside the 5 US states they service
