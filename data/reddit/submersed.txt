They provide an affiliate or referral program, which advertises high reward commissions to affiliates, and then after all of the affiliates have put thousands of dollars into promoting their service, they make a sudden change to the affiliate program to drastically reduce (-67%) the commission with no advanced notice.
They've done this multiple times. It's sleazy and wrong. It's taking advantage of the community. 
There are other reasons in addition to this as to why they've lost my trust, but this is the reason I relate closest to (I've lost thousands of dollars in invested time and advertising dollars due to this program).

I am personally invested in Bitcoin as a speculative instrument (that I believe in very strongly), with the purpose of achieving financial freedom. If I had won $1,000,000 and maintained my current lifestyle, my goal of financial freedom would've been accomplished and I would no longer need to hedge on speculation. 
However, I would have no problem continuing to use Bitcoin recreationally for the things I use it for today, and I would then like to see the technology grow for the convenience factor, not the getting rich factor.

Um. Because Bitcoin is extremely volatile in the short term. Just because it's appreciating now, doesn't mean it will continue to appreciate for eternity.
Edit: you also don't understand tax law. When you spend the appreciated asset (Bitcoin) it is considered the same as selling it. You record your gains to-date on the coins you spent, and pay capital gains on that amount.

You must be new here. “Has huge potential to revolutionize the industry” IS the reason why. It always has been, always will be, until the deed is done. You don’t need much more.
 Bitcoin will grow itself, and it’s not one person making a price prediction that will “get them rich”...the reason I say you must be new here is because this happens all the time, and actual price does not respond to price predictions like this, ever.

I think you're under-estimating the amount of currently existing wealthy people. There's a LOT of them. 
Bitcoins early adopters will not be a significant enough number of people to cause any meaningful change in social structure as you put it. Also, you're forgetting about people who are smart about this and re-diversify frequently. For example, there will be some people who hodl indefinitely, and they may come out ahead of everyone else as things settle/stabilize over the next decade, but there will be others who sell portions on the way up and convert into other asset classes, rebalancing their portfolios to fit their desired level of risk. Others won't be able to resist the lambo-temptation. Can't forget about them.
@_date: 2015-08-30 17:00:52
I used Gyft frequently when they ran consistent cash back deals that were better for Bitcoin than any other payment method. It seems like they still do this occasionally, but I remember them being a bit more enticing. 
Also, I used Gyft when my Bitcoin holdings were much more substantial than they are now. Less money = less spending.

You missed the one where they offer a $75 bonus, and advertisers bring in hoards of new users, many of which won't complete the offer in time, thus not triggering the $75 payout. Free users for Coinbase who might one day complete the offer and only provide the advertiser $10 of the promised $75. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 12:40:04
I actually received an e-mail, but I believe it was only for top affiliates (not sure what that qualifier is). I also did not promote this offer very hard due to the frequent changes to the program. Unfortunately, until they take measures to ensure the program is fair to advertisers, they will continue to see lackluster results from the program while gaining a poor reputation among the community. I submitted my comments on how they might be able to improve the program via e-mail. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 04:43:46

@_date: 2015-10-02 16:18:36
Uh, actually...it does. 
@_date: 2015-10-02 16:21:20
I actually agree. It was very evident that they intended for this bonus to be around for a while. No forewarning of it going away is a poor way to treat affiliates. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 12:18:54
It was nice of Coinbase to offer the $75 commission to begin with, but the real problem here is that advertisers are spending large amounts of money promoting Coinbase under the assumption they'll receive a certain ROI. However, users can take months to complete a qualifying buy ($100 worth of BTC).  I've been promoting Coinbase for a long time - I have users I've referred years ago who are just now completing a task, so these things can take time. 
If each referred user had a specific bonus associated with their account, that bonus would not change as the Coinbase referral program changed. This seems like a fair solution to the problem. If the current bonus is $75, advertisers can promote the service assuming any user they refer will always provide a $75 payout, likewise with a $10 payout. 
Coinbase is willing to pay $10 for a user sign up - obviously an advertiser will spend up to a certain amount in order to receive that $10 pay out. Suddenly, Coinbase changes it to $75 and now advertisers can spend a lot more.
I've submitted my comments to Coinbase for how they might be able to improve the program in the future.

To anyone who says: "mining is unprofitable", I was also told 2 years ago that mining was unprofitable. That was when I could've mined multiple bitcoins per day.
As the value of bitcoins continuously rise, what is worth 18 cents today, could be $1,800 tomorrow (hypothetical). So never let anyone tell you 'mining isn't worth the electricity cost', because if I didn't listen to that, I'd be pretty damn rich today.

I tried using my Bitcoin purchased Target giftcard yesterday, and it did not work. I e-mailed Gyft support letting them know of the issue and they responded saying that my experience was common. They stated that the target giftcards have a known issue that they are working on where certain numbers are inverted. 
My first gyft experience was rather embarrassing. I was excited to show my friend, and the employee, confused, asked what I was showing her on my phone. I said "it is a giftcard, can you scan it"...she did, and nothing. 
After a bit of back and forth questioning, she was ready to call a manager and my friend, embarrassed as the line formed behind us, swiped his credit card and we left.
Unfortunate first experience, but I am sure they are working to resolve the issue I had.
