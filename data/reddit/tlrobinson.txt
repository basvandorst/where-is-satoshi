Basically the transaction hash wasn't intended to be used as an identifier before the transaction was included in the blockchain. In fact, until BIP 30 and 34 it was even possible for transactions with identical hashes to end up in the block chain.
If Mt Gox lost money, it's not (only) due to malleability but also because they weren't properly tracking/invalidating "lost" transactions before resending a new transaction.
Whether malleability is also considered a bug is a separate matter, but it's not a critical bug on it's own.
I wrote a simple explanation of the two issues here: 
Here's a proposal for fixing it: 
Basically, yes, they'll increment the version number and allow senders to remove sources of malleability. Note that certain transaction types require malleability, but standard ones do not.

One interesting proposal I've heard to make zero-conf transactions safer is a system whereby recipients can get a weak assurance from large miners that they will include a specific transaction in their next block.
e.x. each miner/pool has a public key they include in the blocks they mine, maybe their payout address, or some info in the coinbase. The public keys that mined a certain percentage of the last N blocks (say, 1% of the last 1000 blocks) are allowed to broadcast transaction hashes signed with their private key, assuring the recipient that they will include the transaction in their next block.
This gives the recipient some quantified level of confidence that their transaction will be included in the next block, since they can estimate the probability each miner who has given them a signed assurance will mine the next block. 
Alternatively, to reduce load on the P2P network, perhaps it could be done out of band by having recipients connect directly to miners, but using the P2P network allows everyone to see if miners are ever break their promises.
Have ideas like this been written up anywhere?

You should know Bitcoin payments are:

2. Irreversible

All other ways except:
* usefulness: number of merchants and users
* liquidity: number of traders and users
* security: number of miners (though arguably Litecoin's scrypt partially counterbalances Bitcoin's volume of miners)

I don't know much about gambling, but doesn't the "dealer" follow some predetermined and known rules, so even if they *know* the shuffle ahead of time they can't cheat? Thus the only way to cheat is by "stacking the deck".
If that's not the case, then yeah, their "provably fair shuffling" is completely useless in proving the game itself is fair.
From my limited knowledge of cryptography their shuffling scheme seems legit, but I haven't actually verified it.
EDIT: looking a little closer, their scheme is a little odd. I'm not sure why they're using a Mersenne Twister instead of a CSPRNG (though I'm also not sure if it matters). Also they say they ["add a little extra security"]( by adding the server and client seeds, but if the client knows the server seed it could just subtract it before returning the client seed to the server.
A simpler scheme would be to have the server generate a 256 bit random number, hash it, send the hash to the client, have the client generate a 256 bit random number, send it to the server, the server XORs the two and uses that to shuffle.
By giving the client only 32 bits to reshuffle seems possible that the server could pregenerate some seeds that are biased in their favor.

The point is you should spend BTC whenever you can and replenish it with [fiat currency of choice] in order to support the merchants that have invested in supporting Bitcoin.

Your scheme seems a little complex to me. Is there a reason you couldn't just do the following:
1. Server generates a random 256 bit number.
2. Server SHA256 hashes that number and sends the hash to the client.
3. Client generates a random 256 bit number and sends it to the server.
4. Server XORs the two numbers and somehow uses the result to "shuffle" the deck once (or alternatively, shuffles once with the server seed, and again with the client seed)
After the game is over the server sends the client it's seed so the client can hash it and verify it was in fact generated before the client send it's own 256 bit number.
Also, why are you using a Mersenne Twister rather than a cryptographically secure PRNG?
Since the MT only generates 32 bit numbers it seems there are only 2^32 possible shuffles for each server-generated seed. In theory you could pre-generate a bunch of numbers and select the ones that are biased in your favor.

Why would it be unwise? You can generate a new address for every transaction.
@_date: 2013-05-19 02:07:57
Normally your client/computer contains your private key, thus is vulnerable to malware on that computer stealing it (even if it's password protected, the malware could include a keylogger)
Instead, only this device would contain the private key, which can't be read directly from device, rather the host computer/client send it requests over USB (or Bluetooth, or whatever) to sign specific transactions ("Send X BTC to Y address?"), and you have to look at the request on the device's screen and physically push a button to confirm it.
There is still one vulnerability though: the malware could swap out a legitimate address with their own address, and you'd have no way of knowing unless you confirmed the address through some other means than the compromised computer.
The Bitcoin developers want to solve this by layering on a payment protocol using recognizable names (like domain names or email addresses) that are signed using essentially SSL certificates. That way instead of "Send X BTC to 1QAfdF2fwgasfd43fAsfq..." you'll see "Send X BTC to eff.org" or "bob or whatever, and you can be reasonably sure the transaction the device is signing will be sent to the correct address.

That was exactly my point about "non-currency distributed payment system like Ripple".

I like this.
How would that work though, both the purchase price (from the buyer) and "insurance" (from buyer and seller) must only be able to be "released" in the same transaction, right? And if one or the other doesn't send their insurance then the other's insurance should be returned.
Is Script powerful enough to do all that?
Also, what happens in a dispute, say the package is lost in the mail? The buyer doesn't want to release the funds because he'd lose his money, and the seller doesn't want to ship another item because he'd lose money.

A better analogy would be a system where you can send funds directly from any trusted bank instantly, without an intermediate processor like Visa/MasterCard. The point is there's no single intermediary that has a monopoly on processing the payment.
Banks (potentially thousands of them) would publish their "green addresses" which merchants could trust with zero confirmations. As long as you keep your funds in any trusted "bank" you could make instant purchases.
Depending on merchants' risk tolerance they may also accept payment below a certain amount from any address with 0 confirmations. If you're buying a computer maybe you'll have to wait 20 minutes, or if you're buying a car maybe you'll have to wait an hour.

That's not an inherent property of crypto-*currencies*, a distributed/cryptographic payment system (i.e. that's not also it's own currency) that can be used to send/trade fiat currencies and commodities could potentially do that equally well.

It would be nice if they had an n-of-m scheme, so maybe Gavin and Satoshi could have master keys, but a secondary group of developers could have 3-of-5 or something, so if 3 developers agree on an alert they could transmit.

How did you come to that conclusion? By my calculations it would only take about $800,000 worth of BFL ASICs to equal the current total hash rate.
(40TH/s global hashrate) / (1.5TH/s per Mini Rig) = 27 Mini Rigs
(27 Mini Rigs) * ($30,000 per Mini Rig) = $800,000
Of course BFL isn't shipping, but even if you had to fab your own ASICs it probably wouldn't cost more than a few million dollars. Well within reach of governments or large companies.
That cost will rapidly increase as ASIC rigs start shipping, but its still far from hundreds of millions of dollars.

I have no problem with people "hoarding" some or most of their Bitcoin, but it is also in their interest to **use** Bitcoin as much as possible to support and encourage the merchants who support Bitcoin.
That doesn't mean you have to spend the Bitcoins you bought as an investment, you can keep a small balance for purchases, and replenish it with your fiat currency of choice as you spend it.

If you preordered from BFL with Bitcoin before BTC skyrocketed over the past month or two wouldn't it make sense to cancel your order to get those more valuable Bitcoins back?
This also raises an interesting question about preorders taken in BTC. Are they required to refund in BTC, or if they advertised in USD (or whatever) could they refund the current BTC equivalent. If its the former, should the company leave the funds in BTC, or convert to a less volatile currency?

That's exactly what Bitcoin payment processing services like BitPay and Coinbase already do. Merchants don't need to worry about the details of how these services work, they just get paid in dollars (or whatever), while users can pay in Bitcoin. They pay a small fee for the convenience and reduced risk (which is still typically less than credit card processing fees)

Bitcoin alone won't do it. In fact it could easily do the opposite: give the government unprecedented insight and control over every citizen's financial transactions.
How? One simple law could be passed: every business and citizen must report the identity of every address they transact with. If the government sees a transaction from a known address to an unknown address they'll know exactly who to track down to interrogate/punish.
They could also outlaw accepting certain blacklisted bitcoins (e.x. all "untracked" coins), using mixing services, etc.
If you want to operate entirely in the black market, then yeah, Bitcoin is great, but as soon as you want to interface with businesses/people who comply with government you're screwed.
Really it's the ideal currency for a totalitarian government.
(A conspiracy theorist might suggest the government *wants* Bitcoin to succeed so they can put this tracking system in place, and so something truly anonymous (Chaumian cash, ZeroCoin, etc) doesn't gain traction)

As I understand it, one thing is certain: eventually all miners will be running the most efficient hardware (with a tradeoff between upfront cost and power efficiency), in the cheapest data centers (tradeoff between network latency and bandwidth/electricity/cooling/space costs).
Whether that's a small number large miners, or a lot of individual miners is a question is how much the economies of scale matter, and whether cost is the only thing the matters.
If you can fab more efficient ASICs than everyone else, then scale matters a lot. If the most efficient ASICs are available on on the free market, not so much. But if bulk buyers of ASICs can get discounts on the hardware, then maybe it is. Same with network connectivity, electricity, cooling, space, etc. Larger customers get better rates than smaller customers.
But perhaps a lot of individuals are willing to mine to barely break even, or even at a slight loss to ensure the security of the network.

The above scenario doesn't need to involve miners or actually preventing transactions from entering the blockchain. A government would just say "You can not legally accept blacklisted bitcoins" and it's up to merchants/individuals to comply.

Metcalfe's Law applies to any network, which cryptocurrenies are.
Bitcoin is more convienent than others because more merchants accept it. It's more secure because there are more miners, more people studying the source code, etc.
Network effects absolutely do matter for cryptocurrencies.

Yes, you pay the "market price" at the time your transfer completes.
However, the buy/sell spread on Coinbase can be huge if there's a lot of volatility. Right now it's $122 to sell, $165 to buy, so you might not get a great price.

Yeah, *miners*. They're the ones who get to decide which transactions are worth including in blocks because they bear the costs of processing transactions.
If including smaller transactions is worthwhile, they'll include them. Let the market decide.
As for what transactions clients allow, I think a better solution would be to allow any transaction, but show the user an estimate of how long their transaction will take to confirm, and warn the user if it will likely take a long time. This is easily computed by full nodes, and light clients could look it up.

There's nothing philosophically at odds with Bitcoin about services that securely store your Bitcoins. Call them "online wallets" if you want. You don't *need* to use them if you're confident you can securely store your own money, but I suspect most people will still want to.

I expect they will eventually open source it, once they're sure they have a critical mass of adoption.

The correction will come in the form of more miners competing, not a drop in price.
If mining profits are high, more people will start mining, increasing the difficulty, reducing profits. In a perfect market the only profitable mining rigs will the state of the art in efficiency, and located where electricity is cheapest.
Also, when BFL ships there will be many more ASICs mining, pushing the difficulty up. You're not going to be quitting your job with one ASIC.

Hardware wallets.
A device that stores your private key and uses it to only sign transactions you explicitly confirm. The private key never touches your potentially malware infested computer.
Your desktop Bitcoin client sends a transaction request to the wallet over USB (or Bluetooth or whatever). The device displays the address and amount, and requires you press a button to confirm it. The device then signs the transaction and sends it back to the client on your computer, which forwards it to the Bitcoin network.
The only vulnerability is a poorly designed hardware device that would allow extraction of the private key, or malware/man-in-the-middle attacks that swap a valid address for the attacker's address.

You can use contracts with Bitcoins themselves, or "smart property"/"colored coins" which are extremely small amounts of Bitcoins representing other property (physical or digital goods or commodities, securities, other currencies, etc). Even if the price of BTC fluctuates wildly it doesn't really matter if you chose to represent, say, a car with 0.00000001 Bitcoins (1 "Satoshi", currently worth ~$0.000005)
A real world analogy would using a marked penny for your car's title (except unforgeable and able to be sent around the world in minutes). Who cares if the value of penny itself fluctuates when the car is worth much much more?
Actually, another more realistic analogy would be how the value of the metals in coins fluctuate, but no one cares (until the value of the metals exceeds the face value, but as I mentioned, since Bitcoins are extremely divisible you can simply use a tiny fraction of a Bitcoin so it's unlikely to ever be an issue)

Peers setup basically lines of credit with each other, so you could deposit X ounces of gold with a bank, and they would enter into Ripple that they owe you X ounces of gold, which you could send to other people or exchange for other currencies/commodities.
At least that's how I understand it.
@_date: 2013-03-12 20:12:29
It's clear merchants should build automated failsafes into their systems to protect against these situations, which *shouldn't* happen but can still be protected against. Monitor the network for forks, and ignore confirmations that occur after the fork until it is resolved. Also consider stop accepting Bitcoin payments automatically after a fork of a certain length (3?) is discovered.
Note this won't protect against forks due to network splits.

Regardless of whether it's a wise investment, if people only "invest" in Bitcoin by simply buying up BTC we're not going to get very far. If you hold any amount of BTC it is in your interest to *spend* BTC, build Bitcoin services, and generally promote Bitcoin as a *currency*, not as an investment.
If you do invest in Bitcoin, please also help promote the currency.

If they bought up a significant amount then threw away the keys it would merely drive up the price, as there would just be fewer Bitcoins.
Now, if they slowly bought them up, then sold them all at once the price would crash to essentially zero, scaring people away from Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-07-02 23:42:08
Regular Bitcoin miners won't be implementing it any time soon. It will likely start out on a completely separate ZeroCoin blockchain and maybe possibly eventually be included in Bitcoin in a hard fork.
@_date: 2013-03-14 16:41:24
The current situation certainly looks better, but that doesn't mean we're not in a bubble. If it crashed today to $1 you'd agree we were in a bubble, and maybe 2 yeas from now we'd look at the chart again and say the same thing we're saying now.
TL;DR you can always make graphs that fit your hypothesis

I don't really like this approach because it requires users maintain an account with a particular payment processor. Since users don't want to have a bunch of different accounts then monopolies will form due to the network effects, just like Visa/MasterCard/etc, driving up fees and locking in merchants and customers.

I know 100 trades per second seems like a lot compared to MtGox's 17 or whatever, but it's still pathetically low for an exchange.  You should be targeting 10s of thousands.
Could you do some benchmarks and let us know what it's actually capable of?
@_date: 2013-06-20 14:25:06
And then you sell the BTC for dollars at a different exchange, decreasing demand for BTC and lowering the price...
Just because people can't withdrawal from MtGox doesn't mean they can't sell.

If I understand this correctly, they won't ship hardware in Dec, Jan, or Feb in order to keep the hash rate low enough for existing shipped devices to profit.
...unless any of their competitors continue to ship devices during that period, in which case they'll ship units anyway.
...which their competitors are highly likely to do, making this statement meaningless.

Buying some bitcoin is nice, but once you've done that the best way to help ensure bitcoin succeeds is to build infrastructure and tools that make Bitcoin easier and more powerful. If you sell something, try to accept Bitcoin. Convince receptive merchants to accept bitcoins. Don't just be a speculator.
@_date: 2013-03-20 19:29:26
Individuals and businesses who want to avoid deflation can just immediately convert to/from their currency of choice.
Merchant services like Coinbase and BitPay make this trivial.
As the currency stabilizes (years from now) merchants can begin pricing their products/services in BTC.

Depends on how big you see Bitcoin getting. Some say [$100,000-1,000,000]( but that's really long term.
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:02:04
Exchange rates stabilizing mean that people will be ok transacting in BTC. Some maybe choose to continue to exchange for USD immediately, others may prefer holding in BTC, and paying their suppliers in BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:49:34
What I mean is there would be nothing forcing every exchange to use "discrete double auction", and I suspect people would gravitate towards the most "realtime" exchange otherwise they'd risk making bad trades.

And where do you store the key you used to encrypt it? Why not just store your original keys there?
If it's encrypted with a paraphrase how is this much more secure than a brainwallet? Since you told us approximately when you did this we can narrow it down to a few dozen (hundred?) blocks, and maybe further narrow it down based on what the data looks like.

Every hash attempted is independent from each other, so there's not really any difference between incrementing the nonce and changing the set of transactions included, right?
Plus miners don't have to actually change the transactions until a new block is found.
I guess I don't understand what your comment was referring to.

@_date: 2013-05-20 06:56:26
True, there would be lots of other problems, but Bitcoin would be in a particularly bad position if ECDSA was suddenly and unexpectedly broken. Knowledge of private keys is equivalent to ownership of cryptocurrencies, whereas other financial systems have records tying funds to bank accounts/names/etc.
If someone were able to figure out your private keys there's no way of sorting out the true owner.
Of course such an attacker couldn't just steal *all* Bitcoins for themselves, because then they'd be worthless. But they could try to steal significant amounts. Or they could intentionally destroy Bitcoin by publishing every private key.

Interesting writeup, thanks. These are basically the same arguments against using client-side web wallets like Blockchain.
"Provably fair" can certainly be done correctly if the user runs a client they 100% control and can audit, aside from the stalling exploit. Even that might be solvable with homomorphic encryption (edit: or maybe just using some combination of digital signatures)
I wonder if you could write a browser extension to audit a "probably fair" casino website. The extension would sit in the background, monitoring all HTTP requests, independently verifying all bets, and detecting and reporting stalled games.
I'm also not even convinced their cryptography is sound. The use of Mersenne Twister instead of a CSPRNG is suspicious. The client only has 32 bits to shuffle. I wonder if they could precompute slightly biased server seeds, and then reuse them over and over?
One way to mitigate that attack is to require the seed be combined with the most recent Bitcoin block hash or something. That way they'd have at most ~10 minutes to compute biased seeds. Also, they could publish every seed publicly so they can't be reused.
But really they should just use actual cryptographic primitives, and let the client seed be larger. Why not make the client and server seeds 256 bits each, XOR them together, and use that to shuffle?
@_date: 2013-04-06 18:47:16
I'm not exactly sure what you're asking.
Bitcoins can still be sent to your addresses even if your client/wallet is offline.
However, you should read about the problem [Deterministic Wallets]( solve. I believe Bitcoin QT **does not** support deterministic wallets. In that case, you need to regularly backup wallet.dat, otherwise newly generated addresses won't be available in your offline backup.

I don't really know, I'm just wondering if the two types of exchanges can coexist, or whether DDA only works if it's the only kind of exchange, and thus must be mandated by regulation of some kind.
