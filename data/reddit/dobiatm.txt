I subscribe and read the news regularly. Because it covers an overview of world event. But yes, I agree with your words of its falling libertarianl. I regard it as a good news source but don’t believe in everything reported.
And I personally don’t agree with what it the fear control opinion. But it does bring me some thought of thinking in the opposite\~\~\~\~

Well. I just keep an rational thinking of some media's report like The economist.

Cannot agree more. There is a long way to go for wide use and recognition of blockchain.

Does the limit problem solved? Usually the operator set the trading limit. The quickest way is to contact them directly. Bitcoin ATM Operators earn profit from the bitcoin trading and the fees from withdrawing or buying. Low limit means poor money liquidity and low fee income. Just go and contact them.

Yes. you're right. It is. But seeing from the global polices in different countries, there're many governments who still take a very cautious stance. Besides, as for the wide use of blockchain, it's still at the beginning stage.
I actually meant about freedom in blockchain. Like how long it will take for a real decentralized exchange? I personally think there is still a lot to be done.
All above is my opinion. \`\`\`\`\`\`

Didn't notice the date. Anyway, glad to hear it was solved finally.
