first - if anybody is trying to implement this early version into woo commerce storefront, can we start a group to share our notes?  This sounds like the answer to my prayers as of late assuming I understand whats happening here:
Somebody correct me if I'm wrong here:
- Wanted a solution for woo commerce (or any commerce storefront system) that had no middleman whatsoever, allowed full private key control and was stable.
- I was shocked to find only two solutions that met this criteria (please add to this list if I'm missing any):
 - bitcoinway.com - plugin for woo commerce called Bitcoin Payments for Woocommerce - uses elec v1.9.8 MPK and blockchain.info API to present store sale with unique wallet and then accept the payment directly to storeowners electrum wallet.
 - bitshop SCI - btcfreak.info has a storefront script as well as the php shopping cart component that generated unique addresses per purchase and then allowed store owner to sweep the list of private keys into a wallet later.  I was never quite clear on how this worked but I am pretty sure its using blockchains get wallet functions.
Both had their weaknesses tho which I've been trying to resolve since.  Wound up going with  bitcoinway / german's woo commerce plugin.  But found that there were things that needed updating to get to where we wanted to be such as:
1. upgrading to use electrum v2 new mpk format
2. the confirmation checking + order status + the way the cronjob handled those things.  It works and its manageable but wanted more flexibility.  For example, our rule for PAID would ideally be: Order amount due = Wallet Balance (or total amount paid)
It wouldn't even care about the confirmations at that point.  But rather the goal being to get the customer checked out and feeling secure that their order is PAID.
- Then later on, during order fulfillment, we wanted some action button to be available that would do a final check on all OPEN/NOT SHIPPED and PAID orders that would then display the confirmation count + maybe the TX 
- And UNPAID orders would be double checked to see if the balance was still not equal to the order total due.
From a quick look at mycelium gear, it seems like this is going to give all that + more.  Am I right about this type of use?  Im a bit new to this type of web developing but am starting to get the hang of whats happening under the hood.
I will also say that i spent ALOT of time researching boxed / available solutions and was absolutely shocked at how little love the decentralized solutions get and how few they really are.  It seemed like everything had a middleman - sometimes playing a tiny role and sometimes playing a big role taking small or big commission chunks, etc.  Bitpay coinable, etc seem to have woo commerce solutions that are up to date.  WTF is this.. people need to support the decentralized solutions if they expect solutions.  Im not a fan on these crowd sourcing projects that tend to become vaporware.  But once a person/place has shown some work product and history, we won't get cool, truly decentralized solutions unless they are financially supported. 
Ive never been a big fan of mycelium but i believe its because I'm IOS and not android user.  But I do see some of the projects they have and I can see why they get the praise they do.

I think the big difference between 99% of the solutions + gear is the middleman touching money.
Perhaps coin simple can clarify as I may be mistaken in my understanding - 
but is there an option in coin simple wordpress commerce plugin to allow a merchant to directly receive their payments without a middleman touching the money during payment?  
With very very few exceptions, all these payment gateways differ in the respect that somebody is in the middle of the buyer and the merchant.  Bitpay, coinbase, etc etc.  This may be fine for some people as they pay a commission and get (or at least should get) support and a consistent updated piece of software.
With projects like gear (or bitcoinway's plugin for woo commerce), u may have ZERO middleman activity or charges but u run a risk that the plugin doesn't get supported the way it should.  Open source projects are cool but if the upkeep and support aren't "free".  Unless u have a crowdfunded effort / some way of keeping money fed into the project support, u lose the middleman-less projects.
Look at the bitcoinway woo commerce plugin.  This thing basically lets one of the most popular ecommerce storefronts accept payments using electrum MPK.  And it works (albeit off the old v1.9.8 mpk format).  But the amount of interest in trying to get people to donate towards updating it is basically ZERO.  Sucks but this is how most of these cool open source / middleman-less apps wind up which is why people have to go with solutions involving middlemen like bitpay, coinable.
Coinsimple - do u guys have any thoughts on this?  U guys make a plugin that lets people easily select their middleman.  But why not also offer some option that involves no middleman (like using blockchains api and electrum mpk)?  That'd seem like something that'd be more in Gear's ballpark, no?  
And why would somebody not go with bitpay directly if they used woo commerce for example?  Is it because coin simple builds more flexibility on top of bitpays payment processing?
Don't take these questions as negative by any means.. Im just trying to understand more about these options as it relates to payment processing and e-commerce.  It gets a lil confusing looking at:
- Gear
- Bitpay
- Coinbase
- Coinsimple
- Blockchain.info
- GoUri
- Bitcoinway
I know the easy way is bitpay/coinbase and/or some partner of bitpay/coinbase but it just all seems paypal-like at that point.

My main question is whether anybody besides buyer and seller ever have control of the bitcoin?  i would say thats the biggest differentiator if people build plugins for all the common ecommerce storefronts like woocommerce etc and they work consistently as expected.
Coinsimple - can you confirm whether you offer an option to have p2p money handling or is temporary control by another party unavoidable?  Id prefer to collect bitcoin directly and then cash out to fiat seperately when needed.  Does your woocommerce plugin give me this option?  If so, i think its a service worth paying for to meet my requirements.  Not crazy about percentage based payment processing but would consider a nice plugin that worked consistently to be worth it until something just as good and flat fee priced to be more economical comes along.
I just cant tell if some of these plugins touch the money in the middle.
Im not sure mycellium confirmed woocommerce plugin but i plan to check out their beta plugins to see what their woocommerce plugin might do if once beta is complete.v right now, they dont have a production capable plugin for woocommerce that meets my needs either.
Nobody does escept a free open source plugin thats a bit outdated.  And maybe coinsimple - lets see what they say?
