Because it’s practically the exact opposite of the truth.
Freedom of speech: Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, r/the_donald, Conservatives on campus. How about your fellow libs calling for Bezos to buy Twitter to “shut down Trump.” 
Freedom of the Press: Obama’s admin literally wiretapped journalists.
Freedom of Religion: Obama admin mandated the *Little Sisters of the Poor* insure abortifacients for elderly Catholic nuns. 
Free markets: Obamacare. 
Everyone believes in civil rights, democratic societies, secular governments, gender equality and international cooperation. These are not “Liberal” views.

Everyone meaning liberals and conservatives 
@_date: 2018-04-13 09:19:06
That definition has nothing whatsoever to do w. Liberals in our political sense and you know it. Don’t be cynical.

Which prominent conservatives don’t believe in civil rights?
