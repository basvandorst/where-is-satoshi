The rebuy option at coinbase is a fantastically clever for them. If you "pay with bitcoin and rebuy" on coinbase, then
* Coinbase sends USD to the merchant,
* Coinbase pulls USD from your bank account,
* Coinbase still charges you fees,
* and no bitcoin balance ever changes at all.
It's at best a gimmick used to convince bitcoin holders to promote Coinbase and grow their market share as an usual payment processor.

More merchants can make it attractive for more users. But not with usual merchants.
For the vast majority of purchases, paying with cash, credit card or Paypal is easier and faster than buying bitcoin for the first time. Nobody is going to learn how to get into bitcoin to get a 2-20% discount on pizza - the effort and exchange fees are not worth it. The current push for more merchants makes it possible for people *who already have bitcoin* to spend them, but it's not enough to convince everyone else to buy bitcoin instead of just entering their credit card number.
The one advantage bitcoin has is reasonably high privacy for online payments, so the merchants have to be of the kind where people really value privacy over their effort: *porn*. "Anonymous porn money" is one angle that could actually attract more everyday users to buy bitcoin to keep their subscriptions form appearing on their credit card bills.

PayPal is actually pretty fantastic for consumers, as they tend to side with buyers and give a full refund if there is a dispute.
That's not so great for merchants. But it does mean I can order stuff from a random eBay seller in China without having to worry about getting scammed, whereas I'd never risk doing business with them without such insurance.

Then I guess you could just leave fewer tips? If you gave people 9 cents as a tip in real life, it would be taken as an insult not a gift.

The fiat lock makes sense as soon as they think that they might not find funding to cover all losses.
If you can't cover all debts with assets, or at least *highly probable* future income, then you are bankrupt, and must stop trading ASAP under UK and probably under Slovenian law.
A bankruptcy judge will then decide how to split remaining assets between creditors and customers. I would guess that they would order an even split of losses between both USD and bitcoin accounts.
If Bitstamp started refunding 100% of USD accounts, and a judge later decided that it should have been 90% for everyone, then they would be in a world of shit.
