There is no definitive answer to that question right now. How to explain the answer when the question currently doesn't have an answer?
Right now pro-bitcoin people say no bubble, anti-bitcoin/crypto say it's a bubble. How to know the truth when both sides is bias? Neutrals are stuck not knowing what to think. It's hard to get an answer to this because it is unknown territory.

I can say what I like, this is the internet.

Did I say I was investing in Bitcoin? I just follow it because it's interesting.

It's so easy to say that, just like it's easy to say it will rise to $1m by 2020. Who knows what will happen?

Same also, unless you have money to burn I wouldn't suggest it.
If you want to buy into bitcoin because you support its original motives then that's a whole different matter. 
The fact people see bitcoin as an investment platform now than it's original intention is somewhat indicative to me that this *might* be a bubble. I do think it's overvalued but by how much I am not sure.

In my world $500 is still $500, still a significant chunk of money for me.

Exactly, we have no idea because it's new. The only thing we have to judge is the traditional methods. I am a safe investor so I use these. I follow Bitcoin because I am truly intrigued to how it will play out as it will set a precedent for the years ahead.
Personally I see Ripple as being the true long term success crypto from my research.

It's gone from around $6k to $10k in 15 days. It's not normal.

Your bitcoin amount x 500,000.
No offense, but do you know what you're doing?

I am also a CS graduate. Don't worry I know also.

Normal compared to standard stock investments.
I see bitcoin working the same as stocks personally. That may not be the case, but it's how I see it. Nothing like this happens without consequence. It *will* be costing people money while others get rich, because of that some will likely happen. Whether it's through regulation or something else.
But I could be wrong, I am no expert.
