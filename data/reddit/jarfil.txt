Hello [Mr. Strawman]( Of course encryption works, it just doesn't work *the way you say it*.
Providing someone with encrypted content, the decryption key and the decryption algorithm, so they can decrypt the content, may be a great way to prove your authorship of the content, yet it's still a piss poor way of trying to stop them from copying such content.
Don't believe me? Go ahead, try and stop me from copying the cryptographically secured blockchain, let's see what happens.

If **all** miners suddenly started broadcasting blocks not recognized by the majority of verifying nodes... they could paralyze the network, effectively holding it hostage.
The difficulty calculation is not flexible enough to recover from a sudden massive drop in difficulty, it would take a very long time for newcomers to mine 2016 blocks to force a recalculation and it would only drop to 1/4 of the previous difficulty, so the next 2016 would take (very long)/4, which could still be very long. That would probably make prices plummet and make it not worth to mine at all.
However, if only 90% of the miners did that, while the remaining 10% of miners would only mine blocks at 1/10 of the rate for the next up to 2016 blocks, surely impacting the network... it wouldn't be that long before the difficulty went to 1/4, making them earn 4x what they were earning before, and 2016 blocks later things would come back to normal, just with those 10% of miners becoming the new 100% of miners.
Of course even in the worst case scenario, verifying nodes could just decide to update their rules and accept blocks with, let's say 1/1000 the previous difficulty, making it profitable to mine for some newcomers, and the old miners could do nothing about that... unless they colluded with the exchanges, which right now is where most of bitcoin's value lies. In a world where people could live by earning and spending just bitcoin, no amount of collusion could bring it down, though.

Depends on how you look at it. Bitcoin is not likely to ever reach a value of $1 million, so there is no way it will increase by a factor of one million like it did from $0.01 to $10K. But if it became popular enough, it could still go to over $100K. Unless something like Facebook's coins come in and sweep over the use cases.

SegWit needs better infographics explaining the concept, not so much further study. I agree that it won't solve much on itself, though.
What I do wonder, is if the concept could be extended further, to subdividing the transaction data and signature data into smaller blocks themselves.
Since the main problem for miners is the time it takes for blocks to propagate, what if they could pre-propagate the transaction data and signature data of the blocks they are working on, so clients could keep them in cache, then send just the final hash which would propagate at blazing speeds across the network. Or clients could use the transaction data and signature data in their mempool to reconstruct the blocks.

Hm, 8MB to 8 peers in 30 seconds isn't all that much, it's just 17Mbps. I have 30Mbps upload at home, not far from where I live people are getting 200Mbps upload, and most hosting services have been going above the 200Mbps for some time already.
What would be the impact on the Bitcoin network if some nodes were only able to upload to just 1-2 peers in 30 seconds, while other nodes were able to upload to like 100 peers in the same time?
@_date: 2015-12-10 04:04:15
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:25:31


That is not correct. The signature data is still part of the blockchain, still needed to verify transactions as valid. What SegWit does is to separate both parts (transaction data, signature) on the wire, so they can be sent and received independently.
It really doesn't affect security at all, it would be really stupid of clients to accept un-signed transaction data as valid. It does help however if they want to ditch the signature data for some older blocks once they have verified the latest transactions... but really, clients could do that right now, it's just that they would not be able to collaborate in the p2p network with any blocks they locally stripped signatures from.

There is really little "storing value" utility in a highly volatile asset. I get it, everyone is expecting for the true potential to materialize, but until bitcoin's value starts consistently going up, for now it's just speculation whether that value will be stored or lost.
@_date: 2018-08-08 06:33:55
In a world where all money was replaced with just 21M bitcoins, the value of those bitcoins would reflect the size of the economy, which keeps growing as population keeps growing, increasing both production and demand. The closer Bitcoin gets to that, the less volatility and the more stable growth it will experience. I think censorship resistance is just a tiny part of that value.
And ETH... that's an interesting case. Its smart contacts are already much more useful than Bitcoin, but it's being managed in such a shady way that I still can't figure out whether it will crash and burn spectacularly, or have a very real chance of overshadowing BTC.

It's not supposed to scale with technology, but with bitcoin adoption.
If it only scaled with technology, that would be equivalent to saying "bitcoin has been adopted enough, and we don't want any more adoption but to just maintain our current level". So I would say Moore's law should be the _minimum_ reasonable value, as that would be just keeping up with technology.
But in order to accommodate a higher level of adoption, it should be much higher than Moore's law.
On the other hand, an argument could be made that none of this is needed at all, with starvation of available transactions and increasing fees being a desirable outcome. This way most "frivolous" transactions would be culled, aggregated value transfers could still operate mostly uninfluenced, while smaller, more frequent, and/or more localized transactions being run at secondary operators or with altcoins.

It's more like the other way around: nodes decide which transactions to include in new blocks, while miners just do whatever the nodes tell/allow them. Nowadays, due to skyrocketing difficulty, miners kind of have the say, but still just as far as the node they are mining for will allow them.
Of course, if you get enough miners (like, become a pool), you can... well, make a 51% attack on the network, sure. Also you could get enough nodes, and become Dogecoin, or any of the others ;)

If the network were to move to a different crypto, wouldn't ALL previous coins lose value instantaneously?
I imagine if something like switching crypto primitives was to happen, there would be some kind of transition period, like a year, after which no more transactions with the previous crypto would be honored. This probably would happen long before any break in the old crypto was found, so by the time it was actually found, those coins would already be useless.

That would be "$330 in BTC plus heat your home" in exchange for "$400 in electricity", which would get the balance down to those "$70 in gas".
The point is that to pull out a ROI by just mining, you need to get **more** $ in BTC than whatever $ in electricity you spend, as you need to break even + amortize the hardware. While if you are using that heat for something else, you can still get a ROI even by getting **fewer** $ in BTC than whatever $ you spend on electricity.

Not really.
Users can at any moment decide to follow the policy, working with just the signaling miners and leaving the non-signaling ones behind.
The fact that right now users are waiting for 95% of the hash power to signal, should be seen more as a polite gesture so we can all reach consensus, rather than as something binding that miners get to decide.
Don't forget that even when 95% of the hash power is signalling, there will be a 5% that will be just thrown out until they update their nodes; there is really nothing stopping users from making that 5% a 45%, other than the fact that it would noticeably reduce the hash power of the whole network... but at some point, even that could be worth it.

Like, what if you were to buy a large ice machine, a very inefficient one if possible, and you started selling ice? Then if someone asked, you could say it's the ice machine using all that power, you could provide receipts —some real and maybe some fake if you want to risk it— for the ice you sold, and you could say that whatever ice you produced and didn't sell, just melted and was just lost... while actually using all that power to mine bitcoin.
Woodworking machinery, electric ovens, and pretty much any high-consumption low-yield electric machines, could all be used in similarly creative ways.

The year 2015 will be like no other before it.
Looking backwards to the last year's encouraging development towards a sweet spot in growth rate,
we observe a positive current balance in reform of stale leftovers from scandals towards an evolution of development that will reinforce the financial effectiveness of lump-sum spending. Recovery from the faltering pace of building a framework within alleged acquisitions will justify the uncomfortable fact that as an investment market this will be characterized by a deficit spending, contrary to the negative equity balance of a stalled mining policy likely to decline as the year progresses.
As such, making the week's payroll will be positively affected by leveraging the synergies of Bitcoin
investment alongside sustainable planning assuming current trends continue.

I think you missed the next line where I pretty much wrote exactly that.
It also doesn't change the fact that each fork is centralized around whoever has the commit permissions for that fork, so 100-ish developers having each their own fork is "distributed", while all of them synchronizing with a single central repo is "centralized".
The point being: it doesn't matter whether it's 10 or 100 developers, it's how they work that matters.
This data, a simple list of contributors, shows none of that.

As a closed system, maybe.

After you grow out of your 1U, there is no difference between managing redundant datacenters, and managing redundant AWS infrastructures. You will be imaging every physical machine pretty much as you would an AWS instance, if you don't go the hypervisor route and just manage instances everywhere.
SLAs are not much different in both cases either.
As for big companies going cloud, it has a name: consultants. They will be going back to their "local cloud" (sic) when the next fad strikes.
Only practical reason to use the cloud is the (down)scaling. If you can provision your minimum requirements with dedicated servers, then prepare a cloud infrastructure to offload peak workloads, it makes more sense than to overprovision your servers and then find out you did not overprovision them nearly enough.
But if you are smaller than 1U... then sure, you can go AWS, you can go VPS, shared hosting, or whatever.

The customer can replace any RBF transaction with a non-replaceable non-RBF transaction, just by specifying seq=maxint-1 in the new transaction.

If I send you a transaction with an output to one of your addresses, and at the same time send 9 more transactions spending the same inputs to some of my addresses... what are the chances that you will get paid?
If instead I send 999 more transactions with outputs to my addresses, do you still think you have many chances for the transaction with outputs to your address getting through before the other ones do?
Sure, right now 0-conf is not 100% reversible, just 90%, 99.9%, or "however many transactions I am willing to spam %" reversible. I don't think this justifies prohibiting transactions being updated before they get confirmed.

1. Go to 
1. Click on the last block
1. CTRL+F and search for "115EytJ2X"
1. If none found, click on the Previous Block and repeat
1. When you find a coincidence, make sure it's the destination address and it ends with "cVDsb4Ysvr".
We know the first 9 and the last 10 characters of the address. This is a total of 19*log(58)/log(2) =  111.3 bits. If we discount the 1st leading byte for network version, and the last 4 bytes [used for checksum]( we are left with 71.3 bits of the address itself. So there is less than 1 in 2^71.3 chance of a false positive.
But really, the checksum is based on the *whole* address, so we can really count it against false positives, lowering that to just a 1 in 2^103.3 chance.
If we add the fact that we know the exact value of the transaction, and we can suspect that it's a recent one, there is a really high chance that that's the one.

The point is that you pay ONE transaction fee, for UP TO INFINITE transactions on the channel, WITHOUT losing control over your money at any moment.
Off-chain works perfectly well for a trust-less network of channels from point A to point N.

You have to "soft tie" some funds, in the sense that the more you fund an LN channel and the more of those funds you use over LN, the cheaper the average transaction cost will become, since you only pay one transaction fee for the whole channel... but you can decide to close the channel at any moment if you need to use the remaining funds for something else.

No, and no.
Lightning is totally decentralized, you can create a side *channel* (not side-chain) with anyone at any moment, and tear it down the same way.
Side channels are basically a single bitcoin transaction, exactly as secure as any other bitcoin transaction, backed up by the whole bitcoin blockchain.
Worst thing that can happen is that you disagree with the other channel party and you close the channel before using up all the funds in there, effectively paying a single bitcoin transaction fee for transacting fewer funds than you expected to transact.

Opening a channel doesn't cost a tx fee; the tx is only transmitted when the channel gets closed.
When creating a channel, it gets funded by someone, and it doesn't make sense for a merchant to fund a channel with a client, so the merchant has nothing to lose.
If 20.000 clients were to open a channel each with a merchant, they would have to fund each of those channels with some amount, the merchant wouldn't have to do anything, the clients would have to pay a tx fee if they ever wanted to see their money back... or if they waited until the channels expired, the merchant could choose the ones with more funds on them than the cost of the tx fees to close them, get a profit, then forget about the rest.

Yes, submitting a LN TX to the blockchain, by either part, effectively closes the channel. That's why you don't want to open random LN channels with random people, only with counterparts you expect to conduct business with, be it directly or by using them as intermediate hops to reach whoever you need.
It's to be expected that with time there might emerge a network of reputable LN intermediaries who will let people open LN channels with them. Then people could use those LN channels pretty much like pre-paid credit cards, sending and receiving funds on them, but with the certainty of always being able to retrieve them by just closing the channel.

How can they be fixed? If people didn't want to buy Yuan at whatever price they set, they wouldn't sell any, so the rates would either go down a bit or down to "0/nobody cares". China can only offer printing more Yuan for the same amount of USD, but that's again onto whoever takes them on the offer to figure out whether it makes sense to buy any Yuan at all.
The US may not be directly fixing the exchange rates, but that's just a way to make people think they have some freedom when in reality it directly fixes the Fed's interest rates which in turn make the USD more or less desirable. It's just "fixing with intermediaries".

There are no "coins" as separate entities, all there is are wallets with some balance (a number). The term bit"coin" is just to make it sound money-ish, nothing more.
You would know when someone took some "bitcoins" from a wallet, depending on the kind of wallet you use. There are web wallets that have different alert mechanisms (email, sms, etc.), but on the bitcoin network itself there would appear a transaction stating that some amount of "bitcoin" is transferred from the original wallet to some other wallet.
This transaction would appear instantly, but it would need to propagate throughout the bitcoin network, with nodes confirming its validity as they see it. Usually people don't consider transactions to be truly effective until at least three nodes verify them as correct, so depending on your monitoring service you could get informed a bit sooner or a bit later.
Since all this is public, you could trace the transactions back to some origin, or if you know a certain transaction was a robbery, you could trace them forward to see what wallet ends up with the balance. Problem is, wallets are anonymous and very easy to create, so most probably you wouldn't be able to determine who the culprit was, or even which wallet(s) is(are) his.

There are people clamoring for such a split... but even if it were to come to that, from a practical point of view you don't really have to worry about that until it actually happens: if you were to buy some bitcoin today, and the split were to happen tomorrow, you would end up having your bitcoin **duplicated on both chains**. So even if one of them were to drop in value all the way down to zero, you would always keep your bitcoin on the other one.
The only real danger would be to buy bitcoinA or bitcoinB just after the split, while both alternatives still had a chance to win or lose, because if you were to buy the losing one... well, that would be bad.
Of course it's probable that for some time after the split both bitcoinA and bitcoinB would lose some value, so most rational people don't want to see that scenario play out.

It doesn't really work like that. There is no rigging of the odds in Steam's favor, since it isn't Steam who controls the items' prices and it isn't Steam who's paying you for them, it's the other users themselves. You can buy however many keys you want, put the items on sale for the total cost of the keys, and Steam won't stop you from breaking even.
Or you could put the items for sale at $0.01 each and lose it all... or try to sell them at $100 each, and it will be other users, not Steam, who will decide whether they think those items are worth that or not. And they might be completely wrong and pay much more than what would be reasonable according to the odds of finding those items in the crates.
All Steam does is get a fee on every transaction, so the more you make (from other players), the more they are making too.

The merchant can:
1. Accept 0-conf non-RBF transactions, hoping that the transaction will ultimately —some day— be included in the blockchain.
2. Accept n-conf RBF transactions (with n &gt; 0), being sure that once the transactions have been included in the blockchain, they can not be replaced anymore.
3. Be a total moron and honor 0-conf RBF transactions, that can be rewritten a thousand times before they get included in the blockchain.
4. Be paranoid and only accept n-conf non-RBF transactions, which are already included in the blockchain, and offer the same security as n-conf RBF transactions.

The problem is that any debt, has to be paid back. Having to pay back more than what you make, leads to bankruptcy, to people not wanting to take your word anymore that you will pay them back... because you literally can't no matter how much you'd want to.
Same happens to countries. A country has to pay interests on its debt, if those interests are higher than what the country is making —essentially through taxes— then it won't be able to pay back that debt no matter what, and people will no longer want to lend it money. With markets being as they are, it's quite easy for panic to extend and suddenly no one wanting to lend them money at all.
So it isn't exactly "how much debt", but more "how does it evolve" over time. Is the country paying back its debt, or just asking for more and more all the time? If it isn't interested in reducing its debt, is it because they want to expand it while still being able to pay it off in the future, or are they expanding it because they are running out of money?
Of course a country can do what the US is doing, namely pour that debt into the military and use it as leverage for the rest of the world to "trust" the US... not to bomb their asses off. Combine that with a very low interest rate, and you can essentially get all the money you want, not pay it back, and just threaten with killing anyone who comes asking for it.
Except, you know what usually happens to people who do that? They end up in jail, or beaten to a pulp.

To "suffer", a receiver would need to act upon that transaction... but there is nothing that would force them to do so, neither before nor after the patch.
If you receive a 0-conf RBF transaction and you want to give a cup of coffee for it, that's your right and your decision whether to take that risk or not (and wait for some confirmations or a non-RBF replacement transaction).

Which keys do you trust? Do you know all the keys you have on your computer? Do you trust all the entities whose keys your browser trusts to sign other keys? Who do you trust to check those keys?
In the 90s there was a limit on the length (aka: strength) of the keys exported from the US, since the longer ones were classified as "weapons". Incidentally the weak ones ended up being the only kind of keys anyone would use, even in the US. Because, you know, the Internet is kind of global, and it was kind of easier to have the same kind of keys for everyone.

The thing is, CP has several actors bundled under the same laws:
* A kid
* Someone forcing the kid... or not, whatever
* Someone getting paid... or not, whatever
* Someone paying... or not, whatever
* Someone uploading the content
* Someone downloading the content
* Someone "consuming" the content
Current laws bundle everything up, except for the kid, under the same definition of "guilty", which leads to retarded stuff like teens sending nude selfies and getting convicted of self-CP, or cases like this where the FBI distributes content created by someone else and they become the "guilty" party.

You can only cancel a transaction if:
* you send it with replace-by-fee enabled
* AND *before* the *first* verification on the blockchain
Without RBF, you can't cancel it. You could still try to send a colliding transaction and "hope" for some miner to pick it up, but unless you are colluding with a noticeable percentage of the total hashpower, your chances are slim.
Once it gets verified, you can't cancel it. Technically you could "try" to cancel it, but unless the verification block gets orphaned, any verification gets pretty much written in stone.
That's from the sender's point of view. From the receiver's point of view, you want to wait for the transaction to get "verified x amount of times" so the chances of the sender somehow cancelling it are "slim to the power of x".

It's very much alike.
If you're familiar with Git, commits are organized in a chain, with each commit referencing a previous commit, forming a history/branch. A fork in git is two commits referencing the same previous commit, meaning the branch splits into two after some point.
In Bitcoin, the blockchain is much like a Git branch, with each block being like a commit, referencing a previous block. The main difference is that every block is signed in a way that requires a lot of computational effort —which is not required in Git— so after a few blocks are chained one after another and signed each on its own, it becomes extremely difficult to modify any of them and still keep the signatures valid. The signing process is also distributed, so people (miners) compete with each other to see who gets to be the first one to come up with a valid signature... and the process of deciding which signature is valid, is also distributed, which a series of rules coded into the software that accepts or rejects blocks which meet them or don't, thus deciding whether to use them or not as the base block for the next one.
A fork in the blockchain is quite similar to a fork in a git branch: at some point, two or more people create blocks that would follow the same original block.
Normally, only one of these blocks would be picked as "the next block", based on the rules coded in the software... but if some people are running different software versions with modified rules, then some people might pick one block, while other people might pick another and keep building their chain upon it. This leads to a fork in the blockchain, to people potentially receiving several kinds of blocks and only accepting the ones that match their blockchain and the rules their software is enforcing to build upon, with a blockchain that is united up to a point, and splits/forks/branches from some point onwards.

There is no "your money" on the blockchain, and no "your wallet" either. It's only outputs that you can reference while signing a transaction with a matching key such that it lets someone else (or yourself) sign another transaction in turn. Wallets are just how we call the place where keys are being saved, not where any of the money actually exists (which is... essentially nowhere).
You are free to create a transaction consolidating all the inputs you are allowed to use in a single output to yourself, though.

You can license your work under whatever conditions you want, but so can people turn away from you when the conditions don't meet their interests, or would require an uncertain interpretation by some unknown judge to get applied.
Right now the GPLv3 has language that does something like this, requiring the recipients of the software to not enforce any possible patents they might have against the creator of the software for as long as they want to keep using it.
This on itself is a point that turns many people away from the GPLv3. I can't even begin to imagine how other self-defense clauses would impact the adoption of a license.

Gold is also a good valuable on itself: it doesn't oxidize, it's easy to work with, it's a good electrical conductor, it's somewhat scarce, it's shiny, and it's fungible and divisible which makes it great to be used as a currency.
Of course part of its current value comes from speculation, and what essentially is trust in others trusting in its value, but even if all that was to disappear, gold would never reach zero value.
I don't personally think that money backed by gold is a good thing, I think it's good to keep money and goods separated. The only thing I see as problematic with fiat is who has control over its value: is it the people using it like Bitcoin, or some sort of central authority like the USD?

But we already know that they perform quite poorly for mining, so what is the point of these mining chips at all? I'll tell you: there is none.

The answer is about the ? not making much sense. There is no "new version" place to send BTC to, just the same blockchain, which now contains both non-segwit and segwit blocks.
If you really wish for the BTC you control to be registered in a segwit block, you can move them to any Bitcoin address and this transaction will be registered in a segwit block, with the same fee as any other Bitcoin transaction... but I don't see what would you gain by doing that.

1) The only moment your coins might be at risk is if UASF activates AND you make any transaction *after* that but *before* one of the chains clearly wins the market. Any transactions before UASF activation, or if it doesn't activate, or on a clearly winning chain, are as safe as ever.
2) All "old coins" will always be valid, even if Bitcoin were to split. You don't need to "convert" anything. The only risk is getting new coins on a chain that would fade away, which you can easily avoid by just waiting and seeing which one becomes the winner. If you plan to hodl, there is no reason to touch them at all.
3) If UASF fails, nothing will happen right away, just a loss of credibility in Bitcoin's ability to scale in the future. Market value could still go up, down or whatever, since Bitcoin still has the biggest amount of hashpower securing its transactions, but it could end up being sort of a secondary settlement network for some altcoin(s) more suitable for higher transaction volumes... which over time could overtake Bitcoin, but it wouldn't happen overnight.

Sell when you need the money, not when it hits some arbitrary value. If bitcoin gets really popular, it can go to 10k, or 100k, or 1M, and you wouldn't want to miss that just because you decided "10k" was good enough.

That's like saying it's "eggs that you can trade over the internet", or "dollars that you can trade over the internet". Bitcoin is none of those things, it shares some qualities with all of them, but at the same time differs from all of them in more than just being tradeable over the internet.

Bitcoin doesn't *require* identification, but the transactions are 100% public.
Which means if you ever let your identity get linked to any transaction —like, exchanging the bitcoin for money that goes into your bank account, or buying something in your name with it— anyone with that information can see all the other incoming and outgoing transactions from that address.
So if you can prove that the bitcoin on some address belonged to you, and now everyone can see that "you" transferred them to some other address which you can prove belongs to your friend, and there is no contract your friend can provide to explain why those bitcoin are now under their control... that's pretty much like your friend waltzing off from your house with your TV; it "might" have been a gift, but if you ask for it back and they don't return it, it will be considered stealing.

Personally, I'm betting on bitcoin or some other cryptocoin to become the currency of the future, or an ecosystem of cryptocurrencies. I don't think *all* of them will crash, the whole concept of cryptocurrencies is far superior to any previous currency concept, and I think it's here to stay, be it bitcoin or some other altcoin.
So I'm mainly sitting on it, taking some when I need it, using some to play at day trading altcoins, mining some altcoins because why not, and keeping an eye on the scaling issues in case there comes a time to jump to a better alternative. I have no point at which I'd want to sell it all for fiat, because I just think that fiat is obsolete.

That would mean it would have to go a 50% down.
I think the last time that happened was thanks to Mt. Gox, so unless there is some other exchange stealing a big chunk of the coins in circulation, it isn't probable to happen.
The other possibility would be to get definitive proof of the scaling issues being unsolvable, which would more likely tank the value altogether and you wouldn't really like to hop on that train, would you? However it rather seems like the scaling issues are being proven totally solvable, so this is also an unlikely scenario.
Don't get me wrong, I'm fully aware that what's going on right now totally looks like a bubble on its own, but it also isn't all that far from how bitcoin "should" actually scale.

There is a worst case scenario in which Bitcoin would split into SegWit and non-SegWit chains, with the non-SegWit miners dedicating part of their mining power to attack the SegWit chain.
Most people kind of agree that this scenario is rather improbable, since it would mean a net loss for everyone, but people have been known to do stupid stuff before, so it can't be completely ignored.

It's hard for me to believe that people who keep bitcoin, and then decide to keep them at an exchange, are all that "lazy or uninformed".

That, is what I call greed.

VISA is worth only part of the money they have in circulation; bitcoin would be that money, so for bitcoin to reach VISA levels it would have to go much higher.
IIRC, the theoretical limit was around a couple million per bitcoin if it reached VISA levels, and if the scalability gets truly solved once and for all, it could get even higher thanks to micro-transactions which even VISA can't handle at the moment.

It should be, but actually is not always like that.
People are notoriously bad at thinking in the long term, and don't realize their property value is going to go down to 0 at some point, when the building becomes finally condemned. People are even worse at estimating how long will it take for that to happen, and how much will it cost to maintain it in a habitable state before that.
This leads to some owners asking for rents much higher than anyone is willing to pay, even if the property ends up unoccupied and they end up losing money on it.

Bitcoin is "relatively instantaneous".
As in, if you wanted to transfer $1,000,000 from the USA to Russia, it would take you a couple days and you'd have to pay quite a chunk in transaction fees, while by using bitcoin you could get it done "relatively instantaneously" in 10 minutes and even with no fees at all.
Or if you decided to buy a pair of shoes online, the seller would get your payment in 10 minutes instead of having to wait 45 days for your credit card payment to clear.
However, if you tried to buy a bus ticket to get on the bus you had in front of you, it would still take at least 10 minutes to confirm the transaction, so either whoever sold you the ticket did it without waiting for the transaction to confirm, just by trusting you and hoping that it will indeed get confirmed in 10 minutes, or you'd be out of luck.
Unfortunately, much of the marketing forgets about the "relatively" part, and merchants forget to fully inform customers about how much time it will take to confirm, even if they do so with stuff like cheques.

Actually... I could have taken it, and even would have had a slight chance of getting away with it.
You see, I've got a dual nationality, this was in a bank in one country, but I live in another one right now, they don't really cross-check data, and I don't have an address in the first one anymore. At the time, I had my account authorized for unlimited remote fund management because I was liquidating some stuff there, so I possibly could have transferred the lump sum anywhere I wanted. It probably would have taken them little time to notice it though, so I would have ended up with a (huge) negative balance, but they would probably have had to ask the Interpol just to find me. In the meantime, I could have bounced that money to some other accounts, hoping to stay a step ahead of however they would try to lock it, until I potentially could have ended cashing out a big chunk of it.
But then I though about what it would mean to run from the authorities, to find some place to hide, how slight was the chance of actually succeeding... and ultimately I decided it wasn't worth the hassle for merely $100k.
Still, that was one wild monday morning, and it made me understand why some people succumb to temptation and run away with a couple million.

There are some buildings that will probably last 200 years or more, but there are also plenty of buildings that won't last 100 years, and some cheap stuff is already showing signs of going down the gutter after only 10 years.

UASF/BIP148 is essentially a network split, so depending on who those SegWit-but-not-BIP148 nodes connect to, they may see both kinds of blocks, or only SegWit-signalling/SegWit ones.
If they only see SegWit blocks, they will be automatically on the SegWit chain. If they see both kinds of blocks, it will depend on which chain gets more hash power.
They only need to change their node to UASF/BIP148 if they want to enforce the network split, or if they want to make 100% sure they follow the SegWit chain no matter what.

Not exactly.
Your SIM card has an [ICCID]( and an [IMSSI]( which identifies it on the network, and your operator maps that to your phone number. It's up to the operator and/or applicable legislation to decide what they require to change that mapping onto another SIM card with a different ICCID and IMSSI.
Given that cell phones are increasingly being used for verification and 2FA, they "should" require a physically signed form... and they "should" make sure that it is you who signed it... but you really have to check your applicable legislation and make sure your operator is following it, because ultimately all it takes is a change in their database. And even if they were supposed to verify everything properly, sometimes people skip some steps they see as "excessive", and some people are good at convincing them to do so (aka: social engineering).
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:40:00

Starting on "01 Aug 2017", BIP148 compliant nodes will drop blocks from miners who don't signal SegWit support, and miners have nothing to say about that.
Whether that will be enough to pressure miners into signalling SegWit so it can activate on or before "15 Nov 2017", or if they will be able to circumvent the network of BIP148 enabled nodes well enough to stay competitive... well, that remains to be seen.
Also if that fails, UASF might be implemented as a hard set SegWit activation date for 2018.

But that's not just "a shitload" of hash power, that's many many shitloads of hash power. As in, the going rate for NiceHash is "as low as $1/GHs", while the current Bitcoin hashrate is over 5,500,000 THs, so if he were to spend like $5,500,000,000... then maybe.

It is partially correct, as it doesn't take into account the effects of the Bitcoin network.
If enough network nodes (miners or not) switch to BIP148, they will effectively create a sub-network where all miners will mine a single longest SegWit chain.
If miners keep exchanging blocks among themselves, and particularly with miners who are actively trying to stop SegWit, then what that comment says is what may happen.
In any case, if more than 50% of the hash rate mines SegWit, be it because they actively support it, or because they connect through the split BIP148 network and that's all they see, then that will be the longest chain and that's it.
BTW, current SegWit support+readiness is [about 85%](

You could use any existing system to associate any pair of pieces of information. Like, publish it on a website, send it through skype, sign it with your PGP key, include it in a Namecoin address, even add it to a TXT field in your domain.
However, none of those methods are foolproof, and ultimately any of them can be subverted by a scammer, so you just have to always be alert and triple-check everything when you're moving any amount of money that you don't want to lose.

Once SegWit fails to activate on the non-UASF chain, you will be the ones losing your shirts and food money. Have fun.

Depends on whether they bought them and when, or if they mined them, when, where and with what.

I think the solar part is interesting if you have actual greenhouses producing actual produce in them, as it could act as an exit plan if the mining operation tanks. Once you break even, if that's possible, then you'd still get to keep the solar panels for another 15 years no matter what.

Precisely, they'd probably need to get some mercenaries and overthrow that government. Nowadays banks and governments are so intertwined that there is no "government giving banks the power to be the problem", it's essentially banks giving the power to themselves.
Banks *are* the problem as much as the government, and the only way to fix that is to introduce someone else in the equation: the people.

Any miner with SegWit support and connected to BIP148 nodes will see everyone else signal for SegWit and will start mining SegWit too.

Laugh all you want. Starting on August 1 all your non-SegWit-signalling blocks will get dropped off the BIP148 network, no matter how many nodes are there on it, no matter how much hash rate is there on it, and there is nothing you can do to change that.

I don't have first-hand experience with them, but Verizon seems to allow [activating a SIM card over the phone](
You'd probably have to get a Verizon SIM card, then call them complaining that it isn't working and ask them to "just fix it". Maybe add a crying baby to the background, your husband shouting at you, etc. to distract them and so they try to bend the rules to help you, or so they just get distracted and forget about some of the procedures. If you find someone gullible enough, and you probably will if you do it right, you might manage to reset the account's PIN with just publicly available data, then on another call they might end up asking you for your card's ICCID so they can fix any "mistakes" in the database... and after thanking them for "just fixing it", you'd have your cloned phone.

Nobody cares about miners signalling or not BIP148. All miners have to do is to signal SegWit to be part of the BIP148 network, or not signal SegWit to get excluded.
Even if they were a minority, which they are not ([87% SegWit support]( the supposed remaining majority would still have to perform a 50% attack on the minority chain to pose any risk to it, which would severely cut into their profits. Not even ETH/ETC has seen that, even though they're at 13:1 hash rate.

The interesting point about a hardware wallet is that it's much simpler than a smartphone, which means it exposes a much lower attack surface and can potentially be fully audited.

It doesn't, but once activated it will still need some miners to function.

The use of gold in electronics would definitely increase if its price were to fall. Right now about 10% of gold production gets used in electronics/industry, and it's limited to parts that "really need it" because of the increased costs. It could easily be used several times more to protect all parts, not just the most vulnerable ones.

Not sure how would you argue that last "both won't" part. Whether it's bigger blocks, or a few giant lightning hubs, both would have a centralizing effect. The only difference is that centralized Lightning hubs don't prevent and can get replaced by smaller hubs, while big blocks are just always centralizing.

BIP148 doesn't create a fork, it only enables the SegWit fork, which has been more than tested.

Except they are not. Support is being able to process SegWit blocks. Signalling is setting the corresponding version bit in non-SegWit blocks. If you know about the DDoS attacks that have been going on, you may also know about miners messing with their signalling so they don't become a target. On August 1st we'll see who's really who.

Please use a dictionary to look up any words you have trouble with.

SegWit includes the malleability fix which [enables Lighning network]( If SegWit activates after Aug 1, in 6-9 month the good people of Litecoin will surely already have a nice Lightning GUI which we'll be able to copy. If SegWit does not activate on Bitcoin though, it will be just as easy to jump over to Litecoin.

What does that mean? Is those some similarly like thing with them?
@_date: 2017-06-01 23:34:51


What kind of nonsense is that? If a miner doesn't follow BIP148 and they don't see SW activation, they won't mine any SW blocks. If they do follow BIP148 and/or see SW activation, of course they should mine SW on top of non-SW, that's how SW activation works.
They still don't need to signal BIP148 in either case, signaling is totally irrelevant to BIP148 activation. Only SW signaling is relevant to SW activation, and BIP148 will stop any blocks not signalling SW from propagating, effectively making miners connected only through BIP148 nodes to see a 100% consensus for SW activation.
