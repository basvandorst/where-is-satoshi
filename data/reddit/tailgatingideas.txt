GXS, if you are wanting to dump your BTCs so badly, why not spend them in my online store? I recently started taking BTC as an alternative to PayPal. [Tailgating Gear Store]( It's an online store for tailgating gear and partying supplies and has a lot of unique stuff. While you are trying to get out of BTC I am trying to get in and my online store is one way I can do it without hitting my personal savings account. Just a suggestion if you haven't finished your holiday shopping yet.

This reeks of trolling and putting up something controversial in order to see how many comments the original poster can get on Reddit. But I guess mission accomplished because here I am commenting and there are four others who have commented before me. Good job Jeffoxxy!

I think this one nailed it. If more and more people use BTC, the governments that can inflate currency by just printing money (See QE under the Obama Admin) will essentially be put out of business. Imagine a world where you could pay your mortgage or car payment using BTC or USD. Currency is as valuable as the users perceive it to be. The US was taken off the gold standard years ago but the people believed the paper in their wallets still had value. Same goes for BTC. The users believe it to have value to be exchanged for goods and services. Sadly it is a small group right now but those who believe it in it would like it to be universally adopted.
