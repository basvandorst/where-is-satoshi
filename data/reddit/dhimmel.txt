Thanks for the breakdown. In the past, I searched for the savings one could expect via SegWit and had trouble finding good estimates. I guess it's highly transaction dependent. In this case, the sender saved 54% by having used P2SH-P2WPKH rather than P2PKH addresses as inputs.
Excited for P2WPKH addresses to become standard. Do P2WPKH and P2SH-P2WPKH outputs consume the same amount of space (i.e. equal cost to send to)?

Since the title doesn't mention, it's block number 505,225.


I believe the transaction [`55668dfea4827ee0e48adedb808f338f710e21f2a476adcb2f9617980d54054e`]( is a good example.

It was interesting to see the video where the police ambush you and risk blowing your brains out. All because you sold a few bitcoins.
The whole video would help with donations -- just to illustrate the baselessness of the charges and the cruelty of the premeditated entrapment.

I once did the *paper-wallet-for-birthday-gift* technique. Great method for introducing users.
One great paper wallet feature would be an option to include a **new user information** section. If selection, the option would print on the lower page information to assist newcomers. Topics mentioned would include:
* Quick overview that intrigues
* Learning resources
* Basic Security: TFA, passwords, SSL, trustless services
* Localsearch providers like coinmap.org
* News Outlets: this reddit, LetsTalkBitcoin, coindesk
I worry that without this information, paper wallet recipients will stash their gift and forget about bitcoin.

I'm a bit confused. Let's take block 3. [bitcoinstrings.com shows]( shows several ascii drawings embedded into the transactions. However, [blockchain.info shows]( that this block contained no transactions besides the coinbase.
Also, when multiple transcations are needed to cover an entire string, how is order preserved? Does the site differentiate between transactions?

I'm not questioning whether Pascal's actions meet the legal definition of money laundering. Hopefully, the defense will show otherwise, since the ability to transact freely underpins a free society.
I'm questioning whether *pointing guns at Pascal's head, locking him in a cage, placing him under house detention, and forcing him to exhaust his life savings so he potentially doesn't get locked in a cage for the next 25 years* is a fair punishment for selling some bitcoins. Imagine next time you sell a car on craigslist, you are held at gunpoint and robbed of your prosperity/time simply because the fictitious buyer had fictitiously obtained fictitious money in a manner deemed *illegitimate*.

The capitalization of the [gold market]( is ~1600 times larger than the [bitcoin market](
So if bitcoins were valued similarly to gold, bitcoin mining would consume far more energy and produce far more carbon dioxides. This is intuitive since the main input to bitcoin mining is electricity.

Does anyone know how the ETF fund would have been different than coinbase.com? With coinbase you can buy and store custodial "coins" and exchange back to dollars down the road.
Personally, I'm glad that it's remaining true that there is little convenience benefit to custodial accounts versus private-key storage.

`bitcoin/bitcoin` currently has 6,927 [pull requests]( (183 open, 6744 closed). The ID that reached 10,000 combines pull request and issues. So  is not actually the 10 thousandth pull request. See for example  which increments the ID, but is an issue not a pull request.
Using GitHub's markdown shorthand, we would refer to the pull request and issue repsectively as `bitcoin/bitcoin and `bitcoin/bitcoin (or just ` and `

I'll answer. Bitcoins holdings in coinbase.com and the ETF are the same folly. Not yours. Custodial.
ETF would provide bitcoin exposure to the major/established markets of the world. But those aren't the markets I want to support.

 can you point me to an active proposal to fix transaction malleability via a soft fork? [BIP62 proposed]( a partial malleability fix as a soft fork but [was withdrawn](

I agree that with hardware wallet support, many hardware wallet users would run a full nodes for the added security.

From my understanding of the original post, it appears that Craig submitted to the court an email claiming to be from Dave to Uyen in 2012. However, the PGP Signature is dated from 2014. Apparently this is after Dave died. 
So does the PGP signature actually validate the email contents or not? It seems that if not, the email is fraudulent (unless there are some encoding/text complications). However, if the PGP signature does validate, then Craig got a hold of Dave's PGP private key after his death? Or possibly the email is real and the system time was misconfigured on Dave's machine?
In short, I'm curious about the PGP signature more generally and whether it attests that the content of the email was written by Dave?

I’m not able to download the original file at  to verify that it’s SHA-256 hash is `d3e7183ce9967880c1d73d46ddcadbfcb5c64ba92b3f9ae0d4ae5a910d1060d8`. I’m getting the following error in my browser: `DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN`. Did anyone actually download and verify this file?

The commit message doesn't even mention the block size limit:


Was there a reason to hide the change or did Satoshi just have poor version control etiquette?
@_date: 2017-04-26 21:31:57
Thanks  Your download link worked. I verified the SHA-256 hash and the [transaction]( in bitcoin block 443954, which was mined on 2016-12-18. I also uploaded `minerchatlog-sha256.txt` to [a gist](
In the past, [I've come across]( timestamps that didn't verify (likely due to incompetence not forgery). But anyways it's always important to verify things for yourself.

Those are good points, although my main interest is disproving this possibility beyond a reasonable chance of doubt, which would likely be the standard should he be charged with perjury for this matter.

You were able to download `minerchatlog-sha256.txt`? None of the raw links work for me, e.g.:

Can you upload the file somewhere like a GitHub gist?
@_date: 2019-04-17 01:26:37
I see. So Craig impersonates Dave by generating a PGP key that uses Dave's email. Does the MIT key server have history information for each public key, like when it was uploaded and which other identities vouch for its authenticity? Isn't there some infrastructure for determining whether a key actually belongs to certain identity? This approach should provide additional evidence that the PGP key did not belong to Dave.

 consider enabling GitHub Issues, so you can get discussion and suggestions around the codebase. In lieu of reviewing every commit myself, I'd be hesitant to run this software without seeing a healthy issues and PR ecosystem.
