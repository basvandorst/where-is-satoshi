Yeah. I'm well aware of that. I must be doing some black magic cause I've never have paid that much. 1A9ahKpu1u2aQ6pppCSKzdsZmQh8dThxpT &lt;-- Most recent BTC transaction of mine.

Why is it I can transfer from Gdax to Binance or something like that and only pay $5? (Sending 100)
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:13:52
I'm up to 1.5 hours on the verification screen on GDAX

@_date: 2017-12-09 21:50:34
I tried going thru Coinbase and it's stuck on the verification page too. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:08:08
Mount up.

How does one go about getting verified? I've been trying for the last week.
@_date: 2014-04-03 11:01:41
But it's Daft Punk

Full article? It was 4 short paragraphs.
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:58:34
I did buy some from Coinbase. They purchase hasn't been finalized. I couldn't do an instant buy with them because the only Visa card I have is a debit card and they don't take it.
I'm starting from complete scratch. These 1.25 coins I bought are my first.
I didn't feel like going through all of the verification process needed to add cash on other sites.
@_date: 2014-04-23 10:54:17
20K for a few weeks of being hassled?
I'll take it.

But did he run SR?
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:46:31

Move forward? Just a little over a week ago 400 million dollars disappeared. I don't see how that doesn't bother people. If 400 million in gold disappeared people would be freaking out selling what they had. Sure, some might buy because it would be cheap but still.
If the creator of Bitcoin were to suddenly cash out, you don't see that as a red flag?
@_date: 2014-05-21 10:51:51

So basically he's getting £5,000? Why mention Bitcoin at all?
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:35:14
I'm only buying to make money. There is nothing that I would buy with BTC. It makes no sense to me, nor do I have the need to send money to someone.
@_date: 2014-09-29 10:42:36
So much red :/
@_date: 2014-03-17 15:55:45
He isn't fooling me.
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:25:43

lol at the downvotes. Apparently people don't like truth
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:11:11

@_date: 2014-03-07 00:35:39
So that must make it true, huh?
@_date: 2014-03-18 18:46:13
So because the known coins Satoshi has haven't been touched, that means he doesn't own any others &amp; that means Dorian isn't Satoshi?
@_date: 2014-04-11 16:14:45
It's probably safe to say that considering your investment of over $140,000, it's most likely a very small fraction of your overall wealth. A drop in the bucket. 
That's why people are freaking out. They put hard earned money (and if they're stupid, more than they should've) into a pit that gains value but drops in value even quicker.
Bitcoin may be great and all, but nobody is going to want anything to do with it if its value keeps on dropping.
@_date: 2014-03-09 01:13:03
How much did you lose?
@_date: 2014-04-04 10:52:17

@_date: 2014-03-28 13:24:12
Yeah. We're going to start measuring currency in distances/heights. How high does 200 bitcoins reach? 
@_date: 2014-03-12 21:13:55
I wouldn't be buying anything with BTC. It's pointless to me.
@_date: 2014-03-28 22:21:29
Yeah, I don't see anywhere there being hundreds of millions worth of gold vanishing and nobody being held accountable for it.
@_date: 2014-04-23 14:26:56
Yeah.. I read somewhere that Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and other millionaires are always looking over their shoulders.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:50:42

He'll have to change it again tomorrow when the value decreases more :)
@_date: 2014-03-20 11:31:32
Is that why prices are falling?

@_date: 2014-03-14 18:47:08
Isn't that what a majority of supporters want, it to replace the dollar?

That's what makes him awesome.

if its even still around as hasnt crashed further

Why didn't he come out when others were accused?

What better way to hide than to act like a poor old man, &amp; get money donated to him all while his bitcoins stay put.

Why do they look like they want to fuck each other?
@_date: 2014-05-21 00:17:17
At least in 1 year from now the value of one dollar will be relatively close to what it is right now.

I've done a decent amount of LSD while looking at pictures of the Rocky Mountains while listening to Alice Cooper on 8 Track and have been able to conclude that Bitcoin value might change.

@_date: 2014-08-08 11:41:06
So, you're going to bug the same company once a day for a year? Or 365 different companies? Why don't you just spend your coin where they're already accepted?
@_date: 2014-03-14 17:07:11
And the fact that it's value fluctuates so much is the reason why it will never replace the dollar.
@_date: 2014-03-24 10:58:33
What's your store name so I know to avoid buying from you?
@_date: 2014-03-07 12:14:00
Because he doesn't want his credit being taken ;)
@_date: 2014-03-21 10:51:30
I still do.
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:02:54
So why is it bombing?
@_date: 2014-09-19 11:06:35
So are people still buying even though it's sinking?
@_date: 2014-03-21 11:03:46
At least I know 1 dollar is 1 dollar.
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:06:45
"Good for true btc believers"
I'll wait for that to be said when it's value is less than $100 in a few weeks.

So why are prices still falling?
@_date: 2014-03-13 11:00:08
Coping perfectly fine.
I don't care if Bitcoin succeeds or bombs. The second it gets close to my buying price I'm selling. No loss to me.
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:14:50

So much money you don't know what to do with it, huh?
@_date: 2014-09-19 16:08:55
Is he paying with Bitcoin? He might want to hurry up if he is.
@_date: 2014-08-04 10:59:44


@_date: 2014-03-07 01:25:18
Far from it.
@_date: 2014-09-19 11:08:11
Everytime I see its value I just cringe more &amp; more.
@_date: 2014-03-13 10:57:18
My point is, there isn't a site that I'd be purchasing something with bitcoin because I already have a CC on my account.
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:03:42
Cash out asap cuz we going down down down.
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:34:29
How'd you get them coins tho? Buying them with a CC?
@_date: 2014-03-14 15:53:17
Smart man.

And prices continue to fall :/
@_date: 2015-01-06 12:00:27
Ahh, so this is why the price is falling.
@_date: 2015-01-23 17:02:17
In photos they always look like they want each other.

@_date: 2015-01-15 12:20:11
Every morning I check I expect it to be lower than the previous day.
Set expectations low, never disappointed.

@_date: 2014-03-28 15:57:08
What is contradicting? I don't recall a time when 500 million in gold disappeared.  Its also hilarious how people know Marky Mark is to blame and he's still free.
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:35:44
He lost ~300K by leaving coins on a exchange that has had trouble in the past and showed no signs of changing. Is that not stupidity?
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:55:46
I thought addresses were anonymous :oblivious:
@_date: 2014-03-22 17:39:00
Doubt it.
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:18:56
Did I say it was supposed to be? At least if he were to cash out he would have hard cash that could be useful.
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:15:59
Send him Litecoin?
@_date: 2014-05-26 15:53:15
Lemme prepare my shocked face
@_date: 2014-10-14 10:50:10
Shame. I was getting used to red.
@_date: 2014-03-30 13:52:01
Cash out ASAP. This shit is about to crash. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 16:11:14

How many millions more does Buffet have than you?
@_date: 2016-06-13 13:20:30
I've been holding for almost two and a half years now.
@_date: 2016-06-17 15:16:02
I know it's pure speculation, but is it possible to top that price? Even with it halving?
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:16:31
Send em to me?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:08:05
I thought about buying it at 8k last week. To think, by the time the funds got transferred and I had the 1 coin I could have already "made" nearly 3 grand.
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:25:26
Do you raise/lower the BTC value based on the Euro or do keep it set?
@_date: 2015-02-05 12:00:55


@_date: 2015-02-20 20:33:03


The horror!
@_date: 2015-02-20 20:47:50
Ive been waiting months for its value to rise just so I can sell it and make money off of it.
@_date: 2015-02-20 12:26:49


How could you not care?
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:56:23
Trolling? Not even. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:11:46


I "knew" of it when it was ~$9. Had no idea what it actually was, just that you used it to buy shit on SR.
@_date: 2015-02-05 11:56:17


Nope. Some other kid is just going to make SR3 and will end up like 1 &amp; 2.
@_date: 2015-02-20 12:04:22
That $1100 price tag was a fluke.
