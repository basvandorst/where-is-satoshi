In The Netherlands when people say Holland everyone knows they are talking about The Netherlands. The same as when people say I'm going to America, they know you are talking about the United States. 
And when people say Zuid-Holland (South-Holland) they mean the province Zuid-Holland (South-Holland) and not the south of The Netherlands. The same as when people say South America, they mean the southern continent and not the southern part of the United States.

From 
When selecting to revoke a certificate, you are required to select a revocation reason to put it simply are very confusing. Here is a quick guide to what those reasons mean so the next time you revoke a certificate, you can select the actual reason behind your request.
1. Affliation Change – The certificate’s information (organization name or location) is incorrect and may mislead end users to believing that they are dealing with a different organization.
2. Cessation of Operation – The owner of the certificate has ceased to operate.
3. Key Compromise – The certificate or private key password has been lost or stolen, the person responsible for the certificate has left your organization, or you believe an unauthorized person may have access to the certificate.
4. Superseded – You have generated a new key pair and CSR and intend to replace the certificate.
5. Privilege Withdrawn – The certificate is no longer active or needed.

Try to make clear that the purpose of mining to secure and verify transactions and the reward for doing that is new bitcoins.
I often see people just saying mining is the process of creating bitcoins and to do that you must solve hard puzzles. This is the worst explanation and I keep seeing it over and over again.

I'm guessing either btc-e screwed up with their certificates or godaddy revoked it. If godaddy revoked it btc-e will probably just get a new certificate from a different provider. This is seperate from hosting, their site is still up and running, just with an invalid certificate, so its not as bad as it looks but I wouldn't trade there regardless.

Having more than 50% of the mining power is not enough, you need economic consensus which basically means everyone must agree with the change.
This means:
- Miners
- Exchanges
- Wallets
- Merchants
- Everyone else using bitcoin
Lets see what I think is likely to happen in next in your hypothetical situation:
Exchanges don't agree with the change, so they keep running their original bitcoin nodes effectively splitting the network, now you have Bitcoin and Moreblockrewardcoin. Moreblockrewardcoin now has most of the hashing power but since nobody uses it it quickly loses value. The miners realize they have made a huge mistake, apologize to the community for starting drama and return to mining the same bitcoin that everyone else is still using.
This does not mean it cannot happen, it just means they need majority consensus, not just majority of hashing power.
@_date: 2015-08-23 12:25:41
You don't know what the economic consensus will be.

As some have pointed out 21 million may have been chosen because of technical/programming reasons but what is more important to understand is that when bitcoin was created it did not matter what the limit was. What actually mattered is that there IS a limit (as opposed to no limit) and that there is a RATE at which new bitcoins are created.
Satoshi made it so the rate would be that half of the remaining bitcoins are created every four years. He could have made the limit 21 thousand or 42 million but as long as the rate is still that half of the remaining bitcoins are created every four years the end result is the same.
If you bought 1 bitcoin today you would have spent around $290.
Imagine if Satoshi had chosen 21 billion as the limit, then $290 would have bought you 1000 bitcoins today.
So the question you are actually asking is why are half of the remaining bitcoins created every 4 years?
The answer to that I'm not sure about but I think it was modeled to behave like gold, becoming more scarse over time.

I tried the same as you on a Mac with Chrome and then recovered the key using these steps:
1) In Chrome go to Window -&gt; Task Manager and get the Process ID of the bitaddress tab.
2) In Terminal type: lldb --attach-pid *Enter-Process-ID-here* (example: lldb --attach-pid 1508)
3) Then type: process save-core /tmp/corefile
4) Then Chrome sometimes says tab is unresponsive, and you can choose Kill or Wait, choose **Wait**.
5) After a minute or so its finished, then type: exit (and confirm with Y)
6) Type: strings - /tmp/corefile &gt; ~/strings.txt
7) Type: grep -E '5[KJH][123456789abcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ]{49}' --only-matching ~/strings.txt | sort -u
8) You get a list of possible keys (I got 121), one of them was the correct one, I hope it works for you too.

So, I'll explain for everyone else:
In this riddle I made it possible to have a "fork" in the chests, depending on which dates you enter you get different key parts.
There are several dates about that bitcoin pizza, but the one that leads to the correct private key was: may 22
I assumed most if not everyone would get the wrong date from bitcoin wiki, which also leads to a different holiday in the next chest.
The next hints relating to this would have been:
* You may have created a fork on the 5th.
* Check out this 10000 BTC transaction:
@_date: 2013-05-17 00:16:09
Only first one is a capital, the one in the upper left corner.
@_date: 2013-05-19 21:15:34

yes, another hint will be added in the next 30 minutes

@_date: 2013-04-30 15:16:27
Haha, yes it seems in general many Bitcoin enthusiasts have this idea of Bitcoin vs government, but I think it does not have to be this way. Do you have a better solution? How would you prevent other countries from attacking the system? (North Korea anyone?)
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:02:32
Yep. So just to make it a bit more clear:
The answer to the 4th bin, which is the password for the 5th bin is the "I" in the 5th bin.
@_date: 2013-05-19 22:16:46
Congratz, nice you didn't even need all the hints. Please tell us how you figured it out :)
@_date: 2013-05-12 20:18:28
Nope, for this one a bin can have 1, 2 or 0 hints.
@_date: 2013-05-19 20:40:47
The 4th hint will be for chest 
@_date: 2013-05-17 01:46:01

You put 1 zero too many, its a very small amount but I'll transfer it back.

I think for the next riddles I will have it start with 1 hint, and then automatically add hints after 10, 20, 30, 60 etc minutes so the riddle will never take longer then maybe 2 hours (not sure about the time yet). I don't want people to get too frustrated with these riddles.
@_date: 2013-05-12 18:03:46
You use the answer as the password for the first cryptobin (3rd clue):  
@_date: 2013-05-08 21:49:29
Yep, it's astronomy. Actually it's 1 book, the left (white) page with the drawing you can see here:  and the right (dark) page is comet Halley. 1705 refers to the year in which Edmond Halley made a prediction about that comet.

@_date: 2013-05-12 20:24:55
Okay, just to help everyone out a little bit:
1) Answer this riddle to gain entrance - 1st bin
2) Beneath the guardian - 2nd bin
3) You can count the treasures on 1 hand - 3rd bin
4) Atomic number - 4th bin
5) It is pure - 6th bin
6) Too much is not healthy - 7th bin

Ok, I'll give something away, the thing you are looking at is the impact crater that is supposed to have wiped out the dinosaurs. This was supposed to be a hint for the first clue which are the coordinates to a crater on Mars.

Is this true?
GPU mining has made CPU mining useless, same with FPGA, and now it will also happen with ASIC mining. Do you know what the next step will be? What if the attackers build it first? Will it still be enough if the only ones supporting the system are techies?

@_date: 2013-05-17 00:05:41
I'm not sure if I understand what you mean. The hints are ordered, so you would not have to use a hint that came later before an earlier one.
@_date: 2013-05-07 21:14:27
See 
@_date: 2013-05-17 02:10:29
That's unfortunate, congrats to you as well, nice job both of you.
@_date: 2013-05-04 21:06:55
Looks like someone figured it out, 1 BTC has been transferred out.
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:20:01
Tip: 
1) Send a large amount of your coins to one of your receiving addresses
2) Print the private key of that address on paper, cut it in half and keep one half in your physical wallet and the other half somewhere in your house.
This way you will always be able to recover a large part of your coins.
@_date: 2013-05-16 21:15:32
It's up! Good luck everyone :)
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:35:01
yes, do not compare this to a paper wallet or cold storage, it's a simple recovery method for the scenarios described by the OP.
@_date: 2013-05-19 22:26:40
This is what everyone did, but where did you get the date for chest 
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:03:58
until you notice the private key has been replaced with [this](
@_date: 2013-05-19 23:02:32
**Full solution**
* Chest  the smallest Bitcoin unit today: SATOSHI
* Chest  PI DAY
* Chest  if you look closely on the right side of the page you'll see: RED EYES 
CREEPY EYES or SCARY EYES would have worked also.
* Chest  to this date still unsolved by cryptographers: VOYNICH MANUSCRIPT
* Chest  the date the first Bitcoin purchase was made: MAY 22
If you don't check your sources you would enter MAY 21 or MAY 18, both giving a different key part
* Chest  2 months later is: PI APPROXIMATION DAY
If you got chest  wrong then you would get MANDELA DAY, LIBERATION DAY or NATIONAL DAY and they do not give the right key part
* Chest  on March 12th 2013 there was a split in the blockchain also know as a: FORK 
@_date: 2013-05-16 22:38:28
That's odd, anyone else have this problem? I don't have bitcoin-qt anymore.
@_date: 2013-05-08 21:15:22
Congratulations! Tell us how you figured it out :)
@_date: 2013-05-09 20:03:10
The new riddle is posted, the price reward has been doubled, good luck everyone!
Oh and by the way, new hints will be added every 30 minutes

ooh I like this idea. It's technically a bit more challenging but I'll work on it
@_date: 2013-05-19 20:46:56
keep it simple / short

Wow, that was fast! I guess I have to make them a bit harder. Thanks for donating!
Please post how you figured it out :)
@_date: 2013-05-11 01:54:53
It's not mentioned on the site yet but hints will be posted every 30 minutes, good luck!
@_date: 2013-05-17 01:35:14
that is the correct order
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:20:37
Did anyone unlock the 6th cryptobin (starting with nQEhlp) yet? I wonder if I made it too hard
@_date: 2013-05-17 02:31:05
I don't have logs in this detail but I will look into this, what browser are you using?
Did anyone else experience this also?
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:30:42
Congratulations :)
@_date: 2013-05-11 09:08:45
Congrats! :)
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:46:06
That's not a problem if you encrypt your wallet... or if you are talking about the physical wallet, not a problem either, the jackass doesn't have the other half of the key and you can just print the private key again from your computer.
@_date: 2013-05-19 19:53:17
Good luck everyone! I think this one might be a bit easier than usual, we'll see.
@_date: 2013-05-16 21:43:12
No the clue changed from "Coordinates are in me" to "Coordinates are within me".
Knowing that this matters is another hint by itself, take it as a bonus.
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:45:00
Try reloading the page and just enter the private key only, let brainwallet fill in the rest (no need to enter the source address)
@_date: 2013-05-17 00:16:14
Only first one is a capital, the one in the upper left corner.
@_date: 2013-05-10 16:13:24
Congratulations ymgve and smeggletoot! 
ymgve, as the first, please tell us how you figured it out :)
@_date: 2013-04-30 15:30:17
I'm trying to imagine Bitcoin as the money of the future, there will not be non-users, bitcoin will have replaced current money, just like current money has replaced rocks or whatever people used before money.
@_date: 2013-05-12 19:29:32
@_date: 2013-05-12 18:57:47
If you are not sure about capitalization:
Answers are written like Wikipedia titles, for example:
    "Bitcoin" and not "bitcoin"
    "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and not "Raiders Of The Lost Ark"
    "General relativity" and not "General Relativity"
So if you are not sure, look it up on Wikipedia.
@_date: 2013-05-17 00:29:50
**Which hints belongs to what?**
Hint 1 belongs to chest 1
Hint 2 belongs to chest 2
Hint 3 belongs to chest 3
Hint 4 belongs to chest 4
Hint 5 belongs to chest 4
Hint 6 belongs to chest 5
Hint 7 belongs to what was in chest 5
Hint 8 belongs to what was in chest 5
Hint 9 belongs to what was in chest 6
Hint 10 belongs to what was in chest 6
Hint 11 ... well...
@_date: 2013-05-05 11:50:40
These challenges are a great idea, I had fun participating, I hope you continue doing them!
At some point you will probably run out of BTC for this and if the donations are not enough maybe it is an idea to set up a mini website for this where people can participate in the challenge for 0.02 BTC (or some other small amount), and maybe buy hints for 0.01 BTC and then use all these bitcoins for the next challenge.
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:08:35
no no, the "I" refers to the word used to decrypt the 5th bin.
@_date: 2013-05-12 20:40:21
cryptobin, it's a list of which hint belongs to which cryptobin.
@_date: 2013-05-12 20:04:10
The hints for this one are placed in the same order as the cryptobins.
I might post some free hints here for earlier cryptobins later.
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:57:23
This is interesting, thanks for the link!
@_date: 2013-05-09 23:23:22
so close :)
@_date: 2013-12-29 04:28:17
Here's my [entry]( :)
@_date: 2013-05-19 20:57:41
Yep, you are not finished ;)
@_date: 2013-05-17 02:21:31
Zoom in and then put it in satelite mode :)
@_date: 2013-05-12 21:05:17
I will post a hint in the comments in a few minutes.
@_date: 2013-05-25 23:43:03
Not that this mattered for solving but in the last chest there was a typo, this was not intentional or some hidden clue, I have fixed this: anwered -&gt; answered
@_date: 2013-05-17 00:09:31
Send me the key in a private message, I'll check if you did it right
@_date: 2013-05-06 19:45:11
Yes like buge said, I give a new unique address to each visitor. 
But hints are free at the moment so you do not need to worry about that for now.
@_date: 2013-05-12 21:04:38
For those stuck on the 3rd bin:
One element is missing.
@_date: 2013-05-17 00:17:41
Yes they are in the same order, its just that some chests may have 0 hints and others can have more.
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:48:32
[The best part](
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:52:08
Yes, hint numbers are not in direct relation to chest numbers, I can see how that can be confusing, I will change that for the next riddle.
@_date: 2013-11-05 19:13:27
I did not expect this so soon but this is amazing. I just ordered my first meal with Bitcoin! 
Finally we are getting to the point (at least in the Netherlands) where Bitcoin can be used for more than just savings.
Important detail: Regular payment has a 1 euro transaction fee, with Bitcoin its 0.

I have now added the ability to get notified when a new riddle is posted:
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:47:02
It has 2 words and someone already mentioned the first one.
@_date: 2013-05-07 18:32:23
I made a mistake pasting the same thing twice somewhere, which made it impossible to solve this, I have fixed this now, please try the same steps as you did before, from the start.
**I apologize if screwed someone with this, I'm really sorry!!**
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:12:03
Not a hint :)
@_date: 2013-05-25 23:36:16
So far you are the only one who has unlocked everything, with all the info you have you should be able to deduct how many key parts there are.
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:02:37
It is solvable without the hint.
@_date: 2013-05-08 21:23:45
Good suggestion, I will add that!
@_date: 2013-05-07 20:54:01
Congratulations!! And yeah don't forget to transfer, you posted the key before I saw the coins being moved, I hope you were the one who took it.
@_date: 2013-05-17 00:12:03
I guess that might be a bit hard to see, it was not an intented part of the riddle, I will post which are capitals and which are not soon.

Not necessarily
@_date: 2013-05-26 11:40:12
If you can't or are unable to run a bitcoin daemon you can also use the API on blockchain.info: 
They have some example code in PHP and Java.
@_date: 2013-05-19 20:58:43
For those who have unlocked all chests and noticed the combined key does not work: yep, you are not finished ;)
@_date: 2013-05-19 21:39:15
Not deliberate, just typo's, I'll fix it
@_date: 2013-05-19 23:46:35
I noticed in the stats someone unlocking the right chests, but the coins didn't move, I guess that was you, better luck next time :)
@_date: 2013-05-07 17:50:40
Sure! It's getting harder and harder to think them up, any help is great!
@_date: 2013-06-02 20:03:05
It up! Good luck everyone!
@_date: 2013-05-16 21:35:29
Oops, I made a small mistake on the 4th chest, please refresh and try again, 1 word has changed! Sorry for this!!
