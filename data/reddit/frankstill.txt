If it was purposefully cringe I would agree but i think the guy who made this was being serious.

This is cringey AF.

Its not male, its IDENTIFIES as male, so could be SJW's playing their gender games.

please can someone post a Mirror. Some countries can't view this video and we are all very interested in this news.

This post has a lot of references to law which makes the claim that Nick Szabo is, or is one of the people behind, Satoshi stronger.
The licencing sentence is very much from the perspective of someone familiar with law as is the use of the word predicate, which is used in law.

This is why NEO, GAS and WTC are all great investments now. Once people realise that the government just wants in and is not destroying the market this coins will fly!

**Occasional British English spelling and terminology (such as the phrase "bloody hard") in both source code comments and forum postings led to speculation that Nakamoto, or at least one individual in the consortium claiming to be him, was of Commonwealth origin.[4][6][21] Moreover, the first bitcoin block that could only be mined by Satoshi contains the encoded text The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks which implies that he was reading the London's The Times newspaper at the time of the inception of bitcoin.[22][23]:18
Stefan Thomas, a Swiss coder and active community member, graphed the time stamps for each of Nakamoto's bitcoin forum posts (more than 500); the resulting chart showed a steep decline to almost no posts between the hours of 5 a.m. and 11 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time. (Between 2pm and 8pm Japanese time, an unusual sleep pattern for someone presumably living in Japan) As this pattern held true even on Saturdays and Sundays, it suggested that Nakamoto was asleep at this time.[4]
Nakamoto's initial email to Dai is dated 22 August 2008; the metadata for this PDF (pdftk bitcoin.pdf dump_data) yields as the CreationDate the value 20081003134958-07'00' – this implies 3 October 2008 or a bit over a month later, which is consistent with the local date mentioned in the Cypherpunk mailing list email. This is an earlier draft than the final draft on bitcoin.org, which is dated 20090324113315-06'00' or 24 March 2009; the timezone differs: −7 vs −6.[24]
Gavin Andresen has said of Nakamoto's code: "He was a brilliant coder, but it was quirky".[25]**
So taken from the wikipedia article we can see that he used a lot of british terminology. Also not noted above, he used the word Favour not favor which is british spelling. How can we explain this? unless it was deliberate? 
Another thing that interests me is the time zones. so the timezones of the pdf for bitcoin was consistent for California which is where Nick is from but the time of posts on the forums is more consistent with central USA if he went to sleep around 11pm. if he went to sleep earlier it lines up with California again.

sorry to throw all this info on you at once but here is a nice list of early emails by Nick. a lot of them are about digitial cash or functions that could be used to create digital money. Which is not surprising considering his bitgold article. Maybe we can find something interesting in these.
@_date: 2018-04-06 07:32:41
great! looking forward to your reply. I have some other info which may be useful. Old stuff from usenet where people personally attacked Nick Szabo and others who gave away info of where he lived which may be a reason for his secrecy of his identity?
@_date: 2018-04-05 20:27:51
Thank you for this well thought out reply.
Have you seen this:
It is nick's take on Pseudonyms and how he has used them before and what to consider when making one. This adds to your theory that he would deliberately add red hearings for example the British English and newspaper article.
Something to consider very closely with this, which adds even more weight to SN being Nick, is that he discusses in this post not having much contact with your Pseudonym e.g. mail to and from your real identity. This could explain why Bitgold was deliberately left out of the bitcoin whitepaper. Bitgold was by far the closest thing to bitcoin at the time and you would surely think that SN would reference it as some ideas where directly lifted from SN blog posts. This for me is very strong evidence.
I know the coding of bitcoin was not traditional. Maybe SN was partly self-taught? For me the biggest barrier to believe Nick was SN is the coding. The coding was genius if unconventional. A lot of the small details in Bitcoin are only noticeable for their genius once you go through the code. I also seem to remember SN trying to explain a principle and was having difficulty to do it in words but had no difficulty in coding. I will see if I can find this post again. As we know Nick has a law background and he is very fluent in explaining hard concepts in English.
You are correct though, if they are separate people they are both geniuses. Both have had world changing ideas.
It would be interesting to find out where Nick was during this time and what his job was. I think that would add a lot of support or to the Theory if it matches up with what we know about SN.

I have also been extremely interested in finding out who Satoshi is/was as I love internet history. My big reservations for Nick are 1) could he program the original bitcoin. 2) once a lot of very clever people think it is you and you have a very heavy online presence it should have been easy to link Satoshi with Nick. I would love to actually discuss more about this with you if you have time as I am very late to this thread.

Hi man, 
Thanks a lot for another detailed reply. I appreciate the discussion. I have done my research on Hal as well and knew about his RPOW (also spent sometime on this site (archived of course) Very interesting stuff. As you know Bitcoin would not have been viable without his work and it seems Hal and Szabo's friendship grew stronger through time. To the point that Nick makes twitter posts about missing his friend Hal on the anniversary of Hal's birthday. 
The one thing I would love for you too look into during your research, as it is still the biggest issue that I have with Szabo being Satoshi, is the programming and the lack of programming that 
 can be attributed to Szabo. If we can find anything he has programmed that would be amazing. The problem is he could have programmed a lot of things but under other Pseudonyms. We can see through old emails and posts he valued his privacy (let alone a  huge part of Cryptography is based around anonymity) and if he is Satoshi, he would have a history of using them. This would therefore lead us to believe any other major programming project would also be done under a Pseudonym. Something also to think about. 
We also can't forget about the option that Sazbo was deeply involved with bitcoin and was solely responsible for all correspondence through the Satoshi name but may have had help with programming. MAybe by Hal?
 As we have seen by Nick's email on Pseudonyms he would not email to or from himself while using his Pseudonym. Since Satoshi never had contact with Nick publicly or privately(that has been released) this makes the case stronger that SN is Nick. How would we explain the very early emails between Hal and Satoshi if Hal was helping Nick? Nick would want to try and keep Hal's anonymity as well wouldn't he? or would it not be as important as all correspondence by satoshi, which could link satoshi to Nick, where done only by Nick and therefore there was a lot less chance of people suspecting Hal?
@_date: 2018-04-06 07:49:01
An email from Nick in 1995 providing evidence that he knew Hal for over a decade before bitcoin AND he may have worked on a digital currency with him before.

this is true! I know a few people who would like to get in but because of regulations and the high prices of localbitcoins they cant. How would I go about starting a small shop and starting to sell and buy bitcoin?
Would I just buy a bunch of bitcoin myself on an exchange overseas and then sell it in my country for a premium? lots of people would buy bitcoin as it would be an easy way to launder stolen money (lots of stolen goods where i stay hence third world)... but then I would need a large balance of bitcoin... 
also is this not risky due to the nature of bitcoin increasing and decreasing in value by so much?
which ever way I do this I will need to be liquid.

They dropped all charges relating to the hiring of a hitman. It was obviously a lot easier to convict him on the whole drug dealing thing but it may have also been because they made up the whole killing thing to enable them access to his private info. This is what eventually brought him down. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 09:42:15
thanks a lot for all the advice. It would be a great idea I think. 
I just need to figure out a way to buy bitcoin at a cheaper price overseas. A lot of people from the neighbouring countries come here to buy stuff as they have nothing in there countries. They end up using US dollars a lot of the time which is not as easy to get cross borders as bitcoin. bitcoin would solve a lot of problems for them.

The tourist Idea is great! I just wonder how many tourists know about bitcoins let alone use them! 
Thanks for all the help man! There is definitely a business here somehow.
@_date: 2017-07-31 07:40:27
As someone who lives in a third world country. what would be the best way to get hold of bitcoin? localbitcoin is insanely expensive where I am from.
