I'm agreeing with you. NOW was too early to limit the blocksize. It's completely destroyed BTC's network effect.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:37:17
Some miners could choose to set a minimum, yes. Some miners could be generous, set a 0 fee and risk having their found block propagate slower and the chance of another being accepted higher.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:21:33
Sounds like you have it all figured out. My bad. Non-mining nodes are  the key to the whole system.

Decentralisation is a product of adoption. Allow the original use case to exist and adoption and decentralisation follow.

He's saying that the high fees are required for when the block reward goes near zero. He didn't link to any research. High fees few transactions is probably about the same as low fees many transactions IMO, except with the latter you have a usable currency. The miners get paid in both cases and if you can scale on-chain it may be that they get more fees in the end.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:58:10
Only mining nodes count. And miners can support high costs.

The only reason that people don't understand money is because learning about it wasn't in their education. It's a pretty easy concept. I took a look at Bitcoin in early 2014 and I knew jack shit about how money worked. Now I learn how it actually works, I realise that Bitcoin is inevitable. Most of my savings are in Bitcoin. You underestimate the number of people that sit on the political fence and are turned off learning about polotics just because they think there is no way to change the system. Now there's a way: to opt out. I didn't know anything about Ron Paul before looking into Bitcoin, now I respect him immensely. There are many that are libertarians but just don't know it yet. I was one.
This is the video that people should be pointed to: 
Although I must admit, James' video is great as well!

Goes to look up merge mining... 
Do you have back of envelope calculations that bring you to your 'fees probably won't be enough to secure the network' conclusion? If Bitcoin manages to scale such that it's processing VISA amounts of transactions, surely the global hash rate will equilibrate to 'high enough' such that an attack still isn't worthwhile.
EDIT: my learning stopped here:

There is room for precisely one when it comes to a store of value. Currencies will eat other currencies up for breakfast until a highlander emerges:  
Are you a hypocrite? You certainly look like one.
Using an alt coin to try and fund your project. Disgraceful. 
EDIT: Startcoin is significantly pre-mined and was pumped just like the rest to enrich the creators:

I think all those people criticizing Shapeshift.io for adding shitcoins don't really understand the genius of this site. The more ways to transfer value from a shitcoin to Bitcoin, the faster the shitcoin bubble will pop and the sooner it will die off. This is especially true when it comes to allowing people to pay into merchant's bitcoin accepting addresses with their shitcoin. There's a chance that the merchant keeps the bitcoin and the shitcoin is converted into bitcoin on whichever exchange Shapeshift uses. You should encourage them to add shitcoins not get mad about it.

I would like to add myself to the list of those concerned. I emailed Blockstream 10 days ago (no reply as yet) thinking about this independently without seeing any of the conversations in the OP or having any discussions with anyone about the economic incentives underlying this sidechains development:
"Long term problem?
I very much support the concept of sidechains because they strengthen the value proposition of Bitcoin, but isn't there a long term proble here? If people move their bitcoins off into sidechains because they are functionally better, and the Bitcoin block reward reduces to a point where it's majority fees supporting Bitcoin miners, won't there be a drop in security of the Bitcoin network because miners lose their incentives? If the fee structure in Bitcoin changes to a market structure and there is less and less demand for making transactions on the Bitcoin network, won't the prices for these transactions rise creating a positive feedback look which creates even less demand for the network and an exodus of bitcoins into the most popular secure sidechain?"
Proof: 
Ignore the second paragraph... I lose the plot a bit.
I got out a warm bed and grabbed my laptop at 5:36am from the lounge to post this (UK - I could have made tea in the same time it took to post this!). This issue is extremely important and must not be overlooked. If I can figure this out (I don't understand the Bitcoin protocol that well), it should be reasonably obvious to others that sidechains need careful consideration.

If a Bitcoin business with a banking interface wanted to use Kraken with as little friction on the fiat side as possible (fees into Kraken), would you be able to give them information/guidance on how best to do this? Maybe advice on how to get an account with Fidor, or if you have account with other banks possibly info about an account there so that the transfer costs are as low as possible into your exchange.

With such high and increasing fees, Bitcoin will never be used (sans 2nd layer protocols) in developing countries. This is not the Bitcoin I got behind in 2013.

7 pence isn't cheap for me. I live in the UK. Cat food is expensive. I can't be wasting extra money just buying it.

Choice is good, but forcing people to use these options by restricting block size seems just like banking to me!
@_date: 2016-02-21 21:18:15
Maybe another blockchain, yes. I sent a Bitcoin transaction yesterday. The 'normal' fee I needed to pay using my mycelium wallet was 7 pence (UK cents). This equates to more than one minute of air time in Rwanda. 
And for about 10 transactions, you can buy a beer in Rwanda.
Bitcoin will not be useful in Africa because of the blocksize limit issues and high transaction fees. Another crypto will be.
