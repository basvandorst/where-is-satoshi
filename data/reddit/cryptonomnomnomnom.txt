I prefer eating cold pizza the next day, so delivering it 12 hours late should be perfect.
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:29:15
Why do so many people who don't know what Bitcoin is, feel a need to be so negative towards it?
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:57:11
It's not that simple, because at least I understand some of the technology behind Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:28:44
Cold pizza is the best
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:33:06
Is there a collection of common nocoiner arguments and rebuttals? Would be a nice reference to have instead of random googling and reciting from my failing memory.
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:44:40
I agree ... I usually counter a few of their arguments, and ask them to seek out information themselves. This approach usually fails.
There should be a user friendly site with rebuttals of common nocoiner arguments.
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:24:06
I KNEW IT!
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:39:27
Is there something like this online?
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:03:15
Is there anywhere I can see how much USD value is transacted on Bitcoin per day?
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:25:17
Believing in Bitcoin, I do feel smarter, but in general I try to nudge people in the right way and tell them to seek out information.
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:53:52
You can send back and forth between segwit and non-segwit wallets without any problems.
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:47:25
Happy cake day!
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:56:54
I registered with my Facebook account, and they sent me a password in plain-text in an email - not too encouraging.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:01:53
Or there will be more pressure from Bitcoin users on businesses to adopt Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:07:14
Great analysis, do you have a paid Telegram group?
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:52:27
It's not bad
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:46:27
It's crazy
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:46:55
So you mean Bitcoin, then
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:30:53
Uh guys, what happened to the mempool?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:45:14
People, we need to talk. I know fiat is fun and all, but we need to get back to our roots - to hodl Bitcoin not because of gains, but because we're going to change the world.
Sure, you could erase your debt, but unless it's crippling debt, please don't! That means selling your precious Bitcoins to the people we're trying to undermine; the bankers.
Price is fun, but let's not forget the greater goal.
@_date: 2018-09-26 06:51:59


This is missing.


But this is not missing, the image shows what happens if a banana is changed and how the change propagates.
@_date: 2018-09-12 11:41:47
I see ~~dead people~~ red candles
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:23:06
What about cuecumber?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:09:17
Stop selling. Let's change the world together instead.
@_date: 2018-09-11 11:04:50
I'm so tired of the arguing between BTC and BCH, can't we all just get along? 
@_date: 2018-09-25 11:20:04
MtGox whale dumped coins: [
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:09:26
Left myself open for what?
What kind of transactions would I want to do with them? Do with who?
@_date: 2018-09-25 12:22:14
Aha, nice
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:06:21
Gemini not available in my country, Coinbase is... :(
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:22:58
I dunno man, at least my shorts are full of some kind of liquid
@_date: 2018-05-15 12:32:21
Bitcoin goes up, Bitcoin goes down, nobody can explain that!
@_date: 2018-08-14 10:50:54
Nice! Just in time for all the shorts to be liquidated.
@_date: 2018-05-15 12:35:04
Person  Have you heard the latest 50 cent album?
Person  75 cent album? No, is it any good?
Person  25 cent just released it, it's great.
Person  Cool, haven't heard anything by 1.24 dollars in ages.
*At ^least ^^I ^^^tried...*
@_date: 2018-05-15 12:30:09
Wife bought at 11-something last year, and was happy for a while, so Bitcoin is going to have to do better than that.
@_date: 2018-05-15 12:31:34
| 25k in 2 ~~months~~ weeks
FTFY, this is Bitcoin after all.
@_date: 2018-05-15 12:30:55
Can you put it in mine too?
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:38:24
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2018-05-18 06:51:21
Huge if correct.
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:28:45
At least it's more than 1Mb... AMARITE?!!!11!1one
@_date: 2017-03-31 08:53:06
Sounds pretty awesome, though.
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:44:53
I don't, and I do.
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:18:14
Send me your private key, and I'll fix it!
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:29:17
So we're living in the alternate reality instead of the real one?! I knew something was wrong!
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:18:33
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:15:12
Pepperidge Farm remembers.
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:27:43
It could go up. It could go down. I know that for sure.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:15:29
But do you have to catch them all, though?
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:48:37
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:20:56
My wife wants me to cash out. Personally I want to see how far the rabbit hole goes.
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:02:47
Why am I instantly worried when BCH is up a lot, and BTC is down just a little bit? It's illogical, isn't it? After all, BTC is up a whole lot since August 1st.
I guess what I need you guys to do is to pat me on my back and tell me everything is going to be alright.
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:18:04
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:45:34
No, I sold my BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:19:13
Today I could officially have been a millionaire, if I had listened to that guy that talked about Bitcoin some years ago.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:30:12
Does anyone know of any webshops in or shipping to the EU that has the required hardware?
@_date: 2018-06-26 08:11:47
This is great - real world problems that can be solved with Bitcoin. I love it! :)
*Edit:* With Lightning it would even be possible to pay employees as often and as fast as anyone would want to.
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:49:05
Get a bitpay card, and spend it on whatever you'd like.
@_date: 2018-06-22 07:43:57
There's no moon there, though.
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:22:46
No. Can you please break up with all your girlfriends?
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:32:55
Yeah, what's wrong with you?
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:02:12
I'll take it.
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:26:13
In Siberia maybe.
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:42:49
If pizza-guy hadn't used his Bitcoins to buy pizzas, where would we be today?
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:25:38
He's not your friend, pal.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:33:47
Y'all got any of that apple ICO presale?
@_date: 2017-04-28 17:05:19
Classic Dave.
@_date: 2017-04-13 20:24:58
What is this sorcery?!
@_date: 2017-04-16 15:45:18
Absolutely, if only to support wider adoption.
@_date: 2017-04-30 08:26:56
On- or off-chain pizza though? ��
@_date: 2017-04-11 20:38:54
What am I looking at here?
@_date: 2017-04-17 09:01:31
@_date: 2017-04-15 18:14:21
I would suggest hodling.
@_date: 2017-04-21 04:56:47
In Norway too, so I suspect it's more widespread than that.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:09:55
Bought the "dip" at $13k, so yeah...
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:07:18
They can acquire from anyone who's willing, I'm certainly not going to require my kids to show IDs. :)
I'm considering giving my kids Bitcoin, which is why I'm asking.
I suppose any wallet could work, not sure what I'm looking for. Maybe one that is less technical?
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:29:28
Happy cake day!
@_date: 2018-02-18 21:35:56
You forgot Lambo
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:38:10
Since opening a bank account has age limitations, but using Bitcoin does not; has anyone made a child-friendly Bitcoin wallet? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:27:26
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:52:09
Why do you ask?
@_date: 2017-09-10 18:00:36
Just the tip?
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:29:53
My gut says hodl.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:03:07
Permanent dip
@_date: 2017-10-19 09:04:04
Someone edit this to say "I've got an ICO here..."
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:03:02
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:57:21
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:17:46
Wow, okay...
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:28:27
Get outta here!
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:45:04
You're no fun.
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:36:41
You should!
@_date: 2018-07-04 09:51:25
With wider lanes that no one uses.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:30:09
Somewhere between here and 0
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:27:03
Most definitely no
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:34:49
Very close to 9000
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:34:23
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:53:43
I'm going to sell some to buy some stuff my family needs, sorry :(
@_date: 2017-05-08 21:26:13
Just hope it's not Florida man.
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:27:06
Let me sing you the song of my people
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:03:50
It's a meme on he was talking about Ether. 
*Edit:* I guess here we'd talk about expensive pizzas
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:53:43
Haha, clever! :)
@_date: 2017-05-08 21:26:58
@_date: 2017-05-11 07:40:26
It's yuuuuge
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:24:20
You could have afforded one.
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:23:53
How's your Lambo?
@_date: 2017-05-04 05:04:08
What is this sorcery...
@_date: 2017-05-12 08:11:41
Hah, clever! :)
@_date: 2017-05-09 08:56:57
Bitcoin rallies after Core developer shaves his beard!
@_date: 2017-05-12 08:16:03
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:17:53
I think we also have to stop thinking about the fee in dollar value. As the fiat value of BTC keeps rising, so does its influence, and ... well, value. Who cares how many *dollars* the fee is, when the dollar value is irrelevant?
@_date: 2017-05-08 21:25:46
Is that on- or off-chain?
@_date: 2017-05-01 13:27:30
If a key is lost, you switch out the matching padlock.
@_date: 2017-05-04 04:47:57
Hodl tit and forget about tit.
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:00:47
I guess it's the ultimate I've-got-way-too-much-money thing. But not sure any have really done it.
*Edit:* I stand corrected!
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:13:23
What has the world come to, when Bitcoin is considered "stable"?
@_date: 2017-06-09 05:47:08
Yes
