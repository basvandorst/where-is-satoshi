3-7% transfer fee is a bit much.  I'm willing to wait for confirmation with Dwolla.com.

When people do this, they're really fishing for people and/or information that supports their own beliefs.
When interacting with these people in real life, the best thing is to just shut up and walk away.

That's like saying someone's not that dumb when compared to the mentally challenged.  MtGox is a *financials site with millions in circulation*.  Would you tolerate any other bank or financials institution using md5sum?

I have auto-generated site specific e-mails (thanks to [SpamGourmet]( ), and they sent this message to my Mt. Gox e-mail account so I know for a fact that it was leaked.
To be honest I'm not hating on that person / persons right now, because it's the only way I've found out about the leak.  OTOH Mt. Gox has yet to contact me about a data breach.

Depends on the country and carrier.  These are the major US carriers:
* T-Mobile: phonenumber 
* Virgin Mobile: phonenumber 
* Cingular: phonenumber 
* Sprint: phonenumber
* Verizon: phonenumber
* Nextel: phonenumber

Briefly watched the video.
What evilpacket is demonstrating is not a security problem with bitcoin itself, but rather cross-site-scripting (XSS) exploit for MtGox.com specifically.
This is basic browser security.  If you notice in the demo video, the https is crossed out.  This means the data is still encrypted, but Chrome can't tell if the server is who they say they are.  Usually this means that the browser has been hijacked and is browsing another site pretending to be MtGox.  In other words, just like PayPal if you're not sure don't follow links.  Open up a new browser and go to MtGox.com or PayPal.com directly to send money.

It's kinda retarded that I have to find out this information from Reddit and not an official company blog or status update page.

No, it's a DNS that uses Bitcoin's protocol to remain distributed.

There is a very insightful [post]( from Slashdot on this incident.
Remember, Mt. Gox started as MTG OX = Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange.

In the future, use something like [SpamGourmet]( to keep track of where e-mails are being linked and shut down spam.
Or if you're with Gmail, you can [use the plus sign or the period to track]( where e-mails are coming from, e.g. mailto:username+mtgox  When you get e-mails sent to that address, you can either filter it, block it, or track who leaked it to the public.

SQL injection works because it misinterprets user input as commands.  For example if you run `select * from table where id="$id";`, an attacker can input `1234 OR 1=1` and see the entire table because `OR 1=1` is a tautology.
There are many ways to prevent this.  The easiest is to try to sanitize user input (like trim white space, scan for commands) but there are many drawbacks and it doesn't work consistently.
The better way is to use prepared statements or bind variables.  Overly simplified, you explicitly tell the database what is user input so it doesn't parse user input as commands.
bind variables example:
    select * from table where id=:id_num:
    // define :id_num: elsewhere
prepared statements example:
    query = statement("select * from table where id=?"); 
    query(1234);

That's because your account at a bank is FDIC insured up to $250k.
Bitcoin's decentralization works for and against it.

I didn't see the interview.  What gives you that impression that they are sleaze balls?

Honestly I'd prefer more proactive notification from Mt. Gox in the future, especially as a financials company.
Using php_crypt(), short salt, md5sum as the hash, no application servers, site design, all just screws amateurish for an exchange that has **$26 million** in 30 days trading action.

That's only current market depth you can get from MtGox's [api]( anyway.

Where in TX?  Austin's rates are regulated around $0.11 KWh, DFW is around $0.15 KWh.
Also with the drought and heat, I highly doubt electricity usage is lower this year than previous summers.

LOL of course they would crowd source their logo design rather than hire a proper designer.

I did that myself in Google Docs.  It's probably too much of a hassle and considering how many models of graphics cards there are per chipset just adds complexity.

In the US, any existing debts are wiped when the person dies. This is not always the case in other countries, and debt gets passed to family members. Imagine being held responsible for someone else's fuckups.
