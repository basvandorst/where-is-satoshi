I use Gemini and I think they are far superior than Coinbase.

For me they were easier to set up an account, and they have faster withdrawal times.

I have paid in bitcoin on many purchases, it has purchasing power, it is money.

I think this explains what you are saying 
“According to the mainstream economic definition of inflation, Bitcoin is deflationary because the purchasing power of Bitcoin increases over time. Currently, Bitcoin’s purchasing power is extremely volatile, although, this is expected to stabilize in the long-run. Since Bitcoin’s total supply is fixed, Bitcoin’s purchasing power will continue to grow slowly over time if demand continues to increase.”
