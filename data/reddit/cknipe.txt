IMHO this thread highlights a bigger barrier to bitcoin adoption than anything happening over at Gox.  The last thing people with money and power want is an army of armchair forensic accountants digging through their financial dealings.

Sure, but in this case what does placing blame get people who lost coin? 
 Ultimately you are responsible for where you invest your money.  The CEO running the business into the ground may not be your fault, but having someone to blame isn't going to protect your investment.

And that's the problem with your entire point of view.  For the overwhelming majority of people faced with all these reports of bitcoin scams the smartest choice is not to put money in bitcoin.

The challenge there is finding one you can trust with your money.

Forgive me if I'm getting outside my level of comfort with bitcoin concepts, but how can blockchain.info help you?  AFAIK they're not an online wallet service, and it seems like your "they don't have access to your money" comment confirms that.
If not online wallet, what sort of service would they be providing to facilitate access to your money without having to carry around your wallet?
@_date: 2012-11-01 15:55:45
That's actually a pretty good idea.

I believe the technical term for this is "risk pooling".  It's the basis of insurance.

I don't think you can really paint this as having any public interest component. He's doing this for no reason but to put money in his pocket. There's plenty of incentive to mine, the community does not need him to bring down transaction costs, even if you could call aiding bitcoin "public interest."

I'm sure giving away money would be good for reddit's popularity, but probably not so hot for the bottom line.

If you're going to set up a mining rig to make money why do you need account holders?
Why not just keep the mining profits for yourself?
Interest is generally used as a tool to incentivize deposits, because you have some sort of profit you can generate using the deposited funds.
If you don't have some profitable use for the deposited funds all you're doing is taking on cost and liability for what appears to be no good reason.
Am I missing something?

What you're describing here is not "moving to a bitcoin economy" it's speculating on bitcoin with all your money and leaving yourself no flexibility in your positions (because you have to cash out to eat).
If you're still looking to an external currency as your Unit of Account you're doing it wrong.
@_date: 2011-06-02 17:55:59
The fact that it's made of bits?
@_date: 2011-09-07 17:37:54
I'm sorry, maybe I didn't clearly articulate my point.  I'm not disputing that there exist things that are both good investments and good currencies.  
The statement I quoted, however, which implies that anything which is a good investment is also a good currency, is obviously false.  Just because something is a good store of value does not make it a good medium of exchange.
@_date: 2011-12-06 19:05:16
The problem is that you're talking to people who want an easy way to move around USD, and offering them an entirely different currency.  I understand that it's a pretty cool currency, with built-in mechanisms for online transactions and all that, but it's still a different currency.  It comes with the problems of exchange rate fluctuations, limited places to spend, and the small but real chance that it might just flat out become worthless.
That's why you're being downvoted.

The way I read it it sounded like he was making a general statement about investments and currencies, which he was then applying to bitcoin.
It sounds like that's how you read it, too, considering you went to gold in your rebuttal.

I believe people have discovered many many ways to do this, with or without bitcoin.

Well, that's just one obstacle.  The other obstacle would be dealing with the bitcoin exchange rate.  I get paid in USD.  My grocery store does business with their suppliers in USD.  What they charge me for a carton of milk in bitcoin would have to change with the BTC:USD exchange rate.  It's just easier for me to skip the whole bitcoin step and pay with what I've got.  Why pay conversion fees and risk getting screwed on the swings in value?
Now if bitcoin were to reach some sort of critical mass where they were exchangeable for a relatively predictable value of goods it would be a different story.  As of now they only seem to operate as a stand-in for their current value in USD or EUR.

No good.  Timestamps on email are fundamentally unreliable.  Postmarks, on the other hand, constitute legal verification in all sorts of situations.
@_date: 2011-09-07 18:44:21
Well, now we're talking about something entirely different, and honestly I don't feel I have the economic background to form a solid opinion.
What I do know is that USD (my fiat currency of choice) has a relatively stable value, in part BECAUSE of central bank intervention.  It loses value over time, but generally at a reasonably predictable rate.  Further that loss of value incentivizes me to invest the money in ways that help the economy grow.
Is a representative currency better?  Maybe?  It seems to work fairly well for the Swiss, but again, we're getting well outside my area of expertise.
One thing that I feel it's important to realize here, though, is that while bitcoin exists in fixed supply, but it is not backed by any commodity.  This makes it significantly different than a currency backed in gold, oil, or carrots.
@_date: 2011-09-07 17:11:40


No it doesn't.  That's why I pay for my groceries with oil futures.

How do you know how many bitcoin a loaf of bread is worth?  Or a month of hosting?  Or a cashmere sweater?
The main way you value a unit of currency is based on what you can buy with it.  USD is something you can buy with bitcoin that has a fairly stable and well understood value.
@_date: 2011-09-08 13:02:13
This is the point that I think is being completely missed by the author.  A currency is only good as what you can exchange it for.  Bitcoin, aside from being accepted almost nowhere, has no stable value in real world goods.  That's a big ugly problem for a currency to have.
I'm not convinced the bitcoin people can't or won't get to a point where they have a decent currency on their hands, but all this "OMG, WTF, why are you still using that terrible old USD?!" rants just tend to reinforce the image of a bunch of kids playing currency.

Fine.  Forget USD.
How much gold can I buy with 1 bitcoin?  Has it gotten any easier to price that loaf of bread now?
