Why would that be an issue unless you're using money for illegal activity? Nobody knew then who Satoshi is so I don't know how that would be problematic especially if it's a life or death situation. As for your other questions, there's peer-to-peer bitcoin trading in which you can liquidate your bitcoin for cash or whatever arrangement you made with the trader in-person. And if by "someone", you mean the Feds, any fiat transaction beyond physical exchange of cash is traceable. Bitcoins are easily liquidated via Coinbase in the US or other peer-to-peer brokerage sites.

Many credit cards give you 5% cash back just for using them. You either choose to receive a check or as credit to your card balance so you'll pay less every billing cycle. Maybe you don't live in the US that's why you're not familiar with it?
@_date: 2018-06-13 03:23:51
I think there is some ESL barrier going on. I don't pay in advance. I was explaining how if you're an entrepreneur, let's say you're a restaurant owner, and you have overhead costs: location rent, employees to pay (cook,cashier,server/wait staff), food, utensils, PoS computers/machines (point of sale, you accept credit cards, Bitcoin) etc., then you already calculated your item prices in your menu based on how much you spent to keep the business going AND how much you want in profit. You would have calculated the base profit the business will have, regardless of how your customers pay. They mark-up their baseline price so that they get profit even if the customer pays using a credit card that will usually charge them as a seller (merchant) 2% + more per transaction. So, then you, NOW as a ***customer,*** PAY for them because you either need them or want them. In my case, all my credit card transactions are a NEED, i.e., I have no choice but to pay for them and I don't have other ***cheaper*** options ***EXCEPT*** if I pay with a credit card which ***will make the original price even cheaper.*** So if my water bill last month was $40, and I pay with my credit card, I get a 5% discount, or $2 back. 
I just found the Caixa credit card classic in Portugal with no annual fees. The Amex Portugal site seems inaccessible to me at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:33:37
You're conflating banks with credit card companies. Not all credit card providers are banks. AmEx is not a bank. And I use my credit card to pay for the water bill, electricity, cable TV, internet provider. Example, my tv+cable bill is $99. Every time I pay that, I get $4.95 back free just for using a credit card. Why are you worried about "killing economies" when the merchants who accept credit cards very well know what business they're doing? You don't think that they didn't offset their overhead costs to the services/products they sell and pass them onto the consumers? Their billing expenses are already accounted for in that $99 amount. It's you the consumer who need to get your money back. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 01:19:26
You also think you have to pay an annual fee to maintain a credit card. That is not correct. All of my cards don't have an annual fee. Those that do are mostly geared towards frequent flyers, or charge cards which are not credit cards. 
I thought I made it clear that the gain for me is **free money** just for paying necessities that I would otherwise have to pay every month like water, grocery, cable, cellphone (including prepaid), electricity/utility bill.

Why bother? Because banks put a cap on how much you can debit in a day. Some banks will only let you encash $500 max, even lower for some developing countries. When attached to credit cards, you're not allowed to use above the credit limit they set for you. If you're a MERCHANT, you'd have to surrender 2.6% to Visa PER TRANSACTION with every item you sell PLUS another fixed charge on top of that. If you accept American Express, make that 3.5%. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE! If you're traveling and you don't have that good credit or just got locked out getting approved of a good card, you get another 1-1.5% FOREIGN transaction fee. Oh we're not done yet. Order now and incur another 0.13% charge called "assessment fee!" �� Sure merchants will just pass the markup onto consumers. Good thing you're one of those rich shoppers with 9 iPhones, 25 Bentleys and a golden toilet. Because those seemingly tiny fees don't add up at all! Too many more reasons but oh, I'll just use my Visa.

Business owners care, first world or otherwise. If you make $10,000 a month as a small business owner, you lose $300 to these POS payment networks. That $300 becomes $3600 in a year, $18,000 in 5.

It's long term capital gains tax. The 37k/51k/77k values are inclusive of whatever else you earned outside bitcoin realized profits you liquidated. But you can still bring down the declared income if you put them in a tax deferred 401k up to 18k for single people under 60. So if say you made 37k from your 9-5 job, plus liquidated 10k from btc, thats 47k minus 18k (placed inside a 401k) = IRS will only see 29k. Hopefully you live somewhere with no state tax, otherwise, 29k is around 4% tax, 2% for married joint in California.
