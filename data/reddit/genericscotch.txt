I get these all the time.  I just assumed they knew I was clinically depressed based on my search history

No there's a hefty fuckin' fee

How much of that accounts for goods and services (i.e. not people trading or investing in it)

There is the old story about the market craze in sardine trading when the sardines disappeared from their traditional waters in Monterey, California. The commodity traders bid them up and the price of a can of sardines soared. One day a buyer decided to treat himself to an expensive meal and actually opened a can and started eating. He immediately became ill and told the seller the sardines were no good. The seller said, “You don’t understand. These are not eating sardines, they are trading sardines.”‘
Like sardine traders, many financial-market participants are attracted to speculation, never bothering to taste the sardines they are trading. Speculation offers the prospect of instant gratification; why get rich slowly if you can get rich quickly?
Moreover, speculation involves going along with the crowd, not against it. There is comfort in consensus; those in the majority gain confidence from their very number. Today many financial-market participants, knowingly or unknowingly, have become speculators. They may not even realize that they are playing a “greater-fool game,” buying overvalued securities and expecting—hoping—to find someone, a greater fool, to buy from them at a still higher price.
There is great allure to treating stocks as pieces of paper that you trade. Viewing stocks this way requires neither rigorous analysis nor knowledge of the underlying businesses. Moreover, trading in and of itself can be exciting and, as long as the market is rising, lucrative. But essentially it is speculating, not investing.
You may find a buyer at a higher price—a greater fool—or you may not, in which case you yourself are the greater fool.

Pretty funny video but what is it proof of exactly?  If the bears are correct, it is going to near zero at some point regardless of how many 'mini-bubbles' happen first.  The question is, is this another mini-bubble?  Sure, it could shoot up to 100k but who is going to drive the price that high this time...the coin can't get any more media attention than it did on this recent run-up, there were news articles literally everywhere and people were discussing it in all kinds of random places where you basically never hear about investing - the gym, video games, twitch chat.  Pretty hard to top that kind of attention

Excellent comparison.  I remember the poker boom quite well - the amateur Chris Moneymaker won the world series and brought so much easy money in to the game you could literally play the top few hands and make absolute bank mindlessly.  Many got hella rich.
I agree crypto will have its place for a very small amount of people.  I am crypto's harshest critic but even I was looking to purchase bitcoin a year ago for...online purchases.  Bitcoin has some real value to it, but many people exaggerate that value.  Right now it's more of a trading instrument than an exchange instrument (speaking of the coins not the blockchain technology)

There's a key difference - ignore the visual aspect and look at the labels.  This price surge was getting insane media attention and random joes were buying it up
