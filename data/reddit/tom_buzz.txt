That's really not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the fingers-in-ears, lala-shouting unwillingness to hear anything that might be remotely negative.
During the changetip fad, with the hypothesis that it achieved the success people wanted, try pointing out that centralisation and them holding the keys was probably not great for bitcoin. It was a great way to get a shit load of downvotes.

That's not what we want at all. We want to use crypto to lock the government out, not to better allow them in.
Do you not see how even with that system, it'd be trivial to underreport by not paying 100% of your income into you government-monitored wallet
@_date: 2014-11-15 20:53:16
I'd like to also note that the entire of cryptography is predicated on the fact that dealing with exponentials becomes unfeasible very quickly.
(Or at least appears to be, assuming that P is not NP)
Also, if the current expoential trend continues (of about 10^x ) then a bitcoin will be worth more in dollars than the number of atoms in the universe in the next 50 years.

It depends on what you mean by libertarianism. A lot AnCaps consider themselves, and call themselves, libertarians (maybe the only *true* libertarians), they feel that minarchists are kind of libertarian lite. I don't fall strictly on either side of the fence. If anarchism is possible, I'm all for it, but I'd settle for limited government. I could live with a government reduced to its proper roles of police/courts/defence. I just also believe that constructing a government in such a way that it doesn't grow in scope is near-impossible. Libertarian as a word is just an antonym of authoritarian, it has different connotations in different parts of the world. Some places it's associated with left-wing anarchism most strongly.

I'm not actually sure that the guy above is correct but I'm not going to say 100% either way about that. I'm moderately sure that the only person who sees your IP address is the first peer you pass the transaction to, but I could be wrong.
I've just looked at some of my old transactions on blockchain and the IP doesn't appear to be related to my home IP.
If you send your transactions out into the network via Tor though, that's an added layer of security.

The state didn't "build the internet." Some early important research was funded by the US govt, a lot of equally important research was private. The vast majority of the infrastructure is private. The vast majority of the services that make the internet valuable are also private.

The idea that facebook would use 2-8% of their market valuation (not cash at bank) to buy bitcoin in an attempt to **reduce** risk as a hedge seems slightly insane.

@_date: 2014-11-21 21:03:23
It's an arms race though (whack-a-mole might be a more appropriate metaphor), you'd just send encrypted information in the payload through a supposedly "open" protocol.
There's fundamentally no intrinsic difference between "a binary string which happens to be an encrypted version of some other binary string" and "a binary string."
You can't stop people sending encrypted information through an unencrypted protocol. Even if they had people sat looking at the contents to make sure that something looked like a regular unencrypted format, there's always [Steganography]( (i.e. where you hide your encrypted data in subtle variations to a jpg file)
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:28:51
It's a nice sentiment but that would literally require a million-fold increase on 2011 prices. I'm pretty sure all the bitcoin in existence would then be worth many orders of magnitude more than the entire world economy at that point.

No, no anarchist views taxation as a necessary evil.
I disagree with your "that's not what bitcoin is fighting against."
Read the cyphernomicon and go back to the early days of bitcoin talk and read what people were saying.
There's an attempt to sanitise bitcoin, to make it a nice new piece to improve, paper over the cracks, of the existing financial system and say "no, bitcoin's crazy libertarian/anarchist days are over, the community has grown up now, we have venture funding."
Dark wallet is meant to be an explicit refutation of that.

Ok, let me rephrase to avoid this pedantry: Would it allow bitcoin to live up to its fullest potential?
Clearly a 1TB blocksize could be a problem. Clearly a 1 transaction-per-block size would stunt its usefulness compared to the current 1MB size too.
That's a large part of what this whole debate is about.

Yeah but I kind of feel that's mainly because he didn't want government getting wind of that capability and really understanding it too early, which would let it kill it in the cradle.

There's no way not to benefit from others taxes. There's no way not to consent. That's the problem.
Your argument could be used to insist that you pay taxes even in the most corrupt fascist state.
Just because a society with no taxes doesn't make sense to you, you can't assume it must therefore not be possible. Do some reading.
You owe us that before you start claiming that we need to be violently robbed of a percentage of our income to pay for the imprisonment of non-violent drug offenders and western military adventurism.

@_date: 2014-11-15 15:07:39
It amazes me that people don't see the fact that bitcoin is inherently anarchist, and inevitably allows for the outcomes that their moderate, gradualist world-view would be terrified by.
If bitcoin goes mainstream, states wither and die. They can no longer inflate to pay for things, and they can no longer be remotely sure people are accurately reporting their true income.
The latter is true now, but it becomes a lot easier to hide your income. It's like everyone has a cash-business and as many totally secret vaults as they like.
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:10:45
More than that we need decentralised tipping. When changetip gets big enough it **will** be hacked. Then it'll be another humiliation and confirmation that bitcoin is unsafe. The setback will be greater than the positive in the public imagination and we'll just have another Gox.
Changetip is great culturally, but in its implementation I just see another central point of failure. The dangers of centralisation are a lesson we seem unwilling to learn.
Edit: thanks for my first gold kind stranger! And the tip is most appreciated too!
@_date: 2014-12-20 15:12:44
Which is my point. There is surely a greater than 0 lower bound to transactions per block for the Bitcoin blockchain to be a practical technology.
The current debate is just on whether the 1MB is sufficient, or below that lower bound.

I view paypal as sort of like IBM in the personal computer thing (big, bloated bureaucracy that'll one day be rendered irrelevant) . At the moment we're trying to get some big players of the old guard on board. Once they're on board we'll start seeing a much greater drive towards adoption.
After that we've got our foot in the door, normal people are going to trust "Bitcoin as a payment option on paypal" over our crazy internet gold-fetishist-2.0 pirate drug money.
Once our foot is in the door with the average person, then those companies who can out-compete PayPal just by... you know... not being a bloated corpse like PayPal, will send them the way of myspace and countless other early-mover once-giants in other sectors.

Ultimately, as long as the protocol itself isn't corrupted, we'd benefit by bitcoin being absorbed into the existing infrastructure.
Those of us with the inclination to make use of the decentralisation will find adoption a lot easier when the edges are far more porous to the existing financial system, and vice versa.
Bitcoin is a kind of glorious anti-cancer which will eat away at the inside of those institutions until there's nothing left but for those empty shells to crumble, no longer needed. If old monoliths can find ways to adapt and serve the needs of the customer in a new bitcoin-based world, let them. They'll have been robbed of the powers that make them so dangerous now. 
...As long as we can maintain the integrity of the protocol. No coinvalidation or address validation fees or other such nonsense.
It's why the slow decline of the foundation is great and why projects like libbitcoin need more donations... and more other well maintained reimplementations. Attempts to change the protocol should be as politically deadlocked by as many different factions as possible. That way only truly excellent ideas will be implemented. As much as I greatly admire Gavin, there shouldn't be a "Chief Scientist" any more than there is a "Chief Scientist" of the internet.

Yeah, there's a lot of new bitcoin coming into existence each day. Bitcoin behaves in a price-deflationary way only when demand is outstripping that new supply. This year it hasn't been, hence the loss of purchasing power inherent in an inflationary currency.
I'll still take log-shaped inflation over exponential though.

I bought some at £11, sold at about £100 (badly needed the cash, the major price rises of a year ago started the next day... fuck). My current holdings have an average buy price of ~£550 (~$880) and I have zero intention of selling.
When I bought them at that inflated price I thought the price could go in either direction over the next year, I had no idea really. One thing I did know is that 1-5 years down the line I'd be right. That's the timescale I'm operating on. Fuck the rollercoaster. The people like me who bought and held bitcoin while it was up last April are still the smart ones. Even more so than the people who've bought in the post-$1200 trough.
If your timescale for the investment was any less than two years, you're a get-rich-quick speculator, not an investor. I'm all about long-term value, not price. My bitcoins are a share in the world's first Decentralised Autonomous Corporation. As long as I have that stake, the medium-term price concerns me little.

Privacy is your own responsibility. Publishing your name and address is totally different to someone installing hidden cameras in your house or some other sort of attack on your privacy.

I hate this whole "wealth isn't the be-all and end all" ...wealth is literally life and death, it's whether your society's people can afford medical care (whether socialised or privatised), it's whether your child dies before age 5. Wealth is **the** vital one.
All the other "better things in life" such as family, friendships, etc are made a lot more possible by wealth. This idea that to want to improve your conditions is somehow greedy is dumb. People in the 1800s had it amazing compared to their predecessors, and we have it amazing compared to them... It's not greedy to want to improve our conditions any more than it was greedy for them.

1.01^x is an exponential, that's correct.
This whole thing is also made muddy by the exponential inflation of the monetary base too. Economic growth is also a very small exponential.
I think we can agree that a base 10 exponential is completely unsustainable though :P
Also, there's a critique of the capitalist economic system that it requires exponential growth, but I think that doesn't necessarily require exponential use of resources.

I think it is regional, for you. I've lived in many parts of the UK have not come across any part that has a "tip by default" cultural rule. In fact I'm actually very surprised that this is even controversial.
It's a running joke in the US that "Brits don't tip." Maybe you live in London? I dunno what the rule is there but I can assure you I know no other part of the country where people tip by default. In fact it's one of those noticeable differences people talk about when they visit the states, the fact they have to calculate the tip on top of the cost of the meal.
And it's not like minded people, this is family, friends, coworkers, bosses, acquaintances, whatever. No one in the uk, generally, will tip unless the service is truly exceptionally excellent.

That's sort of the point.
One of the best features of bitcoin is its ability to facilitate tax-evasion on a truly massive scale.
A large amount of people who were into bitcoin early on are crypto-anarchists.
They want to replace the functions of the state with cryptography. If one day the economy and all communication online goes dark to the prying eyes of the state, then the government withers and dies on the vine as more people evade taxes and they have even less resources to chase all those people.
If that's an outcome that scares you, bitcoin isn't for you.

Just a question, do you work in finance? I have a friend who works in the City of London. They accept customers from pretty much anywhere in the world except the US. This is because the regulation is so overbearing as to not be worth the hassle. Irony is, he works for an american firm.
Anyone who works in finance knows that the industry is crazily regulated, it would be hard to have it any more state controlled other than if they just nationalised it.
Moral hazard and fractional reserve caused 2008. It's not in the banks' "selfish" interest to go bust. Austrian Business Cycle Theory provides a pretty excellent model of what happened, and it's why the Austrians were the only ones who predicted that debacle, there's quotes dating back to 2003 of people describing how the housing bubble was being blown and what would happen when it popped.

Most economists thought that everything was wonderful in 2006/2007.

People like you were saying almost the exact same things as you, in very similar discussions, but about housing, in 2007.
And, tbh, tuition cost inflation is even acknowledged by the people who disagree with the "bubble" statement. So in terms of "if the government hadn't pumped up tuition costs...." no-one actually disagrees with that. Just whether the costs are "a bubble."

That's never what actually happened though, or what's expected to happen. In the 1980s, there was a perception that government spending on welfare had decreased. It turns out that this wasn't actually the case. However, even though govt was actually still was spending the same levels as before, charitable donations increased. There's a lot of evidence to show that government welfare often crowds out private charity and replaces it with dependency and bureaucracy. And no, I don't have a paper for that one, I'm sorry. I can't remember where I read it.

Some of the mods also write there, but it's usually a lot less concise. I don't know the quality of the posts on there. They probably have a similar amount of citations, but may not be as limited to purely academic papers.

Yeah, but to imply that the exchanges should pay interest as a default position is to invite the ecosystem to run on a fractional reserve, which we know can end in disaster.
They're not banks, they're exchanges. The benefit you get is the ability to trade. It's the same as putting your money in a forex trading platform, they wouldn't pay interest, and there's no reason for them to. You run the same risks with the company going bust etc with that too.

No, the theory, **does not exist**. There is no economic theory called "trickle down economics", genius. It is a myth. A generic curse word like the way "commie!" is applied to left-wing econ.
The original phrase referred to the New Deal for fucks sake, hardly libertarian:
The term has been attributed to humorist Will Rogers, who said of the New Deal that "money was all appropriated for the top in hopes that it would trickle down to the needy."[2]
"Economist Thomas Sowell has written that the actual path of money in a private enterprise economy is quite the opposite of that claimed by people who refer to the trickle-down theory."

Wrong. The big corporations lobby, hard against a shift towards libertarianism. It means an end to cronyism, corporate welfare, too big to fail, and cosy influence in creating regulatory barriers to entry.
The very rich are strongly, strongly against libertarianism. Pro market is almost the opposite of "pro business" since you want to make it easier for people to compete against them.


Not an actual point. Just some of that emotionalism I was talking about.


It's very tough. And it's tougher in those countries which are poorer. Those countries which are poorer are the ones with less free economies. The correlation is very strong on that.
The US banned "sweatshop labour" in the 90s. The UN itself said "don't do this, the unintended consequences will be awful." The US did it anyway, and scores of children were forced into rummaging through land-fill and prostitution. You can't magic wealth into existence through regulation and banning things that make guilty white people feel uncomfortable. Wealth is accumulated. We went through the phase they're going through 150-250 years ago, and I'm grateful to my ancestors for dragging us through it. Not to mention when those countries achieve our current standard of living, the rich nations in the future will lament their appalling conditions.
I just want to point out that South Korea/Taiwan were fantastically poor, agrarian, peasant economies less than 100 years ago. Relatively free trade put them where they are today. Seeing those kinds of successes is what causing China to tentatively embrace free trade. It works. The evidence is staggering. The main reason there hasn't been a total cultural victory of the economic right is due to the strong influence of the left in academia.

Except it's based on standard, mainstream supply/demand economics.
The only argument against is that the tuition inflation is supposedly not outpacing the growth in utility of having a degree.
That in itself could be skewed by the degree itself being devalued: more people with degrees are getting employed than those without could be because it's being devalued to the level of a general "must-have" like a high-school diploma.
Truth is, non-fringe economics has failed, hardcore, for a while now. The mainstream of academia hasn't been an indicator of quality in understanding/predictions at all. So to use them in some sort of appeal-to-authority fallacy argument is to imbue them with more authority than they really have these days... 
The fringe is growing in popularity due to those failures.
There was a time when mercantilism was the dominant school of thought. There was a time in parts of the world where Stalinist communism was. Something being "fringe" doesn't make it auto-wrong. Only an idiot thinks we're at the final stages of understanding.
All great experiments in economic systems that have ultimately advanced mankind started out as "fringe." Doesn't make them auto-correct, but it doesn't make them auto-wrong either.

Libertarianism doesn't have "policies" as such.
You should really follow the facebook page "Being Classically Liberal." I've been all over the political spectrum, starting out on the far left. So far libertarians are the most rational, level headed political group I know of. I realise has degenerated into insane cultism, and that there are libertarians are weird cultists (Stephan Molyneux's lot for a start), but the average libertarian.
Being Classically Liberal generally cite all of their positions with links to academic papers in respectable journals.


Yes, but people who already know what their position is, and think in tribal terms of just "how do I refute this argument" instead of "does this argument have merit" generally don't get anywhere in terms of finding the truth of things. It isn't just a game of chess where you try to win. I'd much, much rather be wrong and learn something. It's how I became a libertarian in the first place. I was a classic angsty ultra-left-wing teenager. I was raised in a moderately left-wing family.
And with all the assertions about "The mental gymnastics you have to do," etc, etc. I've never heard anyone actually articulate *exactly* why it's such an obviously incorrect viewpoint without resorting to either strawmen, economic myths, ad-homs about the character of specific libertarians, accusations of selfishness (despite a strong belief in private, voluntary charity, and plenty of evidence to show that government welfare simply crowded out private alternatives and replaced them with a worse form of dependency). There's also countless, countless evidence to show that countries with more liberalised economies have higher levels of wealth for all tiers of society, including the bottom 10%, and that tax-and-spend generally removes more economic growth from the system than it replaces. There's Public Choice theory which explains very well why institutions not subject to market pressure tend to be very badly run (think DMV if you're american). How "free market" a country is is also strongly negatively correlated with how war-like they are. And no, the US is not a free market country. It comes in near the middle of the list.
More than Liberals, Conservatives and Socialists, I've seen libertarians resort far, far, far more to academic research and rationality to make their case than the emotionalism and judge-by-intent-not-results nature of those others.
So yeah, those people who claim libertarianism is just an anti-rational cult that's blatantly incorrect to anyone who thinks for 2 seconds isn't really backed up by reality, and those who say it, I suspect are just parroting someone else with limited understanding of the philosophy.

That's literally what you just said. The fact that subsidy *could* inflate prices in a bubble was what you originally refuted as non-mainstream. You were wrong on that.
You've back-peddled into saying "the data doesn't support it," which is what I said openly is one of the interpretations.
However, I also pointed out a way in which the rate of degree-educated people being employed vs non-degree-educated could be accounted for by the devaluing of the degree itself into just a base line that employers expect. In that case you would see the exact same result. Data alone doesn't contain truth, data requires context in order to be "information." You fuck up the context and the data is meaningless.
There are many branches of econ that don't believe in the logical-positivist mathematics-fetishising empiricism of keynesianism and related more mainstream schools. Some of them were once the mainstream school of thought during the greatest increases in wealth the western world saw.
It's actually not unreasonable to reject hyper-mathematicalised economic empiricism, since economics contains no universal mathematical constants to be discovered. No simple, beautiful mathematical equations and truths to be discovered, just loose relationships better described with regular language.
Empiricism is appropriate to physics, but social sciences are too messy to be described in neat, elegant, solid mathematics. There are a great many physicists who also disagree with economics' attempts to dress a social science up as a mathematical science.

You don't sub to "Being Classically Liberal" clearly. In terms of making a case and citing academic research papers, BCL is one of the best libertarian pages out there. They're not actually even Austrians, many of the mods are Chicago-school, so they don't even have a vested interest in finding things to prove Austrian Business Cycle.
So yes "a paper" was linked, an academic, peer reviewed "paper".
Do or don't go look for it, it's up to you. I'm at work and don't have time to find it myself, but it'll be one of the last 20-30 posts, and will be pretty clear that it's talking about "Austrian Business Cycle" if you're skimming.

Yeah, but if you take the electricity cost for all the miners and divide that by the number of transactions, then that **is** the cost of transaction. And it's currently very, very high. I love bitcoin but that's the single biggest thing that worries me about the technology. It **is not** a cheap and efficient way to move cash. We pay a brutal price for decentralisation.
So while the reward does not determine the cost per transaction, it does (when its exchange rate is accounted for) determine what mining difficulties are profitable, which absolutely, 100% **does** determine the cost per transaction.
The fact that cost per transaction has been so high has been the best sign that we've been in a bubble over the past year. You've gotten your chicken and your egg the wrong way round.

Mate, let's be honest. Out of the two of us, I've shown far more tendancy towards open-mindedness than you. From the very beginning you didn't believe there was any reason to believe in a student loan bubble, before you even knew about the theory.
I started out by showing you an article that was balanced, and included criticism of the theory. I've also explained how the data could in fact be viewed as support of a student loan bubble, and why these kinds of empirical statistical analyses can't always be trusted. It's also impossible to do actual empiricism in econ, since you can't isolate specific variables. You have to do sloppy pseudo-empiricism with very, very limited data in an exceptionally chaotic (as in Chaos Theory) system. If you did that kind of "empiricism" in physics, there isn't one journal who would even consider publishing you for a second.

How can you be so blind to this, for someone who's passionate enough to spend this amount of time trolling the internet.
They're also strongly pro gay marriage, and anti-drug war, they're large benefactors of hospitals and charities. Other than not being anti-capitalist, they're basically every liberal's wet dream.
I directly quote Warren Buffet about some new wind farms he's building: "it wouldn't make sense without the subsidy."
The very, very wealthy, the vast majority of them, are strongly against libertarianism because suckling at the government teat is far more profitable than engaging in the market.
Yes, they are the most influential, hyper-rich libertarians. They're also some of the *only* hyper-rich libertarians.
The overwhelming majority of the super-rich got there by being in bed with government in one way or another. Look into it, seriously.


Wrong, Being Classically Liberal had a post only the other day citing all the mainstream academic papers (and the general consensus amongst economists, even Keynesians) that regulation/unions played a very small role in those things, particularly in ending child labour, they found almost no correlation or affect on the trend, which was declining rapidly anyway at the time the regs were introduced.
The reason we work less and have more money, and our children don't have to work, is because the economy is wealthy enough to sustain that now.
