It's not just bank's closing accounts - you wouldn't believe the number of places I've found with "No Virtual Currency" in the terms of service when it comes to accepting payments online. It's insane how quickly that sort of bias has propagated.

While it is true that they may be smart enough to do so, they also may have very specific tastes.  My site is tailored to users who want to be able to request specific custom photos and videos or even soon to come camshows, so that they can have their every desire of their well developed palettes satisfied.
There is a difference between general "free porn" and getting *exactly* what you want :)

Yeah, in beta we don't have a preview running. We just launched 3 days ago, we have wire a few models we are waiting on verification photos from, and 3 active models. Accounts are free and fast. Even though registration is open, i'll create an account for you and pm you the details!

I had only planned on doing this post and the one at the end of beta, do you think I should delete this one and wait until beta ends?

Can I be counted as a supporter? :P You've got my upvote, good luck buddy!
