They are unicode characters, so the combinations like you mentioned don't work everywhere. You can copy-and-paste them from other sites (e.g. Emojipedia) if you don't have a browser addon.
Some of them are singular characters, like ��
Some newer ones are 'combining' characters to indicate sex or skin colour:  �� + �� = ���� (how it appears in Firefox:  )
I generally just use old-style emoticons, on my desktop :)

You can. We do. But I don't see people getting interested in Auroracoin or Spaincoin. In fact, since both launches (especially Spaincoin) were/are being conducted in English, I suspect that they were both launched for the benefit of Anglophone 'stakeholders'.
^edit I don't see people inside those countries getting interested about these country-orientated coins. ^/edit
The idea is really nice, but I don't like the execution. ^edit I think more effort should be directed to converting Bitcoin software to Spanish (and maybe Icelandic, but I think that most Icelandics have English as a second language anyway - mandatory in school). ^/edit
^edit2 The premining thing is another point that has already been made many times. We cannot trust the distributors to work with our data correctly and complete their mission. ^/edit2
^edit3 There's also the very major matter that, when people have this 'countrycoin' currencies, they have nowhere to use it at. What's the point? The places to use it have to be there as well. If everyone suddenly has the coins, there has to also be suddenly places to spend them at. ^/edit3

I think the concept is fairly simple. If a retailer is running a full node, it should be *technically possible* to do the same thing without needing to trust the Mycelium server. That is, with a little bit of programming.

The password encrypts the actual wallet.dat file.
Backups in Bitcoin-Qt are iffy, could be a lot better. Right now, Bitcoin-Qt doesn't have support for deterministic wallets, which means you have to backup every few weeks/days (depending on how many new keys are generated, and thus depending on how many transactions you do) to sync up the new keys that were generated.

I think it's easier for the technically informed to see the value in Bitcoin than those who are not informed, because those who understand it are far more likely to see and believe in its value.

SMS is vulnerable to attacks on your cell phone network. This relies on ECDSA signed messages. 
Other forms of 2FA rely on [hashes of secrets with a timestamp]( which is better than SMS in my opinion (unless you lose control of your secret) because it does not rely on the cell network and the business doesn't need to know your phone number (edit: although some, like Facebook, still want your phone number even when using this method).
edit2: *Regarding reception/connectivity*, I think Google Auth's method is still better than BitID's implementation in the video, since [this method]( requires an Internet connection between the phone and the website to send the message. Google Auth's number output is entered by the user and isn't sent by the device, so you don't need any connectivity on the phone in that case.

There is certainly such a point somewhere along the line, but I don't think that's my intention. I want to use an abbreviation, but at the same time not violate ISO 4217's general accepted format (I know, Bitcoin is not yet recognised by the standard, the key part is "general accepted format"). I don't think XBT is an appropriate abbreviation*, and using BTC as ISO 4217-esque abbreviation would mean we would be using the BT country code (Bhutan).
So, to sidestep all of that, just use something that cannot possibly be construed as ISO 4217 codes.
*edit: Also, there are only 676 possible letter abbreviations if we use X format for cryptocurrencies.
I know why these standards exist, but I also know how they are formulated - and part of the process relies on gathering current industry consensus when making the standard. /edit

I didn't say that they make the best things. ARPANET was far from perfect, even. They make things for their purposes, we ("the free market") put it to our best use after they have used it for a while.
I also never said that the free market was incapable of producing the Internet. I'm saying what *did* happen, which is that the United States Government created TCP/IP for their own purposes. We, the international community of developers and users (in general, humanity that is exposed to the Internet today), gradually added to that base to make it what it is today, a far cry from what it was.

This is one way of solving the issue. Another way is to use off-chain transactions (as already mentioned in this thread). There's a campaign/informational video about why that might be better [here]( Some people don't like the fact that off-chain providers would still be a source of centralisation, but they have the opportunity to be publicly auditable and transparent because they can prove what they hold and ensure that they are practising full-reserve.

Aren't these just using Gyft as middle-men? ^edit Or some other gift card services?
TBH, I think that companies using middle-men or immediately exchanging for fiat puts major selling pressure on the market. Only when they start paying their employees/suppliers in Bitcoins, and when they then go and spend Bitcoins somewhere else, will we see a real economy denominated in Bitcoin. I don't see that happening for a while, unfortunately. ^/edit

* It is more likely to just be vandalism (anti-virus trigger strings uploaded into the block chain to make this sort of thing happen). Since it's just the trigger strings (what the AV software looks for in a file when it tries finding viruses), it is most likely harmless.

This involves real monetary incentives. While it is really awesome, you really don't want people getting into (real physical) fights over some money hidden [in an app/in the ground].

That is agressive and condescending. All you needed to do was provide pure information to prove your point - not the aggressive/rude padding, calling his message FUD, telling him that his assumption is completely irrational and unwarranted.


This is also aggressive - nobody is going to try something that could mess up their client for ~10 hours for all they know. Resyncing takes more than 10 hours, I'm doing a cycle right now because of an unrelated issue.


This is all I needed to know to make me not recommend it to others or try it myself, and gmaxwell provided that information. The reason I fully quoted gmaxwell (edit: and my question to him) instead of saying "YOU'RE FUCKING WRONG GMAXWELL SAYS NO" is so that you can have the right to say that I asked him incorrectly if I did indeed do so (which I don't think I did).


The truth doesn't need your padding around it. I posted a link to redditquette because I noticed your account was brand new, ^edit had negative comment karma, and you were acting far outside of its guidelines. I thought the information would be useful to you and give you insight to how we treat each other around here. ^/edit
&lt;Me&gt; gmaxwell, the guy who told me yesterday that deleting old blk000x.dat files worked went out of his way (vehemently) to prove himself. He says that the client now has checks for when other nodes request early blocks that are not found in the .dat files, and doesn't crash. He still says 'getblock' crashes it, which is enough for me not to try it.    
&lt;Me&gt; s/He still says/He agrees/    
&lt; ... I don't understand what you're telling me.  Some fool told you some stuff and then told you that it crashes.    
&lt;Me&gt; gmaxwell, this is a continuation of something I asked you yesterday (whether deleting old blk000x.dat files would work).    
&lt;Me&gt; gmaxwell, no matter, it's not essential    
&lt; I know but I don't understand what you're telling me there, sounds like you're saying that the person saying it works admitted that it doesn't.    
&lt;Me&gt; gmaxwell, I asked you yesterday whether deleting the old blk000x.dat files would work, and you said it wouldn't - that rpc getblock calls or peers requesting those blocks would crash the client. He says that peers getting those blocks doesn't crash the client, but the rpc 'getblock' does crash the client. That's all.    
&lt; hah. sorry, I am not trying to sound as harsh as I am. I'm trying to figure out if you guys somehow think that crashing is working?  I thought I told you that it would work until a peer tried to pull blocks from you or until you ran some rpcs.    
&lt; OH    
&lt; he's wrong.    
&lt;Me&gt; gmaxwell, can I quote you on that? or should I rather not?    
&lt; go start a new peer against it, it'll crash instantly.    
&lt; Yes, please go ahead.

Blockchain**.info** claims that the cryptography stuff happens away from their server and in your browser. But they could easily plant code on their site to change that fact. By using them, you choose to trust them not to do this. If they don't do this (or something similar), they can't run off with the money.
Most other sites (like what Instawallet and BIPS were) don't do this security thing, and can easily run away with the private keys (and thus, permission to spend the money).

Actually they recently found a bug which gives Dogecoin permanent constant block reward after a certain block. They decided not to fix it because there is no reason to, because it is never intended to become a serious currency, but also because it is a major distinguishing feature from Bitcoin.

That is a step below self-regulation or a self-regulatory body.

I'm not exactly a libertarian, but I think one of the 'philosophical underpinnings' is competing currencies. If one of these currencies end up being (and performing) better than Bitcoin, it will displace Bitcoin as the biggest/most used cryptocurrency.
Also, some cryptocurrencies (very few, actually) have specialised uses in decentralised systems, where if these cryptocurrencies were not to exist, it would require a centralised party to organise the financial aspect of that decentralised system, or bending Bitcoin's own protocol in a way it wasn't designed.
Examples include XCP, which serves the [Counterparty]( protocol, and the hypothetical currency which would serve the work-in-progress [Bitcloud](  protocol.

OpenSSL Heartbleed vulnerability    
11 April 2014What happened    
The version of OpenSSL used by Bitcoin Core software version 0.9.0 and earlier contains a bug that can reveal memory to a remote attacker. See  for details.    
What you should do    
Immediately upgrade to Bitcoin Core version 0.9.1 which is linked against OpenSSL version 1.0.1g. If you use the official binaries, you can verify the version of OpenSSL being used from the Bitcoin Core GUI's Debug window (accessed from the Help menu). If you compiled Bitcoin Core yourself or use the Ubuntu PPA, update your system's OpenSSL. Linux users should also upgrade their system's version of OpenSSL.    
Android    
Android version 4.1.1 is vulnerable to Heartbleed. Try if you can upgrade to at least Android 4.1.2. If you are using Bitcoin Wallet on an Android phone, you should upgrade the app to at least version 3.45.    
How serious is the risk    
If you are using the Windows version of the Bitcoin Core GUI without a wallet passphrase, it is possible that your wallet could be compromised by clicking on a bitcoin:. Payment request link If you are using bitcoind (on Linux, OSX, or Windows) , have enabled the-rpcssl option, and allow RPC connections from the Internet, an attacker from a whitelisted (-allowip) IP address can very likely discover the rpcpassword and the last rpc request. It is possible (but unlikely) private keys could be sent to the attacker.

Not as safe as they would be in cold storage or in an offline wallet.
This will be true until Coinbase supports multi-signature transactions (where they sign a transaction, and you have to sign it too using a private key they don't know), or where they provide some facility for signing transactions using a secure signing device like the [Bitcoin Trezor]( Or any scenario where they do not hold the private key.
edited slightly to clarify the signing process of multisig transactions

[This is a good Wiki article on that](
A block header is comprised of the Merkel root of transactions to be included in that block, the hash of the previous block (thus validating that block), the current target (which is based on the difficulty), the time (in UNIX time - seconds since the epoch), and a nonce. ^(edit: Oh, and a version number.) When people say "block hash" or "hash of the block", it's a hash of all this data. The body of the block (the transactions) is only hashed when finding the Merkel root, which is included in the block header.
That nonce (**n**umber used **once**) has to be continually adjusted (randomly) until the block hash starts with a certain number of zeroes. The higher the difficulty, the more zeroes are needed. This is difficult to do, and easy to verify; and so it constitutes a *proof of work*.
edit2: That proof of work method is based on [Hashcash](

Yes, that would be a good way (I think) of using two-factor authentication, just not the 'normal' method. I would personally prefer it if this method had another name (like multi-signature 2FA or something) - or maybe we can start calling Google's method "TOTP", its proper name.

The problem with this thing is that miners can just include transactions to themselves to validate a block, and there would be no way to tell.

&lt;Mother&gt; Hey sue-dough-nim, come tell your Dad about the story of ***"the Bitcoins"*** [emphasis not my own]
&lt;Me&gt; What story? I already told him about those.
&lt;Dad&gt; But did something new happen?
I had to skip over what the actual bug was because it's complicated, but I basically said it was possible to do withdrawals twice.  I also had to explain what an exchange was. ^e1 I stressed that this bug was in the exchange software, and wasn't removed because of the arrogance of Mt. Gox's own developers, and how they did not heed warnings and advice. But I said that this bug was *based on* the well-known transaction malleability bug^/e1 ^e4 or quirk^/e4 . His own personal opinion is that Mark ran away with the money. ^e2 Which is not the same as my opinion. ^/e2

ICMP pings to IPv4 addresses is not a good way to measure activity IMO.
* Modern routers don't respond to ICMP pings by default
* Many home gateways are now on 24/7
* edit: Some single IPv4's correspond to many hundreds of computer users (edit3: especially true for CGNAT networks - think mobile providers)
edit2: I'm not saying Internet usage in Africa is commonplace - quite the contrary. I'm from South Africa, [one of the more prosperous countries]( They don't have nearly the same Internet usage that we enjoy in Europe. I recognise that Africa will not adopt Bitcoin in the same way as we expect from the Anglosphere.

One guy I was helping in IRC was quite insistent on getting his old Bitcoins back from an old backup, because he believed that it was some of the first satoshis. He clearly held its value higher than the face value (even if slightly). That was my first time seeing this sort of thing. He didn't have that much at all (at face value).
edit to clarify, this doesn't just have to be faith or belief, it's actually possible to prove which block a coin came from, by following its path all the way back to the block it was minted with.

Just a pain in the ass, and would probably take an hour or more. It would be nice if he could have a tool to do it for him.

Yeah, this is the main reason why I cannot bring myself to getting my family into Bitcoin (they know about it) - their security practices are crap.
Edit: I don't see your point with 2FA. If your computer is compromised, 2FA isn't gonna help. It is made for authenticating with a trusted server over an **untrusted network** or from an **untrusted terminal**. If the server is compromised, it doesn't do shit.
Edit2: forgot about untrusted terminal.
Edit3: For your information, this is how most implementations of two-factor authentication work, this is the standard that many developers follow when implementing it. Knowing how it works will enable you to know what it does not protect against: 
Note that it is [only used with websites and networked services]( not programs or operating systems which do not authenticate the user over a network.

What set of instructions did you follow?
* Sometimes it's easy to use the wrong IP address as the destination, or if your router assigns your computer's IP dynamically, the destination IP might not be correct by the time you restart your router.
* It might also be the case that your ISP is blocking access, maybe because it is using carrier-grade NAT ~~(basically letting other people share external IPs with you)~~ ^edit3: (basically letting you share external IPs with other people).
* edit: On a previous router I had, it asked for a 'range' to foward. If I forward a single port (range 8333-8333, for example) it wouldn't work. I would have to assume that the range is *exclusive* and forward 8332-8334.
edit2: Neat name.
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:55:50
Yes. If someone is watching your connection, or has *lots* of nodes, and they see a transaction broadcasted from you that was broadcasted nowhere else on the network previously, they would know it has a higher chance of being your transaction. But since nodes rebroadcast transactions they approve of, the adversary would need a very wide 'field of view' so to speak, to see where the transactions came from *first*.
Default Tor routing is in the pipeline for development. It's just harder to deal with Sybil attacks when every one uses Tor.
^edit Your IP isn't stored in the blockchain, if that's what you're asking. Even the nodes rebroadcasting don't know where it *first* came from. ^/edit
^edit2 The receiver's IP isn't leaked in the same way until they spend what you have sent them. If The Overwatch has a record of your IP too, tied to the transaction, they would know the IP of both sides.^/edit2 
Edit3: changed around 'they'/'you', I got mixed up.

Saw this linked from a completely irrelevant [thread]( and downvoted your comment because of irrelevance.
The major caveat with such short block times is that forking/orphans happen very often. It's even a problem with seconds-long block intervals, nevermind milliseconds! The ping time from London to New York is about 100-130 milliseconds (edit: actually that lower limit is closer to 90), so this won't work in an online setup, at all, seeing as 1/100 of a second is 10 milliseconds.
What would the point of the blockchain mechanism be? Just to send commands/information to other players? Since permanent storage is not required, maybe a Distributed Hash Table would be more applicable, where good old Hashcash is used to determine who controls the game for a few seconds?
edit2: Permanent storage can happen clientside, can't it? Instead of a distributed database (which will need to be modified and updated many times a second x_x). Or be agreed somehow after the game ends. That's how it happens now. By default, the game servers for most PC games don't store demos, but players have the option to record demos, which would store the entire game state (not just what you see on the screen). Some games (namely CS:GO and TF2) have added the option for game servers to host these demos, where players can download them afterwards. TF2 calls this Replay, CS:GO calls it GOTV.

I'd like it if cryptocurrencies adopted their own abbreviation standard which does not fit, and cannot possibly be construed as needing to fit, into the [ISO 4217]( standard.
An example of a cryptocurrency currently doing this is Dogecoin, using the abbreviation DOGE instead of DGE or DOG. I think a four letter abbreviation (which is nothing like ISO 4217) would be better for Bitcoin as well, avoiding awkward X's and such.
But there are already too many opinions about this.

I'm not completely sure what the differences are for each version, but that verison number is used for, when contacting other nodes, determining what features that other node likely has. What I do definitely know for sure is that very old versions (i.e. older than 70001 on the case of that website) are ignored.

Apart from increasing block size, one can also move some 'every day' transactions off-chain, using transparent* payment processors which use the blockchain as a clearing house, and from which you can withdraw all your funds at any time.
*With Bitcoin it's possible for an entity to prove how much Bitcoin they have, and thus prove that they are not using fractional reserve or claiming to have more than they really have.

Transaction fees go to the miners which solve the blocks. In other words, the miners are paid transaction fees in return for the transactions to be included into the blocks.
Some people (not me, really) aren't convinced that transaction fees would support mining in the very long term. Cryptocurrencies which follow different rules exist (Proof of Stake mining, though that is a developing concept, and there's also constant block reward currencies out there).

It's really hard for them to put backdoors in an open source thing, especially something as rigorous as a mathematical algorithm. They've tried to put backdoors in BSD before (IIRC), and failed.
And still, it's just the hashing algorithm that is SHA-256. It's just the thing that confirms the blocks are the real blocks and that significant work has been done to find them. If we have to change **ECDSA** if it came down to it, that would be very easy to do. Your Bitcoins are not protected by SHA-256, only the transaction processing system is enforced by it.
edit: And [this essay]( seems helpful in figuring out whether an encryption standard may be compromised. Probably not relevant to SHA-256 as much **because SHA-256 is not an encryption algorithm**. If you really know how mining actually works, then any exploit that doesn't reduce the speed at which a block is found would really not matter in the scope of Bitcoin mining.
edit2: A tl;dr of that essay is basically: random number generators are a greater weakness than the encryption standard itself,  partially because the random number generator gets less attention from the implementors ("the procedure is optional, [...] most implementations of the Dual_EC_DRBG won't [do the procedure which would make it more secure]").
edit3: I asked in  ([gmaxwell]( is a core dev):
&lt;Me&gt; What would the effect of a collision attack on SHA256 be on Bitcoin (such as the one found for MD5)? Would it be possible to substitute blocks or cause general chaos?
&lt; you can probably extract some mildly annoying but easily fixed DOS attacks from it, but thats about it.

I am not sure how the first part of your question is related to the second, but that's probably because I don't completely understand the second part.
Yeah, many people don't want to trade Bitcoin right now because it's such a hassle to deal with the exchanges.
What kind of business? An exchange? How would a business 'hold' Bitcoin while charging 0% fees? Those bitcoins are part of the trades which happen across the exchange. Someone else bought them, the exchange can't hold it without cheating (which would mean *more* friction - because people can't withdraw).
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:59:14
You have a point. For me, it isn't much effort to triple check things.
Technically speaking (and I think Armory does this with their paper backups) incorrectly entered keys can be partially brute forced rather quickly, thanks to the Base58Check encoding. The encoding includes a checksum at the end of the string which lets software know if there was a typo on input. But I don't think any solution for this exists yet. Wouldn't be very difficult to code it.
@_date: 2014-05-24 14:55:21
If the transaction is still unconfirmed, it is up to Cryptsy to re-send it once it falls out of the mempool (or of there is any other related error). The lack of this happening may also be why the OP's problem is occurring, but they should reply to requests from customers :/

They introduced Western-style borders upon people who have never lived under such systems, and left multiple ethnic groups fighting over the same patches of land. The most popular example to Westerners is probably [Rwanda](
edit: In slight contrast, there's Botswana as an example, which lives in peace and is filled with vastly more Tswana people than any other ethnic group.


I agree with these points, but the last one has more dynamics and is also complicated.

A wallet is not a public/private keypair. A wallet does the following things:
* ^edit6: Generates and ^/e6 manages many (or in some cases just one) key pairs
    * Each keypair has an address associated with it, [derived]( from the pubkey
* Signs transactions you want to send using your private keys
* Communicates with the Bitcoin network, sending out your transactions as well as rebroadcasting blocks and transactions it approves of
   * Bitcoin-Qt and bitcoind (among some others) also host the entire blockchain for the good of the network
   * edit5: Most mobile wallets I *think* only broadcast your transactions and don't actually rebroadcast anyone else's.


It's not recommended because the wallets won't share change addresses. Hierarchical deterministic wallets may be easier to share, but I still wouldn't recommend it because wallet software is just not built with that in mind.


The privkey is generated randomly (edit: or deterministically), and the pubkey is derived from this privkey using the ECDSA algorithm (specifically the secp256k1 curve).


^^edit2 keypair], would find it already contains someone else's bitcoins?
Astronomically, unimaginably unlikely if your random number generator is any good - there are far too many possible key pairs.
edit3: Some users refer to keypairs as 'wallets' as you've done here. They may say "give me your wallet address" or sometimes "paste your wallet here" when they mean a single address from your wallet. The Bitcoin network itself does not see 'wallets' as groups of keys, and on a technical level, the block chain is not aware of addresses.
edit4: Also, there are some types of web wallets (like Mt. Gox accounts were and how Coinbase accounts are now) that don't actually manage the keys for the user directly, but manages keys for everyone collectively and just puts your balance (just a number) in a huge database next to your username, and promises to send the amount "owned" by you to where you want. Web wallets like Bitalo, Greenaddress.it, and blockchain.info's MyWallet service, don't work this way and actually do some key management for each user in the user's browser.

If ECDSA gets broken before SHA-256, SHA-256 will still protect the addresses until the first transaction from that address. 
The transactions are messages which say "these coins now belong to this address, and I have the right to say this because I own the private key of the sending address". The addresses are [hashes of public keys]( not the public keys themselves. So if ECDSA gets broken, the money in 'old' addresses will be protected until the first spend (at which point, the public key would be exposed, and the hypothetical exploit in ECDSA would allow the exposure of the private key).
All of this is one reason why people are advised to use one address for each transaction.


Yes. I asked in  on Freenode about this a few months ago, the response was that it could be done, but currently would be very risky to do. It would need a lot of testing. It would just require new op codes and transaction formats (so that you could say "this money now belongs to this *version 2* address".
So yeah, from what I heard, I think everything you're asking there is a "yes".
Also, sometimes theoretical exploits come out before proven exploits (i.e. it can be done, but computers aren't powerful enough yet ^edit: like the [ones against SHA-1]( look for the phrase "fewer than 2^x operations") where an algorithm may be significantly weakened, but still okay for general use (for now). At that point, I think we'll start switching to a different algorithm.

It will go through eventually. If the network hasn't seen and approved of it, it is still technically 'yours' and can be recovered.
The reason this hasn't gone through is related to the [prioritisation and transaction fee]( Nodes won't forward transactions they wouldn't mine. ~~Also, if the transaction is based on another unconfirmed transaction, it wouldn't be sent forwarded either.~~ But if you read that link, it says that the age of the transaction is taken into account when prioritising. So the transaction will go through eventually, and your wallet will rebroadcast it every now and then.

It's already possible to include data like this in the blockchain through the use of transactions - just encode the data in 160 bit chunks and use these chunks as hash160 addresses to send money to. The money won't ever be recoverable (unless you find a private key which successfully manages to result in the same hash160), but those hash160's (which aren't really hashes, they are the actual data) will be transmitted and stored in the blockchain.
**tl;dr:** nothing prevents you from substituting hash160's for arbitrary data. ^edit Except the cost of the transaction.

Technically speaking:
All the transactions included in a block get their fees added up, and those fees get added to the block reward for the whole block. The miner who mined the block is the only one to receive those fees, as part of their block reward.
^edit Thus, the fees attached to a transaction is *incentive* for the miner to include that particular transaction in their block. If the miner is acting rationally. ^/edit 
Practically speaking:
Mining pools (where lots of miners decide to work on the hashing together) sometimes keep the fees for themselves and send only the block reward (without the added fees) to the participating miners. It depends on the pool whether or not they do this.
[Here's a graph of transaction fees over time]( I think the interval is 24 hours (i.e. there has been a total of 15 BTC of fees in the last 24 hours of that graph). ^edit The spikes are raw transactions gone wrong, where someone chose not to use the automatic methods for authoring transactions and accidentally sent an extraordinarily large fee, as a result of a misunderstanding regarding how transactions work. ^/edit

Well spotted. 
There are an average of 7609 or so typoes you can make to one address string (edit: where the base58check would fail for the vast majority of them).

* A more correct one would be: "there is a 1 in 564500 chance of having an address for which such a typo exists where the four byte checksum would not change".
Though that 564500 number is *still* incorrect because I haven't excluded typoes that happen in the checksum or in the version number.

^edit: jcorgan is Johnathan Corgan. gmaxwell is Gregory Maxwell. ^/edit
&lt;Me&gt; Say, has there ever been a proper rationale written over why a 10 minute confirmation time is good/best/most beneficial/least disadvantageous?
&lt; it takes time for the network to reach consensus on what the "best" chain is, in the face of finite propagation time and miners submitting discovered blocks close in time
&lt; shorter block times result in more difficulty in reaching that consensus, and also means each block is easier to generate, so the value of block confirmations is decreased
&lt; there is a relatively wide band of workable times, that present tradeoffs in convergence stablity, network scalablity, decenteralization, vs the time to irreversability.
&lt;Me&gt; Okay, thanks
&lt; Generally since mining is a [Poisson] process you're not going to get away with expecting instant confirms no matter how fast they are (at least within the range of viable times), so 10 minutes leans a bit more towards decenteralization and convergence stability. but 8 or 12 would have basically been the same thing.

A *full* node has a complete copy of the block chain, and also verifies transactions and rebroadcasts blocks and transactions it approves of.
An SPV node (**S**imple **P**ayment **V**erification) does not need a complete copy of the block chain to approve of transactions, and only maintains a list of the unspent outputs (as far as I know).

Typically yes. For high value transactions, merchants would be advised to wait for a couple of confirmations. ^edit2 That is, unless they have some other sort of risk mitigation in place (like taking down the customer's details, or insurance). I hear it's practically safe to wait even 2 or 3 confirmations, instead of the standard 6. ^/edit2


Yes, but unlikely. Practically, if a double-spend attack occurs, it would have to be less than ~10 minutes after the purchase is made (by sending another transaction with a higher fee but based on the same inputs and before the next block is found), unless the attacker has enough mining power to manipulate which transactions are accepted.

Maybe would not need to be a 'single click' - if websites could provide Bitcoin addresses in a standardised way (HTTP headers or something), the browser extension could (at the user's choice) track where the user has been, and periodically send tips to the sites' corresponding Bitcoin addresses (in one big sendmany transaction).
 * Opens up opportunities for user behaviour tracking by giving unique address to each user and then watching the block chain		
 * Browser extensions are weak places to put money
 * Address would have to be signed or provided over TLS connection - any circumstance which allows an attacker to modify the content of the transmission would allow an attacker to put their own address in there.
edit: Another idea I have: Advertising network where people can opt-out of all advertising and tracking by paying the network (^edit2: I think this might be something that already exists ^/edit2 ) 
* The user would store a cookie or have a browser extension which would send a signed token to the server, or something.
* The user would be supporting content-creators without seeing adverts. The proceeds of this method would go to the content creators of any	website which the user goes to visit (instead of ad revenue).

Also, where he transfers the address to the other computer, would it not be easier to just run his web browser on the first computer? :V

As far as I can tell, it's using the hash of the file contents as the hash160 (the address), not the private key. The coins sent to that address will not be recovered, they will exist as a proof of existence of that hash. And yes, there's no need for a third party service, it's just for convenience. I see no security drawback - the third party service never reads the actual file.
**edit:** Not the file *contents*, but the Merkle root, derived from many files' contents.

Companies can't just expect magic to happen when they throw money at it. Each company (or company type - exchange, wallet, etc) implements Bitcoin slightly differently. Testing pre-release versions of bitcoind, for example, is very important, so that bugs can be spotted and worked around early. It's likely that some bugs that are found are edge cases that the core developers wouldn't have thought of or encountered in their (thorough) general-use tests.

It doesn't make sense for a currency to be just for one 'industry' - the point of a currency is so that you can make money denominated in that currency and then spend it on something completely different, all without having to resort to bartering.
I'm all for currencies to exist with special features, though, like [Counterparty]( and other currencies which are currently referred to in our little section of blogs and media as "Bitcoin 2.0". I'd also hear about the special feature that Potcoin provides which supposedly bolsters privacy. 
Why wasn't that released as a general purpose currency? Why tie it to a single product at all?

I'm not talking about the colonialism itself, I'm saying that the countries were left in a bad and unstable state. My comment was prompted by you saying that we should compare South Africa to other countries ruled by black people. I recognise that South Africa has bad leadership which is bad for the people (and everyone, apart from those in leadership themselves). At the same time, I don't think Apartheid was executed in a manner good for the people either. Maybe *less bad*. Let's just say that the sharing was disproportionate, and leave it at that.
When you say "*complete* bullshit", are you denying the Rwandan genocide took place because of rivalries between the Hutus and Tutsis, which were bootstrapped by the Belgians?
edit and disclaimer: I recognise and take to heart that former colonialist entities of Europe, and current countries of Europe, are not the same things and the latter should not be blamed for the former's actions.
edit2: To clarify, I think that most countries in Africa which contain more than one ethnic group (especially those at conflict) should have been split up so that each single ethnic group controls their own respective patch(es) of land (and resources, and solar energy, and Nile, and so on). When the colonists still had influence, they had the power and full opportunity to perform this action, but never did (except for the failed Apartheid experiment of homelands).
edit3: And for the race vs capability thing, white people also run shitty countries sometimes, especially when corruption is involved. The chain of corruption (and bad leadership) in Africa stretches very far into history and is embedded in the culture. But it's also embedded in Latin America, for example. And most of SEA/India. And China... and Russia (until recent crackdowns in the latter two cases). So I see no real correlation with race vs corruption.

BitPay should also generate invoice IDs and give you the transaction IDs (unfortunately, these are the parts I'm unsure of).

SHA-256 and Bitcoin are not directly connected. SHA-256 is used in plenty of stuff apart from (and before) Bitcoin.

In the context of usage in this community (not just this subreddit) [and also Wikipedia and its respective citations]( "fiat" refers to the opinion that government currencies are "backed by faith" in that government - there is no intrinsic value and not even limited supply. These currencies are only backed by the will of a government, and the value that the general public derives from these currencies is based on the government's word alone. ^edit Without the decree of the respective government or similar body, that government currency is just [pieces of paper/tokens of metal/numbers in computers] and no longer is a government currency. ^/edit
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are backed by no governments' words, and the value that the public derives from it is based on the value the public derives from it (market value), as well as and in turn, its unique features and limited supply

If a transaction takes [more than 15 seconds or so]( to propagate, there must be a technical problem on the user's side.
edit: I've come across at least one case where this was caused by a rounding error in the sender's client (Bitcoin-Qt), where the client attached a fee which was less than what was needed for it to be included in a miner's block, in miners with default prioritisation settings. This problem was made worse by newer Bitcoin clients (I think Bitcoind, Bitcoin-Qt, and bitcoinj) not forwarding transactions that they wouldn't have mined. So this person's transaction was stuck in limbo for a couple of hours.
The guy was rightly upset by this, it was his first transaction ever. I think this bug is fixed in v0.8.6.
I have seen an idea floated in the past where people can attach fees to transactions which have already been sent. It's technically possible to do this by sending a transaction again using the same inputs, but... 
* I don't think nodes forward transactions which use inputs they have already seen in other transactions (meant to inhibit double spending), and
* What if the merchant wants to increase the sender's transaction's priority? It would certainly be nice to do that, somehow.

The entire network will know about a block once it's solved, because the block is broadcasted and recorded on every node which performs blockchain hosting (Bitcoin-Qt and bitcoind, mainly).


Blocks are tiny at the moment (mostly under 0.5 MB). The difficulty ensures that only one block is found every 10 minutes (on average), which allows more than enough time for the entire network to know about each block.

You can export the private key from Bitcoin Core and import it into Electrum.
edit: If you don't feel up to doing all of this, you can just wait for it to sync. It's already in the address, as said. /edit
To export from Bitcoin Core:
Go to Help &gt; Debug Window &gt; Console tab
Enter the following commands:
    walletpassphrase yourPasswordGoesHere 120
(The above command is only needed if you set a password on your wallet file. This is needed because your private keys are stored in an encrypted form, protected by your password. The number at the end is how many seconds the client should leave the wallet unencrypted for)
    dumpprivkey 1theAddressYouToldCryptsyToSendTo
    walletlock
This should give you a long string which starts with the number 5. This is a private key, it is the permission to spend money sent to its respective address, so it should be kept secret.
In Electrum, go to the Console tab and type the following command (with the brackets and the quotes)
    importprivkey("5yourVeryLongPrivateKeyGoesHere")
You should get a response like this:
    [
        "Keypair imported: ", 
        "1theAddressYouToldCryptsyToSendTo"
    ]
I'm using Electrum 1.9.5, but the instructions for 1.9.8 should be very similar. The address should now appear under the "received" tab in its own "Imported" section. You should refrain from using a single address in two different clients, they can get confused easily. If I were you, I'd send it from that imported address to one of my own addresses in Electrum. This wouldn't be needed if you decided to stop using Bitcoin Core, though.

Go for a wired home network if you can, or employ some separation between your wired and wireless networks ^edit2: (software firewalls is one example) ^/edit2 . Less surface for attack. If you use wireless networks, standard stuff applies: WPA2 encryption with a long and random password. I change mine every year or so (it's a pain with lots of cell phones in the house, and a printer without a QWERTY keyboard).
Most people who know about this stuff would recommend Linux for an operating system because there are less exploits and viruses made for it. But you might end up hurting yourself by not knowing how to use it well, and it takes a lot of time to learn. 
If you have Mac OS, keep using that (edit3: "less malware" thing applies to Mac OS too). But keep Linux in mind. You can download and burn a free LiveCD of Ubuntu if you want to just try it out. ^(CDs are slow though, the speed is not realistically represented.)
edit: Also, another reason why people recommend open source stuff in general (including Linux) is because the source code is auditable by anyone who can read it. For Windows and Mac, backdoors *can technically* be inserted without people outside spotting it.

Bitcoin transactions don't necessarily need to happen directly from wallet to wallet over the Bitcoin protocol - it could be implemented through SMS, really, in the same way as M-Pesa as long as people can trust the centralised provider. You could have an agency operating in [destination country], where people working in [sending country] can send Bitcoins to, and have them directed to a phone number. This phone number can then have the right to request a transfer of those Bitcoins to a different phone number or Bitcoin address (though I don't think entering a Bitcoin address on an old phone is easy x_x) or even an M-Pesa account tied to the same phone number.
You get my drift: Internet access isn't required for remittances to happen with Bitcoin. But I still recognise that it won't be as easy and fluid as it is where Internet access is ubiquitous. It takes some entrepreneur to make the idea above work, and there would of course be all sorts of trust caveats to sort out, and the end users won't understand it, and so on.

Mt. Gox would only process transactions *quickly* to Japanese bank accounts. It's pretty hard to get a Japanese bank account without a Japanese work visa. So that's the main barrier, but there's also fees.

I see your points. Currently I'm not sure what to agree with, but I'd also like to say that off-chain providers don't seem so bad once you only do little transactions through them (less than the value of 100 or 200 USD) since the fees of doing so on the blockchain would (hypothetically) become prohibitive. ^edit But fees for larger transactions on the blockchain (not off-chain) would hypothetically be a smaller percentage of the price.

The transaction fees are not hardcoded into the "rules" currently. It's technically possible to construct a raw transaction with many inputs and no fee, and then try to send it. It will just take a very long time to get through. What the developers have done is change the defaults in the Bitcoin nodes which forward the transactions, as well as the miners, so that they accept and forward transactions with a different fee.
Fees [are not the only thing that goes into this calculation]( though. Size (kilobytes) and age are specifically involved, as well as value (in Bitcoins).
I hope that re-explanation helps.

If you read Satoshi's paper, you see there that Bitcoin was originally envisioned as a payment system for the Internet, not specifically for grocery store scenarios.
The problem of zero-conf transactions is partly solved by listening to how many nodes have heard your transaction on the network. Nodes won't broadcast transactions which use the same input as one it has already heard and declared valid (it would be an obvious double spend). With this in mind, it would require a lot of hashing power to make sure your ~~transaction~~ ^edit double spend attack ^/edit enters the ~~network~~ ^edit block chain ^/edit . It isn't worth it for minor purchases. It's reasonable to make the customer wait for confirmations for major purchases (very large television, car, etc).
It's also being solved by the Payment Protocol, which is on its way in, but I'm not sure exactly how that works.

Yeah, I don't disregard the general ideology/meaning/thought in your statements. I guess my definitions of 'politics' and 'ideological' are different.


Yes, I also agree with this. But in my mind, it's still a form of politics (i.e. how we get changes done in the world, and how we decide to do *that* in the first place). Politics isn't always people sitting in a large room voting over things that they are never directly involved with. It can also be going out there and getting it done yourself, whatever motive you have.
The opposite form of this would be something like [Project Cybersyn]( a rather depressing concept where people (or computers) who make decisions are completely isolated from the things those decisions would affect. They're only fed data from the outside world.

Apparently the Mycelium wallet can do this too, and technically speaking, any full node with enough connections is capable of doing this (with some programming).
edit: Nodes don't rebroadcast transactions with the same inputs as transactions it has already heard. So it's reasonable to assume that when most of the network has heard a transaction, it's way more difficult to double spend. This is the mechanism that Mycelium and BitPay uses, I guess.

Okay, but.. Firstly, you would need to pay for the costs of running the systems. Secondly, most businesses don't do things like this "for the greater good ^and ^our ^own ^eventual ^profit " unless they have considerable influence (i.e. Google encouraging the education of computer science in British schools - they will reap benefit, eventually, but no small business would try to do this and think about getting returns).
^edit No real reason it couldn't work, though. Just need to find a way to do it easily with all these regulations around. ^/edit
One thing Bitcoin really enables is 'autonomous agents' ([talk by Mike Hearn about that]( because you don't need to be human to use Bitcoin. An autonomous agent running the exchange could work better and actually break even - the agent could pay for its own hosting, upgrades, insurance and so on, provided that the agent can spend Bitcoin to get those things. The trouble is, you still need to be human to own a bank account, and the whole concept of "depositing/withdrawing fiat" falls flat unless a human gets involved in ownership.

This happened because (according to that thread) difficulty dropped too low and an attack became cheap and relatively easy. Bitcoin's hashrate is too high - an attack like that could only be done by a government, or other extremely well-resourced entity.

You buy Bitcoin for conventional currency... but what are you willing to exchange in return for Bitcoin, and vice versa? How much milk, how much coffee, how much bread?
That is *also* the value of Bitcoin (and pretty much any currency, taking out of account any sort of manipulation). It doesn't really matter *what* Bitcoin is being exchanged for (or the other way around if you're a merchant)
Due to the natural but abnormal (?) circumstances of volatility, most merchants are basing their prices in fiat, and do the conversion at the point of sale. That's just a practical difference while there is so much volatility. (edit: That should be temporary.)
@_date: 2014-05-14 15:13:36
Shouldn't it work out the same over time as normal pools, with all the variances?
@_date: 2014-01-29 02:38:07
More adoption &gt; more usage &gt; more liquidity &gt; less volatility.
I think. I'm not an economic expert, but that's what I keep reading.
edit: When people start getting paid in Bitcoin and spending their money in Bitcoin, and also when merchants start paying their suppliers in Bitcoin, is when I think there will be more stability. Step by step. Also, people keep saying that Bitcoin will co-exist with fiat currencies. I guess that's completely possible, but I think competition is more likely than mere co-existence.

They're a pool. You can point a miner at it and mine there.

Looks like it's in their hands. One technical error that could have happened is that the transaction they sent out was based on another unconfirmed transaction that was paid to them with a low fee (which would mean that it would take a long time to confirm). But I think them failing to initiate the transfer is equally likely.


Yeah, it's still up to them to do the transfer, though.

No, I think this is a more accurate representation of this reasoning:
* Lots of people were skeptical of the internet when it started to become widely known.
* The internet was revolutionary.
* Bitcoin is becoming well-known, and lots of people are skeptical
* Therefore **all the sceptics are not necessarily right, and there is little evidence to show that they may be right**.

Cheers! I've been wanting to do this for a while. Sometimes I want to make a tiny transaction, or one with many inputs, and don't really care if it takes a day to confirm. I found Bitcoin Qt's soft forcing of transaction fees very uncomfortable, and knew that it could be bypassed, it just wasn't worth the $0.05 every time.
@_date: 2014-03-30 19:21:36
The agency would be able to organise this transaction, they would hold the bitcoins for you, you would just need to tell it to "send 0.0428 bitcoins to the phone number 0708 xxxxxx". 
^edit The destination phone number would then be notified of its receipt, and be guided through creating an account with this agency, or converting the funds to M-Pesa's system. Similar to what happens when you send Bitcoins to an e-mail address from Coinbase. ^/edit
That's still unsafe, but about just as unsafe as M-Pesa is now. [AFAICT]( they only use your mobile phone number and PINs as authentication, which isn't very good.
As I said, major trust issues. Smartphones may help (by being able to generate keys and hold bitcoins themselves) but are not as secure as computers.

It wouldn't really make a difference, but... I've started going through New York City on that map and seeing which places are duplicates. I found one dentistry that is a duplicate - the building and the office(s) were listed as separate entries. To properly disambiguate, someone would have to go there physically and see what's up and whether they are separate (whether the dentistry owns the entire building or what). Anyway, I removed the "payment:bitcoin" tag from the 'node' and left the one on the 'path' (the building). 
I'll go through the rest of the city (as well as my own closest metro, London) as I get time, seems like duplicates are a little problem.

This is actually a valid point, even though the "free market" and competition stuff means that a business would probably lose money by doing this, in the long run.

* If there's a communication error with the network at the moment you send the money, then the transaction might not be seen by any other nodes. (edit: your node will rebroadcast it at a random interval (like tens of minutes to around 2 hours) if you keep it open - random because if all nodes rebroadcast in synchronicity, the effect is that of a DDOS)
* The block interval is rarely up to two hours.
Was your transaction propagated to the network? You can check this by entering the TXID into  - you can get the TXID by right clicking the transaction and selecting "See transaction details". The TXID is a long hex number like this:

@_date: 2013-11-14 14:18:23
Your ideas are good, you're thinking on the right path. Some people have been doing open source projects and accepting Bitcoins or altcoins for donations.
There are various websites offering a way to connect programmers with clients using Bitcoin as a medium of exchange ([this is one example I found fairly high up on DDG's results]( (edit: but it looks fairly crap, nobody is buying services or all demand is fulfilled?)
You could also host game servers or VPSs using any initial investment you may have, and accept Bitcoin. I think game servers are a safer option here (given that people might host all sorts of terrible things on conventional VPSs if you don't watch it), but may be higher maintenance.
Good luck :)

Difficult to say, but I've seen a video saying that it will be possible in the future. The Bitcoin protocol and network has many features which are not yet implemented in the clients. They won't be implemented, probably, until the reference client (Bitcoin-Qt) implements them.
It's completely possible to tell the network that coins are unspendable before a specific timestamp or block height, but I'm unclear about the technical details. (edit2: correct me if I'm wrong, wizards)

Just the keys - the permissions to spend it.


Generally yes, but it's more complicated than that if you use Bitcoin-Qt.
If you use the same wallet.dat file as you backed up, it might get more complicaed. Bitcoin-Qt generates 100 keys and puts them in a pool of keys for you to use. All of them are stored in wallet.dat. If you start using these keys up, new ones will be generated, bringing it out of sync with the backed up copy.
Any wallet that is *deterministic* would only need to be backed up once and does not get out of sync. ^edit2 All the keys you use are generated from the same seed. ^/edit2 Armory and Electrum have this feature (where you write down a code and it's backed up forever).

The directories don't distinguish between the two categories (places which accept using intermediaries which convert to fiat, and places which accept on their own account). But I think most of them accept using intermediaries because it's easier for the merchant. As I say, suppliers and workers also need to get paid.
In the end, if Bitcoin gets more mainstream, more suppliers all the way to the point of manufacture are likely to accept Bitcoin as payment, and conversion will not be needed. By that time, workers will also get paid in Bitcoin.

In my opinion, it isn't legitimate unless people are actually using Bitcoin to buy and sell goods and services, instead of just investment.

Quite simply nothing. The difference is it puts the governments' central banks, the people, and the businesses, all on equal footing. But remember, not all available Bitcoins are for sale in return for fiat, and not even two-thirds of the supply has been made available in the first place yet.

The best way IMO is to provide a product or service in return for Bitcoin. One reason I would do this is because I don't trust exchanges not to fudge the numbers.
edit: Remember that what you are finding difficult here **is the act of currency exchange**. This is not easy with old-fashioned money, either. Most people buy goods and services using money they earned, without exchanging it for different money.

Yes, this is something that will happen while people expect the fiat price of Bitcoin to rise so fast. People don't like spending things that will increase in value soon. I don't think that phenomenon will exist when the price stabilises. Hopefully one day we'll value Bitcoin in the amount of goods and services it can provide, not exchange rates. :)

Okay, I got a quick-and-dirty solution here. I suck at bash so it's probably really ugly.
    $ scrot -s ~/scrot.jpg &amp;&amp; zbarimg ~/scrot.jpg &amp;&amp; rm ~/scrot.jpg
    $ scrot -s ~/scrot.jpg -e 'zbarimg $f' &amp;&amp; rm ~/scrot.jpg
In cases where 'import' is seeing things, 'scrot' sees what we actually see. The -s flag means that you can drag over any part of the screen you want to select (the cursor doesn't change before you drag). I don't think pipes work well with scrot.
    $ RNDNAME=~/$(pwgen -s 12 1).jpg &amp;&amp; scrot -s $RNDNAME -e 'zbarimg $f' &amp;&amp; rm $RNDNAME
The pwgen command makes sure that the script doesn't accidentally overwrite a file in the folder which happens to be named the same thing.

Don't put all your valuables in an online wallet, you'll probably regret it. If you don't want to spend ages downloading a blockchain, try Electrum. It lets you stay in control of your private keys while not needing to download the blockchain.

This might have the unintended consequence of accidentally creating a regulatory infrastructure for Bitcoin ("we'll never do this, we'll always do that"). But I think if there is to be a constitution, some of the values included should be about mining ratio.
[It's possible for a miner controlling 25% of the network to double spend 5% of the time, even after 6 confirmations]( (GHash.io is close to this, others have been over this in the past) An ideal ratio for pools seems to be around 2-5% of total network hashrate. If a pool goes uncomfortably over this, they should voluntarily split or limit themselves or their marketing in order to keep trust (that has also happened before, can't remember which pool D:).

He takes a few minutes to get to the point. I don't think it's a bad idea, while Bitcoin remains volatile. I just don't like how it relies so heavily on exchanges. I don't trust them not to fudge the numbers. 
I will summarise his concept:
Currently, when someone pays for something with their smartphone to a store owner, they scan a bar code and Bitcoins are transferred from the phone to the merchant. Under current circumstances, most merchants convert this directly to local currency (Euro).
Currently, when you make payments with any other mobile service other than Bitcoin apps, they tend to be walled gardens. The merchant has to have the right equipment or technologies to accept payments in this standard.
What this guy proposes is to use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange of goods and services, but wherever funds are stored, to exchange them for local currency. Whenever XBT funds are transferred to the Bridgewalker app, they are exchanged for EUR, and the balance is in EUR. Whenever EUR funds are exchanged out of the Bridgewater app, they are exchanged for XBT. 
So what you have is a payment system which is compatible with Bitcoin (any Bitcoin payment system which uses Bitcoin addresses), which is always denominated in a currency the user is familiar with, and which isn't as volatile as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-16 16:03:14
In the event that happened, I reckon that many miners would leave BTC Guild and participate in the smaller pools. 
I hope that would happen, anyway.
GHash.io owns much of its own hashing power in the form of the CEX.io 'commodity exchange'. So I think any migration of miners would happen from BTC Guild.
I'm more worried about [this]( - insert any pool's proportion (GHash.io's is 0.25, for example). At GHash.io's ratio, double spending is possible 5% of the time, even if block confirmations happen six times. 


I think spreading the word is probably the easiest way, and by not investing on CEX.io (a commodity exchange which operates on GHash.io. They trade in GHS units - so called "cloud hashing"). edit: A lot of newcomers to Bitcoin want to mine, but don't have enough money to invest. They think that places like CEX.io would make them money, but in reality, CEX.io sells GHS at an overpriced rate compared to hardware providers. Mining is unprofitable at the moment anyway, unless you live in a place with cheap or free electricity. Hopefully people will see sense soon. The next difficulty jump happens on Monday.
edit2: It's also important to note that should something like you mentioned happen, then the community will remember it for a while. It hasn't happened before. IIRC, BTC Guild has reached &gt;30% before, but voluntarily shut down some of its own miners for the benefit of the community.

5 blocks each of 1 MB in size coming every 10 minutes is 5 MB every ten minutes. In effect, you are increasing total blockchain size anyway. To a much larger extent than just increasing block size.

1. Yeah, but don't confuse that with confirmations, which happen in the process of mining. All you would need to do is run Bitcoin-Qt or bitcoind as a full node.
2. Yeah, but the customer would have to know your IP address and configure it manually, but it wouldn't change anything. If your customer can get to the Bitcoin network, no matter what node, his transaction will be broadcast and verified. 
In mining, I guess if you as a merchant/miner recorded the address of the transaction, you can prioritise his transaction for inclusion into the blockchain. But practically, there is no software that can do this easily, and you would also need quite a lot of hashing power or somehow pay a pool to do it for you, which would in effect be the equivalent of your customer sending the transaction with a higher fee.
edit: As a merchant, you could also have a deal where you 'pay the transaction fee' in the form of a discount or cashback to your customer. Again, no software or POS solution that I know of can do this. Feel free to correct me, anyone.

The red circle icon seems to indicate that the files are not recoverable (unsurprising after a year of general use - most of the files you deleted back then are probably overwritten). I just tried Recuva on my virtual machine, and it seems that some of the files it marks this way, in my case, have some headers containing meaningful information (only a few bytes though).
I'd say recover the files (tick the box on the left and click the "Recover..." at the bottom of the window) and keep them for now. I'm playing around with wallet.dat files to see what's possible.
edit: You could also follow advice (import the wallet and see what happens), but I don't hold high hopes for that idea, because of the red indicator. It's unlikely that the internal database will be fully intact and parsable by the Bitcoin-Qt client. Any recovery is likely to happen through manually looking at the corrupt data, and with more luck.

Proof-of-stake might have other attack vectors.

@_date: 2013-11-11 03:59:04
I agree.
edit: I think that the reason many Christians unfamiliar with it think it might be the Mark of the Beast is because it has no borders - it could become a "world currency". A major feature of the prophesy in Revelation is that there will be only one 'Government' in the world. By all accounts, Bitcoin is more likely to eliminate all governments, rather than unify them.
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:43:05
Because my head shrinks every time I try to think about macroeconomics. :P I've never been in an economics class before, what I know is based on what others tell me and what I bothered to find out myself.
Here's what I think: When lots of people spend Peercoin, the value of each Peercoin increases, and the price of things decreases, incentivising people to spend less and save more. When lots of people save it, the money supply increases, but the value of each coin decreases.
Am I thinking correctly? In this regard, how does Bitcoin not also encourage saving, being a currency in which inflation won't happen and where the value of each Bitcoin is set to increase as its supply is limited?
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:26:13


I think they will really only catch on if there is an action by a government which limits access to the Internet,  or if there's a natural disaster. There are several projects like this, most probably (I forget the German one, there's probably others) but they are mostly separated by which zone of language in the world they were developed in, just like many other open source projects.


Well, one obvious one I can think of is that you could pay for access to the meshnet through Bitcoin. If they aren't all free!
Each unit of bandwidth could be measured precisely and paid precisely and automatically, at competitive rates for each node which can then autonomously pay for its own electricity and upkeep, as well as access to other nodes. An autonomous agent [^1]( [^2]( , owned by itself. 
If a service provider or node allows access in return for Bitcoin, they would need to allow you access to the Bitcoin network in order to pay, though. So, we are likely to see 'free access' prioritised for cryptocurrencies.
edit: I edited it quite a lot, added bits about autonomous agents. The edit markings were too cluttery, didn't include them.

@_date: 2013-11-15 23:12:12
Then it's basically useful only among those random Joes, and worth less. Wherever those coins exist on the network, you or your customers wouldn't be able to use them to trade with large merchants who might jump into the scheme to 'meet regulatory guidelines'. One Bitcoin can't be traded like another Bitcoin - not fungible.
I agree with the idea that it could have happened anyway, under the current structure of the Blockchain. But I disagree that this should be a regulatory or centralised thing, as well as the general concept. I didn't have to do anything illegal, or plan to do so, to be 'butthurt' about this.

I tried it, and calculated that I would never make a return. Feel free to risk a little.
Basically you rent some hashing power from a computer (ASIC) network and take the returns from that. But when I tried it, I calculated that I would not make a return from what I spent because difficulty would keep going up and my returns would diminish.
I also find it a little unethical compared to actual mining because you fund someone else's hashing power, and they get to make political decisions on the network using your funding (some things regarding development of the software needs hashing power to agree with it).
@_date: 2013-10-19 06:31:51
Yeah, this has bugged me in the past - Bitcoin's blockchain is already pretty big compared to most other files I keep around on my computer.
[Bitcoin.it's article on Scalability]( assumes that future nodes will be two-tier. High-end 'processing' nodes to secure the network and do payment processing, and leaf-nodes for transacting.
There are also two links to related work done on this issue, [one by the core dev of Armory]( which deals with the problem by compressing and hashing things into oblivion so that trustlessness can be kept by the leaf nodes. Some processing ("balanced-tree information") is verified by merged-mining on a separate blockchain built for purpose. There's also a different Merkle tree structure required.
The article also links [this paper]( ^[pdf] which it does a well enough job of summarising:

One could also program POS machines so that the customers pay the employees directly, instead of going through the employer's wallet. They can be programmed to divert a certain percentage of all sales transactions to any employee's wallet. That way, all the transactions are coffee-cup sized.
A certain percentage can go to the employer which would use some of his money to even out salaries, since the amount of business received on any given day may fluctuate, but the salaries of the employees need to stay the same in a longer term.

Delay Tolerant Networking is in the works by really clever people like Vint Cerf.
It has use cases in space and here on Earth - you could send emails between remote locations where boats/cars would travel in between and pick up or drop off the emails.

Just had someone in the IRC channel today who mined... ***7500BTC***....
and then threw the hard drive away.
We encouraged him to take a trip to the landfill and see if he could find it, maybe hire someone(s) to help him. He said he's going to make a few calls.
I felt so bad for him. That's $6 million and counting.
edit: He popped back into IRC this morning. He went to the "recycling centre" and they showed him around. The hard drive, if it was there, would be buried under around 4 feet of mud and waste, in an area the size of a soccer field. The cost of closing the centre, hiring diggers, and searching for it would be too high, and then the chances of finding it are still not excellent.
He's based in Newport, in South Wales, United Kingdom.
edit2.1: Also the hard drive was thrown away with the Dell caddy still attached. It came from a 2006 Dell XPS M1710 laptop.
edit2.2: [Newport Waste Management Strategy]( [en] [cym] [.pdf]

About a month ago, I had the idea of 3D printing an arbitrary cube with a QR code on top of the cube. The 3D printing slicer program I use (Cura) has a "pause at Z" plugin, so it's possible to place a paper (handwritten) private key inside this cube in a cavity, and let it carry on printing. That would also be tamper-resistant, and the public address would be visible on top. The private key never passes through a printer's/etcher's memory.
It wouldn't be tamper*proof*, because someone could just retrieve your private key and repeat the process, unless you have something that can't be copied easily, like a pattern of colours in the cube.
When you want to use it, you'd have to saw it open - you could also model a groove for the saw.
Feel free to use and profit from this idea, anyone :)
edit: An alternative to writing it on paper is to (painstakingly) engrave it manually onto a piece of metal. But if you have fireproof safe, there isn't much point to this apart from durability over time, in which case you might as well do it on a piece of plywood.

Watch your power usage, you might be paying more for the power than you are receiving in Bitcoin, especially with the difficulty increasing so rapidly. Price might fall again, but difficulty won't be falling.
If you want security for the wallet you're mining to, you can encrypt it (Bitcoin-Qt has this feature), or set up a paper wallet to send Bitcoins to. 2FA doesn't make sense for a wallet, it's usually used for authenticating on websites over an untrusted or threatening medium (the Internet).

edit: If Bitcoin fails because of its deflationary aspects, and the cryptocurrency model remains valid, it's likely that we'll see an inflationary cryptocurrency.
edit2: I think it's false that debt-burden is reduced over time because of deflation. Maybe in theory. Why would anyone lend money in the current society if 'debt burden is reduced over time', and the value of the money paid back in the future is less than the money lent in the past? If debt burden is reduced over time, there would simply be interest rates to counterbalance it. Presuming lenders are rational and want to make money.

Regarding debt, what do you think happens now? ^edit Almost ^/edit all fiat in existence is *borrowed into existence* meaning someone borrowed that money in order to 'pay off some debt'. Our current economy is debt-based. (edit: The creators and first proponents of Bitcoin saw this as a bad thing.)
Regarding investment loans (to start a business or something), we're very likely to see assurance contracts (Kickstarter) become commonplace, since that can actually be implemented in the Bitcoin protocol.

I've heard it said a few times that if a transaction isn't accepted after a few days, it drops out of the memory pool and your node stops broadcasting it. It's also possible to clear out the transaction after it has been broadcast.
There's also [this prioritisation system]( (see also the little equation at the bottom of the page) which means that transaction priority increases as the transaction's age increases.
All in all, it can probably remain in your hands if you try and broadcast it. If you don't trust yourself to do that, wait for the ability to clump 'dust' together to be implemented.

The old miners wouldn't stop hashing, but depending on the changes (if they are drastic), I think they would continue hashing on a forked chain compared to the new protocol. If they aren't drastic and wouldn't cause a hardfork, they would continue work on the longest chain.
I'm not completely sure of that.
[A hardfork happened before]( because of a bug in an update to the code. The blockchain split into two, and pool operators were quickly consulted to update their pool software, and it was resolved. All transactions from the old chain moved to the longer one.
edit: The linked article would likely inform you more about how the 'voting' works. It's with hashing power, not with sheer numbers (hashocratic? Computing-power-cratic? Not democratic). And it's in the hands of the pool operators, but people can switch pools easily.

No, I bought Bitcoin and never sold them for fiat (edit: except for a bit of day trading here and there on the now-dead Intersango exchange). But if you have verified your identity, most exchanges (Coinbase and Bitstamp, as mentioned by someone else) would transfer fiat quite quickly, and have a good reputation of doing so. Trades happen fast on the exchanges, both ways. Withdrawals and deposits take slightly more time because of banks having to clear things.
There's also Mt. Gox, but I've seen a lot of threads with problems about withdrawal delays.
Lastly, you can sell your Bitcoins directly to a person through a site like [Localbitcoins]( You need to trust the other party, though, and it's also good to build up trust there before trying to trade, since exchanges happen person-to-person. Slightly more dodgy than using an exchange.

What that project tries to do is establish a connection with as many nodes as possible and collect data about them ([see their github repo]( and for that you need port 8333 open to be able to participate in their 'survey'. But you're still participating in the network even if you have 8 connections and your router isn't forwarding port 8333.
edit: They do this by way of asking the known nodes for the IP addresses of more nodes, trying to connect to those, and asking for more addresses, and so on. I don't think nodes which can't be reached by the project are recorded in their database. Also, older protocol versions aren't recorded. User agent is recorded, so I guess they can tell using that if you are using Bitcoin-Qt or some other client. /edit
I have port triggering enabled in my router so that it forwards port 8333 to any computer which is using port 8333 in my house.

Everything we see on an exchange's website is controlled by them. How can we trust exchanges not to fudge the numbers? Initiate panics to increase trade volume and make money from fees?

A lot of features can be added without going to another blockchain or currency. I'm not sure on the technical details, but there is a [hardfork wishlist]( of sorts. Features that will be helpful, but will require a fork in the blockchain - a concerted (probably miner and mining pool driven) effort to move to a new protocol.
There's a major note under "Currency changes" which states: 


Which means that if there need to be economic changes in the currency, an altcoin is in order. But many people here are of the opinion that cryptocurrencies can co-exist and compete perfectly with each other, with government money, and with private money (Amazon or Facebook currency).

With Mt. Gox you'll need to get verified to perform any trades (edit: or deposits or withdrawals), but you can trade quickly after that is done. Typically a trade goes through when the order is fulfilled. Say you are selling 1 BTC for 1000 USD. When someone wants to buy 1 BTC for 1000 USD (whether that be now or in a few weeks), your order is fulfilled.
I don't have much experience with fiat exchanges. Mt. Gox has a lot of complaints about delayed withdrawals and deposits. Coinbase has a small group of users which have difficulties with them (also mainly withdrawing and depositing). Bitstamp has a decent reputation too.
You might also want to consider fees and where they are based. Bitstamp is based in London and uses a Slovenian bank. BTC-e is based in Russia, I think. Mt. Gox is based in Japan but seems to have bank accounts in major countries. Coinbase is based in San Francisco, USA.

Oh, forgot to mention... The private keys are your permission to use those Bitcoins. After you find the file, don't upload it anywhere (edit: without encrypting it first with a key only you know, newer versions of Bitcoin-Qt can do that), because then other people can steal those Bitcoins and any more deposited into the same wallet, forever.
And if you ever get quite a lot of Bitcoins, it is probably wise to look into paper wallets as a security measure (there are some links in this subreddit's sidebar for security). Good luck :)
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:18:13
I don't think there is a competitive advantage. With shorter block intervals, network security is reduced. You'd just have to wait the same time for transactions to confirm (around an hour if you want to be sure).
If we want to change it in Bitcoin, we would need to get all of the miners to agree to that.

If you know how importing private keys work, that's basically how this works.
Under the right-hand side of the paper (folded), there's a private key which allows you to import and spend the contents of the paper wallet. On the left-hand side, visible, you see the public address for the wallet - you can use that to check how much is in the wallet. (edit: And load money onto the wallet.)
It comes with a few weaknesses - you have to trust the person giving you the wallet that they don't keep the private key and steal the money as they walk away. So you can't really use it as cash. Additionally, you have to trust that the private and public keys actually do match up, and you have no way to test that until you scan the private key.
You can generate your own [here]( or [here](
**The private key represents your right to spend the money sent to its respective address.**

If the mining process were to be changed, it would be more difficult. I asked around a few days ago how hard it would be to change from SHA-256 as a hashing algorithm, and the answer was generally 'very hard', because the miners would need to agree to that. Most of them would be slow to sway because they own ASICs designed to mine only SHA-256. Same thing if we wanted to introduce Proof-of-Stake mining (Peercoin and Novacoin do that).
(edit: Changing the block interval would also be very difficult, but not as difficult as changing the hashing algorithm, for the hardware-related reasons I mentioned.)
I also asked how easy it would be to change from ECDSA (the algorithm used to match up private and public keys, and used to sign outgoing transactions), the answer to that was 'much easier'. You'd only need to develop new OP-codes and the surrounding implementation. But I was told that it was 'risky' to implement a different signature algorithm. To my knowledge, no alt-coin does that.
In the end, changes might not need to be implemented in Bitcoin itself. If a cryptocurrency genuinely has merits over Bitcoin, I think that they would outcompete Bitcoin in the market.

1. Yes. No consolidation. You would need a special blockchain parser to see how the money moves around and where it is consolidated.

3. For the *initial download*, it's downloading the entire blockchain, but there are lightweight clients.

Hosting the entire blockchain is advantageous to the network, because your Bitcoin-Qt client acts as a peer for others who are downloading it.

1. If the ~~anarchy~~ chaos ^thanks ^affects network connectivity, Bitcoin usage will probably grind to a halt, but so will everything else that depends on network connectivity. Particularly resourceful people who set up meshnets with ~~trusted~~ other parties (i.e. villages where order is restored, governance or not) would probably try and start it up again, and would probably use it for trade of resources if it's commonplace by then.
2. Ping time to Mars can be up to 40 minutes, longer if the Sun is in the way. You would need some intermediary 'space coin' where the confirmation time is over an hour or two. There does exist [delay-tolerant protocols]( for communication between very-high-latency nodes. Realistically, something like this is likely to be somewhat centralised, while the two currencies are decentralised.
3. What you're saying is correct. Bitcoin Miners would process transactions, add it to new blocks, and make a profit only from transaction fees. Some other cryptocurrencies have an indefinite amount of coins (particularly, Peercoin) with a more or less constant inflation rate (around 1% per year for all users who hold coins).

I wasn't thinking about a multi-part transaction. 
I was thinking, at the point of payment where the request for payment is made, the POS machine can choose to sometimes show the public address of an employee, so that the payment goes directly to them. The customer doesn't really care (if the transaction is standard), they see no difference. The employer doesn't really care, the money would have gone to them anyway. Same with the employee.
*I'm not taking price into account, actually the math in this example is probably terrible and unrealistic. And I'm not doing the "even out" thing either, and assuming that each day's profit is exactly the same.*
Say this coffee establishment has 5 employees, and they make 1 BTC each per day . The establishment sells 10 BTC worth of coffee per day. The employer takes 5 BTC per day in profit.
For each customer that buys a coffee, the POS machine displays a destination address for this payment. The POS machine has 6 choices to make: 5 of the employees' wallets, and 1 of the employer's wallet.
For each address the POS machine displays, the employer decides there should be a 50% chance that it will show any employee's address (10% for each employee because they make equal pay). And there should be a 50% chance that the transaction should go to the employer's profit pot. When a customer comes to pay for their order, the machine doesn't care who they are and doesn't ask them to perform any sort of non-standard transaction, but instead displays the public address of an employee 50% of the time. Each transaction to the employees are coffee-cup-sized. There is one less middleman in the blockchain.
In reality, the employer would need to make an extra pot to even out salaries.

APIs (**Application programming interface**) are usually relevant to developers. APIs let applications talk to each other within a computer or over a network. APIs are most definitely not unique to Bitcoin.
Say you were making a weather app for smartphones, and you wanted raw weather data for the app. The user of the app inputs their location (or it's reported automatically by GPS). Let's say the location is London, UK. 
The app on the user's phone passes the location (usually not precise, just town or city) to the API of a weather service (Yahoo Weather is a common one). The weather service happens to use an RSS interface as an API, so it [requests the data through a URL]( (the location info is the code after the "?w=" in the URL). The service responds with the data in a format which the app can process and manipulate. The app presents this information in a specific way to the user.
Some services (namely Weather Underground in the case of weather reporting services) have restrictions on the usage of their API, to reduce server load or make a profit. In the case of Weather Underground, the developer [pays]( for increased access to the API. The service gives the developer a secret key which is included in the code of the smartphone app. The service identifies the app by this key (whenever a request is made, the key is used), and limits/allows requests accordingly. (edit: Yahoo has [restrictions]( too, but they are more liberal.)
I should say that I've never developed a proper program before, but this is my understanding of APIs.
tl;dr: Applications talk to each other using APIs. APIs define the way(s) applications talk to each other. You probably don't need to set one up if you don't know what it is.

Might be ASICMINER or CEX.io or someone. I'll look into it when blockchain.info comes back up.
edit: I think it's a botnet or a pool connected through Tor~~, except the addresses which Blockchain.info hears these blocks from are never from Tor exit nodes...~~ (^edit3: doesn't need to be exit nodes ^/e ) Nor pool operators. And botnets are uneconomical to operate today, they wouldn't have made so much from people's GPU's.
edit2: All the minting transactions include the data "For Pierce and Paul" ([scroll down to "Coinbase"](
edit3: Using Tor nodes does not always mean that the transactions would go through exit nodes. Tor nodes can also be Clearnet Bitcoin network nodes, that way the transaction would jump across them.

I think that altchains have something different to offer, sometimes.
Freicoin's demurrage rate (edit: ~4.89%) is interesting because it discourages saving/hoarding in favour of spending. Peercoin's special feature is Proof of Stake mining, which uses less energy. Its balancing also means that it ~~has~~ ^edit will have ^/edit a constant 1% or so inflation rate.
Altchains are very much worth watching, at the very least. They may offer strengths where Bitcoin has weaknesses. Bitcoin's replacement may not even be Bitcoin-based, though.
edit: The negative side I've seen is that most people interested in altchains, and most of the hype that goes on [on Bitcointalk]( is people looking for something to invest in, not to trade for goods and services. Their investments are usually worthless in the end, especially for the smallest altchains.

The 'equation' consists of a set of hash functions, so it's difficult to represent. I don't understand it, you would need to go to some cryptography class to truly understand it. Banks trust this stuff, HTTPS is based on this stuff, so it's generally proven.
[Top result from Youtube "How SHA256 works"](


The network determines all the rules, the software running on the nodes can perform the same function using the (now known) nonce and see "oh yeah, that fits. That's allowed." or see "No, you can't do that, you can't have the reward, and ~~this block won't be broadcast past me!~~ I won't broadcast this block!"
edit: Clarified what the node actually does. Also, network difficulty says that a hash must start with a certain amount of zeroes. The more zeroes required, the harder a hash is to produce, naturally.

Yes, Bitcoin-Qt stores the blockchain. For Windows, that's in %APPDATA%\Bitcoin ~~(or .bitcoin?)~~ and on Linux it's in ~/.bitcoin .
The current limit on the growth of the blockchain is ~~1GB~~ 1MB per block, or 52 GB per year, or 7 transactions per second, so nothing to worry about for the moment if you have a medium-level PC.
If you don't want to store and host the whole blockchain, you can use Electrum or Multibit. Electrum works on a partially centralised principle and queries servers which host the full blockchain. I'm not quite sure how Multibit works, but I think it only downloads the latest block.

Thank you for not sticking your heads in the sand over this.
* Why call it Coin Validation if all you are doing is tying addresses to names?
* Why is it being advertised (reported) everywhere as being able to 'sanitize' Bitcoin for businesses by 'tracking clean addresses'? If addresses are only being tied to names, is there really any 'sanitation' going on on your part? This reporting seems to go against the grain of the comment I'm replying to right now. I would like to know which is true and which can be regarded as misleading.
* Why can't this be done in a decentralized manner? Everyone can see the blockchain. Why can't everyone alias the blockchain?
I am unhappy that something like this is being done, but it's inevitable, since everyone can read and interpret the blockchain, given the resources. ^edit Regardless of whether Coin Validation will blacklist or whitelist coins, ^/edit any action to preserve Bitcoin's fungibility needs to happen at the regulators or at the end users (merchants).

 I think they are wrong on that part. Microtransactions will soon be uneconomical on the blockchain.
^edit: I define microtransactions as paying for a sandwich or coffee. Paying for your weekly shop, maybe too, at a stretch. ^/e
Fees will be too high, currently the hard limit is around 7 transactions per second, which is *tiny* compared to current "ecommerce" methods... Microtransactions would need to be performed off-chain through payment processors which use the blockchain as a clearing house.
I think their opinion is uninformed and incorrect.

It isn't hard to set up a securely separated WiFi network for public access. One could also set it up so that only port 8333 is allowed through.
^edit: What would be more difficult is scanning network traffic and making sure that only valid Bitcoin transactions are routed. [A known exploit for pay-walled WiFi networks exists]( where fake DNS queries (containing real data) are sent to a server that acts as a proxy between the DNS protocol and normal IP. If transactions aren't checked, it be even easier to do something similar over port 8333.
^edit2: An easier method if securing the network for Bitcoin-only use is to put a horrendously slow bandwidth limit on it, so that web browsing/general leeching is impractical but Bitcoin transactions still get through (as well as only allowing port 8333 or whatever those other light wallets use). 
On the other hand, this (and limiting ports) might be a bad idea in cases where people use web wallets. Tough one. ^/edits

It would also make it slightly easier to spend.
If you own 10XBT and you put 10XBT into one wallet, if you decide you want to spend 0.5XBT of that on something, you're going to have to load the entire wallet into your computer and then spend what you want to spend, and then send the rest to a new paper wallet. Inconvenient, and less secure.
So it's probably wise to do it in incremental denominations: 1, 2, 4, 8 or however you prefer.

Keep your wallet encrypted in any case. Yes, the threat is that someone will steal your wallet.dat file. (edit2: Read up on cold storage)
Theoretically, if Moore's Law holds true, no password will stand the test of time. If you've been around on the Internet long enough, you would have noticed the increasing demand on making a password 'safe' that is placed on the user. First it was 6 alphanumerics, then it was 8, and then it was 12 alphanumerics with special characters... and now anyone who knows too much would rather opt for a completely random string of &gt;24 characters, unique to each website (edit2: yes, this is unreasonable for humans, but KeyPass exists for that).

As a store of value and medium of exchange, cryptocurrencies are far more exchangeable, assuming access to the Bitcoin network is available to broadcast transactions and query the blockchain, and assuming the recipient can accept it.
As something that is useful, the blockchain model itself can be of some use for storing identity or domain name information (see Namecoin).

Keeping an eye on the comments should already give some context.
From the comments, I can deduce:
1. They discussed the possible threat of government regulation on ASIC chips. Control the mining, control the network. This can be done by way of forcing ASIC equipment to have hardware backdoors, or by making lots of chips for yourself and using them. Effectively, single entity controls majority of hashing. Easy to do, there will only ever be few ASIC-manufacturing companies.
2. They discussed other possible threats, like government co-opting with core developers, and how the current centralization of core developers is a weak point in the system.
3. They were planning to perform a proof-of-concept attack on SPV nodes to show how insecure they are.
4. edit: Oh, and "[Replace-by-fee]( sought by Todd" - basically a method of reversing/replacing transactions before the first confirmation has taken place, by overriding said first transaction with a second transaction of a higher fee. This would discourage people from accepting zero-confirmation transactions, [a highly insecure thing to do]( - a miner or pool with even ten percent of hashing power can reverse such a transaction very easily. I'll continue editing as I find out more things.
5. They considered at several points to publicize ~~their discussion,~~ what they were discussing ~~meaning this leak might be a leak of mutual consent.~~ (see point 7) is in the thread, he doesn't know who did the leak.
6. "Also, p2pool is the only truly decentralized mining option. Not to mention encrypting mining traffic is a very good thing." (thanks 7. JDillon said he is/was high up in the Intelligence Community and regrets what his industry has been doing. He does not want people to know that he was involved with Bitcoin. It's obvious that he was careful about how he communicated with the participants in this conversation. This probably refutes the concept that this was a mutually consensual leak unless he has exited the IC and is now safe from harm, along with any family he might have.

Good, this is what a community discussion is about. Downvoting and moving along isn't the way to carry a discussion forward or develop any new ideas. If people disagree with something, they need to counter sensibly*, not just downvote.
About the confirmation thing, I agree. For practical purposes, it's up to the business to decide how many confirmations need to happen for a transaction to go through. For most small transactions, I think one would be enough.
In general, we need to remember that Bitcoin is the first of its kind. There will probably be unforeseen failures... And there will be fixes which will require a fork or an alt chain (if the next one is blockchain based).

I don't quite understand what's written there, but I can take a guess. It looks like the input of this transaction uses the output of a previous transaction (d1c98d5f573e74be6bd76c9938bc2909fb94141bddf0015555005f029d9bdc4d) which has also not been transmitted onto the network properly. This means that this current transaction is based on something that also doesn't exist, so this one isn't relayed by the network either. (edit: because it's not seen as valid)
If that's true (and I'm really *not* sure if it is), it would mean that it's something only Deepbit's staff can sort out :/ Rebroadcasting the transaction wouldn't work. But still worth a try, as I say, I'm not sure. The source address is supposed to be  [1VayNert3x1KzbpzMGt2qdqrAThiRovi8](

Just had one guy in IRC today who made the mistake of wiping an $8k wallet because he got the drive names mixed up (I won't reveal his name or handle this time).
Then, to reimburse the funds on his computer, he moved $8k to his Electrum wallet. The address he used was copied from Electrum's output in the Terminal window. He thought this was one of his addresses. Electrum doesn't label the addresses it outputs to the terminal.
It was his address, but it was of the wiped wallet. :(
The amount of people finding "lost treasures" are amazing, but the amount of people sending Bitcoins into thin air is depressing.
After he found out what the addresses were I politely told him that he probably should make a paper backup. He said that he didn't want to do that, because paper is 'out in the open'. With a USB copy, he could easily encrypt it with really high strength encryption, make multiple copies, hide them in obscure places, etc...
Luckily, data can be recovered from a USB volume more easily even if it was overwritten, because of the way the controller writes data. So there's a good chance (well, better than most) he'll get his money back.
PS: You really don't need to worry about printers when making a paper wallet. Just write it by hand, it takes 1-5 minutes but doesn't cost you a printer.
edit2: Moral of the story, data that needs to be secret is less volatile on paper.
