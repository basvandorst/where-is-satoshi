How would it struggle? It can handle 8mb blocks currently, 16 or 32 mb will be forked soon and later this year they want to make it dynamic.

How can something with 4$ fees per tx be called a crypto"currency"? BTC is a cryptostoreofvalue.

One channel is for two parties to transact. You will need many more channels than one.

The MEDIAN fee is 4$. So of course some will have less and some more
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:03:27
Many nodes don't relay transactions when fees are too low. This problem exists with the Ledger on BCH too. Under 10sat/byte tx on BCH don't get relayed with a Ledger because the Ledger Nodes reject it because it doesn't work correctly. I can also imagine that the same happened with you, that the node that received your tx had a limit set that was higher than your sat/byte so your txdidn't get relayed.
You should be able to "recover" by importing your private keys into another wallet.

Well of course the tx doesn't exist when nodes dropped it if the fee was too low.

The fuck you talking about? In the last 24 hours 45% of blocks have the BU signal. BU is far from done.

Edit: Nice one taking the quote out of context 


He isn't saying that SegWit transactions are unfairly cheap, but that SegWit transactions are "unfairly" cheap compared to normail bitcoin transaction, of which the price shot into the roof due to full blocks.

You need to trust a node, that's correct.
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:21:38
This thread?


Too large blockchain size is the biggest problem. That why some developers always focus on keeps blockchain as small as possible.
The original chain have to be reliable settlement layer and off-chain have to be fast and cheap payment layer.
Of course you get downvoted for posting wrong information and trying to spin it. There were enough users in the comments correcting you on why not everybody needs the full blockchain.
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:35:17
Where did I disagree with you? I just said that you need to trust a node, which can of course be run by yourself or someone else. Nowhere did I disagree with you that you can't do SPV without running a node yourself and not trusting a third party node.

Show me a source that the EU has freedom of trade.
@_date: 2017-04-18 14:04:16


They cannot be "banned". But the EU can make it impossible to convert it to € on exchanges and make it impossible to pay anything with it, rendering it near useless unless you are a drug dealer selling your shit.

Great usecases. Enjoy having a currency that will be banned in the EU due to that and the energy consumption.
@_date: 2017-04-18 13:41:31
If the EU starts regulating Blockchains and you will not be able to do anything with BTC in the EU other than paying ransom to xXxHackersxXx do you think Bitcoin will stay relevant? And a big part of why the EU is going after Bitcoin is the enormous power consumption due to PoW and the anonymity of Bitcoin.

Yeah but this is about freedom of speech and scamming, which will trump everything else that Onecoin could present.

So no, this doesn't affect BCH much.
