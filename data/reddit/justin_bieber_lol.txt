Just don't forget that it is completely possible to practice something for a while and still be bad at it.

Here is why reading this kind of crap gives me a headache:


One of their researchers and investigators is a man named Tatsuaki Okamoto. When they actively started writing the code they chose the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamura" 
Just one example, we have a fact with accompanying citation juxtaposed with a baseless conjecture, something that almost no one knows for certain. But from the tone of voice the author of the post uses, they seem to suggest that they know both of these things with equal certainty.
Fuck this guy. If he has a real point to make then he shouldn't need to blatantly deceive people like that.

Ahh... I understand now. "whoosh," as they like to say on here.

I don't know what the experts have to say, but I am pretty sure that in the absence of a common currency, people usually revert to bartering with/for things that they actually need.

They also killed and raped and ate each other all the time, but yeah I guess you could move around anywhere you wanted to.

Honest question, are you actually basing this on any tenable logic, or just that you have a hard time wrapping your head around it? 
Because every time it goes up in value, it seems even crazier that a digital coin with no intrinsic value would be worth so much actual money. But at the same time, why is there an upper limit to how much value one bitcoin could be regarded as having?

You need to decide ahead of time what you're getting into this for.
Whether you are investing or day-trading, there is an outside chance for you to lose ALL your money, but how you're risking that is something you have control over. You either put it aside, and hope that bitcoin gains value but know that it might plummet, or you put in an amount that you know you are gambling with by trading, and that you might lose through bad deals.
If you can't decide what you want out of this and make impulse decisions based on what the price is doing at the moment, you're probably gonna screw yourself.

Maybe you meant IBM or Google? Email is not a company.

While I don't know a whole lot about cryptography, I understand that the idea behind bitcoin is perfectly sound and the widespread use of it is probably inevitable. But that doesn't mean it couldn't turn out to be an idea ahead of it's time, or that the value ultimately stabilizes beneath what it is at this exact moment.

What the author completely ignores is that there are ways for merchants to essentially trade their bitcoins back in for USD immediately upon purchase, if they so desire.
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:18:42
Oh my god, what if some villain kidnaps a bunch of computer hacking prodigies from MIT and forces them to hack the FBI and steal all the bitcoins? It's gonna be like a movie.

Investing in bitcoin and never spending it is a bit like investing in a business and then making it a point never to shop there.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:30:54


haha what
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:31:43
A sociopath would probably have been more calm about it.
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:25:40


Haha, you don't say..

While we're on the subject I would also like to know what *any* of this has to do with string theory or curing cancer.

Yes, seriously. Reading r/bitcoin honestly scares me a little bit because having been here a couple weeks, I'm starting to notice some of the circle-jerkiness. I've invested conservatively so far, but I worry I might be deluding myself a bit because it seems like here we're only exposed to the good news and none of the bad. It could be because there's no bad news to report, or because it's just not being talked about, and a lot of us have no way of knowing.
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:09:47
Haha, yeah, but wait when did you say it would be
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:55:28
I was thinking the villain would be Nicholas Cage, one of the hackers would be DJ Qualls (the kid who does all the computer stuff in "The Core") and it would basically be similar to Swordfish except with different people because obviously this is real life we're talking about here and not the movie.

So buy the things that you can, and use cash for the other stuff. Don't worry I had to sit here and think about that one for a while myself.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:43:16


I don't disagree with the bulk of your post but that statement right there was some downright silliness. You realize that things have to be created before they can have a continued existence, right?
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:38:59
The best part of reddit is logging on and seeing that a bunch of people were arguing over some ambiguous comment you wrote without even really thinking about.
