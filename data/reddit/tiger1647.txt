Here I sit broken hearted.  Tried to sh but only farted.

Red, are you able to tell how many people actually setup lighting and are able to withdraw your tips?  Just curious how successful your tipping spree has been.

I’m not your friend, mate

When they printed it was probably worth 500

It was just a joke...

With the cash app, I get you can buy bitcoin.  But once you buy it, can you easily send to a wallet?  I don’t see that option but maybe that is because I also did not link it to a debit card yet.

I don’t think that’s true if you buy something.   You would want to check with your local cpa.   Depends on your country.

Clearly bitcoin has value, it is currently worth 10,782.  So what’s the flaw in your theory?

I have high high hopes for a living.

It means 6 different entities / nodes (not sure right terminology) will confirm that your transaction was valid before it “posts” but don’t worry - you have locked in whatever you traded at.

I hope to god you kept a copy of that yourself.
@_date: 2019-04-12 02:22:25
I did the same.  I realize it’s a premium, but I used Roth IRA money I could not otherwise tap

Can it work in reverse if I have a PayPal balance I want to send to coinbase?

256 and I’ll relax a bit

The moon is AFTER 10 million?

I have some in my ira.   You pay a premium, but theoretically the premium is there when you sell too.   I had to click that I understood it was a volatile asset or something like that when I bought it, but otherwise no Hassel

But why pick the Fed, that is a USA centric view when crypto is global
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:06:26
Thanks.  I’m a noob
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:38:30
Why not?  I’ll pick a penny off the street.

Only if you are consistently buying a set amount each week/month and you are investing what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2019-05-29 02:07:51
I personally think yes, the price will increase from here, significantly, over the next 24 months.  But no one knows for sure, hence the second key part of the only what you can afford to lose piece.
