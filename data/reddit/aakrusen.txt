No, how yellow is the urine?

Tried to move some BTG on Tuesday (Jan 2nd), still waiting for the confirmation.

As long as it doesn’t stink.

The end of the gif is the best part.

Shouldn’t Cold Storage be taking your private keys offline and putting them on paper or a hardware wallet.  I may be wrong, but doesn’t all Crypto stay on the Ledger, but the control over our Crypto is what we’re putting in Cold Storage?

Why does the date keep getting pushed back?  I thought it was originaly Dec 2, then Dec 10, now Dec 18.  Or has it always been Dec 18th?

12.5 bitcoins is not good enough?  I know that’s not what you were thinking of, but that’s a good enough reward for me.

Right, because of his history and narcissism, it would make a PLOT TWIST in that it's the opposite of what we're expecting.
@_date: 2018-05-10 13:00:52
Plot twist, this was Roger Ver the whole time.
@_date: 2018-05-10 13:54:59
You’re right about the plausibility part, but since Roger lives in fantasy land anyway, we can stick with fiction for this one.

Had to shave your head too?

There is an interview the Winklevoss Twins did back in 2011 (don't recall the year) and they made a claim that at that time the projected market cap of Bitcoin when it plains out will be about $400 billion.

Until they become numb, then rub one out.

Less than a year ago it was below $1000 and the miners were doing just fine. If electrical costs would have doubled or tripled in the last year, then I’d see you concern. Electrical costs haven’t really done much of anything during this 9 year run for Bitcoin, so Bitcoin could go even cheaper and the miners could survive.

Well, the last few hours must have been exciting for your penis. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:47:58
I think it reached $7440 on Gdax.

Works great when you’re shorting bitcoin.

When you zoom out on your buy/sell order graph, of course it's going to look like that.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:03:30
There are dozens of us, dozens. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:06:18
Right, that graph should read Crypto-currency Market Cap, not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:00:33
Winklevi said only $400 billion. I guess we’ll be stuck with less than 1/2 billion.

A little optomistic, but you’re not far off. If this house maintained that selling price all the way to point where BTC levels off, my guess is it would be about 10-20 BTC for this place. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:21:25
So he did spend 10k BTC, but it was for two pizzas?  Got it!
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:12:18
Wouldn’t that be 1/2 of a pizza?  I thought the guy paid 10k BTC for the pizza?
