As someone who doesn't trade in bitcoins, can someone give us a brief rundown on what happened? 
Edit: for anyone looking 
Wow, it sounds like a lot of you got screwed because of this :(

It reminded me of a slightly more democratic version of pivitoltracker.

Some software does. MD5 on user end, salt + md5 on backend.

You mean development on Reddit itself? That would be amazing!

Thanks for this, this sounds like a brilliant idea to me.
I develop a Reddit client with my friend ( We're both students who didn't know much about the open source community when we started, but I think it would be beautiful to take our client open source with a completely democratic system like this one for determining which features developers work on. Imagine a version of Reddit where **everything** is transparent. Not just content that gets posted here, but literally all development ideas, and directions that the website goes in.

Go through this thread and write down everyone who said they're a developer interested in helping you out (myself included). Then you should send us all a private message describing more specifically what you want, along with the info for an IRC channel that you will make, and/or a subreddit you make specific to this project.
We will regroup there and discuss the game plan, with you there to help us along with Q &amp; A. After discussion we'll have a manifesto of what needs to be done and we can begin working on it with as minimalistic of a hierarchy as possible to oversee the repository. If you want progress you need to do this so that we have a medium to discuss what's necessary to develop to guarantee a free and open future for the bitcoin community.
Do this, and keep your $100k. Give every contributor to the project a single vote in deciding which charity the money goes to on behalf of the bitcoin community. Let our day jobs pay us for proprietary software creation, and we will contribute to this project because it's fun, and because bitcoin and Internet freedom is a good cause. Also, because $100,000 USD to a charity is a phenomenal pledge that developers can all make a reality.
