[Mycelium HD is out!](
HD wallets instead use a “master seed” (a single large random number), to derive all future bitcoin addresses sequentially from that single seed. This means that you only need to make a backup once, and all the keys generated by an HD wallet can be restored at any time in the future just from that single master seed.

Prices going down means you get more for the same value, reaping the benefits of technological improvement to society. Should that $25k house cost you $50k next year? Debt based society or asset based? 
Technology like 3D House printing brings the cost down significantly. Individual markets are always being improved and replaced.
Think about being poor. If prices are coming down it is much easier to get back on your feet. If prices are rising and rising you need more and more just to stay even. 
Should investors benefit off a productive society or should savers benefit from a productive society?
Inflationary currency causes a problem when prices dip below the value of the smallest currency. How do I sell things for less than a penny?
It breaks down to opinion. Central planning to keep stable prices (currency adjusting for wealth and population) or decentralized stable currency (price adjusting for wealth and population). Both arguments can be valid to a degree.

If I want to send $100, I can buy 10 x $10/each, 1 @ $100, or .5btc @ $200. You only lose if you buy and sell lower. Most people do both USE and Re-buy, and hold. 
Some people don't have enough money so they USE and it gets put back up for sale. That along with 10% inflation drives prices down. When bitcoin goes from 25 reward btc to 12.5 we will see a more stable price, along with increases, as we did last time. Why? Even if we didn't have adoption, the same people going after a smaller pool. There are more people now but not 10% + sales.
I don't own an Oculus YET. There is money to be made in VR. I intend to purchase one. I will have to get a new computer as well. (Will purchase with bitcoin) You might as well be in the VR forums saying VR will never happen because the Oculus is available but no one is using it. The price of Oculus will have an effect on who buys one.
Sure blockchain technology is very different from Facebook's Oculus Rift. But there is an adoption curve that trends with the technology curve. 
There are people waiting on the sidelines to buy if it goes low enough. There are people who want to see it successful before they buy. There are people who just want to use it to order things online because they don't have a credit or debit card. You can not see the sidelines and who it waiting there. Electric cars, smart phones, 4K TV, etc... all of these have the same issues.
Do I raise an eyebrow when the price drops? Sure I'm human, but it doesn't get much of a second thought. But you 'kids' have no patients. You have never given a good reason for instant growth.
I am slowly changing my spending habits. Credit? Don't use it. Banking/Debit? Buying bitcoin + bills that can't be paid with bitcoin (yet). Spending is going to bitcoin and cash.
If it all fails? I guess I can just go back to cash right? Sure I lose what I put in, but I already knew that was possible.

I've been trying to massively concentrate bitcoin. It is difficult.
Not everyone can hold as value rises. Value rises when the worlds pie gets bigger. Things people are willing to pay for. Do we need enough currency units to match what is being traded in the market? Functional Divisibility. You can increase total currency or price/value. It's the same equation, except the increase is done by authority in one case, and market forces decide the price/value in the other.
~~The pie can get bigger. We are not cutting up a single pie. Pie is the unit of currency. Right now the world uses 1 pie, and adjusts the infinite thickness of the knife for each slice. If we inflate the currency we have no idea how much pie we have. If we use a fixed currency we can tell there is more pie in the world when we can buy more pie with the same amount.~~
I think a better example is Metrology. Scientific equipment standards. Why do we agree a gallon is a gallon. We need a specific reference point. If all currency is a floating point standard instead of a fixed point, the ability to calibrate is lost. We need a peg that is able to scale.

Yeah I didn't want to work hard. ;) 
I think you got it. 
I just came up with this:
Having trouble explaining Bitcoin? Blockchain Clearing House (BCH) - 10 Minute average account settlements.
Have you ever made a deposit into a bank, then checked your account to see if the funds were available only to find the transaction PENDING for multiple days?
Bitcoin is the currency of a peer to peer blockchain clearing house. Instead of your bank shutting down your access to your account every night so it can sort out who-spent-what, the blockchain mining process does this every 10 minutes (on average) without shutting down, worldwide. Anyone can join and use the currency or the mining process. 
^*Mining ^will ^not ^be ^valuable ^without ^significant ^investment.
This is what Bitcoin is. Simple.
@_date: 2014-10-31 04:19:06
The blockchain is the actual file everyone is sharing. The miners update the file every time you make a transaction. You initiate the movement of your bitcoin, the miner sees and records it to the file. The file must be agreed on by all miners. The miner gets new bitcoin for keeping the file up to date faster than everyone else mining. (kind of)
The wallets and keys are just really really big numbers. They are generated randomly with a one way function. A one way function is a bunch of math that you can not work backwards from. Take the function A + B = C, if you only have information about C you can't determine A or B. If I give you the number 64, which 2 (or more) numbers did I use to get to the number 64? Was it 8 x 8? Was it 1 + 63? 
You use cryptography to mix your large wallet number up so that only C is public. Only you know A + B and can then move the coins along.

No, four CHOSEN words is not a lot.  
Four RANDOM words is better but not secure.
  
12 RANDOM words is currently secure.
  
Chosen words are not random words.
Below taken from [Bitcointalk.org](
The seed is a 128 bits random number, generated by os.urandom()
The seed is represented as a sequence of words in order to facilitate memorization and storage, but it can as well be represented as a hexadecimal string, or as a number.
For some reason, people tend to perceive words as "less random" than numbers. That's an illusion. 
The only thing that actually matters is the number of bits of entropy in your seed (128 bits is considered as very safe, and will probably remain safe until real quantum computers are invented), and the quality of your source of randomness (electrum does not use python's random module)
Again: Choosing words is not random. You must verify/calculate entropy to see.

Blood in streets? Must be time to buy. FUD FUD FUD. Thanks for my indicator signal.
I don't think a recovery will happen. All the good news is apparently pushing the price of Virtual Reality  downwards. We'll be sub $300 soon, and then it will go sub $200, and sub $100.
Yeah, tell me how stupid I am etc. but the majority (80%+) of this community didn't expect Virtual reality to drop below $900 when it was at $1200. I don't have to tell you that you were wrong (it's obvious).
Companies like Facebook buying tens of millions ($) worth of Virtual reality says nothing. They, too, is taking a gamble.
Remember the cirkle jerk when Facebook announced his support for Oculus? Everyone was talking about his project (virtual space travel) and how it accepted Bitcoin payments. We would all go to the moon with their virtual space-plane. Well, a few days ago one of those space-planes crashed during a test (the pilot died).
You can buy all the way down if you want, but it'll be a waste of your money.
I mean, almost all of the Virtual Reality businesses have failed so far.
Those companies were only established because of Virtual Reality price surge. Investments will decrease, companies WILL go bust (and many already have) and Virtual Reality will die. Some people made a lot of money, but most people got rekt.
Please don't place stupid ''don't invest more than you can afford to lose'' BS comments. We all know the majority doesn't follow that rule. Most people were hypnotized by the promises made by this community (''moon, smell-o-vision, virtual sex in 1 year, etc.''), so you can't blame them for pulling the trigger and spending extra money; everyone wants to make money fast.
Conclusion: Experiment has failed, but most people simply don't realize it yet.
I predict sub $200 Oculus by February 2016.

Holds bitcoingruvan in Boden key to an idealistic future, or one of the biggest scams? DN view the digital currency's entry in Norrbotten.
It's 45 degrees in the helicopter hangar in Boden. The large doors open out to the parking lot and the old empty airfield, now overgrown with grass and shrubbery. Fans are mounted on the roof and in the aisles, but we sweat when we go along endless rows of storage shelves in metal where processors are neatly lined up and produce heat. It's August, and here in the hangar, the company KNC Miner during the first eight months of 2014 created the equivalent of 200 million out of nothing. Or, rather, electricity and enormous processing power.
Just beside the hangar is another big room where Avtar Singh and his five colleagues, leased from a company in Stockholm, installing new custom built computers, miners. Five of them are originally from India, one from Peru. Right now flowing Indian music from the speakers.
- But occasionally we run a Peruvian song to be fair, says Avtar Singh and laughs.
Avtar Singh and his colleagues are here temporarily to mount, but usually works 25 people full time in bitcoingruvan in Boden. Guards, technicians and site manager Michael Zachrisson who worked here since May.
- I knew nothing about bitcoin from the beginning, but I've learned a lot, says Michael Zachrisson.
What currency do you get your salary?
- I am quite pleased to get it in Swedish kronor.
The hangar we are in has previously belonged to the Armed Forces helicopter school. In recent years it has been used as a warehouse.
- My neighbor had his boat standing here for a while, says Michael Zachrisson.
Now it's more life. It's fast decisions into action.
- You can improvise sometimes. I have been forced to Clas Ohlson and buy hubs. I think they had nine. It was not enough so far.
What is happening here, in the long hyllraderna in bitcoingruvan in Boden, is not easy to understand. And it is also not without controversy - in the months following the visit of Constance will now KNC Miner be strongly criticized.
The story of bitcoin begins in 2008. Then came a document up on the internet, signed Satoshi Nakamoto, who in detail described how to technically could create a so-called crypto-currency - a complete economic system built on digital money. The following year released the same mysterious signature on the first bitcoinprogramvaran, and the very first bitcoinen was conceived.
Who Satoshi Nakamoto is, nobody knows. Many have speculated: is it a solitary genius, a group, a secret government conspiracy? Exactly why Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin is also impossible to know. But there are many interesting aspects of crypto currencies - both practical and ideological. You can use bitcoin in much the same way as ordinary money: buy things for them, transfer them between accounts, invest in them. But while ordinary currencies central controlled in one way or another - national banks decide over inflation and deflation, and transfers go through credit card companies, banks or companies like Paypal - this is a crypto-currency totally unguided.
- The first thing I always say is that one must learn to think differently: it is a "person-to-person" -valuta, says Robin Teigland, who is an associate professor at the Stockholm School of Economics and researches crypto currencies.
When I asked her to explain bitcoin as easy as possible she laughs a little Supplied before she attempts to unravel the hard grip only in a fully digital economy.
- It can be difficult for people to understand that bitcoin is not associated with any government or central bank. There are no third party, there's only network, says Robin Teigland.
The network is the most important thing to grasp if one wants to understand bitcoin. Anyone who owns bitcoin need a special software, a bitcoinplånbok. All wallets worldwide are connected to a large network, and each time bitcoin change ownership information is sent out to everyone on the network. The network gathers regularly together the latest transactions in a group, a "block". Each block formed refers back to the previous block, in a long chain. Block chain thus contains all information about all bitcointransaktioner ever performed.
It is here bitcoingruvan in Boden comes into the picture. All processors on the hyllraderna in the hangar working to try to create new blocks to the chain. Each time the network has gathered a bunch of new transactions - every ten minutes - launched a kind of contest, where all the bitcoinnätverket can participate. Simplified one can say that the contest is to solve a deliberately difficult problem that requires a lot of computing power. Anyone who has time to first create the new block, and get a reward. The reward consists of bitcoin, and it is the only way to create new bitcoin. This is what is known as mining or mining - a metaphor for digging in a mine, where computing power is the excavators and bitcoinbelöningen is gold.

Electricity is pretty close already. There are privacy implications to constantly monitored electricity/water usage as well.  Water is probably measured more carefully in places with limited access. If I were a guest in your home, would I have to pay to turn the light on and flush the toilet? Why should payments be instant, vs 10 min, vs monthly? Why is paying instantly more useful to me? In our society access to a bathroom has always pushed toward the 'free' side. I would gladly let someone use my bathroom so I don't have to clean up after them on my porch.

In Bitcoins childhood was possible to make a killing using his home computer. But gradually, the competition among mining breakers increased. Nowadays, you need specialized equipment. Some go together in groups to increase the chances to catch the first blocks and receive a share of the reward. And KNC Miner has all this business idea: selling gruvbrytarutrustning, and one mining violates the very large scale in the hangar in Boden.
The mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto has withdrawn himself, and the pursuit of a person or group identity continues. The alias is believed to be about a million bitcoin - at most, they have been worth about 8 billion Swedish crowns, today they are worth around 2 billion - but Bitcoins creator has no power over the network or currency. The system is structured in a way that no decision on the currency can have any effect without a majority of the users themselves go with them.
- And there is a transparent system, all transactions are recorded in the public logbook, says Robin Teigland.
In practice, a system bitcoin several advantages compared to a regular value. In an increasingly globalized economy there is a need to be able to make small, simple, safe and affordable payments over the world, says Robin Teigland.
- With traditional currencies are micropayments, for example, difficult to do. It's hard for me to send money to another part of the world without the cost and delay. In many parts of the world, people have no access to bank accounts, and also there is a problem to solve.
Whether right bitcoin is the answer remains to be seen, says Robin Teigland.
- There are other solutions than bitcoin on the problems, and there are other crypto currencies. Many argue that perhaps we will land on three or four different crypto currencies eventually.
is the currency abbreviation of bitcoin
The most interesting aspect of bitcoin is not the currency itself. It is most bitcoinentusiaster agree. The revolutionary is the technology behind, block chains that enables secure transactions of data, but there is no parent control body - not a government agency, government or bank that registers and keeps order. It may not sound so spectacular, but some visionaries believe the technology could eventually change the Internet basically - perhaps even the whole society.
British Daily Telegraph, published in June, an article in which the newspaper's technology editor Matthew Sparkes called bitcoin for "gateway to an upcoming Digital Anarchy" and painted a possible future with driverless taxis on the streets and a sky full of stray drones who supply goods. A science fiction dystopia, or -utopi, depending on how you look at it.
Sparkes vision is sharp and exaggerated, but not wholly unfounded. Blockkedjetekniken actually has some revolutionary potential. A block chain requires not only contain information about bitcoin, but can accommodate all kinds of data. Who owns a car, who controls a domain name online, who is entitled to vote in an election - information that can be secured and recorded by the network itself, without official interference. Even now going different types of non-monetary data transactions free ride on bitcoinkedjan or similar blocks chains, and in the future there could be even more. In an article on bitcoinsajten Coindesk explains, for example, the artist DA Wallach how blockkedjetekniken could revolutionize the music industry, by acting as a single, central and open database of who has rights to the music.
It would theoretically be able to move the entire music industry's economy to a crypto-currency system. Each song, artist and author could have its own bitcoinplånbok. Each time the song is played on Spotify, for example, a micro-payment to the song's wallet, then the system automatically split the sum of all the authors who are connected to the song. Quickly, automatically and without any expensive and large administration system.
Bitcoinrörelsen is very much influenced by ideology, or perhaps ideologies. Blockkedjetekniken is a libertarian wet dream, an internet anarchist utopia. The built decentralized democratic system is attractive for many. And the question of whether a bitcoinekonomi is compatible with a socialist society is debated on the Internet - Bitcoin is at least one possible way to demolish the existing capitalist system, if only to replace it with a new one.
Cliché of whom a bitcoinanvändare is does appear to be quite true: He is on average 32.1 years old libertarian party, according to a study conducted at University College London. When the US newspaper Huffington Post wrote about the study in February last year, shortly after the exchange rate temporarily crashed into the ground, he made headline: "Bitcoin is apparently a rich, white, male disaster". But Lui Smyth, who is behind the study, developed his ideas in a long blog post shortly thereafter, and pointed out then that it is much more than just libertarianism behind the movement. It reflects a deep skepticism towards banks and stock exchanges, it was born in the wake of a major economic crisis and is based on a more general distrust of the current economic order. In the years since Bitcoins birth, the number googlingar the phrase "what is money?" Doubled.
Some who thought a lot about Bitcoins influence of ideology and activism is the artist group Mediengruppe BITNIK. On November 14, delivered the Swiss postal service a padded white envelope Kunsthalle St. Gallen in Switzerland. Inside the envelope was a DVD case with a small square foil vacuum packing, and the film was a plastic bag with ten yellow ecstasy tablets. They are now part of Mediengruppe Bitniks artwork "Random darknet shopper (2014)". The art gallery in Sankt Gallen was in fact the whole winter a robot and bought random goods on the Internet underground world, "darknet" or "the 'deep web'.

It's great to ask!
I get that you want to understand, but everyone is going to give you  a 'scenario' instead of you actually doing the math and understanding it. This will be a problem until you try to understand it, if that is what you are looking for. Watch the videos, look up the terms you don't know. Figure out the math. Understanding these MASSIVE numbers is interesting stuff.
What kind of answer do you think would satisfy your 'wanting to understand it' without 'actually understanding it'?
For a scenario, its like going to Vegas and winning all of the value on earth. It's not going to happen, even if it could in some weird way. (Note: This is excluding programmer/software error. The math is correct, based on current technology and future technological progression.)


The possibility of anything (think unicorns) is &gt;0% without knowing the possibility (reality) of everything. Some other planet may have an animal you would classify as a unicorn. Silly, but when talking possibility, it's all about the unknown leaving a little bit of chance. You finding that planet, with that unicorn? The possibility would be greater than 0 right? but still so small it really doesn't matter.


I hesitate to answer these questions. You can burn a dollar bill, is that a potential flaw? Airplanes can run out of fuel. etc etc. At some point things work how they do and you adapt around them knowing their flaws.


If you think about it, you would need a list of all the addresses or random numbers used. You could spend all the time in the universe generating addresses let alone keeping and sorting through such a list. Part of the point of the security of the keys is that it takes time to do these things. Also the key needs to be private, so such a list would be a central fail point. 
Using randomness to get the number in the first place is the same 'system preventing the generation of the same private keys'. It has been incorporated. There is no known other way to make sure without compromising security.


No one said 100%, and if they did they lied. This only happens in special cases where the random function isn't really random. Unbalanced coins or loaded dice could give you non-random addresses. If someone figured out how to reverse [P vs NP]( there would be issues.
There is a joke about staying safe when you fly by bringing something with you. Things that go boom. Chances there are two on a plane is smaller than the chances there is one, so if you control it you are safe. 
Just by asking if it is likely to get a collision, just about rules you out of being the one who it happens to. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 14:55:42
I knew I should have stated that differently.
The minute number of addresses that will ever be used is so small compared to the total number of fixed keys that there is effectively zero chance of a collision. I think it's that video that uses the drawer demonstration. You and another person will never be able to choose the same drawer (if your random number generator works), or unless you try well known boxes like the first or last, or all the ones on the edge. The number of addresses is TINY and always will be compared to the total number.

Okay I think I see the problem. You think more efficiency is tied to less quantity. The world needs abundance my friend. We can be environmentally friendly and use more.
We want more power, more efficiently, at a cheaper cost. Solar or hydrogen or fusion, whatever works and gives us the best efficiency so we can use the shit out of it. A fully transforming home would take a lot of power to run. I want lots of electricity cheaply, not little bits cheaply. Christmas lights on year round. Robots charging. Drones on the roof. Use lots of power! Same with water. If it water was used efficiently we wouldn't need much of it. Every house could have its own purification system. People could take continuous clean hot water showers at very little to no cost. I want everyone to be able to do that. Do more with the same. Use as much as you want efficiently, not use less. We want plants that grow food right when we need it, meat in a test tube, etc. Everywhere you look BULK costs less than individual packaged things.
Meters already exist that can transmit usage information to the power station. They are used currently in industrial bushiness mostly. The blockchain has nothing to do with power meters and their accuracy. You said the meters are inaccurate. While some of the older ones are, you still need a meter to feed the blockchain the smart contract and the usage information. How does using the blockchain fix the meter? That's not how it works.

- This area around the airfield there were not a few years ago. We still live in the belief that a company must have thousands of employees to be something to talk about, but it does not work so now. I think KNC is a great addition to the local authority. It gives a lot.
All is not gold and green forests in bitcoinbranschen. In the months after our visit to Constance piling up complaints against KNC Miner. In addition to running his own bitcoingruva, so they sell also mining equipment, computers specially designed for people to be able to dig for gold at home. And customers are dissatisfied: they mean that deliveries of two of mineralization models have been slow. KNC Miner has not agreed to repurchase. In early February, goes around fifty people together for a class action submitted to the district court, which calls for SEK 10.5 million of KNC Miner. Moreover, a further 15 individual lawsuits against KNC Miner submitted by Joakim Strignert on Juristfirma your right.
- The KNC has done is to sell expensive machines for mining of crypto-currencies online, it has paid in advance and promised a specific delivery date. Since it has not been able to deliver on the date, says Joakim Strignert.
According to Joakim Strignert argue customers that machines are not performing as promised, are flammable and does not meet the security requirements for electronics, such as CE marking.
- You deny individuals their consumer rights. It refuses to accept the repurchase or sending money back. These are up to 70 000 per machine, some have bought two or three, maybe borrow to afford.
The case is complicated in that it involves just a crypto-currency. Delay in the delivery means not only that customers have to wait - Weekly machine can not be used also means a potential loss of income in bitcoin. And according to Joakim Strignert says most of his clients to KNC Miner deliberately deceived them.
- The incentive to create great products and deliver on time is low when at the same time competing with their customers. It takes in advances from customers, produces chips, but instead of sending the equipment goes chips into their own computer center. You have cheated the customers with unrealistic delivery date, taking into interest-free credit and let customers pay for a new mega data centers. What we see here might be one of the biggest scams, says Joakim Strignert.
KNC Miner itself does not agree Strignerts description. In a written statement from the KNC's legal department says it:
"We have not built anything 'for clients' money'. Different parts of the KNC Group is engaged in various kinds of activities, which are financed on a commercial basis, with both venture capital surplus from its own operations. "
As regards the delivery of products, you write:
"Our customers want, like us, stay in the forefront of this development. Order often occurs when a product just is fully developed and before the entire production process can be surveyed, therefore we are careful to explain that the delivery date is uncertain. Our view is that we kept our promises. "
And concerning the equipment would not meet safety, writes KNC that it's about customers who have used Peripheral fault the quality or capacity.
Perhaps Bitcoins very nature - there are so many aspects of and driving forces behind the currency, ideology and capital confused - one reason why there are conflicts in the Great bitcoingruvbrytarföretagen.
- It's really a lot of talk and high noises on the forums on the web on this subject, says Nanok Bie is "futurist" on KNC Miner, which means that he works with market analysis and product development
- But if you read what Satoshi Nakamoto wrote, it is very clear that he predicted exactly this: first comes home computers to mine, then specialized hardware, then great facilities. This is Satoshi Nakamotos own future plan, it harmonizes with his original idea. There is a misconception that kryptovalutorna would be driven by idealism, but the system needs a lot of power to operate.
Basically involves lawsuits about money, says Nanok Bie.
- People want money. We sell machines that make money. Everyone wants money, what are they otherwise for motivation? And they will do almost anything to get money.
There one can apply on KNC Miner well.
- It is a commercial industry. What should we do, shut down the company? Clearly you work for success. And we do not drown in money it costs to build it here, says Nanok Bie.
The little art project in the Kunsthalle St. Gallen has not ended happily. When the exhibition closed on January 11 came Swiss police and seized robot acted ecstasy of bitcoin on the Darknet, as well as goods. The artists behind the work writes in a statement on his website: "What does it mean for a society when there are robots acting autonomously? Who is responsible when a robot breaks the law on their own initiative? "Whether someone will be prosecuted for drug purchase is not yet clear. But the questions Art Group sets are relevant, and crypto-currencies is part of the reason why they are so difficult to answer. Whose money is it that bought ecstasy? Can you determine the ownership of a bitcoinplånbok, if there is a robot that handles it?
In some countries, crypto-currencies banned completely, including Iceland and Vietnam. In China, for example, it is prohibited for financial institutions and banks to deal with the crypto-currencies. But elsewhere, bitcoin is being established at the usual regulated financial market. In January, bitcoinföretaget Coinbase America's first licensed bitcoinbörs, with support from the New York Stock Exchange. The company Gemini has also drawn in once what it calls a "totally controlled" bitcoinbörs in New York.
Sam Cole, who is president of KNC Miner supports the development and believe that bitcoinvalutan will stabilize as a result of the new regulated exchanges. The current low rate may be because people are waiting for safe and sustainable exchange services to use, after crashes Mt Gox disaster.
- Some customers do not trust the options available, and it does not help that the sites have had security holes. With the regulated stock markets, we believe that the course will stabilize and perhaps increase, says Sam Cole.
Anarchists currency may therefore require some regulation to work and become stable. But how much a part of society and the existing economic system can kryptovalutorna be, without also losing all his points? It is contradictory, just like most things related to bitcoin.
How it goes for the empty airplane hangar area in Boden, and with the municipality's confidence in the data center and bitcoingruvor, is uncertain. The grass and slyet on the airfield perhaps may continue to sway desolate. KNC Miner looking at alternatives in Finland. Where electricity is cheaper, and if Sweden does not lower the tax on energy for data centers so is considering moving the entire operation across the border. It takes a lot of power to create money out of nothing.
How Bitcoins:
Anyone using bitcoin must have a bitcoinplånbok, a special software to their computer or mobile phone. All wallets are paired in a large network.
When a transaction is carried out - bitcoin changes hands - the information is sent out to the network. The latest transactions are grouped together in a block.
Everyone who is on the network can, if they wish, choose to act as "miners" miners. This means that the grant computing power to perform calculations for the network.
To block transactions to be verified, have a mineral find the right solution to a problem. Simply put, it's about finding a series of numbers that match the block. All the miners who are on the network starts to work on solving the problem.
When the problem is resolved verified the block. Each block contains information about the previous block, and they together form a long chain. It becomes a public cash book of all transactions ever made in bitcoinsystemet. A new block formed roughly every ten minutes.
The miner who has time to first find the solution, get a reward in the form of new bitcoin. It is the only way to create new bitcoin system. Right now, the reward is 25 bitcoin, but the sum will decrease gradually and eventually become zero, and instead replaced by voluntary transaction fees.

The robot got a veckolig budget of bitcoin. What it bought had no control over, not even the artists themselves. Among the other goods which have been delivered to the gallery are a couple of Nike shoes, a spy camera mounted in a black cap, a credit card ("ALL MY CARDS ARE FRESH, NOT SOLD Twice"), a DVD box with all the "Lord of the Rings "movies and a bunch of keys that were promised to be from the fire department and have main keys to a number of public stores and locations.

It is interesting when money stops being in the hands of states and governments and becomes something that people can create, and there have been many utopian projects around the artists and activists. Bitcoin has the potential to show that money is not an absolute, and I think that bitcoin already have a subversive potential, says Domagoj Smoljo.
- Bitcoin can get people to think about money and capital in a new way - even people who themselves never owned a bitcoin.
For artists and creators can bitcoin also mean something good, says Domagoj Smoljo and Carmen Weisskop. It will be easier to pay and donate to cultural projects.
- As it looks now online, where everyone is dependent on the credit card or Paypal, can any organization restrict the movements of any reason. One can exclude people, freeze Paypal accounts. Bitcoin is a secure economic system that is distributed among the users, it is a much more direct transaction without some big companies as intermediaries. The decentralization of it is really interesting, says Domagoj Smoljo and Carmen Weisskop.
"Random darknet Shopper 2014" is interesting also because it pinpoints how the public learned to see the bitcoin: as something which is mainly used for shady transactions online, drug trafficking and weapons violations and money laundering. It is in such contexts currency mainly mentioned in the media - SvD Business, for example, called bitcoin for "bandit currency" (30 July 2013). And it is true that it is part of its allure for some. Or as Robin Teigland at the School explains, there are several different parallel movements and forces that are working for bitcoinekonomin. The ideological embossed libertarianerna who want to overthrow the central banks, the more practically oriented who wants to make it easier and more efficient to quickly pay someone on the other side of the world, and so are those who use Bitcoin, and other crypto currencies for trading in illegal goods and services.
- One can not ignore them - they are also, and it's a great motivator, says Robin Teigland.
And there are more objections to bitcoin. The currency is unstable and the course has changed a lot and quickly. Right now is a bitcoin worth about 1800 Swedish kronor, which most have been there five times the value. Confidence in bitcoinbörser and switching sites has fallen after the great Mt Gox crash. Bitcoinbörsen Mt Gox was one of the largest in the world, and for a period in 2013 they handled 70 percent of all bitcoinväxlingar in the world. But in February last year shut down suddenly, filed for bankruptcy and announced that 850,000 bitcoin (with the then exchange rate corresponded to about three billion) was gone. It was both clients' money and the company's own disappeared, gone forever - from people's wallets and from bitcoinekonomin. A few months later found the Mt Gox about a quarter of the lost money in an old bitcoinplånbok from 2011 - much like a traditional company would find a billion in an old plastic bag in someone's mattress. Exactly what happened with Mt Gox is still unclear: theft, fraud, mismanagement of the company or a combination of all.
Some also believe that bitcoinekonomin in fact, compared to a pyramid scheme or Ponzi scheme, in which early investors earn big money but those who do not withdraw before the system collapses become big losers. The American economist Nouriel Roubini, formerly the United States Department of the Treasury, is one of those who commented maximum critical of bitcoin and called the system a scam. Estonian central bank has also warned of bitcoin.
But it's pretty clear that bitcoinekonomin not meet the definitions of a Ponzi scheme. Any return promised not. There is no central protagonist or organization in the middle of the system, no owner. The system is also inherently transparent - even if it requires some technical pre-understanding to be able to grab it. Early investors may have made big money and some late investors have lost. But any conscious hoax, it is probably not a question, says Robin Teigland.
- If you look at how many people are connected to the network today, so it's hard to believe that it was the point. Anyone who makes the assessment has not been fully appreciated, and do not understand blockkedjetekniken and that it is the network that control. To take control of bitcoin have to take control of a very large amount of nodes [communicating devices] in the network, and it is not realistic. Maybe in the beginning, but not now. There are too many who are on the network. I am the Network! says Robin Teigland.
The European Banking Authority EBA and the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, FI, went in December 2013 issued a warning to consumers about the risks of virtual currencies that bitcoin. The warning is still adhered to, says Lars Malmström, who is Head of Consumer contact on FI.
- If you as a consumer chooses to use bitcoin must know that there is no common framework around it and no central issuer. And invests it in bitcoin, they can go up and down in value. A blank, car or dog is something substantial, but bitcoin has no substance but the value is based solely on supply and demand, says Lars Malmström.
This summer a new report by the EBA, which also takes up the risks to the financial system at large. Virtual currencies facilitates crime and terrorism, writes, among other things. Virtual currencies are not dependent on "units against which economic sanctions and embargoes can be done", which means that states and international organizations have no control over them. And if you do not regulate virtual currencies it will be "an uneven market for payment services" - in other words, currencies bitcoin outrank banks as regards transactions.
The EBA has however decided to defer to investigate the possible regulation; kryptovalutorna is still so small.
- It would require a very extensive rulemaking for a phenomenon which is certainly growing, but not yet widespread. So they have chosen not to proceed with a common regulatory framework right now, but merely urged financial companies that do not have, to buy or sell virtual currencies. You do not want the virtual currencies in the financial system, says Lars Malmström.
How would a regulatory framework look like?
- It is virtually impossible to answer. I doubt if it would be totally prohibitive. If you look at how they have regulated the financial sector and companies, so you need a permit to operate in the financial market. It's not an unreasonable guess that would restrict certain parts of the virtual currencies.
But who exactly is it they should regulate? There's no business or authority responsible for bitcoin.
- Yes, that's a good question. Bitcoin is not by definition a value. It is not e-money. It is not a payment. Here there has been a development that does not fit into the regulations that exist, says Lars Malmström.
Yes, it's complicated. The authorities have not yet defined bitcoin and the other kryptovalutorna: Are they a commodity or is the money? Unregulated or not, so it is quite possible that as a private individual use bitcoin for small purchases in everyday life now. That companies Webhallen and some Swedish VPN and hosting services accept bitcoin is perhaps not surprising, but one can also go to the chiropractor, get their floors sanded or nails done for bitcoin. Or float in a large tank full of salt water, which the Options Health in central Stockholm where co-owner and floating therapist Rune Eriksson took the initiative to accept payment in bitcoin.
- It is primarily interested in new technologies and new ways to market itself as the reason. Since it belongs to our philosophy that floatcenter to look beyond the ordinary in our society, finding new solutions to problems, says Rune Eriksson.
In particular, many are not as exercised the option to pay with bitcoin. A handful, less than ten, says Rune Eriksson.

Laugh all you want but you should know there is a large community of people who have moved to NH and are working hard toward limiting the states involvement in their own life. Whether that translates to other states adopting that behavior is another story. 
There is a huge bitcoin community with many of the same people. The same people who created some of the Bitcoin ATMs. Some of the big bitcoin names are members or friends of the FSP. While slow, their numbers do grow year after year. More of them running for office and actually getting elected every voting period.
The people who have moved or supported the FSP have done a lot of hard work. They campaign and read all the bills that are trying to be passed. They rate and review just about every officials voting record so you can see where the problems are.
The founders of cop block spawned from the FSP. There are countless stories that translate to exposing corruption and abuse such as the Weere recording police issue and the 'military equipment' given to the concord police. Helped maintaining the no seat belt law for adults. Still no income or sales tax. NH is a key state in every national election. Home brew bills have passed allowing for small brewery's. 
These are just the tid-bits of life with the FSP. There's a ton more going on that is not necessarily news worthy but still very interesting. So many people doing there own thing, together.
We are laughing too. Having a great time. It's been worth it.

Well, 'they', is always a bad term to use. Someone specific made the commercial, and those are their feelings and opinions. The FSP does not take a political position on anything except reducing the size and scope of government to protection against direct aggression. There are many completely rational people in the FSP. If you want to call someone out, do it.
The ending war claim may mean they personally do not fund the war, not that war will end. The more people with the ability to stop funding their war, will/could reduce their ability for war.
You repeatedly use 'they'. If you are talking about the Free Talk Live radio show, they are not the FSP. They are a shock-jock radio show. This is how you gather and maintain listeners. I can't really address these concerns as they are pretty scattered.


It would be highly difficult to change the 21 million limit, maybe not impossible. Bug's can be fixed. I'm not sure what you are trying to say. Many people say a lot of mis-information about bitcoin.


You should be saying the same thing about Satoshi then because he specifically mentioned the government being the problem as to why he/they created bitcoin.
| Satoshi:  Yes, (we will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography), but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.
| Satoshi: (Bitcoin is) very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly. I’m better with code than with words though.


You have a lot of balls to expect things from other people. 
If you have this mindset it is no wonder you feel this way. What should I be doing for you? Sorry for being aggressive but I wanted to make it clear for anyone else reading that your experience is specific to you and not everyone has this experience.
You are playing mental gymnastics by applying the views of a few people onto the whole group. I'm sorry your exposure of the FSP left you with that mindset. I have a feeling it must have been a small handful from Keene.
TLDR; Free State Project is not Free Talk Live. Satoshi understood the need to limit the governments spending power. We are all individuals and have many opinions on government, bitcoin, and how to live our lives.

Overdue payments in BTCJam
No info in I was just looking for information about the bitswitch and noticed a deleted post from ON THIS THREAD saying: Yes I'm about to do a public release of the demo.. Anyone want to help out for shares and BTC?
Sad to see but I would not trust or give any money to him at this point. I wish it were not the case. Throwing manic ideas against the wall to see what sticks.
seems to be Morgan possibly?
I also just found a post on my first thread live at CES where I never saw the comment from 1 month ago: 
I will when BitPay sends me back all the hardware I sent them with those funds for he BitPay Bowl Football game bullshit they robbed me on in Florida. Tell Tony to send us back the hardware so we can pay the loan off we received due to their 10 BitSwitch order we shipped, they didn't fully pay, they OWE us and YOU money.. And until our priorities are set as property is about to be purchased so we own our HQ, that is my priority, for now I can compensate all investors with KSHARES our counterparty equity approved by California secretary of state at 10 billion shares, that is currently all I can match BTCJam investors with future potentials and tokens to exchange. Until BitPay pays me back or I sue the shit out of them, I'm funded only by my own trades and investments. Paying interest back on BTC is not debt. Get your financial and property concepts figured out please. I have only intention on making everyone safe, funded and happy. Shares of my company will be more valuable the BTC itself, so if that can help with time as I gather enough guy funds to keep our lights and internet on while paying off loans which I do every month. Please be patient.

Thank you for (your) perspective of the gold scam.
1.) True. But if you really think about it, this is a problem with anything including bitcoin. Do you KNOW how much is currently available? How many have been lost? (You know the total current and max, but not actual available.) Going forward this will even be a bigger problem right? More people more lost coins? 
Question: What does verifying the total available gold allow you to do? What is possible for you to verify 'anything' exists? How many apples are there? Red bricks? Can you verify how many airplanes exist?
2.) What should a STORE of value do? We need to eat, so beef wouldn't be a good store of value right? What are you trying to say? Not being able to counterfeit, scientific application, and store of value are things gold 'does' well. They still talk about gold daily on the markets. Again what do you want your store of value to 'do'? What exactly happens that makes gold not function as it does today?
3.) Okay. I agree. If everyone used gold, there wouldn't be many big piles of it making it hard to steal a lot of it at once. We store value in it instead and protect it. That does cost currency. I have to protect my data(value-work-effort) every once in a while by buying new hard drives (store of value). Sometimes security costs. (I don't believe that everyone should be using gold as a currency, but a little is okay for store of value.)
4.) Speculation, but still plausible. It is possible this can change, but change can take a long time. You are speculating the change, which gold still currently is being used as a show of wealth or investment. You are arguing what you think might happen, against the facts of what currently happens.
5.) Some people want fake, some people want real. I don't think this says anything about real gold. You have to test your bitcoin to make sure they are real right? Someone hands you a paper wallet, maybe just a quick check of the blockchain is necessary?
6.) Sure, it's expensive when you have to buy large chunks of it. I've owned gold, don't have it anymore, I needed to USE it, and it worked.
I get it, you don't like gold jewelry and like to minimize the scientific application. You don't want to use gold as a currency. But scam doesn't work here. Gold is a legitimate precious metal, AU on the periodic table. What other physical objects made of elements would you rather use? The periodic table, those are the choices, except for 'math' based currencies.
I like metals, and bitcoin. Recycling metal is awesome. Gold doesn't get destroyed very easily. You can recycle it over and over again. Wonder material! Aluminum can do the same thing, but there's a bunch more aluminum available. [Prices of Elements and their compounds](

An important part of creating a Bitcoin wallet is ensuring the random numbers used to create the wallet are truly random. Physical randomness is better than computer generated pseudo-randomness. The easiest way to generate physical randomness is with dice. To create a Bitcoin private key you only need one six sided die which you roll 99 times. Stopping each time to record the value of the die. When recording the values follow these rules: 1=1, 2=2, 3=3, 4=4, 5=5, 6=0. By doing this you are recording the big random number, your private key, in B6 or base 6 format. You can then enter the 99 character base 6 private key into the text field above and click View Details. You will then see the Bitcoin address associated with your private key. You should also make note of your private key in WIF format since it is more widely used.
*You would need to flip the coin more times due to not having the available randomness of 6 sides vs 2. Not sure how many, but the process would be the same.

- Mainly it-interested young men ...
Bitcoinföretagen work but actively to spread the gospel of currency beyond the nerd guys. This weekend organized market Bitcoin funfair at Kägelbanan in Stockholm, where visitors will switch to the $ 100 in bitcoin to buy things of the exhibitors - artists, designers, artists and bitcoinföretag. The market is sponsored by Bitcenter, a newly bitcoinplånboksapp, and organized by the magazine and communication agency The Forumist.
- I myself believe very much in bitcoin, it is interesting from a longer-term policy perspective, says Pejman Biroun of evaporation, which is the chief editor at The Forumist.
With the market wants to bring out the bitcoin to a wider audience. And Pejman Biroun Vand describes the collaboration as a "win-win" situation, where exhibitors and bitcoinföretaget both serve at the meeting.
Bitcoinvärlden need someone who can help them find the right match, the right personalities that can be seen in their context. A common bitcoinevent is otherwise pretty boring. There is only techies collected.
How small and marginal bitcoinekonomin is, it is the eminently already present in the community. Swedish police have been forced to learn how to manage Bitcoin when the currency seized in criminal investigations. The tax authorities have been forced to decide how to value added tax the trade of bitcoin, in a case that is now up in the European Court of Justice and will be determined during the year. And companies engaged in mining affects the economy in small communities Constance.
Erik Svensson is CEO at Boden development, a municipal corporation that works to promote growth in Boden, including by helping companies establish themselves. It's Boden development which leases the helicopter hangar which is now full of KNC's bitcoinminers, and Erik Svensson was one of those who had the first meetings with KNC just over a year ago.
- There has not been a straightforward journey, to understand what this is. A lot has happened in a year.
Erik Svensson had heard about bitcoin, he says, but did not know how it worked. The representatives of the KNC explained, drew up the technology on a whiteboard.
- I began to understand more and more. I have worked with the company since 1977, helped finance things, but never anything like that. We asked ourselves: how is this to be done, how it works, how do we do to cover up the risk?
What are the risks concerned about yourselves?
- Is there still a couple of years, we will get paid? It was such issues that were last fall. But that's history now.
Now Boden development on the train. It has been discussed ideas: Maybe you can start accepting bitcoin payment of the entire business center Create Boden, the hotel and conference facility? Erik Svensson and his colleagues have even acquired their own bitcoinplånböcker.
- Yes, we bought a few dollars each, so that you know what it is, says Erik Svensson.
Another bitcoinföretag has established itself in Constance, British Hydro 66 who rents a small local a few hundred meters from the KNC's giant hangar. When we are there in August stands there only a few lonely shelves with processors. Christian Keet, who is visiting from London to look for the little mine, says that it is mostly an experiment so far. But he praises the local authority - it has been extremely helpful, he says.
The approximately 30 employees at KNC does not sound like many new jobs for the municipality. But synergies are significantly larger, says Erik Svensson.
- It is from that they hire an electrician for lunch places they visit, construction companies and ventilation firms and security companies who receive assignments. It's all around you.
In the area around the hangars works about a hundred people now, according to Erik Svensson. And they would love that more data center establishes itself in Constance. There is land; the old airfield is empty and desolate. This past year, he and his colleagues visited fairs and presented itself for many companies in bitcoin- and data center industry. The problem is the energy. The supply of power control, and it is limited.

The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.
