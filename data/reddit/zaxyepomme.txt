You can instant buy with coinbase with debit card.
@_date: 2018-05-28 12:05:05
You should fake it again, or tell them. A bullshit story like "the thing is that my parents found me abandoned in the street , they did all the legal paper work to adopte me, but they obvioulsy didint knew my real date of birth, i was between 8 or 5 months at the time, so I have 2 official DOB. But it would be better if you fake it again haha

Coin base its pretty easy and quick, you can instant buy with débit or crédit card. And they have a phone apps. If you are canadian you can use Quadricacx or coinsquare too
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:28:32
Do you have a us bank account?
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:59:50
I dont know about coinbase regulation In Dominican Republic but with coinbase you can buy with debit card with your US account.  The fee are like 4% but maybe it will be easier for you to deal with your US account.
@_date: 2018-05-14 01:51:21
The prices are in Canadian $
@_date: 2018-05-10 11:42:59
Try it, but I think if you go in your coinbase setting a change your name it will work. It's pretty quick and easy

You should make a account with coinbase, and Binance, probably other exchange too, you can go to localbitcoin to find BTC ATM near you. Coinbase is really usefull, they a a mobile app and you can instant purchase with a debit card. I kind of in a hurry right now but you can PM me if you have any questions. (I am not a cryptocurrencies expert but I'm into this since september 2017) 
@_date: 2018-05-28 00:00:23
Maybe coinbase it's not the BEST option ever, but you can still send your bitcoin from coinbase to anywhere else.

Coinsquare or BTC atm, but I always used Quadrigacx. (And Coinsquare like one time but it is good) what is the issue with QuadrigaCX? I didn't withdraw since january. What happening?
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:10:01
If ypu are canadian you can use Quadrigacx they send 100$ gift cards. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 02:01:40
@_date: 2018-06-07 01:51:28
If you are from Canada you can use Quadrigacx. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 21:35:40
Sorry for that lost, never ever trust someone on the internet when is crypto related. Karma will get him.ia ypu still have btc to sell use BTC ATM (there is alots of them more that you can think of) or if ypu need to send them to someone meet that person in a public place and secure place . there is also alots of trusty platform/exchange on the internet.I deal with Quadrigacx because I'm from Canada, so I dont know the others but they exist. I hope ypu didint lost alots. Stay safe and trust no one

@_date: 2018-06-06 19:05:42

@_date: 2018-06-07 02:23:20
Scammed by who? What did you tried to do? You could have gone to localbition.com to find bitcoin atm near you? Or send it to a person of trust.  Or sell it on coinbase If coinbase allow that on your country,

One night in 2010 I was super drunk, It was my 20th Birthday, I tried to put 1000$ into Bitcoin, and I was to drunk to find how we do that, next morning when I sober up I was so happy that I didint do this.  I regret thats times to times

@_date: 2018-11-08 19:01:34
People will pay to get prank videos? Good luck dude I hope you will get the 10 000$. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 02:29:51
You could start to make a Binance account. And you can tried to find a BTC atm near you( Google it, there is alots more that we imagine.) you could also buy it in person, a public place and all. BTW trust no-one on the internet they will scam you, do not transfer money to random stanger in exchange for BTC. You will get scamed.
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:58:57
Be carefull, I dont  think that you want to scam someone, but you can end up being scammed.
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:54:16
Maybe just cash out 45% 75% of your BTC? Did you made profits at least? Or trade a. Certain % your BTC for any others Crypto and cash out the rest? I know time it's hard right now, If you have to cash out , do it, but I think It could be smart to leave a certain amounts in crypto, maybe you will thanks me in 2 years, or maybe not.
