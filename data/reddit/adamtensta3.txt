Not saying its the right call. Yet I would wager that he a pretty thorough understanding of it in general sense.
What I take issue with is when people like the above poster say that the only reason he doesnt embrace it is solely because he is trying to preserve his current investment and is threatened by btc. It would be absurd to think that for the reasons I said in the other post.

lol. Yes, because if Warren saw bitcoin as a gamechanger at this early stage he wouldnt shift his strategy towards it based on nothing other than ideology.
Just face it. He did the analysis, and he doesnt think too much of BTC. Not because he doesnt understand it, or thinks it threatens his business. If he did, he would shift towards investing in it.
What would be the better strategy: Warren sees BTC as a threat but tries to fight it to maintain his (lets just say) 0.01% influence in the current financial system, or he sees BTC as a threat so he switches gears and corners a 10% influence over the btc market through building the infrastructure? 
The answer should be evident

At this early stage the community, speculators, merchants, miners etc are all on the same rowboat, with each having a paddle. Once Bitcoin matures, interests will start to drift inwards towards each particular player.
For now though, the community and Bitpay are interchangeable in the general sense.

"we" is not the same as "i"

Weak logic. If he truly felt btc was a threat to his buisness or he could make money off of it, it would be easier and more profitable for him to embrace it at this early stage rather than fight to preserve the current system.
