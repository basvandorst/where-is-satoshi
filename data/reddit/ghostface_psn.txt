Im new to all of this... If blockchain says the funds were sent and the transaction has been confirmed, but coinbase has zero record of it, is there a chance my money is still in transit?
@_date: 2017-09-08 12:28:15
Is that it?
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:59:44
Yes, it seems that people are having the exact same issue. One person has been waiting 5 hours from blockchain to coinbase.

I just went to the website, logged in as usual.

Virus scan in progress. What am I looking for in my extensions?
@_date: 2017-09-08 12:26:55
I tried this and it didnt change the address. I also have made a few transactions in the last 24 hrs.

Any advice on a virus scanner or something that can check for this?

I'm a little new to the BTC game, but to confirm, if the transaction is confirmed and I haven't gotten the coins, they are lost for sure?

Is there any reason why my Coinbase wallet address changes when I click "RECEIVE"? It seems to be changing every time I log in and log out.

A development. Is my address to receive the same in Coinbase no matter what? Because I opened 2 browser windows with the same account and the addresses are different. I'm going to reply to this with an imgur pic.

What is the support email address? I cant seem to find one. Just the form on the site. Thanks

Where would it be if it were safe?
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:30:35
I went through the address history... it seems it is IN my history. So where the fuck are my bitcoins??? 
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:04:18
That would be great if someone can offer some insight. I'm done with a virus and malware scan and they found nothing. I'm new to this and not certain of all the technical aspects, but I think the address I sent the BTC to has already moved them, if I'm reading the blockchain correctly.
