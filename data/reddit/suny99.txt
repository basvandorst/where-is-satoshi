It's just an exchange (crypto to local currency) not a store in it's full meaning! But it's great to have something where you can easily exchange your crypto.

Yeah that's a big minus for them. I'm guessing tourist will be more interested if they know what it's for.

So you work for Bitcoin, right? I mean you're getting paid at your job in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-12 21:11:02
Product quality, like would you rather pay more for something that you know will last longer or gamble with something cheaper
@_date: 2019-05-12 19:29:41
But what about other cryptos there's plenty of coins that offer very low fees and real time transactions?
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:31:29
But where's the benefit for you then
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:55:31
Just out of curiosity why didn't you sell at let's say 18K and cut your losses?

But we have to wait until lightning network reaches larger scales
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:18:58
That's good to hear
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:50:56
Seems like a very reasonable explanation
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:46:12
I can see where are you going with this. So you're saying for today and close future BTC is still an asset for you which you think one day will be currency that's gonna replace fiat. And you're rather keep it to buy more stuff one it's worth grows even more. 
But let's say we're 40 years in the future and today is that day when BTC is becoming official world currency. And yesterday the last day when USD was official currency you had let's say $1 000 000 worth of BTC. And that's a lot you can buy yourself a nice real estate rent it have a nice life. 
But since today BTC has become official currency with that same amount of BTC ($ 1 000 000) you can buy only 2 rooms apartment in an old building. Cuz someone somewhere has decided that amount of BTC worth that much.
Can you explain why you think something like that won't happen? BTC is centralized in a manner that few people holds most of it. Same as USD, few rich families holds most of it. So really they have a power to decide how much that currency will worth in real world

No hold strategy on my side, I mostly do trading. Buy low, sell with some profits, it's nothing much or something I do every day just when I see an opportunity. Of course there are times when I'm wrong and I take my losses that's why I asked you why you didn't take losse. But now I understand your strategy

Only btc interesting. How do you pay your bills?
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:16:59
Ummm yeah but in my experience many people see BTC as an asset not currency. It's just another form of stock for them. That's why I'm asking this. If you are accepting BTC as currency to buy things or you would just buy it and hold it or trade with it so one day you can cash out for fiat
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:19:16
lol at least it's nice to hear that you would
@_date: 2019-05-12 23:00:29
But one more problem in underdeveloped regions is that they are underdeveloped so can they even afford internet or pc or mobile phone? Do they even have an access to internet?
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:24:59
Like yeah something like that but that it really is a shop not just reselling site. I mean what's the differece for you as a user, right? There is no difference just saying it would be nice to have a proper BTC or crypto store where you have everything.
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:49:49
Why don't we use some other crypto there is plenty of them with lower fees and faster transactions. It's like we are blindly stuck with old car cuz we know it serves us well and we're used to it. Maybe it's time to buy a new car?
@_date: 2019-05-13 10:32:00
Is it a secret what's your job? If it is never mind sorry for asking, I'm just curious ��
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:52:22
Why are you so sure?
@_date: 2019-05-12 17:16:55
ummm but what about mining fee?
@_date: 2019-05-12 19:25:03
Can you elaborate why?
@_date: 2019-05-13 10:35:37
That's cool, it is interesting to hear that some people work only for Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:41:41
That's correct not many people use BTC as it is intended. They mostly use it to gain some more in fiat worth
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:43:03
When you're buying do you aim for quality or lower price?
