Well, I guess with this super volatile time you have a chance to make it up.
Buy large amount for &lt;3 dollars of asking price; eg 212USD per coin. 
Sell large amount for 215. so - fee ( 0.6% ) and you make x number of dollars per no. of coins wagered.
So if we want 55 dollars back, 55/2 about 28 coins for the risk.

I work in a country with similar problem for the locals as you. Most bills get sent to a PO Box number where you have to go to collect. And it seems most exchanges don't accept PO Box.
So only way these chaps are getting bitcoins is through me or my co-worker. So far, out of 5 people I have told about it, only one bought in. And he did it direct with exchanges, as he is a brit but has a wife and house in Prague.
I think your best bet is to build up a relationship with someone who will deal directly with you. Someone who will probably show that trust by sending you a bitcoin, or part of one first.

Out of all the stocks, this is the one that has been fairly constant, and delivering.

This I think is the stumbling block for bitcoin. It needs to be understood technically to be able to use it.
For one, you want to have a clue about keeping your wallet safe, and not loosing it when your 5 year old family PC has a disk crash and you can't recover your wallet.
The other thing I am experiencing is buying bitcoins. If you see some opportunity, and its being transacted in bitcoins, and you want in on it fast - you are out of luck.
Even sites trying to answer this quickly run into bottle necks. We have a site in NZ that allows you to do a quick online bank transfer for coins. The problem is, he runs out of coins fast.

@_date: 2013-11-15 15:50:14
Just remember we started the year with one bitcoin in early [January 2013]( worth around 13 USD. It went to $266 in April, then within hours dropped back to 50USD. It has been a fairly constant slow rise since then, until October. Then we started this madness. Enjoy it while it lasts, but don't be surprised if we have a temporary correction to under USD 200 again. Just remember, it has repeated this cycle quite a few times in its 5 year lifetime. Each time rising higher than the previous all time high. So if you don't panic, and need the cash...hold on to those coins...they will gain again.
@_date: 2013-10-23 16:39:13
Oops, one point I forgot. We said 55 loss for one coin only. So if you bought 30 coins at 266, then that means 30x28 coins you would need to buy sell to gain USD55 back per coin. At least that is how I figure it.

Its not just about bitcoin that people don't get. 
What is happening is technology is leaving people behind regardless if they get it or not. The new elite are going to be those in tech-sector areas. Jobs are increasingly being automated. Skills are becoming obsolete. Jobless rates are increasing, and there is no work for them without retraining. This is why America has so many prisons. No work for the unskilled, non-tech, so make ordinary living for them a crime and lock them away.

But isn't one of the scary things about bitcoin for the wealthy is they can't hide their money. The blockchain knows all. So no more 'bribes' without it being exposed. No more cartel money being washed anonymously.
So I think a lot of the wealthy will still choose the existing fiat structure to hide their piles of cash.

What gives me pause is the fact that like torrents, it is here to stay. They can try and fight it ( hello Blockbuster, how did that work out for you ), or they can adjust. Why the government would not want to adjust, is precisely because we CAN track bitcoins. They don't want us knowing their dollars sent for rebuilding a 'liberated' country goes into funding terrorism. So they are absolutely terrified of bitcoins. They can't hide their dirty tricks.

I don't think shrinkage is all that negligible. I know one person who has bitcoins on a crashed linux hard drive that he can't be bothered rescuing. Sure it may only be a few coins, but I am a late comer to bitcoins, and yet I know one real example. How many others know first hand encounters of 'shrinkage'.

Lets ball park the numbers. Say you buy 10 bitcoins.
Now you have the options of letting those bitcoins do the following:
* Sit in wallet and wait for prices to rise
* Put in interesting accumulating website like [coinlenders](
* Move into some shares say at [BTC-TC](
* None of the above, remain undecided.

Fair comment I reckon. 
I too suspect a lot of the 'news' regarding bitcoin is just existing businesses trying to gain free advertising. 
But bitcoins is making an impact. Finally had someone other than myself talk about it at work yesterday. I got him to load a wallet and then pursue various forums for more info on bitcoins. 
So I think the true spread of bitcoins will be word of mouth to the genuinely curious. At the moment all the action as far as real shops seems to be mostly in the USA.  This will be interesting if they decide to crack down on it, and declare anyone dealing in bitcoins needs a Money Transfer Licence.
@_date: 2013-10-18 06:17:11
What about the news of no wire transfers from the US. Will that dampen the foreign markets like bitstamp and gox. When I say no, I mean more expensive fees from somebanks to continue sending and others just not doing it. See [this]( thread about the wire transfers.

I see bitcoins relationship to banks similar to movie and music piracy to telcos. It generates money for them. Banks are getting a cut every time we want to purchase bitcoins off exchanges by the fees they charge for us to get our cash to the exchanges.

It could be as simple as what is happening to me. 
* I am getting ready for a holiday. I am putting my spending on bitcoins on hold till I get back. 
* I have my assets lined up nicely at the moment, where I get a nice return in bitcoins each week. So I can just let it ride for a while.
* Summertime is here, and I won't be doing my normal routine of scanning the web daily for life around bitcoins.

Like all securities, they are given worth by your trust in the issuer. In this case, if you trust AsicMiner, you buy their shares in the coloured coin network. You don't have to worry about the exchange being  shutdown, the same way we don't worry about the bitcoin protocol being shut down anymore. You only point of failure is AsicMiner, will they keep issuing dividends because you hold 'shares' by the number of coloured coins you have of their brand. 
Direct shareholders are doing this already to a degree with AsicMiner, as there is no 'company' between share holders of AsicMiner and AsicMiner. Just a list of bitcoin addresses where payments go.

I think some people purchase equipment for the ease of 'getting coins' versus other methods. And it never stops giving... just in ever decreasing amounts.
But I suspect getting 20 coins, sticking them in a [Coinlenders]( account to earn daily interest of 0.055% might be just as profitable. ( Returns about 0.01 bitcoins a day, about the same as [10 block erupter usb sticks]( without the power costs ).

He has a point. I am like minded in that regard. Lower price means greater opportunity to buy to me.
It seems to me that a few people are only using bitcoins to fleece the weak hands, and not taking the long term view on this becoming a much more valuable tool in the future.
Imagine not having to pay extortion fees to do commerce. Imagine sellers being comfortable knowing when someone has paid for goods or services they are not going to recall their money.

Are you asking about verification for the KNC/AML process? OR just how fast money lands in your account? 
I set up a BitStamp account a while ago once MtGox troubles started with withdrawals. I didin't verify the account tilll close to the deadline. Deposits are a breeze, and I am talking from a Middle Easter bank to their bank. Usually arrives in 3 days for me. Not withdrawn any, so not sure how long that takes.

As long as people still value AM, then your shares are most likely able to be sold for what you paid for them.

I think it would be very easy. The blockchain tells us if it is a freshly minted coin. Very simple to compile these list of addresses to start with. Then immediately black list them till people come forward and join the government approved white-list. So start off, all addresses blacklisted. What to use your coins with a merchant?  Go get your address white-listed by government sanctioned list.

This is from myus.com:

"Thank you for your patience. Our Compliance team has determined the ECCN for this item is 5A002. This ECCN is government controlled. Unfortunately, we do not the proper license to legally export this item."
Second Email:
"The item was classified based on the information from the manufacturer. They supplied us the ECCN and we do not have the proper license to export an item with that ECCN."
So first time round they say they categorised it.
Next time round the blame the manufacturer. 
Either way, don't use myus.com, as they will destroy your block erupters as you can't return them to CanaryInTheMine, and you can't get a refund.

You are probably right. I did another transfer ( from another bank, in yet another country outside USA ), and it cleared on MtGox in less than a day! I had exactly the name of the account complete with commas as was on their website.

I think what is different now is the tools available to the casual investor, and prior experience from what we learned in April. 
1. Bitstamp allowing cash in and out. So people go here to buy.
2. MtGox allowing to sell bitcoins at top price.
3. Tracking websites and mobile phone apps giving alerts on price movements.
