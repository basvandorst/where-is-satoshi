Makes me wonder.  If 2018 will be a good year for crypto, will we see BTC or ETH brining in the most growth? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:52:33
Oh so you think all of crypto is dead? 
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:54:50
And why dont you want to use an exchange?  So the chargeback is easier?
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:30:00
i'm convinced
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:56:51
This is because there are less tranasctiobs from the crash and new money pulling out and a semi stagnant market right now..  it is not increased transaction speeds, just less traffic.

@_date: 2018-01-06 19:40:31
Then just sign up on CoinBase and buy 20 of whatever.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:04:32
This is the dumbest thing I have ever read.  So you hold at 20k and now sell at the 6 week low.
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:54:41
Will it ever go below 8500?  What group and news?

Ledger nano should use this as a commercial 
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:48:17
What a shit 2 weeks.

Thats not it all.

Rinse and repeat every 15 minutes.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:32:47
Okay cool.  I'll continue to by 6 week lows.  You wait for that ATH.

Amazon is a verified retailer.  That is where I got mine.  Them or the official Ledger site is all I would trust.

Do some research before doing things with real money.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:13:49
If you are able to take funds you have in traditional stocks and use that to purchase cryptos, this is huge.
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:58:29
bitcoin was first and kind of acts as the gold standard in crypto.  You are correct, the real world application of bitcoin isn't going to go anywhere, thats for the new cryptos.  Its like investing in gold and diamonds.
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:46:36
Is gemini free to transfer to binance like coinbase/gdax is?
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:16:20
Hah man i was just kidding.  You got it right:)

You shouldn't try.  You literally did zero of your own research.  How do I know?  Because these questions have been answered no less thab 50,000 times on reddit alone, let alone on the internet.

Not too sure best course of action for euro but there are ways around it i know for USD 
I do coinbase and attached a bank account for deposits.  Cheaper than using a card.  Then transfer that to gdax exchange for free snd purchase litecoin  (moving litecoin around is faster and cheaper than bitcoin)  then i send that to an exchange that has altcoins i want and buy bitcoin there.  Then use that bitcoin to purchase the altcoins.
I highly suggest if you are going in with 5k that you get a ledger nano s.  Also one of the best youtubers i feel is DataDash to learn more about how this all works and market info.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:40:47
Realtalk:  bitcoins arent files, you never have them in your possession ever. 
The blockchain holds everything.  You know just hold a key that tells the blockchain.  "Hansnicolaim is entitled to 1 btc that is stored on me."  Lose your key and your bitcoin is gone forever.

@_date: 2017-12-23 05:20:15
that be like doubling your fee to just get 2 cents
its is more of an ADH thing.. like its mine its there but can't do anything about it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:27:33
Got some at 11,900 from coinbase.  Did you try buying with lynced bank account?  Probably less stressful (and cheaper)  than insta purchase via a card.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:36:13
Not too bad.  Cheaper than coinbase instant for sure.  But a few bucks more than a bank deposit to coinbase.  But hell, those take a week and a half.  Pretty fair price on the ATMs comparatively.  Nice!
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:01:26
I can't wait.  Watch the dumpster fire and all the Chicken Littles running around screaming.  Then ill buy more and see the hodlrs back at 20k in a week.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:00:17
Ledger nano s or paper.

You spent years my ass.  You can literally figure out what the basics are in crypto in an hour on youtube.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:14:02
Lets do this boys!
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:59:21
Dumbest thing I've read all day.  Feel so bad for your grandpa.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:33:59
Yah if you ever want to get into the game get your account verifications goin.  Also when you deposit from a bank account it takes a week and a half at least to get to your account.  So you want to deposit even if you dont like the price bc when you meed to buy and you dont have money in thete it is the worst feeling hah.
You can purchase instantly with cards but the fees are crazy.  Im talking $1,000 fom bank account is like $7 fee.  $1,000 on a card is kike $20.
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:51:00
So what hapoens if USA government says "it is illegal to deposit money onto crypto exchanges ." ?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:32:20

Just asking bc if you are UK you have different options than us Yanks.

Your profits would be exactly the same with just the added risk of someone fucking over everyone else.  What the hell is the point?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:28:12
You cant just sign up and put money in from your bank account.  It takes almost a week.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:59:54
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:18:02
Okay, maybe google around or post another thread if noone can answer you in this one about UK exchanges.  You have to do ID verification on all these exchanges and you might have a better route on a UK exchange.  I however am unfamiliar with that market.

Why did you sell?  Bitcoin has been going nowhere but up.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:58:29
Thays why we need crytpo adoption.  Once you are paying your cable bill, utilities, groceries, car payments with crytpo and the corporations are on board bc payments are faster, cheaper, more secure and their customers personal info cant be leaked and hacked and they are saving billions from their billing departments and cyber security govt cant do shit.  Doesn't matter who is running this shit show, big business and power calls all the shots.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:18:42
this is exactly what made me think of this hah.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:06:05
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:18:01
lets break it down...
you put in $100 in alone by yourself.  price goes up to $500.  You made $400.
you and 9 other schmucks put $100 each ($1,000) price goes up to $500 (your circle-jerk makes $4,000)
now there are 10 of you with $4,000 so lets hand out the big payoff.  $400 each.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:59:54
This is literally the definition of a free market.  No rules, no regulations..  everyone wants to say fuck the government and banks and then bitch when shit like what coinbase did happened.  This IS the free market!
Edit:  To clarify I am all for the free market and hope crypto hurts the banks and the govt can't control it.  People do have to realize however it is the wild west.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:16:53
i don't see how you can change the fee on binance.. it just auto-fills in .00100000
edit. just saw the min. withdrawl limit is .002
so it seems they are lost forever.
crazy b/c .002 is about $25.. and its $14 fee to transfer out... that is ridiculous
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:12:14

Transfer from coinbase to gdax.  It is free and instant. Coinbase owns gdax exchange.

There are people here who bought at ATH and are super close to the Buy 1 Get 1 Free BTC price!
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:11:11
Gdax if you already bought on coinbase and only want to do byc eth or ltc.
Otherwsise i like bittrex the most especially if you want to get into altcoins.
If you already have coinbase funds and want to do bittrex send ltc and not btc.  Btc fees are ridiculous.  Then just trade your ltc for btc on bittrex and use btc to purchase your altcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:06:30
My problem is i want to get bitcoin to buy alt coins and not sure if i should be purchasing bitcoin or litecoin on gdax to send to binance.  I know ltc is cheaper but i would have to exchange that back to btc once on binance.  But now i am reading that btc is free to send too... will it just take days?  
Why is the recommendation to buy ltc and send that to binance and buy btc with it then alt?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:32:25
Goddamn panhandlers

Dont have 190k in a savings account at 19. Have your money make money. Nothing stupid tho.  Figure out your budget.  Have an emergency savings account.  Get an IRA and put the majority in there. If i had 190k and wanted to play with crypto id take 1-2k and get my feet wet in crypto.  Do not be stupid.  You are sitting on quite a nice nest egg.  Most 19 year olds are living off ramen.

Coinbase is easier for noobs but high fees
Gdax is owned by coinbase and is their exchange.  No fees.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:28:02
Ever see "Eyes Wide Shut?"
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:15:39
is it free to send funds to another exchange like it is in gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:28:08
At least you made 5500.  Think about putting 1k of your profits into something like Litecoin and this time hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:01:37
Didnt sell anything, just moved EVERYTHING off coinbase and gdax.  
Fucking fascists.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:07:13
What kind of fees do these have?  Or is it just a walk up Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:50:07
If she was a cunt just transfer it to a wallet only you have the keys for.  When she brings up BTC to the lawyer just say "What the fuck is BTC?"
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:37:18
Screw trying to make this more simple, i will just stick to using LTC and know the fees are way less if incurred.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:07:13
Dont trade on coinbase, use an exchange..  coinbase owns gdax so you can transfer your funds for free to gdax from coinbase..  do limit orders as well for fee savings.  Bittrex is another popular one if you feel like you might want to dabble into altcoins as well.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:58:42
Its funnier this way, look at that dudes face lolll

Never transfer bitcoin to a different exchange.  Fees are that high, yes.  Use ETH or litecoin.  I prefer litecoin.

Definitely taxes on it.  Your rate would be based upon if held over a year and income.  Probably exchange fees as well.

This is a very nice email.  They didn't have to do it.  This has nothing to do with coinbase.  They are just letting you know that a lot of CC companies are now handling crypto purchases as cash advances, same as if you took out fiat at an ATM with your CC, and applying the same fees.  Coinbase is doing nothing differently on their side in regards to their fees.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:34:47
I hear ya but this is strictly CC.  If you deposit via bank account there is not an additional cash advance.
