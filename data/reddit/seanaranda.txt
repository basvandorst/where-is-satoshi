I am an honest man and I have to say my google-fu is just that good.  I did have to read quite a bit though haha.  I hope that doesn't spoil the contest!
You are the true gentleman and scholar!

Just bought the car kit... needed some jumper cables anyway.  Great idea! The process after paying (confirming it is shipping to my address) is not super intuitive. I paid but no email and it didn't take me to my shopping cart or confirmation page or anything.  It does say paid though.  I am actually finding it difficult to find currently but I am sure I will figure it out, but more of a heads up for edits to your site in the future.

Though I have heard of bitcoin for years, I have only come to accept and really teach myself more about it over the past few months.  Your description here has cleared up any confusion I had in the past and thought you did great in the debate.  
I was particularly frustrated when he was saying there was little risk to early adopters.  I purposely did not buy at $20 because of the risk but recently bought at $500.  I am sure comments like that can be frustrating to people like you who took the challenges on in the early stages.

Got a speedy email reply from Michael and recommend trying their site out!

I agree and I go over how I don't think any of these will take off other than Bitcoin.  I just decided to play with a small amount of money this past week and the markets have been going nuts.  Figured I would share my newby experiences

duh it is a scam.  Paying 64% odds on doubling your money, DO THE MATH PEOPLE.  you would think people smart enough to figure out how to set up their wallet could figure out that can't add up.
