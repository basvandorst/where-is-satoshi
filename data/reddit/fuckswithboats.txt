TIL - 1000% gains are considered a crash
I mean if BTC drops to &lt; $3,000 USD we can call it a crash. 
The last year has been fucking insane -- a correction was due.

I would imagine *his eyes and ears*.
I, too, love the idea of a *cryptocurrency* but none of these coins are useful as a currency today because of the rampant speculation. 
That doesn't mean it's not cool and that definitely doesn't mean that blockchain technology is not here to stay, or even that BTC won't reach $1M USD.

Can I ask why you say that? 
Can you help educate me on *why a Bitcoin is worth $15,000 USD* and a Litecoin is only $350? 
What makes BTC more valuable?

What do you mean? 
You claimed those shitting on crypto had no clue what they were talking about so I asked if *you could help educate someone* who admits that they don't have a fucking clue what's next. 


Exactly, as in any market *what someone will pay for it sets the value*. 
Only in the crypto market, especially considering the fact that out of my six friends who own crypto **not one hold their own private keys**, there is literally nothing *behind the crypto* whereas with a commodity there is an item theoretically of some consumer/industrial value and with a stock you have a company that *hopefully makes money*. 
What do you have with crypto? 


Irrelevant when you can fork the code and create the next coin. It's all about *what people believe*. 
The HODL'ers help solidify the market and then there are folks like me *who want an actual cryptocurrency* and even more who are looking for a get rich quick scheme.
So if someone is "shitting on crypto" make sure that you spend enough time listening to their arguments so that you can determine if they are churning FUD, full of shit, or providing you *honest advice based on their experience*. 
If you're under 40, it's likely that you haven't been *bit by a bubble*.
If you're under 30, it's likely you don't even *remember what a bubble looks like*. 
So remember maybe it's not that *the old guys don't get it*, it's just that they've seen this *type of thing before* regardless of the medium. 
Just my .0000014BTC.

At least you sold yours. 
Some poor sap bought $100 worth back when they were pennies on the dollar with the intention of *trying to buy weed online*. 
Ultimately *pussied out from making a silk road purchase* and lost the machine w/ the keys. 
Who even knows what 1,250 of those bitcoins would be worth today.
