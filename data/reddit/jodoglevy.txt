I understand that technically yes it is possible to detect malicious code injection. But how does open source help the 99% of the population, that doesn't know how to build code, know they are using something that matches the open source code? From what you're saying it sounds like a malicious open source-er could fool 99% of people into using bad code

Sorry, I meant non-ARM. So Intel and AMD

Its not just ARM devices though. Its covers all Microsoft devices. And considering iOS does not allow Bitcoin apps, we are talking about the second largest ARM ecosystem (that allows Bitcoin apps) here, in addition to all the x86 devices this works on.

Doesn't sound like a "for the masses" solution. Plenty of people want the sense of security of using open source code, but don't know how to build the app themselves to check the hash.

WinRT is ARM and Intel. So essentially all Windows computers, tablets, phones, and maybe someday Xbox One

Couldn't one just open source the code, say that's the code the app is using, and then change the code the app is using to do something malicious? As long as the malicious developer doesn't check in the new code, no one would be the wiser. Is there a solution to this issue, or is open source really not all that helpful?

Multibit and Bitcoin-QT can only run on Windows 8 Intel-based computers. This is a WinRT app. That means all Windows 8 computers, Windows tablets, Windows Phone, and potentially Xbox One.

The Windows Store does have some benefits. Easy discoverability and installation of apps for less computer savvy users. A "for the masses" solution needs to be as simple as possible so the less technical 90% of the country can figure out how to get it working. Not to mention Microsoft tests all apps in its app store for malware, etc, so it seems safer to less technical users since things in the Windows Store are certified, while things "out there on the Internet" go through no certification process.
