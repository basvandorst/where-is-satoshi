This is what got me interested a while ago...

Blockchain based voting systems... And beyond.

This same subject came up earlier today...

No, really, if you're in Montreal you and are interested in bitcoin, then you owe it to yourself to go to the bitcoin embassy.
In the mean time, you can download the mycelium wallet for android (  ) and play around with it.

This reddit also discusses the matter...  
but,  I'm not sure how mycelium enables increasing the fee during a rebroadcast unconfirmed transaction. More research may be required...

This way? Somebody else being your other wallet.

It does seem like he's the modern Noah building his ark in the most surprising of places; it's good to be prepared for a flood though.

You may choose to rebroadcast as explained here:
The mycelium interface allows this operation when you select the transaction, but for the actual steps to take to do so, I don't have them in front of me... Maybe its on their site documentation

From the horses mouth, so to speak... Notice the user comment at the bottom... The comment he is making implies that the feature you are looking for is not currently available.

As a bitcoin noob, I've heard many many comparisons between gold and bitcoins, safe asset stuff et all, but this post woke me up to the fact that indeed bitcoin may be the new gold standard. So immediately started googling that premise and found that those ideas go back a few years already. 
After reading the articles, marketing pitches, etc...  one problem, in my mind, with bitcoin becoming the new gold standard became clear.. Bitcoin supersedes such standards. There us no reason to morph bitcoin into a gold standard replacement, because such standards are made unnecessary by bitcoin itself.

Millennials (also known as the Millennial Generation orGeneration Y, abbreviated to Gen Y) are the demographic cohort between Generation X and Generation Z. There are no precise dates for when the generation starts and ends; most researchers and commentators use birth years ranging from the early 1980s to around 2000.

The presentation of his idea struck me as historical revisionism, so no, I didn't much care for it. That being said, a white paper is a white paper so if he wants he can certainly present one for consideration.

It's just like Y2K !
