I think your conclusion is right but for the wrong reasons.  I don't think people's association between illegal activity and bitcoins is any weaker today than it was last week.  But in the future, we can point to the BTC exchange rate and say "two days after SR was shut down, the exchange rate was back where it was before DPR was arrested.  BTC is not reliant on illegal drug markets, and here's proof."
Silkroad's name will be as relevant in 10 years as Napster's name is today for illegal filesharing.  That is, not all that relevant.

Buyers don't need private keys to buy so this is irrelevant.

One could argue that even fewer users will use encryption if they know the site already has encryption.  Then in the case of a seizure or honeypot, even more users will be affected.
If native encryption can't be trusted (I don't know much about it but it sure sounds like it can't be!), then it seems useless to me.

Except they admitted to doing so in Ulbricht's affadavit.  Sold a fucking key of coke.

Contain no personal information.


Contain no personal information.


Have always been a bad idea and are impossible to be used securely.  Doesn't matter if the site is a honeypot or not, if you provide tracking to admins, you're asking for trouble.


Contain no personal information.


Everyone should be buying coins anonymously, or tumbling them before sending to a black market.


Irrelevant if your wallet is not linked to your identity.


Only necessary if you don't follow appropriate security steps.
I appreciate your points but the fact is, as long as PGP is secure, buyers and sellers have enough tools at their disposal to make secure transactions.

Sure but open source doesn't MEAN secure.  There'd be absolutely no way for me to know if, one day, you swapped everything going on behind the scenes to something that has no encryption, or has a huge backdoor, but produced the same HTML.
I don't want to judge this system based on a text description of a site and service I've never used.  But none of this information changes my opinion that native security cannot be trusted.  Sure, site owners should use it anyway.  But for a security minded user, it has absolutely no effect on how they should use the site.

How is a vendors profile encrypted? Buyer profiles?
Tracking is optional, and should not be used unless you explicitly trust the buyer.  The vast majority of SR sales did not use tracking.


Why would they need to be?  They contain no personal information if you're doing it right.
The fact is, unless the vendor is LE, or LE is able to change the vendor's PGP key at some point and you encrypt a message using a LE PGP because you don't check to make sure the PGP hasn't changed, you can safely use a site even if it is a honeypot as long as the seller legit and you always check the PGP key.

Can you explain why?
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:23:33
I'm not really sure what could possibly be trusted as proof that native encryption is enabled and secure.  Does your marketplace provide that, and if so, what does it look like?
Given that we only really see the HTML output of whatever backend stuff is going on, "we encrypt stuff" seems like about the best one could expect other than some spoofable encryption output.
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:35:25


No marketplace, honeypot or otherwise, will be safe if you don't use encryption.  It's an irrelevant argument.




Maybe I don't understand what you mean by native encryption, but I don't know a way to implement it that makes it possible to be able to see with absolute surety that it is encrypted to all parties except the intended recipient.
This discussion started because you suggested that there is loads of unencrypted sensitive information laying around on the SR servers.  I pointed out that if you simply use PGP correctly, this is not true.  It feels like you're moving the goalposts with this "majority of buyers don't use encryption" stuff.  Sure, there's unencrypted data floating around **if you personally put it there.**  So what?  As the OP stated, this won't happen if you simply use PGP and buy coins anonymously, or tumble them.  These are the most basic self preservation tactics you can take on any black market site, whether it is a honeypot or not.  It must always be assumed that anything you send unencrypted will end up in LE's hands.

Alternative black markets are exploding with SR refugees.  Nothing has changed with regards to bitcoins being used for buying drugs, except the website used to administer the exchanges.

Isn't this just a really vague, poorly-worded description of a 51% attack?
edit:  Read the paper itself, which describes this particular kind of attack as needing as little as 25%.  Interesting, I'd love to see someone more knowledgeable than myself about mining to analyze their findings.
