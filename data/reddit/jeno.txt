There is no point using bch, nothing against that coin but it’s an outdated technology , same can be said about btc hence why the developers are trying to advance the technology with off chain solutions, look at all other coins they are sooo more advanced against bch. So bch will be ignored anyways when the market actually mature. And the use cases will actually define what stays.

Lightning is made for btc to solve the scalability of the blocks . So it’s made for btc and sure can be used for all btc forks. Segwit is just a Minor update which helps the btc anyways. Optional or not it’s a method to solve a problem from outside the box. Like lightning. Now you have really to understand that btc or it’s forks behind the race in blockchain/or similar technologies , what btc has is it’s brand and adoption. So there is no reason to argue because in the end adoption and better technology will be used. And inferior coins will die in the end.

Gold is not used as a currency because it’s not efficient to move around. Hence the reason if paper than digital currency (ala banking system).

Well In the old times traders would write bonds that their country would ensure that the person have enough gold . Imagine a trader would goto from let’s say Andalusia and went to India he would not take all the gold with him so if he comes from an kingdom/empire that was known other traders would accept the bonds so paper at that time replaced the gold it self. Though through time many other factors played a role of course this was only one of many.

You do realize that lightning is not recommended because it’s still in beta phase. There are many active nodes but it’s still not secure . Atomic swaps still not adopted. Segwit still not adopted more than 30% . Honestly this will take years for everything to be adopted. I mean ffs bitcoin took 8 years for the media to understand it lol.
