Especially if you’re imagining a post-apocalyptic future where you’re trying to trade gold, it’s highly unlikely you’ll run in to anyone who needs multiple ounces to make electronics and dental crowns. Unless people were still hoarding gold for emotional reasons (and imo they would be), there would be waaaay too much available for anyone to worry.

This is true, but those uses are still accounting for the minority of gold purchased. The biggest price driver by FAR is investment.
And the second largest is jewelry, which is also at least partially “emotional” value.
If the demand for investment gold disappeared tomorrow, we’d have a massive glut and prices would plummet spectacularly.

People think bitcoin is going to be useless during a “societal collapse”, but don’t think about what “societal collapse” actually means.
I’d bet 1 whole bitcoin that San Francisco and Detroit have 5G infrastructure literally everywhere by 2025,  but SF will still have the second worst roads in the country and Detroit will still have over 1,000 homes without running water.
After hurricane Katrina, cell phone service was basically the first piece of destroyed infrastructure to be repaired. It was mostly back by the end of the week. 
Society is already partially collapsed, and Internet is only getting more pervasive. Be realistic about what “collapse” actually looks like and stop watching Walking Dead. It sucks. It’s just a soap opera with zombies.

I guess it depends who you’re trying to exchange with and the circumstances. Gold is also useless in lots of situations. Assuming there is no formal marketplace (probably only possible in a cliche pandemic scenario), you’d just be assuming gold/cash stirred up some serious emotions in your trading partner.
Because that’s the real value of gold/cash: the emotional value.

Like by all means, keep some canned food and copper just incase, but don’t forget to account for the 1,000 more likely scenarios where communication infrastructure still exists, but transportation and water infrastructure may be questionable in some regions.

If a societal collapse is so complete and destructive that it takes down the entire internet (or enough), then no currency is going to do you much good. Don’t make “total collapse” be your plan A. Maybe plan E, but it’s unlikely. Partial collapse is much more likely.

Anyone who thinks greed is a better price driver than utility: I got 20-ish people interested in BTC in 2016 when it was a useable currency. Have you tried explaining it to someone since mid 2017? For the average person, it sounds moronic and scammy to buy fake internet money that you CAN'T USE. And they're right, it's absolutely dumb. If we're not going to use BTC for transactions, just for "storing value", why even allow transactions at all? Let's just hard fork it so bitcoin can't move, ever. That makes sense.

Depends on how much faith you have in the institution of McDonalds.
