Segwit makes all transactions smaller, enables payment channels, and makes Bitcoin more secure but it is clear there is real need for more on chain transactions. A well though out and planed 2x should happen sooner rather than later imo.

I wasn't sure if your commented to discuss or to hate but it is clear now you commented just to hate. Sad

Some wallets support it but not a lot do unfortunately. I think most of the hardware wallets do. Some wallets like Electrum can use it if you import a BIP39 seed with a m/49'/0'/0' derivation path (highly technical way I know).

Any Bitcoin only (or Bitcoin first) company that adds Bcash before Bitcoin Segwit should be shamed/ boycotted imo.

Litecoin was created in 2011 to do what Bcash was created to do. Bcash had to steal Bitcoins name and user base to stand out. Litecoin has never pretend to be "the one rightful coin" or the best coin ever. I mean a common slogan has been "it's the silver to bitcoins gold."

Most people donate money they get for free if the feel they don't "need" it. If it calms down for him very soon then yea it's not really needed. I'm just trying to get Bitcoin some good pr or something.

The real killers for the cap are game downloads. What makes it worse is I am lucky enough to live in an area with a gigabit internet option but I can't just delete games I don't play and re download them because it is 60GB or more a game now.

It depends what area you are in. Most areas have 1TB data caps now.

I would run one but you know Comcast data caps :(

The scaling debate and infighting is why I didn't put a large amount of money into Bitcoin in 2015. Obviously I would have made a lot of money but all of the reasons I was scared of buying Bitcoin back then are true today.

I wanted to mine in 2011 but electricity in Hawaii was 45 cents a kwh so I didn't :(
