Which notable economists?
Your post is dumb. No one on this planet knows more about the price of Bitcoin than you or i. 
My prediction of 50 cent per coin in 20 years is just as valid as 100k by whatever "notable economist". 
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:46:03
I love how upset you are because your 0.5 coins hasn't made you rich yet and today will be yet another dissapointment. Your frustration is so obvious. And like the kid you are you blame it on everyone else but yourself. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:16:26
So OP, how many "cheap coins" are you currently buying? 10? 20?
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:13:05
Do a chargeback. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 06:18:17
A 18 year old bitcoiner, invested in Bitcoin, who thinks the price will keep going up. Yeah, he should follow your advice. What could possible go wrong. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:55:22
This time for real, right guyz?
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:12:04
Rational self-interest. Look it up. 
And then look up the free market. 
And then stop crying. 
If you can't handle this then sell your bitcoin and buy dollars or whatever. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:52:37
Please. Don't be ridiculous. That doesn't minimalise losses in any way. It's nothing but bitcoiner mental gymnastics. It's retarded. 
Whatever you do don't get your financial advise here. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:06:27
Riiiight. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:06:34
Price up? - fundamentals
Price down? - MANIPULATION!!1
@_date: 2017-08-06 06:16:24
Finally some common sense here. Instead of the usual "buy now and you will be rich" childish crap. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 09:17:15
SHOUT SOME MORE !!!11!
@_date: 2017-08-06 06:14:38
Your best advice is the dumbest advice. 
Because it worked until now that somehow means it keeps working indefinitely in your little fantasy world?
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:04:36
Mods, please start banning these dumbass posts and posters. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:00:27
Nobody knows. Because we can't predict the future. Stop asking. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:46:58
What? You type like a 12 year old. Unreadable. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:36:48
Solid explanation. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:54:56
And? What is this supposed to show?
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:50:25
Idiot. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:47:39
Between 1 and 100.000. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:14:38
Coinhouse? Where do you people keep finding all these companies?
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:27:44
A normal conversation about what? How you both want Bitcoin and a free market that isn't allowed to work against YOUR self-interest?
Sorry, no, not possible. 
You still don't get it, do you?
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:16:50
Piss off with these completely useless posts. 
The price might go down or up. Yeah, no shit. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:50:56
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:34:29
Wtf are you talking about? I own plenty. And i'm quite confident i bought them way before the majority of you kids. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 09:39:27
Ok thanks. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:54:49


These "stories" have been surfacing every other week since 2013. 
Get what i'm trying to say?
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:05:29
I thought bitcoiners loooove the free market? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:25:52
You can't predict Bitcoin performance. At least not more than a few hours ahead. Let alone years. Your post is one big cringe fest. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 06:15:12
Haha wtf? Source?
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:07:24
So we can add this event to the HUGE list of events that didn't take Bitcoin to the moon. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 06:13:03
Nobody knows. Stop asking. Nobody here can predict the future. 
Amazing the amount of people who think this is the case. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 08:06:35
Fuck, you're sad. I almost feel sorry for you. 
Keep "hodling" dude. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:20:41
Where was i rude?
@_date: 2017-08-07 08:35:26
Their ass. That's where these "smart people" are pulling those predictions from. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:06:19
Nobody knows. Stop asking. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:32:27
Uh no. And hilarious how you downvote all my replies. You really do have a problem with other opinions, don't you?
Maybe the internet isn't for you? 
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:47:12
None. 
This has been explained literally 100"s of times already. Use the search next time. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:15:39
Turned out to be some half assed scam. Just like pretty much any Bitcoin "project" out there. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:26:07
Haha what? You can't be serious?
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:21:03


Give me a break. This sub circle jerked 100's of times about "saving the poor" in Africa, Venezuela and 20 other places. Anything that could pump the price. 
And now that all failed we simply deny this happened? 
Disgusting. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:13:22
Nobody knows. Stop asking. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:23:08
The average age here is 15. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:56:16
Just stop with your word games. It's just sad. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 06:19:31
Really good. Sold high, bought back low, as usual. Probably around 20% increase in total last week. Why?
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:36:11
Where the hell did you get the idea that "everyone" moved their coins away from the exchanges?
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:45:43
Ask something that hasn't been asked 100 times before next time. And something that doesn't require a crystal ball. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:48:58
So i can put anything there and say it has lots of growth potential? Seriously, completely useless. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:50:22
Congrats on making your own meme shitpost. Where would this sub be without contributers like yourself. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:45:55
Notable economists? Seriously?
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:08:41
God, these posts. Please just stop. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 09:05:00
So when the expected price rise again didn't work out we just pull some mental gymnastics and start a circle jerk anyway?
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:14:50
Mweeeeh mweeeh someone in the free market behaves differently than i want mweeeeeh this isn't faaaaaair!
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:34:13
Uh what?
@_date: 2017-08-02 09:06:26
Where is it 450 and accepts coins deposits?
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:05:45
Nobody knows. Stop with these posts.
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:14:51
So why exactly does he need an account?
@_date: 2017-08-06 22:09:10
Post some more clickbait. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:34:04
"They don't do what i want so they are irrational". 
I can only assume you are very young. I actually hope that's the reason. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:38:27
Why don't you explain in your own words how they are "manipulating" the price?
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:23:34


Like Bitcoin you mean?
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:56:49
What part of my post didn't you understand? How old are you?
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:29:59
What a nice person you are. Don't blame me because your "hodl" strategy is a real bad decision. Blame yourself. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:46:34
@_date: 2017-07-24 07:51:38
Use the search. It's been asked literally 20 times a day for a month now. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:29:29
Yes it can crash. Don't be ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:53:42
Amazing strategy. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 11:41:46
So how many "cheap coins" did you buy already? At what prices? How much did you lose since then?
@_date: 2017-07-31 10:52:14
Nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:51:29
Yes, it's insane to watch. 
Most of these people are 20 year olds with half a coin who think they are professional investors. 
Their predictions are based on memes and dumbass buzzwords. 
Imagine a new person coming to this sub and the stuff he reads here. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:14:38
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:59:09
Highly unlikely. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:30:36
You're clueless about money, economics and how a business works. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:51:33
How many cheap coins are you currently buying? 
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:11:50
Because it might make the value of their bitcoin go down. That's all. 
If they had the power every single person here would've done what Jihan is doing if it means they will get rich easily. They're just pissed off they are on the wrong side. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:04:12
Use the fucking search! 
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:32:10
Yes what? How do you know? Bitcoin might drop to 200 dollars and stay there. Nobody knows. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:12:21
This time for real, right? 
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:19:07
it's really nasty to make such wild claims just to get noobs to buy. You have no clue if the price will go to 5000 or 200. Both are very possible. You're just as bad as those who spread FUD. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:55:40
I wish the mods would remove these dumbass posts. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:43:52
Look up the words sarcasm and figure of speech. Let me know if you need any help
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:21:04
Please stop with your cringey shit. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:53:53
Manipulating what???
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:28:01


Oh ok. Amazing feature.  
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:26:53
Stop these all-caps shitposts please. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:27:57
Those people don't know shit. I can't believe you believe random people like they can see into the future. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:02:32
Not really. Just common sense. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 06:27:15
I can't believe you actually typed that. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:34:31
So how much did you buy today? Or do you just want others to buy to pump the price and make your coins, which you bought cheaper, become worth more?
Nah, nobody here would do such a thing. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:38:00
You have no clue if this will happen. Stop pretending you can look into the future. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:35:13
So how many cheap 2700 dollar coins did you just buy?
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:52:08
People trading. Like they did the last 5 years. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:23:00
Nobody knows. All opinions are worthless so stop asking. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:21:59
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:43:36
Because of the childish "buy the dip" meme new people might think everyone here is buying like crazy during a crash. I can guarantee you this is not the case. 
It's simply a tactic to get noobs to buy at these high prices to get the price back up. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:26:00
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:14:28
Cringe. 
When people use this quote you just know they are totally clueless about trading. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:12:49
You sold but are telling others to buy? How nice of you. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 07:49:26
And? What's your point? You found one currency that is less stable than Bitcoin. Is that worth all the circle jerking in this thread?
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:39:06
Right. This time for real guyz!
@_date: 2017-07-29 05:34:51
Nobody fucking knows! Stop asking every 5 mins ffs!
@_date: 2017-07-29 07:44:21
Totally irrelevant. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 09:26:34
A bitcoiner who thinks it's time to buy. Ok. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:57:45
A shill for what???
Seriously, answer me me you moron. A shill for what??
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:25:45
How is it that the average bitcoiner has so much trouble understanding even the basics of economics? How old are you?
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:03:17
I was correcting you. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 12:19:43
How many "cheap coins" did you buy? 10? 20?
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:37:41
Riiiight. Keep telling that yourself. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 18:46:43
Get a life. Pathetic. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:20:33
Yes. What could possibly go wrong!
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:26:34
How much did you buy? And how much have you lost since then?
@_date: 2017-07-10 18:43:41
5 million is absolutely nothing. Clickbait title. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 11:05:55
You "invested" 12 dollars?
@_date: 2017-07-16 14:33:38
Same question for you. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 11:01:15
Uh what? 
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:09:46
How do you know this wouldn't hurt over time?? Your crystall ball told you so? Your chicken bones maybe?
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:50:20
You have to be extremely greedy and stupid to let them lock your coins. IF they scam you, you deserved it. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 07:51:38
Nobody knows. Stop asking. Please. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:36:11
How the hell do you know if he has solid gains next year? Stop trying to trick noobs into buying with nonsense claims about guaranteed profits. Kids like you make this thing look like a ponzi. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 11:18:24
If that other account was not yours then how do you know about the 4000 dollar connected to that account?
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:14:06
Where do all you fools find these things?
Of course they are a scam. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:10:54
As always: nobody on this planet knows. Stop asking. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:04:36
Yeah bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:20:34
What zone? What systems will lock up?
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:45:17
How do you know?
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:44:22
This is the worst place to ask for obvious reasons. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:19:45
I sold at 2600 and will buy back when we reach the bottom. 
You're insane if you think nobody will sell their coins back to me. 
Fact is you're shitting your pants by "hodling" and now try to spread ridiculous FUD because you don't want others to sell. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:48:17
How do you know? Your crystal ball told you so?
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:24:14
Jesus Christ. How old are you?
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:38:45
What expected dip??
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:15:11
Holding for the long term IS gambling. Stop pretending it's anything else. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 10:25:40
How euphoric are you in this moment?
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:46:53
There aren't any. It's just a stupid meme in a sub full of kids. Do what you think is best. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 09:22:38
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:42:20
Oh right. My bad. That sure proves it's guaranteed then. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:32:33
It can rally 100%. Or 0%. Why even post this crap. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 18:47:29
It could see anything. Nobody knows. These articles are pointless. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:30:22
You Nostradamus you. I assume you just took out a massive loan to go all in?
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:28:15
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:15:51
Troll post. 
People who trade such amounts don't come to a meme sub asking for advice. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:49:33
My point is that you're tricking noobs into buying while you simply have no clue what the price will do in the future. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 10:43:24
I wish this ridiculous buy the dip meme would be killed. 
Fact is that every one of you idiots who post this shit are NOT buying any dip and just want others to buy so the price recovers and you can stop shiiting your pants. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:09:15
Guess what. We can't look into the future. 
Never listen to anyone on this sub about what to do with YOUR money. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:07:29
No other option? What?
I'm done reading your delusional nonsense. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:09:10
Idiot. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:36:42
Oh right. Well, then it's no problem. 
Let the circle jerk continue. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:58:33
Because Bitcoin is so stable and can't crash right?
These posts are delusional. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:01:52
I wonder how euphoric you were if you bought the "dip" at 2800 or any other number up there which is always an amaaaazing sale. 
You got lucky, that's all. None of these kids here have a clue if the price will back up again after going down. 
Neither did you so stop acting if you're some big time trader. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:02:43
Huh? No. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:47:46
How many "cheap coins" did you buy? 20? 50?
@_date: 2017-07-28 07:54:00


Stop this shit. You have no fucking clue if it will. You are tricking noobs into buying by pretending you can predict the future. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:34:23
Wth are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:08:15
You should come to a sub like this full of moon kids asking for financial advice of course. This place is filled with trading experts. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:23:02
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:57:47
Huh? How the hell do you know? 
@_date: 2017-07-10 18:44:38
Stop thinking you will get free money. You won't. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:24:14
I love how this sub celebrates how nobody uses Bitcoin. And even suggests you should not use it. But when a company drops their Bitcoin payment options because nobody uses it everyone here goes bat shit crazy. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:29:16
Yeah let's pick the shittiest currency on earth, compare it to Bitcoin and then make claims how much better Bitcoin is. 
How old are you?
Why not compare it to let's say the Euro? Oh wait, i know why. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:24:39
No sorry. If you want cheap and instant transactions you should use Paypal. 
Aaaaand downvoted. Hilarious. Someone's upset. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:25:50
"Wallstreet is about to buy in"
This sub in 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:34:34
I wonder how many more years bitcoiners will get their panties in a bunch because someone said something bad about Bitcoin. Don't you people get tired of this stuff?
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:34:06
Oooh. Right. Mass adoption any time soon now. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:28:58
Edgy as hell!
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:09:10
Do you realize it's thanks to the traders out there and not the "hodlers"?
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:46:52
I see. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:25:52
How the hell are we supposed to know?
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:32:32
But this sub told me the dip was last week at 2300. 
Anyway, how much did you buy so far and how much did you lose since then?
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:28:30
Just like the 178 previous times we were about to go to the moon because of reasons. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:32:47
Stop lying. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:38:11
How are we supposed to know exactly?
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:20:25
You took out a loan to buy a shitload i assume? 
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:40:37
Tbh if he is young then you sound even way younger. I'd say about 15. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 11:40:04
You tried to buy shady shit. You were greedy. In the process you got scammed. Nobody cares. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:39:10
How? By who? Give me some examples. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:35:13
Nah, i was already all-in at 2900 when people here told me it was amaaaazing time to buy because we would hit 3000+ in hours. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:29:27
Nobody knows. Stop asking!

Bitcoiners love the free market. Just not when it takes the price down. Then the free market is a horrible thing. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:59:44
You have no idea if he will make profit. Don't pretend you know the future. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:24:17
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:52:08
Go ask 10 random normal people out in the real world if it makes sense and report back please. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:22:01
You have no idea if it is. Stop spreading nonsense. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:15:23
Ridiculous logic based on nothing. . 
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:29:56
Sure you did. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:16:54
The begging in this thread is fucking sickening. 
This sub attracts the lowest of the lowest. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:21:36
Nobody knows. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:46:26
This place is filled with kids who own 0.2 and think they will be loaded in the near future. They constantly try to pump the price and try to get others to buy in. 
Of course everyone here is shouting all day long that the price will go up. 
You're even more dumb than those kids if you believe them. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:13:04
No answer. Surprising. 
Idiots. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:48:17
I sold at 2700 and will buy back in when the time is right. 
But i wish i was a smart as you "hodlers". 
@_date: 2017-07-09 15:32:53


Nobody knows. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:39:41
Yeah right. You must've missed the slogan of this sub: "hodl". 
Bitcoiners don't use Bitcoin. 
They of course want others to use it though while they "hodl". 
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:56:49
This sub told me last week at 2300 was an amaaaaazing time to buy. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:52:39
Why? What will happen long term?
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:34:21
Bitcoin can't go down, right?
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:42:44
Learn to read. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:44:53
Look kid, i own Bitcoin but i live in reality. 
Ready to compete with the euro? You are completely totallly fucking delusional. Move away from this sub and get some meds. Your behaviour is very unhealthy. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:48:35
Nobody knows. Stop asking. We can't look into the future. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:51:59
And this will happen sometime soon, right?
And only Bitcoin "hodlers" will survive. Correct?
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:09:51
People selling. What don't you understand about that?
It's odd how people here always get confused when the price goes down. As if that's not possible or something. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 10:47:23
Let me guess. You and everyone else here are extremely delighted the price is going down because you will scoop up all these "cheap coins"? Am i close?
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:44:50
Ah poor kiddo is upset when the evil traders take the price down. Awwww. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:20:01
You're insane if you think Bitcoin has 15 million users. Completely delusional. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:02:05
Why don't you use the search?
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:16:39
"Hodling" as the broke teens call it is just as much gambling as trading is. Bitcoin might crash next week and never recover. Nobody fucking knows. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:15:42
What a load of shit. 
No, the price going down is not good for anything. Everyone is shitting his pants. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 06:27:41
No. they used real money. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:38:05
So you mean pretty much everyone in this sub?
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:30:30
Do you understand the word safe?
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:08:33
Stop making me cringe. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:09:59
How many did you buy? 10? 20?
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:35:31
You know this sub has been saying that for years now, right?
But this time it will really happen?
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:17:41
Most sold at a way lower price. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 15:58:38
Move to the desert. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 10:44:06
SWIM just cringed. What year is this?
Please never use that word again. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:18:32
Do people seriously fall for this stuff??
@_date: 2017-07-19 08:23:40
Yeah. Billions will be using your service. 
Hilarious. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:40:10
Nobody knows. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:04:34
And when is fiat gonna "crash" exactly? What does that even mean? All fiat will be worth nothing or something?
And i don't downvote. It's probably other people who think your posts are dumb. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:13:26
Take the hint. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:05:35
Nothing. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:15:32
I see you're having a tough time if the circle jerk fails. 
Funny how that makes me "an ass". 
@_date: 2017-07-16 14:36:11
In reality you didn't buy anything and are totally shitting your pants like everyone else here. 
These posts are pure desperation. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:31:14
Nobody knows. We can't look into the future. 
And the fact you need someone else's advice to "invest" 20 bucks is scary. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:05:53
What's stopping them? Common sense and living in reality. Unlike you. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:10:47
Still not guaranteed. No matter how autistic you are. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 10:41:40
Just call everyone who has a different opinion or doesn't think Bitcoin will hit 300k by next year a troll. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:12:00
This sub has to be one of the most immature subs on Reddit. Unbelievable. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:57:50
Nobody knows. Because we can't predict the future. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:00:55
Hilarious. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:31:58
People trading you mean?
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:29:36
How the hell would anybody here know?
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:27:40
How exactly are they manipulated? You mean people are trading?
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:42:43
Right. And then you will be picking up all these "cheap coins"!
Stop lying. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:41:15
Yeah his reply made me cringe hard. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:24:30
He was 100% serious. How is my critic ridiculous exactly? Please explain. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:59:33
Correct. I sold at 2600. And will buy back near the bottom. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 10:01:51
You must be filthy rich by now, right?
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:00:00
Most of the times, yes. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:13:42
You should read the posts of the 200 people before you who asked exactly the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:22:49


So only then? Not if you deposit after?
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:06:03
Jesus Christ. So much effort for 1 small time scam. One of 1000's in the crypto space. You have too much free time. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 07:45:35


Go all in then


@_date: 2017-07-28 17:08:02
You know nothing more than anyone else here. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:01:43
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:26:29
Because of traders your 0.2 bitcoin is now worth more. You should thank these people. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 10:45:15
Post more memes. I'm sure big time investors will see the maturity and professionalism of the Bitcoin crowd and jump right in because they want to be part of it. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:13:36
Please ban this stupid gif and the teens posting it. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:58:42
Nobody knows. Because we can't predict the future. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:50:12
You have no idea if it will go up again in 2 weeks. Stop pretending you know the future. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:49:41
So people trading? Buying low, selling high? That is manipulation??
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:15:46
Because he really has to prove himself to a sweaty anon neckbeard demanding shit from his bedroom. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:37:03
No, it's not guaranteed whatsoever. How do you people come up with this nonsense. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 11:41:05
By participating in a another scam. He got greedy. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:26:44
Crazy how people somehow expect the price to just go up. Like it's impossible it can go down. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:31:03
Oh look, another Nostradamus! How many millions did you make trading yet?
@_date: 2017-07-29 08:27:28
If everybody knew this already the price would be tanking already. Fact is nobody knows so the price is "stable". 
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:19:09
Blah blah blah 
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:39:48
Or the dollar comes back and Bitcoin crashes. Nobody knows. Everything is possible. 
Also there is nothing safe about Bitcoin. Stop calling it a safe haven. It's the most ubsafe investment i can think of. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:49:38
Oh look Nostradamus here. 
How big is the loan you took to go all-in? I mean what could possibly go wrong!
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:53:18
And Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:11:02
I was joking but i love how easy it is to trigger you people. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:21:54
So traders trading and taking profits? Yeah, crazy manipulation. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:37:07


I wonder how many posts we'll see about coins "dissapearing". 
Of course, like anything Bitcoin related, this will attract scammers from all over the place. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:31:01
How old are you people making such ridiculous claims?
We could go under 2000 an hour from now. Stop pretending you can predict the markets. You can't. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:14:21
What a load of shit. Bitcoin could go down tomorrow and stay down. Then all your nonsense will be just that. Nonsense. 
Nobody fucking knows what the price will do in the future. The past price does not guarantee the future in any way. Stop spreading this bullshit. It looks like you're selling a ponzi. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 14:29:19
Does this look like a Steam support site to you?
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:27:13
A single bullshit tweet can cause this. Traders panic extremely easily. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 19:53:16
So do i. I jist don't tell noobs to invest because nothing can go wrong. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:05:17
And 99% here would do the same thing if they could. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:16:50
Because one person has some ads on his car it's "alive and well" in South Africa?
Edit: it's probably a scam as well. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:17:33
Yeah, i also have this plan. 
Hilarious. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:08:23
How many coins did you just buy?
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:29:47
Highly delusional as i said. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:27:48
People selling. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 09:39:21
How do you know? You have a crystal ball?
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:11:48
A bitcoiner who is invested in bitcoin on a bitcoin sub is claiming now is a good time to buy. Yeah ok. 
I saw EXACTLY the same posts at 2000, 2500 and 2900 and everything in between. That worked out well for those noobs taking "advice" from this sub. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:49:19
Nobody knows where it will go. One big dump and we're at 1900 again and OP will quietly dissapear or post some stupid meme about "cheap coins". 
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:33:00
Still waiting. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:22:31
I can't believe you typed a story that long to explain you got scammed at some shitty casino no sane person would touch. They are all scams. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:37:16
Stop spreading FUD! You, like everyone else, have no fucking idea where the price will go!
You obviously have an agenda. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:26:27
Don't count on it. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:28:49
Uhm wow. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:06:42
Pull what plug soon?
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:34:12
Post it here. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:39:40
That's some serious mental gymnastics there kiddo. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:31:41
Because the rest of the world doesn't use Bitcoin? You really couldn't figure that out?
I'm into Bitcoin since 2013 and have not met a single person who actually uses it. Ever. 
Doing a kickstarter directly with Bitcoin is just asking for trouble. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 17:53:58
No. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 19:05:39
You have absolutely no idea if it will. Like everyone else. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:58:52
Nobody knows. Stop asking. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 07:35:21
Hilarious how Bitcoiners want to "hodl", expect business owners to adopt Bitcoin and demand discounts. 
Yeah, mainstream adoption any time now. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 18:39:46


No. Get over it. Nobody knows. You won't get rich that easy. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 08:29:29
Guess what? We can't see into the future. Yeah, crazy. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 00:57:34
It is quite hilarious that the end goal for pretty much any bitcoiner is to sell it for fiat. But i guess the irony is lost on most here. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 11:12:07
Yeah crazy feeling. I remember thinking the same thing 15 years ago with Paypal. The money just appeared it my account. It was mind blowing. The only difference though it was instant. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:46:52
Again, you can't predict the future. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:27:43
Price up - fundamentals
Price down - manipulation
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:03:40
No thanks. I just sold everything at 2600. And will buy back lower. Crazy strategy, i know. But look into it. It might work better. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:34:57
Essential in every portfolio?? I doubt it is in even 0.1%. How delusional are you. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 09:36:29
So how did it happen?
@_date: 2017-07-17 11:07:38
Observations based on nothing but hope and rainbows are far from brilliant. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:07:10
What part don't i understand?
@_date: 2017-06-29 18:32:23
Why would anybody here be able to answer that? If that person could look into the future he would be busy making billions and not be here in this sub. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:09:28
Maybe you should calm down with the entitlement a bit. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 03:19:23


What experience? You didn't post shit. Just begging for money. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:36:14
Price going up? Fundamentals!
Price going down? Manipulation omggg!
