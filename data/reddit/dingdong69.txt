hes not wrong, bitcoin got no use anymore.
even Lightning network is outdated.
So bitcoin got its use when silkroad was in use, now a days more and more dark-shops shifts to monero.
So there bitcoin looses a leg, and thats a big leg.
So whats bitcoins uses, ?
p2p transactions?
there are already fee less coins.
Only use will be sending from one exchange to another one, but only from worthless exchanges that dosnt lets ju use anohter cheeper coin to send from exchange to exchange.
and i believe in the future more and more we will se fiat pair whit more and more cryptos.
So i would say bitcoin have to get fee less or others will take over.
because in the end everyone will use a free one to send over one that costs to send.
And i dont really belive bitcoin is so much decentralized any more because there is like 3-4 major miners that more or less controlls bitcoins nowadays.
i know i will get downvoted as fuck, but this i my opinion and love what bitcoin have supplied this world with, but as any blockchain, its so much more easy to creat a new one over fixing an existing one, and that will be bitcoins death, and other old ones.
pretty sure more people think like me.
