ETH is not a coin! It is decentralised computer that runs kitty app. It doesn't compete with BTC.  Has no market cap and no use except making Vitalik rich AF.

People start waking up. Wonder how much time it will take them to actually start buying?

Thx Roger and Jihan for possibility to increase my BTC holdings by 13% before this bull run. I took it directly from Rogers pocket (viaBTC). You are the best Roger!!!

My friend is up to his nose in onecoin. I tried to explain him what is blokchain and why bitcoin is decentralised. But he just pour  Marketing bullshit with no knowledge of technical aspects. Some ppl are beyond saving.

Soon I will join the fight with my full node BIP 148. Jihan will soon find out who is in charge of the network.

Im in. My node with BIP 148 should go live today. I was never planing to run a full node but recent development forced me to do it. UASF or bust. I don't want another central fiat money controlled by politician and Business.

Great to hear Luke been interviewed but the quality of this interview is damnable. I think I could do better and I never interviewed anybody. Kudos to Luke for the patience.
