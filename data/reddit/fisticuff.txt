Just use paypal or bank and save yourself the effort.

The man deserves it, this warms the heart.

One reason is it is against the law. Also, they could be buying in to go long. If the prevailing view was that that price would rise significantly after the futures, it would explain the buying pressure now.

The interviewer seems to be a bit of a toss bag.

It really is an outrage that a scam site can be top of a Google search.

Relax brother. Baby steps. A snowball takes time to build momentum. I am always happy to hear such criticism of bitcoin, as it's ill conceived and lacks the lateral out of the box thinking to understand where bitcoin is heading. 
If these concerns you outlined were the only problems bitcoin faced, it would indeed be going to the moon.

Regardless, his point of being suspicious of banks and not wanting to ever use them is fair.
@_date: 2014-11-05 10:32:54
More info please.

At least he put the disclaimer "I could be wrong" when dismissing bitcoin.
Still, I would rather he was honest and say he has no idea.

How many big macs could you buy in 2000 with your $10? How many can you buy today? This would give you a better answer.
Edit: in Australia $2.19 in 2000. $4.95 today.

Delete everything and comply. Then sit back and think of another angle, a different angle. Then get involved again when you come up with this brilliant plan. Better then shitting yourself everyday.

I think Andreas creamed in his pants there at the end, when the dude suggested he'd recommend 5 years of no regulation.
@_date: 2014-04-19 00:22:30
Excellent, thank you.
@_date: 2014-09-21 08:58:01
You paid the PayPal fees, as they are embedded in the price of the product.

Don't try to beat me at grammar you will loose.

Someone ask him if he can accept bitcoin for payment. I am very interested!

Gimme gold. Gimme it.

Never had a tip, would like to check it out.

Take a chill pill.  If you're not laundering you won't be targeted.

Well, we do live in a democracy, even though that may be a facade. The fact is there are proper practices to follow through the legal system, which would make it hard for a democratic country to quickly ban it in such a way. 
Court system, publicity, political talking heads getting involved etc, makes it very unlikely to be banned as you suggest. It may well become a fuel to the bitcoin fire.
@_date: 2014-11-02 09:07:27
Makes sense, thank you.
@_date: 2014-07-28 13:17:38
If a country (e.g. China) wanted to destroy bitcoin, could they do it?
@_date: 2014-06-11 13:57:26
Nobody could have possibly hatched that scheme.

I was thinking, when u sell on coinjar you get 10% extra on your price from gst. Is this a simple arbitrage opportunity? Buy from independent reserve, sell on coinjar?

Its growing acceptance as a store of value is what will see it reach great heights. This ties on with 1 and 9 in the list.

Thank you very much for this link. It has been an incredible read. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:36:56
Agree, probably less then 1%.

Could these spam attacks be from the pro raising the blocksize camp?

He was referring to the USA choice of bombing or not bombing, I think.  This would make the analogy work better.

Cheers. Thanks for the reply.

6 blokes behind closed doors in New York coming up with an agreement,  motivated by personal gain is my idea of consensus. I am with you erik.

You must understand that bitcoin is the greatest form of money that humans have ever producud. In the history of civilization. The greatest form of money by a long margin. 
Once you can get your head around that, you will understand why it could "moon".

No, s2x was cobbled together in quick fashion to get in before UASF, so as to claim it activated segwit. UASF got segwit activated.

" It's quickly coming to the point (imho) that damage of continual impasse being worse than dangerous deployments like bip148. "
Disagree with this. Bitcoin is still working and will continue to work. Dangerous deployments should be avoided at all costs. 
Store of value is Bitcoins major acomplishment. The segwit benefits would be fantastic, but not worth risking damage to bitcoins core business, that being a store of value.

But there are no dishes to wash with bitcoin. I am struggling to come up with a way to involve women.

Maybe when nail polish is low, an app will automatically order you more, via bitcoin technology. This is something women would be VERY interested in.
@_date: 2016-07-04 07:31:13
Have you considered it's potential as a store of value?
