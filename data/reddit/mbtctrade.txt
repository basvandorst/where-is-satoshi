I don't think its currency specific. I tried to withdraw DOGE and the transaction has been pending for about 24 hours despite what they mention on their website that the transaction will be approved within 30 minutes. Also their support never reply to my email. Do not trade with [btctrade.im](

Just want to share my experience so that other users might be aware of potential fiat withdrawal problem with CEX.IO. The first fiat withdrawal may be ok but you might experience increasing delay with consecutive withdrawals. The response from support is also really slow.
I have been trading with CEX.IO for about a month now. So far I have made three fiat withdrawal requests. The first one was on 29 August 2017. The withdrawal request was reviewed and completed by CEX.IO staff within 24 hours and the money was credited to my bank account 7 working days later. I asked my bank about the normal period for processing international wire transfer and they said that it usually take 2 - 7 working days. So this first request was fine.
However, my 2nd fiat withdrawal request (which was made on 11 September 2017) and the money was supposed to be credited to my bank account by 20 September 2017 but, as of today - 22 September 2017, I still have not received the money. Today I contacted my bank and they stated that there was no incoming transaction. I sent a ticket to the support team and they said that they have escalated the issue to the compliance department. Still have not received any words from the compliance team.
My 3rd fiat withdrawal was even worse. I made a request on 14 September 2017 and the request is still pending. Meaning it has not been reviewed and completed by the finance department. I have issued a ticket to support on 16 September 2017 and what I received from the support team was they had escalated this matter to the concerned department. It has been about 8 days since I made the withdrawal request but the status is still pending (note that the first two requests were reviewed and completed within 24 hours) and no further feedback form support or concerned department.
Now I'm concern about my 2nd and 3rd withdrawals. And my 4th withdrawal (if any) will take even longer than the 3rd one. I'm not sure if I should continue to use CEX.IO services.

Same here. I can't log on to their platform. Looks like there system is down. No activities e.g. bid, ask, last, on their front page.
