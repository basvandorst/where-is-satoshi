What step does one take to legally start a private firm for crypto trading
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:36:38
And use the $50 a day towards an insane electric bill
 -_- 
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:09:41
I love using that exchange over the other options although the only potential downside is you’re limited to BTC and ETH only...which is fine with me personally. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 08:49:30
It isn’t a flamethrower its a glorified propane torch
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:26:24
I think it’s way too early to be posting this but one day it might be a reality
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:25:21
Cold storage is the option, do you even read? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:41:24
Bitcoin is for smart people, and I’m not talking high IQ here...
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:59:32
Lol 15.6k on gemini at the same time
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:48:55
Yet insanely stupid people throw their money into the stock market anyway don’t they? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:00:55
Why the hell are these idiots setting such low fees, if you want a transaction done then pay for it...simple. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:39:46
The answer to your question is technically yes, but defeats the purpose of DCA 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:39:21
You could have also actually plugged your arcade and told us where the hell it is located at jeez....
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:05:51
It’s been 2 minutes remove this trash of a contribution 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:34:06
I love both bitcoin, and snowboarding and I would always choose a shred trip over an investment that could potentially shit the bed...
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:20:24
Lol someone hack this piece of shit now, don’t say you haven’t been warned. Heh! 
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:28:08
Ah aha ha I don’t know what OP expected here...but yeah. Spending a big chunk of your ‘getting by’ money is not only stupid but not supposed to really be a plausible thing in one’s situation such as yours
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:03:49
Banks report anything over 5k, or suspicious activity like 5 1k deposits in a 24 hour period.
I’d love to not pay taxes either but I think they are classified as capital gains. I’d figure how is the IRS going to go after everyone who profits off crypto, they have yet to set a precedent so maybe you can get away with a lot at the moment, who knows? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:21:13
This one’s right
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:01:18
You don’t always have to buy a lot at once, go ahead and buy but maybe put in less than you normally do/would
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:05:18
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:43:54
Back when you could click those stupid ads on the dark web that gave you free BTC I had a decent amount built up but destroyed the computer that held the info on the address 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:52:13
Fuck man, the IRS is probably creating a branch or team just to go after those who’ve gotten rich off Crypto 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:23:12
Lol if you need quick money for a holiday sell all your bitcoin and do something else to net you small and insignificant yet possibly quick gains
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:16:55
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:34:16
You’re an idiot OP
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:16:49
Good Question, I’ll be patiently waiting for an answer as well! 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:11:10
Lol they weren’t getting pot on the silk road that was primarily for harder stuff and anything much harder to procure than pot. And most of those purchases led to an increase in overall wealth a lot of the time...
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:44:58
I do
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:21:15
I’m not mad about it but I don’t understand why the price is increasing so quickly...I know it’s supposed to increase, but got damn this is fast
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:16:49
 Buy my 8plus for btc we got a deal
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:24:42
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:59:52
If that happens the rest of us will double down during this “flippening” dip
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:03:49
For what a jolly good fellow
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:57:50
^^^Seriously, I saw an article that claimed the 4.3% drop in price from one day to the next meant certain doom
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:46:23
@_date: 2017-09-09 13:04:17
I was 19 when I discovered bitcoin, I was unemployed and had little savings...wish I dumped them into BTC back then but now I'm 24 and I'm buying up $100-$500 at a time now.
@_date: 2017-09-20 03:25:45
Go in with your daily/weekly/monthly limit and then transfer your coins to cold storage and forget about it...ten/twenty years down the line sell what you wish for a nice return. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:36:59
Leave and never return here
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:00:55
My savings was only $200 back then lol so I'd probably be in the same boat as I am now if it went south...but because it didn't go south I'd be in a better spot financially. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 04:45:51
Saw 8999.99 on gemini
@_date: 2017-10-02 05:28:58
there have been many threads asking the exact same questions, it would be nice if you used to search function there are some great answers already provided. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:06:45
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:40:50
Myself and everyone I personally know off of the internet who had BTC sold because of the uncertainty with the coming fork,
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:28:55
You answered your own question in the subject...cold storage is the safest...yes exchanges are still getting hacked or can take your coins without explanation...
@_date: 2018-02-25 03:37:43
Except he doesn’t even know where the cold storage wallet is...
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:44:21
