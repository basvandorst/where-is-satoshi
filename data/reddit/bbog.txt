Another thing...dunno if you plan on doing this or not, but if you order the card too, I recommend you buy some btc either when price goes down or now, and then wait until price recovers or its value goes above your entry point, and then start spending. Free money practically xD
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:30:46
Yea because you can sell crypto for $ to your ledger . Thanks, omg, you've blown my mind, how did I not think about this before
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:14:34
A lot of people here on reddit are very radical when it comes to BTC. There was a possibility BTC would fork last month, you had 2 sides : core and 2x. supported core.
On one hand le bitcoiners redditors were trashing Xapo because of their 2x fork support, on the other hand they were praising Coinbase for their services, despite the fact that Coinbase was supporting 2x as well. 
Hypocrisy or idiocy - you decide.
Bottom line is, if you only care about the services Xapo offers, they're good, you should'n worry too much.

Why are you giving irrelevant advice
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:28:17
It happened to me as well. 
They disabled my account after I sold 2k worth of BTC for USDT because of some verification issue? Dunno, never found out why. 
Sent them 3 messages, I only received 1 automatic reply so far, so I have no idea wtf is going on.
Request 
LE: They replied and reopened my account last night. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:49:58
Why is it that price charts show bitcoin is worth $300-$400 but when you go coinjar, they're selling it for $650/btc ?
@_date: 2016-06-21 10:40:23
Yea, that looks dodgy from an AML point of view. 
Just try to explain what you said in your post and try to comply to their requests to provide as much proof as possible, and I reckon you should be fine

Search for 'bitcoin' in your email accounts. To buy coin u usually need to register somewhere, using an email... so you should still have some sort of communication in your inbox
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:12:43
Is no one going to talk about OP's reddit account?

Haha agree. Who knows, let's see how this plays out. It might be just a rumor and nothing else
@_date: 2016-06-20 13:04:35

No it doesn't boil down to your simple and frankly quite stupid conclusion. 
"Sources: Many readers have asked that I provide third party citations to ‘prove’ the NSA identified Satoshi using stylometry. Unfortunately, I cannot as I haven’t read this anywhere else—hence the reason I wrote this post. **I’m not trying to convince the reader of anything, instead my goal is to share the information I received and make the reader aware of the possibility that the NSA can easily determine the authorship of any email through the use of their various sources, methods, and resources."**
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:40:36
There's no proof, that's for sure. So take this with a grain of salt
The original [tweet](
Also, it's how J K Rowling's pseudonym was uncovered, so [it has been done before]( 
Calling bullshit just because you're skeptical doesn't make it any less probable that the NSA might have uncovered Satoshi's identity.
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:00:45
Electrum. Free and you only have to secure your seed to keep your BTC safe. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:07:34
2x is not gonna happen. They don't have more than 2-3 developers on their side, who will write the code? 
Even if it's not official yet, nobody will support 2x, you'll see.
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:02:21
How? What if your trezor/ledger burns?
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:37:55
Boy, you sure showed him! You addressed all his concerns in a very precise way, great argument, great reply!
Uhhh uhhhh mmmuh muh bitcoin muh lightnigng netweork *drooling* 
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:13:47
Just use Electrum, it's free, save the seed, give one copy to your mom or dad or brother or someone you trust, keep one yourself, and you should be ok. 
Depends how much btc you have as well
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:48:23
I'll probably just stop following BTC related news in November.

What happens if you lose your precious hdd wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:17:30
Just follow these two basic rules of BTC
1. DO NOT SPEND MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE
2. HODL - DO *NOT* SELL

Going back to my original reply, why the fuck should I spend my money on a ledger or the other one when I can do the exact same shit with any other free e-wallet??????????

OP already said he didn't root his phone, so your reply is just you rambling
@_date: 2017-09-08 11:18:35
Segwit2x will not happen. It's not official yet, but think about it.. there's no 2x code yet, they don't have enough developers on their side (only 2 or 3 IIRC) and there's only 2 months left till this supposed fork. 
Who's going to write the code? Who's going to test? When???
It's not going to happen. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:45:38


There was no major crisis so far, to test this. So far, BTC can easily be mistaken for a huge ponzi scheme. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm still a fan, I just hope people (the markets) find a use for it, be it a paypal killer type of internet payment method, or storage of value, or remittance of money, anything really... 
So far I don't see how BTC is anything else but a common bucket full of money. Which is not bad, as long as it doesn't spill at the first big bump in the road
@_date: 2017-09-12 09:58:15


I think this is the real test for BTC. If people keep holding even during hard times, BTC will become the new 'savings account' for a lot of people. 
If everyone sells when things start looking bleak, then BTC is rendered useless. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:36:56
But those are not free...

OP is asking if Xapo is worth it or it sucks, that's it. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 06:37:15
You must be new around here
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:04:59
I believe [this]( is the transaction
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:39:15
There seems to be a systematic phishing attack going on against these crypto services. I remember a month (more or less) ago, blockchain.info was targeted, then very recently xapo.com and now shapeshift. 
I'm willing to bet it's the same people behind all these attacks
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:36:52


They didn't say that. They said they will follow the chain with the most proof of work. 
If you can't understand simple English, then maybe you should improve your comprehension skills and then have strong opinions like this one you just regurgitated above.
@_date: 2017-10-11 10:41:09
No, he's just stupid.
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:48:45
This can happen in Europe as well. If you have more than 10k on you, don't declare it and get caught...you're in trouble.

Get their debit card, which is linked to your wallet.
You can either withdraw £ from ATMs or you can just use your card to do purchases.
