If we're to actually believe that independent exchanges communicate price information with each other. Then when (not if) bitfinex fails then it will drag the price of the entire magic beans "economy" down with it. I mean if you really believed in the free market then this is a part of it as well.

That's okay he has an imaginary visa.

I don't know about this. Case in point vitamins. Vitamins are allowed to make unscientific, and dubious claims of efficacy because they're not evaluated by the FDA. Strictly speaking making false claims about a product in order to sell your product is a scam whether the buyer believes it or not.
Or also Ponzi schemes. If I pay out to initial investors what they are owed on left the bag holders dry. I technical gave the first purchasers what they wanted. But it is still a scam overall.

All this work basically to say, "nothing". This is like someone convinced a magic eye puzzle has a solution when there is no solution.

Oh boy. Let's see we have, poisoning the well, and straw man. I thought bitconners are supposed to use logic, reason, and rationality? I forgot blaming the victim. Not everyone can just predict the market and buy at the right price. If bitcon is supposed to survive then the everyman should be able to buy it at an affordable exchange and not worry about losing 10% (or more!) of its value in a day. How is bitcon supposed to appeal to the common man if they can't afford to buy it, or it loses its value rapidly, or there is no where to spend it?  
Keep digging my friend.

Looks like it is trading flat right now as people try to buy in on the cheaper coins and waiting to see on what the market will do.  Typically when it goes flat after a crash it'll start crashing again.

I'd also like to point out that bank transactions are reversible.  Bitcoin transactions are not.

No problem.  I'm here not only to entertain but also educate.

LUL WUT? It is already past 800 again. lulz!   I just had a look at the bubble chart.  Looks like we're in the "return to normal" phase.  And it is already declining again.  What is great is that this is a demonstration that probably most people don't have the capital to buy in again to raise the price.  LIkewise I bet you anything that the exchanges don't have enough liquid assets to honor sell orders.  But you go girl.

I'm glad I sold at 800.  Hopefully it won't go below 650 or I will be wiped out!
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:52:53
But but the stable price was 700 all along!  This is just a market correction!!1!
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:50:53
LUL WUT? This is just a market correction!  What about two weeks ago some dude said it wouldn't go back to 700.

Give me some of dat Choo-Choo some good old pre regulated choo-choo.  Here's what I predict.  Right about now a bunch of people who don't follow newsgroups who invest in bitcoin will be hammering the servers of most of the exchanges.  Lets hope they're on a dedicated rack in a data center that has good load balancing in place.  Let's also hope the servers don't go into FSCK (because that would be for the luls) or not whatever.  Also lets hope the servers don't run windows. Some Fedora Core or Centos would be nice.  But Windows would be bad news bears.  For realz.
