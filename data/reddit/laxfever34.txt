Your arguments are always unrelated... Him posting the account has nothing to do with how thoughtful the gift itself was. You're a waste of time and I'm over this conversation

You're diminshing the amount of thought, creativity, and care that went into this gift. It will sit on this child's dresser it's entire pre-adult life. An icon. Imagine if OP passes away before this puzzle is discovered. Imagine how moving that would be for the neice? 
I honestly think this is my first interaction on Reddit with someone like you. Your life must be pretty bitter and sad for this post to anger you.... 
Hats off OP it's a very impressive and lovely gift.

Though the Bible is wrong you can't prove God didn't exist just like someone can't prove he does. Smug and arrogant atheists piss me off as bad as Bible bangers. It's all belief and opinion. 
Jesus Christ. 
Besides moderate Christian values aren't a horrible thing to install in a child as long as you're not brainwashing them with beliefs as facts.

Listen dude... I'm an atheist too. Chill. Meant to say instill but I'm swyping on mobile. 
And yes I agree you can disprove specifics in religious text but you can't disprove the theory of a creator.

First of all... The kid was just born. There's not running or opening anything. This is something that will predate this child's first memory. It's a good start to help the child understand an investment and a puzzle to figure out when she develops enough. 
Secondly I literally know nothing about you and can already tell you're a prick. 
Edit: also you're stating a lot of opinion as fact. Can you determine that money is the root of all evil? Nope. Could be inherent. Hereditary. Situational. Until you can weigh and measure it it's a theory or opinion.

Are you knocking this gift? I think that when she is old enough she is going to be blown away by how thoughtful OP was. It's like a time capsule of blowing someone's mind
