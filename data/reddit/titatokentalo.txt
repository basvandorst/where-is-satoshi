NO MOON??!"

sure, could be.
i just wish, negative remarks and end-of-world patterns arise when BTC is doing good, or when moving sideways.
It's too much black&amp;white thinking when it's pump or dump, emotion gets in the way far too often

Bitcoin will be -529$, a message will pop up, covering your whole screen, telling you to send 529$ to Mr Satoshi Nakamotos bank account

back up again, slowly to .500

the Lows are getting higher, 10k, 11k, 12k.
If i had to guess, i'd say we will not touch 12k anymore, or at least not the same number as the last 12k-low
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:01:16
Unless there is another FUD, or some bad news in general, i would say no, but that's just an opinion of course.
Just check the Lows, they grew, from 10k, to 11k, 12k, now might be 13k.

The price will dump once the ICOs are over, people transfer to NEO to participate in their ICOs, so beware of that.

Yes, but it was a bit too short\-lived, it immediately jumps to the beginning again.
Otherwise very good!
There's a couple other scenes in this series, great for memeing

Crypto is full of masochists, you have to suffer first.
"I think we have to endure this, before we can go up again."
"Not enough despair in this sub, still have ways to go lower before turning this ship around."

Has the price ever gone backwards?
We have up, down, sideways, but no backward
I hereby declare the backward movement of the bitcoin price.

Of course, TA means nada
People keep bringing up charts and stuff, 
then, suddenly, MtGox happens, and people still believe in charts?

This Bitcoin game is online since what, 2013?
Where can i find the rules, message boards (bsides financial focused like here) so i can get started.
I played a bit WoW the last couple years, but actually have very little online gaming experience.
Is there supposed to be an end to this game?
When there are huge pumps, and dumps, can we buy items to foresee such hurdles?
Obviously it takes a while to become a whale, but once you reached that level, how hard is it to stay there? Do i have to invest a lot of time to be on top of the game?
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:58:43
Shouldn't the Pump start tomorrow, not today?

At that time, the BTC-ETF speculation pump wasn't a thing, so things have changed, as they are always.
