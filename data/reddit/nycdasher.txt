No not quitting my job but I want to learn how to trade crypto and do it full time 
@_date: 2018-05-31 04:41:15
Ok thanks for letting me know.. just read some things online so apparently I don’t get a private key for my coinbase wallet.... but I looked in exodus I can’t figure out which is my private key it’s a bit confusing 
@_date: 2018-05-08 01:52:51
Wow that sounds super complex.... sounds like you have been doing this some time... do you trade full time? 
@_date: 2018-05-08 01:34:11
I thought having hardware wallets is the most secure way?? 
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:58:07
U lost it all?
@_date: 2018-05-31 04:39:12
I’ll take my chances thanks 
@_date: 2018-05-08 01:49:50
Ok thank u for the clear explanation I understand exactly how that works now but just out of curiosity, is there ever a time when you won’t find a “buyer” right away?? Because if that’s the case then it means you can’t sell immediately as if you would in the stock market no? 
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:07:34
I’m obviously brand new to it thanks 
@_date: 2018-05-22 06:52:41
I don’t know where to start as far as researching... what topic do I need to research in particular?? 
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:26:18
What do u mean by follow up to max 5 coins?? I can’t even afford 1 coin.. I just deposited $20 last night waiting forever for it to hit my account. I wana see how I do with $20 before putting in anything higher lol
@_date: 2018-05-17 02:25:25
I understand that lol but I’m asking “where” I can obtain this wonderful source of education. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 00:36:37
I did already 
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:43:27
U got a problem with my $20?
@_date: 2018-05-31 16:06:40
Coinbase and gdax doesn’t seem to have that tool 
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:57:45
I’m not sure what that means 
@_date: 2018-05-31 15:03:22
0.0039 
@_date: 2018-05-17 02:55:37
Come again? 
@_date: 2018-05-24 22:04:48
So how much do u suggest ?
@_date: 2018-05-08 01:42:30
Wait.. so say you have a unrealized gain and you wana cash out the profit how does that work?? 
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:42:55
It’s $20 fucking dollars calm ur tits. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 02:29:38
There’s gotta be something...  obviously no reading material or educational material out there will make you right every time it’s impossible however I do believe that it can help atleasy in some way. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 01:44:22
But like do you get a check if you cash out?? How do I convert bitcoin into cash like where do they do that what type of process is it if you mind explaining.
@_date: 2018-05-08 01:57:25
Result of those air drops??? Sorry couldn’t understand that term.... lol I’m brand new to this so you’ll have to excuse me.
@_date: 2018-05-08 02:09:22
I don’t think he fully understands it... Hence why I think he is so against it and why he doesn’t own any. He is also extremely old fashioned... the man is 86 years old. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:37:06
Yea, is that a problem for u?
@_date: 2018-05-23 00:37:28
I did deposit.. said it will take 8 days lol that’s crazy long. And the max I can buy is diff with two diff cards I don’t understand why. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 15:28:05
 No but I bought $20 at a diff price and $10 at a higher price that’s why I’m tryin to figure out the dollar cost average and since I brought them in fraction I’m not sure how to do that math 
@_date: 2018-06-01 03:39:53
Oh I see yea whatever fuck that guy haha 
@_date: 2018-04-26 01:23:06
Before he showed the house in my head I was like what type of house can 20k euro get you becus with his own conversion to dollars 25k in the us especially where I’m from in nyc that’s downpayment money lol. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 05:12:06
Does that pose any sort of disadvantage from a trading standpoint versus buying a full coin value? 
@_date: 2018-04-26 06:32:31
So the same disciplinary rules apply in bitcoin versus trading stocks your saying? 
@_date: 2018-04-26 05:53:28
Do you guys think bitcoin is a bit too high now for someone brand new to be getting in? Can I stand to trade bitcoin full time with as little as $500 to start and make enough money every month to sustain myself? 
@_date: 2018-04-26 05:18:35
I’m soaking in information from the bottom.. any tips or things I should read up on? I was told to read the white paper thing 9 pages of the basics of bitcoin.. I want more 
@_date: 2018-04-26 06:17:49
I have no idea what you just said lol.. it’s my second day learning about crypto dude you gotta dumb it down a few notches 
@_date: 2018-04-26 05:51:28
Wow ok thanks good to know. Any specific channels? With so much info there must be a lot of fillers and bull shit as well
