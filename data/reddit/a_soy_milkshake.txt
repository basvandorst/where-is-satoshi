What "other indicators"? He admitted to smoking weed nothing more. Having smoked weed recently doesn't mean your cash comes from selling drugs.

While I understand where you're coming from, I think your perception may be warped by this community; we see posts everyday about finally owning one whole bitcoin. People in many other countries however already deal with nominal amounts in their currency that is in the thousands; look at the yen, or the Colombian sol. The price of goods eventually dictates what feels like "a lot"; people will adapt, it isn't that difficult.

Wikipedia is a small team so they might not have the time / resources to immediately start accepting BTC. There might be an additional litigious issue which they have to consider. While this is just speculation they have a lot on their plate I'm sure. You should still donate to wikipedia with USD because like most of us, you probably use it daily for free.

I mean I suppose the coinbox.me page at the bottom is an ad. I am running adblock so that might be blocking them. Maybe though I'm not aware of what qualifies as advertising.

Regulation will however likely weed out some of those that only hold bitcoin as a tool to make money rather than use bitcoin as money.

A major problem I found with using Pheeva, and the problem is actually more with gyft, is that if you buy gyft cards through pheeva you don't get any points. Now that the iOS gyft app allows you to pay in bitcoin that isn't an issue but it is something to be aware of.

The tendency is for the price to rise. Bitcoin may take a hit but look at all the companies that are starting to accept it. People assign it value therefore they will pay to exchange it. In the short term it's a loss, in the long term probably not. Note also that it's possible to wait for the price to rise back to $650 and then sell half to break even, then hold. And of course, use the currency if you believe in it.

He's arguing that Bernie Sander's model would break up the growing plutocracy that we've allowed to form in the United States and that any tax hikes / changes would largely be unseen by you unless you are one of the top 1% that hold something like 40% of total private wealth (while the bottom 90% holds 73% of debt). To make matters worse, in 2010 it was reported that 93% of the additional income created in America went to the top 1%.
Whether or not you support Sanders or Paul this is an issue. Also I think he was referring to personal liberties that fall outside the domain of taxes and more that of drugs, marriage equality, etc.

No it doen't, not exactly. But I think point was that it's like a company explaining and promoting that which will be their downfall. responded stating why that won't be the case b/c banks, in some form, have a purpose regardless.

[I see here]( that you guys support BTC -&gt; KRW, but is it possible to go the other way without using Korbit? I've had a hell of a time trying to set it up with my Korean bank account and I don't speak Korean so it makes things very difficult.

Yeah it was annoying for me just to access blocked sights (gmail, Facebook, etc...) when I was there. I use PIA for my vpn and china blocks the default handshaking method. That in addition to tor was frustrating. I agree it's doable, I just see it as a potential hurdle.
@_date: 2015-10-06 05:45:31
While I kind of agree, saying the government never profits is sort of misleading. Does "the government" profit? No. But the acquirement of funds does mean that certain government agencies can expand their budgets and/or increase the pay of higher ups.
@_date: 2015-11-28 10:16:53
Bridges works alright I think, but not the public list. When I was in China those were already blocked for me. Unfortunately I hadn't had the foresight to realize they blocked known tor ip's. I attempted to email to get a new one but my primary email is gmail, which was blocked, so I had to set up a temporary email with another service then wait for a response. It was a doable but there are a lot of hoops for the average user I think. Just my thoughts though.
@_date: 2015-11-28 08:50:40
Maybe this is a dumb question, but I know that China for example has been relatively successful at blocking TOR communications as they keep a list of known TOR nodes. You can always get a private one or a temporary one but eventually those usually end up on that list too. Wouldn't this pose some sort of problem to bitcoin transactions? Again, maybe i'm woefully misinformed, but I am curious.
