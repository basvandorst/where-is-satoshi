Of course it does. There's even numerous terminology for it, but the gist is this: the more complex something is, the less people want it.
Simplification is the easiest way to be mainstream...
...which kind of sucks since, in terms of currency, 'simple' means legal tender. Bitcoin can still have its own niche, but it'll always take a backseat to USD for the simple reason that it's tied to it. It's bought with USD, valued in it, and exchanged for it.
Making BTC simple is difficult when the entire system is created around fiat thus making it the absolute easiest to use.

It's the flaw with real finance/economics. Nothing is obvious, you require fancy knowledge, and there's, like, a billion interconnected things affecting each other.

I've been called an undercover paid bank shill and now the alt of a famous Buttcoin user. I'm actually kind of honored you nutters think I'm nobodybelievesyou -- that means I'm doing something right.
In regards to your question as to who would make a submission like that, I'd go out on a limb and say someone who creates a subreddit like CryptoCon. I actually think highly of a lot of Buttcoin users, including Tulip, Border, and etc.

I know thousands have. They're all here in this sub crying about the steady fall in price.
Not saying it can't happened, just pointing out the implausibility of it. Real billionaires don't become that way by having emotional bursts of ideologies then dumping huge amounts of money into speculative commodities. They tend to invest from actual knowledge. See Warren Buffet's opinion of bitcoin.
You know, instead of dreaming about angel billionaires coming along to sweep bitcoin off its feet, why don't you try shilling? At least that will do something.

Well, it can be also be taken that he literally only uses it as a means of transferring money. That is he buys and cashes out bitcoin instantly.
In that case, he wouldn't need to care about the price because he cashes out too quickly for volatility to affect him (most of the time...I think).
Of course, in that case, he's sort of contributing to 'the merchant problem', isn't he?

@_date: 2014-10-02 19:01:22


I don't think so.
How do you make bitcoin attractive to the average Joe? What, tell him its decentralized?
Making it so that there are many places he can use it is a big part of making bitcoin more mainstream. So people here have the right idea in doing merchant adoption.
The reason why it's not helping demand is that people are missing another critical component: making bitcoin more attractive than modern payment systems.
And that part is impossible now because most people on this sub aren't honest with themselves. No one can admit bitcoin has little to nothing on modern payment systems.
As it is, credit/debit cards are vastly superior to bitcoin in every imaginable way. Security, protection, benefits, and ease of use.
If people really want to increase demand, the first step is to admit that. Then the second step is to fix it. No one wants to hear shit like 'be your own bank'. But 'free 5-year warranty' or ''5% discount on Amazon' without having to jump through hoops or getting involved in a scam (e.g. Purse.IO)...now there's something.

What a disingenuous petition. 
"Accepting Bitcoin presents the option of cutting out the middleman for everybody." -- I guess Bitpay/Coinbase won't count.
"There is no risk for either party (the consumer or the distributor) when using Bitcoin." -- Yeah, all those risks for consumers from using credit cards.
"Decentralized currency, Low Inflation" -- Oh, Amazon will want it for sure now.
It's rather silly how sought after Amazon is, yet some people treat them like idiots. Being disingenuous in your arguments and giving meaningless benefits makes as much of a difference as praying to Satoshi.
Or maybe...hey Amazon, give me $10 million! After all, I'm a nice guy, I love my mother, and I pay my bills! Plus, it would look really good publicly if Amazon gives money to an Average Joe like me!

Quite a lot of money has to come into the bitcon space to even keep up with all the new bitcoins mined. 3600 new ones every day or so? thats 1.35million new fiat a day just to keep the price stable at 375. 
That's assuming the price is based solely on new fiat coming in. Any sane person knows that a big part of bitcoin's price is speculation, though.
The question is what percentage of the price comes from new fiat and what percentage comprises the less savoury parts of the price.

Of course we realize. Problem is that you don't realize we don't give a shit about what merchants pay.


Question: Will I get a discount if I pay for groceries with cash or debit? I didn't think so.
But you know what? My credit cards offer me cashback, promotions, and discounts. That means -- yes -- it actually costs me less to use them.
Why don't you quit going on about hidden costs and 'psychology' and start seeing the truth? The retail world now exists with credit cards in mind, they build that into their prices, and they don't change prices regardless of whether you're using credit, cash, or bitcoin.

Protip: Initiate the transfer from your other account.

He would rightly call you a liar since bitcoin has only hit the $1200 area in 2013 and has been hovering at $600 until this current decline. A steady decline from $1200 to the current $400 () Is a first.

This is something few grasp. Risk is proportional to reward and your expectations should be as such.

To begin, there are international fiat microloan services. Kiva, for example. You probably didn't know because it isn't that popular since the number of people who want to make international microloans is minuscule.
Secondly, how is it all these potential killer bitcoin services can't seem to get investors, but need to panhandle around here constantly?
The price just fell to sub $300 -- do I look like a money tree right now?

@_date: 2014-09-29 21:06:33




How does that work? It seems to me that's a lose-lose thing for Circle.
Example: I buy $50 of BTC and lock it. One month later, the price falls by $100? I win because mine is worth more.
But if the price rises by $100? I still win because I can simply take the BTC and cash it out elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:59:29


First rule of pumping: the coins are always cheap.
Doesn't matter if it's $1, $100, $1000, then back down to $100, then back up to $1000, then hovering around $500, then back down to $400. The coins are always cheap.

@_date: 2014-10-04 18:02:32
As Cawley says.
The problem with bitcoin is that actions snowballs and the amount of investors are small enough that it has a huge effect.
Price rises steadily? People thinks it'll keep going and buys until it reaches an insane high. Price falls steadily? It'll fall until it hits a ridiculous low.
In short, weak hands everywhere. The further the price falls, the more risk tolerances break. Every time the price falls $10, I'm guessing it breaks a thousand people. And, better, it needs to rise $50 to bring those thousand back at these prices.
@_date: 2014-09-29 22:56:00
I taken a look at them -- it doesn't seem like they're the same thing.
Their 'nonvolatile option' works because they make you hold one of their five altcoins. Once you decide enough, they exchange those altcoin for bitcoin then give it to you.
In short, it's not the same thing. If you're fine with such a scenario, that's good but then I don't see why not just hold USD.
@_date: 2014-10-04 17:20:28

All of these theories passed around makes some sense and seem plausible.
The problem is that they're based almost entirely around speculation rather than real facts. Here, this guy makes a series of claims as to why Oct is the downtrend end, but the proof of his claims is merely that his last claim turned out true. How many of his predictions turned out wrong?
Instead of more and more Nostradamuses, how about these guys post their signed bitcoin address and prove their predictive capabilities by actually making money?

I never understood why some of you people become so enraptured by the honey badger meme and adopted it as a symbol of bitcoin.
You realize that honey badgers are considered a threatened species in the places where they inhabit, right? They also often get killed by simple farmers who bash their heads in because they attack livestock.
Why not a hippo? They're large, extremely tough and aggressive, fast for their size, can withstand an attack by an entire lion pride and walk it off easily, and they have the distinction of being one of the most dangerous animals in terms of human deaths.
Hippos are endangered too, but at least you need more than a club to kill them and most people wouldn't dare try.

Are you trying to point out a contradiction or something? Because I don't see it.
Or are you just incapable of comprehending basic English? If so, let me spell it out for you.
1) I don't give a shit about the fees merchants pay.
2) Telling me I shouldn't use credit because of the fees is stupid because everyone pays the fees and credit users actually pays the least.


Cool. Is there a part where you explain why one shouldn't use credit then?


Except I did mention it. You quoted it, remember?
What you miss is that, again, seeing as there is no difference in prices despite payment method, you are essentially getting paid for using credit.
If businesses are charging EVERYONE this 'credit fee', it's pointless to call it that because, again, the only people who benefits are credit users. In other words, that 'fee' becomes standard pricing.


Start listening better. The people who give those discounts are largely small business owners who hang around Reddit. You can find the same discounts from other Reddit users who haven't even heard of bitcoins.
On the other hand, is Newegg or those various retailers who have accepted Bitoay started giving discounts? I didn't think so.
@_date: 2014-09-30 12:47:29


I'd imagine the same way as...well, any other place that accepts credit cards. By simply paying the small amount of fraud that occurs and trying to prevent repeats.
I don't understand why some act as if chargebacks is some relentless epidemic. Last I checked, CC fraud as a whole (not just chargebacks) costs only $2-$3 billion a year. This is versus $200+ billion in card-based payments.
So a 1% fraud rate...and most fraud likely occurs at the biggest retailers.
In all likelihood, chargebacks will probably be a minor problem for Circle.

They've been making such promises long before 2014. They've also made it in 2013 and 2011. They'll also make it for 2015, 2016, 2017, and so on.
That's what they do. They're shills.


You've made a lot of excellent points, but I wish to modify this. Obtaining BTC isn't the only problem -- exchanging it is too.
This sub likes to champion bitcoin's use in poor, unbanked countries but every case of it happening tends to fail due to lack of needed infrastructure.
There was a recent post of two friends trying to use bitcoin in Somalia which failed because there was simply no way to exchange it for fiat. Some of the stupider elements here suggested holding or starting a business to do it themselves, but realistically, bitcoin had absolutely no use for the people there.
This isn't exclusive to third world nations either. A lot of first world nations have the same problem.
Like I said, you've made great points about bitcoin's problems, but you've only touched the tip of the iceberg. Bitcoin has a long way to go and, unfortunately, it lacks the time to do so along with the inability to create the incentive for the common man (no, 'decentralized' isn't that incentive).

Oh, people here have plenty of answers to that question. Problem is that the answers are quite possibly the stupidest ones possible.
Ask a VISA rep why one should use credit cards, he can give a mile long list of benefits. Rewards, price rewind, promotions, discounts, fraud/theft protection, extra warranty, and an endless array of other benefits.
Ask someone here why one should use bitcoin and it's like they give the exact opposite of the above as 'benefits'. No chargebacks, no fraud protection, etc.
Oh wait, bitcoin gives 'freedom' and 'world peace'. I rather have extra warranty, to be honest.

A lot of things happened with bitcoins that won't be remembered. For example, everyone remembers Mt. God but how many will remember Gnash.IO when nothing really bad happened? This also goes for the large variety of scams that occurs nut never blows up.
Honestly, though, so long as bitcoin isn't dead, there is reason to be optimistic.
@_date: 2014-09-27 14:17:09
Great story. Very uplifting after the submission about the Somali guy being unable to do the same due to lack of bitcoin exchanges in his country.
One question, though. This below.


Am I reading that right? Buying BTC in US then exchanging that for AUD in Australia would net you more money than directly exchanging USD for AUD?
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:34:23
I'm sure everyone here can asks those questions without buying bitcoin.
For those who did buy, price is the most important question.
@_date: 2014-09-26 03:46:55
I like your reply. Very convincing and well written.
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:09:21
Wait, $316?
Last I checked (I.e. yesterday), it was $370. When the hell did it go that far down and where did it reached?
EDIT: I just checked Google. It's *$314*. What the hell?
@_date: 2014-10-03 18:39:36
Wow, even for a pump post, this is particularly bad.
@_date: 2014-09-23 17:01:30
Its actually $400 now. You should wait until it hits $300 for your true second chance.

And in a few weeks, it'll change to 'We're creating a completely new security infrastructure to guarantee something like this never happen again, so we'll be reopening in 2-3 months' time'.
I don't get it. When Bitstamp first announced they were going to reopen in 24 hours, did they not know they were going to 'rebuild their systems'? And when they later changed that to 24-48 hours, did they still not know they were going to 'rebuild their systems'?
I suppose it's not at all possible they're just saying whatever needs to be said to get people off their backs. I mean, it's not like we previously had a major exchange hack where the exchange did and said very similar things.

**BUY MORE BTC**
Last time the price was this low was roughly early 2013, correct?
Well, your heart is in the right place, but you've forgotten that a lot of coins have been taken off circulation too due to hacks, thefts, lost keys, and etc.
This is really hard to know for sure due to lack of reliable sources, but a quick search says there were 11Mn coins in circulation in April 2013 but now there are about 13Mn coins in circulation. Problem is I don't know if this is excluding lost coins. Hell, Mt. Gox by itself took almost a million coins off the market.

Alright, I will provide links. Here's all from highly regarded sources in regards to how the FBI faked Green's death.

I recommend the NYT one most as its the most riveting write up.
You know, I'm a lot of things. A cryptocurrency pre-emptive journalist, a crytocurrency trader, a self made entrepreneur. But what I'm not is a criminal and I don't abide by murder. DPR could have had a lot of sympathy but he fucked up.
@_date: 2015-01-06 00:55:46


Why are you even trying to pretend you're merely an open minded skeptic? Do you believe that's how you look?
If all you wanted to know was if Ulbricht did it, the hundreds of articles on the case and the submitted court docs would have given you the answer already, especially those fun parts where the FBI faked Green's death and received payment from Ulbricht for it.
You make me depressed, man. To think there are people who complain of privacy but happily excuse murder depending on who does it. Bitcoin will free the world from biased, justice hating statists like you.
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:26:24
I call it the 'Bitcoin Cycle'. People rave heartily and merrily about new products then, when discovered product is not what it seems, promptly turns on it and act as though they knew all along.
The most recent of these is Circle/Huobi/Purse.IO, of course, but for fun, check out what people were saying about Bitstamp in the early days. It was all 'trustworthy', 'what Gox should have been', etc. Now I bet you'll hear nothing but 'we knew Bitstamp was like this for YEARS!'.
@_date: 2015-01-07 22:30:28


Why? The same reason as always: the fucking weak hands on this sub.
There's an army of weak hands on who neither understand, empathize, or even sympathize with the bitcoin cause. Rather than helping and improving bitcoin, they're in it for the profit. How do they profit? They spend their time here downvoting all potential concerns and spreading FUD in order to artificially help the price but at the cost of blocking information from the public.
As of this time, your topic is more than 50% downvoted and stands at 0 points. That has worsen in the few minutes it took me to write this post too. And for what? Pointing out that Bitstamp is not some paragon of virtue for releasing some reassuring statements which they have gone back on several times already.
Some of the people here might as well just throw all their money in a garbage bag, throw it outside, and let whatever passing conman just take it. It's the same result -- just faster.
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:53:48
Intelligent investors follows all news closely in order to properly and, most important, *accurately* assess the true risk and value of their investment and potential investments.
...thus why the weak hands on this sub have somehow came up with a 'Good news makes bitcoin's price drop' meme.
If we could have more bitcoiners like you, Science, would be much better off. For starters, Mt. Gox would have never happened. Secondly, Bitstamp would have never happened. Why? Because we'd all know about the potential issues far ahead of time instead of blaming all 'bad news' submissions on trolls.
I tremble to think bitcoin might actually have had a positive image to the general public instead of, you know, me getting asked 'Isn't that the Internet scam that keep coming up?'. Alas, I ask for too much.
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:02:02
Not even that. Before, it was specifically 'Bitstamp to reopen in 24 hours'. Now all of a sudden, it's 24-48 hours.
Man, all those weak hands praising Bitstamp for 'being on top of things' and 'not acting like Mt. Gox' must be embarrassed now. Meanwhile, the rest of us never believed them to begin with.
I'll tell you outright: this exchange is going to fail. If, by some miracle, it does open, it will be only temporarily and there is no way all (or even the majority) of withdrawal requests will be processed.
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:21:55
The guy deleted all his comments, but reading yours, I get the feeling I know what he said.
The state of ignorance in this sub is tragedy. So many people here hate banks without knowing the tiniest amount of how they even operate. They just parrot whatever big celebrity they know tells them to believe. A while back, there was a large submission in which numerous people revealed they didn't even know the difference between debit and credit -- basic fucking terms.
They should be like me. I'm a bitcoiner who understands what bitcoin should be and has integrated it completely into myself. Falling price, broken and lying exchanges, weak hand investors -- none of this bothers me. I'm not in it for the price. I'm in it for justice.
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:50:52
That's cute, Gonzobon.
Above, you muse about 'legal' being a funny word (in an article about a court case) and that you believe invasion of privacy is abhorrent.
But bring up how the accused tried to hire assassins and you suddenly go lawyer on us demanding concrete evidence from a highly specific source. Which you'll fight tooth and nail to deny anyway.
Please, tell more about the crimes you feel are abhorrent.
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:11:01
Really? That's the only way we can get a truly decentralized exchange? By forcing people to physically go to machines (that may or may not be close to them) that charges a fee anywhere from 3% to 7%? So if I buy a single BTC for $300, I'd have to pray it hits $321 just for it to break even right off the bat?
And this is assuming that you can convince people to install this 'standardized decentralized exchange software'. Because just convincing people to get a Bitcoin ATM by itself is not damn near impossible.
Then again, maybe it is the only way even if it's the hardest and most inconvenient way because weak hands on this sub seem to fall in love with any shady exchange that comes up for any damn reason. So you need to go the hard way to protect them and, ultimately, bitcoin's image (which has already been battered to hell).
Which will probably be useless anyway.
Tomorrow, if Bitstamp's replacement-to-be starts making the news for publicly slamming the U.S. government and talking about how much they loves decentralization, weak hands will be praising their name until the cows come home (or until the exchange suddenly gets hacked and lose everything). No need for intelligent businessmen with well earned university degrees, excellent professional experience, and don't have conviction records of fraud while being situated in strange, foreign countries. No, just publicly sharing the same political beliefs as the weak hands is enough.
@_date: 2015-01-05 06:54:09
The only people who needs to be reminded of this are weak hands -- people who aren't going to buy until the price starts rising again. True believers have been holding and buying...and will continue to do so even when the price hits $200 then $150 then $100 and etc.
True believers don't need reminders.
@_date: 2015-01-05 06:34:28
I think the best approach right now is to wait and see as there doesn't appear to be much choice. Well, unless you're the management of Bitstamp anyway.
Meanwhile, you should begin researching other exchanges to use. Bistamp is a disgusting weak hand. After this, buy bitcoin from other places.
@_date: 2015-01-05 06:31:40
In layman terms: A 'bank run' is when numerous customers arrive demanding their money from the bank, thus the term 'run'. There's also connotations that the bank will end up with insufficient funds, but it is not a requirement for it to be called a bank run, e.g. Greece had 'bank runs' after the declaration of deposit being taken but none actually resulted in insufficient funds.
In this case, Bitstamp are acting like a fucking weak hand, so consumers are rightly taking back their money. I don't even like the term 'bank run' in this case. I call it 'market correction'.
@_date: 2015-01-05 06:48:57
I'm not surprised.
'Ignoring all problems' and suggesting solutions via demanding customers do things a certain way is about how most BTC exchanges seem to operate. Every now and then, I see a true bitcoin believer expose a problem or suggest great changes and what happens? Weak hands immediately downvote him because they can't stand to hear problems.
We should be reaching a point where we expect a lot more from our businesses. At the very least, get exchanges to start doing audits (actual audits too) for better transparency.
Or we could, you know, not demand it and continue to allow weak hand exchanges get mysteriously hacked or lose private keys whenever the price starts to fall drastically.
@_date: 2015-01-06 07:44:55
Well, lets put ourselves in the founders- oh, uh, I mean the hacker's shoes. We just stolen 20K BTC. We can now:
1) Offload the hot BTC immediately for money regardless of how low the price will fall which we don't care about seeing as we got the BTC for free anyway. Disappear untraceably afterwards.
2) Take the risk of holding the BTC...which we stole...rather than offload immediately and wait for the price to go up so as we don't crash the price (which we don't care about because, again, we got the BTC for free).
Yeah, in their shoes, I would sell the BTC immediately.
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:39:30
OP is completely correct. The weak hands in this sub can't stand to see any bad news at all.
That's how this whole 'good news makes the price falls' meme got started. People notice the price seems to fall during times of good news and no bad news. It's not that there's no bad news -- it's that any bad news get downvoted immediately and promptly ignored.
It's only when things happened to such an extreme point that it becomes absolutely unavoidable when people start paying attention to it, e.g. a big scammer is going to attend a major BTC convention or a major exchange fails. It happened with BitStamp, it happened with Mt. Gox.
...which, funny enough, probably wouldn't happen (or at least not as badly as it happened) if the weak hands in this sub would just start paying attention to bad news.
is the perfect example of the man who ignores a small fire in his house and, rather than immediately trying to put it out, only pays attention when his house burned down and he has nothing left to live in.
Until this changes, I can tell you exactly how the next bitcoin exchange failure will happen.
@_date: 2015-01-04 08:39:48
Ignore the weak hands, OP. A smart trader uses whatever advantages is available.
Cancel that ACH and save yourself the money, then use it to buy BTC at a lower price. If Coinbase cancels your account, then so what? To begin, it's an instant 30+% profit doing this and, second, they will end up losing your business to the many other competitors.
It makes no sense to NOT do this.
@_date: 2014-09-29 00:23:58


No, it's the current situation. Do you use words without understanding their meanings?


It is. Or why don't you post all the other times it fell from $1200 to $400 as you were saying?
Take your time. I won't be holding my breath waiting for it to appear.
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:47:09


Oh man, I'm so sick of this shit. Its always 'price will go up as soon so-and-so happens' in this place.
Everyone said the same thing about the Expedia adoption, ApplePay (back when people were convinced AP was about bitcoin), Huobi launch, Circle launch, and etc.
Yet here I am in the red by 50% despite all those things happening.
I would ask you why the ETF will change everything but I'm guessing I'll just hear vague reasons like 'Wall Street will get in' and 'masses will buy by the bucketload'.
