Correct, MakerDAO is the first decentralized ethereum-backed loans. The Atomic Loans team is building the first decentralized **Bitcoin-**backed loans. 
That's an interesting point on a decentralized loan now being a loan. Since it's overcollateralized with crypto as collateral, it can also be seen as a position, which is why MakerDAO calls it a CDP (collateralized debt position).

Hey all, myself and the Atomic Loans team have been working on a standard for Hashed Time-Locked Collateral Contracts. This would allow Bitcoin to be collateralized in a debt agreement in which the borrow would be able to get access to a loan on another blockchain, such as a stablecoin on Ethereum. It works alongside ERC 1850 ([ Would love feedback from the community on this!

I completely agree. But while we fight monetary inflation, people need to be able to interact with the real world and pay for expenses. Hold onto your deflationary asset rather than selling it for an altcoin by leveraging it.

You're not loaning Bitcoin, and we'd rather not say it's through our site. Lenders lend Stablecoins (i.e. DAI, USDC, GUSD) and borrowers lock Bitcoin (overcollateralized), and get access to a stablecoin that they can use for working capital. It's not really through the site, because it's a protocol. The code is all open source ([ and you don't need to use our site to use the protocol.

If I'm a cryptocurrency miner and I make revenue for my business in Bitcoin, then I need to sell Bitcoin in order to pay for electricity, miner expansion, and other expenses. Based on many years of market data, we can assume that the price of Bitcoin overall is going to increase over the next few years. If I'm able to leverage that Bitcoin rather than selling it, I'll most likely end up retaining more Bitcoin.

you all obviously missed the point. I guess this post was clearly the wrong crowd 
@_date: 2018-12-05 21:41:22
I disagree. With POS you have a minimum amount of a currency required to stake (for example, 32 ETH in the current proposal). With mining, I can get a decent mining rig for as cheap as $500 (like the Antminer S7), and start earning rewards. In comparison, 32 ETH = 3,273.60 USD, in the current crash. This will easily be &gt; 30k if the market returns. In comparison, the barrier to entry will not go up 10x if the market returns.

To be fair, "needs to sell Bitcoin" was the phrase previously used, because that was the only option. The option now is you can sell it, or leverage it. This means you don't **need** to sell your hard earned Bitcoin to cover expenses immediately. 
Why would you leverage fiat? If you're a cryptocurrency miner, you need to sell your Bitcoin, in order to leverage fiat. I think we both know which one has a higher chance of price upside.

Last time bitcoin fell from $1100 USD down to $200 at it's lowest point in 2013/2014. It then rose all the way almost to $20k USD in 2017. That's a 100x growth. Bitcoin going down 80% is nothing. Unless the earth gets hit by an asteroid, yes we'll see 20k again
@_date: 2019-05-02 22:01:38
Also to clarify, all atomic loans are overcollateralized, so worst case scenario is your Bitcoin being liquidated.
@_date: 2019-05-03 05:54:52
The only reason you pay taxes when you sell BTC is due to capital gains tax. If you're selling stablecoin, you are not making gains on this asset so you do not need to pay tax. In a crypto-backed loan, you can leverage your BTC, differ taxes, and get access to capital in a stablecoin, which you can sell for fiat without paying taxes.

With POS you run into the problem of the rich get richer. Plus there's no extrinsic input into the network.
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:29:33
Definitely. Bitcoin went all the way up to $1100 in 2013/2014, then fell to $200. After that it went up to \~$20k in 2017. It'll rise again
@_date: 2018-12-04 22:10:08
Also if you've noticed block times are extremely irregular. You can have blocks that are mined in 1 minute or 1 hour.  The fact that you think Bitcoin blocks are exactly 10 minutes every time is retarded 
@_date: 2019-05-02 22:07:50
Not really. Say I put in $2k USD worth of Bitcoin, and I take a loan for $1k USD worth of a stablecoin. If I do nothing and the value of that bitcoin drops to $1.5k USD, then that Bitcoin will be liquidated, and the lender will get the principal + interest + liquidation fee, and the borrower will get the remaining in stablecoin. They aren't really enslaved, because it's overcollateralized, and the worst thing that can happen is the Bitcoin gets liquidated.
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:29:04
Either it adds a third party/oracle or it has owned communal contracts with things like onlyOwner ([ where the owner acts as an administrator with special privileges. 
This is why I think there are a lot of advantages to the way Bitcoin is architected, where each user deploys their own contracts, (or Bitcoin script as it's called) and there's no room to have to trust an administrator with special privileges. This is possible in Ethereum as well, called user deployed contracts, but they are rarely used.

..... I paid a high fee.... it took literally 40 minutes for one block to be mined. If you've noticed lately, many miners have dropped off, and the difficulty adjustment only happened recently. When Bitcoin fell from 6k to 4k, and lower, average block time increased substantially........ 
So no... I'm not complaining..... don't assume......
FYI, the transaction was 65 sat/byte..... because I don't like waiting.....

Bitcoin block reward halving is mid 2020. I'd recommend waiting it out until after that point. There's a pretty good chance we'll see a price increase after that point based on past history: [

Not cryptobanks. Cryptobank would mean a reincarnation of the existing financial system which we are trying to avoid. More like a disintermediated system with no delegation of trust, in which code determines outcomes, rather than the trust you put in a bank. 
"transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers." 
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:44:53
Completely agree we need to reduce the number of intermediaries in the Bitcoin ecosystem. It defeats the entire purpose of crypto. There's way too much noise in the ecosystem that is simply reincarnating the existing system. I think intermediated smart contracts (i.e. onlyOwner) are a really good example of this :(

In the case of a crypto-backed loan, that is overcollateralized, you aren't inflating the amount of overall money, because you are locking your Bitcoin. In fact you are locking more than the loan amount that you are getting from it. Taking this Bitcoin off the market for some time actually decreases the supply, potentially leading to subsequent higher value of existing Bitcoin.

This is concerning, considering there is no mechanism ensuring the stability of Tether. At least with DAI you have a stability mechanism.

I completely agree. And you should try to hold onto your Bitcoin as much as possible. Atomic Loans is helping you do that, by allowing you to leverage your Bitcoin, and get access to working capital to pay for things in the real world. Don't sell your Bitcoin. Leverage it.

Having loans where the debt is far greater than the assets is recipe for disaster. However leveraging when the loan is overcollateralized is a completely different matter IMO

Currently liquidation in the case of default is done through an auction process. Any third party can bid on the bitcoin collateral using a stablecoin, and those stablecoins are dispersed to the lender and borrower accordingly. If there is a flash crash, then the lender may recover a percentage of the collateral.

There is a significant amount of precedence from quotes throughout history regarding "Debt is slavery" (which IMO applies only to undercollateralized loans).
To name a few:
“When you get in debt you become a slave.” -Andrew Jackson
“Debt, n.  An ingenious substitute for the chain and whip of the slavedriver.” -Ambrose Bierce
"A man in debt is so far a slave.” -Ralph Waldo Emerson
“Debt is the slavery of the free.” -Publilius Syrus
“Wars in old times were made to get slaves. The modern implement of imposing slavery is debt.” -Ezra Pound
The difference between this \^ and overcollateralized loans is that an undercollateralized loan is an IOU based on promise, and an overcollateralized loan is an IOU based on an underlying asset.
