DO NOT look at my loss and just look at your own ass!

Big players are rescueing the price.

now they wake up, buy buy buy
@_date: 2016-08-07 08:06:37
people buy and leave, that's all. Like Mtgox. Because thransfer BTC is much faster than USD. PEOPLE JUST WANT TO LEAVE THIS DAＭＮ PLACE ASAP!
And if BFX want to stop and prevent the btc drain. The btc inside BFX will BFXcoin and worth nothing.

Bitfinex is dying, no doubt.

Everyone will do the same thing. I just want to know if there is some condition behind it, such as if you withdraw fund, you then admit the loss and cannot sue them?
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:35:12
I will put a huge short positions before hacking. And when price comes low, close the short positions and call a huge long positions. And then return the stolen coins!

They want liquidation but no law/money punishment!

"because your BitGo wallet is frozen". This is feckless response. BFX users don't have to know what is behind your service. It is you BTX's fault and duty!

They never plan to pay you back. Acctually after a few month you will get used to the loss and foget the pain. Maybe also the password. And finally they will told you no payback in a way that you will feel no angry. I just know it, it is human nature!
