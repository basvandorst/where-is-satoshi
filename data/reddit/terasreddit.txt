This question seems a bit silly. Blockchain is pioneering technology.. it's the biggest thing that's happened since the internet was created. The only bubble that exists is in crappy coins that bring nothing to the table that people are wasting their money with. Only the most solid projects will thrive. That's one of the big reasons I invested heavily into SophiaTX since it would still have a major use case between businesses during a bear market.

Bitcoin is a store of value like a digital form of gold. If you believe in the technology and think cryptocurrency is the future way people will manage their finances and transact, then it's a great investment. The best way to get involved is to buy a small amount of Bitcoin or Ethereum and invest it into new cryptocurrencies (alt coins) that have potential. Then you can turn your profits back into Bitcoin

If you can I would hold them. If institutional money comes into the market, which people are thinking could happen within the year or two the price will skyrocket. This year alone the price has gone up 5x.

Yay.. I can't wait until people in the U.S. can't invest in ico's anymore because you have to be an accredited (i.e. rich) investor.

Not sure we're done yet TBH. The bounces are short lived and have happened at 8 a.m. eastern the last three days on the dot... every time I've been tempted to buy, the next days lows are lower. The tug of war starts in the afternoon and the blood starts flowing through the late night/early morning hours. Almost like clockwork!

Anyone looking at the long play here will see our highest highs are getting lower and lower every day. I think we're on the back end of a slope.. can see it going down much further still before a massive rebound. RSI showed BTC was way overbought between 4-5k range. Even without China FUD a correction was due.

I don't think it can be in its current form. The move to decentralization, privacy and control over your personal information and finances are all offshoots of libertarian ideals. If governments clamp down on it and we enter a future world where we're forced to wear a barcode or have our info stored on an implanted chip to transact, that's when I'd be worried. Blockchain could be the vehicle that would allow that to happen.

Just a theory, but maybe Wall Street is in cahoots with the PBoC? Manipulating the price down so it becomes more attractive to all the new investors that will flood in if federally regulated Bitcoin ETF gets approval.
