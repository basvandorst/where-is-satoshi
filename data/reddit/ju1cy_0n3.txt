$14,400 a year extra is enough to pay most mortgages and the electricity bills that mining causes.
Average mortgage payment is $1,036 per year in the US. 
$12,432 per year for the mortgage and an extra $1,968 to pay electricity bills. At that rate you're pulling probably about 2000W, so that's about $5 a day or $1,825 per year.
That rig is capable of paying for a house by itself minus actual utility use.

Gotta remember bro, people bought in at 19.8k a few weeks ago and now this is happening, it takes some strong resolve to hold through this.

You could say the same thing about most stocks as well, previous value doesn't mean it isn't worth it's current value.
AAPL has been below it's current value for 99.9+% of its life and has only been above it for 2 days.
GOOGL is at an all time high right now 
AMZN is below it's current all time high but it was below it's current value for over 99.99% of its lifetime (been below it's ATH for almost 5 days now)
WMT is currently at an all time high of 105.45

If scenarios are stupid and don't apply to anyone.
If I played the 2008 stock crash and played every single Bitcoin dip and peak I would be the richest man on the planet right now.
If I bet my house on green last time I was at the roulette table I would have enough to support myself and the rest of my extended family for life.
Basing your investment off of what if bullshit is stupid and how you lose money. Yeah a lot of people probably have more Bitcoin than before the dip because they traded it properly, but I guarantee more people lost Bitcoin because they didn't trade it correctly and sold low and bought high. Nobody on this earth is a clairvoyant.
I'm holding because 1. I can afford to lose the money I put into it and 2. I am too stupid and inexperienced to profit off of daytrading, yes it would suck if Bitcoin and all cryptos took a huge nosedive and never recovered but I would easily survive the hit, I know there is at least someone out there who has a shit ton of money in Bitcoin and this dip could cost them half of their investment, saying "if you just sold at the peak and bought at the dip you would have made money" is focusing on an event that will never change, and doesn't determine anything to come. 
If someone wants to sell then let them sell, I personally trust in Bitcoin and what it strives to be, nobody will know what the correct course of action will be until next year.
As for the emotion standing, even the rules you make are determined from your emotions, we are humans and are emotion centered beings, the only people who can function like robots are sociopaths and robots, everyone else has an emotional tie to everything they do which is what fuels the what if scenarios.

I've got a pretty big portfolio for a 20 year old, and even though I'm an impulsive idiot, I only put 1% of it in cryptos; 0.9% in Bitcoin and 0.1% in Monacoin.
Luckily that 1% doubled and then some, and I may move a little bit more over to cryptos, but I'm sure as hell keeping that at under 10% of my portfolio.
If Bitcoin pulls up enough for me to put a deposit on a house in pulling out, the stress would be too much for me to handle knowing I have 100k just waiting.

It's more like sticky notes on the ground or index cards. Their only use now is basically for note taking.
The largest Bolivar is 100,000. The exchange rate is roughly 250,000 VEF/USD.
Even if every single one of those was the largest bank note in production it would be only worth $0.40USD each. It's likely they are the lower notes, so each one would be worth roughly $0.0004 or less.

It's not used because it's volatility is insane. It's bounced from 11.6k to 10k in less than 5 hours, companies can't base their business on a currency that is unpredictable (IE: You don't know if it'll be worth 12k when you wake up or 9k). The USD, Euro, GBP, Yen, Won, etc... Is all stable and easier to give a much smaller range of worth over a short and even medium term, which makes it easier and cheaper to function.
Running a business is easier, more profitable, and safer when you run it off of something that doesn't change by 10% in a matter of hours. If you're a business owner who is running on Bitcoin you are simply put a stupid business owner. Yes you as a business owner may become filthy rich, but your business would be bound to fail.

I like how he said "Bitcoin has no intrinsic value" in comparison to gold.

@_date: 2017-11-21 17:24:27
That's exactly what intrinsic value means though. It's based on its usefulness.
Yes gold has a very high intrinsic value, but it's a lot harder to use than Bitcoin currently. It is significantly more challenging to trade gold for money and items, and gold is used more as a store of wealth (even though Bitcoin is as well, you can at least buy things with it, which is done a lot more often than gold).
Everything is situational though, if we bring different scenarios in then yes, Bitcoin wi have a lower intrinsic value than gold would. For example, if we run into a situation where power is cut worldwide, and all government backed currencies die, aside from the fact that we would be totally fucked as a human race, gold would rise above Bitcoin in its value as a currency. In a situation like this though, I would rather have a shitload of alcohol, which would have the highest intrinsic value since you can get fucked up with alcohol. Can't get fucked up with gold.
I'm fully expecting cryptocurrency to overtake the market cap on gold, it may not happen before I retire, and it probably won't be Bitcoin that leads it, but it's going to happen eventually.

On Monday the BCH difficulty will adjust to match the market, so it's going to bounce up 20% per block for over 11 blocks until the algorithm decides it is at around a 10 minute block, which will make it a lot less profitable.

It won't stay like this forever, eventually Bitcoin will hit a peak and either level out or tank.
Once supply and demand equal each other it will stay the same. I don't think it will keep going up forever, but I also don't expect it to stop any time soon.
It's just hard to imagine that Bitcoin would ever be worth more more than the US market without a lot of countries and even banks adopting it.
Wall street is already in on this so it's going to do well, but if you hear governments say their currency is based on 'The Bitcoin Standard' then you better buckle your ass up because the speed at which its going up might actually snap your neck.

I don't understand why people do this, Bitcoin is so predictable short term that it hurts. Cancelling S2x did literally nothing to bitcoin, but I knew the hype would make it spike. I sold all my Bitcoin at 7750 and bought back at 7319. If I was ballsier I would have held and dumped at 7850 and bought back in around the 7200 mark, but I'm happy with a quick 6% profit for basically no work at all.
I don't really get how people think that just because s2x is canceled that Bitcoin is going to the moon by the weekend. It's going to do the same shit it's been doing.
We are going to hit a new all time high (not including the s2x cancellation spike) in the next couple days, probably around 7800 or so, then it's going to dip back to 7400, and repeat.

Leveraging Bitcoin could be extremely profitable, if you knew what you were doing and what to expect, I guarantee people could easily add an additional 15-20% increase per week on top of Bitcoin's price change.
Forex trades work with single digit margins of change, imagine if you could work with a 20% margin of change. The price seems to dip more often than it breaks ATHs so all you'd need to do is short with a heavy leverage at an ATH, and just hold the red until it dips into deep green.

But I'll mark down all my sells and buys so even though my wallet will be growing due to additions you'll be able to see the percent gain/loss on every trade.
I can do it now but I will be focusing on the percent gain instead of the monetary gain. I'm not going to risk a ton on any of my trades so most of them will be around 2% per trade.
I'm also going to look into getting a margin account from somewhere.
