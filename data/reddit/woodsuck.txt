Ok, a more thought-through comment than my first: I think there is no energyproblem with btc-mining, because bitcoin-mining indirectly support green energy and decentralized energy-generation (solarcells/wind-turbines), and for mining at desolate places. And increase the speed of developing of solarcells with high quality (benefits everyone).

Why cant bank offer a wallet, and offer some insurance to the customer that bitcoin don't vanish/disappear? It also creates that if someone get to know that someone else has bitcoin, it is not given that the person has the private keys at home because of it (being insecure at home is not good thing if having a lot of bitcoin), but could as well have it protected by another institution for some fee per year. It increase the alternatives for people in how to store bitcoin (and does not take away the normal way of having the own private key/wallet).

Steal it from someone. They say bitcoin-price go up when people or exchanges is robbed of their bitcoins. Its a win-win factor. And it is both  praised and a blessing for the rest of the bitcoin-community. "It is good for bitcoin when someone is losing bitcoin"  and have been said a lot of times among btc-holders. So go ahead and steal it. Why buy something that is not defended in law-system and only driven by a bunch of anarchists? Be the anarchist yourself. Or don't.

First they had a photo of Satoshi Nakamoto with  21 million pixels from an old digital camera, and wanted to sell the pixels as shares. Then Satoshi decided to be anonymous, so the pixels was blanked but still indexed in a database and sold, now as storage-pointers to "bitcoins" instead. And there it is.

Also.. doing surveys. But it is very boring, making your IQ go down a little bit for every question. I did it myself for a while, and got $10-$15 in one week, and got it converted to Bitcoin. I do not remember the site I used, because I cant find the link among all my zillions of links I have, but there is many of them that pay in bitcoin or paypal. Conclusion is.. the more boring life you have, the less surveys you get to answer (which they find out via the surveys as well). Being a mom in 30's with kids in different ages, having an interesting job with big responsibilities and do a lot of travel and buy a lot via eshops is a big plus.. lol. I am not a woman/mom nor have kids, don't travel very much, so I am very boring to them, though I did still get to earn money while being honest with my self.

I agree with post. Plus that gold was filled with greed and robbers, and so are Bitcoin. Very similar in both fails (80% went in loss or got scammed 2017, and will keep happen with all crashes bitcoin have), and where gold didn't confirm the owner for his/her protection, but owner had to confirm the gold for keeping it and the value. Bitcoiner have to guard the price-tickers plus the private key. Government-money (as for fiat) is better than gold or bitcoin in that point of view, where it also can be used "offline" and do not need a password (private key) to a global server (blockchain) to use it.

Ok, thanks for your answers. But I don't have the answer clearly to me. 
I should have phrased it as a question instead.   
"Is Bitcoin having an inflation of 10%+ in 10 years from now?"
"If not, then why?"
  
If I buy one bitcoin year 2011, it is one bitcoin of around 3 million bitcoins I own.
If I own the same bitcoin today, it is one bitcoin of around 17 millions bitcoins (a less % of many more bitcoins). 
In ten years, I have 1 bitcoin out of some 20 millions bitcoins. 
It means that my share of 1 bitcoin is less in % from the total amount, the more bitcoin that is released. 
And because the marketcap is based from the bitcoins that is mined (not bitcoin that is not mined).
(BitcoinMarketcap divided in amount of bitcoins = daily bitcoinprice.)  
How many % will this be 10 years from now? 
I see bitcoin as a circle-diagram with slices, where I own a slice (and 1 bitcoin is some % of the whole circle, where this % also is the same % I have access to - of the whole daily marketcap). 
  
In future, my % will be a bit less than today, because marketcap is not based on that the circle is 100%, but is based on the amount bitcoins that is mined. So when more bitcoins is mined, the circle is increasing and my % of what I own is decreasing (and where I made this post about inflation). The bitcoinprice will be inflated is my statement. But.. 
Why is this not inflation if so?  Or.. how many % will it actually be in 10 years from now?   
I am not thinking this does matter to much, because of the extreme price-fluctuation in bitcoin, but I still think it is interesting just for facts and maths.

I can't see any unconfirmed transaction on this address as expected. If you can get the TX from the sender instead, it might be possible to boost beforehand.

Bitcoin is not counted by the amount of (21 million) bitcoins.   
Bitcoin is counted from a share of the total bitcoin-market-capitalization, which is (in numbers):  
0.0000000476190476190476 share per bitcoin.   
And this is when or if counting the share from 21 million, and not counted from how many bitcoins that is mined today. Then each bitcoin is represented by a slightly higher number of: 0.0000000553018949802636 share of the total marketcap.
So if thinking 0.0000000476190476190476 (that is a percent-number after all) is unique, it is really not.   
Because bitcoin is not a "locked unit" like fiat-bills are, because you lose some in fees here and there after you "buy 1 hole bitcoin", suddenly it become to 0.9992893823 bitcoin or similar. And because how the bitcoin-price change for a product on market from one day to another, 1 bitcoin is therefore not unique to market either, but is in relation to the market-cap (which is this not so unique % number).

Coinbase are a retard-management-system trying to drain people of money more than being an exchange.   
Their goal is that people gonna support stablecoins (like usdc, usdt, tusd).   
They want to have Bitcoin as a form of lottery-credits given to the buyer, for buying the stable-coins (like governmentbased lotteries).  
Bitcoin is not as much backed by people anymore, but by exchanges (like coinbase, bitfinex and stable-coins, i.e fiat-money).   
If fiat-currency gonna be volatile in future, then bitcoin will be as well. Who wants to have their savings/funds in government-based lottery-tickets? 
So it gonna crash again soon.

What if Satoshi Nakamoto is not a name (like a forename and a surename)?  
Isn't it a bit strange to choose something that looks like a "normal name"?(Plus that Satoshi and Nakamoto is both common last names in Japan, and not a first name + last name).
If "Satoshi" repesented a crypto-technique, then why would not the name be an encrypted message itself?  
An example of a simple anagram (because I have thought about it, not saying that it would be super-simple anagram because of it):
  
"Shoo Satan Komati"
  
A japan name is perhaps easier to have as an "crypto key" because of all strange combination of letters that can build up a name in Japan and Asia..
  
So, I defend my own example this way:
Wikipedia:  
"The **Komati**  is an Indian trading community found primarily in southern and central India, that is currently organised as a [caste]( The members of the Komati caste are commonly engaged in banking, money lending and other business pursuits."
  
What I understand, The komati is not very liked by some people, because of trading is ruled in a certain way, and "could" represent the banking system overall.
  
And when looking at Shoo Satan Komati:
Then there is these three letters that potentially short it to SSK.
  
  
If anyone wanted bitcoin to be part of a study and a test within the interest of "Sociology of Scientific knowledge" (SSK) and for representing the name, and then added the other words to "SKK" for expanding it to some words speaking for the subject or intention around banking-structure, and then fit it to a japanese name.. well..?

Buy bitcoin here.   
Wait until satisfied.  
Wait a bit more to get back the fees.  
Then sell bitcoin.

No problem. I actually went through some post earlier today, and boosted yours again together with 2 others. And now boosted it second time today. It seems the service is changed, where boosting not getting same priority as before. That together with pay-services that pops up on net for tx-acceleration, it seems like it's the new direction for boosting, sadly.

Think about Bitcoin as holes that miners dig, and investors is buying the holes and think its a nice storage - while the money is leaving with the miner that sold.
