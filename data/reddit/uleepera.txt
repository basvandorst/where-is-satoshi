Gold is not a currency anymore.  I can't use it to buy essentials for living.  I can't do with that crypo's either.  
Following that, I can't answer your question.  It depends on what I'm trying to accomplish.  They have different merits, one significantly more speculative than the other.

You wouldn't call this a significant order imbalance?

I'm not sure what country your from.  I'm in Pennsylvania in the US.  If I took a gold coin to the grocery store they would tell me to come back with real money.  The only way I have locally to handle it would be a jeweler store or pawn shop.  Neither of these are going to give me close to fair value.  Not a single bank would exchange gold for currency.  How would you define this as highly liquid?

Do some homework.  Your mistaken.  This is only one example of different reasons for halting.

No, I wasn't.  Although circuit breaker rules are another good example.  
I was referring to the significant drops in the individual coins although I understand your reference as I wasn’t super clear.  
Both circuit breakers and trading halts would have been implemented over the last week.  If there was an index of the major coins the amount of volatility/percentage of movement would have easily triggered a CB.  Similarly, with halting the percentage movements as well as order imbalances would have triggered a halt.

I think its a fair comparison.  It trades more like gold than a currency.   Not to say it won't eventually be a currency though.

Seriously dude?  They are actually pretty relaxed.  If this were a regulated market it would have been halted even earlier
