I thought LocalBitcoins only allowed face-to-face meetups? It's late at night here.

Indeed.  Do you have any ideas? See my latest response.

Wire transfer then?

Bitsquare offers no help.
As I understand it, paypal only allows the receiver to refund the sender, not the other way around right?

Looks like some kind of way to link bitcoin with amazon spending. Just created account, poking around now. How do I add credit card/debit card funds to my wallet from here?
Only way to add fiat funds to this weird site is through something called Shapeshift? How does this work? 
Edit: Nope, no way to plug my credit card in and deposit 0.00624 bitcoins at 1DubtBaxEe5yznnLdywAWspkKsec3JenZ5
Any other suggestions? Help?

Oh yeah good point. Wire transfer then?  I also use Skrill.

I'm in Canada, not US. I'll try there too.
Edit: Looks like a store network. Not what I need. Need an online way to dump a little bitcoin in my wallet.
Can you help? I can pay you back with paypal, I just need about 0.00624 btc sent to my address before the price drops any more or the coffee shop the atm is in closes down for the night.
@_date: 2016-12-30 05:33:45
Yeah. Let's hope the price doesn't drop any more (looks like it's about to plunge though) and I'll try again tomorrow.

Looks like I'm outta time. No way I could confirm a trade with somebody on LocalBitcoins and get to the coffee shop before they close. (sigh)
Well thanks for trying to help me I guess.
