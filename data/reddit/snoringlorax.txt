I accidentally told you the long-term rate. Short term capital gains are taxed as regular income. So if you make $10k in gains from bitcoin, you will be taxed as if you made $10k in income this year.

If you don't sell, you don't need to declare or pay anything.

The basic fact remains - you put so much money into BTC that you have nothing in your bank account. Not exactly smart.

This sub is completely ridiculous for supporting this. If you are poor and only have a little bit to invest, it should NOT be going towards something volatile like bitcoin.
Why not take that money and contribute to a 401k (potentially with an employer match) or any other tax-advantaged account? Any left over money that you're willing to invest should ALWAYS go into tax-advantaged buckets first.

I think you're confused about what a wallet it. It simply stores your bitcoin - why does it require an ID?
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:48:29
You don't "know" more than anyone else, so don't pretend to.

Basically making $X in gains means you're taxed the same as if you made $X in income. If X is low enough, your total income tax may be 0.

Quantum computing would disrupt a lot more than just bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:37:30
No it won't

You will be taxed short term capitals gains tax. Depending on your tax bracket this is 0%, 15%, or 20%.

Welcome to this sub
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:15:26
Doesn't even surprise me that there are people on this sub that have negative bank accounts yet still invest in BTC
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:43:24
Yes it could be 0
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:32:26
Dude relax. It can take up to 7 business days. Maybe even more now that volume and new users have been so high. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:33:48
Lol yes there's no amount that's tax free. If you make $65 as income you have to pay taxes on it too. This is no different. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:44:47
This is simply untrue - where are you getting this number? You pay capitals gains tax on any profits. If you cash out within one year of buying, you pay your marginal tax rate. If you cash out after one year, you pay long-term capitals gains tax, which is either 15% or 20% depending on your tax bracket.

To be fair, Buffet is right. It's not an effective currency yet.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:46:00
Good idea! Then when the IRS inevitably gets a hold of BTC transactions on exchanges, you'll be liable for huge penalties, back-taxes, and possible prosecution. Splendid!

Bitcoin is too volatile to be a currency. Why is that so hard to grasp? Even the hyper-bull, Mike Novogratz, agrees that it's not stable enough to be a currency right now.

Jesus I can't even begin to address all of the stupidity in this comment.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:56:56
Are there better places to sell, and does selling have to happen on an exchange? I want to avoid Coinbase's fees if possible. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:41:24
What did you expect buying such a volatile asset?
If you're freaking out over a $2000+ drop, then you're doing it wrong. You should have already been in the right mindset - that you may lose everything - before you even invested.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:05:02
Cashing out also moves your money away from a volatile asset. If I had $10 million in BTC I'd cash out, invest a big chunk in a boring stable fund, and coast for the rest of my life.
You're welcome to keep your money in a risky asset, but don't shit on people for making sound financial decisions. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:45:44
You're assuming subsequent gains. It's not guaranteed.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:10:20
You're a dumbass
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:48:34
This is why you don't use an exchange as your wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:27:43
It's also a mobile app. Maybe he downloaded that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:30:39
How do you then sell the BTC you have transferred to your wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:48:56
Should you really be buying bitcoin if you don't know anything about personal wallets?

The fuck does this have to do with Bitcoin? Should we post on here every time we buy a new car?

How delusional are you people?
