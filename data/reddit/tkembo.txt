Well it's a lot better after the country switched from the Zim dollar to the US dollar but there is still a lot of room improvement - Bitcoin will make a huge difference.

I would like to learn more about your business when you are now ready to talk about it. You can DM me a link or something. I would really love to see a Bitcoin ATM in Zimbabwe

This is a great question and problem I have too so I have also asked you question to the Bitcoin community on [Quora](
@_date: 2014-09-30 01:46:09
I couldn't wait to leave purse.io as bitcoins there are terribly expensive
@_date: 2014-06-29 21:46:25
&amp; I'm following BitPesa very closely. I'm really keen to see how they are going to do remmittances successfully and thinking about how we can get something like that to work in Zimbabwe. It currently costs $15 to send $140 to Zimbabwe from the US and that is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 22:42:56
Thanks. Both solutions do work.
My challenge with the first is that I would rather keep my full time job (which is already keeping me busy enough) and use the money I am making there to buy bitcoins. But unfortunately I don't have that luxury.
The second option works too but the challenge I have had being a Bitcoin evangelist here was being unable to SHOW some how Bitcoin actually works or starting to stammer when they ask me how many Bitcoins I own or how they can obtain them. I'm also a BitPay integration partner for Zimbabwe (I have even helped two local companies to start accepting Bitcoin) but I could only get my friends to agree to this because BitPay doesn't have relations with local banks so they can't deposit small volumes to the accounts of small merchants as they do in other countries 
@_date: 2014-05-23 06:31:05
I don't know if they are but I don't think they should be because currencies should be [fungible]( What this means is that one bitcoin (or fraction of it) should be exactly equal to another unit of the same size. Regardless of the source or how many sub-units it has. Let me give an example, a $10 bill should be exactly equal to ten $1 bills. Regardless of source of some of the $1 bills. 
Like cash, Bitcoin is fungible.
@_date: 2014-07-01 05:39:36
oh I see (i didn't really know how big it is as I have never seen one in real life). I guess it would be best to put it in a restaurant then. Restaurant because no one can pick it up unnoticed by the staff who will be in charge of it. Also, if I was a restaurant owner, I would let someone put a Bitcoin ATM in my restaurant for free because it would generate more traffic to my restaurant (free publicity). But that's just my opinion.
What do you think?

You're right! Bitcoin is the most organic currency out there

I suggest you put the whitepaper on Github. There it's easier for us to make suggestions and ask questions (using pull requests and comments) IMO.

Yes there are. We now have a number of [Tech Hubs]( in Africa

Can it be used in a production environment today? Is there some sort of documentation on how to set it in a production environment?
Also, how can a developer get started if they wanted to contribute code? Is there some sort of roadmap?
Are there only two developers right now?

My thoughts exactly! Thanks for the tip

Credit cards were not designed for the internet. But Bitcoin was

I think a two-way bitcoin ATM would be a better way to solve that chicken and egg problem
@_date: 2014-09-21 19:31:36
The problem with tipping is that you can't really stop people from using your internet for free. Tipping may work fine in countries such as the US where people already have a culture for tipping but in countries in Sub Saharan Africa for instance tipping is very rare. 
But I guess it would be to give the person sharing the internet connection the option to collect tips or charge for useage
@_date: 2014-05-23 05:48:07
An android phone/tablet is a non-starter. You can't mine bitcoin profitably using a laptop or server. If you are serious about mining you might want to consider investing money in buying an [ACSI Miner](

It was good to meet you too. The trip to Austin has been the most inspiring 6 weeks of my life.

I don't mean to be sarcastic but the best way to move money out of Zimbabwe is Bitcoin. You must know that we stopped using the Zimbabwean dollar 5 years ago and ever since we moved to the US dollar  one of the restrictions the Central Bank put was to make it difficult to move money out of the country. To do an international transfer you have to provide an invoice first to prove that you want to buy something.
Oh, &amp; I almost forgot. The other way to move money out of the country is to use a VISA or MasterCard debit card but the transaction limits for these are only a few thousand dollars. Unfortunately no exchange allows you to buy using a debit card (at least none that I know of). But then again, in every problem is an opportunity right?
@_date: 2014-06-19 05:19:54
I think the reason is the chicken and egg problem. No one is using Bitcoin in third world countries right now. If you want to buy them, no one is selling them bcoz no one has them. If you want to sell, no one will buy for the same reason. Chicken and egg problem. 
I think the cause is that the early adopters were not from 3rd world countries - had third world countries been early adopters, people in third world countries would be using it now because they would have the bitcoins to do the transactions with

I live in Zimbabwe and there, it's impossible to buy bitcoin. I discovered bitcoin in July 2013 and since then I have been trying to buy bitcoin and so far, I haven't been able to make a single purchase. I have contacted every bitcoin exchange, none of them will allow me to buy or verify my account because I am from Zimbabwe. I tried mining but it was too late - I only made a few satoshis (that were well below ghash.io's withdrawal threshold). I have written to many exchanges offering to help them to offer their services to Zimbabweans - that has gotten me nowhere but I won't give up. 
I put an advert on localbitcoins.com offering to pay cash for bitcoins and I log in every few weeks to make sure it's active but I have never had any inquiries. I tried once to use Western Union to buy on localbitcoins but I found that Western Union doesn't allow Zimbabweans to send money outside Zimbabwe because of restrictions in our monetary policy. 
If I could afford to do so, I would purchase a robocoin or skyhook and I'm waiting with bated breath for someone to bring one to Zimbabwe because right now, it's impossible to buy bitcoin. And believe me, I have tried.

I would like to know how to implement BitcoinQt in another programming language
@_date: 2014-09-21 19:26:20
Yes they do. So you will need to go within 40 ft of someone who has installed the app. Hopefully this won't be too big a problem when the app goes mainstream

It's quite easy to buy on Amazon and Ebay. You can get a debit card from your bank that is accepted on both. I've done this a few times before.
@_date: 2014-06-17 23:52:27
I agree. In fact I think it will be better to set up a Bitcoin ATM in Zimbabwe than a Bitcoin exchange that works in Zimabwe and the reason is that Zimbabweans don't have Bitcoins now so an exchange cannot work ther

What are they doing to spread the adoption of Bitcoin and make it more mainstream?
@_date: 2014-11-19 04:18:01
Thanks for sharing these ideas. With your permission I will use this information you have shared to update my article - specifically:
* that tipping is an American thing not a Western thing
* how the advice given to people getting into Bitcoin is to buy more than you can afford to lose
* And the examples you give that counter my arguments - mobile phones and mobile money which have taken off so well and so rapidly in Africa.

@_date: 2014-09-21 13:58:33


Adding it to Tomato is a brilliant idea. I was really thinking of building an app you install on your phone or your laptop. So that if you have an unrestricted internet connection connection at work, an unlimited internet subscription with your MNO or an uncapped internet subscription at home you can for example share your internet connection with your neighbour  while you are sleeping. And get paid with a crypto currency you can you when you travel abroad for instance.
Thinking loudly here, an app installed on the device of everyone (connected to a central internet connection) who is creating a hotspot is more decentralised than a single installation on Tamato. But then again it would be good to have both.
Thanks for the suggestion. Let me add this to the white paper.
@_date: 2014-05-23 04:43:44


It depends. If you live in the US for instance it's a lot easier to buy them with fiat and a lot harder to get them by mining unless you have money to invest in buying specialises hardware called ASIC miners. 
I live in Zimbabwe, Africa and it's very difficult to get bitcoins here. Reasons are two fold:
* firstly, none of the bitcoin exchanges in the world today allow you to trade bitcoin for fiat if you live in Zimbabwe
* only a handful of people actually own bitcoins so the chances of finding someone willing to sell you some are close to zero. Actually, I have been advertising on [localbitcoins]( that I am willing to buy bitcoins for cash for months now but I have not had a single enquiry from someone willing to sell.
So, it depends on what country and city you're from
About the other questions, like  has pointed out, you clearly haven't read the Bitcoin Whitepaper yet. Do that now. Here's a link to the whitepaper: [

@_date: 2014-05-28 19:45:18
I see Zimbabwe on the list of countries on the verification form. Does this mean that you will allow someone from Zimbabwe to trade BTC/fiat once they provide all the documentation? ...because if you do, then you will be the first exchange that allows people in Zimbabwe to trade between BTC/fiat.
@_date: 2014-06-19 05:22:07
Good suggestion but I'm convinced that a Bitcoin AMT would be a better solution
@_date: 2014-09-15 15:38:17
Transcription was perfect!


The double negativity was just a play on words to make it more interesting. Let me illustrate the idea I was trying to bring out with an example: Bitocoin is not a ponzi scheme. So Bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme (what it's not). It is not what it's not (a ponzi scheme). Does it make sense to you now?
Thanks for the tip.

Thanks for the suggestion. Using Bitcoin is a good idea but making it an altcoin has the advantage that you can pre-mine it and basically reserve some coins that can be used to reward developers and early adopters. What do you think?

The only currency being used in Zimbabwe right now is the US dollar.

I sent the funds from a blockchain.info wallet and those were all the funds I had in my wallet. Given my situation, is it possible to double spend. If so, how would I go about it?

And there is nothing I can do about it now right?

The biggest value proposition for me (a consumer) is that I get to keep my own money. If you have fiat, the only way you can keep your own money is to keep it as cash - the moment you want to store it digitally, you have to trust someone else with your money. I live in a country where multiple banks have failed in the last 5 years alone. I don't want to trust someone else with my money. I want to keep my own money. I want to be my own bank!
@_date: 2015-01-19 16:06:07
If it's any useful, I used a blockchain.info wallet

@_date: 2017-01-28 17:34:23
it's not yet unlocked but hopefully I'm close to getting it unlocked. They have now sent a verification code to my email and told me to reply to the support ticket with the unlock code to get my account unlocked. I did that about 13 hours ago and I'm still waiting for them to unlock the account. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 17:39:13
They asked me to describe the source of my most recent Monero deposits and asked me to enable 2FA on my account. Funny I need it to be unlocked first to be able to do the later.
@_date: 2017-01-27 16:09:21
Only when I'm trading. But next time I'm using something like Shapeshift

There are still many countries where it's hard/impossible for people there to buy bitcoin but people there have bank accounts that allow them to get credit/debit cards they can use to make online payments. Examples are many African countries - only a handful of African countries have bitcoin exchanges.
There are still some places where the bitcoin that's sold on exchanges is significantly higher than the 20% on Purse. Here are some blog posts with more information:
- [Why the price of bitcoin in Africa is significantly higher than it is on other international exchanges](
- [A Bitcoin is worth 70% more in Nigeria than in America, and here is why…](
BTW, I don't Purse.io would still be in business if bitcoin buyers were only  fraudsters.
