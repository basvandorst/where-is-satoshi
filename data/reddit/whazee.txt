lol.... scam...
from the FAQ:
"Is CRYPTOSx2 a ponzi scheme? It depends... On CRYPTOSx2 certainly new investments's amounts go to existing ones. But unlike ponzi schemes, we provide complete transparency about all data and clear rules about how cryptocurrencies are distributed. "
So, it's a ponzi scheme scam but it's ok because the owner provides datas on how he scams everyone xD

**Why is Luckygames a scam?** PS: the guy beind Luckygames is behing that casino too.
* **First**,
the same guy is using multiple accounts to promote and defend that casino, making it look like actual users are satisfied with it. Check the list of username below, they are all advertising for the casino and defending it on threads started under another pseudo (an exemple amongst many others: 
*List of acounts:*

powerb1 
* **Second**,
Check the bet counter on their site.... so fake.
I've counted 50 000 000 bets in 2 days ! Do you believe that's real ? Of course no.
A ''company'' ready to use such method is shady at best but more certainely scammy. 
Plus, when confronted with that, the owner stated it was real (here:  but some other redditor found out it was a script counting up (here: 
* **Third**,
That's a casino, so basically, even if it was not a ''scam'', it would still be a scam as it is mainly intended to rob naive people of their coins.
In conclusion, everything indicate that it is a SCAM and I really enjoy pointing that out on every thread started to promote it.
Also, the ''person'' behind it tried to discredit me many times by stating I lost money on their casino and was mad about it.... how pathetic is that ? edit: now i'm a competitor ... LOL YEAH try notascamcasino.scam, totally fair, $$$ !!
