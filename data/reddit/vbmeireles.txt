Did you buy it from bitcoin.com?
@_date: 2018-05-06 00:41:51
I'm confident that 1 BTC \&gt; 10k USD by the end of the year. On the other hand, I'm not so confident that there will be a dip big enough to make waiting \(and the risk\) worth it.

I've also heard about BCH market manipulation and I'd appreciate information on that too. Thanks.

If big true
@_date: 2018-05-02 10:17:47
Doesn't price manipulation "exhaust" the manipulator, though? Would you care to explain to me how it works exactly and what its implications are to the near future of BTC?
@_date: 2018-05-04 11:51:17
I'd like to start by stating that I'm an investor in BTC and that these questions are part of a research on its fundamentals. The research's purpose is to help me decide whether I'll want to stay for the short or for the long run.
Q1: From a technical standpoint, do you think BTC has what it takes to be the standard universal cryptocurrency? Do you think it will successfully replace gold? Do you think it will successfully replace cash? Why?
Q2: It's common knowledge that technology advances exponentially. How long do you think BTC \(or whichever you believe will prevail\) will stand before new hardware and technologies make it obsolete because of "Quantum BTC"?

With the closure of 2018Q1 at 9000ish, what are your pessimistic and optimistic predictions for the end of 2018Q2?
@_date: 2018-05-01 18:23:11
I'm confident NASDAQ's participation will drive the price up considerably, but that's in 2018Q4 right?
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:12:58
But isn't that the case with all of the stock markets too? I mean, why people say BTC is being manipulated? I know MtGox has a lot of coins that can drive the price down if sold all at once, but in this case wouldn't they be damaging their own assets?

Assuming your "huh?" wasn't a sarcastic disagreement, I've edited my comment hoping to make it clearer. It was stated by the SEC that (one of) the reason(s) why previous ETF filings were rejected was because of ETF issuers' failure to prove having mechanisms to prevent manipulation.
@_date: 2018-10-24 10:21:23
The SEC approval depends less on price stability/volatility than on proven ability to prevent manipulation.

Rest assured that, in times of downwards movement, "HODL" preachers would've SODL without a thought if it wasn't for their huge FOMO - they're in constant fear that the price will shoot up x100 in the day after they sell. They couldn't care less about the technology. To be fair, it's clear as day that the technology has already won - there are blockchain applications everywhere - so there's nothing really to worry about. HODLers worry over nothing else but the FIAT value of their speculative investment and their hope for adoption is nothing else than the hope that somebody else will pay him more than he did for it.  While I was still getting acquainted with cryptocurrencies I used to come to r/Bitcoin for news. Today I come just to entertain myself with the stuff people come up with when they're going nuts over the price drops. "1 BTC = 1 BTC, so HODL!" was quite funny.

Depending on the situation I do benefit from smaller transaction fees (sometimes none at all) and faster execution, but that wasn't really my question.
What do I gain by using a more expensive coin?
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:07:18
And that will never change, so why HODL?
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:14:40
There's much more than 21 million of other coins that allow me to transfer either 10 or 10 million dollars requiring only a scan and a button press on my phone. Why should I use the most expensive coin and not another, cheaper one?
@_date: 2018-06-27 22:00:17


That's true and will probably stay true. On the other hand, though, the highest possible security (which will always be the most expensive because of the unavoidable laws of economics) isn't necessary for $10 payments. I do believe, though, that Bitcoin is and will continue to be the best for storage and transfer of big amounts.
@_date: 2018-06-27 22:04:00


You do have a point there because from what I've seen so far it is unlikely that there will be another truly decentralized cryptocurrency, since the whole point of people making their own seems to be to make it theirs (to have an enormous headstart in it) in a way or another.
On the other hand, the price of the other coin is irrelevant. The fees (or the cost of the transaction) and the speed of execution/confirmation are extremely relevant.
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:20:13


None. Just like there's no benefit in "buying" the more expensive one either. I'll use whichever suits the opportunity. I was just trying to point out that the fact that there are only 21 million BTC is as meaningless as the price of 1 BTC versus the price of any other coin.

Honest question:
I've been following BTC and the cryptocurrency graphs, markets and news more closely for a couple of months now \- always trying to decide if/when I should buy \- and I'd like to ask a question that I know will probably be unpopular here, but absolutely legitimate.
It is said that BTC will go up a lot more in value as it becomes more widely accepted \(and traditional currencies inflate\) because it is limited in supply. McAfee literally bet his dick that each millionaire in the world would want at least one. I'd even go farther and say that a single BTC would eventually be worth more \(maybe way more\) than a million dollars each if it was the only cryptocurrency. However, looking at the almost two thousand new cryptocurrencies \- a couple quite successful among them \- I ask myself why would people rather not just use another \(maybe a similar, a clone or a different, maybe even "better" one \- though "better" is relative\) cryptocurrency instead of subjecting themselves to this much speculation with BTC's value?
So far it seems to me that BTC is \(at least since I started following it \- and, just to be clear, I'm talking about the cryptocurrency, not about this subreddit\) much more about speculation \(HODL\) than actual usage as payment \- personally, I'd never spend something that can double, quadruple or even x10\+ in value at any moment.
What I'm trying to ask is:
If the goal is to have one \(or more \- look at USD and EUR\) universally accepted decentralized \(anonymous?\) currency/payment system, what makes Bitcoin \(and no other cryptocurrency\) so special? Why would all the millionaires need/want BTC specifically \(which is what needs to happen in order for it to go so high\) instead of any other cryptocurrency who does the same \(or an even better\) job?

I just want to see him eating his dick.
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:39:08
Can somebody explain to me what happened exactly? Are those corporation buy\-ins?
