You're not getting it:
Someone holds your money up, it's a business transaction, you solve business issues like that (generally) through through civil litigation.  Now if there is something more nefarious, then you may talk to a magistrate/attorney general/police and they *may* make criminal charges.
Showing up to someone's house, again, where they live with their family, is a tool move.  Regardless of whatever the BUSINESS issue is, showing up at the CEO's house (who may very well not even be involved in and/or understand what's going on) is going to almost instantly be criminal trespass.
As a matter of practicality, you think if someone feels like you're physically threatening them and your family it would encourage them to resolve the issue?  Do you think a judge would take kindly on that type of behavior?

You don't.


If you did that to me, I would call the cops and talk to an attorney about a restraining order.  
Also, I assuming I had any level of professional experience, would at that point have you discuss things through an attorney and would not want any direct communication.
No one thinking rationally would think this is acceptable behavior.  No one thinking rationally would think this isn't an act of hostility.  Cops show up, tell you to move along, and all you've done is made yourself look like a hothead that was threatening physical harm.  Was that your intention?  Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't, but in situations like this perception is reality and no judge or jury would think you were stopping buy to be polite.

It is a matter of civil litigation and showing up to where someone lives with their family to settle an argument about money is foreplay for criminal legal issues starting with the fact that as soon as they ask you to leave it's criminal trespass.
Want to complain online, file complaints with th3 government,  etc, go for it.  Want to picket them outside the office? Sure.  Taking it personal to where someone lives with their family and you're being a special kind of prick that should be facing criminal charges.

The minute they say leave it is.

As soon as they say "leave" and you don't, it starts at trespassing which probably would just get you a friendly "talk a walk buddy" from the cops.  If you stand your ground and/or keep at it, then it becomes harassment and at some point stalking.  If someone feels threatened after you've asked them to leave alone, the states may very well have different guidelines about it (and countries too for that matter), but again, you have a beef with THE COMPANY, if the person is at home then you have absolutely no right to harass them while they are where they live with their family.


All of them would have families.  No one likes the idea of some lunatic outside their doors harassing them.  There are proper channels to do that in, and 95% of objective third parties would think you're in crazy town following a guy home from work to harass him because you're angry.
And with that, peace.  Keep arguing with yourself if you'd like.
Happy New year and may BTC and crypto profits fall upon us all!

assuming yiu make it to the door, theyd be insane to let you in and even more insane if they didnt just call the cops; coming to someones home to settle a business dispute is very hostile.

It's a civil case, has nothing to do with the IRS or FBI.  Talk to an attorney and file a civil suit, that's the issue.
If there are enough similarly situated, could be class action.

Can you name one viable alternative that makes it so easy to do transactions at low dollar amounts?  Of course ignoring that all of it carries over to gdax.

s9 is 14 TH/s on only slightly more power.  Doesn't seem like a huge deal to me; am I missing something?

To be honest, anyone with significant money rarely has a house that's paid off.  The interest rates are so low if you're getting any type of return on your money it's a no-brainer.  Now that's not to be confused with the "rich" people that work their whole lives, pay off their homes, and live on a modest income, I'm talking about truly wealthy.

I'd be putting it in Monero since privacy is the main concern.

How does a 17 year old buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:23:25
Stripe is huge and they did it for a while, but stopped.  Just because a payment processor will let you use bitcoin, doesn't mean the merchants will adopt it.  More importantly, there are lots of options for merchants to take bitcoin now without having Square process it, so if they want to, they could.
