I'm not gonna lie , I'd spend it on a sailboat or RV or an island.  I simply do not want to work 8-5 jobs anymore with having idiots for bosses.  I want to enjoy life more.  I would also invest more in myself so I can eventually help others out.   So in truth I have both selfish and altruistic reasons.  If you help me out I'd be in your debt.  Thanks for your time.

As a customer I can tell you guys that I LOVE DigitalOcean!!!  As a Bitcoin business, I can say Bitcoin definitely will increase revenue significantly.

If you bought in May 31, 2012; the growth would be about 11,559%.  If you bought in May 31, 2013; growth would be ~370%.  Also interesting to note ~$560 Million USD per day is being sent.  I see bitcoin hitting $1k again before September 2014.

the "fun" for this minor is about to turn into hell and possibly several felonies.

I've been with PayPal since 2000 or early 2001.  Since selling Bitcoin miners via my web store and also on eBay.  PayPal has frozen my funds once and they are now threatening to freeze my funds again (all within a 7 month time-span).   The administrative time sending documents, tracking, business info, supplier info is getting to be a huge pain in the ass.  It seems they wanted this information every 6 months.  Regardless...for now I have to accept paypal to increase sales volume.

I remember downloading the Bitcoin QT wallet in 2010 after reading about it on Slashdot.org....I still had no clue what it did so I gave up on it.  Three more Slashdot articles later, it clicked to me that Bitcoin was  really worth money.  Long story short:  In late 2012, my friend and I decided to mine Bitcoins with GPUs in our utilities included apartments.  My friend / partner sold all of his coins at $80-$130.  I now own NinjaTech, a Bitcoin Miner and Remote NOC / Desktop Services company....we are now pushing revenue in the multi-million dollar realm.

I've been in Bitcoin since late 2012.  My confidence level in Bitcoin has reached an all-time low with this current schism and utterly slow network.  The rate of innovation and development in Bitcoin has slowed to a standstill because of all of the infighting going on.  The current Schism is just plain out not good for Bitcoin in the near future.  Businesses are now withdrawing from Bitcoin as it now takes hours to complete orders.  For example Dell has just removed Bitcoin.  My newegg orders in Bitcoin get cancelled because transaction times take hours or even days sometimes.  This is why other alts like ETH, Dash, Monero and ZEC are gaining on percentage of total market cap.  Like it or hate it, its the truth.  I'll still hold some BTC, but nowhere near as much as before.
EDIT:  Although I was once partners with Jihan Wu and he helped change my life, I do not agree with what he is doing.  Its just plain out bad because it can allow his organization to corner the market. OTOH, Core dev also needs to reach out and be willing to mend the rift before things totally implode.

I was one of Bitmain's very first partners and I have direct connections to those that TSMC and other foundries go to for extra volume.  Shoot me a pm if I could be of any assistance.

 I've also done some research on Craig Wright since last year.  He does indeed seem to be one of the founders of Bitcoin.  Now lets focus on the issue.  If Craig signs a Satoshi block, he opens himself up to legal liability.  Not to mention, he can cause a market panic too.
