It is the same company, if you don't want to get eaten by fees then trade on GDAX, even immediate market orders are only 0.25% when buying on Coinbase is 1.5% and GDAX pays your outgoing BTC transaction fee to your own wallet.

When you create the paper wallet, you will have your own bitcoin address.  After you buy bitcoins on Mt. Gox, to withdraw you simply put in your paper wallet address and after 6 confirmations (about 10 minutes each), the money is verified in your paper wallet address.  To check the contents of your paper wallet, use blockchain.info and type in your address or the blockchain.info wallet with the watch-only feature.
Think of the addresses as bank account numbers more or less.  You're creating a transaction between Mt. Gox account (like a brokerage) to your personal paper wallet (personal checking/savings account).

This is really bad, but think about how useful it could've been if the admins weren't so greedy and shady about this.  Say it was introduced as an opt-in program for those who idle the ESEA client.  
It would be for those who don't want to join a mining pool themselves or without knowledge of Bitcoin.  Extra GPU cycles could mine coins for reduced monthly fees, charity, prize pool, etc.  Kinda like a Folding for PS3 users, but would have a monetary reward.
Think about how perfect of a sample size this is, thousands of online gamers with nice GPU's.  It could have been clean, easy, and fully transparent.  Now, instead of this being commonplace, people are going to be afraid that their systems are compromised for rouge bitcoin mining.
