It’s not retarded to think about the future and ask questions about the principles of how stuff works.

So the fees for each transaction will get bigger and bigger as time goes on? Or they stay the same and it’s just expected that miners process more transactions over time?

Hey, huge thanks! I’ll be sure to read that link.

Ok, now I’m lost. What is the point of this? Why is the transaction time artificially limited to 10 min? Is the 10 min schedule set so we don’t mine out all the bitcoins ahead of schedule (faster than 2140)? Ok kind of get that it is important, but transaction time (and thus ease of use of the currency) limits the adoption rate of the currency. Or security reasons? Something else?
Am I missing somerhing here? Transaction time of 10 min is a big drawback the way I see it. Or when both of us are talking about transaction time, both of us mean a totally different thing?

Thanks! 
A quick followup (sorry for that - just very curious about this topic). So the computing power available grows exponentially each year with the technology available. Are we expecting a point where computational power is not an issue and all transactions are instant? What happens then? Is the just a flat fee per transaction and that’s it.

Oh, sorry my bad. Misread the date. Anyway, the question is still valid.

Ahhhh now it makes sense. I somehow missed that in addition to new bitcoins they get fees. Thanks! 
So a followup. How are calculated? Its a set amount and not dependant on the value of the transaction? Does this amount change over timw or it is set forever? What is the amount?
