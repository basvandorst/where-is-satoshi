Thanks in advance!

not sure I got the same impression from the tweet

I didn't post it a bullet-proof news. Def should be viewed as as speculation/theory. However, IMO, this makes sense, because if you decide to fork out, you probably want to be sure you are in strong majority.

I use  as an aggregator of news and mainly consume info via their channel on Telegram. It is is fast and instead of click-bate titles they use very short and concise ones so 90% of time I don't even have to read the whole piece.

 User must send crypto to your wallet or he can choose any wallet he wants? When public release?

my understanding is that hodl doesn't hold the funds (which is awesome IMO) and doesn't require identification (which is even cooler IMO). Can't buy decentralised currency anymore without showing your ID, hodl brings back bitcoin do its basics. Really excited.

most likely the funniest comment I read on r/bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:00:10
exact same story ! 
@_date: 2017-05-04 12:48:43
Well, the goal was to win within rules, he used rules to his advantage. I didn't read into it as if he praised himself, more like a path for unconventional approach that can be taken in other areas of life/work/etc.
@_date: 2017-05-04 13:07:14
Exactly my thoughts!

I honestly think the whole farce is about making a) bigger blocks b) making HF to keep ASICboost 
@_date: 2017-05-05 08:47:53
here is another shady company he supports: "Roger Ver deleting BitClub tweet"  anything to get hash behind his ideology, makes me sick. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:08:11
same here!
@_date: 2017-05-04 12:39:15
can you give an example ?
@_date: 2017-05-04 12:40:26
yeap, was thinking the same that it took him long enough. Wish that was much sooner, but anyways finally it is happening.
@_date: 2017-05-04 10:32:04
you know, dude! you know.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:45:31
to my limited technical capacities I understand that there is a big difference with Segwit block increase (making more space in block) vs 2mb increase (making block bigger). Also, from readings I've done it seems that softfork will "brake" ASICBoost, while HF will keep it in place. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:49:45
right and 3)  "Im not even sure this kind of thing should be considered immoral-- majority hashpower acting selfishly for their own economic benefit (both short and long term) is the basic incentive structure that makes Bitcoin work"
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:50:47
me too!
@_date: 2017-05-04 13:25:43
Has anybody left in the space, who has been knowledgeable, respected AND neutral ? *wink-wink*
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:56:54
I think you should make it a reddit post about it. I don't think I am qualified enough to answer that but I have been asking this myself many times and my philosophical rather than factual answer is: some people just want to be "right" or "win" even when it costs them fortunes.
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:40:46
IMHO he has discredited himself on several occasions:
1)  - you asked to be specific, but I really don't want to start another episode of holly war, but I cannot not mention the fact that he suggested to run buggy and untested soft that has been proven to be unstable.
2)  - and this. Okay, you can be BU supporter and disagree with me on point 1, but this is major loss of credibility in my book i.e. supporting outright con artist
@_date: 2017-05-04 14:31:39
Vinny would be good too, I agree! 
@_date: 2017-05-05 08:40:18
I am impressed that a random conversation on the interwebs got to be so meaningful, thank you, sir! Point you made makes sense and I do agree that the 2 statements are very much alike (you ninja-brained and it always cool!). Probably, my personal dislike of Gavin got best of my rational thinking, I still hope it's not him since my first choice would be Vinny or Andreas, but very cool serve by you.
@_date: 2017-05-04 10:08:33
good thinking! hope that is Andreas indeed!
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:26:47
 - should be here after it is released
@_date: 2017-05-05 08:33:36
well, fuck :( (thanks for the info)

Check blocks: 477016, 477008, 477005, 477006 on xbt.eu - all of these are marked as "No" for Witness Commitment on the source.
@_date: 2017-05-04 11:29:06
Always surprised  to hear that, but just out curiosity can you elaborate why you hate the guy? 
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:01:40
Nope, I can verify that he has Russian name/surname
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:58:23
source ?
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:30:16
My respect for them came from a long-term vision that they shared with community and core team, seems they traded it off for some short-term gain. Not a dev myself and I am openly relaying on a higher authority here - seems like 2mb HF is a bad solution for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:40:33
thank you for the information! I hope you are right and I am wrong, but IMHO I think Alex Petrov as individual is very pro-segwit, where as BitFury as business may have jumped ship. Also I think guys in BitFury are way too smarted to be fooled by Jihan and Co. Finally, I hope that they will support BIP148 as they say.
@_date: 2017-05-04 16:16:43
That would be a disaster 
@_date: 2017-05-04 10:08:01
nah, Tim is open-minded and quite an anti-establishment (to a point) himself, IMHO this should be good for Bitcoin.

I repeat:
