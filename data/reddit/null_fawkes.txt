Now that I understand how this works moreoless, I think this guy is both skilled and stupid. Did he really though that he could just get away with that? 
Oh! I found a exploit, let me steal EVERYTHING instead of doing small trasactions and getting decent amounts form time to time. 
Best case scenario for him, getting millions out of the blue in your bank account, how the hell do you even explain that to the tax office??

Stealing is stealing but I don't know how was the robbery made. If the money lost was spent by people on drugs, I don't see how you would go to the police. I guess they just have to wait and hope for tje best. And... to be honest... I don't know If I feel pitty anymore for the ones who lost money in that way. I didn't know the web was about drugs.

I don't think a guy who can steal millions was doing all the cracking directly from* his network.

Thanks, I don't know either. Maybe they didn't understand that I disliked that guy?
I saw a comment when I was looking on various /r/ related about the true objective about bitcoin, and for me I think it's how it's going to work: Just use it as much as you can, is not all about how much a BTC is worth in other currencies but to make it avaiable everywhere.
Maybe when the popularity of the Bitcoin is not that of the ones who got rich, but how is it used all around the world those who don't understand it may be more open to it.

As interesting as this is, man this sucks. The internet is the internet after all.
Is there really any way to stop him?

Well, of course is one of the most impressive things about this if we are honest. I can't blame them. Of course I'd like money, anyone would. But I really hope this becomes the standard. 
Maybe after I start using bitcoins I'll allow myself to judge the way some see bitcoins, because see, so far I tried to tip some guy and I couldn't even pay the fees, who am I to talk about how to use bitcoins for now? And to be honest, thanks to the investors a lot of us know about bitcoins too. 
I hope this changes soon, though!
