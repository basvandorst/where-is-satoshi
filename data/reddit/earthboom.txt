Or! Or!
...some alt coins have better tech behind them that make bitcoin look like the outdated piece of tech that it is? 
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:38:38
By that logic it's better than bitcoin too. Let's compare coin to coin.

Never actually thought about it like that. Interesting. Wonder if it's fear driven or just giving everyone an opportunity to buy in before they change the rule and let it skyrocket.

At some point you have to have a little faith and go along with it. Moving the goal post further and further out does more harm than good. Short of him standing before you so you could do a biopsy, what's enough proof of life? Security experts and paranoid people will always question everything he says or does fearing the worst.

Bitcoin is a want driven asset. No one needs it, but we all want what it can do for us and that's make us rich.
Idle worry free hands invest in bitcoin. No one invests their last fifty bucks into it, but someone who just got a raise does.
The recent government crackdowns halted bitcoins growth. All of these exchanges getting investigated further halted everything.
So what will make it go up again? Exchanges need to be trustworthy again, governments need to chill (they won't), and hands need to be bored holding fiat.
Two out of those three might happen again, but governments won't let this market go unregulated. It will go up with government oversight and regulation and if it's one thing government does is make everything lame and boring.
If it falls under government control, expect a slow and controlled rise and many plateaus.
But if bitcoin is needed...similar to how Venezuelans need an alternate currency...or the Chinese need a way to get their fortunes out...well that'll spike the price for sure.
The Chinese will need a way for their fortunes to escape the rule of law as always, they're just waiting for a safe way. The west doesn't need bitcoin save for the criminal element and that's only a subset of the population.
What's worse is Wallstreet is playing with it now too and they've been playing stocks longer than most of us have been alive. They can manipulate prices very easily. The next spike will be amazing and many people will get rich overnight, but will it be a controlled spike or a random one?
I think too many people know about it to leave the market to chance especially when so many people with big pockets are involved. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:03:31
Wouldn't the mass amount of people selling it right away drive the price up? 
@_date: 2019-02-18 22:31:31
Real life problem. Will the stripper industry resist bitcoin serving as a hard anchor for fiat? Will they take paper wallets? Will they throw *their* paper wallets in the hope of someone tipping them? Will the erection be lost whilst trying to get a good enough signal to load electrum send the coin, wait for her to receive it before she continues knobbin on your block chain? Or will the patron experience a soft fork? Idk. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:57:28
It's not. It's the gatekeeper. You have to go through it to get to the other coins. That's the only reason it's still relevant.

All of r/bitcoin was. They all had this gif and were all waiting for the day they could post this gif.

Sorry, don't know what I was thinking. You're right. Everyone selling would lower the price. No one would really be buying that coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:56:41
You can't. Plain and simple. There's some vendors where you can buy some stuff, but the answer is you can't. You still need fiat for quite a lot of things. Until you can buy gas, groceries, and other necessities, bitcoin still has a fight ahead of it. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:34:48

So you need fiat to pay the government so you can use this alternative currency.
Taxes *is* control. It keeps fiat relevant. GG.
Until you can pay your taxes in bitcoin or other government services, fiat will remain relevant and with it control will stay in the hands of the government.

If you're in the US, it counts for capital gains tax. Recent rulings allowed the IRS to get their paws on it. Gotta pay the tax on the profit you made, or they'll start wondering why you're getting an undocumented stream of income going into your account.

Buy more stuff with bitcoin because you're saving money at that point if I understand correctly, right? 
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:29:41
There's no need for experienced trading. Bitcoin will rise anyway it's a matter of getting rich now versus later. 
@_date: 2016-09-04 17:46:07
So what everyone is talking about here is take the bitcoins and keep them (just like any other promising cryptocurrency) in the hopes of mainstream adoption where the coin will skyrocket. In this way, bitcoin is an investment (again, like any of the other coins). However, the part I don't get is the spending it. Why do I want to spend some of my bitcoins? I understand that depending on the value, I can purchase low, wait for a price jump, use the coins to purchase other coins when *they're* low (effectively maximizing my initial purchase) wait for a price hike there, exchange it back into BTC when it does (ideally during a down trend in BTC) and repeat the cycle creating a nice bit of growth simply day trading. 
I see that part of spending, but others have mentioned it's for the good of bitcoin? Then I've been reading about Amazon cards and bypassing fees and such?
Could you clarify for me what people mean by hold most of it and then spend a bit and resupply? 
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:30:09
It's not collapsing? Zoom out on the graph. It's steadily going up with dips here and there. Every rise has a rip and every dip has a rise. It's not going anywhere. Everyone that got burned or missed the boat with the last rise is waiting for it to bottom out before going all in resulting in a much bigger rise than before.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:25:42
Not really. Ideally with a stable bitcoin, diversifying in other crypto would see a rise in the price of one or more dependent on value. 
It's unfortunate bitcoin is the gatekeeper. Once you can purchase and trade with another crypto directly, this bs of bitcoin having a say in the price of everything else can end.

There's arguments for both. Only time will tell. The argument for it being a bubble is compelling but they're saying the ceiling is 8000 before it drops.

Fascinating. Is the chance of this being real hike rather than a bubble minimal? Are we sure this will pop. I want to buy some bags. For my friend.

You can't day trade unless you're a broker and you need a license for that. If you do day trade, you're allowed like 5 transactions a week. If you want a live feed of the stock exchange, that'll cost you. Insider trading is also illegal, something that happens regularly in crypto. 
Regulations put in place to prevent all things wrong with the crypto world. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 04:58:03
How is coinbase? Lots of verification and waiting? Hassle for US customers? Good price? 
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:38:25
I keep an excel spreadsheet for this reason, but is there a way to look at the price of BTC historically? I got lazy with my last purchase and didn't write down the price. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:10:43
I chuckled 
@_date: 2017-07-11 08:17:17
Dude where are you getting this 
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:52:29
Sorry I should clarify, the day trade limits are when you get identified as a pattern trader. At which point if you don't have at least $25000 in equity, you can't trade. It's a minimum buy in sort of thing. 
Even then, you're limited on how much you can earn on that day and you can't dip below that amount. 
 
As far as how far behind it is, enough to lose to robo traders which is a good chunk of the people trading anymore. It's not the 90s, but it is in the crypto world. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:49:34
I keep reading warnings like this but they get buried under people who just want to celebrate. It's so ridiculous. I don't know much, but even I understand this whole miners locking in doesn't actually mean anything. 
There's still room for mischief and things can still go sour. I know in a few days and then in a few weeks, if everything goes alright, we should celebrate, but until then, this is blind premature and naive...yet so many people are doing it. I hope nothing bad happens.

The information they ask for and you provide is there for these companies to cover themselves. Should they get audited, or should they get compelled to release user information, they have it. If a website promotes privacy and anonymity and don't ask for that information, they become a magnet for criminals and nefarious users, worst still, they get used as a money laundering service, as a pump and dump scheme, and the list goes on. 
It used to be this way when bitcoin first started. Coin washing services were all over the place, and in a way, that's what allowed the silk road to thrive as much as it did. Authorities didn't like that regardless of how *noble* the need for privacy and anonymity is. 
However, should you still be concerned over anonymity and privacy, you can still get bitcoin anonymously any number of ways. After that, shapeshift doesn't require any sign up information, but they do log each transaction and can bring up records at any given point, proving it was you would still be difficult if you do it right. 
But the more I go into detail about this, the more it feels like I'm giving specific instructions for criminals, because they're the ones who benefit directly. The average user with privacy concerns is less than the amount of criminals as of right now. 
There are coins that have anonymity cooked in, and even if you sent those coins to an exchange and withdrew bitcoin under your name, they couldn't prove you purchased the anonymous coin to begin with. 
The whole thing is tricky, but to answer your question, exchanges use it for liability and to see what fees apply to you. If you're an honest citizen playing with tech or an investor looking to make a buck, who cares? 
If the exchanges sold or gave your information away, they would come under fire, their reputation would take a hit and everyone would move to a different exchange. It's not in their best interests to double dip. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:07:23
I guess...they didn't kill crypto anonymity. It's still possible. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:15:24
BTC is the gate for other cryptos. They depend on BTC to be increasing to get more alt coins. If it's tanking like it is, people wait to buy in until BTC is stabilized, which means miners are generating alt coins that no one is buying, flooding the market. There'll be another surge once all of this is done, but not until August 1st me thinks. BTC is in a world of hurt and the pain won't end until well after August. Then you can expect the prices to begin climbing slowly. BTC will need to recover and gain trust, which will take a while too. The more alt coins bypass BTC, the less power BTC holds over them, and the more opportunity for another coin to come along and say "I won't have that problem."
What's happening to bitcoin is a desperate move to stay relevant. Going forward, it'll become more and more difficult to compete with alt coins that are built better from the getgo until eventually development for BTC might stop all together as another coin takes over. 
The king is sick and all his princes are looking to take over.
