Bitcoins thing was minute or two after the ECB announcement so it was not causation. When these things are announced, reactions are instant.... Like under a few miliseconds.

No this is commercial banking, not effecting the consumer. Its just a way to push banks to loan more money rather than depositing with the ECB...

Hate to say it but how would an IT guy, an engineer, programmer, whatever.... have been able to do his job and undoubtedly live his life without hearing on bitcoin as he claims to have heard it first in Feb 2014... I doubt that.... I really doubt that. Too innocent. He is satoshi!!! :)
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:25:20
Indeed. This is commercial banking, this isn't interest for the retail saver. It just means its incentive for banks to loan their money out in the economy and overnight deposits in ECB will be penalized.

Tbh, most real brokers wouldn't open themselves to exposure like that. I think if a client comes in and sells BTC with them they'll hedge it off on the market, basically they have the knowledge to do so meaning the client doesn't. Therefore it may actually impact the way the BTC market works.
If this being the case any large USD holder cna fuck these guys over like so:
- Deposit a million USD
- Buy BTC with them, thus making their position short exposure risk
- They have to run to the market to cover their position's risk so they buy BTC
- Their covering drives price up
- You start to sell over the next hour as the BTC markets rally like they always do for about an hour.

That would be correct. Ultimately they plan to do all their compliance AML/KYC out of Bermuda. 
"The company has links with Bermuda. It has a unit incorporated here, called Binance (Bermuda) Ltd, and has plans to develop its global compliance base on the island, creating 40 jobs, and to develop a digital asset exchange in Bermuda “as soon as practicable”."

What.Cd the largest private tracker in the world for music accepts Bitcoin.
BTN is regarded as the best for TV has accepted bitcoin.
PTP the most reputed film tracker also accepts bitcoin.
Most of these large trackers basically accept it already just now BTN has just made it the primary donation source. That may come to bite them in the ass however as lets face it, its still one extra step to do something people may already be reluctant to do in the first place (donate).

Nah not really. Its all trust. Not your average joe. Trust is the reason I can pick up the phone right now and call ***** and sell a million canadian dollars and go short.

BTC-E is great as far as exchange stuff goes. however their wire fees are kind of crazy. 150$ minimum fee :( OK for big money but from small players its cray cray. OK PAY is like 0% and all but dealing with OKPAY so far has been expensive on their end. (Wire OKPAY 200$ and they deduct 12$ already).

I've never been a radical before. AWESOME!
@_date: 2013-10-08 19:57:20
Still, betting any amount on a 50/50 outcome when a betting round goes live is crazy out of whack. If you see one side has 10 BTC on it and the other has 1BTC thats like saying you are accepting 1/11 odds for a 50/50 outcome whcih is stupid. Long story short if anyone is reading this - Always bet on the weak side. ALWAYS. in the long run you WILL win as at the start house cut is 0% so you are taking pure 50/50 odds (if the sites regression line is fair).

I've seen plenty of seizures before and yeah - They've never done this in any case before... At first I was skeptical, then once mainstream news outlets reported it I just let it slide... But damn this makes me start to question it again. That being said... For such an elaborate plan (if it were faked) DPR wouldn't slip up with something like a seizure notice when there are plenty of examples of what a 'real' one looks like. And surely once outlets like BBC start reporting it the FBi would have called them to say its fake.

I guess this is the same as people using bad cheques then. My concern was thinking of it along the lines of a credit card, where a credit card will decline if you don't have the funds, but I guess your bitcoin wallet will also decline. 
Is a double spend as simple as going to a restaurant with 1BTC in your account, buying 1BTC of food, run next door and also buy something with 1BTC?

@_date: 2013-10-09 01:36:02
Dude it is logical. If I agreed with you then we would both be wrong. You come in see 1btc on the other side - this is all hypothetical. You bet 1btc on the other side. Now you are risking 1btc for the chance to win 1 btc. That's fair. Now some crazy looney comes in and sticks 100btc on your side as well. No one else does the other side because no one else is that crazy. You now are risking your full stake of 1btc for the chance to win like. 0.009btc.... A far cry from the 1 for 1 considering no odds have changed. It's not a valid form of betting when someone can litwrally devalue your bet against your will. 
I hope that clears it up a little.

The stake size has nothing to do with the odds though. Some broke person could come in put down .01BTC risk on side A. and so can a few twenty others. Then some rich people come along and put a total of twenty bets on side B - with 50/50 odds. The rich people are wayyyy at a disadvantage. For side A risks like .2BTC and stands to win 100BTC, while for the same odds Side A can lose .2BTC and side B can win .2BTC. Thats not how betting works so this site isn't going to work without a bankroll. Also the sites Payout calculator is inherently wrong.
@_date: 2013-10-08 18:52:59
That's what I thought. This is a nice idea - but without a bankroll its completely unworkable idea for betting sadly.

Its not a liquidity crunch. The liquidity is the market depth. If there are more sellers than buyer, the price will fall until more buyers come in at that price level. That's how the current price is so high, there are more buyers than sellers. The price is being PUSHED higher by buyers, not pulled higher by sellers.

BTN is a no-ratio tracker. But yes donating gives you upload credit (But its meaningless since its a ratio free tracker).
As far as profiting from piracy - thats a greasy business to be in. In the past most trackers caught doing that have been abandoned, so either the ones remaining are those which do not profit or those which are very good at hiding it. Personally I feel that what.cd, btn, ptp are fairly transparent with their budgets and with all the admin staff I find it hard to believe there would have been no whistle blowers to date if they were stealing donation funds.
@_date: 2013-10-08 19:30:01
the odds are 50-50 so if you came in with 100BTC at 50-50 odds then you should stand to double or lose. Not lose all or win a tiny fraction depending on how much was risked on the other side of the bet. Site won't work. Also the sites Payout calculator is inherently wrong.
@_date: 2013-10-08 22:18:19
you don't. But as soon as bets start coming in, if you see one side get out of line quickly then its within your interest to take it.
@_date: 2013-10-08 19:59:40
Or you had a large bankroll and no one on the other side matches it. OR you bet fairly then someone comes in with a huge bankroll and basically devalues your bet completely by betting with you on your side and taking the majority of the profits.
