How long do you intend to hold? In less than 2 weeks there will be a decision on the ETF. If it is approved, you can expect the price to at least double. If it is denied, we'll probably see a small dip to around 900-1000, but I expect it to recover quickly and continue to rise slowly.

Welcome and congratulations. Next step would be learning how to secure your coins via Cold Storage and/or Hardware Wallet.

if you are in the US, buy bitcoins on GDAX as a market maker to avoid paying fees. 
I use Electrum as my desktop and mobile wallet, though i keep most of my coins in cold storage (google electrum cold storage). I also encrypt and back up all my wallet seeds.
i havent found the need for a hardware wallet yet as I keep just a couple hundred bucks on my hot wallets and my savings/investments in cold storage.

also 0 fees as a maker. i've been day trading on gdax and not paying a single cent in fees. i don't know of any other exchange that offers this.
