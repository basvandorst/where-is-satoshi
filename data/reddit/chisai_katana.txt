Maybe ‘digital gold’ is a better analogy. Your private key is the key to your private digital gold vault. You are your own bank that owns that vault.
Maybe ‘smart contracts’ on blockchain is more analogous to what a bank ( and other ‘middlemen’ entities ) provide.

Just make sure you are diversified with not too much in government fiat, so maybe...Crypto, gold, silver, land etc..

Yup, this guy gets it.
Huge inflation in asset prices. Which will be followed by everyday high street prices, and a collapse of the dollar etc..
22 trillion USD debt is knocking on the door.. and .gov needs to inflate it away

Plot the 1 year log graph for BTC, kinda puts this current drop in perspective, just another blip.

Well thats a nice little bounce, back over 13k....15k next would be nice :D

Probably some support at 10k, but depends if the real fear and frenzy starts. I’ve positioned myself 50-50 going into next year, meaning I took out all my original investment plus a heap of healthy profit after selling 50% of my overall crypto holdings, leaving 50% in for any possible moon shoots next year. Risk off and Feeling good.
