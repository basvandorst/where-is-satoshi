I second this one, would be curious to hear how much they've received as the community consistently encourages eachother to tip to Wikipedia.

Libra is a lot faster and cheaper to move than Bitcoin.  Same when compared to the US dollar. It is superior in ways that make it practical for mass adoption.

Saying money is 50% of transactions implies that it is inherently vulnerable. What happens when you have 51%? You have your own money.

The evolution of money and government will be very interesting. I think the pendulum swings between centralization and decentralization, we're currently swinging towards the latter - and then it'll go back again. 
The US government isn't incapable of making a currency that has a net positive effect on its citizens - yet it is unlikely. Maybe the next government will do a better job. We will see a major corporation, like Facebook, make the first steps on the road to
mainstream crypto adoption.

Nice browser, I just tested the bidirectional wallet a few weeks ago and withdrew what I earned from watching ads into bank account. You can transfer BAT to Bitcoin when withdrawing too.

Yep, Android for now, iOS should be working within the next week or so according to their Github

Right, it's like a rocket, lots of people will suffer due to its creation but it will still get us to the moon.
Or you could see it as the Sheriff in town, he might abuse his authoritative power, but he'll still protect your community.

You didn't counter how the quantum threat would be addressed, ~7 years isnt a long time. 
A lot of people thought you couldnt shut down Napster, it no longer exists. But, instead of that snake that you referred to, it turned out to be a hydra and many other heads sprung up in its place. Bitcoin is pretty much Napster, will its fate be similar?
Facebook has already released some of the code, and other companies have bootcamps on how to develop with it.

Its acceptance will legitimize crypto. Expect adoption of other crypto to happen a lot faster when Libra goes mainstream.
Abuse of power is inescapable. It may be able to survive in certain environments but never thrive if it is a big enough threat. Look at what happened with P2P music sharing.
 
Bitcoin is a good stepping stone to where we want to go but it's not the end all be all.

Anyone in JAX interested in getting a MeetUp started again? I just started one around Brave/BAT but it doesn't need to be that specific. 
Most of the groups here haven't met up in a while it seems. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 15:05:27
I would imagine so. It depends on how it affects the government's ability to regulate and monitor current transactions, which I don't have much insight on. If the consensus of the community is to morph the currency into a 'privacy coin' then it would be treated as such. 
I didn't know about Taproot and Schnoor until now, very interesting, thank you.
@_date: 2019-12-07 03:32:21
They should probably mention that this is an alternative.
@_date: 2019-01-01 03:26:52
Right now I can use it to directly (and automatically) tip content creators and whoever else has a wallet. It already serves a purpose, we can continue to seek a bigger purpose for this too. Getting a few extra BAT to watch ads is just icing on the cake. Amazon Turk can be gamed by using various methods to trick the system, yet it is still a thriving ecosystem. All if this is hypothetical, we'll just have to wait until it's released to the public to find out who's right. Enjoy the new year! Crypto has a bright future regardless of what happens ��

I'm surprised that you think Libra is not going to happen. This is going to be a trend from most big governments/corporations. There's a wave of government and corporate-issued crypto coming. Facebook's ties with the government of the US, and of the world, run deep. Do not underestimate their influence.

B as in Basic Attention Token, got it. Mothership, initiate plan B. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 06:04:49
Yes but the adblockers do nothing to counter the effect this has on the content creator. If you're going to block a source of revenue for the content creator then you should be responsible for opening up another channel. This is what Brave/BAT does.
@_date: 2018-12-30 02:36:50
They are going to have to have a certain amount of control in order to prevent abuse.
Also, it's called a user growth pool, they can only recycle funds that they gave away to their users. These funds were not bought by the user so if they're not claimed within a certain period of time they should go back to Brave. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 19:36:56
The Brave browser is the best solution to this problem, imagine being able to tip websites and your favorite content creators in real-time. This is going to happen, we should thank PayPal and Patreon for speeding this process up.
@_date: 2018-12-29 19:44:58
This is a high quality post and you should feel good for posting it.

You're giving out your attention and browsing habits when you visit a website, this information has value and people aren't currently getting paid for it. The time will come when people realize their data and time is valuable and there will be no going back. Brave is already working with what is. People are getting paid for watching ads. The cat is out of the bag, good luck putting it back in. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 03:47:52
Brave lets you surf and blocks ads automatically, it will also pay you if you choose to watch them. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 19:59:39
This is already a huge problem in the advertisement industry, a recent report said about 50% of all internet traffic is fake. Privacy abuse is another huge problem. At least they're trying to do something. Your argument is saying that people are going to try to game the system by getting free payouts from Brave. That doesn't sound like a disaster, worst case scenario - they fail, best case - users get paid more, content creators get paid more, users have more control over their data, and the crypto community can chalk up another victory. We should be doing whatever we can to make sure something like this is successful.
And you're assuming that human/bot detection techniques won't improve in this space, it does seem like a difficult problem to solve but to declare it a failure before it goes public is definitely premature. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 17:14:46
I know what it is but I am not sure how it's relevant here?
@_date: 2018-12-31 18:34:27
Fraud happens in every industry, to say Brave's model can't work because others have failed before them is like saying the concept of paper money would never work when it was first implemented. It can be abused and counterfeited but we learned from mistakes in the past and have benefited tremendously from it.  
@_date: 2018-12-29 19:37:32
It's going to change the entire industry and upset a lot of people profiting off the status quo
