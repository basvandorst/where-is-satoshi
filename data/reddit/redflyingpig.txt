I would like to sell my BCC so I use Electron Cash to retrieve  my BCC. All goes well except that the BTC transfer I made on Aug 5th (shown as a BCC txn here) is showing as an unconfirmed transaction in Electeon Cash (it certainly got confirmed on the BTC blockchain long ago), therefore, it always gives me this error msg saying 'insufficient fund' no matter how much BCC I try to transfer out. But this last transaction seems never getting confirmed. What shall I do? THANK YOU!

I'm not saying otc is the only channel.

Good luck with your shiny little coin in your wonderful ivory tower where everybody fights for the prosperity of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Life in China sucks compared to western countries and Chinese do lie a lot, but this is the real world you and your ancestors may have put behind you like 200 years ago, and you should be a grown-up and face it, because you all will become more and more like us. That's how something called evolution works.

Or via OTC, which they are already doing. We can see many people in the otc market constantly selling. They don't earn as much as selling overseas, they'll leave a bit margin for the arbitragers.

1, no more cny inflow to the exchanges anymore, so just the funds already in there playing around. 2, there's a personal annual quota to convert fcy tp cny, and 3, Bitfinex is having trouble with their usd withdrawal. So you need to be really lucky to have all 3 obstacles cleared.

What you are saying has nothing to do with my post. Feel free to start your own.

Apparently most of the people here are busy laughing at the China ban and cheering the price bounce without knowing why. So I guess not.

The community is getting diluted, like any other communitu gettimg mainstream attention, and it's a good thing. This is how Bitcoin like an organic creation, grow itself. Don't overreact.

This should be the fall I was talking about.

I say just bring it on, and let the market decide. Bitcoin is not something you 'protect', but rather something you burn and hammer until it shines.

I don'y really think Bitmain is the primary reason behind the dip this time, given the limited population who give a shit.

I dont think the dip is over yet, since China is still waiting for the other boot to drop when the June regulation is announced, although FOMC has already pull some funds from market. Then comes the black Aug 1st. So fasten your seatbelts fellas.

For hodler's yes, but many will decide to sell out before the big day, isn't it?
