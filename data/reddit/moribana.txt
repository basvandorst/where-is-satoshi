Others already pointed out why the comparison to TVs is not justified. On the other hand, you are right that as long as the mined and traded amount are comparable, bitcoin price will not increase. In other words, while this is the case, supply and demand are roughly in balance, prices do not change. 
In fact, at this moment, wider adoption probably means lower prices. This is because most of the btc spent is mined (maybe now maybe earlier)  and miners have more places to spend. Spent btc is then traded for $ by the companies that sell things for btc. This creates btc supply on the market and drives the price down.
On the other hand, if at some later point many people were to buy btc for $ and then spend that btc and a real btc economy were to emerge, that would create pressure on the other side. The fixed amount of btc would need to hold the price of larger and larger amounts of goods and services and the price would go up. However, I think that we are still far from that point. I do not see much incentive to turn $ into btc and spend the btc. The disadvantages outweigh the advantages.

Could you quote the source of your information? Or is it speculation based on Gox's recent behavior?
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:43:49
This is why I asked because I also have no direct evidence. However, Gox acts like it is broke. Fiat withdrawals have been very hard for a long time and now even btc withdrawal is halted. And all this without any plausible explanation. I think that at this point it is not a very far-fetched conclusion that there is a high probability that they are indeed broke. So I would not call it exactly fud...
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:27:22
As long as it is in your Gox account you do not own the btc. You own a claim that gox owes you the btc. It is exactly like depositing money into your bank account. You don't own it because if for any reason the bank decides not to pay it back to you, you will never get it. You own money only if you have physical bank notes in your hand. The same with btc. You own it only if you have it in your wallet on your computer.

Fun fact: Hungary is a rip off.
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:41:00
"Exploiters were convincing gox CS that their btc withdrawals hadn't gone through, and being re-sent bitcoin for months. This part is known to be true. "
This is really interesting. I am not up to date in this story. Can you give the source?
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:37:40
Sure, when you deposit your money in a vank you just own a claim. However, banks are known to operate on the basis of fractional reserve. Everybody knows that and this is regulated by the law (which does not make it good but at least when you deposit, you are aware of that).
An exchange like Gox should be fundamentally different, as they are not supposed to give out loans. Which means that whatever is deposited remains there until withdrawn. The only way this could change is if the operators take out some funds and use them for something else. My point is that by its nature Gox should not be able to do fractional reserve banking. Either funds are there or they are stolen.
So it seems the only evidence for Gox funds having stolen is indirect, from their behavior. Well, that is already quite strong evidence...

But this is ridiculous. If I operate a money exchange, sell dollars to someone who then buys drugs for those dollars, am I liable? No way. Why is it different with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:43:30
There is no way you can store real money in your computer "wallet" (you can store it only in your physical wallet that is in your pocket :-) However, you can spend bitcoin straight from your bitcoin wallet without converting it to dollars. There are now many companies that sell stuff for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:56:04
OK, I understand that there were withdrawals that did not go through immediately. But is there any evidence of "double withdrawals" when someone actually got the btc and then asked it to be sent again which again went through?
@_date: 2014-10-12 21:06:45
You can get cheap things in Budapest but they are mostly crap. Budapest is a rip-off.
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:47:13
But this is how all exchanges work. Have you noticed that even if you walk into a brick and mortar bank to exchange, first you have to hand over the cashier your money. For a minute or two you don't own the money. And then they give you in exchange a different currency and then you own the money again. This is exactly what happens in a btc exchange. Except that "handing over" the money and "getting back" the btc takes a bit longer. But not much longer if you do not leave it in the exchange.
By the way, it is the same with online wallets. And I have no idea why people keep btc there.

This guy seems to be very confused about some basic notions of law and economics. No wonder, he is a professor of law...
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:26:20
Mining just adds one more step to the process. Most likely you join a pool and after a while you have enough btc in your pool account to have it sent to your wallet. Then from your wallet you transfer it to an exchange where you sell it for $. Then you transfer the $ to your bank account.

If you backed up wallet.dat and have it (also on another disk), you should have control over your coins.

This is all fine but they would need to properly communicate it. Otherwise people start speculating. Anyway, we'll see whether some people got cheap coins now or no coins at all...

If all else fails you can check on blockchain.info what the change addresses are where your change went. It is probably a change address (or more change addresses) where you will find your missing btc. Change addresses are not shown by qt, I do not know whether they are dumped by default.

Bitstamp is up and running. It is just their bank processing fiat transactions that is closed for the long weekend. Small amounts of automatic (not manually processed) transactions should still go through instantaneously.

I don't quite get this "parity with gold". What is so special about one _ounce_ of gold? I think that the only meaningful thing here to compare is market capitalization. And in this respect bitcoin is about 0.1% of that of gold.

This is what they say:
"Not regarding to withdrawal method, a fee will be displayed before executing the withdrawal and deducted from amount. SEPA withdrawals are charged with fixed 0.90€ fee once your funds are converted to EUR. Minimum amount for SEPA withdrawal is $10.00. International withdrawals are charged with 0.09% fee, minimum fee is $15.00. Minimum amount for international withdrawal is $50.00."
I think what confuses some people is that by "international withdrawal" they mean non-SEPA intl. withdrawals. That is when the 0.09% fee applies. For SEPA withdrawals there is only a 0.9 EUR fixed fee.
At least this is how I understand it. I haven't tried to withdraw yet.
 This does not sound too bad to me, given the fact that my home bank charges a minimum fee of over 5 EUR for a SEPA transfer!

Simple reason. Even though difficulty is going up, the bitcoin price has been increasing much faster lately. So the btc price of miners might be falling but the USD price can still go up. They are not worth anyway...
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:45:27
Are you sure, it does not matter? If you suddenly get rid of half the money in the system, the value of one unit increases doesn't it? Of course, the whole economy still functions, just the units are different. But if you invested in bitcoin, your investment will be worth more in terms of goods you can buy.
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:30:38
You need some incentive to keep enough computers on the network to maintain copies of the blockchain. And also there must be some way of distributing bitcoins when they are created. Dou you have a better proposal? I am really curious to hear.
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:27:21
This sounds like the perfect scam. If the price of btc goes up, they sell it and refund your $ saying you are high risk. If the btc price goes down, you get your bitcoins.
There is one thing I do not understand. On other sites (like bitstamp) you cannot even put funds in your account before they verify you. Once verified, you submit your funds and trade. Then there is no way they could reverse any trade saying you are high risk since they already verified you. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:56:05
I completely agree. One of the obstacles to the widespread use of bitcoin is a user friendly and safe interface. With the currently available apps there are really so many pitfalls. Eg. it took me some time to figure out that even though I received all my btc to a single address, it is not enough to have control over that address. This is because of the change addresses that are generated "under the hood" without you knowing about it. There are many people who learned this in the hard way. 
Sure, all this information is available somewhere but it is really far from being as simple as using your credit card. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:55:49
blockchain.info shows that you have almost 0.7btc in this address and there was no outgoing transaction:
So you still must have the whole amount.
@_date: 2013-12-17 11:11:20
This is the most up to date thread on bitcointalk:
The bottom line so far is that you can withdraw about 6% of your funds stuck, using this link:
  
and your WeEx userid and passwd. This really works, I successfully withdrew.
There is still no information on what exactly happened, only promises that the rest will be also paid back at some point in the future.

Assuming that on average all mined coins are sold. This might not be true.

@_date: 2013-10-30 21:56:06
Same here. Tried to withdraw 1btc and it is pending. Surely does not qualify as a large amount to be processed manually. This should go through instantaneously and automatically. Otherwise it defeats the whole point of using bitcoin. This practice is absolutely unacceptable imo.
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:37:57
I think that currently the most important problem is not the fees. Suppose you want to send money cheap and fast. Even if you assume that both the sender and the recipient have an account on an exchange, the transaction involves two normal bank transfers with all the time it takes and fees. Not to mention the risk that the rate changes in the meantime. 
On the other hand if bitcoin really takes off and you can use it basically anywhere and most people own some by default...it is a very different matter. Then it will be very fast and efficient because no transfer and conversion of fiat is needed.
@_date: 2013-11-03 22:11:56
Be careful with change addresses. Even if you received all your funds on a single address, some of your funds might be available under different addresses. This is because when you spend btc change can come back to different addresses in your wallet and those addresses are not shown by bitcoin-qt. You can check on blockchain.info how much is associated to your primary address.

Thanks. But this still doesn't explain everything. They are only talking about bank issues which should only affect fiat transfers in and out. There is also some news about a DDoS attack. But the site itself is still basically inaccessible. People have their orders and cannot modify them and it has been going on for about a day. This is absolutely unacceptable. 
I will definitely pull out of Bitstamp as soon as it is possible.
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:11:11
Withdrawals are processed manually because the wallet got clogged up from the huge number of addresses and transactions it had on it. I estimate that there is about a 2 week backlog, i.e. transactions initiated 2 weeks ago are being processed now. 
For more info look at this thread:
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:01:59
Indeed silly. Check your transactions when you paid out coins, on blockchain.info. You will notice that your coins went not only to the address where you wanted to send btc but also to some unknown address. This is the change address. It belongs to your own wallet but qt doesn't show it.
