Hi, all.  I purchased BTC through Coinbase prior to Aug 1.  I moved it to a ledger nano s prior to Aug 1.  Everything I read says I should have BCH, but I cannot "find" it.  Can you help?  Thanks!!

Thanks!  That probably makes sense.  I moved my coins to a paper wallet (actually a few) before I got the Ledger.  I'll see if I can figure out how to access them from there.  Happy holidays/season to you and yours.  Appreciate your help!!!!

Thanks, but I need a little more guidance.  Have Googled and followed all the steps recommended, but still no luck.

I thought by moving to my ledger wallet it still 'remained' on Coinbase.  I didn't send to another exchange, just took possession of my private keys

I did.  I've even reset and reinstalled all folders.  I see that I'm at v1.3.1.  I just keep getting told I have 0 BCH on the blockchain.  I'm at a loss - literally and figuratively :)   Thanks for any additional thoughts you might have.

i have a reasonable amount of 4 tokens.  Here are my up to the minute % returns (the only figure that matters).  All were bought over several months since June 2016 using dollar cost averaging:
Eth 120%
BTC 265%
LTC 267%
XRP 279%
Edit - corrected XRP

Thanks. With all due respect to most others, yours seems to be the most logical solution.

Yeah, i've followed all the guides, but still can't see the BCH.  That's why I'm asking for help.

Thanks. I may have misinterpreted your response initially.  I'll look into the ledger solution.

Happy for you, too!  I'm behind BTC as it's the grandfather of crypto, but gotta admit the future is XRP.  Best of luck to you.  Happy holidays.

THANK YOU! Due to your help and keen insight, I was finally able to locate my BCH.  Not enough to retire on, but free is nice.  Thanks again and best of luck to you.  Happy Holidays!
