I just got an email from Gemini saying they are now licensed in Texas. 
 I actually don't know what GDAX is, as I'm currently paying 1% to buy bitcoin on coinbase.

Like kind exchanges are not possible. I've been researching this all year.  Not possible.

No, i'm afraid it's not.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:51:04
For future reference, anytime someone says "fork", in order to be safe you need to store your Bitcoin on your personal wallet that you control the private keys to.  
Various exchanges will hold your Bitcoin and you need to check with the exchange as to what their policy will be.

NYA signaling is at like 93% which is the best estimation we have of how much hashing power will go with Segwit2x
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:37:19
Segwit gives us almost 2x more capacity.  We don't know whether that will be enough.  It's better to wait and see rather than go ahead and do a hard fork.  
Plus, we already have  a process to go through to figure out what improvements we're gonna put into bitcoin and the NYA skips that process.
Plus, if you're going to do a hard fork, it's stupid to go through all the risk for just 1 MB increase.  
Plus, nobody asked us, and we didn't sign the NYA agreement, so we have no actual commitment to the 2x people.  
Plus, increasing the block size will hurt decentralization by some amount.
Plus, there may be a safer way to do a block size increase with a soft fork instead.
Plus, the Segwit2x people are really trying to take over control of development, and we're not gonna go along.  
That's basically the argument.  They're mostly right, but politically their position is untenable, and a compromise is required.  You can't build consensus around a group of people who won't give an inch.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:41:09
This is complete bullshit.  I've been a core supporter from the beginning, but this is just irresponsible.  
There's no reason why we can't go ahead and double the block size right now.  Refusing to go along with the 2X agreement is playing chicken with the network.

Hell if i'm going to trust my fortune to something stored in my head.  Head injuries happen.

Can you link these tests that say that 2mb blocksize will devastate decentralization?
@_date: 2017-08-19 02:01:27
I'm aware of what a hard fork means.  
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:34:07
I've been searching for the last 10 minutes. I can't find anything you're referring to.
What I can find is a bunch of posts with him claiming that we could possibly increase the block size with a soft fork, which definitely is not him arguing against a block size increase at all.  
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:09:43
They make an LLC, put it into an IRA, and then they funnel the contribution through them and send you a check.  What you do after that is up to you.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:05:03
I've heard all this before.  I've used it myself.
Hard forks are only extremely dangerous when it's contentious, and it seems that core is intent on making it contentious.
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:15:17
He's conveniently not mentioning that at the moment, Segwit2x looks like it will have 93% of the hashing power.

You know what, it's not an established protocol if the code lets you do something else.  
That's the whole point of cryptocurrency.  Code is law.  
If Bitcoin relies on "established protocols" - not enforced by code - to exist, then it's a failure.

You really got me with your biting wit.  You've effectively ruined my day. Congrats.
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:19:13
No, i'm sorry, but you're not seeing the bigger picture. 
Like it or not, some people don't agree with your judgement of which scaling solution is technically superior.  
I think the big blockers are idiots, and I'm definitely a fan of Segwit. 
But even if you love Segwit, we still, very soon, are going to have to have enough space to open a bunch of payment channels.  NOBODY believes 1MB will be enough.
So, acknowledging that a hard fork is not optimal, we already have one in the works, and we might as well  put all of our effort behind making sure it's safe and successful rather than having a Civil War right now.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:01:17
I read your link. It is not against raising the block size.  
I'm against larger block sizes than 2mb.  I am not a big blocker, but the idea that 2 MB blocks are going to devastate decentralization is ridiculous.
I remain open to seeing evidence of the contrary.
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:41:18
I agree, but this is a political compromise.  It's not the optimum technical solution.  That's the point.
@_date: 2017-08-19 07:15:50
This is complete mindless nonsense.  
This whole controversy is not about fitting more transactions into a block.  It is about a bunch of people who want to have larger blocks and a bunch of people who want segwit.  
We compromised by giving each side something.  
If we stop at segwit, it's not a compromise.  
Claiming that segwit gives both sides what they want is complete nonsense.

See if you can find an accountant to give you an advisory letter for a 1031 exchange.

@_date: 2017-11-28 21:49:12
But what happens when a tax strategy is completely unprecedented, yet also not clearly illegal...especially in a brand new field with hardly any guidance?
Cryptocurrency is property.  Some property is eligible for a 1031 exchange.  Cryptocurrency is arguably 'like kind', especially things like Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, which are literally the SAME kind.  
So why can't I find a CPA to tell me that I can claim a 1031 exchange on crypto?
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:49:37
Ok, point me to where it says whether I can claim a 1031 exchange or not.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:00:48
This is the standard advice, and is good advice if you don't want to go to jail and don't mind paying the maximum tax rate.
Accountants, especially "good" accountants are experts at reducing risk. Over and over, I have dealt with accountants who refused to do anything that isn't explicitly sanctioned by the IRS, even if you could make a plausible argument that it can be done, which makes it very hard to find an accountant to work on crypto, because there is no guidance from the IRS.
So what they do is they come up with the most conservative strategy possible that forces you to pay the maximum tax, and that way they cover their ass.

If you can point me to one who will be interested, i'm offering a substantial referral reward if I end up engaging.  It has to be someone solid, not Jim Smith from Podunk, AL.  So far zero tax attorneys have been interested.

I can't stand Roger Ver and BCH, but I'm not going to keep standing by while people misrepresent the charges against him.
"Federal criminal" is about as misleading as you can be about what he was charged with. "Selling illegal fireworks on the Internet" is more accurate.

You pay a lawyer to set up an llc, which goes into your Roth IRA.

It's not a complicated answer.  It's an easy answer.  
The government literally doesn't give a fuck what you report as long as you pay all of your taxes.  You could file a tax return claiming that your entire income is gambling winnings, and as long as you pay the taxes you owe,  they don't care. You may get audited, but again, as long as you pay what you owe they can't do anything to you.
There is no crime called lying on your tax return, it is called tax fraud and you only are guilty of tax fraud when you underpay your taxes.
In fact, you could make $100,000 and claim that you made $1 million, and pay $300,000 in taxes, and The. Government. Doesn't. Care.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:02:09
No it's not.  Of course you can pay the highest tax rate and be done with it.  If you get audited, you only get penalties and interest from underpaying your taxes.

You don't need a private bank.  Chase private client will allow you to send and receive hundreds of thousands of dollars a week with only a verification call for each transfer.

It is a rollover. If you're rolling over a Roth to a Roth, there's no tax. If you rollover a 401(k) or a traditional IRA, you are taxed on your gains in the current year.
If you contact them, they are pretty good at walking people through the process.
