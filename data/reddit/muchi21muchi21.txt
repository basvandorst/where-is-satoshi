If I make 511k in cap gains under a year I have to pay close to 50% in tax ([37% + $154k]( ) because its treated as income on the first year. Now tell me do you want to pay 50%? This is theoretical but I understand why most ₿ traders refuse to pay that kind of tax

@_date: 2019-06-02 19:18:09
i think the main reason which he keeps stating that he's the creator is because he wants to get his hands on the 1 mil btc stash that satoshi mined. since he knows he can't he created bsv and started shilling it, once enough shilling happens and the market cap of his bsv reach 1m btc (which it wont) he'll pull the plug and liquedate all of it and then try to reiterate that he is SN. its mainly to fuel his self ego with the cost of betraying his own community. he legit values btc more than anything else so he would do anything of cost to acquire as much as he can.

Something unrelated but somewhat related. Luka_magnotta has been posting YouTube videos last year, he was also a "time traveler" in 2013. [This]( and [This]( I watched "message from the future" it seems like he was trying to stop satoshi himself before ₿ was created

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo

I think if you sell a couch to a stranger he wouldnt have the $100 to buy drugs and kill himself. If you bought the couch from the stranger he would have the $100 to buy drugs and kill himself.

Triangles? Like the shapes? Also I sense annoyance and slight paranoia from you, am I right?
@_date: 2019-09-05 23:39:00
Any suggestions to ask elsewhere?
@_date: 2019-09-19 07:17:43
Also based on your description it indicates that satoshi was never discovered.

Damnit. Well atleast remember me, and try to hook me up with something so I can just "skip" this timeline and jump straight to 2113

Theres probably little chance of recovery even if you knew the password. After that many years data degration takes a toll on the computer

Serious question... how do you know it's from June 2022? And specifically that user? I've been getting a lot of vibe from this community about time travelers and such

I'm expecting a double bottom in price just like 2015, are you?
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:06:38
I know I know, I didnt buy it there ��‍♂️
@_date: 2019-05-10 00:56:03
Yeah be an authoritative entity that completely goes the opposite of the idea of crypto! Even if I dont support roger or Craig, I will go against of stealing their coins because that'll undermine the entire crypto space
@_date: 2019-05-28 19:59:23
But why robinhood?
@_date: 2019-05-31 15:58:54
I respect that opinion. For me it's a hobby
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:52:50

I think a double bottom will occur, granted everytime I say something related to price the exact opposite happens
@_date: 2018-12-26 20:44:32
But the problem is that majority of girls dont know how to use btc, so if you want sex for btc we have to wait for full

@_date: 2019-05-30 04:26:38
I'd say just hold it until btc reaches new ath and during this its dominance goes down due to alts. By that time then I would trade bsv for btc

I wish I had 100k in btc. But the truth is that my life got boring and stagnant so I decided to excite it a little by being in this space. Do I care if btc goes to 0 (nope) will I care if it goes to 1 mil (nope) it's the idea of it that I do care
