I think a lot of you guys are missing the point of why they are taking their money out.  If Greek banks don't get extra funding from a bailout, they won't have enough money for their obligations and operations.  People are taking their money out so it doesn't get swallowed with the banks in case they go bankrupt.  It is not because they are, "storing all [their] money in cash long term."

Yea but that's not too much to a lot of savers.  Also, who knows when they will get it or if it will be in legal proceedings.

Local Bitcoins won't work because most people want Cash for the Bitcoins.  But with Greece closing its banks over the weekend, he has no way to convert his bank holdings into cash to buy bitcoin.  
If he does already have cash (euros), then he should keep them as it is infinitely safer than Bitcoins at the moment, and I'm sure Greeks need all the savings they can get for the unknown immediate future.

I think a lot of people in the bitcoin community are focusing on the wrong things that bitcoin needs to flourish.  I don't own any bitcoins and never had, but I do follow a lot of bitcoin subreddits as I'm interested in it.  The reason I don't own bitcoin is because it is much much harder and more unsafe to buy and sell bitcoins than its alternatives.  Also, the price fluctuates so damn much, it's not the type of currency where I can buy some bitcoins and expect to be able to buy something I want in the future.  The price could change dramatically in a months time.  Bitcoin isn't failing because there's not enough education about it, it's failing because its worse or at most on par with other payment methods out there.  The only pro is anonymity, and even that means little to most people.

QE 2.0 euro edition is too little too late.  Too much spooking the market.  I don't see a big rally happening.

The thing is, Gavin said he believes Craig Wright is Satoshi. That is probably one of the most trustworthy and prestigious bitcoin experts out there.  I think once this happened it was hard for the non-technical people to doubt Craig's claim.

Titles like this is what gives bitcoin a bad name.  Bitcoin has a ton of value in its usefulness, but to suggest it will have more impact than the internet itself is absurd.  The internet has changed the whole world so drastically, there's very little that can compare to it.  
These far out moonshot ideas are what decreases bitcoins reputation, as many people see bitcoin as a fad currency.

Why can't you just use a credit card?  Paypal?  This has relatively little to do with bitcoin besides payment option.

I totally agree with the less overhead part.  The problem with bitcoin right now is it changes price so damn fast.  I would have to buy bitcoin and spend it instantly to know for sure if I would be able to afford the service.  Yes, for the few people who have bitcoin it's not as big as a problem but if I wanted to do micro-transactions a lot to pay for my internet, I would be subjected to a lot of risk if I bought and held bitcoins.  My only other option would be to buy an amount of bitcoin and then immediately pay for the internet service as soon as I got it, which would be a real pain in the ass to do frequently.
