Bitcoin is XXI century gold. Just buy and keep it as asset. You eventually can spend it if needed but treat it like an asset. When it comes to crypto as money I would go with LTC - so cheap and easy to use.

Tell her you own 10 BTC's and see what her reaction will be. If she will support you, or just push you to sell it.

Thanks for that answer interface is really important for me. From what I've seen they upgraded it a bit in new Trezor. Good on you for pre-ordering, hope you will like it!

If it's a win win I guess lower price will take the win. Although I LOVE Trezor T design. Damn, decisions decisions.

When it will hit 100k$ one day (hopefully) ppl will say it will collapse and it's bubble - other side will say it's still on promotion and we should buy and hodl.

Yea I was thinking the same, then just realized how cool it is that affiliate programs exist. Just encourage them to buy some for their selves, even if they are enemies. Two profits, the more of us buy the higher the price is and another as I mentioned you can make a buck from affiliates.
