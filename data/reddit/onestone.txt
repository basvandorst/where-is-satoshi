The domain is registered privately (whois information is hidden behind a proxy). I doubt this is really Josh Jones, more likely a scam.

Apologies in this case.

The XBT/USD volume is indeed pathetic, but XBT/EUR is significant. Which is normal, as Kraken is most useful in Europe.

Yes, the map picture seems outdated. But the actual list below appears correct.

Generating separate keypairs for each process is not a good solution. It's a manual operation, requiring a live person with access to the BitPay account to grant access for each process separately. We live in the PaaS era, when firing new processes is supposed to be a cheap and quick, even automatic operation.
Also, why are monotonic nonces required in order to prevent replay attacks? Isn't it enough that the important operations are idempotent?
(let me know if we should continue this discusion in the GitHub issue instead of here)

 great work. How does your implementation compare to this one:  (except that one is written in Node and the other one in Python)?

There is apparently a proof-of-concept implementation on the authors' website:

Why do you think it's Bulgarian? It's not even translated in Bulgarian.

Do you have any evidence / sources for that? From what I've seen, the owners are completely anonymous, but most likely Russian.

We should integrate bitcoind into systemd!

Look at their XBT/EUR volume.

BitPay, this API is fundamentally broken. I'm talking about the nonce parameter which you require to increase monotonically. That may work well in single-process apps, but not in modern distributed applications. E.g. your own Node.js client fails as it uses the current time to seed the nonce. When starting multiple processes at the same time this often breaks API requests.

Apart from being nice, it makes dates sort lexicographically in the correct order. Which is also... nice. And sometimes useful.
@_date: 2014-09-18 23:19:05
Sorry, but what you describe is not a solution to the problem.
If you start several node-bitpay-client processes at the same time, some of them will usually be unable to even request an access token from the API, because of the increasing nonce requirement.
Regarding your first paragraph - other payment APIs manage to achieve idempotence and replay attack protection without requiring a _monotonically increasing_ nonce.
