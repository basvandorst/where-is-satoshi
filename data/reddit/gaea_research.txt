We have a simple and cost effective replacement for wasteful solar.  It can easily power mining.  Keep an eye out over the next several months.

Until energy becomes free.  A truly clean energy source that is unmetered because it makes electric energy out of nothing.

Still potentially highly toxic and unsustainable.  Harnessing "free" energy is easier than we all might think.

hence the ...almost at the end of the title.  You are right, though, i should have put "utility" before mining costs in the title \- it's what i meant..  The devices can be made to last half a lifetime or longer.  But still, this is a game changer and would remove 99&amp; of electric and fossil fuel bills.

Electricity costs will disappear.  So the only thing we'd all have to pay for is the services for transactions.

I’d say this is for people that would more or less follow what someone like Warren Buffett would say and be a sheep naysayer rather than critically thinking for themselves.  Which is a lot of people.

Well, remember this for the future ;\)
