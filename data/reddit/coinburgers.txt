The first decentralized exchange was Counterparty's, which was live January 2nd of this year. You can access it with [Counterwallet](counterwallet.co).

Yes, but it can't work (Maidsafe). That's his point!

Asset names in Counterparty are transferable just like domain names, so good names will be worth whatever the market decides. Plus, user interfaces usually won't make direct use of the asset names themselves, in favor of more flexible descriptions that Counterparty assets include, like Twitter handles.

They could be bought and sold for *any* asset on the Counterparty exchange, including BTC, XCP and any user created asset.

Not one with automatic order matching, which is more complex, but scales much *better*.

Counterparty was certainly the first live cryptosecurities platform. Of course, I was talking about an existing public company.

The idea behind Colored Coins is very old, and Counterparty for example uses a totally different algorithm which allows for a much larger feature-set than the traditional one, which can only handle the creation of the tokens.

I was discounting TaPoS which is something else entirely. I meant *pure* proof-of-stake.
Of course you also wrote this: "If perfect decentralization is indeed worth $100 billion, then proof of work is definitely the right way to go." I personally think that **freedom is priceless**.

This could be **huge** for Bitcoin (and for [Counterparty]( Imagine, the first-ever issuance of shares of a public company on a cryptosecurities platform! No more pieces of paper representing your shares of stock, just digital assets traded on a decentralized exchange and controlled entirely by *you*.
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:28:05
Presumably the same thing that happens if you lose paper stock certificates.

You don't need XCP, the Counterparty currency, to use the Counterparty decentralized exchange (only the more advanced functionality).
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:02:50
Those are not the only alternatives certainly. In any case, coin-days-destroyed is not pure stake [in the currency].

He's not asking for public controversy, but for community involvement. The concerns of some of the Bitcoin devs are too far removed those of regular users, who need Bitcoin for instance to encourage more innovation at the platform level. If Bitcoin is going to be able compete with future technologies, it'll be because it never let go of its first mover advantage.

No, [Counterparty]( is. Coinffeine (name?!) is 'pre-alpha', while Counterparty and its shiny web wallet [Counterwallet]( have been live and in real-world use for five months and one month respectively.

Asset transfers in Counterparty are just as fast as with colored coins (which has no exchange whatsoever).
@_date: 2014-07-30 22:12:28
XRP is Ripple. Counterparty is XCP, and XCP isn't necessary for any of the basic trading functionality.
@_date: 2014-07-30 18:31:09
People don't lose private keys very often, either.
