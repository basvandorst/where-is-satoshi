@_date: 2017-12-22 13:37:45
That’s because it’s a shit currency. The fundamentals of bitcoin were better when it was at $80 than they are today. It has shown a remarkable ability to get WORSE over time.

Guys, I have a question... what are the advantages of bitcoin compared to cash, a Visa card, banks, etc? What are the advantages to a merchant that wants to accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:25:28
Wouldn’t shock me if it drops to 1-2k
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:27:43
Just dropped to under 12,000. Watching bitcoinity today is nuts.

It isn’t a correction. Bitcoins fundamentals blow right now and it’s clear it’s only use for the foreseeable future is a way for people to scam other people out of money.

I wouldn't bet on that, and while some might see regulation as bad, it could legitimize the currency and bring many more investors/ raise the price. Some aspects may never be regulated, but attacks like the one described above are prime candidates for regulation.

Indeed. Like many have said, its okay to be fine with socialist ideals and still invest in bitcoin. People too idealistically opposed to this are going to scare moderate to liberal people away from the currency.

Not true. If a large number of spenders and sellers do not want a coin with validation, then they will stick with coins that don't have them. It's easy enough to transfer between two coins anyway with the tons of markets out there. Redlist bitcoins? Fine. Buy litecoins, spend the litecoins somewhere, then exchange back to bitcoins.

How would you handle disputes?
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:51:52
I have no idea, it depends on if they label the early day coins as clean or dirty. I wouldn't imagine early day coins would be labeled as dirty though. It would eliminate too many.

The bitcoin never has to be tainted. 
Put it this way: 
1) I buy clean bitcoins from an exchange.
2) I want to send the bitcoins to any particular darknet site or tumbler.
3) To do this, I take my clean bitcoins and exchange them for an altcoin through any online exchange or through any individual on the street. **The bitcoins are still clean.**
4) I send the altcoins to a tumbler, a darknet site, whatever you want to do.
5) I sell the altcoins back for more clean bitcoins, either face to face or on many exchanges that will allow this.
6) I still have clean bitcoins, but I have successfully tumbled them through the use of an altcoin, or successfully spent them in the darknet, etc.

Sounds good to me. There are tons of coins that could operate as a way to tumble your bitcoins or send them places that would mark them as tainted. I think that if this whole "redlisting" thing happens, we're going to see an explosion in altcoins (but not at the expense of bitcoin, hell, bitcoin will probably explode too due to it's view as a "clean" currency and banks will likely buy a ton of them). 
Altcoins themselves are beautiful in that they are a gap in the chain of command when exchanged face to face or through smaller exchanges for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:28:17
Coin tainting is useless.
No bitcoin ever has to be tainted. There is a way around ANY attempt to stop people from sending their bitcoins to tumblers or the darknet.
1) I buy clean bitcoins from an exchange.
2) I want to send the bitcoins to any particular darknet site or tumbler.
3) To do this, I take my clean bitcoins and exchange them for an altcoin through any online exchange or through any individual on the street. The bitcoins are still clean.

But if there are less coins, it means that the individual value of each coin is probably higher than if we assume all coins exist.
@_date: 2013-03-31 07:00:43
Entirely true. I have you know, I am becoming VERY conservative with my speculation. Eventually IMO the bitcent, and mbtc will become the new bitcoin. Bitcoins themselves will be much too valuable for the average person.
There are much more liberal speculators out there with good grasp on the fundamentals that see this going much higher. I am being EXTREMELY conservative when I am basing my speculation on a 5 year value of $1000.
It could very easily be a magnitude higher.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:37:00
Exactly. At least by the time we hit $100, it will be with confident investors.

I bought back in too at 150. I did very well during the crash as well. Saw the 80% jump and sold half that way I could guarantee a profit. I initially bought at 65. I see BTC going back up to 250 again this month, just slower this time.
@_date: 2013-03-26 17:01:41
Yeah, this has been the case for a while. MtGox for instance has to follow anti money laundering laws. If anything, this makes bitcoin more legitimate and might attract more investors.

This is a fantastic idea that would be a really good way to take the BTC and make it accessible to the masses that don't know how to trade in it.
In fact... it would almost force every currency to get pegged to the BTC as the BTC would be the central online currency that could easily be exchanged anywhere.
Very cool.
@_date: 2013-11-16 00:39:36
Ideally, you'd get them at litecoin to bitcoin exchanges that have verified their identities, thus making them whitelisted sources. Alternatively, there is always escrow.
@_date: 2013-03-25 09:19:54
That does make it easier, the fact that it cannot be used online. That also reduces the utility of the card though. Still, I'd absolutely buy one of those cards.
Your biggest problem though will be dispute resolution. Someone buying a faulty product, or getting over-charged (which happens fairly often at brick-and-mortar shops).

Interesting things from the document so far:
- Cryptography was really good, and the complaint states that the TOR network makes it "practically impossible" to trace users.
- The tumbler worked. It "frustrates attempts to track transactions back to the blockchain and makes it practically impossible to trace users."
- There were 9 MILLION bitcoins worth of transactions that passed through the system over time.
- The server was in a foreign country. The report does not say where.
- There were 957k registered silkroad accounts.
- 146k unique buyer accounts.
- It's unstated from when the investigation started, but they received a complete copy of the Silk Road web server on the 23rd of July 2013. This was all done under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, which implies that they had access to current site information up until the point they shut the site down.
- This included user account and transaction information. It's unclear whether or not this covers addresses and other sensitive transaction information.
**This also apparently covers at least 60 days worth of messages from the period where the site was copied. It seems from the information, PGP messages were probably ok given that the document said PGP makes it practically impossible to trace the users.
- Silkroad maintained a small staff of admins, it wasn't just DPR.
- It is not certain that PGP worked for DPR, they have messages between the staff and DPR from "forensic analysis of the server." Unless he was not using PGP.
- DPR solicited murder for hire. Someone was able to obtain thousands of usernames, passwords, and personal info of silkroad users. It is assumed the feds have this, because they speak about the sample messages of names that the hacker sent. As a result, DPR attempted to have him killed. It is not known if the guy ever was indeed killed.
- The silk road was basically made from the shroomery.com, it was the first place he visited. They traced him by finding his old posts on various forums where he advertised it, not as the owner, just saying "I found this site, what do you think about it?"
- They caught Ross Ulbricht through simple web sleuthing and a few subpoenas.
- He did his web administrating from an internet cafe on Laguna Street in San Fransisco.
- Canada intercepted fake ID's going to his home. This was used to match with fake ID requests.
- For all the money he made, he lived in a small apartment with room mates for under 1000 a month.
- Here is the blockchain transaction for the "hit": 
- youtube URL: 
- Interview between him and a friend: 
- The site where he made his first mistake and gave out his email address in PMs with his name. 
Amazing stuff.

I've been searching for a hole in my argument myself. In fact, if anything, this proves that it is impossible to truly come up with a "tainted coin" system because of the plethora of other altcoins out there you can use to keep your anonymity.
Of course, my article will be downvoted to hell because it mentions altcoins... but damn, altcoins are really going to save bitcoin if this comes into effect and makes the whole threat entirely moot.

I did well.
I started with 12 bitcoins at 60.
I sold 2.5 at 240, recooping my initial investment.
I sold 4 during the crash at 120.
That leaves me now with $1080 and 5.5 bitcoins left, from an initial investment of $720. If bitcoin crashes down to 10-20, I will rebuy in several. I may rebuy if bitcoin stays stable at 60-70 for a while. If bitcoin goes up, I'm still invested in it. I can't really lose.

@_date: 2013-11-15 17:48:41
Exactly. The altcoin itself isn't required to be spendable, it's just a way of escaping a cryptocurrency that adopts a regulation scheme for use in ways not approved by that regulation scheme and being able to convert back into that cryptocurrency with ease. We FINALLY see what the actual value and use of altcoins are.
@_date: 2013-03-30 01:09:57
