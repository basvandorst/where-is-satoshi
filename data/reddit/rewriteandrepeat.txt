I would say it took so long because the 2013 run to 1200 was mostly fradulent and therefor it took a lot of time to regain trust and find "real" price
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:50:00
I dont think it is that easy today especially with bitcoin's market capitalisation but four years ago it was completely different and anyone with lot of money or influence could have move market very easily.

mine is basically, if you want to be in next block.... 120-140 should be ok for 4-6 blocks
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:16:49
Im not referring to that paper. The raise itself was fradulent and it was known and referred to during past years many times. With mtgox creating the market combined with chinese fomo the raise was completely made up and the subsequent "bear market" wouldnt be bear market at all if the fake ath wouldnt loom over it. If you move the 2013 fake top to 2015 on log graph, the 2 year cycles 2011-2013-2015-2017 look completely identical.

Point is you can set it up any way you want, if i would be him i would set up 2 exchanges, send to each 150K, withdraw and then waited until it appears in fiat on my account. Then repeat two times. Yes, he will pay more fees and he risks the market will move against him while he is waiting for the fiat transfer but its much safer. 
But now i realize we dont know op anyway and we dont know if he is trying to cash everything out, he could be doing it the way i described and the 1.8M is just small amount of his worth :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:56:08

My suggestion is you do yet another website and keep this one for fun(this one is cool but there will be obviously lot of liers, victims of scammers and would haves should haves so it wont be very precise.
If you wanna do really useful service then do another similar website and  when entering data user has to put a public adress of the lost funds so its verified. Your website can then track the adresses and if there is any movement of the coins then you can remove the entry

@_date: 2017-12-01 13:02:52
its actually quite a lot. Last time i checked some months ago the fees were almost 10 perc of block reward. Which when you think about it(if everything stays constant which it wont) means that in just 3 reward halving(10 years) the fee reward will be almost same as block reward and from then it will only continue to rise.

if you ve been in game for years you would know we have seen this type of crash many many times and even worse... we had same crashes when fees were low and transaction time were regular. It has (almost)nothing to do with it. What it has to do with it is that bitcoin price increased 100 times more from the lowest point of last bear market and we cannot go up infinitely without people taking profits.

dont push her to put all in, that would be just gambling. Its her money after all. If you explain her carefully everything and tell her she would be investing into an incredibly volatile asset that could on one hand potentionally turn into amazing returns, while explaining her on the other hand at least 5 times that she could lose everything and she will be absolutely ok with it(with losing all) then why not. Being in your situation with this amount i wouldnt invest more than like 5-10k.

No, you own both BTC and BCH now. Move the funds from your current paper wallet to a new paper wallet on bitcoin blockchain and secure it as you had before. After this step use the private keys of original paper wallet on bitcoin-cash blockchain and transfer the funds to whatever bitcoin cash exchange you wish and sell them(or keep them, if you want)
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:11:25
Nobody will guarantee you anything, bitcoin is not here to make you rich. Following the ATH in 2013, we entered a bear market for 2 years and we saw the price being reduced 6 times. Are you ready the price could go from 4000 to sub 1000? If not and you are here just because you saw the price has risen rapidly and you pray it can go forever up because you heard people shouting 50k 100k 500k left and right, then putting money in bitcoin might not be for you.
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:00:45

Ask yourself a question. Why you wanna buy for those 100 pounds? If not for spending on products or services and just for hodling as investment then ask again,  if you buy today and tomorrow we drop 50% will you chicken out and sell or will you overcome the pussy in you and hold for many years to come? If the first then it might not be for you, if the latter then buy and welcome to the club.

@_date: 2017-08-21 07:36:50
Im talking about ATH end of 2013 hitting 1100-1200ish and next 2 years when we went sub 200. I dont want to speak condescending to you, just trying to keep the gold rush mood little in line. About the price dropping, people here will tell you to buy the dips and it is a good strategy, or simply just hold. What I personally(as hodler) do, when the price is dropping,  is to set up SMS price alert for higher price(at bitstamp) and i ignore then the price for weeks or months completely and then when we bounce i receive SMS one day which will make your day much brighter. It really is unhealthy for you to be stressed about the price, if you are here in as investor for longerm.

Im not saying it will happen, i cant predict future. 
But if someone is investing such amount and probably thinking he will make amazing returns automatically, he must also have in mind opposite negative scenario and for this scenario he must already prepare in advance and know what will he do(what will he do then, hold for months, years before we pass his entry point again or panic sell for loss?

With each block mined, fees are paid aswell. Right now, when we are not in crazy bull run and fees are normal fees vary around 0,6-1 btc per block.  Now look at the block rewards in upcoming years -  2020-2024 6.25 btc, 2024-2028 3.125 btc, 2028-2032 1,5625 btc 2032-2036 0,78 btc ...... do you see? in 2028 fees will be very close to the block reward and in 2032 fees will be most likely more than block reward on average.
When all bitcoins are mined this will be no issues because block reward will be miniscule in compare to fees so incentive for mining will allways be there, they will just receive fees reward instead of block reward

he wont regret if he times it correctly, but based on his post, he has no experience and in my experience let me tell you people like that will never buy when it drops... they will be too scared / waiting to buy even lower and when they realize market turned again they will be above price they initially sold
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:11:11
Trezor is a safe options to store coins, not a way of exchange. If you want to minimize risk when selling coins for fiat money, you wont send all coins to exchange at once, but just partially and you will wait till you have fiat money on your account by each sale (That way you minimize risk of exchange going down with all your money)

I applaud you, it takes much bigger balls to buy in drop and retracting market, than to make buy after extreme long run like the 4000-5000 "hero" buyers who will now panic sell and cry how useless and unfair bitcoin is.
Just be ready we could go much lowe,r but if you keep dollar cost averaging like you plan with the 25-50 every week you will also bring down the point of profit for you and when the market turns you wont regret.

Bitcoin is still in its infancy... and already today miners get quite huge revenue from fees.... right now if i look at past few blocks for the mining reward of 12,5 they get around 1,3-1,8 BTC from fees which is 10-15 percent. And thats now... now look at halving, 2020 miners get 6,25 BTC reward, 2024 3,125 BTC.....2028 1,5625 ..... so in just 10 years the miners reward will be same as fee reward (if everything else stays constant which most definetely wont)

@_date: 2017-10-19 14:57:16
Im not sure if im correct but it seems to me that they charged you obscene amount of money for withdraw and then used bitcoin network to send the transfer with almost lowest fee possible.
Thats preposterous.
(but again i never used gdax so i can be wrong) But the transaction id doesnt lie and that transfer of yours was casted with that 4,8 sat/byte fee.

- because unlike any other electronic data(not item), you cant copy it
- you can transfer it within minutes anywhere in the world
- you can "carry it" with you as 12 words in your head across most secured borders and nobody will know you have it
- with its deflationary nature, longterm you most likely wont lose its value unlike fiat money
- and no, you dont have to buy full bitcoin for 5 grand, you can buy any value you want, be it 5 bucks or million
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:47:32
I dont know which 600 entry point you are refering to because there were multiple 600s since the big rush in 2013 but lets say you started putting those ten bucks weekly to btc last year in June when the bitcoin price finally climbed again over 600.
So starting point is June 11 2016. With 10 dollars weekly till now you would have invested total of 710 USD which translates to roughly 0.7 BTC over that time period. Which means your holding would be now worth almost 4000 USD and you would have made around 3300 USD profit.
I did the math
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:41:05
volume per day is how much?close to 4 billions no? so 9 millions(0,25pct) "inflation" is not that dramatic

Trading cannot be done risk-free. Either you will just trade some minimum amounts and keep your main stash in Trezor(or other hw wallet) but if you are good at it, you wont make much profit, since you trade only small part of your coins..... Or you will keep maximum or everything at exchange so you are flexible in trading, but you are in every moment risking all your assets, if that exchange would go down.
It is also possible you keep coins at HW wallet and send them to sell at exchange by each trade and send coins back to HW wallet after buying again but you will not be flexible and you will be exposed aswell as you will have to keep that fiat you just got at exchange(or you could withdraw that fiat to your bank, but that would be just stupid by for the enormous fees involved and everything would take some time).
So its just matter of how much are you willing to risk, if you really wanna do trading.

@_date: 2017-07-28 08:07:11
I would say it isnt completely unrealistic. More people hear about split and to not keep their coins on exchange = moving coins off exchange = less supply. More people hear about possibility of having BTC and BCC coins after split means more demand before 1st August = trying to buy at any cost and again moving the coins away after purchase will lead again to less supply which will lead to price increase.
