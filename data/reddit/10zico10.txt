Good to know. Thanks. I am just saying that classical liberal-democratic (as oposed to social-democratic) politicians would coalesce around Bolsonaro if he wanted to liberalize the economy as Paulo Guedes would most definitely and eagerly wish. By joining forces, Partido Novo and/or Amoedo could say that besides all that, they would also wish that cryptos were treated in a certain (positive) way.

If Paulo Guedes can lead the economic agenda, and that may depend on likely support, do you not think Amoedo and his party would become immediate allies of Bolsonaro and have a say on policy?
Alckmin?! This is the worst people in Brazilian politics, pretending they are for markets and eternizing the left in power, dispite dismal economic performance and huge increase in taxes and debt.

Pompliano is a really nice guy, but he only offered some trends and said that _if they continue_... Problem with this is that if cars driving toward intersections continue their trend, there will be hundreds of thousands of car accidents in the next few seconds. Oops, but maybe if you look at another trend, then this will not happen, and we'll have only about the average number. So we need a theory to go along with trend identification and selection. He offered nothing of the kind. Even if he has a theory -- he mentions a model -- he did not specify his assumptions, other than that he is looking for trends.  This I say is worthless by itself. Especially in crypto.

I thought they wanted to get rid of the competition.
But your take is nice too.

Yes, plenty of "baptists" out there. But plenty of bootleggers as well. Regulation is, most often, imho, a major scam. It doesn't even try to protect the public. Sad how it is used to, supposedly, help avoid people being scammed.

Zero chance of winning, but likely to partner with leading candidate (center-right coalition), so this is excellent news. Also, Paulo Guedes, likely Finance Minister, is a brilliant free-market economist.

Bond maket is down. Hence, interest rates are up. Stock market could dive. All eyes on this.

They are swimming in yen. Quantitative easing started decades ago. The banking system has no idea what is to come of this. In case the yen colapses, the govt wants people to have some bitcoin. Guess what would happen to btc's price if the yen started to go down severely in value. There you have a scenario that could make us rich, sad as it is to the Japanese. And this is what would save us too, because the rest of the world isn't imune to such a danger, even if debt more than twice the gdp and negative interest rates make the Japanes situation worth the decision to render btc legal tender to that othewise extremely conservative people.

Peter Schiff said something similar. A client said he had done something like that for some investment (not sure if crypto), and Schiff said he was right, indeed that could be done. Apparently Schiff hadn't thought about it himself, but concluded he was absolutely right.

- Seems like a bubble. Bring the canon.

As long as I don't mislead anyone, I'm ok with it. I wasn't able to know if there was something to  this relationship.  Hopefully reaching a more definite opinion didn't consume too much of your resources.

Saw him saying he knew the price wd skyrocket because it is necessary for the last units to be mined. Call me nuts, but he assumed what he wanted to prove. Who said it would be mined/worth mining to that point?
If I follow what he writes, I can find flawed reasoning regularly. Not bragging. Just warning.

From what I know about the country's president, he is a free-market, pro-liberty guy.
