But the altcoin prices generally follow the ups and downs of Bitcoin, and they are generally only tradeable for Bitcoin, not for fiat. Exchanging one form of cryptocurrency for another is not a taxable event because the altcoin exchange rates are so closely aligned with Bitcoin. Take Litecoin as an example: say you purchase one bitcoin for $100 and then later trade it for five litecoins when the current market price of bitcoin has risen to $300. If the BTC/LTC exchange rate has remained the same during that whole time period, and you never exchange the bitcoin back into fiat, then you have not experienced a realizable gain because your bitcoin is still worth the same amount of litecoins (five) irregardless of the increase in bitcoin's value compared to the dollar.

You make some wrong assumptions here that are potentially quite damaging to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Why should converting from one cryptocurrency to another be subject to taxes? Converting between Bitcoin and, say, Litecoin or Dogecoin is similar to converting between a hundred dollar bill and some ten dollar bills or lots of pennies. It's just different denominations of cryptocurrency. No fiat is involved, and in many cases no market price even exists for converting cryptocurrency into fiat. Most cryptocurrency is denominated in Bitcoin, as it's just converting one form of cryptocurrency for another, similar to trading a dollar for quarters. Trading between different denominations of cryptocurrency does not constitute realized gain or loss. Please update your site accordingly. Thanks!
