Definitely agree.  I think the only reason people hate on hosted wallets is because it's a centralized way for a website to steal a shitload of BTC in fell swoop.  We have plenty of examples in recent history.
They also can be "touched" by oversight, regulation and destroy anonymity.  Maybe once something decentralized exists, people will see hosted stuff as a nice luxury.

Nah, his plate is "THX4BTC".

Congrats and welcome.  Have you seen this? 
This video is the reason I got into cryptocurrency.

Sure, absolutely.  It just won't be in the traditional banking sense since your money won't be available if the "bank" loans it out (unless they have their own Bitcoin to pay you, which if that's the case, they won't need your Bitcoin).  Like coastermonger said above, you either have a debt based economy or you don't.
Perhaps we can have a hybrid but at least with that you will know that once you give your money to a bank, you may not get it back for a long time.  All the minor details can be worked out, I'm sure.

Buy and sell them at coinbase.com and find out where to use them at coinmap.org
Welcome to the world of Bitcoin :-)

Haha, please, most pigs don't even understand how to install an app.

I think you guys are arguing the difference between "doing business with" and "banking through".
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:35:30
You are leaving out the most important stuff.  You are forgetting the power behind having control of the monetary supply.  Watch this and you'll see what I'm talking about:

It's a beaut!

I use Coinbase but I am growing very weary of their attempts to "play ball" with the banksters.  I will absolutely reserve judgement but I am definitely concerned where this is going.

Sorry, I forgot to emphasize that the whole company is a work in progress (like Bitcoin), including the website.  If you click the kinetics.cc image or the first hexagon link, you get taken to store.kinetics.cc which has much more detail about everything.
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:33:08
This is all you need to know, all the reason.  This is why I am here. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:27:25
You ever use coinmap.org?
@_date: 2015-01-19 16:05:44
Amen to this!  Check out kinetics.cc.  Those guys pretty much outline the splendor that will be brought forth by blockchain technology.  Last I heard, Morgan was trying to start an entire town that uses Bitcoin (or another blockchain currency) for all transactions.  Everything from laundromats to gas pumps.
Completely automated, secure and middle-man free!  Used like cash without the theft of wealth associated with fiat.  Beautiful.

Too messy man.  Think of BTC as gold.  No one loans gold or collects interest on gold because it needs to be there, at all times (technically).  If it is not there, then it is consumed or sold off and you no longer have it.

But that means BluetoothCoin... :-P

In Musk we trust!  He officially won my respect when he basically came out and called any car company that has "service revenue" as part of their income stream scam artists.
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:52:20
Exactly, any attempt to "regulate", see "fuck up", the blockchain will defeat the entire point of such a system.
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:03:32
Awesome stuff and great ideas.  Our group is working on a decentralized marketplace along with other decentralized features.  As the pressure from the state and censorship grows, decentralization will soon be all we have.

Regulations have never lead to greater prosperity or a freer market. Regulations are used to create a barrier to entry for small players and startups. Be careful what you ask the government for.

As a bitcoin holder, I'll take that one time gain! :-D
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:50:18
I agree in the long long long term but for a while, they won't perish as since the government is around to support them.
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:44:13
The only reason they don't "want" bitcoin is because they have to buy it legitimately and will pay through the nose. This "detriment" is exactly why I love bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:41:24
Haha, exactly what I thought.
