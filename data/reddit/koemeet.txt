Transactions are confirmed by miners. Miners are using computational power, which they get crypto currency for in return. Last days we saw a market manipulation by billionares to "hype" Bitcoin-Cash, which caused it to increase almost 1000%. Due to this, all miners switched to Bitcoin-Cash and Bitcoin network lost a lot of computational power and so transactions could not be confirmed quickly anymore. Since it was just a market manipulation, Bitcoin-Cash crashed shortly after and all miners switched back to Bitcoin since it is way more profitable to mine. I believe around 95% of the miners are on Bitcoin now, so it is rapidly going back to normal. 
Still the issue persists. Since it is true Bitcoin has a scaling issue right now. But if you follow the development going on, you will see there are brilliant things coming our way.

this noob, hahahahah..

Research some more, you will notice there is so much development going into BTC which don't do short-term easy solution to fix the current scaling "issue". But instead, they work on real solutions which would also support world wide adoption of BTC. Follow the development going into both parties to clear things up for yourself. BCH cannot take over BTC, it is just manipulated to make even more BTC.

If BTC may cause to drop to +- $5k, nice time to buy even more ;) The trick is to use the fear that people without a good understanding have.

They hype an alt-coin like Bitcoin-Cash to the extend that it is worth 5-10x more and then instantly sell it on the high. This money doesn't come out of nothing and is from the people who think Bitcoin-Cash is a good idea. Combined with all the fake news and weird shit going on, you could call Bitcoin-Cash in a way a scam.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:38:18
105k pending. not 180k. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 03:48:17
It needs time for people to realise how much better BTC is and how simplistic the IQ is of the people behind BCash.

This has to be the worst wannabe developer I have ever seen in my life..

Very good! I may do the same as well, the contribution of 1 may seem small, but I feel like helping too. I believe in the future almost every household runs its own node for the added benefits listed in the video you linked. Fuck it, I will just setup one right now too at AWS :)
