We have tightened up controls around withdrawals in light of recent account compromises and the announcement today of another major exchange hack.  The upside is that if your account credentials are compromised, you hopefully have a larger window of time to catch it.  The down side is that our system isn't perfect and some withdrawals will be flagged that shouldn't be, which will cause some unnecessary delay. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 08:55:05
Kraken hasn't been hacked -- unless you know something I don't.
@_date: 2016-08-08 20:39:21
There was another email ( that went out to the many accounts which were successfully logged in to.  I can only go off of what clients have reported to us through our support channels but my understanding is that:
1. none had 2 factor (among the successful logins)
2. most included bitfinex among other possibilities
3. a few said that bitfinex was the only possibility
4. a few said that they had extremely strong passwords
The timeline fits with my own speculation about what probably happened:  someone compromised a series of machines, maybe not all at the same time, or maybe at the same time but they had to wait for all the necessary keys to be entered and captured to pull off the heist.  Could be the hackers were also able to intercept client passwords as they logged in during the time the hackers had access to the machines.  I would be curious to hear from the people that received any related email from Kraken whether they had recently logged in to Bitfinex.  It might help us pinpoint the earliest date of compromise, if the events are related.
To be clear, I don't have hard evidence that the events were related but there does seem to be a very strong correlation.

Without going in to the details of your account in public, here are some reasons why an account might be locked:
1. belief that the account is compromised
2. banking/payment partner demand on the basis of:
 - chargeback/return request
 - strongly suspected/confirmed fake identity
 - strongly suspected/confirmed fraud
 - strongly suspected/confirmed money laundering
 - strongly suspected/confirmed other criminal activity
 - law enforcement demand
3. our own, direct experience with the list from 
4. strong/confirmed connection to other flagged/locked accounts
Unless the funds on your account are involved in an active criminal investigation against you, and law enforcement with appropriate jurisdiction and authority (which we very carefully vet to avoid Shaun Bridges/Carl Mark Force scenarios) seize your funds, the funds will be returned to you.
I apologize for not being able to discuss your account further.  For the record, your post on r/Kraken wasn't removed.  The sub requires all posts to be reviewed before they're published.

We do not comply with all LE requests.  Requests related to taking any action on a client's account or producing information related to a client's account must come in the form of a subpoena.
There is a cost associated with processing any LE request.  Kraken is not reimbursed for any expenses incurred as a result of a LE request.  We certainly would not want to make a reputation for ourselves among the LE community that we will do whatever is asked, without following proper protocol.  On top of that, we take the rights and privacy of our clients very seriously.
When we receive what looks like a legitimate, qualified, properly submitted LE request, we will perform our own diligence on the request and requester.  This diligence consists of attempting to independently verify the identity and contact information of the requester, the authority of the requester, and the legitimacy of the request.  If it all checks out, we will comply.

0.6 bitcoin for $480 means that you will buy 0.6 bitcoin for (0.6*480) $288.  As others have mentioned, price varies by market and your _local_ bitcoins market could differ greatly from the more liquid, global exchanges.  A 5% markup ($465-&gt;$480) really isn't that bad.

@_date: 2016-04-16 19:57:01
Yeah, I understand the concern.  Even if you suspect someone is murderer, it doesn't make it ok to steal their wallet.  The guy might be innocent and you might find yourself in jail for theft.  If we think a user is too sketchy to service, we will shut down the account and ask the user to withdraw their funds.
@_date: 2016-04-01 11:35:00
We are not in the business of closing accounts.  It's our preference that every account remain active and generating fees.  Having to lock, investigate and close accounts is a hassle for us and a bad experience for the client.  We don't do it without good reason.  If a mistake was made, and the client is cooperative, the matter will be resolved quickly.
@_date: 2016-04-01 10:23:13
I can't get in to what OP's account is like but it's way under 1% of accounts that ever get locked, and if you are not involved with any of those potential causes I listed, the chances that your account will be locked are near-0.
@_date: 2016-04-16 18:50:21
hm.  should have been.  let me check for you.
@_date: 2016-04-16 19:04:24
Situations in which funds could become locked:
1.  Banking/payment partner demand
2.  Law enforcement demand
3.  Our own determination that the funds are theft-sourced
In no circumstance do we ever confiscate the funds for ourselves.  It's possible that your funds could be confiscated by your government.  A banking/payments partner might hold your funds until they can determine that the deposits aren't fraudulent.  If we hold your funds because they've clearly been stolen from another person, those funds will be returned to the other person.
If we lock your account due to the suspicion of criminal activity and we don't have a demand from anyone to hold it, you'll be allowed to withdraw it.
@_date: 2016-04-16 19:53:12
One example would be another trusted exchange telling us that their hot wallet was hacked and being able to clearly follow the coins through the blockchain to a specific Kraken account.
Usually, we wouldn't do it without receiving a complaint.  We might do it in the case where we have not yet received a complaint but a theft has been announced and we're able to track it.

You might check on your payment-pending emails once a week just to make sure nothing like that slipped through the cracks, or give the important people your phone number, or, as you suggest, an alternate email account.  Personally, I get about 99 unwanted "opportunities" for every real one, and I'm willing to take the chance, being in the industry I'm in, that if the person really wants to get a hold of me, they will find some bitcoin, or find another way.

Let's evaluate the options here:
Gox pays the $7/domain for its typos
* or Scammer
* or Competitor
* or Gox hater
* or Affiliate/marketer
* or Domain flipper
* or Magical guardian angel
For 2 years, I was the magical guardian angel.  Now I'm a competitor, if you even count Gox in the same league as Kraken.  I don't, which is why I'd happily sell Mark back those domains he was careless enough not to buy for himself.  I'd gladly be the Domain flipper.  He should have bought them to protect his users from the Scammer, but he didn't and now he suffers the Competitor, which I say is getting off easy.  That's business.
And yes, it is a legitimate tactic, and it's an easily preventable problem.  If $7/domain is too much for you to pay to protect your customers and your business up front, you can always try to work out a deal later.  Not that Mark has asked, but if he doesn't like it, I think my price is extremely fair.
@_date: 2014-02-27 09:09:11
At this point it seems unlikely that they're lying about the lost coins just to create an opportunity to buy more cheap.  I agree that they may have been trying to suppress the price in order to create an arbitrage or buying opportunity for themselves in order to keep the ship afloat.
@_date: 2014-02-27 11:12:29
We didn't think they were insolvent back in 2011.  The story was that Gox lost 4000 BTC in that hack, which was easily covered by Gox/Mark's own reserves.  You're right though, in hindsight, we may have been helping to save what ultimately turned out to be a giant ponzi.
@_date: 2014-07-17 03:14:03


Sure, but if the source bank suddenly has a giant spike in fraudulent transactions to a particular destination bank, it might just be easier for them to stop allowing transfers to that bank.  You can imagine that a bank which cannot receive transfers from other banks would be lot less valuable to clients, which presents a business problem for the bank.  The easiest way for the destination bank to solve that business problem would probably be to shut off the problematic recipient account, which would be our account.
Since we don't want to lose our bank account, we need to keep our bank happy, which means we need to help our bank keep other banks happy, which means we need to prevent fraud, even if we're not directly being held responsible for the fraud.

Actually, Bitcoin.de has exclusivity for agency with Fidor for Germany but that doesn't mean that our service necessitates any sort of license or agency agreement in the Germany or the EU at all.

See my comment above, but I've had those domains for over 2.5 years and not once have I been asked for them.  They were acquired before Kraken was even an idea, and they were acquired to protect mtgox users, at my own expense.  Now, I could either release them for some scammer to pick up, or use them for my business and make back some of they money I've put in.  If Mark wants them, they're for sale.
@_date: 2014-01-02 18:26:38
There is no common, widespread problem.  The problems are with a few users and they seem to be specific to their transfers, their banks, the routes the transfers have taken, the way the bank sent the transfers, etc.  Creating concern with a general announcement to tens of thousands of people for a problem that exists among tens of people at most, I don't think is justified.  I agree though that we can make it more clear on the deposit page that the user should consult their sending bank to confirm the method by which the payment has been sent.
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:22:39

Kraken never charges a fee on its end to receive a SEPA transfer.  We credit 100% of the amount we receive.  If we've received less than you sent, you'll have to contact your bank and determine how they sent it and who the intermediaries might be, and what cut those hops along the way might have taken.
@_date: 2014-03-03 13:54:01
Nice to meet you too!
Yes, the accounts with Fidor Bank are held in the name of Payward (Kraken), and the account that holds the user's funds is specifically designated as a Customer FBO (for benefit of) account.  Those funds are protected both from Kraken and from Kraken's creditors in the event of a business failure.  The customer funds are not split out in to individual sub accounts for each person.  As far as I'm aware, that is not a legal requirement.
Sure, registration with FinCEN in the US doesn't give you some sort of international license to do whatever you want, but it doesn't imply that a license is actually needed abroad either.  Doesn't allow != prohibits.  Generally, the law applies wherever the customer resides.  If you have a customer in California, you would need to follow the law of California with regard to servicing that customer, and likewise if you have a customer in Germany, you'd need to follow the law that applies in Germany.  Not all countries in the world have a licensing requirement to provide the service of a bitcoin exchange to their residents.
We have two full-time lawyers working within the company, and a handful of external counsel, and legal bills beyond $1m.  I'm inclined to trust our own very thorough and conservative analysis, and the clearance letters we have from several EU member states specific to our service.  I take it your own professional legal analysis is that we actually need a license of some sort to be servicing EU customers, and absent our own license, or either way, it is a legal requirement to name Fidor Bank in our ToS.
IANAL so forgive me if I sound ignorant.  Would you mind pointing out to me the specific statute in EU law or with any particular EU member state that you feel our service is violating?  We can go back and forth claiming that Kraken is or isn't following the law but it might be helpful to know which law(s) specifically we're talking about.  Since you've asserted the positive claim that we're breaking some law, I'd appreciate it if you could impart some wisdom and help me either clear up the confusion or suspend our service where we're in violation.
@_date: 2014-01-01 23:53:58
dick move for doing what, exactly?  Redirecting them to Kraken after sitting on them for 2 years, protecting Gox's userbase at my own expense?  There are three options:
Use them, try to get something out of them.
Don't use them but keep paying for them anyway.
Let them go, let another competitor, scammer, opportunist have them.
I think it's the only rational move.

The thought had crossed my mind.. a few problems with it:
1.  I'd wager most of Gox's customers are in the United States, a jurisdiction we largely cannot service legally (for fiat trading).
2.  Now that Gox is offline, we have no way of verifying actually who had an account or lost anything.
3.  Offering a great service ain't free.  Kraken is already cheap, and I think people are already getting a great deal.
Maybe we could just do free trades for everyone for a month.  Thanks for the suggestion!

Jesse from Kraken here.
How could Davout possibly have information about funds commingling?  How could he claim that we have zero financial compliance?  Does he have moles inside both Kraken and our banks, inspecting the books and reporting back?  I say Davout's panties may be a little too tight and they're cutting off blood circulation to his brain.  You wouldn't want someone with brain damage running your exchange, would you?  I demand Davout prove his panties are adequately loose!  Failure to immediately provide notarized photographic evidence will result in assumption of moose knuckle.
The truth is Kraken is [registered properly]( and we're very careful not to take on customers in jurisdictions where we don't have the requisite licenses/clearance.  We're not even taking customers in 90% of the US, which puts us at a huge competitive disadvantage.  In Europe, we're [operating under Fidor Bank's EU banking license](  We have strict controls on account segregation, movement of funds and KYC/AML procedures.  Have you seen any other exchange with deposit limits?  We go above and beyond to be legally compliant.
No customer funds are ever commingled with the company's own funds. We let fees accumulate in the customer account and regularly pull fees over to the operations account. This is the only time funds would move in that direction. The only time funds would move in the other direction would be if we somehow screwed up or wanted to pay users for something, like a referral credit.  This accounting system is used for cryptocurrencies as well.  We have segregated funds for customer bitcoin and our own.
We'll be providing the results of our audit to the community later in the week.
I gave another response a few days ago here:  
All in good fun,

Yes, it is very much a risk.  Fidor are the ballsiest guys in banking.  So far, I think supporting Bitcoin is a net positive for them but if several major banks ganged up to blacklist Fidor together, it could be a different story.  This is why, despite all the trouble Bitcoin companies have in getting banked, you haven't seen any just buy a bank.  Your banking network might shut you out or your regulator might yank your license.  Having a bank is no guarantee you'll be able to function.  Cryptocurrency Bank will help more companies and individuals in the space get banked but it does create a rich target for the haters.  Banks and regulators both seem to be warming up and getting more comfortable with the space, the risks and the technology so I don't foresee it being a problem.

Verification with Kraken may not be necessary but some level of "verification" may be required as part of the claims filing process.
We are strongly encouraging the trustee to approve payouts in BTC.  A much less desirable alternative, if that is not possible, would be to fund your Kraken account with your payout and allow you to buy BTC.
There is also a chance that Kraken will find a US domestic banking partner to facilitate payouts in the US by the time USD payouts would be made.

I registered them in June of 2011, from the Mt. Gox office in order to protect Gox from additional security threats. When I had lunch with Mark last month, he asked for the domains and I told him I'd transfer them to him as soon as he provided me his registration information. Before he got around to it, everything blew up.  I only redirected them recently and if it saved anyone from setting up accounts at Gox, I'm glad I did.
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:46:01

Thanks for the awesome post, Jason.  Lots of really touching comments in this thread.  I love the Bitcoin community.
As others have said, running a Bitcoin startup is just about the most insane thing anyone could do.  You're trying to change the world, you've got a lot of forces against you, and a lot of things outside of your control.
I build downtime in to my schedule, as if it's work that absolutely must get done--basic personal maintenance like going to they gym, sleeping 8 hours a night.  Worst thing you can do is let yourself go, burn out, get sick and have everything you worked so hard for unravel because you didn't take care of yourself.
When things are super stressful, I draw on motivation from the tremendous good we're helping to bring upon the world.  And, I always remember that if at any point I'm feeling defeated, or that I can't take it anymore, I've got options.  Chances are, if you're an entrepreneur, you'd be good at something else.  Personally, I think it'd be a lot of fun to be a teacher, and I'd bet there's at least one school out there in the world that would take me.  If not, I'll just start my own.. in a country where education is not regulated :P
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:45:29
Thanks, mate.  It seems pretty certain at this point that Gox doesn't have the coins--we're just not sure why.  Could be theft, could be lost access to cold wallet, could be anything.

Great step forward but nothing new for the industry.  Kraken has had timelock on account functions, including withdraw, since day 1.  There's also a way to emergency unfreeze the functions as well.  I agree with though--you don't own the coins unless you alone own the private keys.
@_date: 2014-01-02 07:15:16
The legacy banking system is far from perfect.  We're aware that some users have experienced some difficulty and we are working as fast as we can to sort out the issues.  Unfortunately, with all the holidays lately, it's been slow going.  Kraken operates 24/7/365 but our banking partners do not.  I'm looking forward to the day when you won't want to withdraw anything but bitcoin and if something is screwed up, we all have a public ledger to look to.

Listening!  This is in the cards, however, I don't think it solves the problem.  Several banks have already blacklisted Fidor as a whole because of their affiliation with bitcoin businesses.  So, rather than telling you they won't send to Kraken or Bitcoin.de, they'll tell you they won't send to Fidor.

I'm calling this problem Schrodinger's Doge:  if you don't look, your coins are more likely to be alive than if you do.
Please correct me if I'm wrong but my understanding is that this proof requires the following:
*  a published list of every address owned by an exchange which contains customer funds.
  * security:  knowing the size of the score, one can better determine how much to spend on an attack.
  * privacy:  the more addresses that are tied to identities (in this case, the exchange), the less private your transactions are.  The less private your transactions are, the more likely you or we are to be implicated/targeted for anything.
We might have to deal with people dust bombing, miners dropping transactions because they don't like us, consequences of just having one less piece of private information between us that we can use to help verify your account absent other information.
*  a signed message from every private key required to spend from those addresses.
  * security:  you really don't want us keeping the private keys to the kingdom online, or even fumbling around with them on a regular, non-mandatory basis, especially predictably.  The more exposure the cold wallets have, the less secure they are.
And, unless the exchange has built in some mechanism for people to authenticate the claims of wrongdoing, anyone could lie and say that their funds are unaccounted for.
Yes, it would be one less thing to worry about but there's so much to worry about.  I think this problem will soon be solved by companies getting independent audits, which will be required for insurance.

From my [exposure to the situation]( this is all true.  Jed saw the forthcoming regulatory/legal nightmares, sold 88% of Gox for ~$50k, stepped out completely and let Mark take over.  From that point forward, Mark was not easily accessible to Jed.  Jed had actually received numerous juicy offers to buy his share of Gox but Mark was not cooperative with the diligence process.  I've even heard Jed complain about the amount of time he's had to wait for his USD wires to clear, that Mark was ignoring his advice.  They certainly didn't have any special relationship, and Jed didn't have any special access or priority.  I don't have any reason to believe that Jed was in any way involved in any malfeasance.  From every interaction I've had with him, he's a smart, trustworthy guy.

@_date: 2014-01-03 21:17:23
Right.  We definitely aren't randomly introducing fees to some SEPA transfers and not others.  We credit 100% of the amount received for SEPA.  If you've been credited less than you sent, check with the remitting bank.  Most likely is they sent the transfer as a wire, or they used some intermediary bank that took a fee.

Interesting theory and one I hadn't considered.. they could have been trading to pump up volume, or just day trading for fun and profit, and lost 750k coin along the way.  They could have been shorting by borrowing bitcoin from customers expecting to buy it back later.  Seems like a lot of bitcoin to lose that way though.
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:29:26
I was just trying to check out at Newegg and when I got to the payment options, bitcoin was missing.  I contacted live chat support and they informed me that bitcoin is only available on orders where 100% of the cart is sold by Newegg.  They aren't currently splitting payments, but they are working on allowing purchases for Marketplace (other sellers') orders.
In the meantime, if you're committed to paying with bitcoin, use the filters to see items sold by Newegg, or see if Bitcoinstore.com has the items.

I agree that you don't want to tie pub keys to identities, but Coinbase is tying twitter ids to identities.  They should be collecting KYC/AML docs on their users, and if they were ever hacked or NSA'd, the fallout could be just as bad or worse.  Also, you're limiting your userbase to those customers that Coinbase can serve.  I believe Blockchain.info has some great apis that might help you accomplish this sort of address proxying you want.
@_date: 2014-03-16 00:18:22

Funds would be more secure if I didn't have to trust a 3rd party with my private keys.

All those exchanges you named do have regulatory exposure.  Whether they are following those regulations that apply to them and whether those regulations are being enforced is another story.  Because of its adherence to regulation, US-based Kraken is not even servicing users for fiat trading in its home state of California.

If you're being charged, you should check with your bank.  Make sure they're not nailing you with the fee, and that they're actually sending SEPA and not by some other method.  Kraken doesn't charge any fees for SEPA on its end.

We actually did a study on this:

Jesse from Kraken here.  Unfortunately, this investigation is out of our hands.  As others have pointed out, we're at the mercy of our bank and the German authorities.  If an account is flagged for potential fraud, money laundering or other illegal activity, we're required to freeze it pending the outcome of the investigation.  I'm sorry for the inconvenience and I can assure you that we're pushing for a fast resolution.
@_date: 2014-02-22 10:56:22
Jesse from [Kraken]( here.
This is asking a lot of an exchange, and I don't think information is worth the price you're paying in security and privacy.  Your interests would be better served by a private auditor's report.
Allow me to present an alternative:  Stop giving your money to people who keep screwing up, and stop giving your money to people whose faces you've never seen.  If you want to be extreme, stop using services that are operating illegally, without the requisite licenses.
Even if your coins are there today, it doesn't mean that Dr. Evil doesn't also have a copy of the keys, and it doesn't mean that tomorrow they won't be lost, stolen, seized, or paid to miners when someone forgets to specify a change address.
I understand that this is an attempt to keep everyone honest but if you don't trust your exchange, maybe it's time to find another exchange.

Until a few months ago they did not redirect to Kraken.  Notice the registration date on ntgox.com is June 24th, 2011.  That was about a week after the infamous hack, and before Payward was even incorporated.  At the time I purchased it, I had no intention of running my own exchange--I was looking for (and seeking to eliminate) other Gox security threats and typo domains was one of them.  Just over 2 years later, Kraken opened for business and I pointed all my bitcoin related domains at Kraken, except bitcoinembassy.com.  I haven't gone after other exchanges' typos but I'd argue that doing so would be a legitimate business tactic and would damn sure be better than someone evil taking them.  Mark hasn't asked for the typos but if he did, I'd be happy to sell them back to him at cost, for BTC at the rate on June 24th, 2011.
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:04:08
I highly doubt it was theft, at least not theft for Mark's own personal benefit.  The guy has a target on his head and he's almost certainly going to prison if this is found to be anything other than an honest mistake of lost keys.  What amount of money could be worth that, plus the guy is a true believer in Bitcoin, and an early adopter.  He could have sold Gox for millions if he were after cash.
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:59:48
We should be publishing the results of our audit early next week.  You certainly should demand other exchanges prove it, and you should check their proof.

Bloomberg:  
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:38:20
Yeah, it would have been about 12%.  When Gox got hacked in 2011, their database leak revealed around 60,000 users, with a large percentage being early adopters.  There wasn't anywhere else to trade, and bitcoin wasn't worth that much so people didn't think anything of keeping tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of bitcoin there at the time.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:57:22
My point was that it's obviously very easy to make unsubstantiated allegations about a competitor.  Anyone can do it, about anything.  Had Davout posed it as a question, my response would have been different.
@_date: 2014-01-01 23:01:29
You mean it's not a smart move for Gox to leave those domains in someone else's hands for over 2.5 years?  When I registered those domains, I had no plans for Kraken.  It was done to protect people from scammers.  I only eventually started Kraken because Gox was doing a poor job.  I happened to have the domains so why not try to recoup some of my costs?  If Gox wants them, they're for sale.
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:30:47
Data could be useful to help start providing some relief to Gox victims.  If we had a way to authenticate victims, we might as a community be able to provide some services, regional support networks, donations to cover some basic living expenses in the worst cases.  I hope that Gox users don't need to suffer identity theft on top of their losses.

I'm still not seeing any specific statutes mentioned, nor explanation of how those specific statutes pertain to our particular business model.


Source?  Exceptions?
We don't offer Ripple IOUs and we don't offer margin trading yet.
I think that without explaining to your our entire legal strategy and analysis of the law, I'm simply going to have to say that you're wrong and if you think you're right, I invite you to report us to the regulatory authorities and law enforcement immediately.
The idea that nobody knows how to be fully compliant is BS.  We've had discussions with regulators in EU, and we've given them our analysis and we have letters back from them that they agree with our analysis and we're clear to operate.  It's tough, and it's expensive, and you have to wait a long time to get those meetings and get those letters but it is doable.
I'm afraid I can't justify spending more time on this but perhaps some independent 3rd party can at some point review our exchanges for compliance and we'll see how everyone does then.

I've just looked in to this with Fidor and internally.  It looks like there may actually be a bug on our end.  The deposit amount with Fidor is 500 EUR, and the details on your deposit in Kraken say 500 EUR, 0 fee, BUT for some reason you were charged 5 EUR, and that's represented in the ledger entry on the deposit.  Going to have to dive deeper.  I'll keep you posted.  Thanks for the images.  We'll get this sorted out and your funds properly credited.  Sorry about the trouble!
@_date: 2015-05-20 14:01:13
Only XBT/EUR can be traded on margin right now.  The other markets aren't liquid enough.  What do you mean "one-up the security model"?  There are some regulatory concerns around the customer-provided liquidity model.
@_date: 2014-02-27 11:10:42
Not only that but people who didn't know better were seeing Gox appear at the top of search results for bitcoin, at the top of charting sites for bitcoin, mentioned all over the media as THE exchange.  If Gox was known to be so terrible, why not delist it from every bitcoin resource and plaster the warnings everywhere to save the noobs from disaster?  I think a lot of people knew of the problems with Gox but there certainly wasn't a rally to dethrone them.  People had plenty of opportunity to vote with their business and continued to vote for Gox.  Unfortunately, a lot of people didn't have the information to price the risk, and they ended up losing out the most.

Actually, we operate under our banking partner's license in the EU.  In the United States, we're registered with FinCEN but we don't have state money transmission licenses, which is why we're not servicing most of the US.  In the rest of the world, Bitcoin is largely unregulated and licenses aren't necessary.  But we've only spent a million bucks on legal so what do I know.

I think it would be difficult to find an expert in the space who is not conflicted by virtue of being closely connected to people who have lost something in Gox or Bitcoinica.
We filed suit against Strateman, Taaki and Norman to pressure them in to accelerating distributions as a whole, before Bitcoinica went in to liquidation.  Once the liquidator took over, the creditors asked to have the remaining bitcoin in Gox removed for safer storage, and Strateman refused to facilitate the process, and the liquidator in NZ failed to encourage him or Gox comply.  So, the case remains open.  I don't know if there's anything left to get out of Strateman but a promise to be helpful in the process going forward.  The NZ liquidator will likely be treated as any other Gox creditor.
I'll be in the same line with everyone else, as will other Kraken employees, investors and friends.  It's likely that the claims will be vetted by Deloitte and Kraken will only make payouts at the direction of the trustee.

@_date: 2015-01-19 10:58:25
off the top of my head..
* allowed database to be compromised - hacker modifies his own balance, withdraws coins through the normal channels.
* allowed client accounts to be compromised - hacker social engineers his way to gaining access or client info is somehow exposed to hackers through the website.
* allowed wallet(s) to be compromised - server is hacked, inside job or appropriate people are physically held hostage
* allowed website to be compromised - hacker replaces legit deposit addresses with his own, intercepting new deposits
We've seen (other exchanges) hacked via security holes with their host (Bitcoinica/Linode) and data center (Canadian Bitcoins/Granite Networks).  We've also seen failure to properly implement a cryptocurrency gateway resulting in losses (Gox/Transaction Malleability) and (Justcoin/Ripple).  The Justcoin/Ripple scenario was arguably Ripple Labs' fault for not actively updating their documentation and not actively updating exchanges and gateways of the changes they were making to the protocol.
@_date: 2015-01-21 22:21:45
Kraken doesn't have any state money transmitter licenses at this time.  Our full set of services are offered in the few states that don't have MTL requirements, and a limited set of services, like crypto-crypto trading, are offered in most states, where existing money transmission laws don't capture the activity.  So, you're still right.. Kraken isn't operating illegally because we're only offering services that we can offer without a license.

SEPA is usually credited at Kraken same day.  If you have an account at Fidor Bank, it's instant.
@_date: 2015-01-27 00:27:44
My understanding is that even with licenses in hand, CoinX was unable to secure a solid banking relationship.  The lack of banking support is why we haven't seen agency relationships emerge with Bitcoin exchanges and existing license holders.  You just can't get the banks' support.  Coinbase proves more than anything what a monopoly on a US bank account is actually worth--at least $400m to date.
@_date: 2015-01-26 23:40:19
"Not available in your state" is only a problem to the extent you are poor.  If you want to trade, take $200 to your nearest state or foreign country in which the service is available, register yourself a corporation and use the service through that.

You might feel like Bitstamp's exposure to criminal prosecution for violating the laws of your state represent an unacceptable counter party risk.  You might rather use an exchange that is operating within the law, where your funds are less likely to be locked up indefinitely during an ongoing prosecution or liquidation period.  Your risk tolerance is up to you.  If I were trading millions, $200 for peace of mind would be worth it.

We aren't allowed to facilitate 3rd party payments.. if you send money to Kraken it has to be deposited in to a Kraken account in your name, and if you withdraw, it has to go back to a bank account in your name.
I'm not sure Fidor is taking on more Bitcoin business at the moment.  The best thing you can do to land a bank account for handling customer funds is put together a really great compliance program.  That will be expensive, unfortunately.
Apart from Fidor, any other SEPA-EUR bank would be quick and cheap--usually same day.

Thank you!  We're shutting down Coinsetter and Cavirtex and will migrate all the users over to Kraken so, you'll have two accounts but if you would like to consolidate the balances in to one account, we can help with that.  Unfortunately, we aren't able to support direct fiat/fiat pairs yet.

@_date: 2015-01-19 11:18:38
Really would be impossible to know for sure without a constant and ongoing audit of all the exchanges simultaneously but here are some reasons why Kraken might have a reputation for being more secure:
* Published first cryptographically verifiable audit (afaik)
* Discovered critical flaw in Namecoin
* Unaffected by transaction malleability
* Website supports encrypted email and other advanced security features
* Chosen by Fidor Bank to partner in Cryptocurrency Bank initiative
* Chosen by Japanese bankruptcy trustee to assist in Gox liquidation
* Rated 11/10 on Security by [TheBlogChain](
Counter party risk is about more than technical security though.  Kraken has taken an extremely conservative approach to operating its business, choosing to heed regulation and avoid risky features like leverage (until it can be done properly).  If I had my bitcoin with exchanges that clearly misreport their numbers, who are servicing the US illegally, who are offering risky products, I wouldn't be getting much sleep.  If Bitstamp could be hacked, how many of these other exchanges are running fractional and just haven't admitted to it yet?
@_date: 2016-01-21 03:18:46
Yes, we do.  The exchanges in Japan are at war--it's 0 fees all over the place, even some doing rebates.  For that reason, the volumes aren't really comparable.  If you're familiar with the Japanese market, I'd love to hear from you what you think we could improve on there to win market share.
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:16:23
No plans at the moment but I don't think more consolidation would be a bad thing.  We are open to acquiring more exchanges, and open to being acquired.
@_date: 2016-01-21 00:17:02
We'll be shutting down Coinsetter and Cavirtex entirely shortly following the user migration to Kraken on Jan 26th.  We'll be sticking with our own engine at Kraken.
@_date: 2016-01-20 22:58:40
Simple economics--the market isn't large enough to justify the cost (including opportunity cost, risk, maintenance, customer service, real estate on the site).  Admittedly, some of the other coins we support would not pass the test today.  It might be about time we delisted a few things.

Great advice.  Please don't keep more money in any exchange (including Kraken) than you are actively trading with.  We'll try to prove our reserves on a regular basis going forward but as long as someone else holds the keys to your funds, you have counterparty risk.  People make mistakes and governments make seizures and nobody can guarantee that they're 100% hackproof.

I know that the investigation is still ongoing but it's been out of our hands for a while and the trustee isn't sharing anything about it with us.  I believe the trustee is still working on getting funds back from the seized Wells Fargo account in the US, CoinLab, maybe others.

Consumer demand but it's a bit of a chicken and egg problem.  I'd be really curious to see the numbers for FoldApp and Purse.io.  Are these services exploding with new users trying to get 20% off at Starbucks and Amazon?  If not, why not?  I have 40 people every day trying to invite me to some new chat app yet no interest in saving 20% everything?  How can we explain this behavior?
I think that people just prefer not to think about money (maybe it's subconsciously a sore topic) and they want instant gratification, to just pay for something mindlessly and hope it works out.  If you have any experience in e-commerce UX, you know that even a single extra click or decision at checkout can cost you massively.  Even as an experienced Bitcoiner, I find myself struggling with payments because I'm thinking "what's the exchange rate, do I really want to spend at this exchange rate, is Chainalysis going to inform my health insurance provider of this purchase at Cups and Cakes Bakery?"
IMO, wallet apps need to become much more social (which people seem to be willing be perpetually distracted by) or much simpler to use, with less thinking involved, and with incentives (like cash: fast, anonymous or credit: 30 day loan, airline miles).
Still, I think adoption will come slowly as more merchants getting on board, which will spread awareness to the consumer, who will in turn start demanding it elsewhere.

It hasn't coalesced yet and there will arguably be less reason to coalesce in the future when there is even more value and more (non-crypto) assets involved.  Blockchains that are used for dealing with other assets may have their own coins, or may have coins pegged to bitcoin.  It doesn't seem like Bitcoin is optimal for every imaginable use case so I fully expect there to be multiple blockchains and multiple cryptocurrencies with varying properties.  We'll likely even see state backed fiat-cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:31:25
The only other coins I've paid attention to recently are Zcash and Tendermint.  Adding new coins can be dangerous and they should be thoroughly evaluated.  (see [Namecoin]( [Ripple]( [LuckyCoin](  Given the amount of time it takes and the value of the time of those people capable of doing the evaluating, the risks and ongoing maintenance, the projected revenue needs to be pretty high.  With most coins, there's an early pump, a lot of action and then interest in trading dies off.  I'd say for us to add a coin, we need to believe we'd make at least $100k/yr over the next 5 years.
TLDR; not actively and no timeline

We have constant, daily contact with a plethora of law enforcement agencies and the Alliance serves to alleviate that burden through better coordination, having someone to intercept questions for the industry, developing standards, etc.  I think it's gotten a bad rap.  It's definitely not about getting everyone together to break the law and turn over information without warrants or anything like that.  For example, one initiative that has come out of it is helping teach law enforcement how to scale back on their asks, and agreeing on a standard format for information requests.  This is all helpful to us as we have to provide staff, with no reimbursement, for the costs of interacting with law enforcement, information production, etc.

Nobody is completely immune to DDoS but yes, more protection means more money.

I'm not qualified to be giving technical direction on this topic but in the short term, I think it's important to keep bitcoin functional as a low cost transactional currency.  Process-wise, I a like slow, deliberate, considered approach which sets us up for long term success.  I think bitcoin is the killer app for Bitcoin and we should prioritize its use as global money ahead of using the blockchain for all sorts of other stuff.

Liquid aims to improve liquidity among participating exchanges through reducing the settlement time of funds transfers to 0.  The free and instant movement of funds between exchanges should allow market makers to react to changes faster, which will mean smaller spreads, less slippage, etc.
BitGo Instant is very similar though, and we just launched support for it yesterday, along with BitStamp, Bitfinex and Shapeshift.  We'll see how they compare when Liquidity rolls out.
@_date: 2016-01-21 02:28:18
We had issues being competitive with the KRW offering.  We were only able to offer it to clients within Korea, and funding was not instant, which was a dealbreaker for the Korean traders.

We'd have to see how it goes.. maybe we would give people the option to choose their chain, or automatically put them on to one or the other if no action is taken by a certain date.  If a hard fork is sustained, I don't see a reorg ever happening.
@_date: 2016-01-20 19:01:41
1.  Hard to know.  I think we've gotten better at deterring that kind of activity on the exchange, but also better at detecting it.  Law enforcement interest certainly has picked up a lot.  If you're looking to launder money, Kraken is a pretty bad choice.
2.  In the last 6 months, banks have been all over us to get a free education on Blockchain.  Unfortunately, I don't think we've made any progress with getting Bitcoin companies operational/custodial accounts.

If there were a sustained hard fork, we would support both coins.  I think this is extremely unlikely to happen, however, as it would require &gt; 75% of the miners to agree to it.  The other 25% mining the old chain would be in a very weak state and would quickly switch rather than risk being attacked by the other guys.

No major problems from governments to far, apart from the regulatory issues.  The problems with the banks are an extension of the regulatory issues.  Law enforcement are making a lot more requests of us lately, which is creating problems in that we need to hire more people to respond.
We've had 2 banks shut us down (operational accounts for rent and payroll):  Bank of America gave us 30 days notice, which was nice.  Chase gave us 5 days notice by mail and the letter did not arrive until after they'd closed the account, which caused payroll to bounce and created a ton of headaches.  I was surprised by the lack of professional courtesy.

@_date: 2016-01-21 02:12:30
I'll try to address the whole thread here.
First, let me be clear that we would like to offer something to the Havelock shareholders.  I'm just going to be real--it's not going to be anything close to what you paid for it.
1.  Presumably, shareholders would rather get something than nothing, which would be the case if the entities ultimately shut down without an exit.  An investment is not a PUT option.
2.  Investors must understand that shareholders of an entity that have gone through two acquisitions are likely to be highly diluted.
3.  Investors must understand that the Preferred class of stock has more rights, priority and preference than other types of stock when it comes to seeing returns.
4.  Cavirtex already offered to buy back the Havelock shares, and it did for many, but most chose to ride the risk and hold.
5.  The docs surrounding the Havelock shares are problematic on many levels, and they do not protect the investor to the extent that docs for a professional VC round would.
6.  The acquisition deal is not entirely settled and it's possible that hyper aggressive, litigious shareholders with unrealistic expectations could still kill it.
7.  Kraken could have simply acquired the users and left the entities/IP/other assets to be sorted out by someone else.  No other assets, including licenses, will be utilized.
8.  Jaron fought hard to make sure that investors get something back, putting them ahead of himself.  He didn't have to do this and in my book that's worth major points.
I don't mean to be a dick but I don't want to lead you guys on.  Some investments lose money.  We'll be reaching out to everyone after the deal is finally closed with the numbers.  Considering the lengths Jaron went to to protect you, I hope you will accept that whatever you get is more than what technically would have been fair.

I was lucky to have a computer in the house as a kid, back in the mid mid-late 80s.  I got in to BBSes and phreaking and 2600 magazine and that whole scene.  Then I went to college for Philosophy and became a professional flaw finder.  Then, in 2001, I started a company selling virtual items and services for online games (Diablo 2 items, WoW gold, etc) and met a whole lot more people interested in discovering exploits in game software/networking for financial gain.  Those guys tended to be interested in other things security related and I learned a lot more.  Then Bitcoin, and now I pretty much trust nothing.

Hey!  Long one...
1.  We're ultimately at the mercy of our payment partners when it comes to getting money on/off and with KYC.  That's no excuse for bad service though and it really annoys me when people get bad service -- I'm sorry about that.  We have a couple more funding options in the pipeline that should be better all around.
2.  We've since scaled up our infrastructure and made a lot of improvements.  So far, things have been good and I'm confident we'll be able to handle the next spike.
3.  Yes, actually, maybe we can increase those margin limits this week.  Since Kraken doesn't have socialized losses and we take all the risk on margin, we have more risk controls in place, like margin allowance relative to volatility and liquidity.  You can use bitcoin as collateral for margin already.
4.  Yup ^
5.  Yes, I was an early investor in Ripple and I was on the Board for a while.  I resigned from the Board and ceased to be involved with the company because it was taking a turn away from the original goal, and toward being something I wasn't interested in being a part of.  I have a lot of disagreement with the management of the company.
6.  I'm going to keep that an open question for now.  I think the market is too small to be able to deeply specialize.  That said, it's expensive to jump in to other things because they all come with different licensing requirements and compliance costs.

The weather really is nicer in California ;)  The ETH market is still pretty small.  On a good day, maybe $500k is traded.  The last few days have been exceptional, $1m-$2m.  Let's say that, generously, NY accounts for 20% of all ETH trading, and we can capture 100% of NY.. the max fees we'd collect on an ETH/XBT trade would be 0.15% (and as low as 0.05%).  If ETH is $1, and we take 0.15% of $100k, we make $150 for the day, or $4500/month.. Maybe we can raise our fees for people in NY.. even so, these are some generous estimates and the effects of applying the BitLicense to the rest of our business might actually cost us market share in other places.  For us to go in to NY, it's going to have to be a pretty big opportunity, and we'd want to do more to segregate that business from the rest of the company.  We're not there yet--I see it as a distraction.

We've already done one crypto proof of reserves but that method has some shortcomings.  That said, I think it's a good exercise, and if you were as massively short as Gox was, there'd probably be no way to hide it.

We are working on the unsupported states, with the exception of New York.  Like Coinbase, we're pursuing state-by-state money transmission.  Every state has its own consumer protection laws, licensing requirements for money transmitters/custodians of funds, and process for reviewing and approving applications.  Some states might say you don't need a license, others will give you the go ahead while your application is pending, others will refuse your application entirely because they don't know what to do about Bitcoin yet.  Unfortunately, the system is very fragmented.
Gemini has chosen the trust company approach, which gives them a majority of states but they'll need to figure something out for the others.  ItBit has also done the NY trust company but their interpretation is that it covers them for all states.

Bitcoin Classic or a 2mb hard fork?  I've probably spent 100 hours at this point keeping up with all the debate.  I feel like I can't answer the question without writing a book.

I looked it to your ticket and the matter has already been addressed with you privately.  If we approve you for your tier upgrade and then come back to you later after you've made a large bank transfer, it is because our banking/payments partner has demanded it as part of their own enhanced risk/aml controls, which may at times exceed or differ from our own.
We certainly haven't disappeared to anywhere and we haven't stolen your money.  Worst case scenario for you is that we return your funds.  Unfortunately, as long as we continue to rely on legacy financial institutions, we will continue to experience these sorts of headaches.  I do apologize for the slow response support response time -- we're a bit behind on tickets due to the recent spike in activity.

I see you've made it your life's work to disparage Kraken.  If you were adversely affected by the site's latency during the volatility in early January, please submit a support ticket and we'll see what we can do for you.  We suffered two DoS attacks between the 4th and 12th which contributed to the to the site's poor response times during heavy trading.  We're working on improvements and scalability but the API will probably forever be a more reliable way to trade just given that there are fewer components to it.
The claim that we have "lost millions of client funds" is ridiculous, and false.  Some may have missed an opportunity to sell at a profit and some may have missed the opportunity to sell at a loss, and there's always someone on the other side of every trade.  That Kraken would risk major reputational damage, thousands of support tickets and lost trading fees during peak activity just to let some of our guys (who shouldn't be trading anyway) throw in a bet on an unpredictable market is ludicrous.
Kraken is a profitable, VC-backed business with over 50 employees.  We've played the long game and put our clients first from day one and it has paid off.  We're doing very well now with a legitimate business and we're one of the few exchanges to actually *not* have lost client funds.  You can trust that if the site goes offline, we're all working our asses off to get it back up and that it's not contrived just to sneak in some trades against you.
I hope you do write in and give us an opportunity to address your specific grievance.  I can appreciate your looking out for your fellow traders, however, if you want to warn against exchanges that have "lost millions of client funds", you have no shortage of real examples.

Good topic for next blog post.  We certainly don't front run our clients.  For the uninitiated, there was some debate as to whether Kraken should have allowed clients to have accelerated confirmations for Ethereum funding if they posted collateral (to mitigate the rollback/fork risk).

If you can PM me your ticket number, I can follow up on it.  I'm sorry you've had trouble with the funding.  Ethers are credited at 3000 confirmations (~12 hours) now.
NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE:  Personally, I'm still holding 100% of my eth.  I do think it's undervalued at 0.01 XBT but, of course, I could be wrong.  We'll see what happens when the banks open up on Monday.  I think bitcoin is undervalued at $1000 and so I'm holding that too.  Obviously, people don't think they're worth that today.
Also, if we actually wanted to sell eth at those opening prices, we could have just contacted the buyers privately to arrange something off-market.  Why open it up and do it publicly and risk such allegations?
@_date: 2015-08-09 12:17:35
Some have speculated that Kraken sold ether on the Ethereum ether books ahead of opening ether funding to most clients.  This isn't true but people are upset because the price is down since then and they see it as though they had a right to take those orders ahead of the other clients that got them.
@_date: 2015-08-09 12:15:19
It might be but from our conversations, other states and other countries are looking for a much looser approach.  If others follow the BitLicense, we'll need to have enough business there to justify it, and we'll need to find a way to segregate our other users from the privacy violations.
@_date: 2015-08-07 14:25:14
That's right.  It's not that we're forcing people to wait arbitrarily.. the reason to wait is the risk associated with a double spend in the first 24 hours.  I'm not sure what the disadvantage is of waiting so I can't say whether it's unfair.

Just trying to have some fun with it.  My last business was actually selling virtual currency and services for MMORPGs.
Pulling back is not ideal for a company trying to grow, however, the costs here far outweigh any short/medium term benefits.  We can always take a shot at New York later.  Right now, we've got the rest of the world to worry about.  Why blow our bankroll and compromise our global clientbase just to fight over the small NY market?
@_date: 2015-08-07 13:43:40
Market price protection means that your order would have resulted in a &gt; 5% price slippage.  For example, say you wanted to buy 2 XBT and at the top of the book was 1 at $100 and the next 1 at $200.  Your order would be canceled to protect you from what is probably a mistake.  You can avoid this by placing a limit order.
5760 confirmations (roughly 24 hours) were recommended by the Ethereum developers in case of the necessity to roll back/fork.  Clients who would like to have their ether credited in less time/fewer confirmations are encouraged to contact support about providing collateral in other assets.

Unfortunately, I can't comment on the status or findings of the investigation yet.  What's "missing" was the sum of the account balances minus the recovered bitcoin.  It's possible that some account balances will be determined to be unsubstantiated/fraudulent and those claims will not be acknowledged, which would mean that the pool of funds available to the other creditors with legit/approved claims receive more of the share.
@_date: 2015-08-09 13:50:18
Actually, I don't agree with that.  It's very expensive to comply with New York.  Maybe we'll take that money and put it to better use elsewhere and revisit New York with a flush war chest later.  Small companies attempting to comply with New York might burn themselves up before they even have a business.  Consumers outside of New York might refuse to use exchanges that are compliant with the BitLicense out of their own protection.  If you've raised $100m+, I'd say sure, it's probably worth that long-term gamble.  If you've raised less, it's much less clear.

I mentioned somewhere in the Ethereum subs that some users did slip through before we instituted the 6000 confirms requirement, and there were also collateral/credit relationships that allowed some users to be safely credited ahead of 6000 confirmations.  This is nothing new for Ethereum--we have done this for Bitcoin forever.
I'm not sure what would have made the launch "fair".  It's as if you're suggesting some suckers didn't know what the price should have been and you didn't have your "fair" chance to take advantage of them.

Actually, you can blame Blizzard for not doing a damn thing about controlling dupes, bots, spam.  They've failed to patch years-old exploits that are publicly known and reported to them in detail.  They even turned OFF Warden, a tool that had been doing a decent job of controlling it all.

Yes, I have, however, if you ask me what the majority of Bitcoin business is today, I'm still going to say drugs, porn and gambling.  If you don't want to use Bitcoin because other people use it for those things, you better burn all your cash USD, shut off the Inernet, throw away your computer and move in to a cave.  Those industries lead the way in many new technologies and I think that Bitcoin gaining traction there is a real positive sign that it's not long before mainstream adoption.
My joke, of course, wasn't revealing so much as it was simply acknowledging Bitcoin's very real PR problem, which they were all well aware of.  We should be thankful to all the sensationalist media for getting Bitcoin as much coverage as it has.  Invariably, people ask me about this and it has to be addressed.  I'm quick to say "yes it's true BUT.. it's popular in those industries because... IT'S TOTALLY AWESOME FOR ALL INDUSTRIES (except for maybe payment services)."  I can't control the truth and if you ask me for it and you choose to write it down, I can't stop you.
Also, I'm not Bitcoin's paid PR spokesperson and I'm not responsible for Bitcoin's image.  What was said casually over dinner to a group of highly intelligent/experienced financiers is not necessarily indicative of how I would pitch Bitcoin to the general public.  I'm a huge proponent of Bitcoin and flew myself to Vegas, put myself up in a hotel, paid for that overpriced conference pass, and spent 2 days on 2 hours of sleep singing the praises of Bitcoin to conference goers, setting people up with mobile wallets and even starting them off with a free Bitcoin.

The problem with being "*in your face* about it" is it creates a lot of friction for new signups and they'll lose a lot of signsups to exchanges that adopt the practice they have now, which from a business perspective makes perfect sense--it's the way everybody does it.

Most bank terms of service say that if you give someone else your credentials, you're responsible for whatever happens on your account.

if you'd read the instructions you'd know that players turn in accounts that they have received for free with their orders from Lewt.  If you don't have a mule account from Lewt, you can buy a $0.25 item and get one.  Of course nobody would turn in an account more valuable than the prize they're getting.  The reason they do this is the exact reason they cannot flip awesome accounts--if you didn't create the account, you can steal it back.

for Dwolla to Dwolla transfers, I'm not sure what their policy is but for ACH, the account holder has at least 60 days from the time they receive their monthly bank statement to file a dispute.  So, consider that 90 days, but even then the money isn't guaranteed.. they'll just have a harder time disputing the transfer.  Personally, I don't see ACH/Dwolla much better than Credit Cards/PayPal, apart from the lower transaction fees.  Dwolla used to say 'no chargebacks' before they screwed over Tradehill, then changed their policy.  If you want to be sure you'll keep your money, get a bank wire, cash deposit Western Union, or Bitcoin.

That amount is divided among 4 guys, and it's not stated how much of it is owed in terms of Bitcoin.  When Bitcoinica went down, the price was about $4.95, and at the time the complaint was filed the price was closer to $10.
There was a contract: the Terms of Service.  The lawsuit mentions breach of contract, among other things.  Nobody thought that the people in charge were as incompetent as they turned out to be.  You shouldn't be surprised--most people know far less about who runs their bank than we do about the Bitcoinica/Intersango crew.

We advised the trustee that if they were to sell any coins \(not advised\), they should do it in an auction, which we would be happy to facilitate. This was months ago. We never heard anything again about the coin sale until the creditors meeting, along with the general public. It's possible they're getting guidance from someone else.

I presume you know (the real reason) why the bank is no longer willing to process fiat payments for you, and why Kraken has to close your account. The recommendation is to withdraw your funds in crypto before they are frozen indefinitely. Of course, you don't have to buy crypto with your fiat, or even withdraw it. We can't guarantee a timely return of your fiat if you choose to leave it in your account at the time of closure.

Right, you do not need to make any deposits or withdrawals to become Tier 2.  Those are just limits on funding, and those limits will not apply to withdrawing your gox payouts later.
@_date: 2015-04-22 16:29:20
Not so.  Sorry, it's a little confusing.  It's $1000 worth of trade fee credits no matter what tier you're at.  If you're at the 0.1% tier, it's $1mm worth of free trades; if you're at the 0.35% tier, it's ~$285k worth of free trades.
@_date: 2015-04-23 19:34:26
The trustee has said that the bitcoin would be valued at $483 but I think this is going to be problematic going forward so I wouldn't rely on it.  If they had to convert all the BTC to JPY toady, they'd be getting more like $200/coin, so there's no way they could promise people $483 for their coin.  How to handle BTC distributions in a bankruptcy is a new problem that they're trying to solve for the first time.  We won't know until later on how the bitcoin will be valued for purposes of conversion and distribution in lieu of JPY.  My guess is that they'll have to reassign a value to the bitcoin at the time of distribution and give people the choice to take a payout in JPY or BTC at that rate.  Hopefully, we'll get some clarification around this soon.  It'd be great to get more input from the community on what would be desirable/fair.

I might be wrong but, if I remember correctly, it was taken on the day MtGox officially entered in to bankruptcy.  Anyway, the rate would only matter if the price of bitcoin were to get above $2500 or so by the time payouts were determined.

There could be fees deducted from your payout depending on the payout method you choose.  Other than that, the costs of the liquidation process are already coming out of the total pool of funds shared by all creditors.  Negatives might just be that you're attaching your identity to your Gox account in order to make the claim.
@_date: 2015-04-22 16:00:16
You don't need to have received the letter in the mail to make a claim.  If your Gox account had a positive balance on it when the service went down, you should be able to enter a claim now.  Definitely don't email us your login credentials.

There was plenty of 100% legit, legal activity happening on the Silk Road.  I'm sure law enforcement has provided the trustee with a list of suspicious accounts, and those will be asked for additional information, if claims are made for them.  The trustee is aware of the accounts that might be controlled by Mark, Jed and others which will require extra scrutiny.  Rather than subject all claimants to the level of scrutiny they'd apply to the most suspicious accounts, they've chosen to spare the innocent from this process and only ask for more information where it's necessary.  So, just because they haven't yet asked you for scans of your ids and other information, it doesn't mean that they won't be asking others for it.
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:37:30

It's not the trustee's job to deal with AML/KYC issues.  Their job is to get the rightful account owners paid.  If users can prove that they own the account without producing identity documents, they're fine with that.  If they are suspicious about some claims, they might ask for additional information, including ID scans.
@_date: 2015-04-23 19:38:49
Yeah, I think many people are in the same boat.  The trustee can't roll back any trades but they can try to find a way to handle the bitcoin and fiat holders equally and fairly so that it wouldn't matter whether you had your fiat back or btc at the time of payout.
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:34:35
We haven't yet, and it is our goal to not liquidate any of the bitcoin.  We think it'd be better for everyone if funds could be returned in the form of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-22 16:19:18
The trustee has not yet disclosed how they will evaluate the claims.  My assumption is that they'll be looking at final balances in most cases.  In some cases where the claim is questionable or the account is suspicious, they might look at recent funding events and trades to determine what the payout amount should be.
@_date: 2015-04-22 05:42:35
Correct.  Submitting a claim does not entitle you to a payout.  claims will be evaluated and probably some will be rejected.  We don't yet know what percentage will be returned but, based on what's left and what is believed to be missing, it will likely not be greater than 20%.
@_date: 2015-04-22 15:54:19
If you file through Gox, you don't have to engage with Kraken, which some might see as a benefit.
If you file through Kraken, you get:
* 100,000 KFEE credits redeemable for up to $1 million in free trading volume at the lowest fee tier of 0.1%
* Creditor claim and payout support with live chat and email
* Option to receive funds in the form of Bitcoin
* An easier and more convenient process from claim to payout
@_date: 2015-04-23 05:37:23

If we're forced to liquidate the BTC, we would try to find a way for the creditors to have first dibs at buying them back.  On an open market, we would not be able to guarantee any particular price.  How much they go for would depend on what the market price is a the time.

There are ongoing recovery efforts happening outside of Japan that might take quite a while to resolve.  Rather than hold up the distribution indefinitely, the trustee has chosen to move forward with the process with what they've got right now.  If they are able to recover more assets after payouts have been made, there will be a subsequent round of payouts later.

MtGox was storing 5 decimal places for USD, and 8 for BTC.  So, I believe that says 135.65004718 BTC and $0.46701 USD.  If you're not able to remember your password, you can still file by paper, offline.

Yes, any MtGox user who had a &gt; 0 balance on the exchange when it went down would be a creditor.  The trustee is asking for a lot of information to help them verify the authenticity of the claim.  I think a lot of it is standard stuff that is mandatory and usual in the process of a bankruptcy procedure.
@_date: 2015-04-22 05:38:57
I'm the co-founder and CEO of Kraken.  We've been appointed by the trustee to assist in in the liquidation process.
Definitely all of the bitcoin will be claimed and distributed.  There is some 850k+ that could be claimed so whatever doesn't get claimed will just be distributed to everyone else pro rata.  If you've read the recent Wizsec report on the missing coin, you probably would not expect to receive any more than 20% back.
@_date: 2015-04-22 16:23:31
Exactly.  Kraken should be able to offer better withdrawal rates.  For example, if you're in the EU, it's 0.09 euros to make a SEPA withdrawal.  If you were taking your payout directly from the trustee, it would be an international wire fee.
@_date: 2015-04-24 19:38:51
Rather than invade the privacy of everyone across the board, the trustee has chosen to only ask for Tier 3 info (id scans) for those accounts that have been claimed more than once, or that are suspicious, or otherwise disputed.

I can't say whether it's accurate but it basically confirmed what everyone already assumed was the worst--that the coins are long gone and it seems like we won't find more than the 200k of the 850k+ that are expected to be owed.

the lowest price you can buy at would be the lowest price someone is selling at.  So, if you were to buy at the time you took that snapshot, you'd be able to buy 2.147 BTC for €248.76998.  If you wanted to buy 3 BTC, you'd have to dip in to the next sell order, so, you'd buy another 0.853 at €248.77.  You could do it all in one order by making a limit order to buy 3 BTC at €248.77.  Since your bid would be overlapping the ask, your order would be filled immediately and two trades would execute to do it:  one for 2.147 at €248.76998, and another for 0.835 at €248.77.  The matching engine will always give you the best price and will not skip over cheaper orders just because you put in an offer to buy at a higher price.

I wish we could have offered you a better experience at Kraken.  The AML/KYC stuff can be over the top but believe me when I say that it is not in our interest to make using our service frustrating.  We do what is required of us to keep the business going.  Rules around AML/KYC vary by country but in most cases, if you're buying under $1000 worth of bitcoin in a day, the requirements are fairly minimal and do not include scans of identity/residence documents.  If we do require documents from you and they're all good, it shouldn't take more than a few hours to be verified.  Apologies for the trouble and I hope you give us another shot in the future.

I believe the purpose of assigning the exchange rate back in early 2014 was to get a single fiat-denominated value for all of the Gox assets, and for each account.  Once you have those values locked in, you can determine what % of the total each account makes up and distribute accordingly.
My guess is what will happen when payouts become available is that you will be presented with a fiat value (approved claim with 2014 exchange rates), and the choice to:
1. receive a bank wire in that amount (likely JPY)
 - not ideal because most would prefer not to have JPY, not to pay ~$50 wire fee, not to deal with JPY-&gt;other fiat FX conversion costs.
 - we'll see what we can do to avoid FX costs, unnecessary conversions (though they may be legally mandated)
2. receive fiat credit to Kraken account
 - you'd be able to withdraw or trade it from there
3. convert the fiat value in to bitcoin at whatever the exchange rate happens to be in that moment.
 - I would advise using a reputable price index.
 - bitcoin will arrive on user's Kraken account and can be withdrawn as bitcoin or converted to fiat, withdrawn through cheaper/faster options from there.
Ideally, the desired form of distribution would closely match what the trustee is holding and not require massive conversions of fiat to bitcoin and vice versa.
The expectation is that most people will take their distribution in bitcoin.  If that happens, I think it'll be a great example of bitcoin's superiority in terms of ease, speed and cost vs the existing system for transmitting fiat internationally.

I believe that is the deadline the trustees set to submit a claim, on the assumption that the claims system would be made available by April 1st.  The claims form has not yet been revealed, and if it is not revealed by April 1st, it's likely that the deadline to submit a claim will be pushed back as well.

Great to hear :)  Unfortunately, Germany is one of those places where the AML/KYC requirements are higher.  This is due to the requirements of our banking partner in Germany, Fidor Bank, and to the high incidence of fraud in Germany thanks to generally weak security controls around online banking in Germany.  If you happen to have an account with Fidor, once you're set up with Kraken, you can move money back and forth instantly.

Perhaps a necessary move with extra scrutiny on the business coming out of consumer protection arms of California and New York who've recently issued warnings about the unlicensed operation of Coinbase' services in their states.
@_date: 2015-02-05 08:54:00


"Compliance" is about a lot more than just knowing your customer.  You have to figure out which bodies of law apply to you, which jurisdictions you're availing yourself to, what your requirements are under the laws of the countries and states where you have exposure (your home jurisdiction, your clients' jurisdictions and any other jurisdiction you might have "minimum contacts" with.  Chances are you'll be subject to some form of financial services or consumer protection law.  What you need to comply with could be anywhere from zero regulation around your business to an explicit requirement for licensing/approval from government, self-regulatory organizations and other gatekeepers.  So, compliance and AML/KYC requirements vary as much as the law varies.
KYC in the United States is meant to serve two purposes:  1.  prevent blacklisted people from benefitting from your service; 2.  facilitate the investigation of crimes.


The cost of KYC is tremendous.  A proper AML/KYC program requires a staff and technology to facilitate ongoing transaction monitoring even after a user has cleared the initial verification process.  The most frustrating thing is that everyone I have ever talked to in the compliance and law enforcement industries has told me that they think it's ineffective.  It's just a ~~barrier to entry~~ cost of doing business.
The second most frustrating thing would be that there is no clear definition of requirements.  It's up to each business to determine what the threats are and where its weaknesses might be.  The system has to constantly evolve.  Our job is never done.  Personally, I don't think there's anything inherently suspicious about being super private, mixing your coins, etc.  My personal beliefs are often at odds with "best practices", unfortunately.  I think people ought to be fearful of the amount of information that is being collected on them.


I understand that cutting off your enemy's resources is a powerful tactic in war but, as a business, I would prefer not to participate.  If you're running a financial service, consider yourself a conscript, and by the way, you have to build your own weapons and feed yourself on top of trying to stay alive, and if you don't defend the line well enough we'll throw you in the brig.  My preference would be to remain neutral, act in the best interest of my clients and not invade their privacy.  KYC/AML creates a huge burden for the business and a poor experience for the client, and an ongoing threat to the client in the form of a data breach.
I would love not take any personal information from clients.  The custodianship of your information, like the custodianship of your bitcoin is counter party risk.  I wish we had some sort of multisig way to handle identity.  Identity, obviously, is a huge problem that someone is going to make billions solving.


Massive fines and prison are high up on the list of reasons why Kraken operates very conservatively, and within the law.  There's a huge contingent liability hanging over most players in the industry who have chosen to chase a fast payday and service markets, like the United States, without the necessary licenses.  If there is ever enforcement, we might see more people going to prison and client funds locked up for years while bled away by liquidators.  Know your counter party risk.


Pressure to do AML/KYC ultimately comes from the government.  Bitcoin exchanges are financial services, and in many ways treated like banks.  Banks always ask us to see our AML/KYC program before considering opening an account--that's part of their own AML/KYC program.  Pressure comes in the form of audits and the ability to grant and take away licenses.

Usually it works like this:  Cops go to our bank and say "this transfer might be fraudulent or otherwise criminal, please lock the account and funds".  Bank passes on the request to us.  We can then comply with the bank or say goodbye to our bank account.  Whether the requests are appropriate or just or followed strict legal procedure or whatever is totally irrelevant to us.  We are at the mercy of our banking partners, without whom we would not have a business (today).
Back in ~2002 I had my PayPal account locked for 6 months, without notice, which at the time contained every penny I had to my name.  I nearly lost my business and nearly became homeless as a result.  Believe me when I say that I can appreciate how fucked up it is to have your funds wrongfully seized.  I won't make any excuses for the system.  Unfortunately, it's something we're going to have to continue to deal with until we've got total crypto domination.  In the meantime, to the extent possible, control your own private keys.
To OP, please accept my apologies.  I have followed up with our team internally and wheels are already turning to get this resolved.

That's the beauty of the blockchain--it doesn't take a Big Four accountant to verify bitcoin holdings.  The audit was not, nor was it meant to be a complete and comprehensive audit of all of Kraken's assets, liabilities, risks and exposure.  It was only meant to confirm that Kraken had, at the time of audit, at least enough bitcoin under its control to cover all of the client bitcoin balances.  Obviously, the crypto audit has some shortcomings and would not suffice as a "thorough financial examination" of the entire company.

Kraken CEO here.  Your data, like your coins, is a liability.  Unlike your coins, there is no business need to have your data (apart from possibly chargeback/fraud mitigation).  We don't sell, share or monetize your data -- it has NEGATIVE economic value.  We don't want it.  It's expensive to collect, store and secure it.  It's expensive to process and verify it.  It's expensive to produce it when demanded by countless regulators, tax authorities and law enforcement agencies for their endless fishing expeditions.  Financial services firms are conscripts in the war on everything, and the penalty for desertion is execution.  Ever hear of [Operation Chokepoint](  If it were up to me, we'd stop collecting [PII]( tomorrow because it's spending money to drive business away.  No rational company voluntarily puts up massive hurdles in the way of collecting your money.

It should be buying up as much volume it can with the funds you have available, then canceling when your available funds get to 0 and it's not able to purchase enough to completely fill your order.
If it's doing something different from that, or you see that as a problem, let me know.  Are you sure the order isn't getting partially filled before it cancels?

Take Profit is a market order.  Once the Take Profit price is reached, a market order is triggered.  I'm guessing you set the price at 780 EUR, and the next order you bought in to at market was 792 EUR.

It sounds like you haven't used their service.  They basically do everything PayPal does.
1.  It doesn't matter if they buy and sell Bitcoin directly.  They're still an exchanger.  If this were a loophole, MtGox would say it does the same thing--there isn't a reason that they couldn't be a counterparty to every transaction.
2.  Coinbase is a wallet that allows users to keep not only the BTC that Coinbase has exchanged for them, but also any other BTC they wish to deposit.  Users may transfer this BTC to other Coinbase users or they may transfer this BTC to external addresses.  Coinbase controls all the keys and retains the ultimate authority over the accounts and funds.
BTC is "value that substitutes for currency" and if you're taking it from A and sending it on to B, you're a money transmitter.

If you could pick some things for a sort of Dashboard page with all the important stuff you want to see in one place, what would you put on it?
1.  Correct
2.  Correct, though apart from the Ripple exchange, this would require us to keep an account and funds on deposit with the other exchanges we're routing trades to in order to be able to execute trades there.  This would also require those other exchanges to have reliable service otherwise failed routing attempts, old data could negatively impact our service.
3.  Correct, Kraken lends funds for margin trading out of its own pocket.  We do not lend customer deposits.  So, in cases where Kraken does not have sufficient funds, margin available will be limited.  Also, users are assigned margin limits per account so that one guy can't use up all the available funds.  The limit during beta is $25,000.

Thank you!
1.  The Ripple guys are friends here in San Francisco.  We'll support XRP trading alongside BTC, and we'll also serve as a Ripple IOU Gateway.
2.  My guess is that the BitInstant delays are a result of MtGox delays.  Unfortunately, getting dollars in to Bitcoin will continue to be somewhat of a hassle in the near term.  To make it much easier, big banks will have to get more comfortable with it or other irreversible payment methods will have to come online.  Expanding upon our deposit method offerings is high up on our list of priorities and something I imagine we'll be constantly working on for a long time to come.  At least the cost of a domestic wire is a lot cheaper than an international one.
3.  From a business standpoint, I suppose we should capitalize on the speculation of those altcoins.  Personally, I don't think they have a chance at long-term survival but if we can find the dev hours and the market looks worthwhile, we'll probably support them.

Yes.  Not at launch but in the very near future you'll be able to deposit and maintain balances/reserves with other national currencies.

Thanks for pointing that out.  Will update the FAQ right away.  If we could service you, you'd add funds under the Funding tab &gt; USD.  Since we both live in the great state of California, we're able to enjoy overbearing consumer protection laws year-round, which save us from doing business with Kraken and other honest folk.  We should be grateful--or set up an entity in a less caring jurisdiction and trade through that.

routing could happen if we pull the order books from other exchanges and keep balances on those exchanges in order to trade on our customer's behalf and give our them the best price of all exchanges.  It basically creates a pooled order book and if the best deal is at mtgox, we'd need to execute that trade on mtgox.
@_date: 2013-10-16 00:47:26

there is an artificially high demand to buy BTC on MtGox due to the long delays in getting national currencies out of the system.  You might wait months on Gox to get your USD out.  People willing to wait are selling and people not willing to wait are buying BTC and selling it on Bitstamp, driving the price downward there.
Yes, you could arb them but while your USD is sitting on gox, you're missing buying opportunities elsewhere.  So, you can't do it very effectively unless you have a ton of money to float already.

**Free Entry Trial Mode Tournament**
**Register at:**  
**Begin:**  Monday, June 17th 12:00am Pacific (-7:00 GMT)
**End:**  Sunday, June 23rd 11:59pm Pacific
**On the night of Sunday, June 17th we'll:**
* wipe the beta ledger, order book, balances
* credit all accounts with identical balances
* disable the trade API
**Rules &amp; Regs:**
* We ask that you refrain from employing the DDoS strategy.
* You're allowed to create and trade on as many accounts as you want.  New accounts created during the tournament will be credited with the same starter funds.
* You must close out all open positions by the end of the tournament.  Those with remaining open positions will be disqualified.
* Winners determined according to the highest combined USD converted balances.  Only the top 3 accounts are chosen for prizes so having a thousand accounts each with a $10 profit is no better than having one.
* 1st Place - 5 BTC
* 2nd Place - 3 BTC
* 3rd Place - 2 BTC
**Note:**  Bug Bounty still ongoing here:  
If you're not already participating in the beta, feel free to use the weekend to get accustomed to the site.  The beta is still in trial mode and new accounts are automatically funded with play money for you to test with.
Please post questions here.  Good luck!

It will depend on a number of factors but if you have any significant amount of money going in and out of the system, yes, we'll need to collect some personal info.
No, we're not a trading desk.  To make a trade happen, there must be an opposing order from another user.  If you are borrowing margin, it is from the company's own operations fund.

Just as soon as we can do it legally.  It'd be a disservice to our customers to take the risk of something happening like what happened with Gox and their Dwolla/Wells accounts.  Last thing we want is to have your funds seized for operating illegally and not be able to give you your money when you ask for it.  You have to accept a lot of unpredictability when you're operating illegally.

That depends on the definition of a hosted wallet.  The services are substantially different.  If coinbase goes down, your funds go with it.  If blockchain goes down, you can still use your wallet.  Blockchain is more of a web interface for your wallet.  Coinbase is more like a bank you're trusting to secure your funds.

@_date: 2013-05-03 19:29:13
It's something that can be written in an hour and we were waiting to do it because the feature set by launch could have changed.  We'll get to it later today.
Kraken has been in development for about a year and a half with a team of 4 people.  We recently hired 5 more people so the total team is 9 now.  Still hiring more.
The system was built from the ground up with security in mind.  To prevent the catastrophes that we've seen, only simple precautions are required:  sanitize your inputs, don't leave unencrypted cold wallet backups on the server, don't let some cheap ass VPS host your site.  We've spent $150k+ on our own servers, which reside in a private, locked cage, in locked racks, in a top tier data center with armed guards, retina scans, video surveillance, etc.  You can test our forms to see that we've taken the most secure (often user unfriendly) approach possible with regard to the information we return.  Our services are segregated such that a compromise to one piece of the system doesn't get you access to anything particularly useful.
@_date: 2013-10-15 22:50:36
questionable whether this will actually save money when you add in all the extra security costs.  I'd like to hear what Coinbase's plan is for keeping customer data and personal info safe with this remote workforce.  Are you following PCI DSS standards?
@_date: 2013-05-07 23:02:31
all of them except the ones in charge of our account :P
@_date: 2013-06-15 20:18:51
Right, we're attempting to exclude bots but if you can find a way to bot without the API, that's fine.
It means that if you have any open margin trades (positions), you have to close those positions by the time the tournament ends.  Your open positions can be viewed on the positions tab.
@_date: 2013-02-13 04:13:56

@_date: 2013-06-29 05:37:11
Doesn't mean much for Bitcoin as this does not change MtGox's position with the states.  They'll need to get money transmitter licenses in each state in which they have a customer, which is a year and a half process and not guaranteed.  To operate in a state without the necessary money transmitter licenses is a federal crime and it doesn't matter if you registered yourself at the federal level or not.
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:45:55

Yes, I think as soon as we can spare some time or add a few more hands, we'll get on to supporting the other cryptocurrencies with sizable markets.  We'll likely launch with only BTC, add XRP a week or two later, and LTC 1-2 weeks following that.

Our trading guide describes it:  
You might not want to use a regular limit order because you prefer to keep your trade off the books until a later time.  You're basically just creating a rule that will create an order for you later if certain conditions are met.
Market orders buy at the best price that is available, which is unpredictable.  If you set up a Take Profit Limit order, you set 2 prices:  price to trigger the creation of the limit order; price to execute the limit order at.
I took a look at your other trade and you just ran out of funds after buying as much as you could with the funds you had available.  It canceled the rest of your order when you got to 0 EUR.
@_date: 2013-05-15 18:34:27
How do you know he lied?  Afaik, Mutum Siggilum does not operate any type of exchange, and when Mark filled out the form it probably also did not transmit money.  It may still not transmit money at the direction of the customer--it does it at the direction of Tibanne.

there are people on Kraken doing arbitrage with the other exchanges to make money on the price differences.  They might buy low on Bitstamp and sell higher at Kraken.  The prices on Kraken usually track pretty closely to other exchanges because of this arb opportunity.

Thanks, and you're right!  Yes, we do plan to have independent audits both for solvency and security.

@_date: 2013-06-11 07:25:05
Actually, that would be only one reason they're a money transmitter.  Simply allowing users to convert USD&lt;-&gt;BTC is enough to make them a money transmitter.  I imagine they're getting rid of the codes because ripple does it better, and they get a fee out of people trading the coupons around on the ripple network.  They'll still be a money transmitter in the US after this change, and still serving US customers illegally, along with gox and coinbase, until they get their state money transmission licenses.
@_date: 2013-09-27 02:38:18

Kraken opened play money beta in May of 2013, and the team has been around with Ogrr, MaxBTC since 2011.  Real trading opened in early September, and the Fidor Bank deal, which should add a tremendous amount of trust was announced at Money2020, a week and a half ago.

We're working on some better USD deposit/withdraw methods now.  Kraken doesn't take any fees on funding so all fees are coming from the banks on either side of a transfer.  Dwolla isn't an option, and ACH is highly risky but we may touch it in the future as well when we can mitigate that risk.

Unless Coinbase has some secret agency agreement with a money transmitter or bank that they aren't telling us about (and would be required to tell us about), they are indeed in violation of the California MTA whether they think they are or not. While exchanges might have a case, Coinbase is very explicitly a money transmitter--it's their whole business, no different from PayPal.
Coinbase may have misrepresented their software/technology to attorneys in order to get their desired legal opinion. Coinbase may have misrepresented their legal position to investors who failed to do their diligence, or investors may believe that they have sufficient political connections to immunize Coinbase from the selective law enforcement, which, as u/haltingstate pointed out is exactly what Think Computer Corporation is suing over.
Registering with FinCEN as an MSB is a one-time matter of self reporting.  That means that you just tell them what you're doing and then you're on file.  Getting the state by state money transmitter licenses, which Coinbase requires to operate, is a matter of applying in each state you have a customer, being vetted and getting approved, which is a much more lengthy and expensive process.
To answer the OP's question: As far as we know, Coinbase is not compliant. Whether Coinbase's accounts will be seized is up to law enforcement and whoever is responsible for paying them off to look the other way.

Yes, just select the amount of margin you want to use:  1, 2, 5, 10, 250 (beta only).  If you have no margin selected, you'll do a simple exchange.  If you have margin selected, you'll open a position.
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:42:11
To short, you would make a sell order with any amount of margin.  That's basically borrowing the bitcoin at the price you execute the trade(s).  When you close your position, you're making a buy order to purchase those bitcoin you borrowed (ideally, when the price was higher).  So, you borrow (sell) at $100, then you repay (buy) at $90 and you've made $10.
@_date: 2013-05-03 23:16:54
It works fine for me.  Depending on what you're trading, opposing orders and the terms of your closing trade, it may not be able to close immediately.

No, Blockchain cannot run away/shut down and take your coins--that's the whole point, and that's its biggest advantage over the other wallets.
With a shared wallet like Coinbase or Coinjar, you are trusting them completely with your money.  If the cops come and want to confiscate your money, they are able to hand it over.  The advantage is that they've pooled your money with everyone else's and that makes off-chain payments between other users instant.
With a wallet like Blockchain, you aren't trusting them with anything.  You alone hold the private keys.  There isn't anything the FBI can do to get Blockchain to hand over your funds--they don't have the keys.  The disadvantage is that all transactions occur on-chain, which means waiting for the Bitcoin network and confirmations.

Hiya, many apologies for the delayed support.  Indeed, with the Thanksgiving holiday in the US, and the explosive growth we've seen in the last two weeks, we're having a hard time keeping up with the support queue.  Good news is we've just hired 10 new support staff to help out so we should be getting through the backlog pretty quickly.
I would have responded to your PM sooner had I not been moving between continents with limited connectivity, myself (I'm able to access reddit from my phone but not the Kraken admin site).  Alas, reddit is not an official support channel, and I'm not a support agent but I will do my best to help as I'm now finally back on the grid.  In the future, I'd encourage everyone to stick to the official support channel, which is manned by several people and is also more secure.
Your logins have been failing for invalid OTP and invalid password.  You might need to request a two-factor bypass if you've not set this up properly.  Your ip was banned for too many failures, which is why you're getting the 'account temporarily disabled' message--you look like a hacker more than the account owner.
We certainly aren't indifferent to your concerns, and we certainly aren't out to steal anybody's money.  I understand your frustration and I'll do my best to get you back in to your account.  It is late Sunday evening in the States and I will be disappearing for sleep shortly.  If you've got a support ticket in the queue, if you could provide me with that ticket number, I'll follow up with you on that channel.
@_date: 2013-09-11 00:29:26
Coming soon!
@_date: 2013-05-07 23:04:03
Trailing stops have been in from the start.  Time for you to sign up!
@_date: 2013-05-03 07:39:36
Thanks.  Few answers:
* Registration as an MSB is coming in a matter of days.
* Yes, user data is encrypted.
* 100+ and beyond that it's a mystery ;)
* REST API for now.  Email support for details.
* If I told you our DDOS measures, I'd have to kill you.
* BitInstant, bank wire, bitcoin, other currencies soon.
* Yes, some hot, most cold.
* At launch, the limits will be smallish.. $1000 &amp; 10 BTC and we'll raise that cap when we're comfortable with how everything is working.
* African or European?
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:39:35
thanks for the report.
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:23:48
I think Max was talking about Shopify.  Everybody has DDoS protection but nobody knows what that means until it's tested.
@_date: 2013-09-11 00:39:34
you can see the rates across the top of the page, or go to the market data page.
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:36:40
But it's a legit concern.  My co-founder and I came out of retirement to start this business because we believe in Bitcoin.  More money isn't going to change our lives.  I've been very public, attending every conference and meetup I can.  I'm not a difficult person to find.  The bigger concern I think is security, which we go in to some detail about here:   though admittedly, you must take much of that on faith.  Anyway, because we didn't get in to this for money, and because we did get in it to move bitcoin forward, we've taken extreme care with security (and regulatory matters, which we've spent over $1m on).  Hopefully, we'll be able to publish the results of an independent security audit for you very soon.
@_date: 2013-10-21 17:02:42
what was meant by "leading" in the press release?
@_date: 2013-10-21 22:13:59
Sorry, when millions of dollars go missing and customers are left out in the cold, it tends to stick in your memory.  And when those people responsible come back asking to hold customer funds again before their last customers have been made whole, it stings a little.  Can't say you weren't warned.
@_date: 2013-05-03 10:49:10
Yeah, we've gotta improve that error message. Yes, we have a lot more analytical tools, charts and support for existing desktop trading tools planned.  Thanks for the report and I'm glad you like the design!
@_date: 2013-10-21 18:42:07
maybe the leading exchange in overstating significance ;)  What is the bad policy you're speaking of?  Also, that press release you're linking to is on the Fidor site, not the Kraken site, and it's in German.  I don't see any mention of "leading" in the text.
@_date: 2013-05-07 23:11:09
If you figure out what the problem was, please let me know.
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:38:57
offering rebates is one way to do it.  if anybody is interested, please get in touch with me.
@_date: 2013-05-04 21:04:58
Thanks!  I've had this domain for like 10 years.  Was just waiting for a good opportunity to use it :)
@_date: 2013-09-24 00:28:56
Yes, the EUR market is euro denominated.  We don't convert SEPA.  Presently, anything wired in to our Fidor account is converted to EUR.  If it's already EUR it stays EUR.
@_date: 2013-02-13 04:54:12
If you're not interested in currency exchange and you just need a wallet, I'd recommend Blockchain.info over Mt. Gox.  Make sure you set up two-factor authentication.
@_date: 2013-10-22 18:14:41
yeah it is.  We're trying to get some sort of bitcoin themed item/monster created through purchasing a supporter pack from them before the deadline in 23 hours.  They've agreed to take bitcoin for the purchase if we can make it.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:32:26
Actually, the scam was named *after* our exchange.
@_date: 2013-05-12 02:22:44
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:07:43
Thanks!  Great to see so many happy users in this thread.  It really makes us feel good about what we're doing!
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:47:58
For now, you'd have to submit a ticket to support asking us to do it for you.
@_date: 2013-10-22 08:01:20
not yet.
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:10:25
It's on our list.  High priority.
@_date: 2013-09-16 01:04:31
 has advanced stop orders, good api, and margin trading potentially coming back at the end of the month.  If you're in the US, you may not be serviceable, however.
@_date: 2013-05-03 11:45:29
Cool.  We can definitely add a notification on fully executed orders.
Can you take a screenshot of this two option dialog?  When I click on New Order, it takes me directly to the order form.  Orders is for viewing already open/closed orders.  There are some tabs below the order form to view the order book, open orders, positions.
@_date: 2013-05-03 08:56:01
With every state that requires it, yes.
@_date: 2013-10-23 23:18:06
I'll ask Chris to post here but I imagine he's occupied with important launch stuff today.
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:09:07
Thanks for trying to give us your money anyway :P
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:41:40
if you look at the image, you'll see that it appears in Recent Trades, which is trades that have completed, and it does not appear on the Order Book table, which is orders waiting to be filled.
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:13:38


couldn't help myself:  
@_date: 2013-09-09 05:55:59
yes.  despite hardly being able to serve the US due to tight regulatory controls, supporting USD is a top priority.
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:25:46
That's me!  Our office and the team are in San Francisco.  You can usually catch us at the SF and Silicon Valley Bitcoin meetups.  I'll be at the Argentina conference in a few days and the Vegas one right after.
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:33:07
Thanks!  100% agreed.
@_date: 2013-10-08 16:09:17
it was taken before the expo hall opened to get a clear shot.  good thing because it was totally packed after.
@_date: 2013-05-03 23:56:29
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  I wish they did too!
@_date: 2013-05-03 08:13:01
Excellent question.  Email, Reddit, Bitcointalk, Twitter and Facebook:
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:31:35
yup, and his wish was granted.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:59:27
Right.. ultimately, the problem is finding banking partners who support these currencies who are willing to take on Bitcoin businesses.  It's rough out there but we're making headway.  I think after the relatively positive US Senate hearings, we may start having better luck.
@_date: 2013-10-21 18:23:13
Someone could be manipulating the price for stop hunting but it wouldn't be Kraken.  Without some constant, ongoing audit by an independent 3rd party, I don't know how you could have total certainty.  Yes, you'd have to take it on faith that Kraken is not interacting with the market, though it's stated on the site. 
@_date: 2013-09-09 05:41:38
Thanks!  If you get to tier2 and you're in a jurisdiction we can serve, you'll be able to deposit/withdraw EUR.
@_date: 2013-09-11 06:36:08
Thanks!  What do you mean how?
@_date: 2013-05-03 10:17:57
that's the best time to buy!  hold on to it for a few days and I'm sure you'll have a nice 25% return.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:38:36
We've definitely got some improvement to do on support, and it's already underway with a big batch of new service agents in training now.  We were a bit blindsided by the explosion of growth in the last 2 weeks.
About the phone number, we're not confirming it at this time.  It's more for our own reference in case we need to contact you in an emergency, or if your email and account become compromised.  Actually confirming it is something we'll be adding soon.
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:30:52
If you just want a unified wallet for storage of digital currencies, there are several options among the exchanges, like [Kraken](
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:18:52
Specifically, no state requires it at this time.  But, you are free to spend $100k+ on your own attorneys and get a second opinion.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:42:48
It's kind of ridiculous, isn't it?  The problem we have is that California wants to protect its residents (largely from competitors of the folks who wrote the law).  California doesn't care what California businesses do to non-California customers.  So, until we have our licenses in place in CA, we won't be able to service CA customers, unfortunately.  For the time being, you are able to at least trade in the digital currency pairs.
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:53:28
yeah, I'm highly skeptical of any exchange that pops out of nowhere and within the same month has 10k btc volume per day.  Very likely the volume is being faked, which is trivial to do.
@_date: 2013-09-11 18:42:11
The trade fees may increase later but there is no set date to increase the fees right now.
@_date: 2013-10-16 00:45:59
securing one server is easier than securing all your remote workers' systems, which are used for who knows what outside of work hours.  In an office, you can control how your employees handle information, you can make them check their phones/cameras at the door, you can watch what they're doing, you can make sure they're following procedures, you can lock down their systems, etc.
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:09:52
We only have 3 banks available at the moment--one in the US for USD, one in Germany for EUR, and one in Korea for KRW.  We're working on finding more local banking partners around the world to help facilitate cheaper and faster deposits and withdrawals for users everywhere.  Out of curiosity, where do you live?
@_date: 2013-05-03 07:29:27
Banking relationship is good but that doesn't mean the bank can't suddenly decide that they want to stop working with us for any or no reason.  In fact, one other potential banking partner pulled out after 2 months of talks.  Fortunately, we were pursuing multiple deals at once.  They have said that we would have time to wind down the account and it wouldn't be without warning.  I don't see the Bitfloor thing repeating with us but sure, you should be concerned any time you give over your money to someone.
Regarding licensing, we're making all the progress we feel necessary.  We have a few excellent advisors, investors, and a full-time staff attorney (general counsel) who left her job at a top 10 firm to handle this stuff.
We will not route trades at launch but it is something the exchange is capable of doing.  Our biggest problem with routing to gox is that they're horribly unreliable.  Our second biggest problem is that our competitor has strong incentive to lock our funds up.  Currently, BTC/USD is simulated against the gox order book (unless a better rate exists within Kraken).  If you want to test out pure Kraken, use XRP pairs.
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:08:17
We're amid the greatest transfer of wealth in history and the United States is not part of that flow.  The inability for US users to buy, sell and trade bitcoin legally ought to be seen as an urgent matter of national security.
Immediate action is needed at the federal level to, at least temporarily: 1. exempt bitcoin exchangers from state money transmission laws; 2. exempt banks from liability surrounding their bitcoin business customers.
The United States does not have a year to wait and see if any domestic business can manage to get licensed as a money transmitter in every state.  There are businesses able and willing to obey the rules, combat money laundering and protect consumer interests (See Digital Asset Transfer Authority SRO initiative) but they don't have the licenses do to it legally, and they don't have the banks willing to back them.
Banks need clear guidance and encouragement to take bitcoin business, and bitcoin businesses need to know that they're not risking prison time by operating before they have their licenses in every state.
@_date: 2013-06-29 08:34:14
No, there is no grace period.  You're required to have the licenses prior to operating even for a single day, even for a single dollar.
@_date: 2013-09-09 05:42:25
Thanks for the report.  We're aware of some problems with the Tier 3 form and working on the support system now.
@_date: 2013-05-11 20:50:51
ya, this is like 2004-2005?  probably around $12k.
@_date: 2013-05-03 10:12:44
Yeah, I guess we'll see if anyone actually uses HOTP and if not, maybe we'll remove it as an option.  You're probably right that support requests/confusion alone will be enough to justify the removal.
That's a great idea for a feature that I'd love to have, myself.  I'll put it on our to-do list.
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:06:31
Thanks!  Please let us know if you have any feedback, constructive criticism.
@_date: 2013-10-20 09:18:45
maybe leading in the sense that it's the only legally operating exchange?
@_date: 2013-10-22 00:42:42
Probably about as safe as any bank account, minus the insurance.  That is to say if the feds want to seize your funds, they can do it.  If they're on your encrypted laptop drive, they'd have a harder time.  If coinbase loses your funds, they'd likely replace them to avoid reputational damage, to the extent that they're able.
@_date: 2013-09-29 09:17:04
Cashier's checks are easily faked/double spent.  Be careful with that.
@_date: 2013-05-03 23:24:15
Blue.. No, yellow!
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:28:24
Thanks, Mqrius!  I hope the guys running Ogrr make something of it.  I'm just thinking now about the 1000 BTC we gave away to the first 1000 users!
@_date: 2013-05-12 05:49:53
First, thanks for the interest in the service and support.  We're doing our best.
By 'chill out' I meant relax, and I meant it in the nicest way possible.  I appreciate the armchair lawyering and Internet policing, trying to save people from being scammed but how about a trial before the execution?  I don't see anything in the OP about security.  If OP were a concerned supporter, I think a less alarming title would have sufficed.  We certainly appreciate those who are taking the time to test the service out and we want to address our users' and prospective users' concerns.
If OP's analysis is that a bitcoin exchange ought to be a registered money transmitter in California, no bitcoin exchange is in compliance with the law.  Not a single bitcoin exchange is registered as a money transmitter in California, despite having customers in California.  Gox, BitStamp, Coinbase (just raised $5m from high profile VCs) are all in violation of the law.  Do you not trust them?
Yes, the terms are filler, as is much of the site's content.  We're working through it.  We have a full-time rockstar attorney on our staff.  Rest assured that by the time we ask you for more than an email address, we'll have the proper docs in place.
@_date: 2013-05-03 07:42:32
Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:58:37
GBP pairs coming very soon!  Hang tight.
@_date: 2013-05-03 07:42:10
good idea.  It's actually been in private beta for over a month now with a few hundred users but please do report bugs to beta-support
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:23:12
I've filled in about 100 comments on this thread to make up for it ;)
The security measures are in place.  That isn't something we were willing to launch without.
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:17:16
Probably not.  It's complicated legally.  We're exploring some other options for lendable reserves right now.
@_date: 2013-05-07 08:08:55
Thank you for dinner!  Great event!
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:24:21
blockchain and coinbase are very different.  Blockchain doesn't control the private keys, coinbase does.
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:41:49
Yes.  This is something we're strongly considering.
@_date: 2013-10-21 17:07:34
margin trading isn't available yet due to low liquidity.  Kraken isn't a trading desk and it never takes a position on the market.
@_date: 2013-09-11 18:42:23
awesome!  good work!
@_date: 2013-09-09 20:45:55
Thanks!  Yeah, hit the nail on the head.  We're working on being able to offer more reserve currencies but that doesn't necessarily come with more serviceable jurisdictions.
@_date: 2013-06-05 20:40:26
No.  See: 
@_date: 2013-09-09 06:32:26
Unfortunately, that is not us _yet_.  You might try  on freenode.
@_date: 2013-06-05 20:10:03
I think conservatively, 1 month but it could be much sooner.  I hesitate to give time estimates where completely out of our control.
@_date: 2013-05-03 11:47:03
She bought in to Bitcoin at $3 so she's got some incentive to make this work.  The firm she left is Kirkland &amp; Ellis.
@_date: 2013-09-26 19:49:02
yes, for now just bank wire.  Maybe ACH and cash deposit eventually.
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:46:01
coming soon.. will be competitive with gox.
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:55:11
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-05-03 10:23:51
Yes, that includes short selling.
@_date: 2013-09-24 00:24:52
Thanks for the tip.  We're talking to a few people/firms who are interested in market making right now.  If anybody here is interested in such an opportunity, please get in touch.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:39:36
right.  We don't send a verification text at this time but it's something we have planned.
@_date: 2013-05-03 08:34:02
Maybe it's a clue to unlocking the secret of 0 fees on your account.  Feel free to not send us any money until that placeholder text is removed. :)
@_date: 2013-06-06 01:28:24
I know.. bizarre notion.  Unfortunately, it should be an obvious necessity to everyone in the space at this point.
@_date: 2013-10-22 00:28:54
You can review the javascript on the page.  They store an encrypted wallet file for you, which you can also store yourself and use elsewhere, if you want.  The wallet is encrypted and decrypted in your browser client, on your computer only, and never on the server.  So, Blockchain never has access to more than the encrypted wallet file, which they can't decrypt without you.
@_date: 2013-05-06 09:03:50
Thanks!  In hindsight, I probably should have sold it to you and bought more Bitcoin &gt;.&lt;
@_date: 2013-05-03 23:26:16
Definitely.  We now have a full-time staff attorney and over the last 2 years we've spent a lot of time and money on this.  We're being very cautious here and we want to do everything according to the law.
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:16:33
My educated guess is within 2 months.
@_date: 2013-09-09 20:44:03
Yup!  The services offered vary by state and we're working hard on being able to expand those services.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:18:00
That's me :)
We recently spun Ogrr off in to its own company and that is now being developed by a separate team.  Also, we run the mining pool maxbtc.com
Me and 8 other people at this point.  Been in development for over a year and a half.
@_date: 2013-05-03 23:56:05
Thanks!  I hope so too.  It's definitely a huge concern for us so it's gotten a lot of attention.
@_date: 2013-10-14 19:55:53
Thanks, Stephen.  To confirm, Kraken does not pay interest on deposits.  In fact, I'd discourage you from keeping more funds on the exchange than you actually want to actively trade with--unless you really think it's more likely that you'll lose your coins than it is that we'll have them lost, stolen, seized.
@_date: 2013-05-15 05:11:50
just ate here and paid in bitcoin.  another group of guys came in while we were eating who also wanted to pay in bitcoin.  Awesome!  Great food, btw.
@_date: 2013-09-26 01:50:30
I remember, which is why Kraken will not work with them.  Dwolla stabbed the back it was built on.
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:06:25
Hm.. I think we can send a USD check anywhere in the world but I'm not sure how long it'd take your bank to process that.  EUR wires can be sent anywhere but if your Canadian bank account can't hold euros, your bank would probably convert the euros to CAD upon receipt.  We wouldn't do the conversion on our end--we'd just send EUR.
@_date: 2013-10-14 22:38:20
unfortunately, the easier the entrance, the more likely the exchange is not operating legally.  I don't know that anyone has compiled the data you're looking for, but a start is here:    Things like funding times will vary depending upon deposit methods.  For [Kraken]( SEPA and wires are usually next business day.
@_date: 2013-05-03 10:37:13
Yeah, it's about time I got to bed so this will probably be my last response for the next ~8 hours.
I know that many of the alt coins are getting a lot of hype these days.  If it's worthwhile, we'll support it.  If the market is small but the altcoin offers something especially compelling and we think it has a lot of potential, we may support it anyway.  To some extent, creating a marketplace for something adds value to it and I'd like to avoid detracting too much attention from the currencies that I really do think offer something special.
I don't know anything about PPCoin.. so far we've only discussed XRP, LTC and NMC but I'll check it out.  Thanks again :)
@_date: 2013-09-15 06:15:24
40% turnout in the primary produced the below results.  Based on this debate, I don't see Elizabeth holding on to that top spot.
Elizabeth T. Ploshay (30.0%)
Trace Mayer (17.1%)
Ben Davenport (16.8%)
Joerg Platzer (16.8%)
Luke Dashjr (7.1%)
@_date: 2013-10-22 18:16:27
they've agreed to take bitcoin for our combined effort at the big supporter pack.  help us out!
@_date: 2013-05-03 10:25:21
pretty long question and I'm falling asleep at the wheel here so let me get back to you.  we'll definitely make much more info available before we ask you to trust us with any real money.  Also, you can meet most of the team at the conference in San Jose.
@_date: 2013-05-03 23:31:31
Sorry, I was joking with you.  It's just the latin lorem ipsum filler.
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:48:17
You would short by selecting any amount of margin and making a sell order.
@_date: 2013-06-11 10:24:01
Actually, coinbase _is_ a money transmitter, whether they claim to not be in their terms or not.  I'd love to hear your analysis as to why you think they're not though.  Maybe I'm missing something but exchanging BTC for USD, controlling pooled user funds, transferring user funds at their direction between users and to other locations and parties external to the service would constitute money transmission.  There is no question after the guidance that was issued.
@_date: 2013-10-30 00:08:47
ha no way!  I'll see if anyone got some shots of the carving in action.
@_date: 2013-05-03 08:23:51
I would have you direct that question at mtgox whose BTC/USD feed we're pulling to simulate trades against during beta.  Obviously, it's something we need to work out if we're going to route trades to them in the future.  Possibly a problem with propagation, possibly a problem with the code that tries to get rid of the negative spreads.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:23:13
correct.  no plans to support LTC at the moment or any other Bitcoin-based currencies.
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:30:26
I did tell you what makes it different.  Yes, you can short.  Also, if you're waiting for an exchange to accept credit cards or paypal, you're going to be waiting a long time.

Only the top 3 accounts will receive prizes.  Sorry if that wasn't clear.  I'll update the post.

Has everybody forgotten that Amir Taaki screwed his customers over when he was at Bitcoinica, and he's still got a lawsuit over that pending against him in California?  Amir cost people millions of dollars and now he's asking you trust him with your money once again?  Unbelievable.

What you have to do is simply have the highest combined USD converted balance at the end of the week.

Acquiring the necessary licenses will take at least a year and a half.  Also, the penalty for operating illegally is $5000/day.  I suppose 1/2 of their $5m they just raised will go toward paying those penalties, if they manage to stay out of prison that long.

I hate to bring this up because Zhou Tong may be totally innocent, but, the last Bitcoin venture he was involved with, Bitcoinica, lost millions of dollars of customer funds over 3 different hacks, which to this day have not been returned.

Yeah, expect 48 hours, or 2 business days for USD wires.  It depends on your bank's wire cutoff time, how quickly they send wires out, and our bank's ability to receive the wire and post it to our account.  It's not nearly as efficient a system as SEPA but it's all we've got at the moment.
