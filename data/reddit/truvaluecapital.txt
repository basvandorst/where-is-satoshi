Agreed.  I have been buying over the last 2 years to prepare for this halving.  I believe the effect is totally underestimated.  Just after halving in 2012 you can see massive price rise long before Cyprus.  Supply of new Bitcoins will be cut by 50%!  That means millions more a day staying in Bitcoin if demand is same as now.  This can create positive feedback loop and drive price even higher probably past ATH by the fall.

Too many things coming down the pipeline.  I don't want to try and hype up Bitcoin but the price will likely go back into another mega bubble as we scale over the next year.  $4000 a coin can very easily happen.  After the halving in 2012 Bitcoin did a 52x in 2013.  Most of that was momentum built up from the price halving.  If you go back and look at the charts the upward price pressure started fairly heavily about a month after halving in Jan. 2013.  The Cyprus banking crisis was not until March, so the halving mostly made BTC rising dramatically in price that year.  I would expect about a 10x from these levels through 2017.

Agreed.  Even now its easy to spend Bitcoin everywhere with my new Shift Debit Card I don't want to!  What's nice about a currency that's gaining value compared to all other government currencies losing major value (in the long run) is that I can make a major purchase if choose too.  Bitcoin encourages me to save like never before and by saving money now I am able to spend money later.  With fiat you just want to get rid of it ASAP b/c its losing value.  While this encourages spending now its toxic later b/c people have no savings when times get lean, leading to one financial crisis after another.  The real problem is not spending money its that people don't save!  In Bitcoin you will want to save now and spend later!  This leads to a stable longterm growth economy.  Central Bank policies around the world are fundamentally flawed.

IMO its exponential growth.  If you have been with Bitcoin for a while you know how much easier it is to use than it was before.  This means more users and more transactions with inter translates to higher BTC prices.  2016 will be Bitcoin's best year yet and I don't believe we have even started pricing in the halving which is coming up in approx. 7 months from now.
@_date: 2015-12-05 17:04:37

One of the best ratios to look at it debt to total American GDP.  It was much higher in WWII.  I think these doomsday people are overblowning it.  The Fed will con't to devalue the dollar - Its a very slow death holding cash.  Although the Feds policies are flawed it does mean another Global meltdown like we saw in 08'.  If anything inflation will start to ramp up from all that newly minted money on the banks balances sheets being loan out into circulation.  Bitcoin IMO solves the Store of Value Problem which we know in any given year approx. how many coins in circulation.  In theory, when Bitcoin becomes widely adopted we will not need the Feds to control monetary policy.  People ask me all the time why would the Feds allow it.  Let me ask when is Ukraine biggest bank allowing it?  I will tell you Bitcoin is very likely to succeed b/c the currency is neutral.  Meaning no Government or single group controls it.  This means no body can shut it down and from the regulators point of view its out there jurisdiction.  Moreover, Bitcoin being a neutral currency makes it's use cases Global in scale.  The only people I heard really against Bitcoin was Jamie D. from Chase Bank.  Besides the fact that a lot of people still think Bitcoin is used for drugs and terrorist - The real fact is once people (including Governments) see how Bitcoin is used they start embracing it.  That's why its very important to keep Bitcoin decentralize but respect regulators wishes as much as possible.  We don't want to get on the wrong side of the Governments.  Bitcoin needs to be the neutral currency any Government should embrace to have a way out of crisis situations.

 is free with bank transfer and they have cheaper market price than Coinbase.  Just be aware Uphold bank verification took me a week to process and another week for the funds to transfer in to buy BTC.  If you are worried about Bitcoin price jump up before you can do it  would be faster although they charge the 1% fee.  I bought a lot of Bitcoins off of coinbase since the bubble of 2013 and they make it very easy!  Personally I think its good to set-up multiple accounts with at least two companies.

Agreed.  I bought my first coin at $1000 two years ago and have been steadily buying ever sense.  My cost average is now positive at $340.  Many times this year I was beating the S&amp;P's 500's return over that same two year period with Bitcoin.  If it works out like it may those coins could become worth a lot of money over a 10 year period of time.  I look at Bitcoin the same way you do.  A longterm savings account and don't invest more than about 20% of my net worth.  If I would have went all in - even at $500 a coin I would not be positive ROI now.  Cost avg. is the smartest way to do this.  There's no reason to debate the Bitcoin network its not growing steadily and if it continues the price must go higher and higher over a period of time.

These bank chains don't allow for innovation the way Bitcoin does.  Bitcoin will scale in 2016 and soon enough we will have instant transactions.  I think its a lot like Netflix was to Blockbuster.  The banks have tons of overhead, so there's no way in five years they will able to complete with Bitcoin, which is basically free to use.  Also, these private blockchains do not solve the store of value problem.

The Governments declaring Bitcoin illegal and going in to shut down the exchanges would be horrible for Bitcoin.  So far we have not seen them do it.  Even Russia I believe has exchanges, which they said many times they were going to ban it.  I think we have yet to see the big fight the bigger Bitcoin grows.  One really great thing Bitcoin has going for it, is the fact that no country owns it or controls it.  Think about those centralized systems, you'd have an impossible time getting China to accept Fed Coins.  If think about BTC it really the World's first global currency - the reason b/c its a neutral currency.

I believe that's the beauty of Bitcoin is that we know its going to happen and when.  The Fed you just never know how much more money they are going to print or for how long they will keep the interest rates ultra low, possibly creating another bubble after bubble for God knows how long!  In Bitcoin there's a Free Market working so supply and demand can meet in efficient manners.

Look at the way Circle and Uphold works.  Users can choose which currency they want to hold "cloud banking" then send it to a BTC address free.  This way of banking is superior over the current system which is extremely slow and burdened with high fees to operation.  I like to think of Bitcoin as Netflix is to Blockbuster.  Sure movie rental places still exist but over time there's less and less and eventually all movies will be digital.  I believe the same will happen with the banks.  Also, I think there will be improvements made to the existing payment systems but b/c Bitcoin is open and available to everyone it will become this great value exchange protocol.  Look at how many more transactions are happening in Bitcoin every year over its brief seven year history.  Especially recently it looking more like exponential growth.

I think a deal in Greece will come through at the last minute as it really makes much more sense for the them to stay in the EURO.  Its def not good news for Greece nor the EURO. At the for the Store of Value case the EURO not looking so good!  I am long Bitcoin and Eastern Europe - Spain and Greece but in a Bitcoin economy we would not have these problems in the first place.  I don't believe in elastic money supply (money printing) I think the free market handles the up's and downs much more efficiently than any group of central planners.

I believe these side chains are pegged to Bitcoin's blockchain so you'll still have the same security as Bitcoin.  One of the issues raising the blocksize limit is it creates more centralization of nodes and that of mining slower to download the 21MB.  I am no expert in this field but it seems like what Blockstream is doing may come too late before Bitcoin hits the 1MB limit.  I do think the Blocksize needs to be lifted higher but I am concerned about the centralization of Bitcoin if we con't to increase Blocksize.  Wishful thinking... the next time we have raise the limit hopefully these Blockstream sides chains will be tested tried and trued for at least a few years before we go putting our Bitcoin there!  I am with you!

Bitcoin in its current state could not handle the transactional volume for mass adoption.  However, there's many developers working on this issue as we speak and Bitcoin should be ready to handle 100x the transactions with the lightening network and segregated witness.

Get ready for a wild 2016!

The real reason the Fed likes money printing and having 100% control over money supply is the government can spend and go to war as much as it like.  They pass the inflation "hidden tax" to the people so they can get their debts inflated away instead of paid away.

Yeah, and its just like this TICP Internet compared to Prod.  So many APPS are choosing Bitcoin not some alt coin or E-Pesa.  Bitcoin is the real deal and very soon the big boys will finally agree to take this very seriously!  Its already happening!  There's just a few more things that need to happen before Bitcoin takes off.  First and foremost is the volatility of Bitcoin does not for a regular person use.  Yeah its going more and more stable but this problem want be solved until the market cap gets higher with time.  We must have the USD Wallets but be able to send out in BTC just like email!!!  There is Circle coming out with it's Beta very soon and you have Bitreserve, which will solve this very problem but you then got to give the masses 1 year more before they jump on.

So what's the USD backed by?  Faith.  You cannot redeem your dollars for anything.  You can pay your taxes with it.  Its an IOU from the government.  Bitcoin has value b/c the network says its worth something.  The more widely traded and accepted the more stable the more entrenched it becomes.  On a longterm trend it gaining stability by its network effect.  Only a matter a time before the mainstream sees it as an alt currency completely resistant to control and malnipulation.

Yet this perceived 'safe' asset Realestate is not so safe when the Feds are always on the gas pedal pumping huge asset bubbles b/c the economy so weak and there's nothing but debt.  If people have 'real' money that's not being debased and the governments started balancing budgets and paying down debt you'd see a huge improvement in confidence and savings.  Contrary to popular Game Theory Economics - when people save more they spend more.  When the value of their money is going up over long periods they have more wealth to spend.  It's ridicules to think money printing and inflation will solve the problems.  That is the problem!

No reason to make there own coin and new blockchain from 0.  In the end it will all be tied to the Bitcoin Blockchain anyway.  Same as the Intranets vs. Internets today.  The Blockchain (Bitcoin's) is the financial link which all apps will be built on top of.  Just a matter of time before all the banks see it this way.  You'll have lots of coins running on side chains linked into Bitcoin to make the transfer.  You can see this coming with Blockstream's Liquid and Rootstock.  Side chains will be big deal pegged to Bitcoin size, scale and security.

THis is still the beginning innings of this ballgame.  Early Adapters were 1st inning but also took the most risk as Bitcoin was still unproven/unknown.  THis is Only inning 2 or 3 and we have a long ways of upside ahead.  Its becoming very clear many assets will transfer over the Bitcoin's Blockchain over the coming years.

And the miners would run away with Visa?  Why would they?  All the value is in Bitcoin the tokens that runs the Blockchain.  Let's assume for a moment visa decided to make there on blockchain and give it value say Bitcoin market cap 6 Billion and 21 million coins ever what to say they could not change the rules as the go?  They control it from the beginning why would the miners jump over on Visa's Blockchain when it has not been proven.  Why would Visa even waste Billions of dollars making there own when you can use Bitcoin's for Free?  Let's say visa pull off the closed Blockchain (aka shared database) what's to make all the massive innovation go on theirs?  Visa would never allow open applications to be built on top of it.  So what you are really saying is Visa will create their own Intranet of money when Bitcoin is the Internet of money.  The same will happen to "private blockchains" as what happened to the Intranets.  Sure you'll have Intranets - PB future translation Side Chains but they will be linked to The Blockchain which is Bitcoin to ultimately settle the transactions.

The cheaper coins allowed me to cost avg. in with a better price so you will not hear me complaining about the price drop, as I was already paying $1000 a coin last year and was even ready to buy more at those prices if had not come back down.  At $230 its a good deal if this is used to transfer much of the world's value.  Miners got to have this currency to verify so IMO if Blockchain is successful so will be Bitcoin the currency.  I think we are in for a long way up.  We are not the early adaptors but we are still in early enough in this game to have massive gains.  Even the ones that come later... even you if bought BTC at future $10,000 a coin there's an upside!  You see the Network's of money are so great once Bitcoin is entrenched into our everyday lives its almost impossible to remove it.  Just Look how hard it is to get people to stop using Visa, MC, AMEX even with there high fees and ancient 1950's tech.  Bitcoin if successful will be around for a long time and over the years could grow to the trillion market cap range.  We are talking over a lifetime.  Not next year or in 20 but 60 years or more this could be the world's reserve currency or at least of the reserve currency of the Internet!  Internet of things could make it into the trillions as machines pay each other in BTC 20-30 years from now.

Side Chains will solve much of Bitcoin's scalability problems.  Essentially, it would be very similar to alt coins where they would have their own set of rules but be pegged to the blockchain.   You could even have USD Coins pegged to the blockchain, sending to any bitcoin address.  There's little need for alt coins when we have side chains that will serve the same purpose.  The problem with alt coins is the network effects ---- how do scale them?  With Bitcoin is already been scaled and over 3 billion is riding on top of it.  Why would you not build on top of Bitcoin's blockchain vs Alts that have many liquidity problems and chains that have low protection from attacks?  I am just curious how you think an Alt coin could replace Bitcoin at this point?  or complete with it.  Next in line is Litecoin but its a peanut and Only getting smaller in scale.  Bitcoin continues to be more widely used every day.  Please explain.

There's money to be made with Bitcoin based companies.  Coinbase is making the case for it and so are others.  It may not be wildly profitable like the banks were back in the day but with Bitcoin its like VOIP and Skype.  Profits are much smaller but in scale cost much lower!

Never.  21 million Bitcoins ever.  This is a core principal of Bitcoin.  If they ever change it I along with the other 4.9 million users of Bitcoin will dump it!  Never ever!  Bitcoin should deflate over a long period of time.  Store of Value!  That's why most of us are here for.
@_date: 2015-06-22 02:31:29
How do we get that to happen - the 1%.  I like this idea.  20% is still way too much for any organization to be in control of.  This super power masking it by splitting into several pools is very scary!  I kind of agree with Andreas here though.  These miners have it there best interest not to create a double spending attach as the value of what they are mining far out weighs the benefits of trying to double spend.  Only if a financial organization or gov't who do not like Bitcoin would do a double spend attach.  The miners want BTC price to stay as high as possible!  Even if they could gain 51% control I am not sure they would do a double spend attack b/c then the value of what they are mining would be worthless or at the very least worth a lot less as investors dump BTC!

@_date: 2015-06-21 16:30:30
Hopefully, it goes up slowly - creeps up is even better!  If we get another huge spike up followed by a huge spike down this is not good for Bitcoin's longterm success.  Volatility needs to keep steadily decreasing along with the price steadily increasing on a long term basis.  If we can get this 5 years from now we could see Bitcoin as a real proven long term store of value looked highly upon by fund managers.

Bitcoin is far more efficent than the current financial system.  The point mentioned above was:
It's extremely productive; Mining has created a level of security that no robber, no hacker, no corporation, and possibly no government on the planet can overcome. If that still doesn't impress you, then imagine how much energy, money, and manpower (and how many industries exist to support) the existing financial system. Think about every bank branch, every armored van, every security guard, every wire service, etc... 
Compared to paper money Bitcoin's mining a very small price to pay for its security.

Congrats!  Welcome to the club!  I just keep buying and finally at 50BTC.  BTW I started buying at $1000 1 and half ago.  Got some at $1000, got some more at $600, more at $400 and even more at $220.  My cost average is in the upper 300's.  If I am lucky maybe I'll add a few more if the price goes back to $200 but I would rather see the prices start moving up from here.  If this is going to work will must see higher prices by next year's halving.  IMO $2000 a coin will come very fast with a year or two.  GLTA.

Its a no brainer more and more people are going to have Bitcoin.  The ability to send receive money instantly for almost Free is the key driver along with Bitcoin's Long Term Store of Value Properties.  Every time the price goes up it creates another wave of adopters, which intern fuels the miners to upgrade high computer powers, leading to an even more secure Value Transfer System we call the Blockchain.  The Networking effects are so great I believe it is a winner take all scenario.  Not to say some alts will not gain traction and be prosperous but I don't think they'll ever reach the scale that Bitcoin will have.  Sidechains (pegged to Bitcoin's Blockchain Security) IMO would be the answer to many Apps needing to run their on special software. What would a Billion user Bitcoin economy look like?  This is going to be very interesting over the next 10 years no doubt.

$10,000 a coin would be incredible and a lot of us on here would be Bitcoin Millionaires but seriously if it goes to 10K a coin what's stopping it from scaling to at least $40,000 or beyond?  Best case perfect scenario would be 1 million a coin and that would be it in the trillions of market cap like gold.  If this was to happen it would take at least 20 years to hit a 1 million coin.  Realistically, we should expect $10,000 in 2-3 years.  Pessimistically, in 2-3 years if Bitcoin has not gained acceptance by the mainstream it may go under $100 a coin and eventually to 0 if only a small group of libertarians give up on it.

It's very very difficult to bring a new user in when the media has blasted it over and over again for illicit activity. They always focus on the negatives - GOX, Silk Road, ECT. The best way is to show them how it works and talk about how the Internet was in its early days.  There was so much negative press about the Internet in 95".  I remember it's for porn and terrorism.  Slowing I think the perception on Bitcoin is changing.
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:15:46
Apple Pay does not solve the store of value problem.  Merchants still need to set-up credit card accounts and pay the 3% transaction fees (6% international).  Apple Pay is your credit card in your phone and can easily be fraud.  Maybe its more convenient than carry all those cards but really that's not the problem.  THe problem is Apple Pay uses the Visa, MC and AMEX networks that are so and expensive.  Bitcoin network (Blockchain) does it faster, cheaper and 100% secure.

Over the longterm it does become more stable.  Its still to early in Bitcoin's history for it to trade within a 10% range all year.  I think 10 years from now it will become very stable and will likely become more stable than Gold.  Bitcoin is a rail will first see other assets being transfered via colored colors and such.  The speculators will continue to speculate so I would not call it stable until we reach a 40 Billion market cap.  Now we are a very small Nasdaq company and I would not call them stable.

When you go Bitcoin wallet to Bitcoin wallet in closed loop is when the magic really happens.  We are getting there.  Having the debit cards is going in the right direction so now you can literally living off of BTC.  The network effects of money are nearly exponential when you having something that is cross board Peer-to-Peer.  I believe now Bitcoin has like 5 million active users but when it gets really interesting is when we hit the 10 of millions.  All it would take is the price going up the ATH to set this next phase of user adaption.  It's starting to happen.

Huge!  I been saying since I bought my first Bitcoin two years ago that remittances with Bitcoin is key for disruption.  Bitcoin is going to be used in so many Apps to make the transfer of value happen.  People should start thinking as Bitcoins the tokens that make value transfer happen.  I think later on BTC the currency will be huge but only when it matures enough.  When you go BTC to BTC wallet then you will have finally unleashed Bitcoins true potential.  This Visa move is a very big deal.  The remit markets are sending over 600 billion a year.  The last time I checked BTC had a market cap at 5-6 Billion.  Start doing the math and even if its to buy and sell BTC on the backend its still a really big deal when you get a lot users.

It will not be easy for Litecoin to grow into a 3+ Billion market cap any time soon.  What's litecoin going to do that Bitcoin can't do with the side chains?  IMO its mostly a winner take all.  Sorry I am in Winklevoss camp here.

Bitcoin does so much more than what the "private blockchains" can and will do.  Whatever you can do on a private blockchain you can do it on Bitcoin's without permission and with no fees.  You can send USD or whatever the hell you want it to be in value.  Right now the Bitcoin Blockchain is a million times better than the banks.  People who bash Bitcoin have not used it yet nor understand it but one by one (very similar to Uber, Facebook and whatever other big technology idea) they come.  Bitcoin is growing by leaps and bounds; when its a transfer of value open Internet protocol is Huge bigger than FB, Twitter, Uber.  Start thinking Internet size big.  Bitcoin is in fact just that the Internet of Value.

Get ready for a hell ride.  If the prices heads where I am thinking we will see it get really crazy.  Lots of fundamentals now starting to drive BTC price surge.  I probably sound a little to bullish but I think $1200 a coin will be low for next year.  I think we are heading very volatiley to at least $2500 next year!  In five years at a much bigger market cap the prices will start smoothing out.  Let's see its very interesting to see Bitcoin volumes at ATH.  The trend is your friend and the trend says buy and hold for much higher prices later!

Same could be said about Venmo in US.  Again, its not cutting across boarders and it will not link to other payment services and its biggest draw back is its reversible and uses the old ACH transfer to make it happen.  A person could simple stop payment in the three days it takes to get from you bank account.  Another huge downfall is a lot people in the world don't have bank accounts and the don't accept pounds.  In Bitcoin it can be the medium of exchange and a currency of longterm value.  Even the reserve currency of the world USD lost 95% of its value since a 100 years ago.  Its a long slow death with fiat money and that's one thing Ping It could never solve.

When the time comes they will come to agreement to increase block size.  "If its not broke don't fix it" when dealing with money most people are always going to be ultra conservative.  Bitcoin will evolve as we go so stop worrying.  Bitcoin does some much more than the traditional banking system that we are light years ahead.  The community is aware of the problem but currently the size limits are handling the volume.  In the future, without any doubt a solution will be presented and the Bitcoin Protocol evolves.  Nice steady growth is what we want to con't to see.

Circle.com does instant buy with debit cards Free up to $300 I believe.  Also, Uphold.com is live now for US and Europe CC and bank transfers.  Uphold is the Shit IMO.

Uphold has got a great BTC exchange rate and again its completely Free.

Blockstream is developing the right tools to handle the upcoming volume.  The sidechains IMO are the way to go.  Now the question is will they be developed and tested far enough to start getting some of the volume off Blockchain and on to them before we breach 1MB?  To keep Bitcoin as decentralized as possible we must be careful with the Block size.  I am no expert in this matter and trust the community on this but the point of Bitcoin is decentralization!

Bitcoin needs a PR badly.  There needs to be an open crowdfunding campaign for Bitcoin.  Imagine what some good marketing would do for Bitcoin.  The good news is as the companies building on top of Bitcoin get bigger they will be able to sponser some really great marketing!  Bitpay already attempted that but didn't resign for next year.  Bitcoin is a protocol not a company so if people find it useful (like TICP early Internet) then the companies built on top of it grow!

Next summer only 12.5 BTC will be mined, instead of the current 25 BTC every ten minutes.  All other things being equal the price should rise b/c there's less new Bitcoin's hitting the market.  So when you do the math it takes $878,400 (current mrk price) a day just to keep Bitcoin the same price.  Next year if all other things equal would take only $439,200 a day a to keep even with BTC inflation.

BTW its already working with no complaints for 6 months now.  The Only thing I heard from a few buyers was "Your website made me paying a tax at checkout".  No one out of many has made any big deal about it!  We save hundreds of dollars a month by making them paying the processing fees.  Give people a choice by passing along the discount and they'll start using Bitcoin.  For a company like Overdtock with razor thin margins it double they profit margins!  Online checkout is the future of most everything.  Including walking into a restaurant!

I agree.  I see a few more bursting bubbles before Bitcoin finally levels off into a stable currency.  I think right now is still a great time to buy and hold as we go through this process.  Once it is widely trusted, it will only fluctuate 10% or less a year.  We should have at least 2 or 3 more bubbles.  I think each bubble will be smaller than the previous, as if you study Bitcoin's history that is already happening.  The Wallstreet phase is coming and I think that is the next bubble that puts it to $10,000 a coin then will have a retrace, back up, then retrace and back up.  I think 20 years from now the Winklevoss prediction of $40,000 a coin will be the closest to accurate.

In ten years, my most educated guess is a range of $10,000 - $40,000.  Who's to say for sure but I put 10k at the bottom of the range b/c that's about what you could expect minimum if Bitcoin becomes a store of value.  $40K is at top b/c that is about a 800 Billion market cap.  There's no way Bitcoin will go to one trillion in 10 years from now!  OK a trillion in 20 is possible but not 10 years!  Let's be realistic!  Now who not not be happy here with Bitcoin at $10,000 in 10 years?  I'd be a half a millionaire since I own 50 coins but really people are nuts putting anything more than 30% of there savings in there!  Imagine people who put 90% in at $1000 a coin!  Damn! or even at $500.  My cost avg. is at $365 but I got no more in than I can take to lose!  Anything more is nuts.  Bitcoin is not proven to be a store of value yet.  I am huge fan but I will not put anymore into this till for sure its going to be adopted by Wallstreet at the very least.

Yes, its Free to buy and sell.  Unlike Coinbase.  I still use Coinbase's Cold Deep Vault - Only not to keep all my eggs in the same place.  But yes its better.  I been using it for over 1 month and half in invite mode only.  They gave you $10 bucks then just for signing up.  Looks like now they stopped that.  Who knows how many people signed up just today?  Probably tons and about half from Coinbase.  I my opinion this type of service is what drives BTC to become mainstream.  Especially, as more and more consumers have the service more and more places to spend and so on.  I think stores will do more and more discounts with BTC further driving adoption.  Online what's your choice credit cards/   Blah!  BTC is the much better opinion for both merchants and customers.

I would Only invest 15-20% max.  I am a huge proponent of Bitcoin and I still will not invest more than that!  As you already know its highly volatile and you have got to be willing to sit and watch your investments going up/down 70% or more its insane.  However, with all the volatility comes opportunity as the Bitcoin ecosystem grows.  Just remember if the world does not accept BTC, the value will go to near Zero.  I suspect it to be a small chance the world does not adopt but there is that chance it never takes off and we are all left holding an empty bag.  If its con't to grow the volatility will smooth out and then you could go up to 30-50% but of course the upside would be less.  Just be careful putting to much in if you can't afford to lose it all!  Good luck!

What if by paying in BTC the Merchant offered a 3% discount?  We do it.  Customers would always rather have the 3% taken off for processing now rather than say earn 1% cash back later.  I think with Bitcoin you are missing the point.  Satoshi said (and I say) it has use cases.  Mainly, e-commerce, developing countries as currency, hedge against the dollar (like gold 2.0) and micro-payments.  Just having an alternative to government money is great.  Say for example BTC existed during the Financial Crisis… think about it we could have just let the banks fail.  So what we have our own bank/money and would not effect us.  Just imagine the value of BTC if there really was a major crisis. For the merchant not shipping the product or wrong product that can happen without paying in Bitcoin.  Think about paying in cash - its the same.  99.9999% of merchants are going to take care of you even if you paid the bill in cash (or e-cash) its in there best interest to take care of you.

As in any market (especially) lower markets caps, a big player can go into a stock or in the case BTC - start to buy the shares in the selloff creating an increase in Price per Share.  As traders/investors see this as the bottom but its a trap, as the Big Player creates a "SELL WALL" the price suddenly starts to fall breaking the prior low, making a new low.  The cycle is repeated over and over until the sellers are "SHAKEN OUT OF TREE".  He/she the Big Whale can test it to see before placing a serious of buy orders at the "CONTROLED BOTTOM".  Then the price massively spikes!  Look at it $350 this whale or whales were doing that.  They buy small chunks multiple times only to create the illusion of a the price falling.  Yes, it is but they are controlling that if you let them.  Best thing to do is buy into there panic.  Which I believe is near.

Once people understand the block chain more they will trust it.  I found out about Bitcoin summer of 2013 and it took me till early 2014 before I understood what it does and I am a tech friendly-econ guy.  Imagine a granny.  Once the killer app is adapted it will take off.  Really at this point Bitcoin does not solve a regular person's problems.  Although, the bigger it gets the more it does becomes useful.  However, in the developing world it can become very useful as a currency.  I think that's where it goes mainstream first - Argentina or places in Africa. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:56:28
Let's see.  IMO its already very "cheap" so to speak considering how far its fundamentally came this year.  Big Whales are playing with this to get in low before the next run.  I am waiting to back the truck up if I get the chance $260ish.
@_date: 2014-09-19 12:53:19
Actually, its very practical when you use services like Circle.  The only thing holding it back is "not enough merchants accepting" but that's changing and so is it user friendliness. We are still year 94' of the pre-Internet Era.  Not many still get it - trust me if they did the price would be sitting at $40,000 not $380!  
@_date: 2014-09-27 16:53:37
Economics/Finance and Computer Science.  Bitcoin is a mix of both.  If you notice the early adopters were the "computer nerds" then Finance/Econ people such as myself woke up and saw its potential to change Global banking.  Digitals Currencies are def here to stay, so its a great idea to focus in this blooming space!  Good luck!

BTW the "SELL WALL" is created when the start to sell their shares, after they bought into a natural sell down.  Please understand they cannot hold the price long term its a short term Price Action.  However, if enough people panic selling "shaken out of tree" they can get in really cheap.

Well when I say near I mean 2016.  Consumer friendly services like Circle will attract more and more people to use Bitcoin, as they scale out of Beta.  Its practically Free although their seems to me a small loss (less than .001% in the spread)  I would guess they are making small amount there but its still better cheaper than Coinbase.  I don't know a lot how they generate income although it seems like they are acting as the market maker and profiting from the BTC spread.  From a practical stand point it just makes sense to Accept BTC as the business owner carries no risk when using Bitpay (free also).  Its just seems like a "no brainer" how its going to go mainstream.  Users carry little risk as well if the have an idea how much they are going to spend they can transfer daily spending money into there Circle accounts and likely receive discounts when they pay in BTC.  If you go to my E-Store you can see auto-matically we give a 3% discount when the customers pay in BTC.  I think right now the Only thing holding BTC back is lack of users but that's changing quickly.  You will also notice transactions are increasing near all time highs.  Maybe I am wrong and will lose all my coins value but it just makes sense this gets adopted gradually this year into next - then 2016 its goes everywhere!  like 98-99' Internet adoption curve!  One thing is clear.  The upside potential is huge but if BTC is not accepted then the value collapse.  Its all or near nothing with investing in Bitcoins.  If people don't use it - its worthless :-)
@_date: 2014-09-17 02:38:09
Is this a joke?  I mean if it were that easy to make money day trading we'd all be rich.  Unfortunately, the prices can just as easily go down instead of up.  Then you are left holding the bag.  Or even worst the stock takes out your stop loss then promptly goes to the moon!  Now that's opportunity cost!  
@_date: 2014-11-11 02:54:20
Agreed.  It will likely succeed.  For me its a 18K mistake or makes me near a millionaire.  Its going to zero or at least 40K per coin.  When people don't even now they are using it, then it goes mainstream… we are getting there.  Look how far we came since last year.  I mean with usability not the price obviously.  Eventually, the price has to go back up if its going to be widely used as a currency and payment rail system.

The Paypal video was huge I my opinion.  I went and immediately bought more BTC soon as I saw it.  For Paypal to even mention Bitcoin was impressive and its def going to be going to be available at a later date into the Paypal account or they would have never advertised "magic money, not bound by...".  IMO what is happening is traders are getting bored with it dumping it and I have seen many times a stock do the same thing.... have huge gains then go back and test a major support area before it then proceeds to go up to da moon!  I am just saying this seems to be going back to test $350, where there seems to be major support area.  I think it will go up once it goes down a little more.  The Winklevoss COIN EFT - we should be getting word and PayPal or big name will officially make there move into the space.  I am buying now b/c of the good news coming later!  Good luck!

Its just altering data on a ledger system.  The more people use it, the more trust and stability it has.  Nothing more.  Now a question.  Do more people use Bitcoin compared to last year?  The answer is Yes.  So if more people are using it over time that means the value of the system is worth more.  Its the Blockchain that has the intrinsic value.  It's b/c of the miners who are updating the ledger every 10 minutes processing the transactions and verifying that these "transfer of values" actual have taken place.  That could Bitcoin, Smart Contracts, Side Chain Alts, Votes, Stocks, or anything of value.  If Blockchain survives "always able to verify securely these transfer of values" Bitcoin will also.  I believe Bitcoin has a great chance at becoming the reserve currency of the future.  Yes, other Alt coins will still exist but the Blockchain - the 5 Billion one and the one Bitcoin runs on will be the most trusted and used.  Why b/c its "Virus in Numbers".

Nope, BTC is less Gold 2.0 rather than a payments network.  The value will grow on adoption and people using the blockchain payments rail system.  For the this go mainstream the user will not need to know they are using Bitcoin, rather it will be send .50 cents to Netflix for watching 1 hr of time.  Scan QR code - boom gone.  The user will not go buy BTC the send, it will become seem less.  You can already see the evolution taking place in Circle, the next step is to have instant buy.  They already said they would launch it.  Now as BTC matures it may become a store of value - in its current state it is not.  Also, it is neither a true currency till we can get a larger market cap and less volit.  I think in time it will be like Gold 2.0 just not there yet.
@_date: 2014-10-06 17:14:21
Panic buying is the best way to make money.  Even if it goes lower you just buy more.  Of course your investment has to eventually make it longterm or you lose everything :-)  That's the art of it.
@_date: 2014-09-23 02:28:38
This will likely happen.  Little by little just like what we are seeing today.  Then I suspect a service like Paypal integrates (basically they already made that announcement a couple weeks ago).  At some future point will hit that critical mass, where it just starts to run, as more and more companies accept it.  One great thing Bitcoin has going for it, is that for the business there is Zero risk accepting BTC and for the business its like cash but better b/c it deposits directly into your bank account.  The consumer takes the risk and (small expenses) buying/holding it (volatility).  It's highly likely we will see a new business model emerge, where the customer will have the option to save money when paying with BTC.  With Paystand they automatically give the customer that option to choose Credit Card +3%, ACH +.25, or BTC $0.00  expense.  In the end both the business and the customer will find it the superior way to accept payments.  Ultimately, the 51% attack and the centralized mining will be addresses into the protocol.  At this point in time the chances of Bitcoin "the currency" will go mainstream are fairly high.  Its unlikely, another digital currency will dominate over Bitcoins b/c its the clear leader and the network effect of money is so great it will likely gain the highest market cap making it the most stable.  I do think a couple other Alt coins will become very popular as well.  Likely, 3-4 like Visa, Matercard, AMEX, Discover b/c merchants don't want to mess with accepting more.  What you mentioned above is what most people will do - hold some, spend some.  Like a bank account but the difference is holding BTC long term is going to be much better than Dollars, with a steady dilution from the Feds!  IMO small deflation would be better but that's another post!
@_date: 2014-09-20 17:02:13

They are working on a BTC check.  Circle.com has mentioned it by means of instantly converting your linked Bank Account in USD to BTC, then to BTC to USD straight to the end users bank account in USD.  Right now I am not sure if there is a service that does this but I know its coming.  When it does watch out this is the type of service that really puts BTC in the mainstream usage!  Users will not ever know they used Bitcoin to do International transfer.  All they know its Instant, Almost Free and Secure.  Bitcoin is the rail that gets you there!  I bet if you do some research you can find a service right now that you could do it.  However, as of right now I do think anyone's is efficiently doing it for near free.  If I were you I would buy the BTC on circle.com then that very second, send it to BTC address having that person instantly take it out.  Who knows maybe BTC goes up in value while you do it.  Or at least its cheaper/faster than Western Union with currently volatility.  
@_date: 2014-12-28 17:05:11
It's not Warren Buffet's style to even invest in Tech.  He goes after companies with low P/E valuations.  He would never buy Bitcoin, at least not in his remaining lifetime.  George Soros on the other hand would be the type of Investor to buy some Bitcoin.  Its no question whether crypto currencies will exist in the future, being used on a scale.  Really, the Only question remains will it be Bitcoin one of the ones to survive.  I think the answer is yes b/c its protocol makes it a long term store of value.  I think the side chains running on the block chain will be used for most transactions.  In my view, I see Bitcoin just like Gold but instantly transferable anywhere in the world.  On another note, we see more and more businesses accepting Bitcoin and more people using it, so it may turn out just by the "huge network effort" money has BTC in the future will remain the most widely accepted crypto!  I just say buy and hold it 10-20 years and you'll be very happy later.  Kinda like buying Amazon in 99', lots of up and down's but longterm you would have made a killing just holding it.

I think what's going to happen is once people finally start taking Bitcoin seriously it will stabilize.  It needs to be around longer for people to believe in it.  Still too new for must people and you can't blame them for what they here on the news -terrible!  Once they finally realize no one can hack and there are copies of the public ledger nearly everywhere, they will believe in it.  I think its 10-15 years away from seeing its potential.  It will likely be much bigger than we think but take much longer than we think!
@_date: 2014-10-06 12:06:33
Yeap, this whale is not that smart.  If he would had sold into the bubble, rather he choose to sell into a likely longterm bottom??  And to go out a put a huge order in at 300, there's better ways to do this.  It most be some new money person who had no idea how to maximize their profits.
@_date: 2014-12-11 01:14:31
It needs to mature first.  Over time the value will rise.  Although 2014 was a terrible year for Bitcoin's price, the technology itself has made tremendous progress.  VC investments at an all time and transactions rates soaring to new records.  In 2016, BTC mining rate halves so that into itself would make the price go up.  I still think we hit $10,000 a coin by early 2017.
@_date: 2014-09-19 02:31:34
Yes, some investors are getting board with it and taking losses from buying earlier last year or beginning of this year.  But if you tune out the price Only at around $400, you'll see the fundamentals getting stronger by the day.  Simply put more and more people are accepting BTC as a form of payment and more user friendly services such as "Circle" going in the masses.  The price may very well go lower Mid-300's likely.  However, that does mean its the end of BTC just a shake out of weaker hands.  Last year the prices got to far ahead of themselves!  To much hype!  Now everyone is bored again and the prices are at lower levels.  For sure the is a great buy here at these levels.  I would not say we are going into the mass adaption phase yet but rather this next leg up will be from Institutional Investors.  The catalyst will be the BTC EFT's launching and the user friendly BTC services.  I am certain once we get a launch date will see higher BTC prices.  Bargain buyers trying to buy at lower levels will help support price in the meantime.  That's my opinion, as I just bought more and will buy again if prices go down lower without justification!  Good luck!
@_date: 2014-12-14 16:37:19
6 months to a year in Advance, before halving occurs BTC prices will rise.  Why?  B/c less dilution of BTC.  Miners will effectively get half of current rate.  What is its is now 360 every 10 min. so that will drop to 130 every ten minutes.  That's great for BTC value and as it means price will likely go up before it every halves and its very likely prices will double at least just do to mining halved.  Miners will be happy b/c prices rises to compensate halving of BTC to them.
@_date: 2014-09-29 22:48:13
Games.  Remember 5 Billion market cap is Only this size of small successful company in stock market terms.

@_date: 2014-09-14 05:45:14
Circle cost me nothing.  That's the future!  Sending/Receiving money is just like email - Instant and Free.  In the end (10-15 years) Bitcoin will win over the masses b/c its simply the most efficient way to send/receive money.  The volatility will smooth out as the market cap increases in size.  The ETF's coming will make it easy for Institutional Investors to buy driving market cap to 400 billion or more. In the meantime, you'll see a bumping ride up with lots of volatility.  First, it will take out Western Union/Money Gram, as volatility is irrelevant when you can instantly for swing in and out of fiat to digital money back or forth sending International payments for Free.  From what I understand Circle is making their money on the backend and by offering upgraded services.  Once they scale in the US and Internationally you'll see the "Mass Adoption" phase of Bitcoin!  We are about to enter that stage by next year.  Coinbase just went International, so the infer structure is about to massely change on a Global scale as more and more people accepting Bitcoin so will the Transaction volumes.

Agreed.  Its a super price considering the mass adoption is near.  BTC Only very recently is become user friendly and more and people are starting to use it b/c of that.  $10,000 by next year. The BTC EFT's launching soon will enable Institutional buyers to easy buy Bitcoin.

Dollar will con't is debasement decline.  Bitcoin will ultimately be a long term store of value and a payment network.  In the future we will have alts to the US dollar - a competing currency if you will.  The dollar will not be replaced but rather made more efficient by the use of Digital Currencies.  There will be several other ALT coin that rise up to compete with BTC.  BTC value will approach $40,000 per coin with 10-15 years.  End of story :-)

Once people finally grasp how it really works and how the central banks has destroyed the middle class wealth… they will have that "ah" moment too.  As more and more people use it, like in some cases they have to use it b/c micro payments are not even possible with fiat currency, then the have another "ah" moment!!! In 2-3 years it will be used moderately.  In 5 years used by the masses, in full adaption.  In time… in time friends.

Volatility is a major issue even for the die hards.  I bought my first Bitcoin at $1000 and bought it all the way down to $200 with a cost average at $385.  I held since 2013.  What do you mean by Bitcoin's Volatility isn't any issue?  I am down 45% and I invested/traded into stocks my whole life.  How would someone who knows nothing about finance feel about buying Bitcoin?  Its pretty risky even for us die hards.  When we pair the dollar with Bitcoin it finally makes it useful.  Otherwise its a long time before any Joe would use it.

The US stocks will trade flat or down to a 20% correction as interest rates increase and economy sees lackluster growth.  The Fed loves to create bubbles so who really knows if they decided to keep interest rates at record lows.  Its unfortunate b/c the average person still does understand there's 3 trillion in new dollars out there sitting in bank reserves waiting to be loaned out.  The problem is we don't know what exactly will happen.  Inflation?  Where does 3 trillion in new money go?  Nobody knows.
@_date: 2014-09-23 12:56:38
It will happen again.  I remember at $100 I was like that and watched it go to $1200 within the next few months.  I did not really understand it so I was like "what"?  I mean it looks like a huge bubble "monopoly money" when you first glance at it and God knows if you only read the news headlines it totally looks like a scam.  However, after I did the research to understand Blockchain technology "the distributed public ledger" I was like wow this is not going anywhere and will con't to grow.  Unfortunately, by the time I figured that out I was buying high but now I managed to cost avg very well, thanks to the current prices.  By Mid-Next Year price will be much higher if not sooner.  Good luck!

Circle - is Free just as they promised.  Of course, this is assuming you smartly linked your bank account!  The whole point of Bitcoin is not to pay fees!  Services like Circle is what will make BTC go mainstream.  Think about it for one sec if everyone had this service why would you need ATM's, Credit Cards, Bank Wires?  You wouldn't as you could easy Bank - Send/Receive money for Free.  Just like email Free and Instant!   They introducing a new tool for volatility where you instantly convert fiat to BTC or BTC to fiat, so there is no risk of holding BTC. Once public opinion changes holding BTC will be as common as carrying cash.  In the meantime, the "volatility" should be a welcome to the "early adopters" holding BTC for the long run.  Its easy to say this will go 10x times or much much more current market BTC prices.  If you had a 9 inning ball game this would Only be the 2nd to 3rd inning in the BTC game.  This will develop into something big b/c when you start using services like Circle you will see very fast why BTC is a superior means of exchange.  We have to remember the "VC Tech Money" only got involved with BTC 1-2 years ago and much of the BTC eco-system has not had enough time to be developed.  2015 is the mass adoption year for BTC simply b/c services like Circle and Coinbase are going into "big scale up" mode.  In Circle, for example its hard to find a reason not to use it.  The Only thing lacking is scale or others accepting it.  Remember Facebook 2004?  College kids only very very small scale.  It was not that practical b/c few had it.  By 2008 (4 years after) they launched to the public and it blew-up overnight!  BTC is going to work the same as more and more accept, well then more and more will accept.  Its like the Egg and Chicken.  Which one came first?  BTC is going to take longer before maturity b/c its peoples money and digital currencies for most people will taking time to warm up to but the techy crowd - 16 - 40 year old will adapt first, then the baby boomers and the old folks "probably not" as they don't use Twitter, FB, Online Banking either.  Its going to be a long game in BTC - 20 years before it fully matures - similar to what the Internet went through.  Good luck!

The government could create their own ledger but we are light years away from that happening.  Plus, that would be centralized - which is not much better than what we currently have.  In the meantime Bitcoin will become big enough to become the Digital Currency of choice.  Dollars will be around for a long time but does not mean Bitcoin and fiat can't coexist both successfully.

@_date: 2015-05-03 01:14:13
I think a certain group of people will but the status quo will not accept the volatility therefore we need services like Circle USD wallets to get the masses on board.  Even getting them to use that will be a stretch but as Businesses start to offer Bitcoin discounts and cut the switch on Credit Cards the customers will start to change their mindsets.
@_date: 2014-12-31 17:02:17
Over the next few years it will go mainstream. Along with the adoption so will the price go upwards.  There will be bubbles along the way but over a period of time Bitcoin will be become stable - meaning 10%-15% flux per year.  By emerging market standards that's stable.  Just enjoy the ride up over the next 10 years!

May I add.  End user could convert into any local currency not just USD.

Not if your holding for 5 for years or more.  Sorry but Bitcoin is now more widely used than ever, so anyone who bought should not be selling more rather we should all buy more.  That's of course if you believe Bitcoin will continue to grow.  If no then yes sell all - get out and stay out!  Its still the lowest cost way to send money through the Internet, so I see a wider adaption rate increasing as it becomes more user friendly.
@_date: 2014-12-18 21:04:32

Until very recently it was not user friendly.  People will use it now.  No one used FB either till they allow non-college kids to use it.  It will ramp up fast.  Look how Bitcoins came in the last two years.  Its just re-basing for the next leg up.  
@_date: 2015-05-03 01:51:32
Yeah, if dollars are moving in Bitcoin the token has to increase in value to match those dollars.  $40,000 or more is a given if it starts to be use globally on a massive scale.
@_date: 2014-11-01 04:41:48
For a moment think about the possibilities not just imagine the world in its current state.  Bitcoin can open up things we never have before… like crypto-finance and micro payment of .05 cents to read an article.  They are working on side-chains where such currencies like Litecoin would do the micro payments but ultimately be linked to Bitcoin's value.  I am long maybe 10 years we see the price reach around $40K, as more and more people use it.  Don't worry man, the dollar will still be there.  Crypto-currency just will compete with it not replace it!  Its possible to have the gov't have there centralized digital currency too.  Don't count that out, although I think ultimately Bitcoin as a store of value will gain the most trust.  
@_date: 2014-09-19 22:36:26
Hopefully it goes down a little more, so we all have a chance to buy more.  No one should be buying if they aren't willing to hold for at least a few years.  The prices going down is not a bad thing b/c the ones who would like to own more are now able to buy 3 times as many for the same price as late last year.  I still expect this to hit $5,000 next year as the adoption curve steepens.  Its just makes sense the Blockchain to be a better more efficient means of moving money around.  IMO it moved to much last year from Asia buying it at year end.  That was crazy but I am sure will see it again down the road.  I don't worry about a "bad trade" b/c it can turn around, as long as the Blockchain is running good I don't worry about it and try to buy in these situations for the long haul!  Good luck!

Bitcoin will not be stored and used by the masses until 5-10 years into the future.  Bitcoin "killer app" is its ability to transfer value anywhere in the world instantly.  USD wallets along side BTC instant transfer are critical to its success.  Only until "into the future will Bitcoin become stable to be alternative currency to fiat".  Give to two more years and the price will be above ATH b/c the APPS being built around it will be useful.  Its all coming but in time.  No one should plan on selling there BTC till 5+ years for now.  Until its have to time to be useful.  For us techies it already is but for the mainstream they want touch it until its a simple as pushing a button.  
@_date: 2015-05-15 18:00:41
There will only be one Bitcoin!  Sure other alts will con't to exist but in reality how useful will they be?  Unless they do something dramically different and better than Bitcoin Blockchain does.  All my bets are on Bitcoin not the alts.  In this case the networking effects of money are the most important.  Bitcoin has already achieved hurdles other alts will fail to clear.  
@_date: 2015-05-24 17:08:40
The price is going to $10,000... just a matter a time.  I tried to buy before the bubble last time but I almost got GOXED!  Now this this I been buying all the way down with cost avg. at $400.

Circle, is the very beginning of the "customer adaption phase".  This is the type of user friendly "free" wallets that will take Bitcoin mainstream, as they scale Internationally.  If you noticed Coinbase just went Global in Europe the other day.  Like we all know Bitcoins are only as good as the people accepting it.  The more user friendly ramp-ons like Circle the faster Bitcoin adaption and prices excel!  
@_date: 2015-05-03 01:53:23
Its very likely Bitcoin will be used as a store of value adding the most % to its long term price per coin.

A bug that cannot be fixed for a long period causing people to lose enough trust it can never recover.  Governments are a threat with tough regulation (although Bitcoin cannot be stopped or banned) it could be hindered to grow fast.  I think this was a problem more last year early this year.  Now they had time to know what it is and react across the world.  Honestly, the Governments don't seem to be reacting that hostile towards it.  China in particular has backed off from earlier this year.  When the threaten to ban Bitcoin and realized they couldn't effectively do that, they shut up!  The world is going to embrace it (digital currency) like the Internet but its going to happen first in Remit. and the developing world where you can clearly see the high friction to move money around.  They'll transfer BTC through a text message as the have cell phones already!  Companies are already their working on the ground with it.  Their are several companies that are live now!  The transactions are increasing if you look at blockchain info.  However, I think this is causing downward pressure near term on the prices until more "hoarders" come along.  The BTC EFT later this year will be out.  Hold tight for the next leg up!
@_date: 2015-01-28 00:14:12
Everyday the eco-system grows.  The reason Coinbase will grow is b/c its building on the open protocol of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin will prosper b/c of the increasingly incredible apps being built on top of it.  You simply can't do that with any other financial system.  Every time you buy a Bitcoin you are supporting the most crucial part of the system - the miners or I like to call them transaction gatekeepers!  Bitcoin will con't to develop and grow for a very long time.

@_date: 2015-01-22 13:41:27
That's a dumb statement.  People going out and learning a second language is ridiculous thing to ask.  Sending money free and instant to anybody in the world is not.  Especially, if you have no bank to begin with.  Bitcoin will soon be so easy to use and understand my Grandma would use it.  Everyday it is getting better.  Bitcoin success depends on how useful the Apps make it.  Also, the price speculation fuels its growth!  Its a near perfect free market system.  Probably the best in the world!
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:10:21
BTW if you are instantly buying and sending the amount you need you don't have to be exposed to hardly any volatility.  At the same time you need to be hoarding Bitcoins for long term savings.  Only spending your Bitcoin will create more downward selling pressure as retailers instantly cash out to dollars.  That's why every time a new merchant accepts it the prices go down.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:00:25
Bitcoin's long term price will be determined on its usability and the usability is increasing everyday, meaning that some time in the future the price will be much more if people are using it!  Bitcoin came a long way in 2014 but the current price is not reflecting that.  I think the bottom was today and we'll see the price go back shortly.  If not then fuck it and my 20K I am not selling!  Price can go to zero!  
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:08:49

@_date: 2015-01-31 17:49:57
jstolfi, you are talking about the chicken and egg problem Bitcoin has but will soon be solved as the network grows even larger.  Anyone can see that Bitcoin is more and more widely accepted.

cost average down, then hold it for another 5 years.  its either going much higher or to near zero.  I think its a 90% chance of adaption in the longterm and I give it a 10% chance of failing.  The biggest hurdles will be the governments but just like the Internet its unstoppable.  Either way I am in it till the end.

If the Feds made their own Alt-Coin, they could just make as many as they wanted and it would be any different than paper money.

I bought it as a long term investment and I am not pumping BTW.  If Bitcoin works out in the long run which I believe is very possible the coins will be worth much more than $1000.  I still feel good about my cost avg. of $435 no matter how low this ends up going.  Remember 2011 was at $35 to $2 and even the folks who bought at $35 huge returns by 2013.  If you think Bitcoin is over its not.  I will go through another price growth phase and it will happen sooner than you think!  The eco-system grew by a massive amount in 2014 although the price went to opposite direction.

Does not work.  Russia tried that for years.  They set a million prices weekly.  What you need is a free market where the supply meets demand = price.  Let the market price it.  Bitcoin is like a micro-cap stock, volatile.  Once it gets a bigger market cap it will only vary 10-15% per year.  In the long run it will likely work out, as the applications being launch (300 million 2014 in VC money) go live.  Just let the market price it and in a few more years later you'll see it much more stable.  Eventually very stable  but its got to mature.  Start thinking 10 years from now as a world wide currency.
@_date: 2015-01-08 05:56:21
By having a predictable deflationary currency it encourages savings, at the same rate individual purchasing power increases thus causing an incentive to buy goods and services.  The problem with inflationary currencies like the dollar is it creates moral hazards, whereas banks and individuals take extreme risk to seek a return to beat the inflation.  If you just had a currency that increased in value over long periods of time, society would not go through economic crashes b/c people would have enough saved money that went up in value instead of down to support the economy.  For example, if the Bitcoin prices go down (inflationary) like 2014 I do not want to spend it b/c my purchasing power also went down.  If it goes up like (deflationary) like 2013 I want to spend it b/c I now have a highly purchasing power and need goods/services no matter the prices!  You see the Feds have it all wrong.  The Keynesian economic theory is morally flawed.  If you want a stable monetary system society should adapt the Austrian economic system, like the way Bitcoin follows. You see in Business school they teach you that you need some inflation to keep folks spending, but that's wrong.  The government wants to believe that BS b/c they need to inflate the debt away.  That's the ultimate hidden tax the common people cannot see directly so its keeps the at bay.  If they really knew and understood what the Feds are doing with there money they be outraged.  Try raising taxes….ooooouch!  Or just inflate the shit out the national debt….. silence!  If you are the government which one do you choose if you want perpetual spending and wars?

That's incorrect.  Greek banks are not insolvent, as they went through final re-capitalization last summer.  The recent sell-off in the markets are coming from the leftist Syriza party elected.  Its created a lot of uncertainty there but the banks are not insolvent.  The Syriza party is trying to re-negotiate the debt.
Why is it that some of these Bitcoin people think the whole fiat system will suddenly collapse?  Europe will muddle through it.  The fiat-central banking system is not ideal but it will still work and survive.  BTW I am a huge Bitcoin fan and investor in the currency but that does mean I think the Fiat system is going to be doomed over night.  Think of it like wind erosion with tiny grains of sand slowly being carried away.  That's your fiat money long term.  Bitcoin will become both a store of value and a medium of exchange with the latter the most important for mass adoption.  Its both Gold 2.0 and digital-instant cash.  Dollars will co-exist with Bitcoin.

Better how many Bitcoins you have.  Over time the price will go up.  A "cheaper" price means you can buy more with less money.  There's no sufficient data to suggest the fundamentals of Bitcoin has changed from when it was at over $1000 or now at $260.  I personally, watched it go from $100 last year to $1200, only b/c at that time I did not have enough understanding to go out and buy it.  Now that I understand it the price really does not matter to me.  Although, a cheaper price is better to buy more.  I admit of buying a few at $1000, a few at $800, a few at $600, more at $500 and a lot at $300.  Does that make me a bad investor in Bitcoin next 3-5 years?  I guess we'll have to wait and see.
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:54:25
IDK, it already fell down over 80% to $170.  Transactions are gaining and so is adoption so we may of very well ended the long bear market in Bitcoin.  You probably know the story the more people use it the more other people use it.  Especially, in Remittance it seems to really be picking up overseas and to me that's where one of Bitcoin use cases is.

2015 we'll see another big price increase in BTC prices.  I got in about a year ago too and everyday I get more excited about Bitcoin, although I am a slight loss investing in it after year that has not scared me off as I see the Bitcoin eco-system grown tremendously since I first found out about it.  Also, it took me about 6 months to really understand it and once you do finally understand it takes the fear out of holding it.  At some point this will be used in everyone's daily life.

Its coming and when it does "shielding the volatility from the user" mainstream will catch on!  Users don't want the volatility just the function of sending money cheaply and instantly.  As the Bitcoin currency matures users will be more likely to keep funds in a more stable Bitcoin.  Or at least you could hold Bitcoin overnight and not worry about losing 20% of its value.
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:58:07
Bitcoin will only get better and better over the coming years adding to its value intrinsic and eventually to the market price.  Its a beautiful system which will constantly evolve to the user needs.  Bitcoin 2.0 will likely be even bigger than the Bitcoin currency itself.  Although, its very likely Bitcoin as currency will succeed due the applications being developed around it.  It's a beautiful future for both the currency and decentralized platforms it enables.

The Bitcoin eco-system has grown tremendously since last year when the price was at $1000+  So sometime in future the price will rebalance.  I still hold to my original thesis that Bitcoin in the end is the cheapest and easy way to receive payments.  All you need is a wallet address.  No other system that Apple or Microsoft can develop will ever make it that easy and cheap to send money.

I agree with the bubble theory due to manipulation mostly on part from GOX that started from $200.  However, Bitcoin eco-system has fundamentally improved at least 4 times since then.  Really the price should be at $800 right now if you are judging from this angle.  Miners coins will halve next year so the closer we get this, the more buying pressure will occur.

Also, I would like to add the volatility problem Bitcoin currently has will be solved.  Developers are currently working with pegged side-chains where you can send your funds in as dollars but send it in Bitcoin.  The Key thing to keep in mind Bitcoin is being built from the ground up so it takes time to develop the Apps that make it mainstream.

The problem is when you are out of the Bitcoin eco-system which is mostly males 25-45 years old you don't have a market that understand it enough to use it.  About 50% of the population still has not even heard of Bitcoin.

Not true.  Some domains started off a couple bucks but as the Internet become useful, they went for 100' of thousands and now even a million bucks for website such as   If people or machines use Bitcoin to transact payments to one another it will be worth much more than it is today.  With the decentralized exchanges like Bitshares coming out this year, you really don't even need price stability to gain full adoption.  It will only cost a few pennies to trade Bitcoin against other currencies.  I will tell what will happen friend.  You can put your Bitcoins in as dollars and convert them back to Bitcoin when you are ready to send payment.  In the future they will be options where you are exposed to zero BTC volatility while you be in full control of your keys.  Bitstamp and centralized exchanges are over!  Bitcoin will be huge in 5 years!  Watch and see!

When you buy Bitcoins you are investing into the miners and block chain.  Its not true what they say about Bitcoin has no value.  It does b/c people use it and its the most secure and widely used block chain in the and will likely stay as the leader for a very long time.

Building a professional e-commerce site from scratch is difficult if you are not a developer.  Plus, I don't have the time nor money to do it.  I already did it for my Salon as I hired a professional company but ended up with tons of work and time to make it look great!  
So with Shopify I can easy accept Bitcoin.  That's not the problem.  The problem is (if you would kindly and carefully read my post) getting the customers to pay with it!  We advertise we accept Bitcoin and give them a 5% discount!  What can we do to get them to pay in Bitcoin is the question.

I agree.  You just need to have a base belief in long term outcome.  The adaption of Bitcoin as the currency is ever increasing and BTC is Only the first App of many that will be created to run on the Blockchain.  I believe the Blockchain itself is everlasting and therefore Bitcoin shall be too b/c you cannot have one without the other.  What makes the Blockchain so power its Bitcoin b/c its literally paying the miners to secure the network.  Adjustments will be made to the code along the way as it adapts to our ever changing world - of course the majority of miners will have to agree.  That is what makes Bitcoin eternal is that it can adapt and it can re-boot, (if there ever was an attack) Long as they were current and accurate copies of the ledger on computers all of the world.  I think the price will stabilize within the next 5 years b/c you need remember the more people who download wallets the more copies of ledgers there is and the more people who own a piece of Bitcoin the more stable the value.  I have no doubt Long term it will probably be the greatest investment I will have ever made and will have ever made.  I believe long term 20 years the price will settle b/t $40,000 to $1,000,000.  If in 50 years it truly proves itself as a long term store of value we could see a 1 trillion market cap.  I am def in the Winklessvoss camp but Only after many years ahead will we know.  Its critical that Bitcoin survives the next five years.  Once we get past that I think enough people will have heard of it and be comfortable enough to use it and hold it.

Third, it reduces cost and there's zero chance of chargeback.  It's so easy to get a business to accept Bitcoin once they understand the benefits.  You can go to Bitpay and get signed up in 5 minutes!  Yes, you can choose to have it 100% converted to dollars but not all companies are doing that.  As people gain confidence in the network the will be holding more and more Bitcoin.  The Chicken and Egg problem will soon be solved.
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:17:09
I am in the same boat as you.  Buying just like you described.  I think now I 40 BTC with a cost avg. of around $450.  Although, it has been a heart droping year I feel great about my holdings long term.  I wanted to buy BTC in the summer of 2013 but GOX turned me off.  At that time I didn't even know about coinbase!  Shit!  If would wire that money to GOX I would have made a killing then they fucks would have lost it anyway!  GOX really set Bitcoin back at least a year!  At least now that's behind us!

Perfectly said Sir which is why exactly I invested into Bitcoin in the first place!  Here is 1000 bits @_date: 2014-09-25 23:13:12
Circle kinda already does that with making it as user friendly as possible.  However, I understand your point.  There needs to be a way for the "Average Joe" to login into there wallet - click and buy it without every having to manually go in a out of Bitcoin.  The average person just wants the discount and does not want to hold any Bitcoin - at least until the volatility levels.  I think what you are taking about is already coming.  Circle, said they would release something later to eliminate volatility and my best guess is this is it.  The problems are the traditional banking, not the Bitcoin.  You cannot go in and out of fiat like you can BTC b/c its going to take a few days to clear on a large transaction.  If the banks just get out of the way and the regulation on Bitcoin is lite, this will be a competing currency to the dollar.  Bitcoin is much more efficient at everything and the only thing holding it back is the uncertainty of the regulation.  Once the market cap approaches 40 Billion it will become very stable.  Maybe at most vary 10-15% a year.  Once we get there is going to stabilize further but 6 billion for a currency is nothing.  Its like a damn penny stock at the moment.  I hope and I am betting 15% of my capital this takes off!  Lets see, cuz if the regulation of BTC is strict it will limit is true potential and could only be a nichy small limited currency that Only us clowns are stuck with.  I am very long and positive on BTC, just the regulation worries me.  Bitcoin as you know is unstoppable but if the these banking duches decided to go hostile and cut the bank ties off to BTC is going to be hard for mass adoption to take place!  But yes going back to post its only a matter of time before business start offering "built in discount" when paying in BTC.

@_date: 2015-01-15 02:51:38
I believe this will happen.  Bitcoin will get bigger and bigger over time b/c the currency does not inflate away.  Your exactly right, people will learn to use it as a hedge against central banks cheap printing money!  At the same time Bitcoin is use as a medium of exchange on the Internet.  Users will not like keeping much in Bitcoin b/c volatility but you will not have to as services pop up that instantly sell your bitcoins for dollars on a reserve - shielding user from price swings.  Retailers will start offering more and more discounts when paying in Bitcoin b/c there liabilities go down.  Hell its even better than cash b/c people can steal cash (workers)  Anyway the missing link is the new Apps coming soon!
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:28:06

Blockchain is Bitcoin and Bitcoin is Blockchain.  They go hand in hand and you cannot have one without the other.  The media and their B/S.

Bitcoin will rule the future of business.

Yeah, everyone wants to issue their own money b/c its the surest way to "fuck other people over" to a fat cat sitting on your ass not doing nothing.  Oh shit I am out of money, Uncle Sam says, so let's just print some more (dilute the the buying power and inflate the debts away).  The beauty of Bitcoin is that its a protocol that no one entity can control.  The whole point of the mining to secure the network with massive redundancy of distributed ledgers across the world.  No gov't or entity can stop it or control it.  Give it two more years and we'll all be using it to pass value and store value via the blockchain using this little token called Bitcoin!

@_date: 2015-01-08 06:28:58
Great point markovcd.  Like he said, if you want an inflationary coin you are free to use Dogecoin but the most people I know want there money to go up in value over time, which precisely why they would never even think to by a coin that inflates its value over time.  We already had that money monopoly for 100's of years and that's called the US dollar.  The dollar is quite stable but at what real economic cost.  Its worth 5 cents to the dollar it was 100 years ago.  That is a terrible store of value.  Bitcoin is what I believe a great store of value and medium of exchange.  20 years from now Bitcoin is likely to be worth much more than now.  The dollar we know for sure will be worth much less than now.  I'll take Bitcoin.  As for using Bitcoin as a currency I would not think of it take way, rather a medium of exchange.  Already we see services such as Bitreserve eliminating the volatility in Bitcoin but gaining the benefits of Bitcoin.  I am predicting by next year Apps will be introduced where the service will instantly convert you Bitcoins to dollars but send them as Bitcoins to the recipient.  Right now that would cost about 1% in total to do that, using Circle to buy Bitcoins and Bitreserve to hold dollars and Bitpay (free) to convert for merchant.  But I think it will drop to about .05% next in total to do it.  Now the system is like piece milled by next year you'll see it so easy to use all in one system where you just send $15 to X then X gets the $15 in there Bank Account like a credit card but faster, cheaper, secure and accessible to the world as a payment option.  You'll start to see merchants dumping there credits acceptance for this option.  
@_date: 2015-05-03 01:18:39
Bitreserve is a good investment longterm and likely will have a positive impact on Bitcoin adaption (when they ever get all states on board).  Circle USD is very much the same as Bitreserve's dollar card.

Now is the time to be accumulating before the buying pressures start to really increase from the adoption starting to happen.  IMO prices will start to move up with services like Circle scaling making it easy and FREE to buy.  The only thing holding BTC back this past year was b/c it was to hard to buy and sell.  Coinbase did and good job but Circle is more user friendly and less costly than Base!  I think this was a huge thing!  Circle is much better news than Paypal IMO.  Although, if when Paypal integrates into their material goods wallet watch out!  The price either way is going to move up soon.

@_date: 2016-06-19 12:56:33
If to big to fail and can get majority of miners to agree then yes!  The is going to be one of the biggest differences of mentality in Ethereum compared it Bitcoin.  ETH not focused on being a currency like Bitcoin so it is taking an aggressive approach to growing DAPPS at all cost!  If there's a big fuck up in Ethereum at least in these early experimental stages then no problem let's just hard fork it if we can get majority of miners to agree to it.  This is totally different mentality than Bitcoin and personally why I am extremely bullish on Ethereum growth.  This quick thinking and aggressive approach to growing the DAPPS will pay off.  Who gives a fuck if there was a mistake over looked by everyone.  If its big enough and agreeded upon by majority then Hard Fork to put the fire out.  To be truely successful you going to have to get big companies to want to build on it.  Scaling and big fuck ups should not limit the growth of DAPPS.  This is why Bitcoin has big problem with growth beyond a currency.  It still does mean the price cannot grow into $10,000 a bitcoin or more but don't expect major companies to come build on the Bitcoin Blockchain when you are always limited cap. and development.  
@_date: 2016-06-17 02:53:12
This time the eco-system can handle it.  Don't forget BTC was up 52 times in 2013.  Currently we are only up over 100% for the year and I think this run still has a long ways to go before the "top".  ETH and other crypto assets are also running hard.  ETH is outperforming BTC.  ATH of crypto market cap is nearly been broken at 15 billion.  There is no telling how long this can last.  Maybe weeks and months more of crypto boom!  Right now there is no bubble yet.
@_date: 2016-06-18 04:43:46
Bitcoin Nazis I will start calling them.  Solution was fixed in 3 hours with Ethereum.  Bitcoin has a scaling problem that has not been fixed in 7 years.  I am going to have to agree with Fred Ehrsam from Coinbase about ETH surpassing BTC soon.  Sure I am long BTC but Ethereum has tremendous growth ahead of it.  Bitcoin had similar issue in 2010.  Nobody lost Ether so nothing really was lost today.  If you like ETH today was a great day to buy.  
@_date: 2016-06-26 11:32:15
Which is exactly why Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin despite its ups and downs.  Bitcoin needs competition on Core.  Bitcoin has succeed so far due to its size and first mover advantage.  As time passes its not going to be so clear it will maintain largest market cap.  Personally, I believe Bitcoin be successful in store of value but I am not positive Bitcoin is a winner take all.  I think Bitcoin and Ethereum will be successful, along with another one we have yet to discover its use case.  
@_date: 2016-06-11 13:13:55
Both fundamentals and price action are important.  Ben Graham famous quote was “In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.”  In other words fundamentals can diverge away from actual stock prices.  In my humble opinion, fundamental analysis works best in 3+ year timeframe, while daytrading fundamentals would not matter.  If you are holding a stock three weeks or less you should care less about fundamentals and focus on the chart only.
@_date: 2016-06-18 04:46:43

@_date: 2016-06-18 04:57:59
And Ethereum development has moved at a lighting pace compared to Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is good and I am long term holder but must say Bitcoin has an anarchy feel about its user base.  Ethereum is not trying to create a currency rather a system that can make the smart contracts tick.  I think the use cases are massive there.  You could easily have a gold back token like Digix that acts a better store of value running on Ethereum back by real Gold.

@_date: 2016-12-13 04:52:39
Hmm keep thinking that.  Ethereum is not trying to be a currency but a user friendly network DAPPS run on.  Ether could become store of value like Bitcoin once POS is release we will know the supply longterm but by all calculations Ether will only inflated 5% or less a year.  If you get huge DAPP growth the market cap could shot past Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-08 16:01:55
Tone is right.  SegWit will not pass and Flex Blocksize Capping pass work either.  If Bitcoin wants to scale there needs to be a hard fork and split the small blockers.  Highly risky though.  There could be two Bitcoins after.
@_date: 2016-12-09 05:00:19
I don't see how ETH is a scam coin.  It does everything I want it to do and 10x better than Bitcoin can.  Hard forks are part of the growing pains.  What do you mean?  
@_date: 2016-12-05 06:55:33
That's the great thing about ETH there is no scaling issue.  Only innovation and getting it done.  Yes that includes hard fork after fork until its working better than before - PROGRESS.  Bitcoin is becoming the Ice Age of crypto currency.  8 years and it can still only handle a 7 trans a sec.  Where's the scaling, lightening network and Web 3.0 and all the things Bitcoin promised to be in 2013?  I see only a very limited amount of growth in Bitcoin over the next few years and eventually the price going down.  The fact that nearly all of Bitcoin is controlled by the Chinese mining cartel and Blockstream who is CORE made me get out 100% this year.  So glad to be done with that mess.  Something else will come along sub-plant Bitcoin in time and this will be the reason why.

There's only one Bitcoin b/c of money's natural networking effect.  Its already more stable this year than last and even more so if you go back to 2011.  I am starting to agree Bitcoin is getting past the experimental phase.  OK so I will pump now and go ahead a say next year will be the rise to $2000 a coin.  The bear market is over in Bitcoin and now time for next Growth cycle in Price to catch up with the steady network growth we and seen last year and half.  The halving is incredibly bullish for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin needs to fix the scalability issues or we are all toast!  Who is going to wait 30 (approx. 3 hrs) confirmations when they pay at a brick and mortar store? I am not.

Gold is currently has a 6.8 Trillion $$$ Market Cap.  If Bitcoin takes only a sliver of Gold (1% to be exact), Bitcoin would have a 68 Billion $$$ Market Cap. So yeah if just 1 out of 100 Gold Bugs bought Bitcoin there would a huge increase in Bitcoin's Market Cap.  What I just mentioned Only scratches the surface if Bitcoin morphs into a Gold like asset.

Wait till it breaks ATH. All the naysayers claiming Bitcoin was dead last Fall, Winter &amp; Spring will have the chance to buy it at $1000+. These were close family &amp; friends who knew I was into Bitcoin. They were almost laughing at me out loud. Mind you not these were educated people. My respond to there ignorant comments were "no Bitcoin is not dead, there is no Bitcoin CEO and no one can stop it". In fact, Bitcoin has been growing; the transactions and adoption con't to grow. I told them all stop looking at the price and studying Bitcoin (how it works) just for a few hours. Buy something with Bitcoin. Well recently I cannot tell you how many of these same people have changed there minds on Bitcoin. I do want to say the big prices increases is what really excels the adoption curve of new users which intern stablizes high prices long term. So one and so forth Bitcoin is a self fulfilling prophecy! GLTA.

Good Investors buy and buy more if the assets value has down dramatically. The trick is the assets needs to survive and recover back to high prices long term.

Just like what was mentioned above.  Bitcoin cannot be controlled the way fiat money is.  The reason Bitcoin has caught on with Libertarians, Geeks and Finance people is b/c of its limited supply and decentralization.  You should look at Bitcoin as a Network of users.  Each time a new user buys/holds/transacts with Bitcoin, the network grows.  What you need to understand is that currency in and of itself has great networking effects. Wouldn't you say if the network (blockchain) con't to grow, the "tokens" that give it value go up in value?  Why would not we use another alt coin to "get in early"?  You can if you like but Bitcoin is the most stable and has all the Apps that give in value being built on top of it.  They don't and their prices are very unstable therefore limiting there intrensic value.  Bitcoin is backed by the free market system, silicon, hash power, math and so on.  Bitcoin is much more like digital gold than anything.  Remember the longest chain in Bitcoin wins. If you are trying double spend transactions, how would you expect the other miners to go along with your invalid chain? Bitcoin secures itself through consensus of the other miners trying to get the new bitcoins for verifying the transactions.  It takes 51% percent to gain control.  Good luck with that...LOL.  Its Bitcoin's Blockchain that is the biggest in computing power.  If you aren't with the consensus then you don't get the rewards which is currently 25 BTC for solving the puzzle.  Next year it drops to 12.5 BTC.  In turn that's puts buying pressure on Bitcoin.  In theory the price should con't to rise as Bitcoin as it becomes more useful (which increases the demand for the tokens) and the supply con't to decrease.  
@_date: 2015-07-25 08:37:37
The banks can do their own private blockchain but it would take about 5 years and about 30 billion bucks to do it. I am just quoting to you what Halsey Minor said from Bitreserve. IMO the price of Bitcoin matters very little when you are cloud banking.  People can choose whatever currency they want to hold but instantly send in BTC just like email - Instant Free, anywhere in the world.  Fedcoin really is going to be pointless when Bitcoin essentially Digitalized the USD and every other currency and commodity around the world.

The whole point of Bitcoin is decentralization.  Also, it makes little sense to build your own ledger when you can just build on top of Bitcoin's secure Blockchain.  Intranet vs. Internet in 94'.  Internet is open, so is Bitcoins protocol so anyone came build on top of it without permission.

Greece already defaulted on the IMF Friday June 30th.  This article is very poorly written. Of they will just kick the can down the road... the US is doing the same thing.  Its too painful to pay the debts so the gov't just keeps printing the money and adding to debts. It could be in 5 years or 20 but at some point there will be a Global debt crisis.  This may go on for years and years before people finally realize.  What most people don't understand is when you are the Central Bank - you unlimited printing powers.  ECB, FED, Japan, BOE - they all are the same.  Governments solution the Global debt problem is print more money.  The low income people and middle class ultimately pay the bill by steady dilution of there purchasing power.

Bitcoin will con't to grow as an new asset class.  Next summer this time will be past the ATH of $1200.  Likely around $2000 a coin after the halving.  In the Cloud Bitcoin banking services like Bitreserve will thrive and people will want to hold some of Bitcoin just as they do Gold or Silver.  These new systems of banking will bring new users and believers to the Bitcoin network.  Remember that to introduce new users to Bitcoin they will have the choice to use USD, GOLD, EURO or BTC.  The future of this type of banking is gigantic!  Bitcoin is the rail, it is the store of value and so many things, stocks bonds, contracts.  Bitcoin will be one of the best investments of a lifetime b/c of its limited supply and unlimited uses.  Those tokens we call Bitcoin could be anything of value Folks.  They will be worth a lot 10 years from now.

they will not freeze the Network. there high fees would feed the Bitcoin miners. This type attach would never last b/c it would be too expensive to maintain. If blocksize was increased this would not be an issue at all. The miners so would not "mind" some extra income. Maybe a few more cents more you would front run they spammer. instead a few cents it might cost you .06cents. Still way cheaper than credit cards! The spammer could never afford even 6 cents for a substained period of time, especially when blocksize is increase by even 1MB more.

Once it breaks $300, expect $400. Remember the Bear Whale was at $300 last fall and his order got chewed up and it shot to $400. IMO we are entering the next Bull Market in Bitcoin. THere should be 2 or 3 more boom and bust before it gets a high enough market cap to stablize. I mean like 10-15 flux a year. Studying the past cycles the next super bull in Bitcoin should take us to $10,000 or so. After this next run up expect at least a 50% drop. Judging from the past cycles, every time it gets less volatile. I would except the same next time.
@_date: 2016-02-07 00:28:54
Another note:  Even if there was a bad actor that took control of the network it would be very costly to do it and even more costly to maintain control.  If the computing power of the Bitcoin network continues it would take Billions and Billions of hardware.  Technically, its becoming impossible to do it even if you are the Government and had billions and billions to spend to take down the network.
@_date: 2015-07-10 12:55:46
would not that be nice. better yet there ETF gets approval. LT by next summer I truely believe the price will be much higher than $300. The having is extremely bullish for Bitcoin in 12 months.

@_date: 2015-07-03 23:37:57
it would have to be a terrorist group or gov't or big bank or someone who just wanted to destroy Bitcoin's value. If it was about profiting then this is a dumb idea, as the cost of maintaining a 51% double spend attach far out weigh just playing by the rules and making  $$$.  From what Andreas says, it would not take other miners long to kick the asshole off the network.  If there ever was a double spend attack, which is very unlikely at this point, it would only be for short window of time and value would drop temporary.  Maybe we are talking like ten minutes worth of transactions that could have been tampered with.  It's still way better than the current banking system. They can just whatever the hell they like if they wanted to.  Bitcoin IMO is the best form of money we have seen.  Just look at what's going on in Greece.  We have no control whatsoever if money is centralized. One turn of the switch and your money gone with the current system.

That would hard to believe since Bitcoin has such a long first mover advantage.  The Network effects of money are so great there's will likely Only be one major player longterm.  All the Apps are being built on Bitcoin's blockchain and not LTC Chain.  Hardly one.  If Bitcoin does well, probably so will Litecoin price.  I just think Bitcoin is a better Long term store of value than Litecoin.  Short term next 3 years who know LTC may do better than BTC since its so tiny.
@_date: 2016-02-07 00:23:21
So the Bitcoins are Peer to Peer.  The mining may be more centralized than we like but the currency itself is from wallet to wallet.  You either have to convert fiat or mine it.  Long as other miners can mine Bitcoins the system is safe.  Even if those miners are bigger and bigger operations does not matter.  If the majority of the computing power is controlled by honest nodes the system is good.  You may end up with major corporations competing against each other to mine Bitcoins but that does not mean the system is flawed and cannot be trusted.  Also, I believe the IOT will help decentralize the mining later on. There are ways of making mining more distributed for sure.
@_date: 2015-07-09 23:43:00

You nailed it with the trusted 3rd parties in Gold storage.  That's the problem with Gold right there.  I believe Bitcoin also has a much higher upside than Gold.  True Gold may be more stable but as more people use Bitcoin so will its value rise.  Over the last 5 years if we would have put just a tiny fraction of wealth into Bitcoin you'd be sitting on a huge return.  The same cannot be said for Gold returns of the last 5 years.

Yes, now is the perfect time.  Try and get it under $300.  Bitcoin just broke its long term bear trend line in the 260's.  We have a confirmed breakout so I would expect the price to go up and test $300 very soon.  Remember the Bear Whale at $300 last Oct. or so?  Once its breaks $300 expect $500.  Its better to buy it on the way up instead of trying to pick the bottom.  Cost avg. is very smart thing to do.  This time I would not wait around.  The price is steady moving up now and has a confirmed breakout.  Bitcoin is like that you know.  Everybody on board and it moves one way or the other.  Although the price is much more stable than in the past, longterm it still has a massive upside if transactions/adoption con't to increase.

the transactions fees just could go higher for legit transactions. It would cost him a fortune to keep spamming long periods of time without those little micro fees.

Which is why just over the last two years virtually anyone in the US can buy Bitcoins now.  This was not true in 2012.  The only way to buy Bitcoins 2-3 years ago was GOX.  In the 2-3 more years Bitcoin will be ready for the masses.  Look how far its come and look at how far we'll all be going.  Over the next few years Grandma could use it.  Remember the Internet was the same way until year 99'.  Email in 95' was terrible!  Bitcoin is probably in year 96-97'.

Most people who have Bitcoin are both speculating and supporting an alternative currency that in all ways is superior to that of the Governments.  You make a good point Bitcoin volatility a major hurdle but as the market and liquidity grows the price will stablize.  Also, there are companies out there starting to offer to send you funds in Bitcoin while hold it in fiat.  Its not as cheap as Bitcoin to Bitcoin but its better than Western Union.

The average person should stay away till it is proven but it does not mean we cannot filly diddle with our own personal funds being fully aware of the risk.  Warren also never bought any shares of Apple b/c he cannot accurately predict cash flow and its the same with almost all tech companies.  He would not be the type of investor to buy Bitcoin via Berkshir; moreover he does not buy gold in any large scale.  Bitcoin is like many things in one but its main asset class is like Gold (longterm store of value) and its a payment rail system that moves money around the world.  Bitcoin is very much high tech and commodity based.  Its the first of its kind so it takes longer for most people (especially 85 year olds to get it).

He's saying at some future point if the current trends continue the demand of Bitcoin will out strip supply.  Supply of Bitcoin is decreasing while users are increasing.  Who's selling?  Who really knows?  Probably the miners paying for their bills.  Next year when the supply of BTC halves that may be just enough to get the swing going back to Bull.  We are Only 14 months away from the halving and about that same time the 400 million+ dollars of VC backing into Bitcoin will have its full effect of usefulness.  IMO its going to get interesting EOY and especially into next year.  Judging from Bitcoin's previous cycles it would not be far out to see a 20x from these lows.  In the past it went up 50X to 100X from a bear market low to ATH three different times but I am playing conservative considering possibility Bitcoin is less volatile.  A 20x from here puts it at $4400 a coin.  I think its reasonable in 2 years the price is around $5000 a coin.
@_date: 2015-04-06 12:42:21
To make it clear investments in Bitcoin are setting up for another record year.  Its possible to hit 1 billion by year end.  "buttercoin" for one had the wrong name - is it an alt coin or what?  They should of changed they name but that's not the only reason.  The timing was off in an already saturated fiat to bitcoin market.  Plus, there product no advantage over anyone else's.  IMO services like Align Commerce will flourish b/c they are solving business problems.
@_date: 2015-04-06 03:26:40
Its a no brainer to most people who understand stocks but the bigger the market cap always the smoother the price.  If you look at Exxon Mobile or Walmart for example you'll see over long periods of time they will flux but usually no more than 15% a year.  Its impossible for Bitcoin to be stable currently b/c almost anyone with $100,000 on hand can move the price.  Once Bitcoin gets up around a $40 Billion market cap this will not be an issue.  This is why along with the security of the mining their will Only be a few coins that survive in the longterm.  Its mostly a winner take all senario.  Sure another alt coin may be better but can it gain the market cap of Bitcoin to become stable.  The answer is mostly no.  Bitcoin has the best chance to make it years from now b/c the Protocol can be alter enough to evolve if needed.  Its my belief that $10,000 a coin will come very fast when it happens.  Now at some future point 5 years or so we should see the price really smooth out.  Just going back to the previous 6 years of Bitcoins existence you can see by looking up on the volatility chart it smoothing out already.  Although, the currency is no where near the point of stable, if the current 6 year trend continues, 4-5 more years it should stablize very well.  15 more years it could be stable as gold or better, conservatively speaking.
@_date: 2015-04-14 13:36:06
I will gain traction but it will take time.  I believe with two more years it will be.  Bitcoin has a very big image problem at the moment.  What I mean is for the ones who researched it and took the time to understand it we get it, its the future.  But for the ones reading mainstream headlines they don't get it yet and think its some sort of scam.  Even though this year Bitcoin related companies likely to raise 900 million by top VC investors they still believe its a bubble or a fad that is going away.  Clearly, it is not!  The entire Bitcoin eco-system is growing by the minute!

@_date: 2015-04-14 16:12:23
Its depressing but there's not much you can do.  IMO if you truely believe in Bitcoin's longterm success you should turn your computer off and don't look at the price.  Give it 2 more years, then see where you are at.  If you cannot sleep at night b/c you have to much invested, I recommend that you sell until your at a level that you feel comfortable with losing.  Bitcoin is still a very high risk, high reward investment.  If it becomes an alternative currency used by only 10-20% of the world's population we are looking at the market cap to be up around $40 billion and the price per coin to be at $10,000 or more.  IMO there's no reason to be selling unless the VC investments and transactional volume start to decrease.  This year there's going to be over 600 million invested in the Bitcoin eco-system and at some point all of that investment will create user friendly Apps that the masses can use.  I am just saying we all may be down right now but in a couple more years Bitcoin may be very useful and the price much higher than the 200's.  Honestly, I cannot see myself selling under $10,000 I believe in the longterm value prop so strongly.  I realise that on paper my investment may drop further but given some more time this paper loss likely will turn into great gains down the road.  Its hard to do but we all must give it another couple of years before we can start judging.  Its a likely total loss of investment or 1000x return.  With Bitcoin it either gets adapted or not. Win a lot or lose 99%. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 02:26:03
Yes, I too have lost money on my Bitcoin investments but I don't consider it a lost b/c my time horizon is 5 years and I have only been invested for 1 and half years.  Initially, I was trying to buy before bubble and almost got GOXED but it smelled fishy so I never made that wire transfer.  Would of made a ton of money then lost it in Feb. 2014.  Now I am holding losses from cost avg. in the low 400's.  I am not upset but disappointed I did not wait to buy in lower.  Although I have lost of half my money in Bitcoin I cannot find any reason to sell it.  I will give it 2-3 years and then see.  Its still to early to tell and I see by next year the price back over ATH for many reasons.  Yes, Bitcoin can never be adapted but its unlikely with the backing it continues to get from VC's.  At some future point the price has to catch up! 
@_date: 2015-04-09 12:41:31
Bitshares does what you are talking about.  You are right most people don't want the burden of worrying about the price.  Until volatility calms down most people not going to hold Bitcoins.  Companies like Bitreserve have the right idea by sending in Bitcoin but hold the money in fiat.  I see the Only way to mass adaption is by a dencentralized pegging system where you are sending your money as Bitcoin but in the process of holding its in fiat.  I really don't know any of technical details about it but its the Only way Bitcoin will be used as payments at least in the Developed countries.

Bitcoin is a better store value than the USD longterm.  As a currency Bitcoin really sucks right now (market cap still too small) but it depends with which other currency you are comparing it to.  The Brazilian Real for example this year is doing much worst than Bitcoin.  Bitcoin adoption in Brazil has great traction b/c of that.  I think you'll see Bitcoin flourish, first in countries that are having the biggest inflation problems.  As Bitcoin grows in size so will it be more and more stable.  If you are speculator you are not going to make money if Bitcoin is very stable.  This is still a great time to buy Bitcoin before the next adoption wave and the increase in price.  Also, its not healthy to think Bitcoin will go to the moon tomorrow.  Think 10 to 20 years of adoption.
@_date: 2015-09-22 19:18:39
yes, but a lot of people aren't as savy as you or me.  they just want to push a button and have it work everytime.  Circle is super way of doing it without having to worry what the price bitcoin is doing.  one day bitcoin will be stable enough for everyone, we are just not there yet.

Bitcoin is many things.  Blockchain the value transfer system does not exist without the currency Bitcoin.  In the future, Bitcoin will go mainstream in many ways both two major ones that are obvious are Bitcoin the store of value - independent from Government and Bitcoin as a payment rails system that other currencies and anything else of value rides on top of.  But let's be clear - the mainstream is not going to use Bitcoin as the currency for many more years until its proven stable.  However, as a payment rail they will start using it very soon.  Dollars to Bitcoin - Bitcoin to Dollars.  Bitcoin's value will go up for many reasons but the most will come from a Gold Asset like class you can send anywhere in the world instantly.

Yeah it's great they take Bitcoin but what's the incentive to pay with it?  Credit Cards give you 1% cash back and I just talked to CardCash about giving folks a Bitcoin discount  (3-5%) since they have 0 chance of fraud and no processing fees with Bitcoin and they said no.  Give us the discount code CardCash like CardFlip and I'll gladly spend my Bitcoins there! :-)
@_date: 2015-04-09 03:12:48

@_date: 2015-09-27 22:06:38
Exactly.  Most people will not even really know there are using Bitcoin but does it really matter?  I think Bitcoin acts as Store of Value and Payment Rail.  There's no way the mainstream is using Bitcoin for payments due to its volatility.  In time Bitcoin will become a great and stable currency 10+ years but for now services like Circle's USD wallet will get us there and start to onboard the millions to Blockchain.

You can't tell me Bitcoin does not have a huge Networking Effect!  Look at the Transactional Volume and Price Stability.  Every year the transaction volume grows while believe this or not the volatility goes down.  Bitcoin is becoming more stable and therefore more useful as money.  Does this mean a steady rise and pop past $1000 to $10000 a coin then once again another drop?  The volatility chart suggest that this is likely.  Every year the boom and bust get more and more smooth!  To me its acting perfectly eventually be a store of value and currency.  What do you guys think?

Bitcoin public ledger is what keeps it safe.  If there every was a problem the ledger would still be perfectly accurate by its time stamps.

It would be impossible b/c the CFTC ruled it as a commodity.  Its treated like Gold according to their ruling.  Asking this question is like asking like how would they stop Gold and the Internet?  Bitcoin is a little of both.  They will never be able to stop it.  From what we have been seeing over last 2 years most Governments respond very neutral to Bitcoin.  It would be different it a certain country or bank own Bitcoin but no one controls it or can own it entirely.  This is the beauty of Bitcoin.  The banks are the ones who stand the most to lose and some of the banks are smart enough to embrace this new tech before they get total disrupted out of business.  JP Morgan is one of the Only Banks who have not made an Bitcoin Blockchain investment and they'll be one the first to go.  Dimon is totally ignorant of this tech.

Buffet does not invest in Gold either.  Companies will outperform in general.  Buffet looks for companies with reasonable or undervalued valuations.  Just like Gold there's really no way to truly value it.  I am long on Bitcoin but I would never risk more than 20% of my funds.  Bitcoin is my ultimate "smart gamble".  It took me so long to ever buy it but once I understood how powerful and how many user will soon use the Network I realized its a great bet.  I still think if the volatility issue does not get solved next few years Bitcoin will die.  It at least needs to be headed towards the stability of Gold.

Contrary to what you just said, Visa is testing on Bitcoin Blockchain for remittance.  They gave many reasons why they choose the Bitcoin Blockchain and why they are using Bitcoin companies that buy and sell Bitcoin in the background to make the remittance.  Your right some companies are trying the private blockchains for certain uses.  Like today we have Intranets and Internets.  Bitcoin will become the big Internet of Money.  Without Bitcoin or any crypto-currency its nothing more than a distruptied data base.  These private blockchains do not allow for open innovation like the Bitcoin Blockchain.  Look at all the companies building Apps on Bitcoin Blockchain.  No private blockchain will ever come close.  Good luck getting all the banks to work together to make the private blockchain scale properly.  Its Only a matter a time before the bank developers get hired to work on building out the Bitcoin Blockchain b/c it allows for open innovation.

decentralized exchanges and market places are the solution.  in this way no one entity has control over the funds.  multi-sig of course is the answer.  all of this needs to be built in automatically.  like sorry to say but there is some regulation needed.  i believe bitshares and openbazaar are two examples of what's needed.  from what i understand they are both still in beta but in the meantime idiots will still be losing their money.  this is the type of thing that really hurts bitcoin.  its like leaving money out on the street in a unlocked box.  eventually somebody's going to take it!

Fair value to the mining of Bitcoin should put the price at $500 a coin before the halving.  Fair value after halving if demand remains constant is $1000 a coin.  IMO and from what Webbush published the price of Bitcoin is still undervalued.  If the adoption of Bitcoin con't to steadily pick up, then expect the demand for coins to pick up causing an upwards pressure on the price of coins.  Its a no brainer.  If Bitcoin continues gaining traction thought the world expect $2000-$3000 a coin over the next year or two.

There's haters b/c they don't understand it and think it a fraud.  The ones who take the time and understand Bitcoin are its biggest believers.  Ask me 2 years ago about Bitcoin something I never even heard of about they way I felt about it would have been competely different than the way I feel about it now.  For most people even if they put in the time and have an open mind it takes 6 months for it to really sink in how big this is really going to be and why each Bitcoin can potenially be worth $40,000 or more a coin.  To almost any newby it looks like one big huge bubble on the verge of collapse until you understand the fundamentals of how Bitcoin really works.  Until mass adaption happens Bitcoin the currency does have a chance of failure.  Not b/c of Bitcoin but b/c humans are so hard to change.  Although as time goes by and new useful apps are created on top of Bitcoin to get it user friendly this could no longer be a threat.

Or you could use up and coming services like Bitreverse to hold Gold (which has been proven to be a great store of value longterm) and pay for shit in Bitcoin or BitGold using Bitcoin as the medium.  I think the Store of Value issue is by far the most influential on the price of Bitcoin but let us not forget in order to be a great store of value Bitcoin needs to be liquid enough to get into.  100k transactions a day is micro!  You need Bitcoin to be Store of Value, Medium of Exchange and Internet Money (better than the fraud and high fees of credit cards).  Let's us not forget Satoshi mentioned the latter specifically as a use case for Bitcoin.  I don't know about you but I feel more and more safe using and hold Bitcoins.  I been a user for almost 2 years.

Manner is right, for Bitcoin to go mainstream the user should not have to worry about the volatility risk.  All they care about is that their funds are going from point A to point B cheaper, faster and safer than the Legacy banking system.  They really don't care about understanding it or even need to know they are using Bitcoin.  Like most people don't know how the Internet protocol works neither will they the Bitcoin Protocol.  Why is Bitcoin valuable b/c it will move the dollars around much cheaper, faster, safer than paper bills can.  With Bitcoin everything builds on itself b/c its open sourced.  Bitcoin is going to succeed b/c anyone with an idea can build on top of it - unlike Ripple.  It cost nothing to accept Bitcoin and its easy to accept.  Unlike credit cards and other closed systems.  Bitcoin's open nature is why it will become massively successful.

Circle.com USD wallets are incredible.  I don't believe they're are available in Canada yet but with just the push of a button the money is sent in USD instantly!  I can't wait till they expand and Bitreserve goes live.  This new form of Cloud Banking using the Blockchain is just amazing.  Bitcoin the currency is also great, I am just saying sometimes you just want to pay someone without having to worry about the price changing too much.  Bitcoin as it grows, I believe will be better than the dollar but for now I like the USD wallet when I am paying for goods or services.

The Fedcoin if ever developed would make Bitcoin more successful.  Here's why.  First, it would as you already said bridge the gap b/t fiat and Bitcoin.  It would make incredibly easy to switch b/t the two.  The "Fedcoin" would still be control be the Fed and its unlimited minting capabilities so in the end Fedcoin does not solve the Long Term store of value problem that Bitcoin does.  We all know how fiat eventually ends with unlimited printing power.  Moreover, the Fedcoin would make Bitcoin more successful.  Just think if a tiny fraction of the wealth from the USD was stored in Bitcoin.  We are talking easy $40,000+ a coin here.  I would love to see Fedcoin.  For a while it may be much less volatile than Bitcoin but over time it would make Bitcoin more stable.  Eventually, 20 years or more Bitcoin could possibly be more stable than Fedcoins.  For the long term store of value problem Bitcoin just needs to consistently go up over time.  From what I have ready there are BitUSD being developed so by the time Fedcoin finally comes along it may be late.  Eventually, the USD has to go digital b/c it makes logical sense.  However, I in no know seeing killing Bitcoin b/c again its centralized and controlled by the Feds.  The biggest downfall I see to Fedcoin would that developers cannot build on top of it.  Bitcoin will eventually smooth out in price volatility once all these super cool Apps get layered on top.  I mean who ever could have imagined Facebook, Uber, Amazon and Bitcoin in 93'.  Going back to your specific question "what are the benefits to Fedcoin" I will list them clearly.  1.  Increases Bitcoin adaption by easy of transfer 2.  Its obvious that if you are using these Fedcoins (digital dollars) Bitcoin would seem that much more familiar to use and that alone would give Bitcoin a boost of new users  3.  Hedging is a big one and it probably could fit under easy of transfer.  However, its important b/c let's say another type of crisis breaks out.  We'll we already now what the Feds we do - print more Fedcoins!  Everybody runs over to Bitcoin just like Gold in 09' but this time its Gold 2.0 where everyone can transact anywhere in the world.  Now the bigger question is will the Feds policy still be effective when there's an alt currency that goes up in value longterm while at the same time being a payment protocol.  My best guess is eventually over time the masses will learn to trust Bitcoin the Currency much more than Fedcoins.  So in the end Fedcoin helps Bitcoin gain acceptance.  Go Fedcoin…LOL!

Bitcoin still has the "bad smell" from the media's mis-understanding.  GOX probably set the adoption back by at least one year but it made good Bitcoin companies better.  As of late you see the mainstream starting to think more highly of Bitcoin, as its still here and its not a SCAM.  This next run will likely start soon and last longer than the last several.  Every wave up in price increases the adoption of Bitcoin drastically.  $10,000 a coin could happen much sooner than most think the way the infrastructure is being built out.

What could very likely happen is a side chain develops using USD, pegged to Bitcoin.  Basically, this would allow dollars to be sent and verified by the Blockchain.  Bitcoin would still remain the underlying currency that fuels the miners.  Basically, could send a micro transaction in BTC but attach dollars to it or stocks, whatever.  I know there's already companies that do this like Bitshares but there different ways to send dollars using blockchain.  Blockchain itself will not exist without bitcoin the currency.  So it makes sense to own bitcoins for long term store of value, much like Gold.

Over time this will likely outperform any growth stock.  Bitcoin = AMZN charts.  Bitcoin is not a company but its similar b/c its the miners currency.  If the network keeps growing like it has in past the price of bitcoin with 3 years will easily be at $10,000.  If it starts taking away some of Gold's 8 trillion market cap.... watch out!  The Winklevoss twin may be right long term $40,000 - $100,000 a coin.  If not for that long term store of value potential I would never hold Bitcoin.  BitUSD better than Bitcoin for a currency.  Bitcoin will likely be used in developing countries as in independent currency alt but its likely not going to be used on a massive scale in Brick and Motor stores.  Internet currency like what OpenBazaar is trying to do... there it has a use case.  But not in stores Digital Dollars not far away.  Longterm store of value like Gold 2.0.  OK there's a use case.  Micropayments, developing countries currency, e-commerce, stocks, contracts.

So far it looks they have some of the cheapest fees:
What are the fees for trading on Gemini?
To enable us to continue to operate Gemini, each Order placed on Gemini is typically subject to a fee (“Fee”) that is generally assessed as a percentage of Order size (i.e., price * size) and charged in U.S. Dollars (“USD”). The Fee is currently equal to 0.25%, but we reserve the right to change, modify or increase this Fee at any time and require you to confirm that you are aware of such changes prior to submitting an Order. We will update this Agreement to reflect any change in the Fee. Your use of Gemini following any update to this Agreement is considered to be your acceptance of any such changes. For limit orders that have not completely filled, a Fee will be charged only on the portion of a given limit order that has filled. Fees are paid by both buyer and seller on any given Order. NOTE: Fees and account balances are not rounded, even though they may be displayed to you as rounded up or down to the smallest denomination for a given fiat currency or Digital Asset (e.g., one penny, one satoshi).

What you said is not true.  Uphold uses Bitcoin to make stable value transfer possible.  You can hold in BTC if you choose but most people I know don't want to worry about the price going up and down.  There's no fucking way Bitcoin goes mainstream (in the longterm) without being a payment rail first.  Bitcoin can be considered to be like a frontier currency at this point and by no means is ready for trillions of bucks to sit on.

The Bitcoin price increases in the past caused an even higher demand for the coin that leads a whole new wave of adoption.  Studying the history of Bitcoin, we can see that there has been 4 major rallies in BTC price.  After each major upswing was complete the drawdowns are less and less dramatic.  If the trend continues within 5 to 8 years Bitcoin will be stable enough not to change in to fiat.  It's true potential will be "unleashed" and you'll see a vibrant world economy like you have never seen or imagined before.

it links back inputs and outputs all the way back to the genius block to verify all transactions balance.  its no different than a t-ledger in accounting with debits and credits.  I probably over simplified this but basically that's how it works.  I have thought about many times how the Blockchain could be taken down by a double spending attack but even if that were to happen it would Only be temporary as the cost of doing a double spend would far outweigh the rewards for mining.  Even if there was a bug in the system it could be re-booted long as there was many copies of the ledger.  the way Blockchain is secured and the way it is distributed of all computers makes it ever lasting IMO.  I give it a 90% chance this will survive in the future and become a mainstream alternative payment system to the legacy system.  the apps built on top of Bitcoin must be more user friendly and if that never happens you can give the kiss of death to bitcoin at least as a currency.  I cannot stress that part enough b/c currently at least in the developed world there is little reason for you average Joe to go out an buy/use Bitcoin.  It must become more user friendly to survive.  Its the same stage as the Internet in 93' and 94'.  The average person saw no real use in the Internet.  Facebook in the beginning was the same way.  For Bitcoin it would not take much more user and better apps for the mainstream adaption to start occurring.  Within 5 years if it does take off its dead and will be worth near to nothing... back to Nerd money.  But I see the chances of that happening very slim at this point.

We always give anyone paying with Bitcoin 5% off!!!  Brick and mortar there is not a huge advantage accepting Bitcoin except that you can save on fees and offer your clients a discount for it.  Online Bitcoin really starts to shine.  I think once Openbazaar.org gets up and running it will totally disrupt companies like Amazon and Ebay.  Openbazaar.org is totally free.  That would a paradise for small business selling across the global.  i truly believe Openbazaar or something like it will develop it one of Bitcoin's Killer Apps.  Do you know how much Amazon takes off in fees?  A min. 8% and depends on the item 15%, plus you got another 5% that goes to chargebacks and process fees.  The merchants are losing 12% to 20% off their profit margins!  Sometimes that was there entire profit margin!  Openbazaar.org is going to be amazing and it will be a perfect reason to use Bitcoin.

They thought Bitcoin was dead.  Now as of recently, they started to realize, Hey Bitcoin is there and they keep hearing about.  Now I got 2 of those peeps to go out a buy Bitcoin.  Another way I got 5 newbies in was Changetip.  But you need to tip them $10 or more b/c they will not go collect it if its like .50 cents.  Anyway I believe we are that critical point where the skeptics start turn into believers and even better some of those are going out to buy it.

The true cost of accepting Credits in store are about 3%-4% in store and 4%-5% Online.  You'll have hidden international exchange rate fees if the card is from over seas and there are always a certain amount of charge backs that will happen in any business if you accept credit cards.  People have figure out to just charge back the business, while the customer thinks its 'free' all the while the business has to raise the prices as people pay more and more with credit cards.  Yeap the fees are include and its not Free!  Customer ends up paying for it in the end!

Long term its deflationary, so if you just buy it and hold its safer.  The question still remains will it be here in 10 years.  I think with great certainty the answer is yes but there's a chance of never it never taking off globally and it dies.  However, with the investments and Apps being built on top of it that would be very unlikely.  Its even less likely Bitcoin would fail in a systematic way meaning a bug or other technical difficulty.  Long as we have the agreed upon consenses  ledger the system could fork over and techinically reboot itself.  This type of failure is extremely unlikely, although if it did happen or a double spending attack it would be brief and the system could restore itself.

There's just no sign of this slowly down and once we get the Bitlicens out it gives the green light on Bitcoin!  Funny how its Bitlicense and not crypto currency license or some other shit.

In a Free market robust economy the tide lifts all boats - yes even the poor and weak b/c the standard of living is brought up and there is more opportunity for the weak to rise up and become strong.

Nope, its not that at all.  It will be so incredibly seemless the user would not know.  To send or receive payments it would be done the same way with the Bitcoin addresses but the user would decide if they wanted there funds instantly pegged to the US Dollar.  When they are ready to spend the system auto converts and sends funds out in BTC.  As Bitcoin develops more users will opt to stay in bitcoin currency.  95% of people don't want the exposure to it price changes so this IMO cheaply brings the stability of the dollar to the third world with the benefits of crypto.

I agree US stocks are in another bubble.  Dow may hit 18500 to 19000 before correcting but its coming.  The Feds will have to raise interest rates and we they do the stock market bubble pops.  I do see a huge upside in commodities b/c they been literally beaten into the ground and global growth will return, so I am extremely bullish there and in Europe - especially beaten up Eurozone countries like Greece and Spain.  Speaking about Bitcoin, the risk/reward is so great I could never pass on this opportunity before us.  I went through it a thousand's times how many ways it could fail but as the the prices kept coming down I kept buying more, as I kept doing my DD about how the Blockchain works.  Yes, it could fail but I believe its unlikely.  If this works it will be the greatest investment we ever made and will ever make.  I don't know exactly where the price is going but if the VC and adoption keeps pouring around Bitcoin's Blockchain the currency bitcoin must go up in value substantially.

The Free Market will prevail in the end.  It all started years ago in the 6th B.C Athens and has not stopped to grow all throughout modern history.  Bitcoin is the next step in liberation.  The competitive free markets are the tide that lifts all boats, poor or rich.

Jeremy is all about Bitcoin.  What do you really think the masses are ready to be storing all their wealth holding Bitcoin?  This answer is no way!  You need to first show them the benefits of Free, Instant, Global money.  Then later once we get to a much larger market cap and maturity.  Then the people can start putting some of their longterm holdings into Bitcoin.  You got to be absolutely insane if you think Bitcoin (the currency) is ready for the world.  Its not!  First we need Circle, Uphold and others to have a way to circumvent the banks.  Then will get the Bitcoin the currency to a Global Reserve Currency.

Bubble??? Folks we are no where near a "Bubble" yet - $2,500 to $3,000 by end of year would be another Bubble.  This is nothing for Bitcoin.  A lot of you must be new to Bitcoin?  You can barely still see the green bars rising on a long term chart.

love it!  you are absolutely right!  In a way to be successful as an investor you need to somewhat Contra to the masses.  Not the point of disillusion but to the point where you can go through a process and say OK, whatever it is that you are looking at investing in has this amount of chance of success and set a realistic timeframe.  So many people just go with whatever others think.  In the case of Bitcoin they are still comparing it as 'shady' and it will 'go away soon'.  Its 'a fad'.  Now if we closely examine Bitcoin you will see it is not going away and has real potential to become a major currency.  Don't always go with the crowd b/c many times the crowd it wrong (even more so with investing)  One reason you have so many successful Value Investors is that they usually go against the general agreement in the crowd and spot the opts that are right in front of everyone else's eyes.

Also, the later in system you arrive the more trust Bitcoin has so the higher the price you must pay to have access to this stability.  Think of it like a Blue Chip stock.  Coco-Cola for example, is very stable stock now but the first 20 years it was not.  During the Great Depression it went way down.  Over the long term it way up but the beginning is volatile with lots of ups and downs.  Bitcoin is no different than any other new asset class.  Oil was also very very volatile when it was first discovered and traded.  At that time there was no automobile and little demand for it besides heating.  Give Bitcoin 2 more years and it will be crystal clear the use cases.

In 20 years Bitcoin will be big as the Internet itself.  There will be alt coins that develop but Bitcoin and its sidechains will dominate the Global value transfer system.  In money as we all know it huge networking effects work like this.  You accept Bitcoin?  Now merchant says what's Bitcoin?  Explain, Oh!  What's happening as time goes by more and more people have Bitcoin which makes more and more other people accept Bitcoin.  The chicken and eggs problem finally is overcome simply b/c of its Network effect of Scale and Size not to mention all this leads to price stability.  Soon it will be everywhere just like email.  First in the developing world and remittance.  Where Bitcoin solves the basic problems first will be adaption!  Welcome to Bitcoin!

It will never go mainstream without pairing it to the dollar in the users wallets.  Bitcoin and the dollar should would strengthen each other when they co-exist.  Why would anyone use Bitcoin now?  I mean the average person.  They are not trying to rich off of price speculation and they cannot afford the value going way down in a week.  I think once the smart wallets come out it will help the price of Bitcoin in a huge way b/c it will bring so many more users into the ec0-sytem!  Over time they will start holding BTC just like you and me!

The reason Nabster failed b/c it had centralized servers.  Bitcoin is not centralization and the ledger is everywhere so in the worst of all worst cases this ledger could be transferred a new Blockchain and the protocol rebooted if the miners agreed to do it.  Remember, these miners have more skin in the game than its users so they have no incentive to destroy Bitcoin.  Even if someone were to gain over 50% control does not mean they would start to double spend.  In fact, that's already happen before and there was no issues.  These small block chains you can easy take them out but with a double spending attack. Bitcoin it will take millions of millions of dollars and very soon as the difficulty increases it will take Billions.  No other block chain is even close to having this amount of security by its computing power.  For security reasons Bitcoins Blockchain will be used as side chains could run on it as well for faster lighter transactions!

I like your post but I don't think Bitcoin ATM's are necessary.  You can just download Coinbase or Cirlce's App into your phone, link your credit card or bank account and your done.  Although, some people like to see "things" like psychical ATM machine can help adoption in your town but me personally I would have no use for that.  In fact, I never have once used a ATM machine.  I have a hair salon in Miami so I know exactly what they are dealing with when it comes to the credit card companies.  Its a nightmare, especially if you start getting chargebacks!  When you go back next time to cut your hair tell your stylist to accept Bitcoin via Bitpay.  They have over 50,000 merchants already signed up and growing fast!  That's who we use.  Tell her its free for them, if the total is $20 you actually get $20.  I did notice on the costumer side they is a very small fee that is added in the bill.  For example, when I paid a $5 bill Bitpay was charging me the customer $5.05.  I would guess that's the spread and how they make a little money there.  But just tell her its Free b/c it is for the Merchant at least.  The funds get settle into the merchants bank account the next couple of business days!  Also, let her know they is no risk to it.  Its the same as if someone walked in a paid cash.  It takes 5 min. for the merchant to sign up with an account at Bitpay.  Bitpay verifies your ID then you add where you want your funds to settle to and that's it!  It's incredibly easy.  I have debt with SHopify, Paypal, AMEX, Visa, and many more payment companies and I can say there have hidden fees and many will suddenly hold funds or make policy changes leaving you delayed money, less money and the chargebacks are always settled in the customers favor, even if you did nothing wrong.  A client per say can simply be dissatisfied and AMEX will charge the merchant back for the entire service!  Tell them once the accept Bitcoin with Bitpay to list there business on coin map.org and get more clients!

Wait until mass adoption occurs.  You're not ready for it.  Its volatile b/c its new.  Once it levels out in 5 years buy it then.  Although the upside from then could be limited at least you waited and play it more safe.  
@_date: 2015-02-21 00:52:38
I agree.  I think its going back to the old highs and once it breaks, the new bubble will start (probably to $5000 or $10000 or some round number)  current 3 billion market cap is very low.  I think every time we go through this hype cycle two things happen.  The value becomes more stable and b/c the price went high it attracts new adopters.
@_date: 2015-02-01 09:34:51
To make it clear.  The consumer will still pay in Bitcoin but rather than having the BTC converted instantly into the merchant's bank account USD the beneficiary will have an option to pair with a BitUSD in their wallet and when they are ready convert back into Bitcoin to spend it where accepted.  This is huge in two ways.  Bitcoins never leave the Crypto-World and second it requires no bank account.  This will enable the third world to leap frog into Bitcoin over banking the same way they did with land phones to wireless.  We should have these first new way of smart wallets by this year.

Bitcoin is going mainstream but slowly.  It takes time for people to get comfortable with this.  All you hear in the news is about Silk Road and the Mt. GOX collapse, its no wonder people have the wrong idea about it.  Also, remember the Financial Crisis 08' media made stocks look like rat poison but in the end these moments have proven to be the best time to buy.  Bitcoin will have its time in glory but first it needs a reputational makeover.  Smart VC's already get it and so will the masses eventually.

My first experience with Bitcoin was in Sept of 2013.  It finally caught my eye once I took the time out one day to study it - I was hooked!  So then I was like where to buy it???  All roads at that time pointed to Mt. Gox, so I sent them over the application and it took them 6 weeks to approve me.  By then I was like WTF???  Forget about this shady shit.  That was about the time the price started climbing in Oct.  Shit!  It went to $500 before I found out about Coinbase!  By then I was forget about this I am not chasing this up like a fool.  Anyway last summer the price went back down to $600 thinking I was getting in cheap and been buying all the way down b/c I know this is going back past its all time highs.  Good luck!

Greece will not leave to Euro.  Its too expensive and risky.  I know that would be great for Bitcoin but it will not happen.  Greece by all measures is extremely undervalued with a Cape P/E Ratio of 3!  In the US you must 26 dollars for one 1 of earnings now and there its just 3 bucks!  Buying Greece now is like buying into 1933 in the depths of the Great Depression.  They are the root of civilization and its used to be a decent place to invest.  I am not saying they are without problems but Spain and Greece is about to make a big recovery!

most people wait and buy when the price is going up not when its sold off or selling off.  the high return drawn more users in and the cycle repeats.  that's what a free market system is all about.  Winners and losers.  Long term is provides us with tremendous long term growth.  In the "wild west" 1800's America grew more then by defintion than any other period.  It was a period of boom and bust cycles... Yes the true free market system was in place and it made America what it is today.  The problem today is the central bank and all the middle man in between.  Very soon we will enter the golden age of technology and the free market will once again be able to prevail.

Bitcoin and Fiat will Co-Exist.  Bitcoin is a long term store of value much like Gold.  Since Bitcoin is much faster and cheaper to send than Gold, it will bit more into Gold's Market Cap as its more competition to Gold rather than the USD.  Bitcoin and Gold are both deflationary on a long term basis, meaning there will always be bubble and bust cycles.  In the end, on a long term chart I would expect Bitcoin to have the same problems as Gold has as a store of value.  It is not the perfect solution but the best man has.  Let me ask you in another way, would you rather put your money in Gold or USD if you had to park it there for 20 years?  The answer will be Gold of course.  Bitcoin has the same longterm store of value but b/c its new the upside is much greater than Gold's.  Bitcoin is more useful than Gold b/c its solves many problems than making shinny jewerly.  You will see it take off first in the Remittance market, then your going to see it in micro-payments and they e-commerce.  Eventually, 10-15 years once it proves itself as a store of value you'll see the largest increase of value come from store of value.  Easily will see $40,000 a coin over the next 20 years due to investors parking money long term in the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-02-23 23:07:01
Brain, is right.  What makes Bitcoin secure is its size and scale.  Why not use the blockchain as the value transfer network and build side chains around it?  Crypo-currenices are already volatile enough much less the smaller ones that have masses liquidity and security problems.  I'll just stay with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-01 10:01:01
I know what you are saying, but your average person does not want the value of there money to change a lot from day to day.  I have no doubt Bitcoin will be worth much more in the future but they don't look at it that way.  A user friendly pairing to the BitUSD in your wallet would be a beautiful solution.  Users could et there limits like, 30% keep in Bitcoin and the rest of funds goes directly into BitUSD till they are ready to spend.
