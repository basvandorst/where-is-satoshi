States in their current shape and form have changed in a sense that there are people, quite a large percentage, that are not happy with it. Further, many of the laws of the state are subjective and not reasonable in a sense that there are many things that are not moral yet are legal. Bitcoin is first serious attempt to the post-state society. There was internet, then file sharing, then private-public key cryptography, however btc allows unprecedented freedom ... stateless money.

Bitcoin is stored in open air in the vast mathematical array as a very large number that is impractical to guess. Anyone who knows the number (the private key) can manage associated values.
Legally: 
First and foremost lets understand that bitcoin and laws are two different universes. Laws are created by humans to control other humans/society. Laws are not always moral, not always just, and most of the time anti-scientific. Bitcoin resides in a scientific/mathematical law space that and is represented as encoded in Bitcoin code, that is designed to be not subject to anti-scientific laws. As such the answer, "legally", is not the dimension that has any practical jurisdiction against Bitcoin.
Practically it is stored as informal consensus of Bitcoin nodes  and miners who store information in their distributed ledgers, as long as you have private key you can claim associated value.

One day, eventually, European Union will disintegrate.
This is not the first time they were trying to cobble European Union together though. There were many attempts in the past in various shapes and forms.

The old school economist understand damn well what the bitcoin is. they do.
However their entire structure, social "contracts", are built on the premise that people are to dumb to understand how to handle their money.
Their social structure are a true Ponzi Scheme. Social Security, for example.
Bitcoin is the new gold.
Central Banks are too arrogant, too self important and too recalcitrant to even consider buying bitcoins. Quite frankly, central banks, in their current form and function, are not needed at all, and they will be extinct and not relevant, just like irrelevant become telegraph offices.

This map is a bit misleading. Russia has large territory, however not too many nods.
It is the number of nods is the good indicator of real political influence.

BCC is the altcoin, albeit heavily promoted/advertised/supported.
Pretty much everyone can have his own altcoin. I need to preditct that BCC will be trading for $300, and will later drop to $150. 
BTC will rise to $3,500. My two cents...
