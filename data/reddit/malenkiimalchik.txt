Not always. Inflation and deflation aren't direct products of total currency or value. Relative scarcity in the lower and middle class can have the same effect.

This is the problem with 'anarchists," libertarians, et al. No offence to the OP, he or she isn't the only one not thinking it through, but come on! The whole reason government exists is to fight the tragedy of the commons.

Why don't we all commit together to a perfect society? Why is there still war and hunger? 
No one knows, man, but pretending that people are going to act in a way that all of history says they won't is counterproductive.

Sure. Roads are a traditional example of a tragedy of the commons. I like roads, you like roads and pretty much everyone else likes roads. However, no one individually stands up and says, "I am going to donate my money to building roads." Maybe a few people do, but not enough. Right now, the White House is trying to pass a bill that would repair damaged highways over the next four years for $302 billion - this isn't an unreasonable cost.
So, to get roads built, someone has to take money from everyone. That's the whole idea behind taxes - if everyone is forced to give a little, no one has to pay a lot.
This is extrapolated generally to say that government should be there to get things done that benefit all of us, but that none of us can do by ourselves. Does it always work like that? No, but that's the idea.
Last note: Someone in this thread mentioned WalMart building a road - yeah, giant companies that are going to benefit from a road in the long run will consider it. Unless America is to develop into an 'all roads lead to WalMart' type society though, we probably need more roads than that.

This, so hard. So many people seem to have this idea that it makes sense to hold BTC, but using it as a speculative investment is why so many talking heads call it a ponzi scheme in the first place. 
If it were gold, or something else with intrinsic value, than maybe it would make sense. Currency, however, is only valuable long term if it is being spent.

Well, pretty much anything. It's fascinating to think about the development of a bitcoin micro-economy. Almost anything could happen. 
On the one hand, it's possible that the average undergrad will prefer to just cash out and have $100 in their pocket. That would be pretty boring, but we can't discount it as a possibility.
The next level up, in terms of adoption, would be if merchants in the surrounding area started taking bitcoin to cash in. Interesting things could happen here, or they might not. It could be that these kids spend their crypto on local goods, some get interested, some just run out and go back to dollars.
Where it gets really interesting (in my opinion) is when we look at the possibility for continuous use. For example, if merchants started competing for crypto business by offering a discount to business done in bitcoin, it might motivate more students to re-up when the $100 runs out. This could lead to some really cool long-term use possibilities.
Apart from that there are all kinds of neat possibilities for micro-entrepreneurship. It's a pretty exciting time to be in Boston.

That would be fascinating. I'm not surprised that they don't though - the operators don't even want to show how big the site actually is. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 00:08:31
Honestly, I'm not sure that it's a good thing for companies that big to get into bitcoin. If Paypal already charges ~3%, how is that different from using normal money? 
Guess it's cool though - wider body of users and all that.
@_date: 2014-08-05 23:08:44
Fair point, I shouldn't have editorialized. There's no moral judgement on rich people saving instead of investing during a depriciatory spiral, they are making a sound financial decision. It's a tragedy of the commons, though, and it can have potentially catastrophic results. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 16:26:44
Well, think about it then.
We're talking about the worst case scenario, so lets think about the worst case scenario. The worst deflation ever seen in the U.S. was - very briefly in the 1700s - about 20 percent. That means that just by holding money for a year, it increases 20 percent in value.
So, say I have a few million dollars. I could invest in a business and see a modest gain of 5 to 10 percent. I could start my own business and maybe see 20 percent or more. For no risk whatsoever though, I can just hold my money and get 20 percent richer.
Why would I invest that money?
@_date: 2014-08-05 17:36:32
Sure, it would be unlikely to be caused by the same things. 
I'm not even saying that deflation is a realistic possibility with bitcoin, at least not in the classic sense. The above poster was suggesting that deflation was no big deal, when it emphatically is. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 20:46:16
The divisibility doesn't really factor in that much. The point is that even for small amounts of money, the promise of future value increases encourages hoarding. 
This community and bitcoin as a whole will be better off when we can let go of the idea of value increases and focus on the benefits that bitcoin - and not its value - can create.

Maybe... I think it's unlikely that the feds would try to prosecute all of the users though. At most, they might take it down like the first one. 
Were any users of SR1 prosecuted?

Wow - this is a little off topic, but I got frustrated and stopped looking at this sub for a few months. It's great to see some sanity back here again. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 16:45:36
Well, I'd say it's relevant. I'd be curious to see the total USD transaction volume for the period Feb 2011 to July 2013. Looking quickly at [daily transactions]( for that period, it looks like most days saw under $1 million, though it picks up hard at the end.
The feds say SR saw $1.6 billion in that time period, right? So even if the average was $3 million per day, that's total transactions of, like, $2.6 billion.
Not that I couldn't be missing something, I *definitely* could. But that suggests that SR was a huge part of the BTC economy at that point.
@_date: 2014-04-22 15:09:13
I think it's kind of funny. I wouldn't really say that bitcoin is monetizing the 'revolution' do much as Hollywood is. Look at all of the revolution oriented movies coming out. Not that you can blame them, it's just supply and demand, but it's a little funny that we consume revolution themed media from an outlet that practically embodies 'the man'.

Why did my post get down voted? 
Honestly, that's US bankruptcy, and it's extremely unclear how a bitcoin related bankruptcy here would even work, much less one in Japan. I can't imagine that Fiat and bitcoin would be treated much differently. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 16:19:18
This is not quite right, actually. You've compared a mild case of deflation with a dramatic case of inflation.
The real worst case scenario under deflation is that the rich save their money. In a seriously deflationary economy, it no longer even really makes sense to run a business. So few people have money to buy things from you that it is literally more profitable to hold the money in your bank account. Producers stop producing because the average person has no money to buy things with and everything grinds to a halt.
You can see something similar in poor, rural areas of South America and Greece. Interesting note though:Most of the time when I've read about it, they are talking about local people creating new, local currencies.
In the short term, a value increase for Bitcoin is necessary to bring it to a viability point. In the long term, some inflation is likely to become essential.
@_date: 2014-04-26 16:47:07
I write about US bankruptcy sometimes, and this is close, with one important difference - secured vs unsecured creditors. Whether Japan has the same thing, I don't know. 
In a bankruptcy proceeding, different creditors have different rights. If you are an investor, for example, you are typically a secured creditor, meaning you are more or less first in line to be paid. After that, unsecured creditors like those who are simply owed money, get to fight over the rest.

Really, the benefit is the bitcoin demographic - male, young, tech-savvy and wealthier than the average consumer. Plus, not that many places take it yet, meaning that you would be one of the few outlets for all of their extra cash.

A quick amendment - not like stocks. Stocks are one of the few things that can't be given as an in-kind donation.
A better way to say it would be 'like gift cards.'

I take your point, but what about the average user?
If your PayPal account, or PayPal generally, is hacked, I would assume that you still lose your identity. I don't think you can make a PayPal account without using a legit identity, the same way you can't open a bank account.
No additional funds at risk is a plus.
Instant settlement is useful for the company, but PayPal and everyone else already makes settlement occur instantaneously from a user's perspective for most transactions.
I suppose I'm not against PayPal's use of bitcoin, I just feel like it moves us toward a more regulated bitcoin.

Honestly, this is a pretty limited view of things. 
While most people would agree that Soviet-style central planning didn't work out very well, there aren't really modem economists who think that the economy doesn't sometimes reach a more optimal solution through government intervention. 
An example might be pollution. I a totally free market, a large company that produced a good might also produce significant pollution. While the goods are shipped all over the world, the pollution is local, meaning no pressure to stop polluting. The old theories talk about the invisible hand solving this, but even a cursory glance over recent history debunks that idea. 
That is, actually, a reasonably solid argument in favor of the Fed. One of its purposes is to stabilize currency. We had a real, easily visible deflationary problem in that first big push to $1k, in which that Mt Gox bot was buying up BTC to artificially limit supply. In many ways, the Fed exists just to prevent such an event. 
A note about your final point. We also tried socialism in the 1900s. We did a bad job then, but it isn't the 1900s anymore and it might just be time to try again. 
Big picture, bitcoin is going to have some problems on the horizon. If it were a massive, truly global currency, it might reach a critical mass at which it was no longer subject to manipulation, but otherwise it might potentially benefit from some similar help. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 19:42:30
That's extreme in either side. In the short term, yes, the price increases brought a lot of people to the table. I don't think anyone serious thought this was sustainable, as price volatility actually hinders the real utility of bitcoin vs. The dollar, but I suppose some people got rich. 
I don't think that price inflation makes bitcoin 'evil' from the community perspective, just less useful. Money that appreciates in value encourages hoarding. 
It's weird that I'm getting down voted here when the depreciation problem is extremely palpable in this community. There is a massive whale problem here - remember? With a little bit of inflation, instead of holding that money, these wealthy hoarders would have to invest *using* bitcoin instead of *in* bitcoin.

Maybe this is a dumb question, but doesn't bitcoin have to start charging transaction fees once all of it has been mined?
Mining is a downright revolutionary way to encourage people to help with payment processing, but won't that all disappear as soon as the last bitcoin has been mined?
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:33:45
Interchange fees, also commonly called transaction fees, are paid by the merchant. They are what this article is about.
One of the things that attracted me to btc was the potential for micropayments. There are a lot of industries (news for example) that could seriously benefit from a solid micropayment infrastructure. With interchange fees in the picture though, they are virtually impossible. I guess bitcoin doesn't have an answer for this - still cool, but that's a bummer.
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:39:01
This was a great response - thank you! That's really fascinating. So even now there are some optional fees that are used as incentives?
How large are these fees and how high would they have to be to keep miners going without the bitcoin reward (theoretically - I know 2140 is pretty far away)? Could transactions of ~$0.05 make sense or is that too low? $0.01?
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:48:06
Hmm, maybe I don't understand mining as well as I thought I did.
The way I understand it is that the computing power that is needed for payment processing (massive amounts) is handled by mining. People let their computers go to work on these calculations and are compensated by newly created bitcoin. I'm not sure what that has to do with network security though.
Eventually new bitcoin will "run out" and to get folks to continue mining, fees will have to be assessed on every transaction. I'm not sure what you mean about utility here - it clearly already has some utility, but one of those useful functions is that transactions are free. That will disappear eventually, right?
