iirc Steam bans for buying from cheap regions using VPNs and whatnot. I'm not sure how this applies to receiving gifts bought but it probably gets flagged.
Not trying to sales trash but be careful everyone.

Such a gorgeous car

To score the lowest prices? I don't think it is.

Switched to my Nexus 5 about 4 months ago and don't regret it at all. :)

Is this a serious article
lmao this is sad

I hate these misleading surveys. It should be more than 50% of the few thousand Americans we surveyed.

The best antivirus is yourself. If it looks too good to be true, is $500 off the products actual price, etc... It is most of the time an infection. Now I'm not saying all pirated software is infected, but just be cautious.
No antivirus will or will ever be able to detect all malware/infectious software.

It could, or people could be paranoid about losing money so they might wait longer to buy causing them to drop more.

Bitcoins are the future.
Until they crash.
Then rise again, 30 minutes later.
I wish I bought some when they were $50, kicking myself right now.

I can guarantee 99.9% is not infection free.
Maybe a good portion, but there are thousands of people who post infected software online. Even reputable sources or users.
You spend a year gaining reputation from posting legitimate safe downloads, and then you infect them with another post when they think it's safe. You gain lots of money from this. It's the perfect plan and can happen all the time.

Thanks, didn't even realize there was one.

Let's hope he doesn't ruin his life with this money.
$971k is quite a lot for a small hobby that cost him ~$1,000-2000 in 2009.

Only time can answer that

If you are caught falsely reversing your payments, I'm sure authorities can be involved. Can't they?
Even if it's an intangible object or service.
Say you bought a service from someone two years ago online. (Anything, helping you research, playing your MMO account to level you) and you charge back for unauthorized access. Wouldn't that count as fraud? Your basically stealing.

inb4 your developer status is revoked. Apple hates bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-14 19:40:51
I wouldn't be surprised if Apple didn't want users interacting with bitcoins because they were making the Applecoin.
Starting price is $600 ea and there will be the Applecoin Mini in 6 months that is the same price, same coin, just a different name.
Oh and the Applecoin Air 6 months later.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:33:59
That's crazy. $1,500 to $140,000 in a year.
I would take out $10,000 now and enjoy it, and then wait until the rest are worth $500,000 or even more, then cash that out.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:33:31
I would say wait for a drop, they went down a lot a bit ago, after rising all day. They're back up again though.
Don't invest all your money in them, because right now millions of others have the same idea as you.

Bitcoins are really the money of the future.
It's exciting to realize that we are the generation where a new worldwide digital currency began.

I wouldn't be surprised if he had 5,000 BTCs solely from the money that has been wrongfully taken from PayPal accounts.
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:08:26
I have had only trouble with PayPal. We ran a game server and thankfully did not experience many chargebacks over the two years from donations.
However one user charged back 4 donations of over $50. We lost it all because of PayPal's oh so amazing dispute help center.
The thing was, the email he donated for was his username too. So like username or whatever he had it. He claimed unauthorized access, and I doubt someone who hacked your PayPal is going to donate to a random game server for your game account.

Bitcoins are dropping, people are losing money. I wonder when it will hit 700$+ again
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:32:18
I'm not watching them now. I was earlier and they were going up fast, then they just dropped
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:44:51
Ridiculous. Apple loves to ruin all the fun.
Can't wait for my Nexus 5.
