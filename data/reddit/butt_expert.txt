Yes, and like the other reply that outlined the process mentioned .... there are a lot of steps. Especially when you compare investing here to investing in almost anything else. 
That also ignores the issue that if you’re not well versed in this, there are also a lot of different options for a lot of those steps. Which companies, or products, or sites to use for them is a huge question by itself, and especially as someone who has followed bitcoin for a long time but not actively participated, it’s really not that easy to keep track of which entities and companies are legitimate and “safe” to use to handle your money and which aren’t. The gold standard exchanges in 2010 are no longer the ones to use. Which wallet to use has changed. How you track and manage things has changed. Etc, etc. It just feels like I’m gonna fuck it up and get scammed cuz I don’t know better.
It feels kinda like how I imagine old people trying to find internet porn on their own or torrent movies on their own would go. All kinds of ways to royally screw it up and get sideways on it but the people who have been doing it seem to intuitively know which buttons are real and which ones are fake. It’s especially tricky when you know you are literally giving money to someone somewhere in exchange for potentially  nothing.

I mean maybe not for people who know how but to the rest of us that is kind of the biggest issue. I have no fucking idea how. It IS hard to buy for us.
