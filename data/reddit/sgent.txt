As far as I'm aware (and I keep up), neither the US nor any other country has imposed broad sanctions against VZ.  The US has imposed financial sanctions against six individuals who are suspected drug trafficers, etc.  Citgo (owned by PVSDA) still refines oil and sells gas in the US, none of that has been impacted by sanctions.
This clusterfuck was initiated by the  financial mismanagement of Chavez and accelerated by Madero and the miltary.

GNU / Linux (although GNU's Not Unix) with the Android and Linux servers, and MacOS (originally Mach) on the desktop / iOS.  BSD also has its place.

I use bitcoin as a substitute for gold in my portfolio -- and I agree, like gold, its a deflationary and therefore very volatile, with boom/bust cycles that are much worse than other assets in general.  I actually think they are much the same asset.
That being said, a 5% gold allocation would have increased your gains and significantly decreased portfolio volatility if bought in 1974 (after we coming off the gold standard in the US).  Its hard to know what it would have done in the cycle from 65-73 because we were still on the standard.
I think the advantage bitcoin holds over gold are its portability, and ease of use.
I very much hope it never becomes a reserve currency, as that could lead us back to the periods from the 1880's - 1944 / 72, which make today's markets positively tame.

A whole bunch of gas stations in my area use libertyx to sell bitcoin.

Probably because you want to buy toilet paper.

No, you'll be fine.  It may take a little longer because everyone is trying to have the first segwit confirmation, so TX fees have risen (probably) temporarily.  That said, all old wallets are still completely compatible with the bitcoin network, they just can't use the new segwit functionality -- lower fees, multi-sig, etc.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:40:07
We will see.  I hope lightening network has a mechanism for a receiver to set the fee rather than just the sender.  This is needed in the world where merchants pay the transaction fees, and not the purchaser (ie credit cards in the US, Europe, etc.).
With out it a fee of &gt; 0 is more than I use for my Visa card.

I am definitely interested -- and would pay for a good one.

CBOT has already announced cash settled futures, which will hedge risk better than ETF options.

A bank is more likely to shut your account down transferring out TO coinbase than from coinbase.
That said, both coinbase and gemini are fully regulated, and people shouldn't have problems using those two exchanges.
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:05:38
Thanks for the answer, they finally processed it.
@_date: 2017-08-06 06:39:47
Gemini is probably fine.  Less reputable exchanges may lead to problems.

It won't go near that far.  They will send you a letter, and you send them a letter back saying you never sold the bitcoins, they are held in wallet xxx which is in my name, and I sign it under the penalty of perjury.
Audit over.

This is no different than regular banking pre-FDIC / Federal Reserve.  It caused massive swings in the economic cycle, between depression and growth.  We haven't had a depression since going to a federal reserve system and FDIC insurance.

The need is there, if not today then in a year or two.  If transactions are much more than 25 cents, then there is a need now.
The replay protection issue is because the signatories don't consider it a fork.  If you want replay protection, than the developers are free to add it to the 1mb chain.
Lack of consensus seems to be an issue, but not really.  There is economic consensus, but there are some holdouts that have issues with it.

Because no one has deployed it yet, because there is no software written to deploy it.  Its slowly getting adopted, and will get there, but it will unfortunately take a while as the eco-system was woefully behind the curve.
This is the same thing I'm afraid of with LN -- we may see it in 6-9 months, but it won't be usable for 1-2 years.

Calls are a type of option, this is a futures contract.
@_date: 2017-09-22 07:29:11
The futures contracts submitted to the CFTC are cash settled.

Your correct, but the cop could go to a court and get him thrown in jail until he turns over the funds.

The FBAR is an information return -- not a tax.  If you don't file it, I recommend getting a reliance letter from a CPA or Attorney.  The IRS in the last 5-10 years has put two types of people in jail -- those who fail to report income, and those who hide offshore assets.  Failure to file a FBAR would potentially become the second type of offense.

The next DNM, if they are smart, will ban fent (and similar) and weapons (at least firearms, etc.).
The US cares about fent in a big way, and Europe cares about weapon smuggling.
