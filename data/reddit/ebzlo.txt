Reading up on this, sounds interesting (and that bounty is pretty sweet sounding too)

Np. Happy to share!

So when you say no support, what are you referring to? Dispute resolution would certainly get hairy without a third-party stepping in, right?

This was really helpful. Thanks!

I've been using Simple for a few years and about 6 months ago, fully converted over. I don't need a ton of banking features and was completely won over by their mobile/web app (i.e. I never have to use a shitty bank app and answer their shitty security questions again).
If you don't need all the bells and whistles and just want to get your banking shit done, it's perfect.
I don't know how many people can actually sign up through this link, but you can skip the waiting list here:

I know this is mostly in jest (forgive me if it isn't), but is there a large demand to spend bitcoin on goods and services right now?

It seems this is becoming a common theme. Is the decentralization a concern of fees or trust?

Thanks! This is correct; the personalized link appears to be the only means of sharing invites now (they previously, periodically, gave me a limited number of invites to send to people via email).

Simple gives me a referral link to sign up directly here:
Edit: Looks like I'm getting downvotes for posting a personalized link: there are no referral benefits, I'm just trying to share. :)
