That's in movies. In real life, you play on credit and make the payments through somebody on the outside. Alternatively, you explain bitcoin and pay with that directly.

If i value my coin at $1000000, why would i want to use it for anything else than a investment for the future? When currency is stable and my employer pays me in BTC or BTC-backed units, then I'll gladly use it for every day business. Until then, I prefer convieniance before ideology.

You have to re-define the question for it to become relevant to your interests.
The killer app for communication was the internet with e-mail, killer app for GNU was the Apache project, and the killer app for trust is the blockchain with bitcoin.
I believe bitcoin needs to become user friendly with a modern GUI, and find stability within the multi-trillion market cap. Several bank runs in the U.S. and EU may wake up the masses.
Also, Ethereum law.

One of the comments:
"I had a eureka moment reading this article and I think I now understand the meaning and implication of blockchains.
The authors are right: blockchains will revolutionize the way assets are stored and transferred because sound processes that simplify and accelerate by abolishing intermediaries will always win. We shouldn't read too much into Bitcoin's problems: it's the first iteration of a dramatic new paradigm, and even if it fails entirely and disappears the concept will live-on and flourish  
The implications for this are truly enormous and very disruptive."

I've used safello for a while now for $1-2k amounts. Maybe their reserves ran out. Give them a tweet and ask.
@_date: 2015-01-29 19:23:17
You're right, thanks for the enlightment.
Edit: To elaborate: I'm using bitcoin as a store of value for my life savings. But i rarely use it for purchasing goods, because i don't want to miss out on any future capital losses. But the bitcoin is not only a protocol for storing value, it's mainly a transactional vehicle for value. And it should also br used as such, if I'm already using it as a store of value.
Both parts are equally important. I'll be using bitcoin wherever i can skip using the old system.
That's why I was trapped in dichotomy, I guess.

Probably because DN, one of the biggest newspapers in sweden, made a 8-pages long report on bitcoin and KNCminer a week ago.
Swedes are very slow on bitcoin, people still think it's a ponzi and drug currency. It's sad because sweden in general is very technologically evolved and adapts new tech quickly. But we're blinded by the safety of our national currency the swedish krona.

Dogecoin is a clone of Luckycoin, which is a clone of Litecoin, which is a clone of bitcoin. It was created by an Adobe marketer Jackson Palmer in late 2013.
Its main differences is that dogecoin doesn't cap the total amount of coins mined. There are currently 100 billion coins and 10k are added every minute. Bitcoin is the first and biggest cryptocurrency with a cap of a total of 21 million coins.
Dogecoin is known for its mostly young and friendly community and for raising funds for various charities and sponsoring NASCAR-driver Josh Wise to drive the  Dogecar. The currency flourished the most when its market cap was between 50-100 million USD.

I don't see a reason he wouldn't. I think he said it would reach mainstream acceptance in 2019, the same timeframe youtube and Facebook got widely popular. Andreas Antonopoulos gave it a more moderate number of 7-8 years in the 2014 Canadian senate hearing on cryptocurrencies which would indicate going big around 2022.
Personally, I'm waiting for the financial crisis to unfold the coming months. Statistically, a big meltdown happens every 58 months, so it could happen around april 2015 and end in may 2016. This is the period bitcoin will get the spotlights and evolve further.

We've had this system in Sweden for years (with credit card merged) in a couple of different grocery chains. They prevent theft by randomly picking a customer for a security check once in a while.
