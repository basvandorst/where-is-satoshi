Amp set me up with CoinJerk on my stream. I must say it adds a lot of hype to the stream, not to mention it put the very first bitcoins in my wallet. Beyond supporting the streamer content in a safe way and adding entertainment/interaction to the chatters, we found it raises awareness for bitcoins and encourages their use. It has lead to thoughtful discussions about bitcoins, and people are actually going out and learning about our favorite cryptocurrency. Thus the impact of this is far broader than simply accepting bitcoins with real-time notifications (which is an impressive accomplishments on its own), and I look forward to exploring that potential with all communities involved. Cheers!

Very awesome! It was an amazing experience to receive a bitcoin donation via Aperture's new alert system. The bitcoins were received and confirmed. I hope to encourage more streamers and viewers to use bitcoin. I would also like to find more/better ways to get bitcoins to viewers. Thank Amp!!!! Looking forward to further drunken and sober discussions on Bitcoin. Cheers!

I received this bitcoin donation just like a normal one, in fact I could not tell the difference because this system integrated with Streamlabs (previously TwitchAlerts). The alert popped up automatically, just like a normal paypal donation, and we celebrated! It even triggered my custom alert system, along with the normal streamlabs alerts.
