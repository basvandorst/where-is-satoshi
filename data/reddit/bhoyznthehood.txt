I've had a wire reversed by my bank.
Many banks have systems where they liase with the transferring bank to refund it e.g. In the event that a product you order never arrives.

Not correct because fiat is actually useful right now.

Cardano was only traded on one exchange and had existed for about five minutes it smells incredibly suspicious.

Agreed on that. Still makes it difficult to purchase and therefore for uptake to increase globally.

Also if you consider leaving the first restaurant everybody eating there throws vegeta memes at you.

The conspiracy theorist in me thinks Coinbase going down may be due to more than just "technical reasons".

What a great decentralised currency we have here where a small number of exchanges can control prices by shutting down as soon as they sense a dip!

I don't think you have seen this happen before, because this has never happened before.

1) Bitcoin is incredibly volatile and no fit for purpose as a global currency in its current state. It is de-facto controlled by a small number of exchanges who can (dubiously) go offline when the price moves in an undesirable manner. Fluctuations in bitcoin do not reflect geopolitical movements, they represent a bubble.
2) You do not address his point. Bitcoin does not "gain value" over time. In fact, there is no reason why Bitcoin will not "lose value" indefinitely. There is absolutely no guarantee that it will be accepted, its all speculation in a way that fiat is not. People are not going to stop accepting the dollar overnight, to say anything else is farcical. He also raises a valid point about hodlers. Bitcoin is not fit for purpose as a currency when people are not seeking to exchange it for goods and services. It says it all that almost all investors in bitcoin are people are wanting to exchange it back to fiat in the future.
3) You do not address his point. The value of bitcoin is not tied to anything which is of an actual use. He's saying Apple owns various asset classes and in turn creates product. These various assets are tangible and have real-world benefits. Bitcoin only has utility in the sense that people are willing to ascribe value to it, in the same way as gold is largely useless but people store wealth in it. This means that the only thing giving it value is people putting money in, which is vastly different to an investment in a business with actual product.

Literally go read this subreddit and see why people are saying BTC is more suited to holding wealth than every day transactions.

Can someone tl;dr why I shouldn't consider bitcoin cash? Its hard to get much info beyond memes.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:56:27
That's just outright misinformation. The fees on BTC are pretty hefty when buying off certain exchanges. Especially concerned with other coins. There's no point in acting like a dickhead and burying your head in the sand. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:34:54
Isn't the main objection to BTC that the fees are absolutely ridiculous right now?
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:15:03
Fair enough!
