Such hate in this thread. I'm not an avid BC user, so could someone explain to me why people like the blockchain size growing?

Thank you for the informative post. It's depressing that people would downvote this and your other long, descriptive posts, but such is life in the trenches.
Hard to comprehend all this *hate* towards you, and even towards the Bitcoin Core devs that were essentially named and shamed in the blog post that started all this. I know that's how the Reddit bandwagon works, but it still baffles the mind.
Ignore the people shouting MUH CENSORSHIP and debating the technical issues in a thinly veiled attempt to discuss mod decisions -- This is 100% politics and politics is always messy on Reddit. I mean... correct me if I'm wrong, but won't XT effectively kick out three of five Core developers? Isn't that a big deal?

Personally, I see very little difference between these and emotionally charged content. We're mostly in agreement here, but I think you have a higher confidence in Reddit to be polite, respectful and constructive.
Just look at the front page of there's plenty of discussion and a ridiculous amount of bitching about mods. I again don't see the problem, and honestly I doubt you could point towards good discussion that has been removed. 
You can call it censorship, pushing agendas and whatever you like, but if all that's being removed is trollish crap, I have no problem with it.

Eh, if you want to read it that way, I guess. On the front page there's plenty of discussion, so I really don't get what the fuss is about.

If XT wins, that's the fork that stays alive, right? What happens after that? 
@_date: 2015-08-19 19:25:10
You misunderstand me, I'm asking what happens to XT after that? Does it leave the two devs free to progress with Bitcoin as they see fit?
In any case, this is bringing a sledgehammer to a political debate, with remnants of WWJD with all the Satoshi talk.

And that's the thing, the technical change is important but the tactic is repugnant and has a very very bad consequence: Instead of trying to decide what is the best, the field suddenly condensed into 1mb or 8mb, pick your camp, remember to think about ~~Jesus~~Satoshi.
The rule is unenforceable, anyway. There aren't going to be any articles about Bitcoin in the next few months without a heavy emphasis on the fork.
*Edit: Correction, the rule is just to remove 'emotionally charged content'. It should be obvious that screaming and shouting is not good for anyone.*

Good call.
