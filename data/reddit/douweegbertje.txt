I send in a form. I really, really like what this fund is doing but I believe being closer to each other is sometimes the key for positivity and helping each other. Hear me out what I have send: 
Organisations are nice, yet also taking up cash. They are helping a particular group of people or some other "goal" 
Now I'm just here speaking for myself. Even though I'm not rich, I'm doing 'ok'. There are a shitload of people in the world who could benefit from a little amount of cash. Ive been there too. Hell, I'm -700$ negative on my bank account as we speak. 
Nonetheless there are people who need food support, elder people who worked their entire lives having hardly anything to spend. I strongly believe that talking to individual people can do so much more for this world. 
If I was a millionaire I wouldn't donate to charity. I would sit at the grocery store the whole day. Spotting that one person who is having a bloody hard day and/or live and helping him/her out. 
I believe if we help each other out, those people will give back. Resulting in a positive flow for everyone in the end.
The feeling of giving someone a steak, when he had only bread for 2 months is greater than a 'big organisation' spending 500.000$ on 'research' for some technical stuff. I'm a tech guy myself and even I say this. For example OpenBSD, like posted on Reddit, should be funded by tech guys like myself who use it and even make a fairly decent living out of it. 
Help those in actual need. We are often mistaken that those people are living far away. Good chance is that your own neighbour is having an enormous hard time. 
I hope you appreciate my honesty and my message. Maybe we all can take a moment to look around when we are walking from our work to our home. Look at people, talk to them. They might could use help, in any form.
