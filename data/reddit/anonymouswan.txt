What local people on my bitcoin subreddit?
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:16:10
I've had multiple credit unions. My most recent wasn't terrible but did have a pretty outdated app. Notably I am able to log into my chase app with my finger print and my credit cards are directly on that app so I can see what my balances are without having to use multiple apps for each card.

Speaking of, I had disgruntled family members during the holidays talking about how poor of a choice it is for me to purchase various crypto. It's hard to argue with anyone who doesn't have their facts right so I just nod and agree from now on. 
If you come with questions I will answer the best I can but if you come with negativity then I am no longer wasting my time with those people. The train is leaving and they want to sit at the station and complain that it's not fair.

Credit Unions are a mixed bag to be honest. My first credit union (when smart phones first started coming out) took absolutely forever to get an app to do online banking. I was always jealous of my friends at big chain banks who had apps to do whatever they wanted. Then I saw my friends were able to deposit checks by just taking a picture of the check which was amazing to me. No more bank trips! Fun fact, I still have an account with my first credit union with a small amount of money in it and their app has never been updated since it first came out around 2011 and you still can't take pictures of checks to deposit them. 
Also, their loan process is bullshit. They are extremely picky when it comes to auto loans. Basically if the car wasn't brand new then they weren't going to help me. I went in for an $8,000 auto loan that I had a $4,000 down payment for and they denied me. I said fuck it, I'll save the rest of the money and buy it in cash. Fast forward a bit and I'm in the bank getting a certified check written to buy this car outright for $8,000. The teller then lectures me on how it would have been better to take a loan out to help my credit. Fuck you bitch you guys denied me for the loan I wanted and that just cost you money on interest. 
I now go through Chase bank and they are like $60,000 car loan? Fuck it here you go. No, I don't actually have a car loan for $60,000.

They kept calling my cell phone for about 2 months. Eventually I was with a group of friends pretty drunk when they called me. I put it on speaker phone and let everyone have at it. It was about 45 minutes of everyone fucking with the guy pretending to click stuff on their computer before the guy on the phone whispered as if he didn't want his boss to hear "Listen here you little motherfuckers I fucked your mama in the ass last night" and hung up and I haven't heard from them since.

Because 90% of the people here bought in with hopes of bitcoin skyrocketing in price so they can cash out and be rich some day. The focus on price just makes this whole thing seem ridiculous. I thought bitcoin was about abandoning fiat, fighting the man, cutting ties with big government yet all of you would cash out immediately if bitcoin hit an all time high.
This is coming from someone who owns quite a lot in bitcoin and is holding on to them for the future when bitcoin is a more widely acceptable currency. I don't give a shit what the USD to BTC conversion rate is, and nobody else should either. What matters is 1 BTC = 1 BTC. It screams "get rich quick scheme" when a majority of the front page is focused on what BTC is worth in various currencies.
@_date: 2017-01-18 04:37:49
I obviously believe they will increase in value, but the conversion rate is not the value I am looking for. I am not foaming at the mouth every time bitcoin's conversion rate is increasing. Right now bitcoin is hardly usable in the real world. A majority of chain businesses are not accepting them, the majority of people don't own them or don't even know what they are, and the transfer time of sending bitcoin can sometimes be painfully slow. We need to fix all of these things. I want to be able to walk into McDonalds and buy a god damn Big Mac with my bitcoin easily. Until then, it sits in my wallet waiting for the day when I can start using it in the real world.

The problem is banks won't give you a business loan to put into Bitcoin but they will for an ATM to sell Bitcoin. That removes a lot of the risk.

I don't know the nitty gritty technical details, but I do know during crypto's infancy we do need competition to drive innovation. In the end we need to boil things down to just a couple coins. I am not sure on the exact number of cryptocurrencies out there, but eventually it's going to be way too many. If cryptos do become apart of everyday spending, imagine every single place using their own cryptocurrency. Going to the gas station? Hang on I need to stop and convert my coins to Marlboro coins for a pack of a smokes and Petrol coin for some gasoline. We are going to McDonald's for dinner? I need to stop and convert to Ronald McDonald coin first.
Even with crypto in its infancy now, it's still almost out of hand with the number of crypto's out there and most are sadly driven by greed and not innovation or trying to be the better coin. That said, I do own some Ethereum myself since it is a very popular coin and seems to be backed by developers who are innovators and not just trying to make money.

You completely ignored what I said. Here is a perfect example as to why bitcoin may never be taken seriously. Cryptocurrencies weren't created for people to get fiat rich off of them. We will all be able to retire as soon as bitcoin is widely accepted across the world. If bitcoin is widely adopted, 1 bitcoin will be plenty to live off of. Remember there will only be 21,000,000 bitcoin mined total, less if you count bitcoin that was lost and the fact that not nearly that many will be mined before we are dead.
At that point, there will be no fiat conversion to bitcoin because fiat will no longer exist.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:21:37
Says who? Bitcoin will eventually hit a ceiling price where it can no longer go any by people buying and storing it. That price ceiling will be broken when people realize that we need to start actually using our Bitcoin instead of trying to get fiat rich off of it. The day you can buy a big mac with your Bitcoin is the day we all retire.

Is that a correct analogy though?

Not OP, but just ordered mine through Amazon. Depending on how much you have invested, ~$120 sounds like a lot but you could be talking peanuts compared to what some people have tied up.

I think it's stock related. You can own a business and promote it, but I don't think you can be an outside investor who is simply trying to pump value to dump later.

I thought the software was fine, but the listings were pretty lame. It was like going to a flea market and scouring a bunch of junk in hopes of finding something cool. They need to organize the listings based off sales. If one item is selling more it needs to be posted right when you login. Without any form of categorizing things, it's just endless scrolling of garbage.

If the house is truly paid off then he could just rent it out and roll in the profit. Rental properties are huge these days because everyone is uprooting and moving around so much to follow where the work is. My aunt rents out a house that she doesnt have to do anything for except collect a check. She was originally renting it for $500 per month by herself. She eventually signed a contract with a realtor who jacked up the rent to $900 per month but they take care of pretty much everything.

I wouldn't be so sure of that. In the technology industry, its very easy to fall quickly if you don't stay ahead. I don't know much of what is going on but it sounds somebody is dragging their feet which is letting other coins take advantage. Remember myspace? Remember digg? Remember geocities? Remember freewebs or proboards? Google video? Remember ytmnd? I don't either.

I remember being out of town for work and my friend was using western union to send money back home to his family. He had to first find one that was open and go through this entire stupid process to send it. Then his family had to wait for one to open the next morning because they were in a different time zone. 
At the same time a friend asked me to borrow $20. In less than 5 minutes I had bitcoin sent to his wallet on the other side of the country.

There was a redditor who worked as a contracted IT support who said a company hired him to restore the dad that wannacry encrypted. He ended up paying wannacry the ransom they wanted and everything was restored fairly quickly.
