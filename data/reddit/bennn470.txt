Looking at just the top 10 skews the vantage point a little because if you look further into the lists US has a higher representation of most things. 
Also, Choosing to view the biggest companies by revenue is a fairly arbitrary option (plus I said largest) because if you looked at the top 10 biggest companies by market cap (size), they are mainly based in the US. 
As for the Good Country Index, the US will probably never make that list due to its size and diversity.

I don't really feel like finding statistics to refute all of these points because this comment is beyond ignorant. 
Our inflation rate is not 8%, USA GDP is not zero (lol), look up a list of the top 100 universities, service economies are the future as robots will take over manufacturing-based economies -- not service, No one pays 50% in taxes

Well when the interest rates increase the price of the debt would decrease... 
Plus, most of the US debt is held by the US government.

US has the financial capital of the world, tech capital of the world, most of the world's largest companies, best universities, etc.. 
Also everyone talks about the US debt, but really has no clue about economics. The interest rate is far less than the inflation rate, which is very good and as a % of GDP it is still very low compared to other countries.

First, 3 sources refer to the same list and the last one is just a list of British universities. Regardless of which school is  overall, which is a highly debatable question with no provable answer. The US has the most schools in the top 100 regardless of which source you look at.

If interest rates increase the price of bonds decreases. That is finance 101, but doesn't really pertain to this argument anyway. 
If interest rates increase it would not impact previous debt payments they are fixed not floating. 
The Fed is in a very gray area between private / public institution. All I am saying is the majority of the US debt is held by the Fed as well as other municipal governments / social security fund (public). 
Read this article states both sides pretty accurately

I mean it's the metric used in an article listing the top companies by revenue. Plus do you really count a Chinese state-owned utility company that has a monopoly as relevant for the 2nd highest revenue in the world?
All the largest companies (market cap) with the strongest global influence are US, which was my original argument.
