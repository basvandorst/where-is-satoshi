Damn, this market making you grumpy?
Um, I suppose the first thing you could do is show that they liquidated all the Bitcoin. 
The announcement that they received the BTC was like a day ago. If the first thing you do as a Foundation when you receive 91 Bitcoin is dump them to USD within 24 hours without even considering the potential upside of keeping some as an investment or staggering the sales, without board and committee meetings to reach consensus, or taking a moment to breath and wait for a market upswing, then I guess you are pretty irrational.
They *could* have already dumped all **91** (much wow!!), yesterday, but I doubt it. Even if they had, it is not a major factor in this bloodbath.
I think you are just scared, lacking perspective on the ecosystem and possibly suffering from market induced cognitive dissonance.

The failing governments of these nations are not showing interest in cryptocurrency (besides their 'fake' national ones), the citizens are. The governments who fucked up the economies are not the ones trying to adopt bitcoin to fix their economies. And no one is saying it should replace their fiat right now. But the citizens need a way escape hyperinflation and so they turn to bitcoin so any wealth, even daily value they have, doesn't evaporate immediately into nothing. Yet you seem to imply that stupid nation A is interested in stupid crypto B and there is some sort of connection there, as if interest in crypto shows why they would be such fucked up economies. Well, besides ridiculous mechanisms like the Petro, it is the CITIZENS electing to use crypto to escape the failings of their states. Try and argue crypto is not suitable and has no utility to someone trying to to buy bread with money that yesterday could buy a bicycle.

Listen, in November 'hodl' was still in favour as a strat and a meme and for very good reason. The May 2017 bubble had seen the price collapse from $2700 to $2000 in two days, and this was just minor for veterans as there had been many severe Bitcoin bubbles before this point, a notable one being that of 2013 where it crashed from $1200 to $200 and sustained the loss for many months.
So was everyone who didn't sell at the peak of each bubble a noob idiot? No, because most would have fucked themselves over if they had.
The source of the hodl meme is endearing and instructive in its simple wisdom, the underlying concept being that you don't know what's going to happen in markets, especially a fuckshow like crypto, especially as a wide-eyed amateur trader in a gold rush, and that your safest play, if you really 1) can afford to lose your investment and 2) are really in it for the medium/long term (not 9 fucking months), is categorically to not fuck with your investment by 'trading' or trying to time the market.
You were not a noob idiot to not sell in Dec. A lot of people didn't. But the anti hodl sentiment has been building as the year has unfolded. In March a few people thought, wait, maybe I should have sold? Maybe this hodl thing just lost me opportunity. And then April, may, June until now, September, and it became apparent that anyone who sold in December would be able to basically 10x their investment if they sold back then. Hence now everyone is bashing hodl because in hindsight, it was the wrong option. But in March, most people thought we would reach the ATH again any day. And in April and less so in May. And we might have.
But there's a reason the veterans were saying it at the start of Dec run. It's because me and you and the rest of us can't separate ourselves from our present state and the certainty of recent history, so we can't say, what if it had been different? Maybe hodling would have and still might be the right choice. Certainly it is for all the fuckers who think they can just trade crypto as if it's nothing, until they're burned. And to all the big shots saying hodl is only for noobs and you should rather just time the market, please get over yourselves. Maybe you're a pro, fair enough, maybe you've just been lucky so far. Maybe we can't get over our 'what if' regrets from December like the weak willed animals we are, regretful of the facts of the universe and not our judgement at the time based on what we knew then.
But in any case can we please just try and keep some perspective before shouting accusations about the advice that others gave and we took in the past, based in the past. No one knew we'd be where we are now and no one knows where we are going. We will come to remember, venerate and pass on the humble, safe wisdom of hodl once more, because it is still, at the end of the day better for most on average, though right now we're come to resent it based and the way things have unfolded.

It is tangible. It is as tangible as a film on your hard drive or a balance in your bank account. It is more so as it exists in tens of thousands of places simultaneously and cannot be modified. If you honestly think crypto is intangible and this detracts from its authenticity as an asset, you don't understand how many things we value exist digitally and need to educate yourself.
It is usable in many, many ways, not least of all transferring value between parties quickly and anywhere, without a third party. Another very basic example: it enables the ICO, allowing anyone to fund a project without a third party.

If  any company wants to retain customers they need to not steal from them. Why don't companies steal from you? Do you think it is because they can't or because it would undermine customer confidence and hence their business? Do you think companies don't steal from you because it is illegal and they would have the credit card transactions reversed? No, if you steal, you go out of business. The bitcoin transactions can't be reversed but they can't be denied either, and the company can transfer them again. The evidence of this person's claim remains forever on the blockchain.

I believe valid addresses 'exist' regardless of whether you explore them or not. If it's a valid address, it exists, just not on the blockchain. Addresses are 'created', in that they feature in the blockchain, when bitcoin is sent there only. Before that they are potential addresses.
Unless you mean 'wallets' like wallet accounts or something? But creating a wallet is just deriving a whole lot of addresses (see above) from a specific seed, so again, unless you send some funds to any of those addresses, creating a wallet doesn't really affect anyone.
As far as I understand it.

Each exchange is its own microcosm.
If I say to you, you can buy this thing for $1 and you agree, the new price of that thing is $1, between us.
If there are two other people and one says the other can buy this thing for $5 and the other agrees, the price between them is $5.
That is the basic structure of an exchange. It is people exchanging things based on agreed upon terms, hence the name. Each has its own price based on who uses it, how it is accessed, which nations have access, platform fees, etc., but the fundamental point remains that the price per exchange is set by the last act of exchange that took place, by the people who were willing to exchange that good with one another at that price within that microcosm.

This is called 'timing the market' and something you can't do reliably. You can try it and you might succeed, or you might lose everything. If you're invested responsibly, it won't be everything, and you can get on with your life, which is what people recommend. If it is everything and it goes sour, you could have ruined your life and prospects.
People had the same thought as you in Dec 2017, buying at $19000+, absolutely convinced, like you, it would keep going up. In hindsight you say the crash was obvious, but if we crash now after this parabolic rise in the last few weeks, you would say the same thing, 'it was so obvious'. If those that bought near ATH held until now, they might have a chance to break even. But a lot of people sold for a loss when the despair kicked in. Why? Because they put in everything and couldn't sustain their lives with it going lower.
You're experiencing irrational exuberance. Emotions steering your thinking are hard to recognise and tame, but they are extremely powerful. Be responsible.

You had a plan and you stuck to it. You can't berate yourself because of the outcome.
If it had nose-dived at 10K back to 7K, you would be happy. If it sky-rockets to 15K you will be sad. BUT you shouldn't in either case be 'upset with yourself' or disappointed with yourself.
Can you see it makes no sense to judge your actions on the outcome? They should be judged or your due-diligence before making the decision, your reasoning. If those are sound and you committed to your decision, then you can only feel sad, but not 'disappointed in yourself', because that is emotional and irrational and will get you fucked up in crypto.

There is a chance the price will continue to rise up to and beyond the fork, but there is a lot of speculation that the price is about to crash just before/after the fork. 
Because volatility is at an all time high at this time, it is a gamble to get in now, and a gamble to wait for a crash, because you're trying to time the market. An advantage of getting in now is that, if you get your BTC and have it on a fork-friendly exchange/wallet, you'll get the new coin from the fork when it happens. However, no one knows and no one can say what will happen, so you need to research and be at peace with any decision you make and be able to stomach the potential consequences.
If you believe Bitcoin will continue to climb in the long-term, then it really doesn't matter, as the short-term profit/loss you'll undergo if you buy now will be nullified over time, so you don't have to fret about making a high-risk, low reward gamble. I suggest you look up 'dollar-cost averaging' as it is the safest way to get crypto.

No one owes the coin anything and you can do plenty for the community without spending your bitcoin (not saying you shouldn't spend it if you want to). But it's really ironic, because your assumption, that people forcing themselves to actively do something unnatural or counter intuitive with the coin is a good way to help with its maturation, is in fact the counter productive path. It's the same as websites forcing users to disable adblockers to use sites. They are trying to force an old model onto users who have outgrown that model. The least effective ads are ones that you force users to endure when they have indicated they don't want to.
Bitcoin must be useful of its own accord, for how people want to use it only, in a manner that fits in with their behaviour and needs. We mustn't force ourselves to use it in ways which are inefficient for us in a vain effort to force adoption. Why do you want to urgently force artificial usage anyway? Is it because you want the price to go up in the short-term? If not, then let it unfold naturally. Have a think about what you are actually pushing for -- it could be the case that you actually just want the price to go up as the ideal end.

Say you sold BTC at $70 after buying at $.30. Then you buy back later at the ATH of $1000. It's getting back in, and comparable to this, as long as he doesnt sell this time. Things change, people change, the market changes. You can't say everytime someone sells at an ATH (which turns out to be very low later) then buys at another ATH it is necessary GREED or more greedy than just holding. That is a stupid broad assumption.

You're such a deluded, feeble little baby, still crying that your precious apartheid was taken away from you, just like it took something away from someone else. Why are you so angry? Why are you so racist? What happened to you? Do you even ask yourself why you are so hateful of other humans? Sies you fucking disgrace. Make me vomit.

How can people tell you if it's gone or not without information.
Let me ask you this question and see if you can answer. 
Guys I used my credit card to buy something online. Is it real or a scam?
Does that help you understand how meaningless your question is?

There will always be dips and there will be crashes. There will always be opportunities, certainly as good as there are now. That's how you get over it.

Possibly. Could also be them dumping for strippers.

Asshole spotted ^
It's surely greedier to hold, no? Because you want more money? Not to sell low.
Just because he fucked up by trading badly doesn't mean he's more greedy than anyone else. Fear got him, not greed.

So according to your overlayed timeframe, we can assume the greed/delusion parabolic rise and peak was December. It's now beginning Feb and we're at capitulation, meaning the return to mean will begin when?
April? If you want to apply the graph to crypto and its timeframe, then the rebound will be soon, not years away. So, problem?
Not saying we should invest in this graph, but if you want to, then follow through.
Antonoplous said crypto grows by bubbles.

That is quite a claim.
To say never ever though demonstrates your own extremism. Of course you might be right that she will not be wealthy but to rule it out, as if you can see the future is as crazy as anything else on here. Or are you a prophet?
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:01:05
No doubt?
Look with your prophecy skills, just wait until you have some goddamn money and then you can always time the market. The market's not going anywhere

How about the people who sold 15k+ ... on the way  up?
then decide to buy back in what  BTC starts storming up again at 18k+?

@_date: 2018-12-08 22:21:54
Assuming it happened the way it *did*.
People, like you, just can't see their own hindsight bias. You look at what happened and say, 'that happened, so it was inevitable, so I should have acted according to what happened'.
People sell the bottom and people sell the top, and people sell all the way up and down, because it's unpredictable. 
It's not profitable in the short term to hold from the top to the bottom of an extended bear trend, but it's less profitable to sell at the bottom and buy back at loss.
This year has felt long but it's only been a year.

You need to convince the miners who currently secure bitcoin, and the users, to use your version.


Ver and friends tried this. It is called Bitcoin Cash (more or less). Ultimately a large part of it was a question of brand identity. You need to convince everyone that your fork is the real, better bitcoin. They tried very, very hard to do exactly this. But they could not succeed.
So, nothing stops you trying, but you will fail.


Hypothetically you could. Practically, even with immense resources, you'd have an immense challenge in convincing people why your bitcoin is better, even if it is, and that they should switch.


What is so special and irreplaceable is that it is bitcoin. It is the first, most supported, and ultimate crypto currency. It is about much more than utility.

To hodl is to accept that you can not time the market (in the present, not like you and every other genius who can time it in the past), and that you are not expert enough to try and trade cautiously or competently, so you just hold and, if your belief in the tech is warranted, you come out on top in the end.
It's not that hard and is statistically the best long term strategy for the average casual retail investor, assuming the long term trend is up. Make sense now?
