If you actually did that, you are incredibly misguided.  Bitcoin is essentially a commodity now rather than currency.  Good luck paying your rent/mortgage...

Tip from someone who got in at $10: I watched bitcoin go from $1200 in christmas of 2013 or so to basically $200 in a matter of days.  I would not be surprised one bit if it did it again.  I would suggestion that everyone should sell now or within a 1k-2k increase to avoid being caught when the bubble pops.

Haha, well it might have been thanksgiving too, either way my point still stands.  I did indeed have "skin in the game", around 20 or 30 bitcoin at the time, I don't remember the exact number because they were all made from satoshi dice and mining.  I was simply going off of memories from 4 years ago, so yes, maybe I was a bit off but it doesn't really matter once again.  This is a bubble, and even people on this forum who once shilled for bitcoin are beginning to see that.  I didn't think it was a bubble when it went to 1200 either, and then it proceeded to drop to basically $200 overtime, which I actually thought was pretty healthy for the currency at the time because it appeared to be stabilizing in value, and just slowly increasing over time.  This huge growth once again proves that the volitility of bitcoin limits its use as a currency.

Lol "outrageous" prediction.  Not much more outrageous than me watching this coin go from $10 in late 2012 to basically 20k in 2017.  Dropping to 1k is completely reasonable, given past volitility.

I honestly feel like the people who write these types of posts are kids who have never had a significant amount of Bitcoin.  DO NOT invest a significant amount of your life savings into bitcoin.  It is simply irresponsible.  Bitcoin will never crash the housing market.

What people in media like to do to bitcoin is to say that "It is a threat to our national security and is DRUG MONEY!!!!!1!!"  They dont research anything.

very neat idea.  Maybe ill do a thread like this in the future!

This is kinda old news, but thanks for educating people that do not know how this works!

A number of years back (2012) when I first got into bitcoin, the whole dream/goal was to be able to do everyday tasks with bitcoin. Going out to eat, buying gas, etc.  Now people laugh at that very prospect when people are interested in doing those things.  The whole decentralized "currency" has devolved into a pure store of value.  You might as well just call this a stock at this point...

You can do this.  The source code is provided for the website so all you have to do is insert your picture into the html and change the values on where the qr codes, addresses, and text go.

Thats pretty cool how that worked out!  In the end, a few more people learned about bitcoins, which is always good!  It would be cool if this happened a bit more so we can get bitcoins to new audiences.

satoshi dice is completely down.  The site, all outgoing transactions, everything.  I had a bet in and nothing is coming back.  Is there a reason to be worried?
@_date: 2013-06-03 04:51:20
+1 this.  I have bought silver coins here and had no issue.  Great escrow!

I personally use [HTTPS everywhere](  That makes it so SSL is always on blockchain and the rest of the internet that has it.  If you have chrome or firefox you can use it.

I really wish I had bought coins when they were 12 dollars a few months ago.

currently, its at 17.5.  There's no need to worry, bitcoins are fairly reliable.
