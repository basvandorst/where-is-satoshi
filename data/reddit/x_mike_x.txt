Thanks for showing me this site! I wish I had it as a resource last year when I was actually learning Java in school!

Thanks for the information!

Thanks, I know it's not the best use of time, but this fills up even when you're not on it, so at least I'm not spending a lot of time there - I have bought Bitcoin in the past, but right now I just don't have any money to buy any more of a supply! November-December is that dry period between student loan installments.

uh, no? I'm saying that's what they will do, and it's wrong to do so.
@_date: 2014-11-23 00:25:48
Thanks! I will give it a try then.

which faucet is this?
@_date: 2014-06-26 16:27:48
Well, I'll give you that, but what do you think the are the first things to get cut when there's less tax revenue coming in? Wars and bombs? yeah, right.

Is it really necessary to be an asshole?

Taxes fund road construction, school systems, health care systems, student loans, parks and green space, libraries ... etc. 
How the hell is it moral to evade taxes?

I was told about this faucet called moon bitcoin, apparently they give a 50% bonus if you use the xapo wallet. It's not much and I probably wouldn't recommend it, but I'm a broke student trying to grab every satoshi I can!

I tried to use a localcoin atm last year. I went to the convenience store and realized it's the location at the heart of my city's opiate crisis. This location constantly has incidents involving the police.   
Still, wanting to buy some bitcoin, and the machine was broken. The guy had no idea what it was, or how it worked.   
I sent you guys an email about this, and never heard back. I'd highly recommend moving the bitcoin ATM to another store, literally anywhere else in the city, due to safety concerns. I ended up making Coinbase purchase instead.
