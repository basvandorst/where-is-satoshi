However, I will further ask ... is it a stable enough CURRENCY to invest in? Because while it's worth quite a bit due to being limited, exclusive, and secure ... it also fluctuates a lot. Am I right or no?
@_date: 2015-05-03 17:50:59
Makes sense.
@_date: 2015-05-09 19:59:02
Woah now, don't get so carried away.
@_date: 2015-05-03 19:44:13
I appreciate the support. That was really kind of you!! I'll read it tomorrow when my eyes are fresh.
@_date: 2015-05-03 17:56:34
Thank you. Videos will probably help more than anything. I really do appreciate the suggestions and references a lot. Thanks again!
@_date: 2015-05-03 19:00:57
Oh. Well that just seems counterproductive ... no? Wasting time in a place you don't enjoy?
@_date: 2015-05-03 19:17:09
Thank you. I will check out all the goodies as mentioned prior when I wake. It's after 2am and my eyes are boiling. I really should sleep.
@_date: 2015-05-03 20:20:02
Coinbase? Say I was using it as you mentioned, once a week or once a month ... not receiving but purchasing. Hopefully someone hires me and I can make some money using BTC more than once a week, heh.
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:07:01
Another redditor gifted me a few bits to do just that with. Hopefully I can learn the ins and outs. I know it won't be overnight - I just want to learn with some guidance so I don't take any shortcuts and skip learning important stuff. To be honest, some of what you've mentioned is actually very interesting, though I may have never thought to research into it and I feel BTC quite relies on understanding it as a whole ... no? It's not my first time making this attempt. I set up a CoinBase account once but then I gave up after advertising jobs because 1. I got none and 2. I had no idea what to do with my CoinBase wallet. So! I am trying to become informed. Hopefully being able to play with some bits will allow me to understand how the transactions work at least.
@_date: 2015-05-04 05:06:45
Glad others can relate. 
  
However, to be fair the post has very much turned around since then. Many people are jumping to explain things and even being so kind as to PM me info or allowing me to ask them questions personally. THIS is the reddit I thought I could count on, and it's brought itself into light.
@_date: 2015-05-04 14:33:16
Well I more-so meant that if bitcoins are at a fixed amount, that makes them more valuable. But if more people have easy access to them [instead of the more exclusive community it seems to be now] wouldn't the value go down a bit, similar to printing a bit of extra money? I may have the idea totally wrong - but that's ok.
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:18:45
Boom, now you explained it in a way I understood. Thank you.
@_date: 2015-05-04 16:30:08
Just wanted to let you know here, since this thread is still active, that I have started your audiobook and learned quite a bit in even just the beginning of it. Many questions have been answered and I'll continue listening tonight. I really do appreciate you making such a source available for people such as myself and I recommend anyone who's new to Bitcoin and BTC as I am to check out your audiobook.
  
This of course goes along with all of the other awesome helpful advice and information I have been given. I really appreciate the support and hope I can give back in the future!
@_date: 2015-05-03 17:32:02
I agree, I should be searching more. But I should say, I have a very difficult time learning on my own and paying attention. I usually ask my friends to explain things to me / show me and I like to show people things I know how to do ... it's just how I learn. That's why I asked for a "cheat sheet". However the r/bitcoinbeginners tip from earlier was a good one!
@_date: 2015-05-04 07:13:51
Good explanation. However it seems a lot like inflation/deflation no? Kind of like ... if someone prints a lot of money it will be worth less or  if many people adapt this currency it may go down in value [even though It's limited] due to it being more easily accessible and tradable at a future point? So is the main focus on security and maybe lower cost of online transactions? Or ...
@_date: 2015-05-03 17:30:27
Well I'm trying to understand more than learn. I can't seem to wrap my head around how it works, how it's used, the fluctuations, etc. It's so ... interesting yet scary [in the sense that it's new]. I want to understand and use it, but I don't know how to crawl yet. I hope that better explains what I'm trying to say. Oh, and to answer your first question as I seem to have evaded it - I want to learn a bit about why it works the way it works and HOW to use it. Mainly, with the advantages I read about, I'd like to incorporate BTC more into my life ... but I have to understand it to even begin.
Edit : Happy cakeday!
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:25:35
Thank you as well. As soon as I finish the article from u/BobAlison I will read this. I appreciate all the info!
@_date: 2015-05-04 05:12:16
This makes sense.
@_date: 2015-05-04 05:08:40
"Some of the sales are from early adopters who've hit some wealth number and they would like to trade risk with newcomers. They're de-risking their position to have the certainty of some wealth today, and newcomers are taking a bet that holding bitcoin could pay off."
Could you emphasize on this?
@_date: 2015-05-03 17:33:49
Fair response, I can respect that. I think I'll need to take some time practicing and maybe ask some people with experience ... I just have the hardest time learning on my own. Hah. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 05:25:49
1. If you have read through this thread you'd see I've tried to learn about bitcoin on my own. I've started a wallet, I've read about it ... I just learn more easily when things are right in front of me, I'm a hands on learner. Call me insulting, but maybe you can take that into consideration when there are 7 methods of learning that I am maybe not the same as you and I am trying to learn about something while having a learning disorder thanks to my epilepsy. But pity me not, as I haven't brought it up for that exact reason.
  
2. Have I tried Google? Really? Did you want to ask if I have tried the reddit search bar too? Because the answer will be the same. It will be an obvious yes. I just don't understand ... and judging by people here, this isn't the most easy thing to understand.
  
3. I'm disrespectful to mention that someone is going through and specifically downvoting only my comments of curiosity? Interesting. I never once said to ANYONE "hell, your answer is shit" or something else ... I upvoted EVERYONE for their participation because in the end, I was learning even if I didn't understand everything they had to say. So once again, I'm ignorant and disrespectful for being curious ... and instead of focusing on one specific topic on something I know NOTHING about I was hoping the people of a subreddit that interests me greatly could make me a bit more enthusiastic so I learn overall instead of cutting off where I already know things. Makes sense.
  
4. Lastly, you mentioned bitcoin isn't for me "at this stage". That's a really interesting thing to say for someone in a sub which is dedicated to a currency that's all about freedom and enabling the holder. Hell, I taught myself how to code HTML/CSS [not that I remember any of it] when I was younger ... was it not for me as well, because I knew nothing about it and had questions eventually? Thanks for participating in this discussion and most of all thank you for being exactly what others have described.
  
Good day.
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:24:51
Thank you! Just pulled this up. Will be reading this as we speak.
@_date: 2015-05-04 16:25:52
That is easily understood, not sure why it didnt make more sense. Thank you.
@_date: 2015-05-03 17:52:53
Makes sense, now follow up ... or you can tell me to piss off and learn for myself - your choice, but here goes ... What is mining BTC and what does it to? When mining [as another user referenced, gold] you may find hidden things. Is this the case with Bitcoin as well?!
@_date: 2015-05-03 20:17:33
I will listen to this now as I fall asleep. I hope you don't take that as an insult, but I like to take things in that way. I will of course listen when I wake as well, but this will be a head start. Man, I really can't thank you all enough - how much this post has turned around and become so awesomely supportive! Thank you!
@_date: 2015-05-03 19:59:20
Quick question ... why does it matter that no one else knows? Can they access my BTC more easily otherwise?
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:08:58
You just explained something flawlessly, and I just sat here with my eyes glazed over. I apologize. It's really no problem - I don't want to waste your time. I think I may need to learn the baby steps first.
@_date: 2015-05-03 17:34:52
Quick followup question ... why can there never be more than 21m Bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:00:49
See ... and THIS is where you lose me. Not that you aren't explaining it well because I'm sure I'll get it but you know, I guess I'm just a visual learner ... but that's ok. I think some people here are unhappy that I'm asking for help/explanations/advice here so I'm going to watch some videos recommended for me by another user and not stir anything more up. Thank you again for helping out, I really appreciate it and hopefully soon enough I can understand a bit more as Bitcoin seems to be something very interesting [as far as banking/currency goes].
@_date: 2015-05-03 17:34:07
Thanks for the tip! I'll check that out!
@_date: 2015-05-03 17:00:06
Really cool!
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:23:27
Thank you. I strictly assumed not as people were downvoting this post and my every comment which I found odd as I didn't feel it was a negative post and was in the right place. But I don't mean to pity myself so I'll move on! I will definitely check those videos out. Those and the ones other users have mentioned [so I'll be setting some time aside, heh]. 
  
So don't worry about mining? Got it. Just as u/Fizzgig69 explained mining well you did too with your comparison to the printing money. That makes sense. To be honest, I'm not sure that's where I see myself yet - delving that far into Bitcoin.
  
I'm not quite sure what to ask, I just want to know the basics. How, what, why, etc. But I understand I am asking questions I can find the answers to ... I apologize for not being specific. So if you think there is something specific you'd like to mention, by all means my attention is yours.
@_date: 2015-05-03 19:03:45
So ... do I want to be waiting because the fees will be low and the priority will be low, or ... Sorry, I'm quite confused again. But this is informative. I appreciate the extras.
@_date: 2015-05-09 19:56:06
I can see why you'd say that, but I would have to disagree ... only because there are large differences. For instance the btc "B" has two lines through it, both of which do not extend through the "B" while the Baht "B" has one line which extends all the way through the "B" similar to a Dollar sign "$". But that's just me being nit-picky. 
@_date: 2015-05-03 17:55:03
Errrr ... so I ask for advice/information and I'm being downvoted? Interesting.
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:32:03
Care to emphasize on your warning? Do you mean just as any possible sub there could be some people whom are not supportive or ... 
@_date: 2015-05-03 20:07:04
Good to know. And how frequent is frequent in the world of bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-05-04 04:59:08
I'll have to check that one out. Thanks for the suggestions!
@_date: 2015-05-03 17:28:48
That's awesome of you! Thanks so much!
@_date: 2015-05-04 05:11:17
So if I post it here, asking for payment for a service ... I'm basically trusting that you're paying me instead of accessing my account?
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:47:26
That's awesome. Really. Congratulations. I would hold onto those at the moment - the value has recently seen it's 1000+ day peak and seems to be climbing. Sadly, I recently cashed out my 0.5btc for airplane tickets which I earned by designing for people on r/Jobs4Bitcoins, but I wish I hadn't because I really love the concept of Bitcoin and I have a lot of learning to do. Again, congratulations - hopefully there's no peak just yet (for your sake)!
@_date: 2015-08-09 20:20:32
Now when you say "People keep saying Bitcoin is a cheaper way for the society to transact. This is absolutely false." do you mean in comparison with wire transfers, paypal, regular banking? If so - I would say bitcoin is for sure cheaper as a flat rate/common rate is usually taken out, no? VS a bank transfer/wire which will cost a percentage. For instance, even a PayPal transfer with a currency conversion is between or up to seven/ten percent of the total value. I'd definitely rather lose a few bits [which could be ten or so dollars] than eighty which my wife just lost with a student loan transaction [as we live abroad from the US].
  
If I misunderstood this, please do correct me - I am still learning.
@_date: 2015-08-05 11:37:36
That was kind of my point ... but I should know better than to be sarcastic on the net.
@_date: 2015-08-05 03:00:12
Is it not an investment?
@_date: 2015-08-05 03:09:50
Guess I don't cruise either one enough to notice. Oh well! Still seems a bit silly to me. Maybe I missed something?
@_date: 2015-08-05 11:38:41
So is a house, car, physical money, stocks, precious metals or jewels, or any other investment. Right?
