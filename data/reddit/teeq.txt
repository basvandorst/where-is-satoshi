A great talk with him:

Nope. There are many weird words but one particularly strange one is graf.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:26:33
Wow. I'm very happy you exist. This is great!

My working theory at this point is this is the algorithm used to recover your guid and password @  I have a pending request with support - sounds like they can get around the email requirement. Will let that play out and then dig deeper. Thanks so much for your help! I'll let you know how it goes.

I've latched onto the typo in the copy "If you forget the details the phrase below". This thread at least confirms the wallet is likely blockchain.info.

I uploaded the file with redactions. She actually isn't totally sure that it is blockchain.info.  but it does look quite likely to be the entire seed. I confirmed it is 21 words. And some really strange ones.
I picked one of the weirdest words (graf) and it isn't in the electrum old, electrum new, or BIP39 word lists.

feature request: would love to see aggregate values for each category for each user.
(eg. 
total buy 3,500,000 Y 
total sell 9,000,000 Y).

Let's not quote or rally behind this individual

I was at a bitcoin meetup group yesterday in Vancouver, Canada. The event cost $15 CAD to enter or $10 CAD if you paid in bitcoins. 
The event was located 100 meters from a bitcoin ATM where you can exchange cash for Bitcoins at market rate + 7% (just over $1000 CAD/BTC at the time).
During the event, the moderator mentioned that almost *nobody had paid for the event in bitcoins*. I was shocked that a group of bitcoin enthusiasts wouldn't take a 33% discount to simply spend the currency they were evangelizing! 
I started walking from person to person asking them why they didn't pay for the event in bitcoins. Many defended their decision as the right move - even the *owner of a bitcoin exchange* said they are just holding. So, I offered all people the same exchange that they had taken at the door - I would sell them $10 CAD of bitcoins for $15 cash on the spot. 
To my surprise, several agreed to the exchange and I sold bitcoins at over $1600 CAD/bitcoin. They knew they could just walk two blocks to buy as much as they want at market rate. I was glad that most just mocked me outright for proposing this rate - but many of them had just taken the same deal moments earlier to enter the event! They simply didn't think of it as money.
;TL;DR; Anecdote where a group of bitcoin enthusiasts refuse to sell bitcoins for $1600/bitcoin illustrates hoarding mentality in bitcoin investors.

where is this number from?

This would be a great pamphlet to convince my boss to off bitcoins in the shop. I am looking for something to give to customers ...

so "i'll bet you six microbitcoins"? Pretty geeky...
[Here]( they are using some slang on the same units which makes it slightly better. 
* 1.02 - One bitcoin and two bitcents
* 0.001 - One millibitcoin (nickname "one Millie")
* 0.000001 - One microbitcoin (nickname "one Mike")
* 0.00000001 - The bitcoin base unit (nickname "one Satoshi")
It's still not very cool imo
