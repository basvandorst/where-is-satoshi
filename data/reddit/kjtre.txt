No one can see the future. Bitcoin could be $100 10 days from now just as easily as it could be $30k 10 days from now.

As someone else mentioned; Venmo, Apple Pay, SquareCash, PayPal, and more are all much easier than sending bitcoin.

People wanted internet because it was a revolutionary utility.
Bitcoin might be a utility but it's not revolutionary, in fact the downsides far outway the upside of decentralizing currency.

Fees, ease of use, hacks, to name a few.

I'm yet to see much evidence people want Bitcoin for any other reason than because it's rising.
Maybe 0.1% of the people owning it "believe" in it as a currency, and the other 99.9% just want to make some money.
USD is not flawed enough to be overtaken, this is a huge bubble.

Lol only crypto I own is Bitcoin, I just don't think this price movement is due to utility but rather speculation, which would mean it's not sustainable.

People that held thru previous crashes would surely disagree.

If you can't afford a plane ticket than this probably isn't the right place for you. As everyone on here will tell you, BTC aren't for investing, there is literally nothing backing it but hopes and dreams, it could fall to 0 tomorrow or climb up the thousands in a few months, or both.

Yeah but I think the high price point will throw a lot of people off, as it did me at first. When I first learned about bitcoin the price was $100 and I was immediately turned off. Imagine someone learning about bitcoin in the future:
Person 1: Bitcoins seems interesting, where can I get one?
Person 2: Well that'd be $3,458
Person 1: nope
It's not impossible, it just seems unlikely BTC will be widely adopted as price goes up, it may become less appealing to newcomers.
