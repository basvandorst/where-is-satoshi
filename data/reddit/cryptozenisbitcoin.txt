Use Bisq, hodlhodl, localcoinswap, paxful or binance that don't require KYC. You could also use cash in person or just buy something with one of the sites that offer products and services. 
There are also many bitcoin credit cards (huge fees) that will swap your bitcoin for letting you use their credit card to buy things. 
Banks are going the way of the dodo bird, fight me


There is incentive for people who want to make money to help people get around these stupid rules. There is also incentive for those who are using bitcoin for illegal things to look for these people that can help them. 
USA wants to control global finance at the cost of everyone else's currency. That will not end well for the holders of US dollars.


BVI, Caymen, Caribbean are the UK offshores along with Jersey and Panama 
Delaware is the US offshore along with the above countries 
Asians use Delaware, Singapore, Nevis, Belize 
Germany is popular with the Europeans along with Malta and the above... 
There is a HUGE amount of money hoarded offshore that isnt in Switzerland. That was decades ago lol

the centralized database (website) doesn't show your bitcoins?
(you should check how the site handles this BEFORE sending btw) you contact the website and ask them. 
Dont send coins to rando addresses or sites that the url could have been changed. 
Send small first then go larger just in case (if possible). 
The ways we send money on the internet are different with bitcoin and crypto.

yeah but you have to go with cash or something because wechat pay and alipay are extremely popular and monitored by government. 
There has been a known underground banking system in China for years. You can move cash between these intermediaries to friends and family but it is very old school and requires a lot of trust in the movers of the money to not steal.

It is one of many "smart contract" solutions that most believe stocks, bonds, equities could be moved onto in the future for a publicly available (either global or nationalized) investment offer. 
There will be global stocks and stock market type things in the future (I believe), nobody can really predict how exactly that is going to play out. 
There are a bunch of "competitors" (not really) to ETH in this smart contract space claiming to be leaner, faster, better etc etc 
It also provides virtual cats for people that want expensive digital cats. And it supposed to do something with Dapps (decentralized p2p apps). And Ether is now supposedly digital money to some people. 
Whatever the "smart contract" solution that later gets adopted to actual assets the banks have digitized (poorly), will be very valuable in the future. The way the analogue banking system moved digital and onto the internet HAS been bullshit, so there are actual use cases that will be used or stolen from by the global banking elites to offer their products in the future.

Why are you holding those 4? What do value about them and which do you expect to see that value increase over the next few years? 
I've had those 4 but can't figure out for the life of me what LiteCoin or XRP are going to do in the coming years or why I even owned those in the first place. 
Ethereum is doing things but I never used ETH for anything and didnt plan to? Holding just to sell higher later, is probably everyone's plan so I sold it.

In 10 years there will probably be a couple things worth looking at BUT it makes no sense to place a value on any of them if/when bitcoins real value hasn't been shown. 
If bitcoin isnt at 1m a coin then forget all the altcoins and different tech in this space because digital money NEEDS to be decided at some point. THEN we can talk alts.

gamblers get their bank accounts flagged or closed when they try to deposit winnings in their accounts in certain countries (US, India, China, Australia it is illegal for most gambling activity) 
when online poker started 15 years ago, the wild west got regulated and that meant gambling sites served and blocked different countries. 
Some places its outright illegal and others like the US are doing state by state legalization for sports betting. The legal/regulated options will have higher costs for the sportsbooks paying taxes, following the banking laws and fraud/security over the crypto options that will just take bets for any bitcoin deposit on sports.

You are wayyy overstating the importance of America to Bitcoin. The first reason being that the richest in America hold their money offshore and don't pay taxes anyways. 
This is the same in UK, Europe, Asia...its just how rich people do this. They have a monopoly on hoarding money and business structures where they dont pay taxes. That being available to common folk IS a problem for all countries but that is part of bitcoins game theory. Nobody can blink because if they do, they get left out of this game and COULD affect their national currencies value. 


No because you still have people able to sell outside of the US to people who wont have the same problems selling bitcoin in other countries. One country could technically take ALL US residents bitcoin sales and ship people envelopers of USD if your REALLY want to get into a thought experiment. 
You also have "underground" markets willing to take bitcoin for "anything" 
Community markets, meetups, people traveling, people moving coins to their friends in other countries... people simply hodling to sell them years and years from now or use as collateral for loans. 
You can't just be a US bank and tell us how we are going to use bitcoin. There may be a small market of "black and white market" coins but coinjoin and wasabi wallet (along with bitcoin mixers), will make that an even worse market to try and scale. 
When the internet started, many tried an intranet and it wasted a bunch of time and money for a reason. Bitcoin wont be the US governments dog, the exchanges that want all this kyc bullshit to continue there will just have less customers over time.

No it isn't. Goods are imported using the Pound and the cost is passed on to the consumer. It costs more Pounds to buy things that British people enjoy importing and consuming...that's a lot of things... 


It's volatile because it is a new technology. If EVERYONE were dumping bitcoin, it would be below Brexit vote levels to buy bitcoin right now. It was only two years ago someone could have bought and actually earned a huge profit owning bitcoin. If it is only at a "stability" buying level now, so what, the Pound isn't stable to hold. 


If I can sell it for $6,000 then it's worth around $6,000.... 
The Pound isn't backed by anything either and has even more uncontrollable factors than Bitcoin does. Bitcoin is there just to store value and allow its owners transfer that value to others wallets... GBP is doing all kinds of weird shit during and after Brexit that the holders of GBP can't control at all.

The point is that $1,000 would be sufficient to STORE VALUE. 
The Pound hasn't fully recovered from it's "fluctuation" since the vote took place. It won't "recover," soon if ever from where it was before the vote. 
Bitcoin is a better store of value than the Pound.

Venezuela, India, Turkey and Russia are "trying" to take different measures to stop people buying bitcoin over the Bolivar (Petro), Rupee, Lira and Ruble. 
Why should anyone think Bitcoin becomes less valuable in countries that take measures like these? Their banks are FUCKING corrupt vs. other countries banks just being KIND OF corrupt. 
If the Pound tumbles, people will buy gold or bitcoin rather than hold onto a currency losing spending power. Since gold was already removed as a standard backing for currencies, betting on bitcoin would be a fairly safe bet.

If anyone is stupid enough to not do any research before making their first bitcoin purchase.... to not even compare the prices of different cryptos and see that "gee bitcoin is the most costly" then nobody is going to sympathize with someone being a moron. 
I vaguely recall checking what bitcoin classic was before owning bitcoin and still wanting bitcoin. Even though the "drama" behind the different types wasn't really clear at the time. 
If anything, Bcash should have brought in people because it is SO cheap compared to Bitcoin but it doesn't seem to do even that. And anyone who gets tricked (haven't heard it's a big problem) is just going to changelly or shapeshift and doing a simple swap.

Everyone using it as money generally believes it will remain "close" to the current amount or more valuable in 5 - 10 years. 
Businesses generally don't want to adopt something that is in this early phase, as bills and employees still require fiat currently. 
Over time it makes more sense, especially in e-commerce because internet money never really existed through banks. 
Stability increases after the next 10 - 15 years as more people adopt bitcoin for different reason world wide. Once we get to around 5% (we arent even at 1%) of the world owning bitcoin, there will be large amounts of educated people chiming in about the "value" of a bitcoin... 
People buying now with a 10 year hodl plan can look back  at how good the last 10 years has been for holders of bitcoin. It wont necessarily do ANYTHING like that in price changes but it only goes down over 10 years if the protocol security is affected.

Lightning is one of the 2nd layers, of two that Im aware of. There will be 3rd layers at some point. And the side chains. 
Bitcoin is the first layer, people store it like gold and other things will deal with transactions. You are welcome to believe that someone will convince everyone that they built a better widget. 
How are they going to build trust and value when people already have millions invested in bitcoin? they're all just going move because the better widget developers say it's better... right.

Holders of bitcoin still have the option to use any of the bitcoin credit cards available world wide. 
Everyone being in acquisition mode and the fee's the cards have, make them rare for a holder to want to use. The options there for all holders though. 
Merchant adoption makes little sense when the staff, bills and taxes are paid in fiat. 
Then there is the regulatory and legislation changes that are needed for any country. Some are in place, some are "planned," some are pretending bitcoin will be banned (India). 
Holders can still use a bitcoin credit card if they really wanna use their bitcoin....

Well we know the global economy is fucked and dont know what people will move to as a hedge against fiat as they drop. 
It is almost certain the major economies shilling USD, EUR, GBP and Yuan will do "something" to try to instill confidence in their economies paper money value. 
It is also clear there are MANY currencies not near as strong that people are questioning. A LOT. 
People need to hedge with gold or a "strong" hedge against all these shitty currencies. Bitcoin isn't the worst gamble, it's all gambling this year though.

nah everyone learns, lurks, then some event happens around a national currency or government change that bitcoin becomes  "even if its a ponzi, fuck this thing that happened on currency X, Y or Z." As is my understanding anyways. 
The more currencies prove to people that we cant control the value of them, the more adoption increases over time.

Its an unregulated market that hedge funds can buy bitcoin and shorts on bitcoin to earn profit on both ends. Of course it is going to be manipulated... the difference is that we know it's possible and will happen again. 


LOL - Banks yearly profits always include illegal activity they know they won't get more than a fine for
Customers didnt know that the LIBOR rate was being manipulated by multiple banks to earn higher fees from customers. 
5 years to get HSBC to settle one money laundering scandal 
Then the dutch launder their money 
Wells Fargo creates fake customer accounts to boost profits 
There is being a tin foil hatter and there is common sense that illegal activity is the product the banks make most of their profits from. 
At least bitcoin is a level playing field to sell at a bubble and buy back when it drops. Banks have an edge where the bank gets as much profit as possible and every customer gets robbed, unless the regulators can catch them. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:40:04
To be fair to the tin foil hatter... JPMorgan was caught manipulating gold markets and the DOJ held back sentencing until late 2019 at the end of last year. 
Many were caught rigging precious medals markets last year. 


If it can be rigged, leave it to a banker to figure out how to do it. 


@_date: 2019-01-20 00:52:17
Yeah but that market is most disrupted as bitcoin adoption increases. 
What are the fee's on that shit? And what is in the best interest of every person who holds one currency and wants a different one? Probably lower fee's to simply swap a currency.... 
Holding bitcoin and selling it for the dying currencies as we travel is going to be great.

When it was $1 yeah
When it was it was $10 - $100 sure
But it's a currency if the "bottom" is above $1,000 after 10 years of this bullshit. We're all finding out in a few months if the floor is above $1,000, it can't sit at $3k forever. 
Governments cant create one. They run into the same problem we have with fiat currently, the creators have incentive to rig the currency for their own agenda. The agenda should be sound money.

What about the rupee not storing value for 30 years and Indian's still be obsessed with gold because it can't be rigged by RBI?

less than 1% of the world has adopted bitcoin over 10 years. 
if that number EVER moves to 2-3% it's a self fulfilling prophecy that more people will value it as money over time. 
innovations to transact and store bitcoin only increase over time. 
Fiat currencies will die during this same period...
Watch the rupee, real, Argentine peso, lira, ruble all up against USD, GBP and EUR on the global market. 
Every currency fighting to show "value" with the yuan gaining traction and wanting more on the SDR (Global reserve currency)
Buy gold or buy bitcoin....there are only two "global" assets that regular people can hold to store value during this period. Either one is not going to be manipulated by the global markets, currencies are all shit though.

It can't replace fiat in our lifetime.

This remained after the US stopped backing their dollar with gold because everyone owned so many dollars from the past 30 years after the Bretton Woods Agreement. Other countries agreed because it would talk their economies at the time if they didn't?


Everyone should know this... and the countries with currencies that are pegged to the dollar MIGHT not want USD to be the global reserve currency every time they disagree with US policies or actions. 
Not arguing, your post is good.

It doesnt work that way for that very reason though. 
The mining part is for making it equally possible to solve the math problem for all miners... they have to do work and verify it before a bitcoin can be "created" -- whatever the Petro that Maduro tried was just a digital token that has been laughed at since he announced it. Its a printed digital currency pretending to be something valuable...nope. 
Bitcoin is for anyone to mine, hold, sell, transfer... there is never been a technological way to fairly "create money" like proof of work has done for bitcoin. 
People new to it act like this is a small detail, it's huge though because central banks arent needed to prove that a monetary item exists people value globally. Plus it cant be rigged due to the other miners wanting to mine the bitcoin they dont get and do work for, it's brilliant really.
