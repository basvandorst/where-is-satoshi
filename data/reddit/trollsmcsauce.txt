Never said he did, Johny was the one who called the university and contacted the department head to get Howards info, then let Auto contact him as he was on the west coast and was supposed to try meet him.

Very possible, or at least the last nail in the coffin.

Going tk be exciting watching my labcoin shares become even more utterly worthless.
I also changed my public address to bitcoim qt so I can sign just in case. Its not official that you need to sign its good to have the ability incase the issuer requests it.
If you want to risk it go ahead, it aint our shares or money.

Don't even bother with this troll all he does is lie just like labcoin go and read the rest of his worthless comments that reddit deemed useless to even show in the thread lol.
@_date: 2013-10-06 02:29:56
You must be mentally retarded. Doesn't pay him the full amount, after disappearing for months. 
Alessia, said she has never heard of Labcoin, a clear lie, Howard met Fabrizzio in person, another lie, since Fabrizzio said he knows nothing about the company.
Lied about tapeout dates. Currently have 0GH.
Please try to fail more.

This Labcoin sock puppet is in every thread defending them lmfao, with bogus lies. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 23:50:32
I for one hope for my sake that it does have a happy ending, so much precious BTC worth nothing lol
@_date: 2013-10-06 15:14:39
I'm glad he posted this info, i've followed Labcoin all along and have lost, over 60BTC, and didn't know some of the stuff he has put up here.
We should donate BTC for him taking the time and putting everything together like this.

Guys Howard responded to Q/A that people in IRC  emailed him. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 04:48:45
The only troll here is you.  Its been all over the forums Fabrizio always denied involment saying I know nothing and "Sam" runs everything.
Before the forums went down, a user messeged Alessia on facebook and she denied ever being involved with Labcoin.
Also, please show me where a QA with the head engineer is posted anywhere? Ohh yes such useless content this is, to speak to the person who is still listed under Labcoin and who designed the chip.
Clearly your such an honorable user of reddit with so many days under your belt, clearly knows nothing about the situation or cares enough to keep up to date, but please do enlighten us with your useless words about a topic you clearly know nothing about, and by your lack of knowledge shows your lack of caring.
Or it shows that your just a sock puppet that you accuse everyone of being, by making bogus fail arguments.

HOWARD WANG Responses about LabCoin, proves it's a complete scam: 
@_date: 2013-10-06 15:26:10
^^ This lmao
@_date: 2013-10-06 05:29:31
Fail, his post is filled with actual proof, like Fabrizzio admitting to be Sam Noi. Nice try your - points shows what a great job your doing at trying to PUMP your failed labcoin investment.
Are you Fabrizzio/Sam?
@_date: 2013-10-06 14:00:15
My initial conclusion of you being a retard is correct. No you don't own your mistakes you twist them.
agath&gt; who are you? &lt;route69&gt; Fabrizio Tatti &lt;route69&gt; the owner of iTec Pro Limited, behind Labcoin &lt;route69&gt; this is the official presentation, here I am writing, but with the name of the nominee director (Samuel Noi) that I took the company in Hong Kong &lt;route69&gt; because I want to avoid direct exposure, various risks, etc.
Good job purposely leaving out the rest of the transcript. God such a scumbag you are just like Labcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-06 14:27:51
Something I just thought about. At this point I think Labcoin is going to fail, and Fabrizzio/Sam is planning for it's potential demise.
That's why in the "Sam" Q/A, He distanced himself and Alessia, by saying Fabrizzio and Alessia have nothing to do with the project anymore, I have bought the project from them.
LOL Fabrizzio, has bought the project from himself, again he is just distancing himself and everyone involved before he decides to close down shop. 
Being the idiot that he is, he doesn't realize he has already incriminated himself more than once, and if he tries to run away he will end up in jail with all this proof against him and Labcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-06 05:08:30
I have seen nowhere where Alessia has claimed to have never heard of Labcoin"
Already getting caught in your lies.
Actually it wasnt crimson it was a different user,  she was going to call the police because she said I have never heard of labcoin, someone is using my name. Speak to my brother. 
"I don't know who has used my name, I certainly did not write those words, i will call the police."
Please read this to educate yourself:  
Again nice fail, and now you will just be ignored as you have clearly proven to be a troll.
@_date: 2013-10-06 01:10:30
Yeah hop on in the IRC channel  Johnybigs got his email address, and Auto emailed him questions.
Ask the people there they will confirm everything, there is another set of questions, which Howard gave vague responses, then he replied again with these in-depth ones.
@_date: 2013-10-06 02:56:11
Yes you mentioning 0-day accounts as a form of defamation is clearly a sign of a rational being. Bitcointalk is down so this is the next medium to communicate. 
My 0-day status doesn't change the facts, you seem butthurt, what's the matter? holding on to a big bag of Labcoin worthless securities?
@_date: 2013-10-06 05:22:43
Labcoin wow very informative kinda glanced through it before. Also, when "Sam" Fabrizzio did the QA he's IP was from Italy which shows Fabrizzio and Sam are the same person not like him admitting himself wasnt proof enough.
Feel free to link to howards responses in your post.
