I thought that the whole point of it was a joke.  Not in the insulting way, but that it genuinely was not meant to be taken seriously.  In fact the first 10 or so times I saw the doge tip bot on Reddit I thought it was just taking the mickey out of the Bitcoin tip bot.
For my part I believe that Bitcoin will do well in the long term because from what I can tell there was as much thought put into the economics of it as there was into the technical side whereas a lot of the altcoins are simply saying "I don't like X about Bitcoin, so I'll change it."  It does seem though that Dogecoin has this amazing community which is something which no protocol changes could bring about.

I think that the zero-trust model that decentralisation gives you is a killer feature of cryptocurrencies, but I think that is only one of the killer features.
If I were a country's treasury or the Federal Reserve, I'm pretty sure I'd PREFER a cryptocurrency to a physical one **if** I could own all the miners (I don't understand enough of the bitcoin protocol to know if this is possible with the current protocol, or would be possible with modifications.)
By doing this, a country would be able to have all the control over their monetary policy which they presently do while getting the advantages of a currency based on a distributed ledger and completely eliminating currency forgery.
Of course the law enforcement branches of government might be against this because of the anonymity/pseudonymity aspect of cryptocurrencies but I do believe that a cryptocurrency under government control would be more appealing to that government than a physical currency.

Not only that, but it doesn't look like they even thought to ask the spokesperson whether the mails from senior executives were genuine.
