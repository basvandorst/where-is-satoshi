OK. But why is there a "defacto official symbol" for bitcoin when BTC was already the official abbreviation?

Nah, I've seen the movie. He admits to having inherited the name and that the original is living like a king in Patagonia.

So use coinbase until your $1 million, and then see what your monthly sales via BTC are. Less than $3000/mo, stay with coinbase (same 1% fee as bitpay). If it's enough more than $3000/mo to justify the hassle of switching, move to bitpay.

Blockchain.info allows you to do custom transactions, so you could do this. But you had to import the paper wallet before doing the transaction, so I would consider it a part of your blockchain.info wallet now, so I'm not sure I'd recommend this. Better to specify the change goes to a new paper wallet.


Blockchain and (I believe) multibit let you do this. But does it matter? Your software wallet has X addresses that sum to 20BTC. You want 10BTC to go to a new paper wallet. Why do you care which addresses are used to fund the transaction? But yes, some clients let you pick the funding addresses.


I don't understand this question. You can see the transaction details on sites like blockchain.info. The change address will be one your bitcoin software controls, so as long as you backup and secure your bitcoin software's database, you'll control the coins... even though they're no longer in your paper wallet. Each address has it's own private key, so if you lose the private key to any address, you'll lose the ability to spend from that address. There's no way to generate a private key if you only know it's address, even if you know your other private keys.


Yes. First, there's no such thing as a "change address" really. All bitcoin transactions have 1 or more source addresses and 1 or more destination addresses. To be valid, the transaction is signed by the private keys of all the source addresses. Any remainder that isn't sent to an address is the "fee" collected by the miner. When you say tell bitcoin software "I want to send 5BTC to address X with the standard fee", it creates a transaction using 1 or more source address it controls with 5BTC going to X, an unspent fee, and any remainder going to another address it controls. This might be the same or it might be a different address.
Some wallet software lets you create a custom transaction specifying all the details of a transaction. You can also use brainwallet.org to create a custom transaction. So you can create a transaction like "10BTC from A to B, and 40BTC from A to A."


There's no paper wallet algorithm. It's a QR code containing the wallet address and a QR code containing the private key. To spend, you import the private key and how the transaction is formed depends on the software you use.

'they' who? Title makes it sound like someone from congress was making a statement about BTC.

If you're going to use someone elses bandwidth, it's better just to get a VPS and install tor on that. Some Virtual and private server vendors are tor friendly, but most that are don't really advertise that fact. Basically read the TOS carefully and make sure running an exit node doesn't violate any terms.
With a VPN, you're still limited to whatever your home internet is. With a VPS, you're limited their internet capacity, which is likely to be much higher. (It's not impossible to do much better than 100Mbps with a VPS.) should be of some help.
Also note that you *can* firewall your exit node and even tell tor which services you allow. So you could, for example, allow IRC, HTTPS, and IMAP but not HTTP or SMTP. Tor will chose a different exit node for traffic that it can't terminate via yours.

Or have them hand you the cash and deposit it (if bank accepts it, then it's good, right?). After depositing, release the funds.

Person calls MoneyPak and claims fraud. They still have the physical card, remember. Scammers who have been [getting marks to pay them with MoneyPak]( probably cash out to BTC. Then these people start calling MoneyPak, get refunded and the money is revoked from your PayPal or pre-paid card.
Remember, from GreenDot MoneyPak to GreenDot pre-paid card, it's all in the GreenDot system... money doesn't move, just a spreadsheet updates a balance. From MoneyPak to PayPal it's ACH under the hood, and ACH can be reversed.

Obviously the bitcoin community will be interested, but do any of us make up your customer base? That's the more important question.
I'd say with flat rate offers like the new $30/mo from bitinstant and the no-fees on the first million offered by coinbase (make sure instant transaction is enabled) there should be little holding you back. You'll have the one time cost of integrating your chosen solution into your website, and any sales you make in BTC come across at a higher profit margin then your credit card orders.


If you use coinbase, you can have them exchange anything received via your merchant API immediately to USD and dump it into your bank account nightly. If you do this, you can absolutely do all of your accounting in USD. If you hold large amounts of it, then I'm not sure... but I'd expect it to be the same as if you held large amounts of CAD, EUR, or MXP. FinCEN said they intend to treat it as currency, afterall. I'd recommend talking to a CPA if you don't intend to use the instant exchange option.
**Edit** Sounds like bitpay also has the same instant exchange feature.

I didn't say official symbol, did I? Don't strawman so you fight an argument; I asked a question.
BTC is the official *abbreviation* provided by the Bitcoin Foundation. No other currency seems to use BTC as a symbol, so it seems it should have been free to use for a symbol as well. It does clash with a stock ticker (on a couple of exchanges, actually) but so do lots of other currencies (ex: ZAR, INR, AUD, CAD, etc). I always thought it was OK for symbols to clash if they're on different markets; that's why you usually specify the ticker as well as the market unless it's safe to assume the market is known.
But I guess I have the answer to my question: XBT is the trading symbol Bloomberg choose. You don't know why, but it was probably a good reason. Anyway, I appreciate your insight.

Which part? v1.1.18 was released at the same time as 2.0.4 back in [Feb 2013]( 2.0.5 was released [Aug 2013]( to fix some new vulnerabilities that don't affect the 1.x branch.
1.x is clearly still receiving security updates, which by definition means it's supported.
@_date: 2013-10-06 15:39:53
Thanks! XE gives a good reason for the abbreviation choice:


Bitcoin is not recognized by the ISO and therefore does not have an official ISO 4217 code. A currency code is generally built from the two-digit ISO 3316 country code and a third letter for the currency. Although "BTC" is often used in the Bitcoin community, BT is the country code of Bhutan. An X-code reflects currencies that are used internationally and so, XE has chosen to use XBT to represent Bitcoin.

No, like I said, it implies either he did *or* he's about to. He never made any statement about whether or not he was planning to disclose. You presumed.
To use your example, if the boyfriend never even wanted to go to Mexico, then her statement about ending the relationship would be a surprise. That's the situation here. Nobody's thinking about Mexico and nobody's thinking about disclosing...

You could export the particular private key print it to a paper wallet, but you still need to make sure you securely delete the key from the computer. Easier just to print a new paper wallet and transfer coins to that afterwards.
@_date: 2013-10-04 23:37:34
When I did that I got something about some XBT client, "Expendable bathythermograph", xbt torrent tracker... nothing that looked relevant.
@_date: 2013-09-26 20:33:29


This statement implies that he already did or is about to disclose. So, that's where.

You don't know what style means, do you? The definitions are exactly the same. It's the emphasis that's changed.

Look on localbitcoins.com. Lots of people are accepting lots of different payment options for selling BTC (including PayPal! Gah!)
Because MoneyPak markets their cards as irreversible, they have been accepted as a safe way to accept payment for online trades. Turns out they're not really any safer than other electronic methods.
@_date: 2013-10-09 01:25:02
This is not a grammar issue. "cannot" and "can not" have different emphasis; a good writer knows when to use one instead of the other. Grammatically, either is correct, but stylistically one is going to be a better choice than another.
In this case, I have to disagree with you and side with @_date: 2013-10-09 01:46:16


This one is a bit hard. You can use multiple layers of VPN purchased with BTC, I suppose, but tor is pretty slow... can you sustain ssh connections over tor and do anything useful? Or will you have to wait 3 seconds between each keypress, making it unusable for anything non-scripted.

One of the main points of paper wallets is cold storage - the private key has never had a chance of being stolen. For example: there have been virus's that have targeted bitcoin-qt installs on windows and stolen people's bitcoins. Paper wallet is generally considered more secure/safe for long term storage of large amounts.
You can't really use bitcoin on offline PCs*. But you can store your 100BTC on a paper wallet, transfer it to a PC/Cellphone to spend some, then transfer the balance to a new, secure paper wallet.
(*Technically you can generate offline transactions and then use a different, online computer to broadcast the transaction. Armory supports this.)
@_date: 2013-09-30 16:48:26
Blockchain.info sends change to the primary address. Most software clients (bitcoinqt, multibit, etc) use an address you haven't used yet or generate a new one, AFAIK.
So it should really be:  
    +-------+
    | paper |
    +-------+
        |
        V
    +--------------------------+
    | import key into multibit |
    +--------------------------+
        |
        +------------------------+ (paper wallet now empty)
        |                        |
        V                        V
    +--------------------+    +----------------------------------------------+
    | destination (1BTC) |    | change address controlled by multibit (4BTC) |
    +--------------------+    +----------------------------------------------+
The paper wallet is now empty, but you still control your BTC. They're in one of the many addresses (public/private key pairs) that multibit controls.
The real PSA should be quite simple:  
To spend a paper wallet you need to import its ~~public~~ private key. You've now exposed your paper wallet's key to the digital world. Destroy the paper and make good backups until you've transferred any funds you wish to cold-store back to *a new* paper wallet.

Considering they didn't get any child pornographers when they hacked and later shut down that tor based hosting company, I'd say it's probably safe.
There's not much LE and politicians like more than arresting child pornographers. Were they able to identify any, they would have. Instead they shut down the anonymous web host that many of them were utilizing.

Every once and a while I see people abbreviate bitcoin as XBT instead of BTC. What's up with that? I haven't seen that abbreviation published anywhere (bitcoin wikis, bitcoin blogs). Is it the result of some non-english translation?

They definitely tout anonymous receiving of messages.  But, yeah, [in the video]( he talks about using it through TOR, so sender must not be hard to figure out.
Big concern I have is there's been no professional audit yet. But I suppose you could GPG encrypt your message, paste it into bitmessage, and just use bitmessage to help distribute and obscure? Meh... you could use TOR and post encrypted messages on random public forums, too, though. Isn't there a tor based email client, too?
@_date: 2013-10-09 01:43:12
Still, he did out himself via several means (stackexchange, web forums, youtube video [this one's not as strong]). Unless they hacked those sites and inserted fake time stamps (as well as inserted backups into archive.org, then the story is at least believable whether that's actually how they caught him or just convenient to tell the press.
The next guy won't make those mistakes, so they'll either have to admit the NSA helped or have a harder time creating the alternate story.
