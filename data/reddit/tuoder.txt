I don't know what's going on over there. If you ever find a no-reserve auction starting at $0.01, those tend to settle near fair market value.

Bitinstant and Getbitcoin have done that. If you're going to use that, though, you could just use a money order.

I'm guessing they had the problem with another vender with an identical situation.

A lot of SR sellers require FE, especially if they are highly reputable.

It's sort of proof he/she did it. This kind of thing is easy to fake.

I had an order in June which I funded with a money order which went smoothly enough. They missed their 24 hour turnaround, but they refunded the fee, so whatever. 
A couple of weeks ago I sent a money order in and have been waiting and waiting. I sent a message about it, and they said they have to wait for it to clear and that the 24 hour guarantee didn't apply to the situation. It had been 10 days and they hadn't cashed the thing.
So I still don't have my bitcoins and I'm getting suspicious if they'll come.

He gave it away on IRC last time.

I wouldn't say they took them. I'd say they lost them. They don't really know at this point who had how much. They lost a lot of bitcoins and had no backup.

It's pretty volatile right now. It's hard to tell which way it will go, how far, and how fast.

Like they said, it wasn't being used.
@_date: 2012-05-30 06:55:29
Of course they did. It would be very simple to call and claim you never received the BTC and you could double your money.

In Protestant Christianity, gambling is a sin (for most denominations). They saw it is a foreign and a Catholic thing. Furthermore, it has not traditionally been thought of as productive economic activity. If you think of it as entertainment, it all becomes subjective. I have a hard time imagining being entertained by visiting a casino, but to each their own. I'd love to own one. Fundamentally, people pay for tiny chance of a fortune, but squander the fortune they have in the process. To me, this is enough of a reason to restrict it or make it illegal.
As time went on and the mob started gambling operations, states dealt with it in different ways. They held their own lotteries as a form of voluntary taxation. They legalized it on boats (to discourage downtown casino areas from forming and promoting other lewd and lascivious activity [or that was the thinking, anyway]). Later, there was Las Vegas. Montana has mini casinos in all of the major gas stations. Every state is different.

If you sort by top you can see the topic has been thoroughly discussed. There's no reason to hold a thread every day for people who are too lazy/stupid to search.

I think that those are both things which people can generally be trusted to not harm others with, but you've really got to be kidding me if you think people never do harm with guns or money.

If you insist on having the whole blockchain yourself, that's how long it takes. Otherwise, use an online wallet or something like Electrum.

I don't follow. I'm not saying I agree with the above, I'm just presenting the reasoning that was used to make it illegal. I'm also not sure how what you're saying is related to what I'm saying. Personally, I'm an atheist and a gun owner.

Sounds like the RAM was defective or run too hot for too long.

That's weird. It worked for me. Maybe he just wanted to cash out the Reddit Gold he had and see if he could scam up a few coins to go with it. Or maybe he got overwhelmed and decided to shut down and keep the money.
