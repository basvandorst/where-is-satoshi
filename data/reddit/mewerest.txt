This is nothing more than an appeal to my wallet. I can see what you are feeling with this statement alone, that there will be a better bitcoin, block chainium 4.0, that you will miss out on the gainz. This is literally scaling because of potential FOMO and that is incredibly weak for an investor to feel this way.

crypto genius reveals new bitcoin
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:17:00
All you have to do is realize that the vast majority of these cryptos do not gain anything by not being settled in bitcoin. The fact that 99% can be side chains proves they are still overvalued.
Monero is the only one I wouldn't want to be a side chain for obvious reasons. It and maybe 2 other cryptos are nice to have as a separate chain
@_date: 2018-09-24 15:05:31
Fair enough. The argument that we need to push something through because new investors is a tired argument to me. You only owning bitcoin does not change your ability to be manipulated by that kind of appeal. The biggest innovations with LN will be around UI. Eventually it will be secure and easy to the point that it's not a concern if the base layer is expensive to transact on. Think about how many times you in your life have used a certified check for something. I am pretty sure I have only ever had to use one like 5 times that I can recall. That is akin to the base layer to me.  I don't mind that layer being expensive, I really don't. If that means I'm pushing out the people that are only into crypto for free transactions, so be it. I don't think they add much anyway.

Think of it like an incompatible hard fork (BTC vs BCH), I was never going to switch to bcash. Why would I? I would have to be economically be forced to switch over for me to switch over. Without a real flippening, I would absolutely not agree to some hard fork. Same thing here.

The only people holding USDT instead of crypto or a real fiat are idiots waiting to be scammed.
the fact that USDT's market cap hasn't taken a huge hit proves to me it is fraudulent. There is no reason to hold USDT over USD in a bear market other than it's not possible to sell for USD. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 02:50:50
they add to the security and decentralization of the network. Every single full archival node adds a marginal amount of both.
Some people will argue that they do nothing.  They are wrong because they are being reductionist. They are claiming that the marginal utility by any node at this point is so small that you can round to zero the effect. But you can't...its a small number, but it's not zero.
@_date: 2018-09-24 04:08:28
Numerous reasons, like how they tried to force a hard fork. 
From here on out, just about every hard fork will be contentious. It takes overwhelming consensus to agree to a hard fork. I don't see it happening again unless it's similar to the overflow bug that had to be rolled back.
If a fork is contentious , the safest bet will be to not take the hard fork update, lest it end up being another bcash and you end up a bagholder. 
So what does that mean? That means most people will wait on the main chain to see if the hard fork 'takes'. They will then let the market price decide what happens , during this time they will be susceptible to double spends (assuming the contentious fork does not have reply protection)  so they will most likely not want to spend their coins or even move them around. 
I also strongly disagree that there needs to be both a block size increase and off chain scaling. Saying both are valid and both need to be eventually done is just a form of an argument from moderation, which is a logical fallacy

Clearly we are operating on different definitions.

I don't think miners are being careless, it takes a lot of care and thought to mine.
Extravagantly? also not applicable, they are only using the energy resources available to them to better their lives. Since they are bound to their own private profit motives, it cannot be extravagant.
No purpose - I don't need to say anything about this unless you really think the block chain being secure is no purpose

there was not a soft fork decision made in place of a hard fork. This is a false dichotomy. 
the decision was always hard fork vs non hard fork, which the majority of the community decided to side with not hard forking. And then, the people remaining had the choice of soft work vs non soft fork. 
The reality of the situation was that the majority of the market decided it was smart to not do the risky thing and hard fork when there wasn't clear consensus. 
The big blockers want you to think that it was as simple as segwit vs big blocks, it was not that simple.

Cool, you admit that you don't give a damn about who the burden of proof rests with, got it.


Yes, I point out how they are a scam because they are unable to prove they are a legitimate business. The burden still is with them to prove their original claim.  I guess this is where you get lost, you think someone only has to prove a claim they make if you 'care'. non-sense. 


 non sequitur. The burden of proof still relies on them to prove they are a legitimate business.


Again, the burden of proof never was in my court. I am simply making the logical connections - a business that has proven time and time again unable to prove their legitimacy is infact not legitimate. Gasp. Such a leap in logic.
I can only assume you are taking an emotional defense of Tether because you are afraid of them infact being insolvent because it would hurt your BTC balance in the short term. I hope you are not over-invested for your own sake. You might not even realize this is why you are taking this stance - but obviously anyone that has to jump through these mental gymnastics is infact defending the institution in question.

I'll walk you through this since you need help. From the top, do you agree that the burden of proof rests on Tether to prove they are backed by USD? I can ONLY assume that your brilliance has not blinded you that this is the starting point. 
If so, Yes, this is where your critical thinking has absolutely failed you. If someone can not prove their claim you disregard it out of hand! Without proof of an audit, there is absolutely no reason for me to entertain the idea that USDT is anything but a scam. I mean for fuck's sakes look at all the evidence around you. The *very idea* that USDT's supply would not decrease in this bear market by a VERY substantial amount does not pass the smell test. Have you read their TOS? YOU REALIZE WITHDRAWALS AREN'T A THING RIGHT? 
And honestly, you really do not get it. Your pathetic attempt at attacking my posting legit made me lol, especially how you try and paint me as a noob! LOL! I have been around since 2013 in bitcoin circles, I can only assume you are relatively new since anyone that had frequented the bitcoin forums over the last few years has seen so many scams that they would just flat out know better.

It likely will hurt bitcoin's present day valuation but I dont give a damn. It's wrongly valued if tether is propping up the price. Bitcoin is far stronger than some fiat token anyway. 
I absolutely disagree with the other commentators saying tether's implosion will hurt bitcoin. It will only shake weak hands from the market. Fuck them, if tether imploding causes you to panic sell then any number of things would make you panic sell. 
Tether imploding is a good thing because it shouldn't have even been accepted as USD. Anyone that fucked with tether played with fire and they need to be burned.

I paid 1 million dollars for a piece of paper that says I own the Eiffel tower. When it becomes known that the paper is fake, the value I had in that piece of paper also disappears. I can't just tell someone, well hey this piece of paper still retains SOME value because I put into it so much.
the people that would actually hold USDT fall into a few camps
1. They liked the idea of stable USD coin (for what you said, waiting on the sidelines for volatility in crypto to calm down). These people will be hurt because of their ignorance.
2. They were unable to get registered with a KYC/AML exchange to buy/sell their bitcoin for fiat. This can be for numerous reasons like they were criminals or they live in a nation that is unable to get a fiat USD bank account with legitimate means. Like a venezuelan, you cannot own USD in a USD bank account so in your mind you think USDT is "just as good". These people will be hurt because they were unable to use the best method available ("real fiat", USD) so they used a substitute product.
The people that fall into camp 1) will (most likely) just buy straight bitcoin and hold for years while volatility subsides. Camp 2) will have to deal with black market OTC exchanges, raises fees in the process for themselves because of the middle men. Going forward they will have to put in real (read, 'real' fiat) to buy bitcoin. That will help 'bring' value to bitcoin going forward but the lost money in USDT is gone forever.
I mean, would you accept USDT for your bitcoin? I wouldn't. I wouldn't even sell 1 btc for 20k in USDT. It's worthless to me. Get that shit away from me.
We are quickly approaching the point where USDT starts to lose its peg and anyone that is still selling BTC for USDT is just gambling.
@_date: 2018-10-15 15:57:29

More or less but at this point the market is baking in that expected supply drop. Last time there was a halvening the peak approached before the actual halvening and I imagine it will happen like that again this time

I cannot blame you. This last year was insane. We hit 20,000 and I was seriously having panic attacks. I always knew bitcoin would go up but not like that.
We are not many years away from 1.3k bitcoin being only possible due to the mtgox trading bot. There has been fud and fud.
You just have to have perspective, breath, relax, and enjoy the liars putting out fud. I can only lol at the many posts now. 
I turned off my radeon 4850 when it was only mining me 1$ a day. When bitcoin was 7$.

As long as you're admitting you're trusting the 'evidence' provided by Binance on faith alone that Binance is credible, go ahead. You're probably even right.
Just realize that trust but verify is a thing for a reason is all I'm saying.

Close to the bottom he speculates 
@_date: 2018-11-01 22:04:33


bro this is shit evidence. A screenshot of the original is not proof, there needs to be a DKIM analysis to have evidence.
This is entirely ignoring the fact that the altered emails change NOTHING. I had to re-read them multiple times because I was sure I was missing something big, but nope any differences in the emails is not worth anything
@_date: 2018-11-24 12:22:47
I know right? Cmc is complicit as fuck
@_date: 2018-11-01 22:11:42
Am I high? What is the significance of the altered emails? I keep on reading them but I am unable to see what he allegedely altered that changed the context of the emails?
This just sounds like a redherring, for binance to point to and be like "ah-HA! clearly you have no credibility" 
besides if binance was serious about 'proving' he altered the emails they would have posted the DKIM keys not a screenshot. Like come on.
Sounds like a lot of people commenting are just jealous as fuck that he has this much bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-24 13:20:00
Shitpay needs to go bankrupt
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:20:10
Because it's stupid. Paying with bitcoin at this point in time is dumb. It means you likely deal with increased fees. You paying with bitcoin = shitpay sells your bitcoin and converts it to fiat 95% of the time.
If someone gives me a bitcoin discount I will gladly use it. If I have to pay extra it is simply illogical as fuck to do so.
The idea that volatility will go away with people buying some block stream stickers is nonsensical.
Bitcoin is a brand new currency. It's going to take years to be a preferred medium of exchange. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:32:57
No, it's the fact that you can sell the parts piecemeal for a small percentage more than they are worth because of the rarity. 
Think about it like this, if you had a small part that breaks on your car you will need another one. It will likely cost you a upcharge over what it would be worth when you buy the entire car. Now imagine it's a small part that's not made by the factory anymore because it's a super car.
@_date: 2018-11-01 22:17:33
……………..That's not evidence. This is he said she said bullshit. A screenshot from binance is a straight joke as it could EASILY be altered just like they accuse him of doing.
Real evidence would be binance showing the DKIM key. 
Also I truly fail to see the significance of the altered emails. It's supposed to make it sound like binance is deciding when to help or not? Like I don't get what is such a big deal about this. All sounds like a redherring to me.

It sucks because the wait period is a big ? but this is the absolute best way to handle a contentious hard fork. 
There's essentially a period where you have to wonder, can I declare the winner yet? Is it time? 
History has shown us that being the first to upgrade to a contentious hard fork (meaning, the fork that is no longer compatible with your current/previous version) has nearly unlimited risk. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 03:06:43
So we should just ignore the content of someone's message and straw man it?
Do you even understand what a cost:benefit analysis is?  It doesn't seem like it. I said for a proper discounted price it would behoove me to spend my bitcoin. I have outlined my proper reasons for this, and your response is ignore that and strawman me. 
If you want to spend more than you need to, to pretend you are helping bitcoin, feel free. Exchanges and intermediaries like bitpay need you.

I have been around since 2012-2013. I feel like you got fat and happy. This isnt anything but a blip. 
Remember all the bitcoin talk threads from back in the day? Just put yourself back in 2013 and think about the future of bitcoin crashing to 3000. That should put this in perspective

Where is your proof to make such claims?
Clearly you have evidence to back up what you claim. I mean theres no way you would say such a thing on a gut feeling
@_date: 2019-01-26 20:36:52
No, really you're just giving bitpay/exchanges a good percentage cut by spending and replacing 
People should only spend bitcoin when it makes sense to them economically, and to me that means if I can get a bitcoin discount like I can on apmex
@_date: 2018-11-01 22:07:43


5. Binance wants you to waste your time and run you around in circles until you give up
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:05:25
Do you not realize how stupid it is to ask for a source for an anecdote? 
Lol. Today I learn how if someone cannot cite a CNN article nothing happened.
Y que divertido, lo es pendejo - no pandejo. Pandejo no es una palabra :)
Dipshit atleast appropriate my culture correctly.
But here's a source that proves what I said is completely plausible :) 
@_date: 2019-01-26 23:59:08
I probably assumed you implied otherwise because your overall message will cost consumers more money using intermediaries. Spending and replacing gives exchanges money, for little to no benefit to you the consumer.
It makes no economical sense for me to pay with bitcoin for regular price just because of the fact that I have to now worry about the tax implications. 
I dont know about you but I dont have time to worry about logging all the times I bought or sold bitcoin just to make a poor signal to vendors that they should consider accepting bitcoin. 
Btw, you buying something in bitcoin is not at all a signal to vendors that they need to accept/continuing accepting bitcoin unless you are a brand new customer OR buying more than previous because of the bitcoin option. If their sales are not growing because of bitcoin it is inconsequential.
@_date: 2018-11-01 22:29:04
Ya and i'm with you on that but I'm just at a loss for words for why the altered emails even are a point of contention. Like I literally do not see how the wording changes anything. I guess it just makes it sound like binance was willfully fucking him over more in his altered version
@_date: 2019-01-09 14:54:29
Why would anyone use them now lol

@_date: 2019-01-30 00:32:07


No one likes unnecessary ad hominems. You strawmaned my comment, calm down that you got called on it.


I never once said that we shouldn't spend bitcoin until tax implications are gone. That's a strawman at best, fabricating words at worse. You took my comment and tried to do the "so what you're saying is" thing. That's a common way people fall into strawmaning an argument. My comment wasn't that long, if you had that much confusion about it you should have just read it twice. I cannot think you acted in good faith, and instead just lashed out because I disagreed with you. Anyways.


 I said when it makes economic sense to me to spend my bitcoin I will. That means I have to look at the totality of the situation, and when I factor in my labor to take into account tax implications I generally will be losing **unless** I get a discount for spending my bitcoin. Usually.
There are a few situations where it makes sense for me to use bitcoin without a discount. Like if I am buying a used car, I would rather use bitcoin than get a cashier's check because of the fees. Another situation is if I have some bitcoins that are **ahem** off the books so to say, and I then do not have to worry about doing taxes for any transactions using them. Or if I wanted to get something off the black market...
I strongly disagree with 'spend and replace' bitcoin for many reasons but the biggest one is that the business I am sending bitcoins to is probably just going to sell them the second they get them anyway. If they were a business that only accepted and transacted in bitcoin then I would be super excited to give them my business. The reasons should be obvious if you ask me. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 03:23:55

It has to be a super majority. if you just have 51% heading into a scheduled hard fork, it will likely crumble from people backing out as they realize they might be betting on the wrong side.

You know you're talking to a mental midget when they open with "uh" and finish with "Try again?"  
Like I implied by stating a pruned node, a full archival node does not take up the space you stated. You can now proceed with shifting the conversation away from definitions and continue explaining on how saving every single state is totally unnecessary.
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:25:41
The numbers you reference are in regards to pruned nodes. I post this because you said you were not sure where he got that info, obviously I assume you did not know and were not just pretending that full archival nodes take up that little of space.

Yeah when someone is pushing a bitcoin to the moon article across all platforms then i would say they are trying to manipulate public sentiment. This article showed up in my news feed as well as my roommate and he has never even googled crypto ever.
Atleast try and compare apples to apples. No one looks clever burning down a strawman.

if you had told me in 2015 that bitcoin would be around 4000 a coin and that people were talking about it dying I wouldn't even believe you

i mean if you look at the historical price chart it clearly went sideways for a bit at 800$ but it definitely never hit 1800$. and took so long to actually fall to 200 that it's almost wrong to say it's a crash 
So yeah, I'm thinking he's just misremembering or straight up lying
@_date: 2018-12-29 05:01:33
It is a good thing.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:02:46
No, this is not an apples to apples comparison. You just said a blanket term of "pro bitcoin". 
If a pro bitcoin article gets pushed this heavily (meaning, someone is paying to spread it, even to people that have no idea what bitcoin is) then yes that is obviously attempting to manipulate public sentiment. 
There is a reason you have to try and leave some emotionally laced "you bitcoin crazies" comment. It's because you have a weak point to make. There is a reason you have to build strawman.

The article has already been debunked and yet you can't see that it's just fake news meant to shake weak hands.
The people that manipulated bitcoin upwards convinced dolts to buy at 19k and they are the same people trying to get them to sell now so they can do it again.

You're very nearly concern trolling here. The issues were the transaction spam and that major exchanges were not batching transactions.
