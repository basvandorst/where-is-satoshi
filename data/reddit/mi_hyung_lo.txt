More like voluntary contribution to the government since unlike taxes, the lottery is not mandatory and you won't go to jail for refusing to participate.

You're an eternal optimist? :)

And? That has nothing to do with the lottery being an "extra taxation of the poor". Taxes are mandated by the government and are involuntary. There is no mandate to buy a lottery ticket. It is completely voluntary.

Fuck Obama, Bush, Trump, Republicans, Democratics  and any other statist fucks that want government mandated weakened encryption.  They want to catch child pornographers? They want to catch terrorists? They want to catch &lt;insert weak rationale here&gt; they can bloody well stop wasting resources on the failed war on drugs and have law enforcement do some old fashioned police work.  Law abiding citizens shouldn't have to give up strong encryption in order to make governments job easier. We have no responsibility, morale or otherwise, to make the job of leos easy.  Every fucking body has their cross to bear when it comes to working hard within their chosen occupations and leos should be no different.

I listed Trump.  I listed Obama first because he was the one in the video. I listed Bush second because he is the asshole that put the building of the Republican/Democratic police state infrastructure in high gear.
