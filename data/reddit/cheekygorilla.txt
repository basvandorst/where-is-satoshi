@_date: 2017-12-25 18:23:45
Because it gives some accountability and less market manipulation 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:19:15
They aren't bonds, like you said originally, it's speculation 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:33:51
Can you imagine everytime you trade having to pay $50? xD
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:45:15
Oh well when it first came out there were no mining programs or pools. All fast mined
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:52:15
[Take a look at the tx fees]( and maybe you would understand better
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:17:52

@_date: 2017-03-29 01:20:39
true. I'm just mad that I sold all my darkcoin! I should have kept mining. Even then I told myself I was too late yet still could have had a masternode -___-
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:17:28
Some coins I can mine now for $3-$5 a day on a 1080 so it is profitable with some coins still
@_date: 2017-03-22 05:30:25

@_date: 2017-03-25 20:24:47

@_date: 2017-08-22 07:01:05
It wasn't 360 satoshi it was 260. Regardless, the transaction speed hasn't changed from what it seems. I was curious what the fork actually changed.
