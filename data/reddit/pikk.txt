because every individual will need to hire their own police force and mercenaries with which to defend themselves. 
that sounds a lot like having your own little fiefdom.

People vote on shit they don't understand all the time. How do you think we ended up with the two awful parties that we have now? 
(most) People just pick whichever box accords with what their authority figure of choice has told them to do. Whether it's their preacher, their news station, or their echo chamber of online message boards.

I don't see how bitcoin is able to defend your home from thieves or foreign invaders.

so, a return to feudalism then?

I have a feeling more people would subscribe to the REA/DRO that always decides in their favor, rather than the one that's the best at not using force.

fair enough. I can imagine a post scarcity world where war is no longer economically viable, but it requires a lot more than bitcoin. Other technologies will need to come of age too, like extraterrestrial resource collection, widespread 3d printing, and fusion energy.

Things were getting better for a while there in the post-war era. Civil rights legislation, government focus on space exploration, expansion of student aid. And then the 80s happened, and fuck.

how do you have a free market on government? It'd be impossible to know who had jurisdiction where. Crossing the city might run you through 20 different municipalities. Humans have done this before. Cities were a thing, City states were a thing, then Nation-states, then Nations. World government is the direction of greatest efficiency and least conflict.

well, they cover their costs by looting their opponents. That's historically how wars have been fought.

you can always take people as slaves.

But if America wasn't one country, and instead, a whole bunch of tiny private entities, none of them would have nuclear weapons. Or, the one that did would take over all the others in very short order. 
The reason there aren't wars anymore is because all the countries have either gotten big enough to be a huge pain in the ass to deal with (russia, EU), or are so small that there's no (large-scale) profit to be made from engaging them (the middle east). 
If America were 500, or 5000, or 5 million small entities, it'd be a lot easier to take over some, or all of it. If California were invaded by china, are New Yorkers going to be willing to hire mercenaries to help defend it? maybe, maybe not. Might be worth finding out.

how does blockchain(?) make the state obsolete?

Also, you have a very inaccurate view of [how feudal societies worked.]( "The peasants worked his lord's land and paid him certain dues in return for the use of land, the possession (not the ownership) of which was heritable. The dues were usually in the form of 3 days labor on the lord's land." Three days is pretty minimal compared to the 15-35% tax rate we see here in the states today. So, peasants weren't nearly as oppressed as the media likes to portray them, and they certainly weren't forced into "subsistence living" 
for your further viewing pleasure:

currency is bullshit. Who the fuck wants money, when they could get farmland, or textile mills, or slaves for their robot army factories? Ukraine is being slowly taken over by Russia right now. Would having their economy in bitcoin have prevented that? I don't think so.

How difficult is it to get a job without having citizenship? Conversely, how difficult is it to gain citizenship?
