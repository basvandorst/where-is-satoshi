These aren't doctors, physicists, and engineers leaving Africa and the ME to head to Europe.

I'm not worried about QC going mainstream.  I'm worried about that one guy who has his hands on the very first QC.  He shorts, and then he floods the market with bitcoins because he can produce them 1000x faster.  He can then spoof private keys, break hashes, and steal bitcoins because everyone else is running Newtonian computers.

An investment should never be based on hope.  It should be based on a thesis.  What is your thesis for it going up?  A thesis of "well, you never know" is not plausible.
Then you have the issue of opportunity cost.  While your remaining 10% in BTC loses or makes no money, you could have used it to for another investment that made you money.  You lost out.
So no, letting it ride can also be a very bad strategy.

No one wants to use Bitcoin as cash when it swings -5% one day and then +5% the next.  They want stability if it's to be used as money.  Get your act together.
And Bitcoin is not an investment.  It doesn't pay any dividends.

Ok guys, I hate to see so much financial hurt from good people who have big dreams.  So, I'm going to give you some advice.  Take it or leave it.  Sell!!!
I never liked cryptocurrencies.  I have my reasons, and I won't divulge them here because that's my edge in the markets - the ability to see problems that no one else does.  Blockchain has its uses, but not in crypto money.  There are some fundamental issues that have to be worked out first.
However, I will say that the massive run-up to $20k was based on fraudulent buying that the SEC is currently looking into.  It was all fake, designed to pull in suckers, and you fell for it by letting your greed/ego/FOMO take over.  Another run up will have to be contrived by another scam, and that's not going to happen.  Sell!!

Quantum computers just two years away.  Anyone afraid that quantum computers will be able to bust up the hashes and steel your bitcoins away?

Zero since it's not backed by anything.  Even gold has value as jewelry and electronics conductor.

Every home has a chance to be rented out for "dividends".  Ever hear of Airbnb?  But you can't sleep in a bitcoin.

I've been thinking.  This subreddit has 1m users, but the stocks subreddit only has 300k, and stocks are a lot more popular than bitcoin.
What if, of the 1m users, half or even 400k are really Russian bots trying to get the price of bitcoin lower so they can mass accumulate?  They get it down to 1k and pump it back up to 4k to make a 400% profit.  
These russian bots are sneaky too.  The bots say bitcoin has no value, but 10.5 million people will pay $3400 for one bitcoin.  The bots say bitcoin has no use, but businesses around the world will accept it.  It is the first world's currency.  Bitcoin is the cheapest way to send money cross countries.  Ignore these bots or else you'll be beating yourself for selling near the lows.

Let's have reality decide who's right.  BTC reached a new 52 low today.  Well, I guess reality has ruled me right.  BTW, BTC will continue to make new 52 week lows from here on out.
This is not a massaging my ego thing.  I just don't want you guys to lose anymore money.
