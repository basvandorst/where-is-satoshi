I kinda have to agree. I feel like bitcoin, while cool, ultimately doesn't challenge the status quo in a significant way. The regime of capitalism will still reign and poor people will still be poor.  It helps average people move their sliver of profit around more easily (which is good), but it doesn't change the way profit is shared or way work is organised.

What is crony capitalism more specifically and how if their was a magic wand to reform society the way we liked would we organise so that cronyism doesn't take hold again without sustained use of magic? 
When we say Capitalism has improved the lives of *all* humanity I find that a bit dubious. I mean it has given me a better life and it is certainly better than feudalism, but what do you mean when you say that? Also, it is implied that pure capitalism is best. Is that Capitalism without laws or with laws?
Edit: How does bitcoin make people more free under capitalism?

What happens when all providers in your area, or one provider which is common in US, provide equivalent services? Do you recommend people move or just accept it?

Any increase in block size increases centralization to an extent. Why not use 1x with lighting? Simple solution. How will 2x benefit the community long term?

You may not be doing this on purpose but it sounds like you are using two different definitions of centralization and presenting them as equally bad. There is mining centralization which is obviously bad. I think we all agree this is bad. Having one group that writes the best code to keep bitcoin decentralized doesn't mean that we've lost. If only ones person wrote the bittorrent protocol it doesn't make the protocol centralized.

You are correct. If something ridiculous was possible like that than ridiculous behavior would be in order. What is your point exactly? Get out from behind your scarecrow.
