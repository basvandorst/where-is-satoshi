Looks like an arrogant kid who has no sense of reality, if I recollect all pieces that I read on him last days. And probably a scammer as cherry on the cake.

Yeah, I did not search for it, but if someone can seek a link or document that confirms or refutes what is being said :)

I did not find an English version. So here is the French one. Sorry for the misplaced Capital letters :) 
I can translate if you want but this just confirms all previous rumours, since this is an (kind of) official news agency. 
Edit: kind of: Because the website is supported by the gouvernement and supported by the Ch gov this is an  official media outlet for China. But this is not _the_ official media agency of China. My bad.

Hep, it's easier to hide Bitcoin than computers…

Yes, see also the [previous post]( that suggested that Mark moved to Japan precisely because he was sued or going to be sued by his former employer for having kept at home office data. 
I had no coin on MtGox but I guess people would have been more thoughtful if they had tried to decipher the past of this guy before moving hundred of euros onto his account.

Well, the copyright is attributed to [China Internet Information Center](
CIIC is a gouvernement web portal and there are links in the footer to China embassy in France and CCTVFr. I don't know if the journalist can be trusted, but the website is obviously supported by the Chinese gouvernment.

Nope: no leaders is different from no law. You could have laws that everyone is entitled to enforce.

Native french speaker here. I'll add to pixelab:
* Had a high IQ very young and can programm since his 10 years but only has a «baccalaureat». He began to work directly after secondary school in a computer firm. That's where he was accused of «fraud», though this is not explained why or how.
* Mother seems genuinly proud of him. She was very calm during the interview and almost enthousiastic about the capacities of his son. 
* If he was hidden during three days, that was just to take a break before facing difficulties. 
Frankly speaking, she is in adoration before her son and can't even imagine he did anything wrong. This dœs not inform us directly about what happened on MtGox but may explain Mark's caracter: one could expect that a son of that mother might a bit too arrogant and self-confident.

I think you replied to my message that I deleted by error. But yes. See Proudhon. A whole part of his work focus on the disparition of states to have only small entities that may grow into confederation if they want. Small entities = you village/street/paroisse at most

What is worth noting is that Qinghua is arguably one of the most prestigious and progressive university of China. The professors working here often council the governement if they do not directly work within it, like this woman. Yet the liberal part of the CCP is not as stubborned as more conservative officials at the PBoC. If those guys prevails, then Bitcoin will be supported at the highest level of the State in China.
TL;DR: Chinese "liberal communists" support Bitcoin, and they are powerful.

That's a good idea, with the inbuilt reputation system, but you may want to restrict that first to some testing subs
