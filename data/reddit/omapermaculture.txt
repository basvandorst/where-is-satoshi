Wow! Thanks for your help. 
What do I put here "   Do I upload my Bitcoin QR Code to Imgur and link from there?
When I do click on the QR Code I get an error message that reads there is no application set to open the URL bitcoin. Does that not matter since people are scanning the QR Code? Sorry for all the questions.

Ok. I removed the Bitcoin donation button and just posted the QR Code and address. Is this better? I really appreciate your feedback and help!
