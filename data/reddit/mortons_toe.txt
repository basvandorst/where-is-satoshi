I think i can understand where the frustration is coming from. consensus is tough when there are high stakes and complex systems. Makes it hard to innovate and scale quickly.
Think about if the early internet/computing required consensus:
-Imagine if TCP/IP was never rolled out because consensus stated NCP worked just fine.
-Imagine if the GUI was never rolled out because the technical consensus felt command line was sufficient for the average user
-Imagine if IPV6 wasn't proactively adopted by network infrastructure because the consensus ran IPV4.

It was my understanding that transactions get cancelled if they don't confirm in a few days, so a zero fee probably isn't the answer
