Makes sense, why would any credit card company allow the purchasing of bitcoins if you could just claim you never got the bitcoins and they wouldn't be able to tell?
And on that note I feel like an idiot for not doing that.

Yeah but it takes $0 to emotionally invest in bitcoin drama.

Yep, this situation reminds me a load of the 'wild west' of buying a mobile phone in the early 2000s, you had hundreds of different looking ones with different charger ports, some with custom headphone jacks etc.
Eventually one style won out (the flat screen) and the rest is history.
I feel like a load of people assume Bitcoin is the flatscreen mobile phone, when it could just as easily be a flip phone that's about to be eclipsed by a new blockchain cryptocurrency in the future.

People will continue to mine because they'll assume less people are mining, so as a result mining remains just as hard and people keep buying graphics cards because there's the feeling it'll just be around the corner.
Basically nothing bar an outright crash would affect mining in any way, and even then tons of people would continue to mine just in case it got better.

Is it really that surprising? Most of the time bitcoin's price is pretty stagnant, sure it might go up $10 or down $8 in a day but it's still roughly the same and isn't that interesting.
It's when it's going to huge highs and huge lows that people actually have something to discuss.

Are you seriously telling me that bitcoin is crash proof considering it has just halved in value in a month?

b-b-b-but Chinese holidays guys?
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:00:46
I mean it IS going up, but then down again worse the following day.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:59:02
Worse, it isn't even sarcasm. These people bought in with bitcoin on the rise and helped it reach its fabulous 19.5k, but yet these people are now vilified on the internet as scum?
It's pure spitefulness from people annoyed at the dip.

You realise that for small transactions you can use paypal for free transactions? There's no fee for transferring between friends and family because there's no need for payment insurance.
I regularly lend (and receive back) money to my sister whenever she's in a tight squeeze just before payday, and it has never failed me.

Tbh back then there was no bitcoin alternative with the same power as bitcoin, once Etherium overtakes Bitcoin's price things are going to be very interesting because the only thing that separates Bitcoin from its rivals is its name and strong price.

The big problem is that everyone is seeing previous years trends and assuming that that's how they'll go, except if it pans out in a slightly different way then people panic and it all falls into a deeper problem.
It's understandable it goes down after a huge boom, but I think talking about the Chinese holidays and how it's just a January slump might be the true reason people have been bailing out today, they expected it to start going up today.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:32:22
Nah I think this crash was down to everyone talking about a January slump that happens every year and that it usually picks up around the end of January/start of February.
Except it hasn't, so some people are getting a little scared of their investments and it's causing a bigger crash. Then you've got people who are just selling now so they can buy back cheaper in a week.
Altogether it results in a significant mess because everyone wants it to crash a little to exploit the market but everyone doing it at once is crashing it a little too hard and making it more unstable.

If you don't understand how bitcoin relates to GPUs rising through the mining of altcoins to be traded for bitcoins by now then I have no words for you.

How exactly was it weird? The 'January slump' lasted until the first week of February, whilst also losing 70% of it's value. It was a big drop and a long drop at the same time and caught a lot of people off guard.
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:41:09
Oh fuck off, you know exactly what I mean by bitcoin mining.
Nobody mines bitcoins but they mine altcoins to convert to bitcoins, but somehow people have to deflect that EVERY TIME bitcoin mining is mentioned.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:36:18
Honestly? I don't think it will.
I think there's a lot of people holding bitcoins who realise they messed up by not selling at 19k, so the second it nears 20k people will start selling again and inevitably cause another major drop.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:35:08
I mean if it's going down and you think it's going down further, why wouldn't you sell? You could just pick up more coins as it got cheaper and make more when it rises again.
