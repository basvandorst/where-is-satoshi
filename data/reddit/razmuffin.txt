I'm now worried I didn't explain enough. Bitcoin is a stagnant currency. There can never be any more than 21 million bitcoins in existence, and a currency that can't doesn't grow at the same rate as inflation can't operate properly. The United States has had many economic collapses due to being on the gold or silver standard. The reason Bitcoin is going up in value so much is because of its over-hype on the internet. I understand the desire for a de-nationalized, online currency, but in your best interest I would take some of the money you were fortunate enough to earn and put it in a savings account.
If you 100% disagree with everything I've said here, and If you want to invest some of this money back into bitcoin, I would have no issue, as this might be something you really believe in. But at least know that it's never a good idea to invest so much in such a volatile market. I don't know your current economic situation, but I would hope that you put some money away from this stroke of luck.
Thanks for your time,

If bitcoin is just a store of currency, like you say, doesn't that make its value 100% dependent on the currencies it is supposedly superior than? I may be misunderstanding  what you were trying to say, but that seems like a contradiction to me

Cause and effect. It had the greatest growth in that period because it was industrializing. It just happened to be on that standard.
If you are actually arguing that the gold standard is a viable way to run an economy, I have someone named "Every Economist In The World" who would like to disagree

pull at least half of your money out of bitcoin. It's a massive bubble, and will crash. You might not agree with me, but for you own sake, pull out at least a decent sum and invest it somewhere less volatile

Unfortunately I'm as well versed in these topics as I'd like to be, and I feel like if I tried to explain it I would mess something up and spread misinformation, so I'll direct you to some articles I've been reading.
And here is a good quote form this article that illustrates my point.
“Cryptocurrencies [like bitcoin] make it difficult to implement monetary adjustment mechanisms, which are required to ensure our economies run smoothly,” said Desjardins analysts in their report. “As an example, the central banks can temporarily lend liquidities to another financial institution in difficulty as a last resort. This mechanism allows a panic situation to be contained and prevents the domino effect from rippling through the financial system.”
Essentially im saying that a lack of regulation is bad, and that with a fixed sum of coins, the bitcoin economy would be too volatile to operate as a legitimate currency.

pretty much

If the value of bitcoin can be subdivided as necessary, then doesn't that require its value to be tied to the growth of current currencies, thus defeating the purpose?

Aren't there only a finite number of bitcoins in the world? This would mean the price is going to inflate to the point that it becomes absurdly overpriced, then when the max number of coins is reached, they will do nothing but deflate in value

yes thats's honestly what I was getting at. I'd much rather OP invest in something else. I was just worried he might get caught up in the Bitcoin hype and lose his investment in what I see as a bubble

Why is this new capitalist class somehow better than the old one exactly? All this is is a minor shift in wealth. In fact, for most people, a currency without a middleman to compensate for when they are either cheated or scammed out of money is a bad thing. Bitcoin is being treated as a way to make money through investment, not as a currency. All the "now accepting bitcoin" announcements are nothing but publicity stunts. I understand from a libertarian view the appeal of a decentralized currency, but regulation is what keeps currencies stable. I dont thing we have enough evidence that unregulated currencies work yet to accept this as a legitimate form of financial transaction.
