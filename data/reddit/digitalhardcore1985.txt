Have you forgotten the Mexicans are going to pay for that one ^^/s

Did you send it in BTC? I always use litecoin for small transactions.

I'm with you on paying taxes but for your average bloke who doesn't have an accountant making crypto-crypto trades a taxable event is a real pain in the arse.

I was banging on about them the other day, got me out of a stuck transaction but costs 5 USD.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:19:42
Thanks, so that tells me how many transactions are currently unconfirmed, mine would be in the purple band (267.38 sat/B). Is there anyway I can calculate an estimate as to how long it would take to confirm? Sorry bit clueless, am I at risk of the transfer being stuck in limbo forever or is it generally just a matter of waiting it out?
EDIT: I found [this]( which shows an estimated time of 45m / 5 blocks for my fee level (minimum going up to infinity). Really hope it's not infinity, that would really put a downer on my friday (and teach me a lesson).

It upsets me what they spend our tax money on as well but some of it goes to good use and seems like the best system we have come up with so far. From an ethical point of view it has to come down to a weighing of the options, without the taxes and the public services they provide the country would likely descend into absolute chaos which is why that system has never been successful anywhere in the world on a large scale. I'm in the UK and I suppose a massive amount of our tax goes on healthcare which the vast majority of the citizens agree with and would defend to the last breathe so we probably have a slightly better view of taxation than some other parts of the world. If we just paid for the services we personally consume and left the rest to philanthropy crime would be rampant with only the rich protected, the poor would go uneducated and many would die from preventable diseases / treatable accidents. How would your ethics cope then? What we have no isn't ideal but we have democracy, if you don't want your taxes spent on wars then we need to stop voting in warmongers and convince everyone else to do the same. Just cutting yourself out is going to end you up in jail which is no good for you or your family and isn't a long term solution for a better society.

I stupidly sent a couple of hundred USD between exchanges today with only 260sat/byte as that was what was recommended by mercatox. My own fault for thinking they might be offering sound advice, realise now I'm fucked and have been waiting 4 hours for one confirmation.
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:59:23
I'm not sure but I've heard it will be both strong and stable.

The US trade deal will fuck us harder than we've ever been fucked before. We'll swap a great deal with our closest neighbours for one in which we accept lower standards and likely open up our beloved public services to greater competition. We elect MEPs to that centralised government and we have a real say in the laws and standards we have to trade by. That won't be the case once we have to go begging for a class a shafting from Trump and co.

Yeah and when you do transfer it it'll cost you $15 in fees :)

* First they came for single mums and I said nothing because I wasn't a single mum.
* Then they came for the disabled and I said nothing as I wasn't disabled.
* Then they came for social care and I said nothing as I wasn't old.
* Then they came for the NHS and I said nothing as I wasn't sick.
* Then they came for crypto and I said you can shove it up your shitpipe you fucking bellend.

use a transaction accelerator if it's worth 5 bucks to you. I was sceptical but it actually worked.

My mum told me to sell at $10 and I did. In fairness to my mum, I'd have probably sold shortly after that anyway as the wisdom of hodl would take years to sink in.

The Home Secretary was happy to extradite Richard over a copyright offence (when all his site did was contain links). This only fell apart because the public overwhelmingly backed Richard and it made the MPAA look like the total arseholes we all know they are.

They're not all psychopaths. I work in a technical team where you couldn't really operate just to benefit yourself and still survive and most of the people could probably make more money doing an easier job elsewhere in the company. People I work with are genuinely nice and go out of their way to explain and help you with stuff. Just saying not everyone's a bastard out for themselves even though it seems that way sometimes. 
There's definitely psychopaths though, our society rewards them for being ruthless. They're prepared to make the decisions others consider immoral or are uncomfortable with, they'll never accept blame for anything, they make grandiose promises about what they can achieve without the slightest consideration for those that have to make it happen rather than bullshit about it to higher ups. Most companies are short sighted and these people look like great performers - their own greed perfectly aligns with the goals of the company to make more money. If the shit does look like it's going to hit the fan they just move on somewhere else.
Don't get me wrong, I'd quit in an instant if I won the crypto lottery. No doubt about that but not because everyone's a psychopath but mostly because it's the psychopaths within your average business who get to dictate the rules and make everyone else miserable. There's more ways to contribute to society though than taking a salary, I mean how many jobs are just bullshit anyway? Half of our jobs are just concerned with sorting out who owns what, who owes what to who etc. etc. 
I'd get bored doing (my version) of your list after a while, it'd be great at first but then you need some sort of purpose in life to feel useful. I reckon after a year of fucking around I'd head back to university and try find a way to contribute which doesn't involve having to take a pay cheque from a bunch of psychopaths.

Isn't privacy out the window at this point anyway, I thought blockchain analysis had pretty much rendered the change addresses useless which is why they weren't implemented in Ethereum? I'm happy to be told otherwise, I just thought that was the case.

Do you mind explaining the difference?

Cadbury chocolate and the absolute fuck tonne of choice we get in the chocolate bar department has to be one of the best things about living in the UK that you don't appreciate until you go elsewhere and find it's pretty much milka, kinder or nowt (not knocking those brands though). Agreed this was a great ad, along with GTA it taught me to appreciate the greatness that is phil collins.

Yeah I'm well aware of that but there are few cheaper options in the UK for getting your money onto an exchange other than buying through coinbase or localbitcoins first. My mother purchased her monero on kraken in exchange for bitcoin purchased at coinbase.

Got one of these emails the other day.

Yeah, I'd just got my first job out of university, didn't have a lot of money and I was happy with my small profit at the time. It was only 10 BTC but that's still a lot of money to me, if I'd held onto it now I could have paid off my credit card, put down a deposit for a house and bought a second hand car. Nevermind though, you live and learn - I'm building up a portfolio of different cryptos and hodl is the name of the game.

Will do cheers.

Just to put it in perspective, both my parents have now invested small amounts in crypto. My dad opened his coinbase account last week and my mum the week before. They're holding Ethereum, Litecoin and Monero. Both are in their 50s and have no real previous interest in crypto, they're not really techies but it seems to be going mainstream and they're hearing about it everywhere.

I bought in at $5 and sold at $10, sometimes I think I should just go up into the attic and blow my brains out.

Although I don't have recent figures a few years back 58% of the country lived on less than 3.10 USD a day. There is a middle class who can afford to trade bitcoin but most wouldn't have the spare money to do so.

If it was millions, you could just take some of it, not saying I would but if I was going to, I'd make sure my friend had enough to have a nice life too. See, I'm nice like that.
