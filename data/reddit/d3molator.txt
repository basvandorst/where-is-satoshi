Why not hold Bitcoin Gold? (serious question)
@_date: 2017-08-18 07:17:08
Cool, Thanks a lot man.
So I don't get it, what exactly is the difference from Bitpay and Electrum wallet? If any hard forking happens or some other shit, will I still have my coins?

Thanks a lot man. Greatly appreciate it.

So I have exported my Bitapay MultiSig wallet and imported into Electrum. Can I say, that I am safe now if Bitpay do something shady? (Segwit/2x all these things)
BTW, Do I have to delete my Bitpay wallet?

So, is it safe to keep my coins in Electrum wallet, until everything is over?
By the way, Electrum gave me 12 word seed, does this mean, If my PC got stolen, or failed, I can type in the 12 word seeds, and get my coins back?

I don't think there is such a thing as 'Best Wallet'. Instead you should try different wallets with very low amount of Bitcoin and see which one you like best. 
Though I personally use Copay (Bitpay wallet), and it's pretty good, it supports Android, Windows (for other OS check the website), supports Multi-Sig, beautiful interface, great integration with Bitpay (duh), easy to receive and send, not complicated and cluttered interface. There is only 1 thing, I hate about this wallet, and that's the new version for Windows, don't know why they've changed it, but they made it buggy and sometimes it just doesn't seem to work! Anyway I just hope they fix the windows version. I haven't found a better wallet than Copay. 
Good luck.

So what wallet do we have to choose?
This Hard forking thing is really frustrating ...
@_date: 2017-08-18 07:55:55
I have the exact same question, and unfortunately there is still no good answer which can also be helpful :( .
I only exported my private keys from BitPay to My Electrum wallet. Let's see what will happen. 
It would be great if anyone find any solution, share it.

I paid ~1$ Fee and it got confirmed after about 22 hours! WTF!

Looks Great. ��

Wooooow, that looks awesome man.

What about Copay/Bitpay wallets? Should we withdraw too? 
I think in Copay/Bitpay wallet we own the private keys, don't we?

I have the exact same questions.
And why the fuck the down votes? This post is very useful!
