I share this sentiment.  Her public cya stinks of  fear of personal financial loss.  It undermines what she claims she's trying to protect.  Poorly thought out reactionary response.

Some analysts I've come to trust are convinced jihan and roger are going to take advantage of this downturn to cripple btc mining to drive money into bch during the upswing.  My bias makes me not agree with this assessment, but it's an interesting theory to watch for.

What a long-winded approach at selling bcash.  Really tipped their hand in the footnotes.  
@_date: 2018-01-24 05:16:19
Honestly, like most people I've heard, talked to, and listened to that are deeply entrenched in traditional finance, they understand finance, but have a weak understanding of technology.  Bitcoin, crypto in general, is such a quickly emerging merger of finance and technology, that older people simply cannot grasp what it is, what it means, and where it's going.  These gentlemen are no exception.  
They approach the topic with a clear lack of fundamental understanding of the underlying change this brings globally.  It's easy to see that if these guys even own smartphones, they have no idea how to download an app, and if presented with a crypto wallet, would be completely hopeless.   As with the majority of their generation, they simply fear what they do not understand.  Zero value here.

That's what a lot of "smart money" did.  IMO, if you didn't do it a couple days ago, you've missed that train and it makes better financial sense to just hold and wait out the storm.  Though, really, it comes down to whether you believe it'll continue down into 4 digits, I constantlyl hear anything from 5-8k possible, or whether it'll eventually bounce off 10k range.  Also matters whether you're a "true-believer" or just in it for the "technology".

His observations regarding block size were fine, there is still plenty of room for academic debate regarding it, but when he mentioned in his footnote:


I mean...come on...how much more obvious can it get.  Hence my term "long-winded".  That's just the bcash argument using bigger words.

This whole push for Gemini is starting to reek of a calculated effort.  Have you bothered to read the rules of the NYSE?  Obviously not.  You're all idiots if you think Coinbase deserves to be singled out as some sort of evil monster just because they trade a coin you don't agree with.  This subreddit, for YEARS, has bitched about all the exchanges at one point or another.  I've seen plenty of complaints leveled at Gemini, Bitfinex, Kraken, Coinbase, all of them.  Just stop the FUD, all you do is FUD the entire marketplace.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:53:34
Bullshit.  The issue is the FUD inherent in your statement that "the manipulation may continue..."  Don't try to sidestep the reality that you clearly have no idea what you are talking about, and worse, are attempting to use information that has nothing to do with the FUD you are trying to spread.  Make up your mind.  Are you complaining about the lack of Segwit?  Most exchanges don't support it.  All exchanges, in all markets, have some level of manipulation happening.  Just because one exchange experiences a momentary stumble while introducing a new trading pair doesn't suddenly make them either inept or evil.  Here's some new information for you, trading carries risk.

Deserving of our support.  Really?  Why?  In the same way Bill Gates deserves support so I should buy Microsoft?  How about people make financial decisions not based on temporary emotions.  What happens when the "twins" do something you don't like, and I've got 50k in their system, should I just pull it out based on how you feel about them?
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:24:15
I think you wildly underestimate just how many people here are living something close to paycheck to paycheck.  You have your opinion, and are free to express it.  You are also comfortably well off, and can afford to play with your crypto without it affecting your short or long term financial situation.  My opinion is that you are not as smart as you think you are.  When bitcoin hits 40k, 50k, or 100k, come back here and tell us just how smart you were to take your gains now.

You can't predict the future, but investing, by its very definition, is the act of trying to predict the future.  You don't buy stock in Apple because they make a cool phone, you buy stock in Apple because you believe their next phone will also sell well, and hopefully better than their last one.
The same holds true for crypto.  You can convert real dollars into cryptocurrency in order to use that currency.  Thats not investing, it's just a currency exchange.  If you are buying a cryptocurrency as an investment, you are buying into it's future potential.  Your primary question remains, is bitcoin the best cryptocurrency for the future.  My answer, again, is nobody can really answer that with any measure of accuracy.  It's like asking if Apple's next iPhone will sell well.  Based on past performance, the next iPhone is likely to sell well, just as, based on past performance, bitcoin is likely to increase in value.  Beyond that, especially considering the long-term volatility of all technology products and markets, everything else is just speculation.  Your question does not have an answer, it has many answers, depending on what you want to hear.

I just want to go on the record that if I wake up tomorrow morning and 100btc mysteriously appears in my wallet, it will be used for cocaine, hookers, and bottle service.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:05:35
No.  The entire point in investing in technology products is based on what their future holds.  Their current value is already priced into their stock/coin value.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:31:32
Not really.  You are underestimating the value of brand, however.  Branding, infrastructure, marketcap, and adoption have given bitcoin time to make upgrades and adjustments.  Will those changes work out?  Nobody knows.  Everyone in this space is speculating.  At this moment in time you have as much likelyhood at buying a lambo with your earnings by betting everything on Bitcoin or Raiblocks.
You are basically asking us in 1998 whether you should sell Yahoo to buy Google.  Google is Google now not just because of their search algorithm, but because they also made many very good decisions over the years, and Yahoo made many poor decisions, to get to where they both stand today.  Yahoo is still here, and worth billions.  It's just not today's Google.  There was a time when Google was the upstart, but nobody could have predicted it would be where it is now.  Yahoo is still here, and worth billions, primarily because of brand recognition, not because they have introduced anything new in the last 20 years. 
What you are missing is the inability to predict the future.

One is refusing to paint "Congratulations" on a rainbow colored cake, the other is refusing to provide financial transactions for someone who knowingly traffics in lies, conspiracy theories, and harassment.  Any support for him is to condone his treatment of the Sandy Hook parents, just as the baker believes that painting on that cake condones two men fornicating.  So, you are right.  They are different.  I may not agree with the baker, but his decision is based on a profound and honest belief in his religion.  Alex Jones' behavior is solely based, self-admittedly in a court of law, on greed.  He has no deep convictions.  He does what he does for the entertainment value of it, not because he thinks it is moving our country in any particular direction.  To support him is to support lying for profit, manipulation for money.   It is not free speech to trick people out of money.  Alex Jones is a con artist at the pinnacle of his career.  It's all downhill from here.

No, this is private businesses choosing who they do business with.  I believe the Supreme Court just made a ruling about this that the alt-right was quite happy about.  Too bad you can't cherry pick when you get to force someone into a business relationship, i guess?

You can convert btc for usd at any time on coinbase.  You simply cannot withdraw more than 10k usd per week.  If you really have 30k plus in an exchange, and do not understand their rules, you have no business being in that market.  Read the fucking manual.  A fool and his money are easily parted.

Assange wanted to play with the big dogs.  He squarely positioned himself to one side of a partisan politics yard.  If he didn't want to get bit, he should have retained some semblance of neutrality and released information damaging to both sides.  His credibility as a neutral arbiter of information has bled out.  Let him sit in the pound for a while.

The same people that will probably be hit with hefty fines or jail time for not accurately paying their taxes or selling financial instruments without a licence.

I've always found it important to understand that great men, that do great things, also do so at great personal cost.  His first wife, Justine, has  written some interesting things on the subject of billionaires and her ex-husband, and in a way that doesn't come across as unduely biased against her ex, but more as a fly-on-the-wall to the day-to-day of being, and living among, Elon and those like him.  It gives some much needed perspective as we hoist these people onto their gilded pedestals.  Not saying Elon is not a great person, just saying that it's also important to remember the human.

This is a really good use-case challenge.  What can the crypto-dev community create that will make it easy enough for Peterson fans to transfer fiat to crypto then transfer crypto to Peterson?  My parents and older friends simply cannot grasp how wallets and transfers work.  How in the world does anyone think Peterson fans can figure it out?  Talk about making crypto dummy-proof.

They say that money can't buy you happiness, but that it can buy you options.  There are not many options in the Caribbean.

The TA guys love to point out their "big green dildos" on twitter when something moons, and talk about how they "called it".  You'll never, once, ever see them admit when they made a bad call.  Ever.  It's the same with stock day-trading.  Same people, same attitude.  There's always 1 guy that makes big bucks, and a thousand that go belly up.  TA is a trading tool, and trading is blackjack.  I made 100x more investing in crypto than I ever did trading crypto.
