There is a ton of support under 9k. I've been expecting a dip with buys set at 8900 for a month now.

Or just get slammed for AML and the bank gets tied to money laundering.

More than likely a Ponzi scheme

apparently this has hit a few companies in my industry and shut down production. Could end up being larger than expected. 
Bad news: bad publicity.
Good new: its still publicity.

shit I had 400+ Eth at the time of his big snatch. Ill give someone 100 if they could get it back for me. Already in the class action, but doubt that will come of anything.

wow, im still waiting on a formal response from them after 4 tickets opened. I bought when it was ~$500/btc a few months ago got canceled the last day of the waiting period when the price had been about $800/btc, my second purchase i made was at ~$780/btc and it went through after the price dipped to $700/btc a few days later. 
I have continued to use them because they are the best service. I am unhappy with the potential gains I could have had and their customer service but I appreciate their service and function in the bitcoin community.

i have been having the same problem, hope it gets corrected as I contacted them yesterday. Im just trying to learn, first hand, how to use it for transactions. investment is nice, Im sure ill dump more money in, but I want to use it as a currency and actually give the system value. frustrating to see the back log, but that just means the system is getting attention and thats a good thing. Ive got faith in Coinbase, I just have to wait....its hard to wait.

What really should be done is use the BTC for purchasing goods, as it was intended. However, for investment purposes, when investing in a product you have faith in for the long haul you buy hold and accumulate. but trading on ups and downs can make you great money too.

That is true, the more people involved will keep the exchange rate more steady.
I think that the dependence on thinking of BTC valued in a dollar/pound/etc will have to end in order for it to truly be used as currency because of the reasons you mentioned; BTC has to stand on its own to see what its value really is.  
Although, with a deflating currency how does one value goods consistently? Fiat you can print more money to keep prices artificially low, corrrect? what happens when bitcoin mining peaks and there is a constant increase in the number of people using?
