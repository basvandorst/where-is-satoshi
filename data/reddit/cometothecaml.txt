Last time I checked, bitcoin isn't going to zero

1. Try sending 10 thousand dollars to Russia, see how much you'll pay in fees. The government might not even let you do that.
2. Cold storage exists. Get a Ledger Nano
3. The crisis was caused by too much debt
4. Just because people lend money doesn't make it a monopoly. You can go to many different banks today, compare rates, and choose the one with the lowest interest rates.
5. &amp;
6. Don't see how that invalidates the point that bitcoin is open 24/7
7. You can send money to places where banks don't exist or aren't as widespread as in the US
8. No fees better than fees
9. North Korea counterfeits US dollars and they've gotten past the scanners. Search up supernotes
10. I don't like the idea of politicians and bankers being in control of my money.

Exchanges get hacked, it's better to store your bitcoins yourselves

I asked for my balance and bot replied instantly.
Don't know what's wrong.
@_date: 2019-11-01 01:30:07
wow thanks

Looks like someone took it a few days ago.

using a DEX (decentralized exchange) like bisq, waves, (theres probably more but I can't think of any off the top of my head)
trading between cryptos is easier than trading fiat to crypto.
@_date: 2019-11-01 01:21:58
you can convert btc to monero, then send it and convert it back to btc so people can't track it.
@_date: 2019-11-01 01:19:30
Avoid alts.
Most of them are down a lot (90%) and are never going back to their ATHs. You might get lucky and catch a few winners but you're going to lose in the long run.
Also avoid leverage. 
Source: Watched people lose thousands on message boards after buying the latest shilled alt or shorting btc at $7.6k.

I don't know but I heard that you dont need kyc if you're withdrawing less than 2BTC

received, thanks

looks like the bot's down again
@_date: 2019-11-01 01:41:22
Message me if you get double charged. I'll give it back.
@_date: 2019-11-01 01:52:25
wow it's back

I guess that might work but what if the server with your keys goes down? How long will you have to wait for the timelock to expire?

Check your wallet. If it's completed, you should see bitcoin in your wallet. If it doesn't have bitcoin, you have malware that replaces the stuff in your clipboard. 
Normally, wallets produce another crypto address when you receive btc for privacy reasons.

Get the Reddit Scammer Labeler extension. Granted, it's not 100% accurate and it won't catch new scammers but in this case, the guy was listed as a scammer for over half a year.
Alternatively, you can do a search on reddit for his username, and you'll see that he scammed someone a few months ago.
Do some basic checks before you send money.

Watch out, most crypto mining contracts / cloud mining services are scams.
@_date: 2019-12-12 05:39:54
You should keep your keys yourself. Don't trust others with it.

Don't borrow money to put it into bitcoin. If you can't take a 90% loss, don't invest.
@_date: 2019-12-29 01:27:39
Just cryogenically preserve yourself like Hal Finney
(or setup a time lock system where every year you check in. if you don't check in, it emails the private key to people in your will)
@_date: 2019-12-19 04:14:12
Not exactly.
Most exchanges allow you to reset your password with your phone number. If you didn't give them your phone number, the attacker would have to guess your password to get your funds.

You can't prove encryption is safe and can't be broken. No one knows if there's a fast way to reverse SHA-256, but it's been 20 years and no one has been able to break it.
@_date: 2019-12-15 03:25:34
In general, if anyone gives you x btc on a sketchy site that requires y btc to withdraw, do not send the difference because they will almost surely steal it.
@_date: 2019-12-25 06:52:41
You're right. I meant to say that you can't prove \[insert cryptographic algorithm\] is secure in general (unless it's one time pad).

He can just tumble his coins

Look at dollar cost averaging
(also an unknown pool right now has \~70% of the BCH hash rate, BCH is vulnerable to getting 51% attacked so I would suggest that you don't invest in it. Also, Roger Ver promoted HEX, which is a scam)
@_date: 2019-12-25 06:56:20
Cool, you can add mod 2
@_date: 2019-12-10 03:09:45
1. Download a bitcoin wallet (like Mycelium)
2. Wait until January 3rd (Proof of Keys day) or not
3. Withdraw your BTC to your wallet.
Congratulations! You now have real BTC with no fractional reserve bullshit!

Here's the news article
@_date: 2019-09-18 00:56:58
You could charge 10% more if they're paying with fiat. Might get people without btc interested.
@_date: 2019-09-02 16:44:24
you can calculate the 1st hash for 'aaaaaa', 'aaaaab', 'aaaaac', and so on in parallel. Then you can calculate the second hash in parallel too, then the third, and so on. I think I forgot that calculating the public key from the private key will take a significant amount of time, but this should still be doable with a relatively fast ASIC.
@_date: 2019-09-01 18:52:05
Seems doable.The best way to crack this would be to try all 26\^6 combinations. 26\^6 is quite big (around  308915776). You would have to do 9\^9 hashes in the worst case scenario (387420489) The total number of hashes in worst case scenario is  1.196803e+17. You can probably cut the time by using some fancy ASIC (you can give one of the parallel processes 'aaaaaa', one 'aaaaab', one 'aaaaac', and so on). Standard ASICs can hash at 1TH/s at least, so doing all 1x10\^17 hashes should take just over a day. Good miners can hash at 10TH/s, reducing time to a few hours. Of course, I don't have an ASIC so I can't try this, but this should be crackable in 3 months.
@_date: 2019-09-06 20:50:25
Take the money and run.
@_date: 2019-09-01 18:54:13
If you don't have an ASIC might as well hope the exponents are really small (like 9\^6 is a few orders of magnitude below 9\^9 because exponential functions grow fast). OP should probably choose a different function because some guy might think 5\^5 is secure, or put a lower bound on hashes.
@_date: 2019-09-04 00:45:42
Go to [rek.to]( one of the entries is you getting liquidated.
@_date: 2019-09-18 21:06:05
Its actually 36\^4, \^5, \^6, \^7. Much more manageable numbers.

It's the inverse bart simpson.

This isn't enough evidence to say the dice aren't fair. Using Chi-Square test we can see that there's a 38.89% chance of getting a result as extreme or more than this. You would need a 5% chance to have sufficient evidence.
