Why doesn't that "road map" have any dates on it? I wouldn't call this a road map at all

Ah ok, thanks for the info, guess I’ll have to start small and setup some kind of donation system to grow it. There might easily be enough people who want to help support Bitcoin nut don’t have the technical knowhow to do so

Wouldn’t you need a lot more processing power for a proper node? The servers I’m looking at to rent cost at least $150 a month because of the processing power requirements

Cool, I’ll check it out later today

Oh, I thought Electrum was a different coin, or do you mean the transactions between Electrum and Bitcoin? Instead of Electrum and USD
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:51:03
Thanks for the info, I’m not sure about how viable asking for donations will be but I’ll check out ElectrumX and portably Etherium as well, maybe once those start making ok money I’ll be able to startup a Bitcoin node as well

Then why did you post this in the first place?
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:06:44
Thanks :)

What’s going on with Bitfinex?
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:05:55
Cool! That's a useful link :), I do still have to figure out how to cash out my 0.005 ETH I mined about 2 months back Xd (I still have the files on my computer but the program I was using wouldn't download the Etherium block chain in order to verify it :/ )

I knew it! I knew I saw that image before!

Oh wauw.. That's quite a shady practice.. I might just ask a co-worker first if I can borrow his for a short week (he's got a couple miners at home that he says he doesn't use anymore)

LPT: don’t talk about Bitcoin with people who aren’t interested 
I let some of my friends and my parents in on me investing in Bitcoin but I won’t tell them how, where or why, if they want that information all they have to do is ask

Could you maybe point me to a proper tutorial on how to setup GPU mining? My previous setup was quite janky (no wonder why I haven't received my ETH yet :P) and I had (and still have) no real idea on how to do it properly. According to this site:  My GTX 1080 could still turn a profit (though I don't think it calculates in the rest of the hardware in my PC so it could be a bit less)
The WhatToMine.com site doesn't list BTC directly, with ETH it would be profitable as well though :)

Bought at €5300 last sunday, already earned back the transaction costs at Coinbase ^^

Honestly, I was expecting him to just take a bunch of nuts (as in the regular kind) and only eat the left one... Why the fuck did you eat your actual left testicle nut 0_o........

Plus you need to order at least 5 machines, you can't just order 1 :/
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:21:19
Awesome, I'll check it out, thanks :)
Oh and I just initiated the transaction to send the 0.05 Eth to my Coinbase wallet, I can already see it in there but it's awaiting confirmation :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:25:40
Can’t :/, I don’t have two identification documents so I can’t use GDAX yet (and I’m not gonna get a second one because I’m quite close to getting my drivers license)

For the T16 I'd be making a profit according to this website: 
Until how much can I trust those numbers? (I pulled the wattage and Hashing power from the video currently on @_date: 2017-11-22 19:26:31
Hmm, what's the issue with BitMain then? I don't know them and afaik they're the only ASIC suppliers
Wait.. I mined 0.05 ETH, it was about $10 at the time and the price went up since then, better get on to cashing that out into a proper wallet
