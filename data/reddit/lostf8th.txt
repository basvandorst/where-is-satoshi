You said it best yourself, only you have it wrong. Value is how the world projects its price. 
Backwards is all, I forgive you.

This is beautiful.

It's not a price. So zero. You dont say the price of a pound or the price of yen. They are values. So bitcoin has a value of xxxusd.

New technology is the future. New technology is an investment. I sold all my holdings but plan on regaining my positions. I bought designer snakes, with Hope's that one day their babies will make me money. In doing so I didnt have to go through a bank, and that to me is worth more than its face value. Resist! Take the power back! Be that snake in their boot!

We cant tell you what to do with your money. If I were in your shoes, I'd consider doing both. Spread your chances. So consider 1 coin then DCA from there.
