For the last few days I was of the opinion that a large group were running a blatant campaign to discredit gox. After yesterdays "announcement" there is no doubt in my mind that Karpeles knows exactly what he is doing and is operating in cahoots with them. The question is, what are we going to do about it?

Nope, I want what is good for me. That's the sad thing about incentives, what's good for one person isn't necessarily good for everyone.
