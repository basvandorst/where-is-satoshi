And you pay fees in whole bitcoins too?

My website is in beta (speedmtg.com) as long as you don't mind the 0.1 BTC upper limit for deposits.

I used to be 90% magic the gathering, 10% coins but after november I'm 90% coins and 10% magic the gathering.

Mt Gox was a Magic: The Gathering *ONLINE* Exchange, which is an exchange for digital assets on the MTGO client. SpeedMTG only deals with real collectable cards.

Because WoW doesn't let addons talk to the outside world, this is no different than people sharing paypal addresses with other players (when it comes to payment for in game things). A positive difference is that I can whip out my android and scan right in game without having to awkwardly tab in and out trying to copy each letter from the address one by one, then hoping it's correct.

When people try to share addresses in game, there is often the anxiety of trying to copy exactly what is written down, or having to go to bit.ly's, or awkwardly work around the game to get addresses from person A to person B. This addon removes the stress of exactness and speeds up the process to essentially instant. The next feature I hope I can get out is also fully functioning bitcoin private key creation with a fully functioning bitcoin public key. I want adopting bitcoin to be extremely easy and integrated in to a game where potential adopters spend tons of their time.

That's pretty awesome, I'll have to set that up.
@_date: 2014-02-19 04:04:55
It's also free, open source, and not attached to any company. It's simply a tool for increasing bitcoin adoption by letting a large demographic have convenient ways to share addresses without having to send people to bit.ly's or the like.

If you ctrl-f to find WoWCoins.zip you'll see a blue hyperlink that leads to a download. I checked when not logged in and was still able to download. I also was notified of 2 errors people were getting and fixed them:

Bitcoin makes sharing wealth (including in small amounts) simple, fast, and easy. If something becomes more convenient for everyone, it will become more convenient for criminals. It is unavoidable but the good outweighs the bad.

You know, that's definitely correct. But what about it makes it so good for new users?

What a coincidence, I did a 5 minute presentation at the Edmonton Bitcoin Meetup on video games and cryptocurrency. If anyone wants, the slides are up at  but the video isn't up yet.

For new users, I would start by showing off the Bitcoin apps on phones. Everyone has a smartphone and I have Bitcoin loaded on mine. I would ask the CFO to download a wallet, then transfer $10 worth to him, and when it appears instantly it should be an impressive show of convenience for anyone who hasn't heard of Bitcoin before.
For desktops, I would start with Exchanges. I would run through the Coinbase setup process which I won't detail here since we all know it but it is the most consumer friendly (especially for someone who hasn't heard of Bitcoin before).
To expand past that, I would show off Bitcoin Core. Creating a public address, storing the private key somewhere else or on paper, sending a transaction to the desktop wallet, and spending that afterwards. For private keys, they are similar to 'passwords' for a public key (address). Anyone with that 'password' can spend the money in that account. This is enough knowledge to get a new user through buying and storing Bitcoin for the first time.

Wow, great questions!


Blockchain technology provides veritable, decentralised proof. This can be used for anything you use a traditional ledger for. Blockchain technology is so secure that Bitcoin uses the blockchain to record records of value, with many multi-million dollar transactions occurring securely. Recording a transaction, record of sale, or employee information of any kind is secure and unalterable inside a blockchain.


This is why I posted on Reddit, I need help with this one. What actually are the pitfalls?


Bitcoin is a technology that can facilitate payments. For all the stores that you can put Bitcoin payment acceptance into, there are many ways to look at adoption. First would be simply educating the thousands of stores on how simple it is to put up a QR code managed by a payment company (such as coinbase) that immediately turns bitcoins in to cash in your account. I would personally recommend keeping the bitcoins, but there are ways to sell them instantly if you prefer. Second would be creating a second coin, a "CityCoin" that is backed or hedged by Bitcoin. One main disconnect between Bitcoin and Visa is the speed of transactions. Bitcoin creates blocks every 10 minutes. Other coins like Litecoin are around a couple minutes. This means transactions are verified faster, and a new CityCoin could be similar to visa with blocks every 30 seconds, which would very quickly facilitate payment processing. Third would be Bitcoin as an investment instead of as a payment processing tool. By creating utility in the coin within the City, perhaps by allowing certain public things to be traded or purchased with Bitcoin, it will increase adoption dramatically. Many people have heard of Bitcoin but it has never been a part of their lives, a public utilization of Bitcoin would bring it to the forefront of people's attention.

Well, how should I explain the utility of Bitcoin instead of the investment aspect of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:42:59
That's why I put it in quotes. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:54:25
I'm also guessing the first question would be along the lines of "What is Bitcoin"?
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies are currencies that do not exist in $20 bills or ounces of gold. They exist as accounts, just like bank accounts. And just like bank accounts, you can deposit to that account or spend from that account. Bitcoin is not created by a mint. Instead, the millions of people who verify transactions are all competing in a lottery style system. Everyone must verify transactions correctly in order to qualify for the 12.5 BTC reward at the end of every 10 minutes. Then the winner is chosen, everyone agrees that they now own the new 12.5 BTC.

It's supposed to be distilled down to simple terms as the CFO hasn't dealt with anything like this ever. I also am making some assumptions about their level of technological competency as they still mostly use faxes for communication, and specifically said to boil it down to simpler terms.
