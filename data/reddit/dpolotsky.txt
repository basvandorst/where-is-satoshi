The state is entirely up to you, as long as the regulations are followed. I'm not sure what you're implying--if it takes too long to buy bitcoin in the Texas desert, then that means our industry still has a lot more room for growth

In order to accept cash, there are certain extra expenses such as cash transportation, machine maintenance, and rent. While 3.5% may not be the best rate out there, it's way better than waiting 5-7 weeks to register with Coinbase, and then waiting another 5-7 days to withdraw btc. Think about going to a currency exchange in a different country---the upcharge is often over 10%, and most of our competitors are charging over that percentage as well.
The upfront cost of our token is 100 dollars to achieve this discount. This will likely pay for itself before the banking takeover you've described. There are also other incentives the token offers.
We want to make crypto as accessible as possible to the average person. Feel free to message me, I'd be glad to brainstorm with you.

Interesting take ��. Is someone mad they’ve been outed as a negative Nancy

We can!

I think Texas would be a brilliant place to begin operating. The regulators and laws are incredibly friendly there, and cost of operating/taxes are definitely lower than in Chicago

I like how tall the mountain is because it represents all the hurdles of the adoption of a new tech

But surely the fact that JPM has the capacity to trade bitcoin-related instruments in the first place is a reason for the CEO not to take shots at it!?

I'm wondering what will happen when all of China's neighbors (even N. Korea!) fully embrace the currency
@_date: 2017-09-20 07:31:38
But he said he would fire any trader trading it..since JPM doesn't prop trade, doesn't that mean he was referring to any trader that offered it to his clients?
