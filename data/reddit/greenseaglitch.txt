As a liberal, I believe everyone should have a right of Stalin.

If he can come up with that elsewhere, why can't he fund his bitcoin extravaganza with that "elsewhere" instead of motherfucking student loans?

No, he never implied that.

Sure but in your scenario owner financing makes exactly zero sense. If your house is worth $100k, why not just sell for $100k right away? Rather than get that $100k over time.

This makes a whole lot of sense \s
If the value of a house is $100,000 in bitcoin, why would sellers agree to accept monthly payments over time? Why not just sell for $100,000 in bitcoin right away?

Beware of anyone "helping" you over PM. Don't send anyone any files, because you could be sending your wallet file with all your bitcoins, and they can take all of the bitcoins out in an instant.

Lol this guy definitely won't steal all your bitcoins.

Cool so let's see if the math checks out. The current fiat price of a bitcoin is $239. A 7% daily increase in the fiat price of a bitcoin can be calculated as such:  
239 * (1 + 0.07)^(365*3)  
Result:  
$35779516396305200000000000000000000 per bitcoin  
Conclusion:  
OP is dumbfuck.
