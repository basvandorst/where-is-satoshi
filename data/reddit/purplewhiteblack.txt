I still say if you divide by Nothing, that means you never divided, and thus the answer is the original number. 3 / 0 = 3 = 3 * 1
This is, for the same reason Multiplying by one is the original number or dividing by 1 is the original number. Though, You can't really multiply by 1 or 0. It's really a semantical thing based more on consensus than logic. I either have none of something, one of something, or multiples of something. 
If you multiply something one time you should have at least 2. If you Divide something one time you should have at least 2 halves.  I don't think we do division, what we really do is polyvision.
If I want to divide a community into groups, I can either not divide them, divide them one time, or divide them multiple times.
But you know even though what I say is perfectly logical, I don't think anyone would back me up.

No, I have taken lots of math classes. 
The entire Math community sees this as dogmatic. You didn't read the whole part that this is a semantical argument.
"It's really a semantical thing based more on consensus than logic."
Have you heard of Non-Euclidean Geometry? Well, This is unorthodox math. I know how regular math works. This is math working by different rules. They follow a logic. It is abnormal, it is nonstandard, but it is valid if you are consistent. The regular rules are just as valid if you remain consistent. An alien civilization for example might not culturally use PEMDAS. As long as there is consistency their calculations can be made. It's the difference between a Pirate Ghost and a Ghost Pirate.
Imagine I have King. This king asks me to do three math operations. 
The first operation regards a task with monkeys. There are five monkeys and he has ordered me kill one and count the number of monkeys left.  I stab a monkey and now there are 4.
The next task. I am supposed to count the number of grapes left. The priests ate all of the grapes. There are no grapes left.
Now I am told that I must take the number of grapes left and cut each monkey into as many pieces as there are grapes left. I am given a giant scimitar that can cleanly divide a monkey with a slice. There are no grapes left. The monkeys will be spared. I cannot cut the monkeys into 0 pieces. Or alternatively If I were to take each monkey and apply 0 slashes then each monkey would remain whole. So, there are 4 monkeys remaining.
The monkeys are still deep fried whole, and served to guests. Though the guests don't get any grapes to eat with their deep fried monkeys. If there had been 1000 grapes then the monkeys would have been cut into pieces of 0.004 size and served on a skewer containing one grape and one monkey piece.
So instead of a calculator returning Undefined, or the software crashing the Calculator returns the original number instead, and software doesn't crash or return an error.
I'm a programmer. You don't know how many times I've had programs return 0 and then use that 0 in another equation and the program crash. Often times because of this I have to write in code so it doesn't return a 0. That means because of this the programmers have to write fixes to go around this. 
Though a fix is as simple If (g == 0) {g = 1}; 
There are other fixes like If (g == null) {return}; (This is  probably a better practice for reasons)
The results are the same. Either the original value is returned, or nothing is done and the variable remains at the original value.
By applying this non standard logic, the program does not crash.
By going with the standard logic and applying a fix, the program does not crash.
I'm not saying anyone in the world should follow this method. There is already a standardized way of doing things. There are good reasons why the standard version is in place(certain tasks would be weird, and more annoying otherwise). Operating in the standard way is more a matter of practicality. You really wouldn't want to follow through with the other way. Maintaining consistency would be weird in ways I don't want to get into. It is only useful in this one case. Practicality is the same reason why as soon as people could they dropped Roman style math. I just ask people to try to think outside their box.

We were dividing by 0, not 2. Still...
if you divide 4 monkeys in half it is still possible to just have 2 sets of monkeys just separated by space. They're still alive. Doing the math the regular way is quite mean. Finding the answer depends on which axis you cut the monkeys on. If you divide the monkeys horizontally then you have eight 1/2 size monkey pieces. If you divide them vertically then you have 4 living monkeys. That is unless the monkeys are all standing on each other. This is the difference between lateral thinking and linear/vertical thinking. You're under the assumption that there is only one valid answer. There are multitudes of answers to the question because it depends on the constraints of the thought experiment.
If you divide 1 monkey by 2 then you have 1 monkey cut in half. You can cut it either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Or you could cut it in an evenly distributed wave algorithm. Or unevenly if that floats your boat.
The word divide has di as a prefix meaning 2. Meaning made into 2. If you cut a monkey 1 time you have 2 pieces. If cut evenly then the monkey's pieces would be of 50% size. If you cut a monkey 2 times evenly you have 3 pieces of 33.33% size. That is why I made the comment about polyvision as a term to use instead of division. It would be a more correct term than division. We normally say divide by 2 instead of divide in two. There is a difference. 3/1 in another syntax could be 1.5. Still, it is semantic and irrelevant. As it is, we do just fine the regular way.
Watch this video. See, how they explain how 20/0 would go on forever and thus is undefined. The problem is 3=3 is forever as well.
**It's a matter of semantics and process.** 0 is not a regular number. It really doesn't matter how you approach it. The question is do you want to approach it with consistency or not? They even have a discussion as to whether or not the calculator is just rote made to spit out error or undefined.
You might have a problem with reading comprehension: I said "Operating in the standard way is more a matter of practicality. You really wouldn't want to follow through with the other way. Maintaining consistency would be weird in ways I don't want to get into. **It is only useful in this one case.** Practicality is the same reason why as soon as people could they dropped Roman style math. I just ask people to try to think outside their box." **As in if you want to be consistent with 20/0 = 20 then 4/2 = 4. It's only correct if you remain consistent.**
English is my first language. I grew up in the United States. I am 33 years old. I attended k-12, and 6 years of college. 2 Community. 4 at a university. I have 3 degrees. I was always in advanced English classes. Though, excuse my redditese: I have to type in a small box. My two years in community were for an associates of applied science in computer graphics. Meaning my studies were on a lot of geometry and math. With any 2 year degree there are required literature classes and foreign language classes. I've written a book. My other 4 years of school were in studio art and art history. The degree however is just a bachelors of art in art, instead of a bachelors of fine art. Meaning it is more of a general degree then an art degree. I am more of an expert of the art of art than actual art. **Though, a good part of my training was learning to think in unconventional ways.** I taught myself to program in 7th grade on an IBM ps/2 model 30. I know Basic, Visual Basic, Java, and C In that order. Throughout high school and college I took various language classes. I studied German and Spanish. Later on I found duolingo and have studied other languages. If you ever want to discuss Emily Dickinson, or talk about adjective declension in German I might know a thing or two.
There is a big problem with 0 and applying regular systematic math to it. When you apply problems involving zero and apply them to real world situations you find there are actually ways of solving the problem. Say for instance 0/20. Now you would might say this can't be done. Well it can be. Your calculator doesn't yell out undefined here. If I take a crate filled with nothing and I divide the crate into 20 pieces, there are 20 pieces of nothing in the crate. It could be notated as 00000000000000000000 or just 0.  You have to make the same **leap** of logic here in this case. If you can't divide by 0 then why can you divide 0? There was nothing to divide. The math world makes the leap here, but not there. There is an inconstancy. The only reason to argue against the practice is a strict adherence to conventions and dogmatic orthodoxy.

I wish I found coinbase earlier. Everytime I asked how to get bitcoin people just suggested how to do it on a mobile device(which I didn't have at the time), or negged me for asking. Finally, someone told me what they personally used, and it was something I could use. I actually downloaded a wallet program at the beginning, but never figured out how to get money in that wallet. I come to boot up the wallet years later and it tells me it will take weeks for it to process. Someone suggested go to coinbase.com and I bought some in 10 minutes. It's nice when people are helpful.
So, now I got both some bitcoin and litecoin. Both growing in value day by day.

You could get mad at coinbase, but they only had 3 currencies. Doing what they did caused a dip for a day, but it's just going to go back up. 
You got to think it was only a short while ago bitcoin was approaching 10k. It'll be 20k soon.

"It was the little boy's first day of school. He was very excited and couldn't wait to start learning new things. He was having a lovely day, and after Recess his teacher said, "Children, now we are going to do some drawing." Good! Thought the little boy. He loved drawing. He got out his pencils and was about to start drawing out a fantastic story about tigers and dragons, when the teacher said, "Wait! Today we are going to draw some flowers." Good! Thought the little boy, he loved flowers, and he began to draw all different sized flowers with beautiful shapes and colours. He drew some of the beautiful flowers his Mum grew in their garden. But then, the teacher said "Wait! Let me show you how to draw a flower. A good flower has five petals, with a green stem. You can colour the petals red." Okay, thought the little boy, I can draw a flower like that. So he drew a flower with five red petals and a green stem.
"Well done," said the teacher, pleased the little boy's second drawing.
The next day, after Recess, the teacher once again announced that they were going to do some drawing. Good! Thought the little boy, eager to draw something exciting. But before he had a chance to begin, the teacher said, "Wait! Today, we will draw a house." Great! Thought the little boy, and he began by drawing the backyard of his house first, with his dog inside the fence. But before he got far, the teacher said, "Wait! Let me show you how to draw a house. You can use a square for the main part, with a triangle for the roof. The door can be a rectangle and the windows some more squares." The little boy placed his first attempt in the rubbish bin when he realised it was not what the teacher wanted. He then set to work on a square house with a triangular roof.
When the little boy showed the teacher she said, "Beautiful work!" Good! Thought the little boy.   As time went on, months in fact, the little boy realised each day after recess was time for drawing. He learnt to sit quietly and wait for the teacher to tell the class what to draw and how to draw it. The teacher was always very pleased with his work, as he listened very carefully to what she wanted. Then one day, something happened. The little boy's father got a job far away, so the little boy had to leave his school, and go to a new one near his father's new job.
The little boy liked his new school, and his new teacher was very nice. On his first day, the teacher said to the class, "Please get out some paper, it's time for some drawing." Good! Thought the little boy, and he sat patiently, waiting to be told what to do next. He waited for a while, then his teacher came up to him and said, "Johnny, why haven't you started your drawing?" "Because you haven't told us what we are going to draw," replied the little boy. "If I told you what to draw," said the teacher, "then everyone's picture would look the same and I wouldn't be able to tell them apart. The room would look fairly boring, don't you think?" "Oh," said the little boy, with a confused look on his face. Then the teacher said with a smile, "You can draw whatever you like." The little boy's face lit up. "Anything?" Asked the little boy. "Anything", said the teacher. Good! Thought the little boy happily, I can do that!
And he began to draw a flower with five red petals and a green stem."
--The Little Boy, Helen E. Buckley
Also, I read one of your other posts to someone else, where you said "People also talk about wizards and unicorns. Talking about something doesn't mean it exists." On the same topic
Arthur C. Clarke famously claimed: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. ... In other words, the only difference between technology and magic, is that the one is something that we understand today; the other something that we do not yet understand, but eventually will.

From my understanding it is oppressive but improving, no? At one point a 10 of oppressiveness, now more like a 6?

It baffles me how Iran gets lumped in with other Islamic counties. 
First, their not Sunni.
Second because their not Sunni that means they're not wahibist.
third - the last time there were problems with Iran was 38 years ago. They overthrew a monarch. Who was a puppet of foreign oil interests. They weren't 100% religious motivated. There was more than one group during the revolution(communists, students, intellectuals), only the religious group was able to grab power.
Trump doesn't understand that sometimes when you push other people push back. He's too used to people that do whatever he says.

Before the revolt he was actually turning around. I was horrified when I turned on CNN and watched him get beat to death. 
Sure, He was Saddam lite. But in his final years he seemed to be on a better track. 
I wouldn't call how he was rioted justice. Justice requires civility, even for a despot and a tyrant.
on the other hand
"the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots &amp; tyrants."
at least Saddam got a trial. He still was hung, and it was a kangaroo court, but that was better then being in a Zombie movie for a day.

How does someone buy bitcoin? I keep doing web searches on how to do it. I get nowhere.
I would definitely put $5 in knowing it would be worth $5000 in 10 years.
What website do I go to where I put in some money and it turns into bitcoin? Maybe I'm stupid? IDK
