This guy is not Satoshi. He may have assisted or had something to do with the original paper but he wasn't the main author.
Anyone who has spent time in STEM research should realise that whoever wrote the original bitcoin paper was a very experienced cryptography researcher. It is highly likely they have spent the good part of a decade or more in cryptography research. The writing style, ability to quickly put together various developments in the field to create a complete work only comes from well known researchers who have good publication histories in the field. 
Wright doesn't have the related publication history. I just don't believe there is any way he could suddenly write such a paper given his background and previous publications. Not to mention with all the things listed on Wright's linkedin profile, it is unlikely he would have had the time to undertake the research required.
There are a few dozen cryptography researchers who could easily be Satoshi. Wright is not one of them.

exactly 200k. Coincidence that years ago Karpeles personal collection was said to also be 200k. I'm wondering if Karpeles is going to try to claim he lost all the customers money but had his personal collection safe in cold storage.

I really don't think people are understanding the costs in running a business. The margins of bitcoin exchanges are extremely low for running such businesses and it's no surprise exchanges like MTgox are running into problems. Other financial service businesses like Visa, Mastercard, Online brokers etc are charging higher margins with much greater volume. There is a cost to doing business right and still producing an acceptable profit for the time spent operating the business and return on investment capital.
At the current current price of bitcoin of around $550 and 400BTC per day that works out to around 80 million trade per year and at 1.4% fee about 1.1 million revenue. An acceptable business might have half of that amount going to the managers and investors leaving about 550k for business fees and staff wages. Expenses are going to add up and I think you would be lucky if you had 200k left over for staff. Maybe only enough to employ one developer and 1-2 other staff. Not much for a company trading 80 million a year.
I doubt something running off 1.4% fee is profitable at the moment. Much bigger volume is needed to be a viable business at that margin level.

Some rough guesses:
method 1:
just-dice average - 1.2 million per day
assuming 10% market share total gambling transaction value / day = 12 million per day
average bet revenue @ 1.5% = 180 k per day
method 2:
Total BTC daily transactions 25 million
50% of transactions made on gambling websites
12.5 million per day

I agree this is the most likely explanation. I think their initial delay on payments show they haven't had access to their cold wallets for some time. If they did have access they would have used them to avoid payout delays. From the blockchain there is over 200k of bitcoins that appear to be mtgox cold storage. The only logical explanation for not using them is that they didn't have access. I find it quite implausible that Karpeles lost the passwords (he isn't dumb) so there must be another reason for it.

Strangely I don't feel sorry but a little envious. I've looked into his background and as you say the guy pulled off the dream. He was a PHP developer nerd who was learning some Japanese. Being the dream of many of us computer nerds he wanted to go to Japan where he could improve his Japanese and meet cute Japanese girls. Not only was he successful at making it to Japan but he got the cute Japanese girlfriend and then started a huge internet company that brought him fame and obscene wealth. 
ok I lied about the obscene wealth but otherwise it's true. Hats off to the guy up to the point where he becomes insolvent and runs with peoples money. Still possibly better to have once been a somebody and living the dream than never having lived the dream at all.

The banks are the ones doing the majority of the work for the bitcoin services but receive next to nothing in return. They need to provide the branches to make and receive the deposits, take care of any fraud / money laundering complaints, etc. etc. The cost to the bank is enormous while the income they receive in return is pitiful. They probably only receive a monthly account fee which amounts to a few hundred dollars a year.
Lets consider the bank cost of taking a deposit. They need to provide the teller, branch + other fixed costs. Once you add up all the costs of providing a teller in a branch it probably costs the bank $100 / hour or more for their active time interfacing with customers. Last time I made a deposit of $200 and the teller spent about 5 minutes processing it. Cost to bank of approximately $8 yet they receive no income for it in return. It comes down to being a very stupid decision for any bank to deal with such a bitcoin company. So much expense, risk to reputation, etc. without any chance for profits.

An email to Ian Grigg which is apparently supposed to be from the extortionists:(
Sounds to me like Wright was an early miner who had/has a large bitcoin stash. Some hackers found out and tried to extort him. Hackers probably framed him as Satoshi and reported to the media, ATO. Sounds like they are deranged and wanted to screw him over which is probably why they went to the effort of framing him.
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:54:43

Here's the plan of action for you-
Buy a second hand diamond from a private sale and stick it in a nice ring chosen by yourself. The resale value of a diamond will be similar to the resale value of a Gox bitcoin so you will get a bargain and your girlfriend will never know the difference. If you have any inner issues with purchasing a second hand diamond then ask yourself 'how do I know the jeweler isn't selling me a used diamond?'

I've got to wonder how much longer Coinjar can stay in business. BTCmarkets which doesn't have 10% GST has a 180 day transaction volume of 7303 bitcoins which extrapolates to about 6.5 million AUD per year. 2% fee of that would give about 130k revenue per year. I'm going to assume Coinjar is now doing significantly less than this amount. Now consider the VCs and bootstrappers have a good chunk of the company and they have several owners and several other staff.

Coinjar isn't an exchange. My guess is they buy and sell their coins on an overseas exchange each day so that they aren't too long bitcoin. I think the price is low at the moment because someone has dumped a heap of coins on them pushing their position to be very long. Their algorithm is set up so that their price reflects this and helps hedge their position.

The problem is these companies have risen extremely quickly, often within 12 months and they usually aren't backed by major businesses, people with financial experience or with big funding. There are bitcoin companies handling millions in transactions run and developed by 19 year olds who started learning about coding quite recently and have little financial experience. If bitcoin catches on further these small companies will either die or be taken over by companies with more experienced staff.
I agree that many of the companies out there are not safe, not professional and not honest. It's still the dangerous early days and this whole experiment is likely to blow up still. If the market thought bitcoin was guaranteed to be here long term then the price of bitcoin should be much much higher.

I'm not saying anything is wrong with bootstrap. Quite the opposite, bootstrap is great.
However, take a look at the level of care on the coinjar website. Basic form inputs aren't validated properly. For example, you can enter amounts such as -1e4 for an order amount under the checkout tab. The order will then autoconfirm. Logging out from the checkout or filler tab doesn't work, it leaves you logged in with coinjar. They using floating point numbers for calculations which is resulting in rounding errors such as 0.04 cents being rounded off to zero bitcoins and then the order being filled automatically. It's a freaking mess.

For most people I would say Blockchain.info is not very secure. Reason being is the security comes down to the security of your own computer which for most users is not very secure. If you happen to get any malware on your computer it can be quite easy for the malware to steal your private key.
For example, when you do a paper backup the generated pdf file is stored in your browsers cache. This pdf file contains the private key in plain text. Malware can easily find this private key. Key logger malware could also be used to steal your passwords.
Blockchain.info also has an interesting security method. Sure they don't hold your private key but they send you the javascript file which does the encryption. There is nothing stopping them changing this javascript file for a particular user at a particular time. This gives them a neat little deniability trick. When you have your coins taken and go screaming to everyone they can claim they don't have your private key and no one will listen to you. You won't be able to prove they changed the javascript file just for you. 
tl;dr - Blockchain.info can steal private keys any time they want to by changing the javascript file for a particular user and time. Additionally, it can be easy for malware to find your private key.

It's quite worrying that they are encouraging new deposits moments before their NAB relationship is ending while also making no mention of what will happen with their bank accounts after. Without an account customers will have no way of withdrawing cash and what are they going to do with your cash an no bank account? maybe they are planning on keeping it all in a safe.

Myself and the bitcoin people I know have always walked into the branch to make a purchase. The way bitcoin has been, if you have to wait 1 day for a bank transfer to take place the exchange rate may have moved 10%.

The others may kill it but then will likely go out of business themselves.
You have people like PayPal charging around 3% fees on 44 billion revenue and still can only offer crap customer service. I don't know how these bitcoin startups think they are going to make a dollar with lower fee structures and heavy debt from VC funding. They don't operate in an alternate universe where profit isn't needed and staff work for free. They operate in the same universe as other financial service companies with higher fees and higher volume.

There is no rule and I'm not sure why you are trying to categorize such a thing. The bitcoin paper looks to me like it was written by an academic who was most likely at an advanced level such as assoc. prof or prof level. This could be of any age late 20's and older.

Sticking our heads in the sand and ignoring negative news about bitcoin is not the way the community should be behaving. If people can make note of the negatives, problems will be overcome and bitcoin will be stronger. Currently this is one of my biggest concerns about bitcoin. I tried to do a PSA to alert people to a major security risk with a popular bitcoin service. PSA has so far been ignored as is typical with any negative post. While this keeps up the hackers will continue to win.

Holly fud. You are spot on. This is a moronic attempt at manipulation which is beyond obvious. Combine that with the previous announcements and you can almost guarantee this whole charade has been orchestrated by a Gox insider. I'm sitting here with the popcorn. This is getting very interesting.

The banks have always been a big concern with bitcoin in Australia. Australia's banking system largely consists of the four big banks, smaller banks owned by them, regional banks and some other customer owned banks. 
Two of the big four have rejected coinjar and it appears the other two big banks want nothing to do with it either. 
My guess is Coinjar will need to look for an account with a smaller customer owned credit union or perhaps a foreign owned bank. This will be a big step backwards as the number of physical branches is reduced.
Thinking about it, I don't know why any bank would want to deal with a business such as coinjar. Coinjar's customers walk into a branch and make deposits, spend time with the teller costing the bank money. What fee does the bank get out of that? nothing! they probably only get a small monthly fee from the business and need to do so much work for that fee. It's a sure loss making exercise for the bank.
@_date: 2014-03-08 12:51:00
I think a reasonable fee would be in the range 2-7% on top of US exchange rates after conversion to AUD. I'm not sure how possible that is at the moment.

@_date: 2014-11-16 00:36:21
ok, that's fine. However, if the counter party is paying the dividend rather than the company then the market price (on your market) should be very different from the listed companies stock market price to account for the difference. In addition the liquidity on your market would be very different from the liquidity on the open stock market which would again effect the price. Does that sound right?

Not really correct about the auction. It depends on if the seller is GST registered or not. If they are registered then the $100 would also include a GST component. Bitcoin is being treated as a good in the same way as an auction. If the seller of the bitcoin is GST registered then they need to collect GST (included in the sale price).
Does the knockdown price include GST?
Auctions may be conducted on either a GST 'inclusive' of the hammer price or an 'exclusive' of the hammer price basis. This will depend on the type of auction being held and will be stated in the auction catalogues and our website.
GST 'inclusive' auctions have the GST included in the 'hammer' price.
Example: Hammer Price = $100 + Buyers Premium (10%) = $110 (including GST)
GST 'exclusive' auctions have the GST added to the 'hammer' price.
Example: Hammer Price = $100 + Buyers Premium (10%) + GST (10%) = $121(including GST)
When does GST apply?
Whether GST is applicable on the sale will depend on the status of the vendor. A registered vendor will be required to charge GST regardless of the status of the purchaser. An unregistered vendor will not be required to charge GST.
It is to be noted that if the vendor is registered for GST, all items sold on their behalf will have GST apply.
GST registered vendors are noted in the printed auction catalogues and on your invoice with a (*).

Remember the BTC were not listed as an asset of the company in the bankruptcy protection documents. If it wasn't listed as a company asset he may be able to move it. I'm going to predict he is claiming this amount as his. He lost all customer deposits + 100k of his own inside Gox. In addition he had 200k of his own which wasn't part of Gox.
@_date: 2014-04-12 13:43:52
at the moment, with coinjar, you could do a bank transfer or walk into any NAB branch and make a deposit. It might be the case that many people use the bank transfer option. I liked walking into the branch because it is quicker and minimized price movements while the order is being filled.
@_date: 2014-11-15 02:19:22
Wouldn't this essentially be a CFD provider that takes bitcoin payments? It would rely on trusting the completely unregulated provider (you) to do the right thing and either purchase the underlying or at least hedge for protection.
Anyone willing to trust such a platform and hand their money over to it would be crazy in my opinion.

He appears to be running the splitting function from the stolen Gox source code.
$tx = \Util\Bitcoin::makeNormalTx($input, round(mt_rand($amount*0.4, $amount*0.6)), $output1, $output2);
Using the transaction data shown on blockchain.info I have calculated the mean of the split ratio and it works out close to that expected from the code.

Second bad news scenerio: All Gox coins have been lost, however, fortunately for Karpeles his personal stash was stored separately and he still has it. Being a limited liability company Gox will go bankrupt and he will still walk away with his 100 million in coin.

Given the history of this type of problem on exchanges it is very naive to  say 'don't freak out'. It is probably true that yes they do hold enough offline reserves to cover any compromised bitcoins however presumably these bitcoins belong to other people and can't just be given out as needed unless you want to start running fractional reserve banking or a ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:54:28
I think that explains the domain registration quite nicely. It was probably the only domain registrar that accepted bitcoins back in those days. No surprise that Karpeles was running a domain registrar that accepted bitcoin since hosting/domain registration were his ventures prior to MtGox.

I'll just point out that cash isn't hoarded. It is usually either spent, invested or lent to the bank. When you deposit money in your bank account it doesn't remain there. Your bank deposit becomes the banks liability hence the term 'in credit'. The bank can use those funds to do something with it like credit one of their customers with an even greater amount of money. The only people that typically hoard money are those people who are hiding it for legal reasons.

About an 80% correction to 600 should do it. 
The first time the price went over $1000, I jumped in at 700-800 level. It eventually went down to about 250 and was quite some time until between this bubble and the previous one.

Given the spammy marketing vibe coming from his trading website, I question if this is real or just a PR stunt. It wouldn't be difficult to arrange so that the bitcoin comes back to yourself. There also appears to be a number of shill posts from him on Reddit so I'm going to say this isn't real.

Anyone who uses Webjet is very proficient at wasting money. Their whole business model is charging a $35 booking fee to lazy users who don't want to spend 10 seconds changing to the airlines website to do the booking. Unless you have a dire need to use bitcoin there is no reason to book through their website other than to waste $35.
