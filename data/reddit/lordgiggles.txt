OH MY GOD YOU ALMOST LOST ALL YOUR VIRTUAL MONOPOLY MONEY!

What is really sad is that you think your computer generated numbers are more valuable then tangable money.

No my example fits, bitcoin is a poorly thought out fad with no actual benefits to it.

This is LITERALLY false, as my bank does not accept bitcoin. the IRS views bitcoin as PROPERTY and not CURRENCY. You seem to be ignoring the facts that it is a completely useless invention that is a side grade to actual currency rather then upgrade. ATM debit cards already exist, CASH already exists as a tangible thing, so bitcoin fulfills no needs and provides nothing. It is a novelty and a fad. 
If I am wrong, what exactly have I lost? I didn't get in on the risky bitcoin craze and...my money is still as valuable as it was before?

Easy, the paper is recegnized by a government and accepted as legal tender, backed by GDP and labor of its economy. Pocket change I can melt down for metal, its tangible. 
Virtual numbers provide nothing, are backed by no one. If you are so sure of your virtual money then perhaps you are willing to buy virtual oceanside property I own in virtual missouri beach along the warm wonderful virtual american ocean. trade you 50,000 bitcoins for it.

1. Go to anyone on the street and tell them you will trade them a bit coin for a dollar amount equal to what you believe the bitcoin is worth. That reaction you get? that "fuck no" response? that tells you exactly how much a bitcoin is actually worth. 
2. My bank balance is backed by GDP and labor. I go to the bank after seeing my imaginary amount and request said amount be made real...it happens. Because it is backed by labor and GDP. My steam account IS worthless. My cable TV subscription IS worthless, the enjoyment i get out of it is what gives it value to me. I cannot trade my "fun" for cash. but then again I do not use my fun as currency. 
Again, what purpose does a bit coin serve. how is it transferable to real if it has no backing, it has no value, and it has no worth. It transfers to nothing, it translates to nothing, its not consumable, it provides no nourishment or enjoyment, it is trivial and worthless in every sense of the word.

Some people jump on the laser disc, and others stick with VHS...
How is that laser disc collection going?
