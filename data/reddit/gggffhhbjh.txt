I guess in theory they could still spoof every other node your node was connected too though..

Coinbase is not a particularly good option. Localbitcoins or coinfloor.co.uk or kraken.com are better.

Sounds good. May I ask what bank you sent from?

I haven't tried this but maybe if you send to their USD account you'll get USD? The best way to get funds into kraken is to open a  smart current account which allows sending EUR by sepa for only £2.49 the actual fx conversion is so cheap you won't notice it. The EUR market is nice and liquid there are no receiving fees for sepa on krakens end.

They have a GBP account in Estonia. It costs them £10 to receive a transfer and costs the sender usually £10-£25 per transfer, so yea it still sucks - but it is in GBP not EUR. If they could get around the £10 receiving fee, the tsb.co.uk cash account appears to have free GBP transfers to europe which would potentially allow the whole process to work without fees. Even with their £10 receiving fee, it might not be so terrible if the sending fees can be eliminated (by using a tsb cash account) so you're only paying £10 for the transfer and no exchange fees.. it's starting to be competitive with kraken + fidorbank, but I think that combination is still marginally better.

Yea perhaps. That's why localbitcoins PayPal has such a huge premium and/or requires passport/id verification. Its not that trading via PayPal is impossible its just not worth it IMO. Look at libertyx.com or localbitcoins cash deposit options instead.

Wire all the money to bitstamp in one go sounds like your best option IMO.

They're OK. AFAIK they don't take us customers and you do need to verify for any fiat transactions.

They make you pay by friends and family gift transfer which can't be charged back through PayPal. You can charge back your cc but then you forfeit your PayPal acct.

Bitcoin.com is like Linux.com

Its hard to know.. Can be next day but might be 3-7 days.
@_date: 2017-01-15 17:19:47
Don't. Use cash for libertyx.com or localbitcoins cash deposit

There's already xbtprovider and the Gibraltar etn..
