You are right that it was more violent but his argument was not that the world was more peaceful back then.

Since 1694 at least.

Telling me to read up on Economics is not an argument.

Ok. Capitalism is not a system for increasing happiness.
It is a system for allocating scarce resources that have alternative uses.
Your using the wrong 'measuring stick'.
@_date: 2018-07-19 12:05:48
If you think capitalism is not successful, you must have a measure of what it would be if it was successful.
What is the measure that your using that tells you that capitalism is not 'successful'?

The energy that it costs to mine Bitcoin is not what gives it value.

Specifically what inflation are you taking about?
@_date: 2018-07-19 12:01:58
We can discuss the reason for inflation if you like.
@_date: 2018-07-12 18:23:32
Inflation is an increase in the money supply. There is inflation of Bitcoin. It's just a controlled inflation. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 12:30:26
Good argument. I concede.
Happiness is how we measure the success of capitalism.
Not, for example, comparing it to other systems that organize the use of resources, like communism, or feudalism.
Comparing it to other systems that hope to achieve the same goal would be a silly way to measure success.

Yes it is created, but in a controlled fashion. That along with very specific properties makes it suitable as money and has become very valuable.

"it's not about taking, it's about sharing" - it's because of people like you that Satoshi created Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 20:24:11
How do you define money?
@_date: 2018-07-21 16:46:04
What do you mean?

This is not conspiracy BS. This is how the dollar is. Did you not know this?

His point is not that it is perfect. His point is that it is free manipulation by a centralised authority.

You don't need inflation to reward people for investing.
Also, you don't have the right to choose to penalize people for not investing because you believe that it is wrong.
Ironically, this is one of the principal ethos' of Bitcoin. To take the power from people like you who think that they can take from others.
@_date: 2018-07-12 20:26:30
Well I agree with everything you said except the first part. The term hard money applies very well to Bitcoin. This is a positive thing. This is why all the following things you said at true. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:29:57
Money does not 'need motivation' to be used.
Money is merely a medium of exchange. Individuals will exchange their money for goods and services that they need.
If you think inflation exists to make people move money, i'm afraid you have been misled.
It may perform that function as a consequence, but the real reason for inflation is not this.
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:17:32
At what angle is inflation of the money supply a positive thing?
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:41:43
What do you mean by price inflating? Are you suggesting that the price of Bitcoin is rising because of inflation?
@_date: 2018-07-22 12:32:20
No. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 20:59:23
i don't think he knows what inflation is...

"It makes a market where you are rewarded for investing in others. And penalised for just sitting on your pile of cash."
Argument: "You don't need inflation to reward people for investing.
Also, you don't have the right to choose to penalize people for not investing because you believe that it is wrong.
Ironically, this is one of the principal ethos' of Bitcoin. To take the power from people like you who think that they can take from others."

Restricted emission has no effect on price other than lowering it.
