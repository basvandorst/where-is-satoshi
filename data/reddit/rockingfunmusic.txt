Has it ever occurred to anyone , this person is NOT an attacker but a tremendous mathematician who has studied and worked 5 spirals deep to catch thieves and help fix the 51 %  problem and cut herself out of a pay line to accomplish this goal-and runs about 50 debug reports a day for the network ? Attacker? That is total BS people are so mean around this network -what append to the fun? Mad in the whole

what about a miner who trys to help there pool and does and gets abused and kicked off of Slush freenode daily and helps eliquis and runs worker reports and does this 12 hours a day and g-hash steals all her work -hopefully the peers in the core can get the work before g-hash keeps wiping out all of us   how do I get g-hash off my tail-I signed up for cexio when I was a beginner -which is obvious sharing my info -so all I can do is it -task and find the cexio and shut  down the run -but they are causing a big issue with my pi  how can I get g-hash out of my system?

I am working with couple of pools but Eliguis I am passing block today because they are the ghash stopper -without eliquis -ghash will wipe us all out -I am a Slush girl but they are really mean over there-greedy -but I like the cz guys -so I stay
