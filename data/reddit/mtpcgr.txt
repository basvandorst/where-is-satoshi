The wallets were still in the cache, so I tagged and bagged them!  They look great!

Bitcoin mining was done on just four older stock PCs with no fancy graphics cards, but it produced very little Bitcoin.  Litecoin mining in the ozcoin pool, however, earned me about 8 LTC over the last few months and I traded that for BTC this morning.  I'll keep mining, but selling stuff on instead of eBay will be my primary plan from now on.

I started back in late April, but I didn't do anything serious until this summer.  It helped when I sold an item and acquired .65BTC in that one transaction.

I bought this and the BitcoinBundle!  I'm starting to feel like a pro at all this BitCoin business.  Now, if only my local cigar shop started taking BTC....

I generated it from that new Coinbase paper wallet feature I read about here earlier today.  I funded it from my Blockchain wallet address.  Is that a bad way to do it?

Can I buy a .2BTC  item if I have .1BTC in two different addresses?  I've never made a purchase with BTs yet, so I'm not sure how that works.

On my Bitcoin bucket list?  I think I've about covered it, but I'm open to other suggestions.

Congratulations, based on the law of supply and demand, I just increased the value of *your* BTCs by taking these out of circulation.  :)

The "watch only" is cool. I'm watching my paper wallet from my Blockchain.info iOS app now.  Thanks for that advice!

I just left three water-proof (laser printed on Rite in the Rain) paper wallets in a local geocache.  I know this is probably just throwing money away, but it could get three (or more) new people interested in Bitcoin.  Geocaching is a tech-based alt-hobby, so this could be a great audience for a tech-based alt-currency. 
Want to help me fund this little social experiment and see what happens?  Donate to or track the wallets at:

Sweet, thanks!

Yep, I posted this exact thing earlier this summer.

There are instructions on the back of the larger, yellow cards, but basically, the private key is hidden in a folded section of the paper wallet.  The easiest way using that private key, they can import the wallet into many wallet programs or online wallet sites like blockchain.info.  The public code is visible to add money to the paper wallet at any time -- like the people here (and myself) have added money to them.

Actually, there are over 2 million active caches all of the world.  Be sure to look at  for an accurate and up-to-date list.

Nothing came.  Syntax error I presume, but thanks for trying!

I just purchased the bundle and then sent payment again a second time as a pure donation.  Since I'm pretty new to all this, I just donated over half my bitcoin balance to the EFF and these game developers.    Thanks for doing this to be my first ever BitCoin purchase!
@_date: 2013-06-01 03:45:16
I'm in that donation pool!  I've always wanted to donate to the EFF and I was finally able to with bitcoin.

Sent.  Thanks!  I tried the coinbase generator too, but I love the look of and the instructions provided on your much better.  I will use the holograms on these if they are still in the cache or will put out some others if not.
