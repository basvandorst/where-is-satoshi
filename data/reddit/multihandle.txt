The Shift card is definitely a great tool and works well, but it is indeed merely a pre-paid Visa that pulls from your Coinbase balance at time of purchase. I have had vendors decline it when paying for equipment rentals and hotel rooms - basically anything that may incur added costs. When they ring up my purchase/rental it shows up as a pre-paid card, and they'll either hold an extra amount or ask for a different (actual) credit card. Happens at some gas station fill ups &amp; restaurants too.

"Shift Cards take 5-7 business days to arrive at your door." 
I've been waiting 2 weeks for this thing to arrive too. Seems like Coinbase could have easily made a Visa connected refillable type card that pulls funds from a customer's Coinbase account, rather than partnering with a completely unknown entity to do this for them. Shift just becomes a 4th hand in the payment transaction: customer, Coinbase, Shift, vendor. (the customers' personal bank account should probably be listed somewhere in that chain too as a documented connection to the customer's Coinbase account).
Like you say though, it'll sure be nice to have that instant cash access from the Coinbase account - it's the only reason I'm interested in the Shift card (if it ever arrives).

Another good New Jersey BTC ATM location may be a place where young people with money are coming from all over the world to live and learn... how about Rutgers University in New Brunswick (or other campuses) and/or Princeton University (in Princeton)?

1 million bits makes 1 complete bitcoin. how hard is this to grasp? no other micro/nano/ultra/etc denominations necessary.

That's what I figured - would be good if this was answered in FAQ or something. What about if someone has a ChangeTip account connected to their Twitter account, and they retweet a tip? in effect they'd be posting a tweet that again states a recipient, an amount, and ChangeTip...

I've done the bulk of my holiday gift shopping w/ BTC through Overstock. Kudos to them for being at the forefront &amp; accepting purchases from our realm (unlike some of the other major online vendors)

I presumed folks could/should be interested in both the price AND the protocol. Do people spend &amp; mine just to donate as fans of the network? Seems as if the price has at least some effect on the power &amp; popularity of the protocol.

could be a useful asset if multiple users want to tip the same amount, they simply retweet the tip - but could also cause accidental tips to occur.
@_date: 2014-11-19 06:54:44
agreed - Tipping any amount of BTC lets newbies know that they now have a fraction of a bitcoin. It welcomes them to this wild concept. Tipping someone a donut, or a whiskey, or a twerk-muffin, or a belch-nugget, etc. just implies that this is some kind of game, and generally no explanation of how the game is played comes with the tip. When I get invited to play games (Candy Crush etc on FB) I ignore the invitation every single time. (and cringe when it's someone I actually know)

Sounds like a familiar situation...did it go down something like this?: 
@_date: 2016-01-04 04:32:44
Yes! This term makes more sense to the uninitiated! "electronic cash"! 
But it leaves out the important blockchain/ledger portion of the concept - this is the part which verifies that users aren't copying/creating their own "e-cash" (an crucial element of BTC).
Maybe "e-cash" on an "e-ledger"? (of course this is all just a discussion for fun as everything has already been named and solidified for years now anyway).
@_date: 2016-01-03 22:09:28
Thanks for the links! Finished reading through each a few times now, and definitely broadened my understanding of the tech details by which the blockchain (ledger) is kept and operated, but for some reason I still see it simply as a ledger (albeit a digital ledger with a strong and complex method of organizing itself and its transactions!)
Actually, a discussion of physical cash/coins as suggested is what turns to thoughts of banks - traditional banks that create the cash and/or store large sums of it. To keep record of the cash created/stored, the bank uses a ledger on which users have their dollar amounts (or credits)  noted - and if the bank loses or alters their ledger, customers are at their mercy. The Bitcoin ledger seems to be kept honest due to its record keeping being done by countless ledger keepers around the world at the same time.
How do you suggest transitioning the concept of metal coins to the concept of non-metal non-coins?
@_date: 2016-01-03 21:23:45
Good point - although if attaching terms to previous word definitions (credit = "owed to"), there are a number of hangups derived by the term "bit" and the term "coin" (probably not necessary to list all of the other definitions/origins of these words that could possibly confuse someone).
Though my bitcoins are accessible to me exclusively, its almost as if they are merely representation of "value" or "credits" - due to not being actually physical objects. Their reserved spot on the ledger makes definitive note, to anyone keeping track of (or simply viewing) the ledger, that these credits (coins) belong to (or in other words are owed to) no one but me.
Fiat, gold, and Bitcoin are 3 things made/mined by someone other than me - all of which I can pay for to stake a portion of, and all of which are representatives of "value" that is "owed" back to me.
@_date: 2016-01-04 04:22:32
Indeed - agreeing to use the same ledger is obviously essential - as is using the same methodology - but since we are all talking about the same ledger (as opposed to a Litecoin ledger, or a private ledger, etc), are you in agreement? or disagreement? the proof of work is simply the validation method by which ledger keepers keep track of everyone's credits.

Choose "persistent" rather than "one-time" when you add a new alert, and it will alert you every time it's "more than" or "less than" the amount you enter (depending which you choose - if you want both, set 1 for each)
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:20:42
Ouch! So how do they decide how much extra (or what percent of the purchase) to hold? Shift says its the merchant placing the hold, but the one merchant I spoke with said that they authorized only the actual charge and no additional hold.
@_date: 2016-02-25 21:31:15
Good to know. Customer service at Shift says they definitely do not place these extra "holds", and interestingly the one merchant I asked about it said they didn't authorize any extra hold over the amount of the purchase. nevertheless, a 20% hold was placed on the purchase (and returned the next day). Is it Visa coming up with an amount based on some formula on behalf of the merchant/vendor? something based on what kind of business it is, the potential for extra costs (tips, etc), and maybe the volume of recent sales?
It's a real bummer to have random amounts of money temporarily taken (held), but at least the Shift app and email alerts do a good job of notifying the customer (rather than what happens with some debit/credit cards when a "hold" is placed in the claimed amount of $0 but is actually something else).
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:04:06
Indeed the holds are always returned - but the amount of BTC held is usually not the same amount of BTC that is returned.
@_date: 2016-02-25 21:59:14
That doesn't really make much sense. The returned "hold" amount of BTC can actually be greater than the initial hold depending on price swings.
@_date: 2016-02-25 21:35:14
Youch again! What does the $150 cover/prevent? If you get $40 of gas and pay using your card, how/when would you be able to drive of without paying? If a customer has given the merchant their card, it seems silly to charge them a random higher amount for the product/service they just bought. the only time this makes sense is when an actual deposit is held (for rental items, hotel rooms, etc) in case you damage or use the rental/room for llonger than the initial agreement. Other than this, I don't see why a restaurant or gas station needs to hold any more than the cost of your meal/gas/etc.

Still not a fan of the tip amount nicknames. Makes it all seem like some kind of game app, rather than genuine currency/value being transacted. Obviously has risks as showcased in this accidental pizza/$100 incident too. Did anyone ever figure out if re-tweeted or quoted tips get re-tipped?
