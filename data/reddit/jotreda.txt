yep, and btc fanboys can only cry and scream "we are under attack IT IS ATTACK IT ALL WAS PLANNED". Pathetic
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:02:50
I am not a fanboy as ya
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:07:18
I am just joking XD
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:27:38
yep, this kids will see 8k btc very soon
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:42:48
You are the one smart man here, sure. Bitcoin fanboy getting rekt by Eth.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:34:22
It actually does not matter, since 17-19 mln of BTC in play already.
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:06:00
What are you? Paid shill by Etherdelta? How much do they pay to u? Reported.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:34:32
In real life nobody gives a fok about security, sooo do u know da wey to da 2k?
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:28:11
IT WAS PLANNED OMG
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:22:34
I mean, you cant win against market by analyzing already known facts. I think we are looking in a wrong way. Just ask yourself what is so good with Eth. that it can resist such price swings? PoS is simply cheating and they starting to understand that. Main thing here is that all money produced by USDT not in Bitcoin but in Eth.
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:21:48
you mean Etherdelta that was hacked in first days it was opened? oh, nice, thank you. And also look at their activity now. Almost everybody running from them. Such DEX, much decentralized
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:51:31
sooo, we are foked, right? too bad, no fairy tales anymore. BTC was rigged by futures and guys from Wall Street. gg wp. no decentralized future, no good things.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:59:34
hey hey hey, wasa wasa wasa ;D
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:22:53
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:56:24
Naah, just was explaining to you situation with USDT and Revoke, thought you would be interested XD
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:11:43
So true. All this "I am here for the tech." and after another dump "Guys, omg, should I sell? what's your plan on this dip? guys? g g g guys? anyone? *crying*"
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:04:32
I am not a fanboy as ya
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:02:43
neva evarrrr XD 
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:57:26
you never know
@_date: 2018-01-27 07:24:37
Yep, big guys with real money just rekted crypto mom's noobs. This is how it always will be.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:24:40
You just got one more report in a list buddy. Enjoy your ban.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:31:22
Vitalik need to give money back to banksters, so he will be pushing price hard to 2k
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:44:21
Grant means they add USDT, Revoke means they delete USDT from their system. Revoke -&gt; somebody requests real payout in real USD. Comprende?
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:30:27
it does not matter, check USDT blockchain, they destroyed 30 mln USDT, thus they do have some money, at least 30 mln of real USD. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:50:44
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:28:13
I want to invite you to Saudi Arabia. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:38:14
How it is not a crime?
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:48:49
Naah, I am really worried about 50 mln tethers printed outta nowhere. Like really, boom 50 mln and they started to pump IOTA. Like Bitfinex :) But overall, see u in January. Wake me up when Janptember ends.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:37:06
well, then we dont need this notscalable, notusable shitcoin that is only value is to HODL. I would rather go with bcash or ripple, they are actually usable, and bitcoin is nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:23:58
I think you missed the point. You need to get a side: rules / no rules at all.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:30:00
naah, I mean check rules for futures trading and what amount of money you need to have to actually trade futures.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:46:42
naah, it is just of what Ver did. I was not expecting that. Also check futures.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:19:36
mass murder also is not illegal in crypto, should we kill those twins? what about Roger aka PumpDumper?
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:01:51
Yeah, see you in next few months
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:26:04
I am the one, who bought half of bitcoin at 19.5k and dont even panic.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:21:06
with that Roger aka Big Mouth in play around, lets correct, 20k in December, around 25-27 in January ;)
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:33:08
so, there are some laws? can you please list them or give a link? really appreciate 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:56:03
Gimme some trillions of that, ok?
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:29:15
np, just want to notice that it is not investment advice or smth. like that. cuz some mericans can sue me XD
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:37:42
Oh, wow, what is next Roger? "I think child's rapes are not crime?" or maybe "I think being gay is not a crime?". Come on, bring it all on the table.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:15:49
lol, "criminals", gtfo since you only see opportunity in bitcoin to get some money and nothing more.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:51:31
how's it going folks? so futures had no impact on bicoin? LOL
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:44:10
so, no rules at all.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:01:19
Ok, 18500 at max by the end of the January. 18.5k outta nowhere. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:49:30
Tom Lee says: PLS HOLD MY BAGS THEY ARE TOOOOO HEAVY PLS PLS PLS 
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:25:33

100% he is
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:31:13
Kinda, even if they say it will be fixed ATH 20k and never move down or up again I will be happy, because it is really easy to move money with bitcoin and be sure that if u want to move them u move them, not like fill 100000000 papers for bank
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:11:01

In January when facts became public and lots of ppl started to realize what USDT is price was falling and they printed 750 mln. YEAH, NATURAL
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:28:48
yeah, sure, all those friends of yours just put almost 3bn to market like Bitfinex did. yeah, tell me more. just ignore USDT
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:52:55
because 20k is USDT fraud, nobody cares, everybody was screaming TOZEMOON instead of looking at the issue. REKT. Hype is gone, I dont see new ppl TRUST bitcoin, everybody just wants their money back and cashout with no lost. Massive fraud
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:38:08
lol, I dont even own bcash, omg u r such a bitcoin cunt, as usual, sissy ass b1tch screaming "WE ARE UNDER ATTACK UNDER ATTACK OMG MOON PLS SIR LAMBO WEN"
@_date: 2018-03-30 10:56:55
thats what they want, thats how real market works - eliminating ppl who dont deserve anything. it will be falling and falling and falling and falling untill nobody trust it. there will be buyers for sure ^^
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:07:48
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:02:26

@_date: 2018-03-16 16:02:08
I think you dont understand what is bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:54:40
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:07:22
main problem - your money not yours (bank get them)
bitcoin - your bitcoin
try to get back from your bank like 100k USD? Would it be sooooo simple? Or maybe it will be like this: pls get 10 forms filled, pls provide us with 10 years history of your salary so we can be sure this money legal, etc, etc, etc. WTF I JUST WANT MY MONEY :)
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:15:12
THAT IS SO BULLISH WOW
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:13:52

oh, no
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:36:18
yep, sure I am poor, cry me a river bro :)
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:02:34
because ppl are stupid, they thought Futures are great and a door to big money, but in reality Futures is what ruined BTC
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:29:02
yeah, tell me more pussy, are u afraid? go back to mommy now
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:52:33
total bullshit, and we see BTC hitting 6-7k is a sign that this article is simple FOMO bullshit. Now everbody knows that price above 6k was HIGHLY made by USDT / Tether, even Brock Pierce admits that BTC made it above 2k with USDT. Good luck having your money stolen by scammers :)
@_date: 2018-03-29 08:02:11
TOZEMOON right NOW! get a job retard, thx for your money though
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:21:36

@_date: 2018-03-30 12:20:57
I am deadly serious, if u still dont get it whats going on, well, too bad for u. I am the one who look at facts and not on some optimistic bullshit in this sub as 99% others do.
@_date: 2018-03-28 13:13:53
dont cry sissy ass b1tch, go back to your mommy :)
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:50:45
keep hodling down to the 500 USD
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:10:52
thats the problem, it was all great and good while we were playing in sandbox with small frauds but once all this Futures and other shit from big boys hit the market - that was the end. U can never win against PRO fraud ppl. Thats it. Period.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:43:30

@_date: 2018-03-29 11:15:35
100k USD by the end of the year, 100%
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:03:35
in short: all price above 4-5k was made artificially. nobody is selling, they just "released" the price. that is what needed to keep market in shadows for a while because of dozen shit ICOs. You dont want to be a reason why SEC, CFTF and other scary shit getting their eye on the crypto right? Thats what happening
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:14:11
WOW THAT IS SO BULLISH, LIKE 5k USD BULLISH
