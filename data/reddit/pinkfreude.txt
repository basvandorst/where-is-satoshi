You disparage bitcoin; yet express an interest in profiting off of them. And you say nothing about why the MtGox price is lower. I am not quite sure what to make of your comment.

That really depends on how many people see said butt cheeks, don't you think?

Why would MtGox go down? I thought they were just dealing with the transaction malleability issue that everyone else is dealing with as well. Business seems to be normal on coinbase...

I dunno that looks kinda dangerous: 
@_date: 2014-07-13 01:01:27
Do you know whether the transaction malleability exploit that was used to rob MtGox could have worked againts paper wallets?
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:47:32
How would they have become insolvent? Are you suggesting MtGox had a lot of BTC in silk road?
@_date: 2014-02-02 01:27:50
What happens to all the unrecoverable Bitcoins? I have about 0.23 bitcoins in a wallet I've long since lost access to. There must be a lot out there, and I just wonder because the total number of bitcoins is going to pretty much max out soon.

Is that seriously how MtGox went down? Hard to imagine they were THAT careless

So... is it a coincidence that MtGox's low bitcoin prices and "walled garden" started at about the same time as the latest Silk Road debacle?
@_date: 2014-02-15 18:26:00
Both, actually. On behalf of the cave-dwelling mentally retarted cat people, I thank you for your thoughtful and informative answer to my simple question. You are an asset to the r/bitcoin community.

3 months have passed. Has Coinbase refunded your cash yet?
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:54:08
So are bitcoins actually being traded for those low prices on MtGox? If not, how is the price changing there?
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:56:04
I wasn't trying to question you - just curious what you saw as a "typical growth period." Did you just buy after the price slowly started going up again?
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:00:27
I just had a dream that Bitcoin hit $50,000. I woke up to see it was only up to $2700 on Coinbase, and was like "meh, good enough"
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:37:37


But what's a "typical" growth period?
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:34:30
Good luck getting the IRS to let you deduct that though
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:55:13
And what will happen to the value of that BTC if BIP148 doesn't pass

Cryptocurrency addiction is real and can be life-threatening. Transfer your BTC to me immediately and stop this problem before it ruins your life.

Won't it hurt their mining fees, just like UASF segwit? [Sorry, bitcoin noob]
@_date: 2017-06-05 04:11:49
Why would miners be any more keen to accept that?
