Roger Ver, incarcerated for sending explosives through the mail and his buddies, billionaire Calvin Ayre who made his fortune by ripping people off with gambling apps, Craig Wright the fake Satoshi and Jihan Wu who talks about f____ing mothers. These are the clowns controlling and manipulating Bitcoin Cash. This is the ugly face of Bitcoin Cash

Roger Ver was incarcerated in America for sending explosives through the mail and he will never be allowed to enter the US ever again? He pays no tax and he cares about absolutely no one except himself.

No it does not make sense at all using the Thai currency symbol for Bitcoin. They can take it to court and have it banned. Why have a symbol that looks like a dollar sign and represents fiat currency??????? Why copy another countries  symbol in the first place? What's the point? Does Bitcoin come from Thailand? LOL

Why on earth would anyone want the Thai Bhat symbol that represents the Thai currency as the Bitcoin symbol??? Yes Bitcoin deserves the right symbol but the double stroke B that looks like a dollar sign is not very innovative. My God we need to get right away from fiat looking signs. Isn't Bitcoin supposed to be a brand new digital currency? What's wrong with Unicode Character U+0243? The Thai government can actually have the use of current Bitcoin symbol taken to court and have it banned. The current symbol belongs to the Thais not Bitcoin. Hey let's create a new currency and use the Thai logo. Wow how ingenious. How innovative. LOL

The people of Thailand are not happy

54% of Bitcoiners in Wales voted for this Unicode symbol

Wow. Such creative thinking. Using a symbol that resembles the Thai baht is ridiculous. Are we serious? It looks a little like a dollar sign with the letter B instead of S. Bitcoin is a digital currency NOT a fiat currency and deserves an innovative symbol NOT a Thai baht look alike. Has anyone tried to write that sign by hand?

This unicode symbol is so much more professional than the cheesy looking Bitboy logo that looks like it was designed in kindergarten
