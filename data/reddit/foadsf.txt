if you are doing crypto you shouldn't worry that much about the government. nobody can trace your transactions as far as I know.
about other currencies people do exchange at nights and the government knows that. everything is possible in Iran. you just need to know how.

happy to hear that. IMHO there is a huge market for crypto related businesses in Iran. mining is extremely cheap as costs for space, energy and workforce is extremely cheap. specially energy is subsidized mostly. exchange might be difficult but that's the case for all other currencies. selling the mining machines should be really profitable in near future I suppose.

I was also referring to other governments. Iran hardly has one :)) I don't think other governments can ban you from trading crypto with iran or even north Korea for that matter
 I'm totally against the Iranian government and it's possible uses against sanctions. but poor Iranians need to live. many of the students here in the EU have to pay for their lives. there are also ppl here who work and send money to their poor families inside. crypto can greatly facilitate that.

I agree with both. and raise two more points:
1. one of the reasons crypto is expensive in Iran is because $ and € are heavily subsidized. it is a matter of national security for Islamic government to keep their prices low. though they have failed for the most part.
2. the main application of crypto in Iran will be transactions rather than trade I suppose.

I don't know the website but this is what I have been speculating for years. there are rumours that they have already invested as much as 3b$.

adding to the point above solar energy in Iran is gold. 7/365 vertical sun light in most places.

isn't this actually good for the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem? a stable relative value will assure investors and users IMHO. we might be down the hills of the hype pick. from here it will be slow but steady growth.

and he calls me propaganda ��
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:22:34
so anything slightly opposing your limited perspective is propaganda to you?

First of all lets make something clear: food and medicine has never been sanctioned and please do not repeat bulshits created by IRGC lobbyists like NIAC and BCC Persian... the oil money will not be spent on Iranian people anyway. 
Secondly this is not about politics, but human rights. children, women, atheists, gays .... are being persecuted in Iran on daily basis. and everyday this regime exists is a betrayal to humanity.
thirdly supporting sanctions is not supporting war. this is rhetoric created by Zarif and NIAC. Nevertheless, Iraq and Afghanistan would end up like Japan and Germany if there was no Iran fucking them up.
fourthly I just said "the community" should be aware of this. if you do not understand English then what can I do?!

do you support chemotherapy against a patient? sanctions hurt Iranians and that's really sad. however,  there is no other way to stop the totalitarian regime. giving them oil money is just like pouring gasoline on fire!

every  Hezbollah terrorist costs 800$ per month. how many of them can be funded with this just one mosque? and Hezbollah militants are the most expensive. they use Afghan, Iraki, Syrian.... which are much much cheaper!

you know [who else]( is laughing?

stopping them from funding terrorism and torturing Iranians...

I'm a former Iranian activist and I do support sanctions against Islamic regime who has imprisoned and tortured me and others for the last 40 years.

With sanctions roaring, Islamic government is using cryptocurrencies as a way to circumferent blockage and fund its terrorist groups across the globe. The cryptocurrency community should be aware of this and do something.

I was born and raised in Fariman. and [here it is me]( after spending 4 month in solitary confinement and being tortured for quitting fucking Islam. So don't fucking dare telling me you know Iran better than me!

I would believe that if other Iranians here who have bank accounts in ING or ABN had the same issues. I even know Iranians here in the university who are directly funded by the Islamic government to spy on other Iranians, steal science and technology, and help to violate sanctions, but they are just fine.

I hate Rabobank. just because I'm iranian, every time I have a transaction bigger than a couple of bucks they call me and treat me like a terrorist. Everytime I work with human right NGOs which have the word "Iran" in them , like Iran human rights ...., they call me warning me that Iran is under sanctions and I'm not allowed to transfer money there. Just like a stupid robot! If it wasn't for my employee I would ditch Rabobank years ago!
