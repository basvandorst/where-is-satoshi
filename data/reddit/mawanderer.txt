Don't sale Facebook for MySpace^^ It's an evolution based on learning from failures. I see more known projects become more lasting. Shitcoin is relative.

Great. Bitmain creates skynet...  Each asic miner will get an AI chip owned by bitmain. Objective of that AI will most likely not be to increase single miner profit but instead to control the network. Am I too pessimistic?

I'm in Crypto in a while. I use kraken or coinbase. Some of my friends use bitcoin.de as it is in German. If you want to buy btc privately, then drive to Holland or Zürich. There are BTC ATM that allows you to buy a certain amount without any registration. In Zürich It is 5000 Franken.

That was and is part of the plan. Yet we all should get familiar with Ross it's story... makes me very sad and stupid American proves once more it's ignorance.

Check the nasdaq charts... It's a matter of month until people don't know where to put their money.

How much mass media do you consume on a daily base?  ..... that's what I figured....
@_date: 2018-06-29 06:37:34
Geez....  Of course not. BUT I could also say, every Dollar user supports drug dealer/prostitution as they use the same medium of exchange. 
I mean I know, many have to simplify  the world in order keep up with it. But at last try to be more reflected.... Get familiar with his story and show some respect!

Not worth it, unless you do pay less then 0,1$/kWh and you can afford to invest considerably in a decent rig. Check other coins like Vertcoin, Monero...

That's the whole point. He as an equal amount of BCH and did buy even more when it was low. He has a substantial amount of coins to move the market along the propaganda that's has taken place recently. He is buying literally his own BCH, which solely cost him fees. Aside opportunity cost to a certain degree. They want to kick start BCH Frankenstein in order to make other jump on a once in a lifetime opportunity of making a fortune. FOMO plays the key role in his agenda. 
I bought very little BCH at 600$ so I try to stay calm and see what's happening the next days.

He didn't, stop spreading that bullshit! He created along orhers a free anonymous Internet, which were used among orher by drug dealers. Please acknowledge the difference, which is exactly why he is in jail.

He should have used the money he made to Free Ross Ulbricht.
