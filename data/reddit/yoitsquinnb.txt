Is this website reliable? Have you used it?
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:24:54
But I don’t have a visa or MasterCard so it asks for the 3 digit code on the back of my debit card and i don’t have one :(

@_date: 2017-12-05 04:45:15
Ok thank you

I’m seeing some people say they are buying bi-weekly, are they doing this via automatic transactions they’ve set up? Should I drop let’s say 10$ today and 10$ next week and then keep doing that or just put it all in right now?

Mission failed, we’ll get em next time brethren

My guess is it’s spiralled into a lot of people making decisions due to FOMO but hey, maybe I’m wrong (I know it’s an unpopular opinion in this sub but I’m still on the edge)
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:03:26
ahhh ok, thank you for your help
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:30:26
True shit man, thanks for the advice. The FOMO is really getting the best of me and your right, this is more of a gamble then an investment

Ah ok, and if you were to sell out, would the money go to your credit card that you used to buy BTC? How does someone reap their rewards if they wanted to sell

It’s refreshing to see posts like these that stop me from blowing my money on what is essentially a huge gamble, thanks for bringing me back to earth
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:01:25
So let’s say I use coin base, does it allow scheduled buying?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:54:23
What does hodl mean?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:10:12
Ok, I’ll check those out, but one of your pieces of advice is to see if it will drop within the next three months?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:59:15
Ah okay, that’s what I figured, thanks for the clarification:)

Ok and I just made a coin base account, should I do my bitcoin purchasing on there? I also made a Luno account and a block chain account but not really sure which one is the best for me

Does gdax have an app and/or work for Canadians? Also isn’t it down right now, that’s what I thought I saw on here
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:56:28
Hehe, no debt over here man :)
