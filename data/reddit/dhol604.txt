I guess they couldn't pass up the cash...

Lol that's a bit of an overstatement... That's like saying Everyone drives cars (meanwhile you could take a nap in the middle of the highway) 
Edit: when I was there I saw 10 or so people talking on their phones. Our guides didn't even openly carry them. They used to have 3G for tourists but killed it after a month. Internet is extremely controlled and reserved for only top party members, officials, and expats.

Awesome... I saw their website earlier but wasn't sure if it was the case or not... I'll do some deeper digging.

I've used this. It never really panned out for trading. Transferring cash was kinda messy and the asks were too high compared to market. If the asks had an option of a "floating" rate based on market rates it might work.

cavirtex - Takes a few days to get going but so far so good.

Unfortunately, It doesn't like us Canadians. I'm thinking about opening a US chequing account next week. I don't live too far away from the border and go down weekly...
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:56:01
Hahah well considering that this person is probably nowhere near Canada...

At the moment, no. This could change, and likely will in the next 6 month - 2 years. Tax collectors are going to want their money, and governments are going to want to keep an eye on laundering of money. There are some blurred lines with anti-laundering and exchange laws that I don't think are defined yet?

Also - I opened a dispute with localbitcoins and they sent back one of my escrow just on my word, and no physical evidence or documentation... That's a little sketch. Good for me though...
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:05:45
Good to know... I will try in dispute though. I called them 3 times prior and they all said it was like cash. One even said, fraud like this is very rare, and NONE of them offered to verify that they senders account was legit. They said there was no way of telling until after the fact. I eventually insisted when he sent me $4500...

My dogs mushed me a good 45 minutes out of town to get there. They charge 7% though which is a little steep.

Lol so when i go to book, I select a departure date (that says it's available) and it will refresh and show that whole week unavailable... so then I do it again, and it does it again. Rinse. Repeat. And Repeat...
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:18:36
Hahha... never even thought about it. Very true.
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:34:03
Hahah they do have the ATM... but it's in a coffee shop that only does 9-5 nearly...
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:04:08
I am... I can think of other ways other than ATM that would work, and could be set up in less than a week with less than 1K hardware investment. The challenge is finding the liquidity actually to buy and sell on demand in large amounts... and I haven't figured this part out without buying on margin.

Are you certain that it WAS Wells Fargo? I had an interesting thought about social engineering (Which is how a lot of people get hacked or taken advantage of). It would be keen of someone to go around tracking down business accounts of BTC traders to try target them specifically... Also such a simple question would be a great way to start the conversation about BTC and pry more.
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:17:36
Just you...
@_date: 2013-11-22 08:17:27
Well I am comfortable with Western Union as well too. They give you cash in hand and there... But I wouldn't use LBC again unless I had cash in hand. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 06:21:06
Well... there is an awesome business opportunity to the person who manages to figure out how to make BTC user friendly :P
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:44:27
Well it depends what company you buy from. There are VERY simple bitcoin ATM's which I wouldn't get. I heard the Vancouver one was 15K. This company is doing them for 5K:  
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:48:23
Yea I agree with this. Right now it would be easy to do in Canada for most jurisdictions, and I don't see legislation changing right away...
I can think of a lot of ways of doing this other than just ATM's as well. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:43:16
Well yea... Even more you could ask them for an email address to "send some info", and send them a virus or phish. From there you could probably get into a Coinbase account or wallet. All I can say is make sure you multifactor password and use cold storage...
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:33:28
Yea I signed up for cavirtex.  Just waiting now. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 06:23:49
Fair enough. I've never considered coinbase. I'm curious if it's Canadian friendly. I'll check it out. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:12:18
Only up! To the Moon!
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:49:37
I believe the Vancouver ATM in the coffee shop is there largely on the fact that it will bring foot traffic to your business... and in this case it definitely did. So many will do it for free.
