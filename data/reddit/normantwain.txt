You really think the volatility of Bitcoin is in fact the volatility of USD? Funny how no other assets or commodities are volatile. Only bitcoin.  You would need the entire economy of the world smoothly transform to 100% bitcoin.  Pretty lofty and all things else considered the simple volatility makes that impossible..let alone government economies are switching to bitcoin.

Thats what I'm saying.  If you talk about debt but not GDP it's like analysing a companies expenses but not it's income.  Also further it's like analysing on short timeframes and not accounting for future growth.  The debt can become problematic but not at the scale that it appears if you don't understand the complexity of the economy.  That's not a cop out either.  The economy is complex and it certainly is simpler to think in terms of Gold good fiat bad.  But you would not at all want deflationary systems.  You should look into it from the point of view that fiat is better, just for research sake, and see why it won over deflationary model and why it's not hated by people who understand the differences.  If you knew the actual consequences vs supposed benefits you would pray a system like gold or bitcoin deflationary monetary systems ever became standard.  You're talking massive poverty and regression for a very long time.  Except the already wealthy. They would not need an economy to make money. They would already have it and be perfectly fine. That is why I call Bitcoin the NWO wet dream. Deflationary system that's 100% tracked and controlled.  Poverty with no hope. You're only hope for economic growth..really ANY economic growth would have to come from already wealthy. Essentially the 1% would become defacto bankers and control all monetary action.  Instead, we have a central bank that focuses on specifically growing it's countries economy through monetary policy with the public interest(everybody in the economy it controls)  as I stated before it's a piece of puzzle with countries political regulations and trade deals also being pieces amongst other things. 
If you're trying to end the FED you're simple trying to cut out the public interest and putting control directly in the hands with those already wealthy.  
Plus bitcoin tracks you.  Wet Dream for nefarious wealthy people.  They could control and track literally everything in the economy without any public oversight or input.

Yes I've heard the standard bitcoin pitch..  Anybody in the bitcoin sphere delve deep into what economies actually look like and function using bitcoin as default world currency/reserve? 
I always see a complete lack of economic basics in bitcoin communities and platitudes towards 'new era' 'new technology'  but how does this actually play out and function?  Cost of goods go up or down relative to bitcoin?  Wages?  Any experts that talk about the reality of Bitcoin adoption?  Thanks
And also,  what will psychological make people trust a newly created digital asset class?  It's untested. And whether true or not people will assume it's 'so-called' security will eventually be compromised as just about every technology becomes obsolete and has breaches. I'm talking public opinion.

And also.. Doesn't bitcoin becomes less scarce unil it's all mined?
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:01:48
It's not really perfect at all. Firstly.. If you lose your bitcoins via any number of ways your screwed. I have no idea how insurance and gurantees could be applied to bitcoin ledger but nobody is going to invest their life savings into something unsecured from accidental lose or theft.  The evil banks are great at protecting peoples assets. Bitcoin would have to compete with that somehow.  Also, and not to sound too crazy, the last CME (Coronal Mass Ejection) occurred in the 1800's frying telephone lines and causing fires etc...today that would literally fry the entire grid.  Far fetched? Maybe. Possible? Most definetly.  So a digital currency would fall apart pretty quickly if anything at all should disrupt the grid.  My point here goes back to the deep psychological nature of money and how a digital asset really isn't going to appeal to the masses as store of value. Gold has always been the Gold Standard.  It's all natural organic gmo free and doesn't disappear from a hacker or misplaced password or unprotected grid infrastructure. Money is primal.. Technology might be good for everything else but I really don't see it replacing gold or economic backed currency.  Ive read all the replies here and they pretty good overall but it seems to come down to an expectation people will just eventually trust digital assets. Technology innovation and adoption in general is separate, i think, from primal instinct of putting your wealth is something extremely secure. Gold has stood the test of time. US currency is backed by entire economy. Bitcoin is currently dependant on.whatever the whales want to pump and dump it to.  So it's got some hurdles to say the least before mass adoption and secure store of wealth make any sense.  Imo at least.
@_date: 2019-07-14 03:22:21

I'll just start a new comment. 
How the hell does bitcoin get to 50k without the FOMO? 
Do you think btc hit 20l because of value or hysterical FOMO? 
nobody values btc beyond get rich quick dreams.  
Human psychology would indicate nobody is ever going to pay over 15k MAX until enough time has passed to forget about pumping and dumping from 20k to 3k.  
Btc people focus on the Greed aspect of 400% gains but completely forget the other other dynamic of investing...fear.  Btc has massive downside.

@_date: 2019-07-27 15:27:24
Supply and Demand.  The demand part would be 'people putting money into en mass'. I don't see that happening.  2017 was the ' public offering '  if you will, and I'm not seeing the interests from the public since then.  85% 'corrections' aren't something public will be participating in unless something drastic happens, such as the dollar collapsing, which was the other point. 
Nothing is certain of course.

Learn the valuable lesson of hodl.  That's funny..  I don't think the Jones next door with 4 kids and a mortgage are gonna hodl through 85% "corrections" .  Bitcoin needs to regulate and stabilize.  Then it's no fun anymore..that's when mass adoption happens.
@_date: 2019-07-24 00:05:37
Well you are correct.  I have not invested in any markets like this personally, before recently, but my great great grandfather is the only other trader I know to have seen over 85% "corrections" and "pull backs"...  Lol.  85% from 13.4k is ........1-2k.   Buy the dip.
@_date: 2019-07-22 13:54:43
Daily candles look bearish.  Weekly is bearish and definetly not bullish.  
Beside the the 9.2k whale pump the market has been decidedly bearish..all the way to 9.2 and likely past that if not intervened.  Real sentiment is bearish.  Pumps can alter things.

Why do you believe hyperinflation is going to happen?  And if it doesn't, what do expect bitcoins value to be?
@_date: 2019-07-27 15:35:51
Yes.  But it does not dump it directly into the economy. It is demanded by the market and the FED responds by increasing the reserve banks have to lend to meet the demand.  The FED doesn't and can't force any market action.  The market naturally demands it. The FED can also decrease overall money supply as well by adjusting interests rates. Again it cannot force the market to buy treasury bonds. The market participation is voluntary on both actions.  Therefore natural and sustained growth can occur in our inflationary monetary system.  Other factors beyond the FED have as great an impact as well on the economy.  It's just apart of the picture, albeit an important one. Economic policies in politics plays biggest role considering the FED is seeks 'equilibrium' only and politicians control the rules and trade of the economy that the FED ends up reacting as the policies have effect.
@_date: 2019-07-21 00:47:37

@_date: 2019-07-27 02:47:54
I'm not familiar with the tweets but it sounds like it's betting on either/both the dollar / economy crashing and/or people en mass wanting to put money into a highly volatile and easily manipulated market.  Yeah. If 1% of all wealth went into bitcoin,etc etc, it would skyrocket.  Could say that about anything.  Its basically a "brand", people need to buy into the concept.  I'm doubting that will happen.  Crypto in general is a good technology and I see governments adopting it into their currencies...but obviously they would need to be able create supply and reduce supply etc , bitcoin is actually pretty darn slow compared to a debit/credit card. Streamlining inter bank transaction across borders ontop of our current system would be the best solution.  Maybe crypto could help that. 
As far as "holding the dollar to" etc.. The dollar is fine.  Bitcoin/Gold Standard people have a real glaring fundamental mis-understanding of our current system. 
If you believe the FED prints money and pumps it into the eeconomy you are wrong. 
The only way our dollar/economy can crash (due to the fed. -barring meteors and unknowns etc- ) is if the FED intentionally set out to be irresponsible and purposefully destroy the dollar.  There's billions of people watching the FED and they are both smart and vested.  There is no problem with the current system. 
The FED increases lending capabilities as the private market demands it as the market naturally expands. That's the beauty of our system.  It grows.  Without a flexible monetary system we would not have any innovation at all. You have a fixed monetary system and it cannot cope with any extremes at all.  The great depression was just one of many many shortcomings of deflationary systems throughout our history and world history. The system we have of inflationary monetary policy regulated by the FED is actually brilliant. 
Any deflationary system would instantly wreck the economy, stop growth, stop innovation and send us into a huge depression for a long time.

It's just a low volume market.  They constantly pump at key technical areas and sometimes arbitrary news events to artificially create FOMO runs on price.  That whale bought up to about 9750 tops then you clearly see the volume drop as FOMO kicks in from small traders.  See what the market tops out at naturally ..looks like 10400.. Wait to see what it does then pump it again if starts sliding.  Dump at 10-20% profit.  Repeat.   A pullback at 11-11.2k

I'd personally wait till price falls before buying more sats.   But if your a true believer and aren't in too deep then hodl and dollar cost average more sats on the way down.   Its bitcoin whales that control the price so you never know But the price looks to be correcting possibly significantly.  85% correction last time from 19k.   This would put bitcoin at around 2k this time if history repeats.  Obviously it's just a crude analysis.  Follow your own instincts obviously.  Nobody really knows.

You realize the point of inflationary momentary system is to allow stability in economic growth right?  The great depression would still be going on.  I agree a more responsible approach is needed and we have corruption.  But gold standard existed for a long time and we currently live in the greatest technologically advanced society BECAUSE we were able to proactively invest in the economy and still are. Those 'interest rates' you think arbitrarily go up and down are actually the means we use to fuel growth through investments in the form of loans. In fact, Bitcoin would never of been invented if not for inflation based monetary policy because we'd all still be farming our way out of the great depression.  World got a lot better since 1930's didn't it?
@_date: 2019-07-24 00:33:31
Money is an agreed upon value. Bitcoin 'could' work..meaning it checks all the boxes and is technologically accessible to boot...but I don't think it will work.  Plus nobody understands inflationary economics. Your brainwashed into thinking it's a clear cut good vs evil debate and don't understand how close the tradeoffs between deflationary and inflationary and how we did pick the better system and every single technological advancement we have today is from the inflationary system, which works amazing, and how if we kept the deflationary system we'd STILL be in the great depression.
You'd be surprised everyone over at r economics or whatever and all the universities arent idiots.  Honestly.  Look into it.  Deflationary isn't a utopia and bitcoin ain't no free and decentralized market. Its purely manipulated.

I think the evidence is pretty clear the public got absolutely rekt in 2017 when they did in fact rush to bitcoin en mass.  But the whales sent them to 3k and now 2019 the volume and Google trend searches are simply not there.

Austrian economist overstate the negatives of inflationary economics. Like I said before youd be surprised how not bad our system really is compared to an Austrian view if you understood it and also understood the negatives of deflationary systems.

Bitcoin is an impressive attempt at currency and transactions store of value etc.   It's money were talking about though.  It's going to have to be thoroughly vetted before it goes anywhere on the mass adoption scale and not to mention it'll have to compete with vested governments and militaries they control...so I'm fascinated by the whole thing and trying to see the ' fundamentals' of where bitcoin will fit in the big scheme of things.

Worst scenario is bleed down to 6k over few days. .  then lower lows seems likely as 3k-4k buyers will likely take profits if they haven't already. 
Also.. Some crazy news or publicity could hit and public jumps in.  But 2017 was a public exposure and that 85% correction will keep most sane people away.  Pray for the whales!

2011 isn't a huge sample.  The hype of bitcoin and pumping by its centralized majority coin holders can easily account for its rise and falls. Pumping and shaking weak hands as they say.  Very few people still hold from less than 100$ for example..I'm sure there's true storys of people still holding but majority aren't at those levels. 
Anyway.  The public adoption narrative is the center of all the hype and my view is the public WAS introduced in 2017 and DID flood into bitcoin as the hype promised.  But they got dumped on hard. 85%.  So the public is out. And the majority coin holders made a killing.  I.don't see any flood into the market this time around, do you?   Who in there right minds would buy at 18 k next time?    
The question is this.. Can the whales pump bitcoin beyond 20k artificially without the public rush and THEN sell the public into buying AGAIN without fear of 85% corrections.

It's a damn shams to trade one flawed currency system for another.

It's all relative.  How many people are still hodling since 2008 for example.  I'd imagine zero.  Most sold at double digits.  Then more buy and sold at triple digits.  Etc etc.   I'm gonna venture that at best your holding from 3k.  Am I right?  Or are you going to bullshit and say you didn't sell 2017 at 19k?   It's a false assumption to think past performance gurantees future results.  I just explained why.  In reality everyone holding bitcoin right now ( 99% likely)  have at best seen 4x returns past 2 years. Not bad.  The likely scenario is most of those 3k people just sold or will soon etc.  It's kinda like a ponzi scam in the sense you must find people to buy to increase your returns. Example.. Your 4x return at 13k from 3k is somebody else's 13k initial investment.  Now they need 52k to have your success.  Etc.  You can laugh at me at 52k.

A) bitcoin doesn't solve or avoid the goverments invasion of privacy. It heightens it to degrading levels. 
B) fair enough. I don't know how to safely buy bitcoins without the privacy violations. Guess what? The influx of a global population doesnt know either. They're in the anal probe line.  If bitcoin was a viable alternative to government cavity search you'd think the 'movement' would have a pretty streamlined approach for the masses to buy into.  It doesn't.

The negative interests rates are actually a good example of why inflationary models are good.  Without this option, an extreme and desperate one for sure, the economy would simply fall. Nothing would be able to revive it.  That's what used to happen A lot in history.  We could still be in the great depression now, with none of the innovation past 90 years.  Economies are complex and population is too large to simple ' let the market work it out' that does not work.  You could have 200 years of poverty for the bottom 98% But thankfully we can control our economies to certain extents.  Most negative rate countries today are also the most socialist and business regulated/controlled countries.  And obviously not all countries are negative so the system works.  The monetary policy of the reserve banks is a piece of the puzzle.  Claiming some countries are negative rates right now so therefore the entire philosophy is invalid is not correct.  
How would a country respond to an economic crisis with a deflationary system?  It can't do anything.  And it would need to correct a huge crash simply by switching in the first place.  
Baby and the bath water syndrome.  People assume it's the monetary system that causes every woe.  Its the greatest thing we have and you would absolutely not want a deflationary system..  The political corruption and greed of corporations fleecing the population is what causing the problems.  Not the Philosophy of our monetary system.  Which is why bitcoin is ironic.  Its all greed. All manipulation. And in the end it's promising a dystopian economic dark age regression if mass adopted.  Plus every transactions is tracked.  Warm and fuzzy

Yes but you morons don't realize USD is intrinsically valuable.  It represents Trillions in GDP growth.  It's backed by an economy.  It could cost literally a trillion dollars a year to maintain the ATMs and it still holds positive value. That's a retarded analogy but Bitcoin is backed by mutual agreement only.  Look at your city.. All that economic activity you see is literally what your fiat represents.  Your bitcoin represents whatever price has been pumped. Minus electricity and mining equipment.

Thank you for a great reply. I think you overstate the USD devaluation and misunderstand the principals the FED uses to keep the inflationary economy running smoothly.  Its definetly not arbitrary.  It's very hard to actually to understand our economy and why its set up this way.  Deflationary currency, bitcoin for example,  if implemented today..you got your dream and the world was forced to use only bitcoin...would wreck jobs instantly and shrink all economic growth. Economics is the study of people fulfilling their needs and wants. I can't pretend I can elaborate every detail of inflationary vs deflationary in a post but I think it's well understood deflationary models will cause rampant unemployment. If you believe the USD devalued and it's a bad thing and interest rates are set arbitrarily then I think you'd be surprised to study our current economic system and how it truly works.  It could use tweaks and tighter control on corruptions but that's life.  Look at bitcoin manipulations right now.  That's life. If you really understand our system and also delve deep into the Austrian economics reality you might at least understand how we picked the superior system and why it fulfills the needs of economics better.

Maybe it's just you guys and the exchanges creating volume all day.  Everybody else is saying a hard nope.  Lose half my shit 24hrs after 'investing'?  Nope.  If you still have a wife and kids at home after 2017 then you ain't ever buying bitcoin again. And nobody is gonna be that idiot this time.  So it's just you, the exchanges and the whales. 
What's fascinating about the whales is they are filthy rich.  Probably a banker.  And they dump their money into the market at key moments and cause a green spike...then..like worker bees..retail buys into the "breakout" spiking further.  Continues up maybe a few smaller pumps to keep things higher.  Then bam.  10-15% TP.  Big red candles.  
My storys point was youre working for the man buying bitcoin!   You want to stop the wealth transfer stop buying bitcoin!  You're making exchanges rich and whales fat.

I don't think mass adoption is going to play out like that. Your not accepting the reality that exchanges have coopted bitcoin.

Bitcoin was intended to be private. Now it's the most most invasive currency known to history.
  It was easily defeated and now being pushed as world currency. Profits aside... Is that a good movement to be apart of? What kind of movement is this now? Have greedy fiat investers turned bitcoin into a massive global money grab...trading your right to privacy for profits with new currency? 
Like i said.  I heard a lot about bitcoin when it first started and was skeptical but admired the tenets of bitcoin and what it stood for.  Years later I am aghast. The only people supporting it are in it for profits. It's not an anti establishment movement.

7K would destroy bitcoin.  I don't think exchanges and vested whales in the bitcoin 'business' will.let that happen.  Its so close to the CME gap I see a bounce around there.  I would likely trade that.  Which means everybody else is thinking that. And that can only mean one thing.
@_date: 2019-07-17 02:03:31
The Gold Standard did not solve all humanities problems.  We've basically had the bitcoin model throughout human history.  I'll concede bitcoins novel predetermined supply as its appeal. It also has a lot of negatives.  If you're convinced we are moving back to a deflationary system that's fine, but you are looking at this through a bitcoin centric lens and not addressing the history of deflationary vs inflationary and all thing economist have weighed pro and cons. In other words bitcoin enthusiast need to understand that bitcoin in of itself is a novel approach, yet basically the same exact thing, as gold. So you are making the case for a return to gold standard but with using the slight improvements and definite negatives of Bitcoin. .. Opinions may very on the pros and cons of Bitcoin vs Gold..  So I think it's the realm of economic study and i suggested you look at the model we picked and why and understand Bitcoin does not change any of the conditions gold had.  Meaning You can (and intially will) have great depressions with Bitcoin same as with gold.  My opinion is if we did return to deflationary models it would most definetly be tied to a commodity ..gold or oil or a crop etc because money is used to buy tangible goods. The concept of Bitcoin creating moneyness out of thin air is possible ( so far )  but i think it's wiser, safer and more practical to tie a deflationary currency to actual goods.  The gist is bitcoin represents a untested version of defeated economic system.  So idk.  The other part is it being a store of wealth within an inflationary system.  Can the price keep going up?  So far doesn't look like it's beating its old ath. TA would say lower highs lead to lower lows.  Is it really a store of wealth?  Would you keep storing it if price went down to 1k?   But now I'm getting into public perception and lack of volume this run.   Let's see.  Bitcoin people need a broader context I think.   That is all..
@_date: 2019-07-14 14:24:12

Because that's how inflationary monetary systems work.  And yes it may be at the peak of a business cycle but thats life. I just dumped significant amount into my portfolio at ATH.  I'm not even worried about it. Stocks go up and down.  Mostly up. Stocks I picked can grow despite the average cycle. When it 'crashes' 10% I'll look to the blue chip companies.
If you hate inflation so much I recommend 2 things:
1) actually learn about inflationary monetary policy. Keep in mind the world embraces it for good reason. 
2) invest in stocks.  Inflationary monetary policy is designed to grow the economy. If your not capturing that growth then yeah..you probably hate that the system. 
Its not a get rich quick scheme but it worth researching and finding solid companies at good value. 
Bitcoin is more like gambling. Nobody saw the growth coming.  Probably not natural as bitcoin is illiquid and unregulated. Who knows. It's value is 100% speculation..

Well.  That is natural when an investment you made is losing money. Which is a relevant way of phrasing the issue.. Your opinion of bank money needs to be tempered by reality.  You can very well lose all your money.  My advice is hodl if you believe in it and only invest what you can lose.  Like literally.
I prefer stocks. Its easier to hold.   You own an actual company.  
But I've gambled with penny stocks and had one go bankrupt lost everything..small amount invested.. And also gambled on another penny stock which I sold for a huge lose only to watch it soar 400% past my original buy in.   That one hurt more. 
My point is its better to hold if you believe in it and have it go to zero than to sell and have it moon..   Of course you need to only invest what you can lose.    Also I'm comparing it to penny stocks for a reason..  Bitcoin is NOT a safe store of value.  
It could go to 0 or 100k in next 10 years.

Mass Adoption would need mass awareness first correct?  Bitcoin isn't magical predestined future of anything.  People were en mass aware of Bitcoin in 2017. News media everybody knew. Everybody bought too. It was exactly what bitcoin hype was calling for and you guys got it.. The price soared just like you imagined would happen with mass adoption.. It happened.  Then the scam was revealed and bitcoin retraced 85%.   People were aware and bought in.  It didn't go so well. Ever since bitcoin has been floundering.
Nobody is going to buy again unless it becomes massively fundamental to everyday life.... Like a country adopting it.  But they would just use the technology and make there own coin..  
Even if the masses were stupid to buy again it wouldn't happen till well pass 20k..

My guess in 10 years it will be common knowledge they can easily track crypto all along and it will seem completely normal.

Its warped the other way with limited supply. And I'd argue money supply does not warp price detrimentally if you do it correctly..that's what the fed attempts to do and the world watches. 
Imagine 1 bitcoin not 21 million or whatever it is...  1 Bitcoin divided by all the people to buy all the goods. Now your artificially increasing the demand of that 1 Bitcoin each moment the population grows.
1 Bitcoin 100 people bitcoin equals x value
Now double the population and bitcoin doubles. 
Currency is not suppose to be the valued asset in an economy.  It's suppose to bridge value to the demand. 
By artificially limiting the supply of a supposed currency you simply created a desirable asset that rewards people who bought low and can sell high.   That's not the economic function of currency.  With each new generation being born what are you going to do? Laugh at them and say you should of invested earlier?  It's not gonna work. 
You need infinite supply managed correctly grow with the economy/people.  
Bitcoin hyper archiac and nobody notices.  Its mindblowing.
@_date: 2019-11-24 04:02:29
Yup.  Of all the odd things the shift from nobody is tracking you to of course theyre tracking you was the craziest.  Nobody batted an eye.  Pretty amazing social engineering.
That's my point with crypto.. It's obviously a lotb like the internet.. You have tools to be anymous but it is the process, the actual diligent execution over time without any mistakes.   And some mistakes may be software related like a bug or the company your dealing with goes dark side without advanced notice etc ... There's things outside of your control plus you need to be 100%
New attacks come up often undetected for awhile.  And my opinion is the gov already has the ability to track all.  Probably something hardwired into every device or backdoor in every OS.   If it appears on screen then that info is far game.  But that's crazy talk.  A hunch likely untrue obviously.
Edit    i hope bitcoin encourages the government to create a better currency to out compete bitcoin .  if people are gonna create currency make it valuable somehow   artificial scarcity is a joke.   And the wet dream of Bitcoiners ruling over those that didn't buy in is the epitome of artificial humanity..imho.

Bitcoin is Bitcoin.  Its price is more fragile than anything. It's not immortal it's 10 years old. Blockchain is the real hero.  Bitcoin can go to zero and blockchain will still exist. Look at all the shit coins. Blockchain backed by nothing.. Bitcoin is holding on for dear life. What's so different about Bitcoin than all the Shitcoins?  Nothing fundamental or value based... It's just currently becoming more and more the narrow focus of crypto community because the value of crypto is literally not there. People are fleeing crypto...Shitcoins..into bitcoin...the biggest Shitcoin.. Until Bitcoin dies. Which it is slowly. It'll pump and dump its way all over the charts because it's only value is speculative but ultimately it will die it as blockchain infuses with real assets.  Artificial scarcity is kinda a joke. Pinning the value of blockchain to real assets would be great.   Exp..  And idk. .. Pinning heck bitcoin to a gold index fund.. Idk..  That way it's value is based in reality.

I'll subtract the last three fluff points and address the first 4, even though the first 4 are retarded.
- just use USD.  That's what the world does. And your point presupposes the whole entire world using bitcoin. But you can enjoy the fantasy.  I won't take that from you. 
- wait till the day criminals figure out they start cutting off your limbs toe by toe finger tip by finger tip until you give up your private key.  Lose everything.  And no bank to reimburse you. That means you'll actually tough it out 2 or three fingers before you give up because you know you'll lose everything and will not be protected.  
- uh. that's not a problem.. We have access to our money everywhere with normal banks. Cash is always accessible. Here's a hint as to why.. Because cash is physical and it actually exist with you in relatively the same time/space continuum.  It's actually pretty cool that it's able to that.  Just take it with you. I don't know how they did but it works. Access to money anywhere..amazing.
- for the love of God will Bitcoiners learn about inflationary economics.  Just for shits and giggles.. Please.  So I can actually debate the merits of deflationary vs inflationary monetary systems without this brain dead ignorant statements for which i hate Bitcoiners so thoroughly.  Seriously.

Oh i get what your trying to say now...   Bitcoin is number one because A) crypto is a hollow shell of an asset based on speculation only therefore Bitcoin is the last pillar standing because it was first. First mover status within crypto was very successful for bitcoin...Which is a bad thing because it highlights how shitastic crypto is as a whole concept.... Hundreds... Thousands?.. Of other cryptos and not one of them became valuable?? That's horrible for a ground breaking 'industry'.   You'd expect alot of success and innovation adding value.
B) Bitcoin hasn't competed against real currencies that are backed by blockchain.  In other words bitcoin hasn't had to compete outside of the shitcoins.  Time will tell how institutions utilize blockchain.. Bitcoin hasn't competed yet with them.

In the interest of sharing info this is good info on privacy..
My personal opinion is your mad if you think you can actually be private in anyway on the internet.  Quantum computing and god knows what hardware backdoors... But alas it depends on who is your enemy and how much it costs to track you.   My point is someday everybody buy quantum computers at the dollar store so I'm assuming the maximum amount of tracking can be applied to everyone in the not distant future.  It's an evolving game and you need to constantly check your current methods to ensure they are still effective and not compromised. 
For tax collection they'll obviously have to effective at tracking everyone and assuming everyone is being vigilant at hiding there bitcoin. 
Anyway... Good info.. Kinda dated but recent..

Yeah.  Have 6  months expenses saved to be 100% safe... You can transfer your investments if you needed more etc.. And invest the rest.  Vanguard Index ETF are the shizznit.  Google bogle investing.  Safe reliable and tax advantaged through the ROTH and 401k laws.  If your company matches a 401k and your not maxxing it out you are literally losing free money and wasting investment.  The market can lose and you still win with a matching 401k..usually...it's free  money.   So many apps and brokerages with ZERO fees.  You can buy index etfs outside of the retirement accounts etc etc..  Never has investing been easier  more accessible and free than ever before.   As a Bitcoiner you will be blown away by the safety and holding through 20% corrections will not even phase you while world panics. Lol.

Ah yes.  I remember giving a fuck about online privacy..    My techy friends from the beginning of the 2000's era of the internet seemed completely oblivious to the tracking 'abilities' or ' potentiality' of the 'internet' via everything...Search engines...aol..lol... Email... The exuberance of it all blinded them and they actually knew everything there was to know...smart ass nerds top tier..  They use to argue with me over privacy data collection and even how Google and other search engines could control what info made it to top pages.  It doesn't work that way they'd say..   Naivety at its finest.   10 years later it's leaks out. Starts to become obvious. Now laws codifying the lack of privacy.  Same with crypto.  That's my take. I see it plain as day.  Sell it as rebellious..private... Anti gov.. 10 years later it becomes obvious it was a fully trackable one world currency. It's just clear as day to me.  I'd like to wrong.  giving up on gold and physical currency is harsh.  What idiots.

Money is injected into the economy via loans to private entities. You could get a loan too.  Anybody can. Having money loaned to you (and you being able to pay it back and prosper) is a very significant advantage.  Extremely significant.  Without an inflationary monetary system there would be no source of capital readily available to fuel growth. The Fed controls this rate of growth, that's it. You can benefit from this economic system directly by receiving a loan. Personal.. Business. Real estate.   Meet the qualifications and pay it back. You win.  Or you can have bitcoin and apply for loans from bill gates and those winklvoss twins.. Aka let the growth and new ideas be controlled 100% by the wealthy who control a finite amount of wealth available OR allow the government (aka The People) to create (in a controlled manner) a constant source of new  capital to bring wealth to more people.
@_date: 2019-11-24 23:56:58
Well  history was rough. Most of history was few rich and peasants and slaves. 
Yes.  Saving money in an inflationary system is not smart. New businesses new ideas heck new people with population growth... Everything is growing because the world is growing..  You gotta invest!  Part of reason we have government approved 401k investment programs is because that's where the money is bring used.  
Its kinda beautiful.  Government provides capital to fund new ideas and the people are encouraged to also invest and reap the benefits twice.. You get the goods and standard of living plus you grow your 'savings' long-term by investing.  
Point is yeah.  Inflationary systems You need to invest not save.  The trade off is overwhelmingly beneficial to society.  Only risk retiring on a recession but even then it rebounds within years.

In summary Bitcoin is as anymous as your search history isv when being signed into Google.
To be anymous takes the militant discipline of political exiles and black market criminals.
One slip and you expose yourself. 
Hardly an anymous every day transaction for the average joe. 
You gotta be careful always.
Claiming Bitcoin is anymous is the same as claiming the internet is anymous.
So stop claiming bitcoin is anymous.
Maybe that's dramatic.   But whatever.  My bet is on the corporations and governments winning the information battle.
@_date: 2019-11-24 20:08:06
Well yes, a belief is something you cannot prove.  I base it on the history of government always bazboozling us after a technology becomes ingrained they suddenly release the fact they completely surveill it.  Bank accounts...phone's...internet..etc etc  I'd bet the CIA has some backdoor roundabout way to track everything or quantum computing already cracked all the codes etc.  10 years from now things will be exponentially different and I'm betting on the gov/corporations.   Yes it's all baseless
@_date: 2019-11-21 20:38:32
Listen.  First off
@_date: 2019-11-24 01:18:36
BITCOIN is fully tracable.  Full Stop.
Now your methods of 'laundering' or 'concealing' your fully tracable bitcoin may or not be effective at keeping you anymous.
Bitcoin tracability is FOREVER. One slip up or advancement in technology and the whole history is there. Governments can go back forever.  
I personally believe the government has the technology to track every transaction. Probably a back door in OS or who knows.  These breaches of privacy happen routinely. 
In every other aspect of digital activity we assume we are not anymous and for good reason..yet bitcoin thinks it will survive the arms race..
Like I said though...bitcoin is not anymous.. And your methods of concealing bitcoin have to survive technology advancement throughout all time.  At some point they can look back and see everything.   Imho.
@_date: 2019-11-24 03:03:46

A) cash.  B) with cash you can manually write a receipt. 
If you don't have a few hundred in cash for an emergency then you need to some common sense.   There will ALWAYS be a STRONG need for physical currency.  Bitcoin should form a bank or something.  Print paper currency and call them dollars or something.
@_date: 2019-11-28 02:47:29
Being 'a first mover' is simply a general term for having a first opportunity.  It's not a gurantee for anything.  Patents will only gurantee market exclusiveness for what 20 years.  Bitcoin is open source and you have hundreds of shit coins.  The shit coins are all dying and it's BAD for bitcoin because it means the actual technology is not valuable in its form. Bitcoin will be next to fall because the only fundamental difference is people recognize/trust bitcoin in an otherwise abysmal crowd of 'coins'.   Well all these coins are just open source code and bitcoin has nowhere near the trust or recognition of banks.  Cryptocurrency has not stood up on its own and it's obvious.  Bitcoin will fall with competition. First movers dont always win. Google wasn't the first search engine..Amazon wasn't the first online retailer.  Bitcoin simply doesn't have the network to be a value to society.  Banks have it. Blockchain will be great for banks. People will benefit from blockchain. Etc.

A blockchain backed by inflationary fiat would be the dream.  
Actually the FED has mandated much faster transaction times by this year but they are behind a few years.  ACH transactions will be instant and free. 
The security of western banking with fast and free transactions times is going to be a game changer. 
You're left with the deflationary nature of Bitcoin which is archiac and its supposed stealthy use which I think is a lie and gov will be  making advancements on tracking all bitcoin.   
So i think fiat is positioned quite nicely to fulfill the needs of modern currency.
@_date: 2019-11-10 19:04:36
Blasphemy.  You see that organic growth
@_date: 2019-11-22 02:41:19
A)  bingo.
B) no.   
Deflationary monetary system is evil and only benefits the wealthy. Why would I support an elitist wet dream of a fully trackable grid dependant monetary system that gives 100% economic control to the wealthy?  The answer is I wouldn't.  If anybody understood the consequences here of deflationary monetary system you would destroy bitcoin and preach against.  Its evil.  I'm no being dramatic. Bitcoin, if it succeeds,  will be the capstone to an enslaved society controlled by the mega wealthy elitists.  Human greed will be the carrot.  It will fail. Its already failed. Bitcoin lacks common sense and as long as free speech prevails bitcoin will be a guaranteed joke in history books.  
Who do you want controlling the economy.. The .001% wealthiest elite or the people represented by elected government?  Yes dipshit i know the fed is independent but it is granted power by tnt people and is regulated and abides by our control and can be disbanded and redone whatever the people want etc.   I prefer the people control the economy.  You apparently want all power given to the wealthy.  The world already decided inflationary monetary policy is the best.  It has provided humanity with the greatest achievements in human history.  Staggering technology.. Life improvement..societal improvement. All possible due to inflationary monetary policy providing capital to any business or individual who needed funds to improve their world.  Wed be in the depression still and we'd go right back if bitcoin became the deflationary monetary system of the world.  Pure ignorant evil.
@_date: 2019-11-24 13:50:48

Yeah well I think we just describe why that is retarded.  Technology is great but certain things won't go 100% digital due to reality. If you want a 100% or even large majority digital currency you need a fail safe grid INDEPENDENT system.  Which doesn't seem likely anytime soon. Like sex, some things aren't going to be 100% digital though nerds might embrace it,  people will recognize the need for physical goods and pleasures etc.

Let me get this straight.. You use bitcoin to buy on Amazon through a third party app?  What's the value of Bitcoin when you purchase compared to say bitifnex?  You know exactly what your bitcoin is valued at compared to liquid exchanges the moment you purchase?  Fees?  And what price was Bitcoin on all your purchases compared to now?  Compared to next year? Lol. I bet you have no idea what it cost you but I'm.sure it was 33% off.. Cause businesses love giving away money.

Bitcoin is competing directly with banks, you're not gonna out-trust a bank..... Bitcoin did prove its reliability on the code-side of it..it's open source..banks have the first mover and longevity for proven store of value.  Much easier for a bank to utilize free code then for bitcoin to develope stability and trusted stores of value (not to mention actually using the code as currency accepted everywhere like banks have already established). People likely wont even notice the blockchain.. It'll just be a normal debit card or app with new features.
@_date: 2019-11-21 23:51:47
Well I got into it late.. Like the Majority. I'm what you would call one of the 'mass adopters' that flooded bitcoin in 2017. My first buy was around 11k and luckily sold that shit at 14k after hearing sage and sane advice from contrarians. 
My views are thought out and well reasoned. Bitcoin needs mass adoptions. It recieved that already and the masses got dumped on..every single 'investors' in 2017 that lost huge.  
It's a meme.  Outside of the early adopter tech nerds bitcoin is a scam.   Psychology dictates Bitcoin failed its mass adoption test.  Markets reflect that.

Bitcoin has no potential as a medium of exchange..   Its a volatile asset that very few people would/are actually buying anything with. It literally is a get rich scheme. Cut all the bullshit about its usefulness and look at people buying it to make money.  Notice the term money i used.

Deflationary systems...like Bitcoin... Are designed for the 1%. 
Dirty secret of Bitcoin is all the supporters bought early and will gladly replace the 1% in the future ,  only you wont have an inflationary system run by the government anymore to expand the economy for the people.  The winklevoss or whatever will have to build that housing complex and fund the Welfare.   Cause the government wont have any control. Only the wealthy will provide for the poor.  Hopefully. 
We'd still be in the great depression if not for inflationary monetary systems.

Having said that I honestly believe bitcoin will die   but bitcoin is heavily manipulated so it can literally go up at any time.    I see it bleeding out too sib 1k ultimately.  
I expect a lot of real demand exists sub 7k but all rallies are facing heavy bags above it.

They're are many scams run on bitcoin.. Pump and dumps... HFT ignition pumps etc.etc... Bitcoin itself is just a terrible economic ideal... Deflationary... Fully trackable... Orwellian.. Grid dependant... And in the mean time it's easily manipulated.. Etc etc etc.   You can make money..  It can pump to 13k within a week..   I highly doubt it and I doubt mass adoption is coming.. But it's possible.  As with any investment, only buy enough bitcoin you are prepared to lose 100% of..  I think 4k is reasonable bottom for bitcoin..   That is if the whole thing doesn't implode completely....  You could lose everything.. Or you could buy a good price and hopefully sell Peak of next bubble.. Lol.   You didn't really ask for any of this advice but Yes I believe bitcoin is a huge scam but people are infinitely stupid so it has some potential as long as its pumped and marketed.  My theory is the hype is dying..  Things can change though.
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:01:27
I'll add.... This pump reeks of complete bullshit.

Now that is salty.  But honestly.. If bitcoin can move any direction 25% in less than 24hrs...wtf does that say about the market?

GDP is the indicator of economic growth.  Economic growth is tied directly to Tax revenue.  Pretty basic stuff.  It may be insolvent in a particular year, but year to year and in long time frames it is just fine.  Example a nation may incure a short term deficit on the year to provide the capitol needed to expand the economy thus increasing its revenue.  
In our system the free market demands the capitol to grow and the FED merely provides it.  You cannot have a growing economy with a deflationary economic system.  We would still be in a great depression if not for the flexibility of inflationary systems.  It keeps us from crashing/starving and provides the capitol for innovation. The innovation we've seen since 1932 and more so since 1974 is directly the result of capital being available to our free market, when demanded naturally, due inflationary system.

Where is your empirical data on how new currencies are adapted?  Store of value in something that's never been done before..is controlled by handful of early investors..and manipulated by same.    Basically the FED needs to create a faster transaction system...which they have already been mandated to do by 2020( which they won't but are working)  and bitcoin looks ridiculous. 10 year tested thin air currency vs gold and silver with a fast fiat transaction speed will render bitcoin the stupidest idea in modern times.

Expect every fucking economic news story to be tasted into some bitcoin relevant propaganda piece by the talking heads of Bitcoin early investors...who pay hundred of YouTube/social media types to parrot the same shit and keep thinking 100k is possible while they skin you at yearly highs. The only way idiots will invest in volatile whale coin is if they are instilled with greed over 10x profits. That's it. You buy now and bitcoin needs 100k to 10X.  They got everybody hyping.100k 1 million...so.the pumps suck in idiot volume.  
The point was every news story they.will.try to convince you bitcoin.is relevant.  Bitcoin is a tiny billion.dollar whale playground compared to trillions upon.trillions of.stocks.and currency...bitcoin correlates with ZERO other assets. None.  Nothing.  But...the whales can pump whenever they want an retarded news to get their liquidity.

Fascinating.  Bitcoin isn't very old.  But yeah.  From the 2017 bubble bitcoin is 100% bear market right now.  TA fuckery kept hope alive by keeping bitcoin in a bull flag(ish) pattern and that double bottom whale magic setting off that last run... But this evening it's indisputable..Bitcoin is correcting STILL from 2017 bubble.  The odds of lower lows than post 2017 bubble lows (3k) are now the statistical likely scenario. Everybody with half a bit of knowledge of TA (90% of Bitcoin.or more are degenerate traders..lol) now sees the bull pattern illusion is broken and hardcore multi year bearish down trend unbroken.  So yeah.  The hype is broken.. It's not gonna free fall to 1k-3k. But its certainly gonna have massive impact on trader psychology.  I'm not surprised at all. Might be a few more red candles.  This is not trading advice.  But the bearish channel from 2017 is proven multi year. No bullish patterns exists now except desperate lines from earlier in the upswing...not very valid. And long traders are left with support areas trading against a hardcore bear trend.  I can't wait.  I'm guessing low 8k into 7k will bounce decently?  8k and under I'll gamble.. 6k and under might be good swings...Lower then that is too hard to tell now.. Heck could go up to 11k. Lol..  But i see 1k-3k a serious target.  Sub 1k is in play.  Let's see how the market reacts to learning it's in a huge bear market..

The amount of control over a market to take it from 7.2k to 10.8k in 24hrs is actually horrifying. It's an insanely illiquid market if that's even possible. And it is.  It's stabilized long enough above 9k to convince me they can pump this as high as they want.

Who told you that?  YouTube?  Lol  I'm joking but that's the case with bitcoin.  A mass hype /marketing /propaganda machine exists telling you amongst other fairy tales that bitcoin will solve all your problems and the world will be perfect if adopted and also that ever bad thing that ever happened to you or the world was caused by fiat.  Meanwhile anybody in college level economics understands the system and doesn't freak out over the debt because they know the other number in the equation... GDP.. And actually understand the beauty of inflationary monetary systems. 
We've done deflationary befor...all throughout history.   You want to regress back to the fuedal dark ages and give the private wealthy interests full power and take it away from the people?   Jesus

I don't subscribe to the bitcoin is a force for good narrative..   But I can understand why people who are steeped in it might. Society is not made better or worse by its currency... It's the people.  Namely the leaders.  Our economic system vastly superior to deflationary systems like those we've had in the past.  It's not the system (currency) that causes the problems in society its the corruption of power within those systems.  Bitcoin won't change anything.  Look at bitcoin itself.   Rampant greed and market control by wealthy /powerful people.   Looking outside of the false narrative that bitcoin is the answer would a start towards real freedom.

Ah.. The often forgot about value in the US money supply equation finally comes up...
If the amount of goods did not increase along with an increased money supply we'd be fucked and the Fed would be hanged.   Luckily our GDP grows as planned along with any increase...

Bitcoins price is obviously dictated by wealthy buyers.  Whose motivation are dubious at best.. China supporting the fully trackable blockchain tech etc...  Bitcoin is not in control of the 'people' and only offers oppression if it replaces means of exchange.  A global Orwellian currency awaits.

You're basing this guranteed increase on 10 years of data of which 2 years are losers and according to TA on its most macro and fundamental level we have a clear lower high 'bear market'.
Also past years is the first time out of bitcoins brief existence that the market was able to short bitcoin with futures trading. 
I feel a burning need to address the 'historical guranteed rise' of Bitcoin when you're taking about a 10 year old bullshit asset.   Of which 20% of its life its in a major downtrend.. But regardless.. 10 years.   That's it.  Pokémons where popular too at one point.

@_date: 2019-10-19 11:51:54
Welp it wicked above 8k.  Bitcoin is Still holding at@ 9950.   
We will see.  Regardless I called the initial pump up into 8k...and it's fall back below 8k before it ever pumped over 12 days ago.   I don't think it'll establish into 8k again without going lower and for a longer period of time.  Obviously it can do anything.  I will be shorting anything in up in the 8k,  if it even makes a run.   
I'm still betting nobody is buying in 8ks and lots are looking to sell in 8ks.

Reasonable.  Are you comfortable giving full economic power to the wealthy and leaving the poor people at their whim.. Economically speaking?
@_date: 2019-08-06 02:01:00
Everything is golden until you went unconscious with the Bitcoin breakdown...  People don't buy the limited predetermined Bitcoin supply...agreed?  The price they pay is market value. The mental black out people in bitcoin have when describing its "store of value" and "can't be tampered with" is meaningless. 
The bitcoin market is the most tampered with manipulated market in modern history. Further it has none, zero, nothing, of a correlation with ANY economic data or assets of any kind. To the uneducated enthusiast (who's numbers are growing due to thousands of new accounts posting 1million dollar bitcoin videos daily)  the numbers of investors are growing.  But it's a drop in the bucket compared to traders/whales. Nobody sane is investing in bitcoin and certainly nobody is turning to it as a Safe Haven.  The public learned about.Bitcoin in 2017 and get corrected 85%.  Very few people are investing in bitcoin which is already a pathetically small market cap compared to real markets.  
Not saying it can't be pumped to whatever price they want whenever if it suits there goal.   But your graph says literally nothing.
You want to invest in a corrupt made up currency that allows governments to track 100% of all transactions and easily link them to individuals with current 90% accuracy go right ahead.  
Gotta support what you believe in...
But bitcoin is not the solution.  It's Orwellian. Gold backed dollars would be good. I'm a fan of inflationary monetary systems personally..but if had to switch to deflationary go back to gold.  Track Coin is darpa.

I don't think anybody sane is escaping to bitcoin for "safety".  
Bitcoiners really have no idea how small bitcoin is and how easy it is for the early adopter whales to move the price.  Its the the most manipulated market in human history. Nobody is running from evil bankers to bitcoin because it's "free" from corruption or "safe store of value".  Literally ANY news possible is spum through the coiners mouthpieces( absolutely coordinated with the spokesman of Bitcoin...odd no other market has "spokespeople") anyway...whatever news they can spin they pump the price and then skin the retail buyers.  Its a disgusting level of market manipulation.   I don't know how any morally sound or sane person could legit "believe" in bitcoin.  Anyway.  It's not the fat fingered Chinese buying right now.

I've longed 8.2k and made money.
I longed 7.98 and made money

I did not long this recent dip mostly because I'm sick of Bitcoin.
It's just retarded.    3 million bucks can pump it short term.  Lol      dude when 50 million can crash or ignite a long term price move.  It's just silly. Idk.   The ability to short the market and the fact the only people involved are speculators I think it's got less a chance of ever reaching ATH.
But whatevers.   The question right now is is this accumulation or distribution?  
Feels like distribution..  Time will tell.   By at 8k and double your money at 16k.  But at 9k and double at 18k.   By at 10k and double at 20k. 
Take your pick.

US government already is able to identify over 90% all bitcoin transactions,  that's what they admit.   You honestly think given technology and the tracking of every little thing we do that bitcoin isn't already tracked prefectly by governments?  Come on.  They are publicly stating they can 90% already.

That don't create money by credit the create money for credit. It's inflationary monetary system and it's how we achieved incredible technological advances and progress in our quality of life.  Deflationary system we'd still be in the great depression. Why?  Because who is going to loan you capital when you need it most? The wealthy?  That's deflationary economics were the wealthy controls everything. In inflationary systems like we have the government via the fed can increase lending as the market demands. That's what nobody understands. The FED does NOT pump money into the market!  It's a free market system. The capital is demanded and turned into economic growth. Aka return on investment accounted for in GDP. GDP is the other half of debt nobody ever mentions.  Yeah we have a slight over spending. Slight.  That's why nobody who knows about it in the real world is panicking. It's not a problem.  You wouldn't want a deflationary system. Top1%would rule and  government couldn't do shit about the economic collapse it would 100%cause. Hence why went to inflationary in the first place. Society became far too advanced to allow economic crashes to occur without ways to mitigate the flucations. We can't go through another dark ages. Billions would die. 
Stocks are traded based on there profits they generate or will generate in the future.  People study the company and buy. Sometimes they're over priced but that's life. Those investors would say they are buying the future growth of the company.  That growth is largely effected by economic growth. Full circle.

None of that hype existed at 400$ dollar level..
My point is nothing is guaranteed and bitcoin has grown from a small group of investors towards the general public, that shift changes its perceived value and future.  You have die hard tech types buying up till maybe 1k then speculative traders to maybe 10k range but the public needs to.come in to.go higher and they have ac different perspective of Bitcoin value.  Just saying it's no guarantee and past performance can be attributed to factors that may not exists now as the market grows into different groups of people.

Everyone in bitcoin thinks money is created out of thin air and dumped into the market,   makes no sense.  Who gets the money? Lol...
It's Lent out.   The fed observes market demand and provides banks with lending capability to satisfy that demand.  
It's free market.  Nobody is forced to take the money and it's not free.  It's capital investment and it grows our economy. 
Also its completely free market when the fed wants to decrease the economic growth or aka reduce the money supply available to capital growth..  They increase Treasury Bond rates to make them more attractive to investors.  Nobody is forced to buy them.  The Feds control the inflationary economics by these two tools.  That's it.   If you had any understanding of economics you would never ever wish a deflationary systems upon us.   Think of the growth and prosperity.  Greatest achievements in human history all because economic growth was provided to all by a central bank that increases money supply to meet the demand.  Instead of relying on wealthy people to fund everything we have a bank established by the people.

So why not just gold?  There used to be movement to go back to the gold standard.  Wouldn't that essentially be the solution and where we went b wrong?  America was pretty good when dollars where backed by gold. Essentially bitcoin mass adoption would be the same effect as returning to the gold standard? No? ....but no 10000% gain first?
Also.  If bitcoin stabilizes at 1 million dollars ( gold levels of stability) it won't bring any profound economic prosperity to new economic actors...new people being born into an already established bitcoin economy.  I'm saying minus the huge volatile gains you agree must go away eventually anyway..Bitcoin is essentially the same effect as going back to gold standard us dollars.  Which is gold physical asset proven since dawn of man and not grid dependant -  in usable form. In an infrastructure  already established. End the FED. Return to Gold USD. No gains.

I agree with the FED system being bad and very good for the bankers.  But the FED is, at least on paper and somewhat in reality, controlling dollars through interest rates and printing money to sustain economic growth and stability which underpins the entire currency/economy.  There's no way at all bitcoin could replace government currencies the way bitcoin is right now. It's not practical.  Everybody in crypto wants massive parabolic volatility AND mass adoption..  I see a huge problem with that.
Would you support crypto if mass adoption happened overnight but no more 800% one week gain?  I doubt it.  Cause you'd have just another currency done a different way.  You want gains. 
That's where the whales come in.  FED controlsparty prices of currencies relative to economic factors and it's a giant shitshow.   But whales  effortlessly move the bitcoin price. The accumulate low and pump it up through all the resistance b levels than sell.  We just saw a 4× profit on coinbase.  Some whale took out every stop 2500usd down in one candle.  That's huge. That's one play moving the entire market 2500usd instantly and likely reversing a major trend. At least dampening it significantly.  Everybody talks about the 20k ath but what about the 3.5k retracement.  I think the whales like the range of 3-6k accumulation and 10k-16k dump.  I could be wrong.  But huge money is moving crypto..unregulated..and it would be very difficult to move it beyond 15k permanently.  You'd need accumulation phase.  
I hope bitcoin liberates the world but I see it as a tool for big money to get away with dubious tactics.  At least the FED is somewhat  regulated and transparent.

Bitcoin is truly evil. I believe wholeheartedly it was promoted by authoritarians seeking to both take down the great western culture of democracy via economic warfare and also introduce a global currency which is 100% monitored and tracked by the same authoritarians. 
Also deflationary monetary system like bitcoin favor the wealthy absolutely and the poor will suddenly find themselves completely reliant on private wealthy interests to provide all economic growth.  The initial switch to such a system would collapse world economies overnight and bring about the greatest depression in the history of man. That's not my opinion or hyperbole. That's a discussed problem with deflationary systems.  The only reason we got out of the last great depression was because of the switch to inflationary monetary systems. Finally the people had control over economic growth.. The world become too complex and interdependent to allow deflationary systems to 'work themselves out' over possibly hundreds of years.. We avoided another dark ages and introduce a system where we had controlled growth over our economy. This allowed the complex world of technological and societal breakthroughs we have now.  Reverting to something like gold or bitcoin would crash the economy and once again we'd have zero control.  Whatever wealthy private interests wanted to do.  Nothing coordinated and nothing with the publics best interest in mind. 
In a nutshell I truly despise bitcoin.

Lol.. Sold for verge I think.... Verge made me a fuck ton of money...  4x...    Dabbled in vert digi and a few others...  I sympathize with kool-aid drinking newbies.  But McAfee and verge turned me onto the absolute scam nature of all this and watching bitcoin pump and dump was hilarious.. What a scammy shit community all around
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:14:52
Yeah but... How does bitcoin solve any of this? 
I mean ..  Stock goes up or down 5% people freak out like the economy is ruined... And BTC probably has NEVER had a week with less than 5% Volatility EVER .  i could be wrong. 
The FED controls the Dollar.  The Whales control bitcoin. 
Government currencies are stable. Bitcoin is not stable.  
Serious question..  When it gets to a million or 100 thousand etc... Is your goal to have it stabilize?  Eventually you'll have to pin it's value to something...anything...besides the USD/gov currencies.  Government currencies are linked to economic growth/decline etc... My question is bitcoin ultimately just going to replace government currencies but by necessity be based on the same principals?  Essentially a one world currency ?   I'm asking because the idea of money itself is very abstract and hard to grasp and applying it to a world currency has practical issues

I mean.  At a certain point psychology kicks in and people are gonna be like...What?  20K?  For What?? 50k?  Uh...no.  100k?  Lol! 
Going from 25 cents to 5000$ is highly commendable.. BTC has already stretched the human mind quite a bit. 
But I honestly believe 20K ATH was over the mark already. I think after 10-12k people start equating it to cars and houses.  Humans tend to block things into relative associations.  BTC is nudging for Car and House level mental associations. Idk.if it's there yet. 
But the whales have the base eying 100k while they take profits up and down 12k-18k. 
Let's see where BTC goes.  It only hit 20k once. And it stung alot of people.  
My abstract anti-TA anlysis.  BTC has real psychological barriers beyond 10K-15K.  None.the least getting absolutely dumped on by whales.. Hard to pull the trigger above 10k-15k.knowing it could be at 3K within months. 
Anybody see BTC volatility as a very bad thing.as it enters mass appeal?  
I don't think average people will be buying an asset that goes from 40k.to.100k back.to 20k.in 6 days.  
Anyway.. Let's see where it all goes.  Who's buying at 18k this time?  Somebody has too...

@_date: 2019-06-27 21:00:40
My point is bitcoins overall novelty or added benefit to the world is nominal not revolutionary.  
It's a gains mechanism.  Aka an unregulated pump and dump fantasy land for majority coin holders.  
I mean.  You want direct peer to peer transactions. But in reality that's what your already doing with a debit card.  The ledger is simply the bank wiring. Debit cards are faster btw.   Idk.  Gold backed paper currency/debit etc seems unsurpassable.  It's there if/when we get the big CME.  
Ending point..  You take away the dream of 5 Trillion BTC etc etc.. And you got nothing too great.  A new technology any government/bank can incorporate.  Gold backed dollars and ending the FED are the real solution.  Until bitcoin hype that's what people demanded.  Maybe we'll get back to that.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:07:56
I will add this.. If the whales want to make insane profits they will defend 10K to their death.  And they will drive it past 20k
You and I both know the volume is low. That means: 
A) easy to pump
B) not organic growth
The excuse is 'institutional money'. That is bullshit. 
A) They are trading on the mercantile exchange not here.  
B) they're not fucking retards to buy into this scam. 
C) if by institutional money they average slubs who can now buy btc on their stock platform etc Then ok...
IT'S STILL LOW VOLUME
Low volume just 4x BTC in 2 months?  That's whales pumping.  
The 2500 candle was alot of money but probably not all of it. They accumulated 6k and down. They took profits and now have defend 10k and create more hype.  
Notice how none of this has to do with people giving a Fuck about BTC.. It's a profit machine. 
Anyway... BTC has proved greed is POWERFUL.
They bump it up and people but into the whales pockets. 
If it goes up I expect a big correction(dump) at 16k..
To keep BTC legitimate they need to pump a new ATH. 
I'm here for the show!  And I'm.wondering if i should buy in now or not!
If it starts hitting 11.5k again I'm going in again.. Out at 16k... Buy the CRASH.. And go back for ATH!
Likely it bleeds out and faces regulations as government moves in and whales are taking final profits.   
Good luvk!  See you at 1 Trillion BTC!!
@_date: 2019-06-28 05:08:03
So basically.... Gains.  
Let's face it.. You sound like a guy who would love to get paid in BTC for your work.  
Obviously the reason you scream YES! Is.....Gains. 
You would hate to receive your 75k yearly salary in bitcoin evaporate to 2k within 16 days.  You would scream in the negative. 
People buy gold ...today...to hedge against risk investments.  Not for 800% weekly gains. 
You've failed to show how bitcoin fits into world Economics.. Aside from a get rich quick scheme.  
Gold actually has an incredible stable buying power throughout the years.  
You gotta admit.. Bitcoin is not NEEDED at all and if it weren't for the 1200% gains nobody would really care.  As nobody really cares now except when it makes news for 800% gains...and..cough...huge losses as well. 
Basically bitcoin is guaranteed to crush and financially destroy all newcomers.  Per the doctrine of FOMO.. Those that buy into the top of the pump...your new buyers....and get crushed financially.   But those bankers though..
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:49:54
Bankers have rules. Regulations.  And yes it's manipulated but the manipulation does not exist in a tiny vacuum with zero consequences like BTC.  If a currency is manipulated(all the time literally) by a central bank of a country it has direct and mostly predictable effects on the entire economy and other countries economies it trades with.. So it happens and it can be unpredictable and at rare times incredibly volatile.. But if one understands complex economic relationships and the publicly stated outlooks and goals of each country and their trade deals etc etc etc etc...one can reasonably trade a currency , commodity even stock and definetly bonds if in regulated market..   The more you learn about complex economies the more you can appreciate the good and really narrow down the bad..baby and bath water etc

 "Your argument of why not go back to a gold standard is not one I can really answer. The market will decide. I foresee a combination of both. We’ll need to revert back to some type of Gold backed currency after a global financial reset situation, which apparently is in the works.
But bitcoin does something gold can’t, and that’s instantly connect/pay someone anywhere in the world at any time, for basically no cost. Try this video to see if it broadens your outlook on money:"
Gold back dollars are EXACTLY what bitcoin tries to replace.  Debit cards. Cash. Backed by Gold. 
It appears somebody decided to create a NEW gold at the same time were trying to bring back the Gold Standard.  Of course bitcoin has the added nevermind
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:43:09
I'm here cause I caught the last pump and made 3X my money on verge and a bunch of other alts and I noticed this pump after 8K but didn't catch it till 10k because of coinbase being ungodly slow (and fee laden)..luckily I was already anal probed last pump (Complete identify verification- highly intrusive and really only us exchange- my first bad taste from crypto..but I.digress)  anyway i.caught this pump and actually sold the very top after its second touch.  
One seller crashed the whole trend. Imagine that. 2500usd candle!  Epic!  Try that in real markets!  Lol. 
Anyway I'm here because it's interesting to see this whole phenomenon and I'm learning how the whales program the population to think 50K 100K 1 million and use their buying power to pump through resistance and create a frenzy.  
Volume is extremely low this time.  I bet it goes pretty deep. 
And my original post was about psychology. The most important aspect to all of this. 
Unfortunately, whoever dropped that 2500usd candle ontop of this pump might have ruined BTC for a long time. 
Idk.  Maybe mass interest will come back and BTC will see heavy volume again. 
Like I said though...somebody has to buy in at 18K.. I hope BTC goes to 100k.. I really do..but according to my theory mass psychology wont see a anything stable over 15k.  IDK though.  We'll see right.

Wouldn't banks improving there own transactions make bitcoin irrelevant?  Debit cards are faster then bitcoin and free to transact with already and if banks can apply the same convenience to transfors etc that would destroy bitcoin. Banks guarantee your money and it's safely held and insured. Plus stability. That leaves bitcoin only being good for highly speculative high risk investments.  I just dont see bitcoin being good for much if banks adopt new methods which they are. Imho
I agree silver and gold are safe havens. BTC is high risk.

Everytime it breaks a 3 month consolidation downward and closes below the 200ma with high volume and no bounce. 
Last time was 2017 but we got bounce.
It might be relevant data.. Might not..

@_date: 2019-09-27 01:28:49
Not entirely following you there but I'm guessing you're talking about the	. 0001$ to 20k in 10 years thing. I agree. Its stellar.  Its hard to short bitcoin.  But I do not subscribe to the guarantee free easy money of Bitcoin. I think all products ideas have there life span and immediate growth is very common.. Initially. But as things scale up it needs to fulfill a greater demand amongst more people.  Bitcoin was wildly popular amongst a relatively few amount of people. Small market. Small amount of people even aware of it.  Price skyrockets.  I believe the public was introduced in 2017 and it didn't go so well. 85% correction. Now if bitcoin corrects again 85% I see it being firmly rejected by the public.  If it hasn't already. We'll see. It's easy to pump...
@_date: 2019-09-27 00:44:50
We already peaked, consolidated for like 3 months and broke downward.  Go to the 2017 charts and find the close below 200ma after the peak..  If it gets to low 6k id add another major confluence to the 1k possibility. 
Anything can happen.
 I consider break down with volume and no immediate bounce up to be incredibly bearish.
The 200ma cross.. It's telling in of itself and psychological.  Still no bounce.
And the third would be drop to 6k as it confirms the first two and psychological overdrive downward.
Also the hype failed miserably and bitcoin is all hype.
Markets easy to pump though.  But heavy bags above.  Hard to pump far and fast.

That doesn't impress.  Since public awareness it's below 10k of 2017 when the very first public participation began en mass and its more than 50% from ATH.  Easy to pump a small market.  Harder to pump with more public.. You didn't buy then anyway.  At best you bought at 1k.   Many investments have 8x 10x 20x etc.   Past performance doesn't guarantee future results

Im talking about the immediate hype.  Like Baakt and now it's shifted to.. Well overall down the road it's good.. Same with halving.  The immediate price action is hype and the long term effects on price are about the miners earning less coin per block so whatever.. Less miners?  More hodling by them until price goes up then massive dumps? 
If your talking supply and demand you are the one that doesn't understand bitcoin markets.. You need mass adoption and few more halvings to factor that in.. It's the miners.  Maybe bitcoin slows to a crawl because it's not profitable etc.
Effectively its nothing.. Possibly bad depending on what miners do and has no effect on supply or demand.  Its all hype.

Lol.  You don't have any idea.  That's OK.  Maybe you'll learn.   Deflationary systems like bitcoin benefit the wealth only. If not for the expanding economy all growth would come from wealthy only.  Instead we have the ability to grow the economy based on free market demand with oversight.
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:24:40
I disagree. The value of any object is held in its price. You can sell a new brand of cars for 1$ each and people will buy in the beginning. And even at a 1000$ or maybe 10000 but eventually the value exceeds the price.  It would have to be one heck of an object to buy for 100k. Most new things can skyrocket in price initially but do have a limit. To scale up it would have to actually be used en mass. This has never been done.
@_date: 2019-09-23 22:52:40
You're all over the board here. Yes. There's a fundamental difference between both systems concerning savings vs investments. Theyre are plenty of secure investments and you can still choose to save under your mattress if you want to. Our system relies on growth because stagnation is abhorrent. Think of the technological and societal prosperity since we switched from the Great Depression causing deflationary system to our wildly successful inflationary system. The world is too populated to allow any historic economic depressions while the market sorts it out. We could easily still be in the great depression. The dark ages. Why give the wealthy all control over economic activity, growth and well being. Your choices are give 100% control to the wealthy or give the people control via a regulated entity empowered by the government (the people).   You wouldnt want the desolation of switching to 'hard' money. It's economic suicide.  Unless you're rich.  Then it's paradise.
Edit.  I'm not saying there isn't corruption and need for change within the system we have... But baby and bath water scenario.  You do not want deflationary system.  You want a better inflationary system.  It may happen.
@_date: 2019-09-27 02:20:29
First off the halving is purely a psychological event. Doesn't effect the supply or demand at all.  Baakt hype is worth noting so idk if halving is gonna do much.. Technically it's nothing.
You're 1000% correct and are describing a profitable trading stategy..  The reason I have longs in right now.. Counter trade the herd at all times.. Except when the herd is right.
All TA is is chart analsysis and all a chart is is price through time.. Price is a transaction between two people. Two people with two psychological motivations to buy and sell at that time at that price. 
Point is TA is studying human psychology. You're description is a good trading insight.
Like I said I have longs in for that one reason.
And I have buys throughout low 7ks till 4.1k because of the TA..
Why does TA work at all?  2 reasons imo.
1 insight into past psychology
2 insight into what other traders are looking at
Edit : Don't Trade. It's not fun.  
Long term /cycle swing trading is really the only profitable trading vs holding (in talking real assets mostly who knows with bitcoin)  and you can easily mess that up too. Know what your doing and be willing to accept 100% loss on all trades. Not joking.
@_date: 2019-09-27 01:52:53
Eh. I don't think so. I admit I've only ever eyeballed the monthly and weekly and in all the 10 years of Bitcoin the past two have been different.  I have to do the math. But I'm certain the time factor is much longer and we have a situation where bitcoin is below 50% of an ATH still 2 years later and after a bull run which it broke down from etc etc possibly heading lower.  These are different market dynamics... Public interaction is new since 2017.   The intial bitcoin movement was very small amounts of people even aware of it relatively compared to now.. Price action will change.
@_date: 2019-09-27 01:18:01
I agree. 4-6k is my personal 'gut call' or 'fundamental'. 
This post is not about my opinion though. I wanted to share the change in the market dynamic that JUST occurred and point out 1k is now a reality. Not opinion. It's a factor you need to consider. I see 4-6k but aware 1k is possible. 
Rsi I'm familiar with but be VERY careful.  Look back.  The dips below oversold can continue to move over 40% from the original over sold crossing.  I haven't seen a bounce yet.

I agree with you on 'paper' and it's possible but I highly doubt 4k will get breached by much,  that is absolute worst case scenario to happen that has a reasonable chance of happening... But it's possible.
I think 6k is a very solid buy down to 4k.   But 8k is 40% correction from 13.4k.  So you gotta watch the market.

@_date: 2019-09-23 15:58:00
You forget too that even when the fed actually "injects" money into the economy it's not simply dumping a truckload onto a choosen people etc.. The dynamic is that the free market demands that money for capital investment which grows our expanding economy.  It's exactly how our inflationary system is supposed to work.  The missing part of this equation is the increased GDP this capital investment creates.  It's a good thing. You can't compare your deflationary mentality onto the far superior inflationary economic system.

Look at the charts. 18k bitcoin crashed to 3k nearly 2 years ago.  It made another run, this time from 3k,  and only hit 13.4k..  Now we see a reversal with a break downward from consolidation. The 200 MA also holds sway and considering the breakdown and using 2017 as the template... 1k.. . It's a reality.  Trading or Price prediction isn't that easy or straight forward but... Nonetheless..1k is in play and you couldn't say that until today without being a complete dick head.

@_date: 2019-09-27 01:07:49
Great comment.  I'll add, creating a workable digital currency is one thing.. Bitcoin succeeded (and failed as the fees and times to transact etc.. The narrative now is 'store of value' not much 'currency' anymore). 
You're point covers the store of value issue.  A) it's not stable... At all.  And B) it can be manipulated like all other markets and probably way more ways than others.. High frequency trading is huge problem for bitcoins relatively small markets.
My last point is this... If bitcoin as currency fails and bitcoin as store of value more or less fails... Then the last bitcoin 'goal' is world wide economic adoption.. The world switching to bitcoin /decentralized and deflationary economics causing countries to lose all control of economic growth etc...
It's failed the first two goals so far.
Its third goal is to literally topple the worlds super powers.
Idk.  Even if fiat crashes I don't think bitcoin stands a chance at accomplishing any of its goals.  Imho.

You'll need that bitcoin for your medical costs. Or maybe you can store your bitcoin in an institution that will secure and redeem your wealth if criminals target you.  Much like a bank.  Full circle.

Well lots of people are new to bitcoin so entry prices are important to them.. Guys who bought at 18k might not be looking forward to another few years before break even... The guys who bought at 50$ will cheer this market up or down.. They don't care.  Most sold already... I'd imagine most bitcoiners are in at best around 1k...hard to imagine nobody selling at 18k from 1k..but imagine 1k is about as good as it gets for hodlrs minus outliers etc.  So drop to 1k would be interesting.  And also unlikely.  I'd love to hear the pro bitcoin people if it drops under 1k though... I. Wonder if there so positive and love the technology etc.. Lol.  Anyway...

Alright.  Here.  I'll go 1/6 th at 8025.  Target 8140.
Edit.  If it breaks 7960 I'll likely sell.  Definetly at 7900.. EDIT  again   fixed numbers  and I'll give the trade to 7900.  
Rest of my buys at 7200. 
Risky trade but I was itching to take it anyway.  Let's see
