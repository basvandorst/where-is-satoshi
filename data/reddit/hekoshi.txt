Then the problem must be a lack of familiarity with something different.
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:13:23
Some of the altcoins are pump and dumps, sure, but not all of them.  That seems like an ignorant source of hatred.
@_date: 2014-06-28 01:16:27
Thanks!  I'll have to look into it further; i've been hearing a lot of good things about monero.
@_date: 2014-05-23 20:14:38
No, I've never heard of coinjoin.  I just read a few articles about darkcoin, but that's another factor that determines the success or failure of a coin, publicity.  It seems like people are paying more attention to darkcoin than coinjoin.    
I'm not saying that darkcoin will for sure replace anything else.  I'm just saying that the recipe is ripe for short term gains at the very least if for no other reason than perceived value; so if your end game is profit, than the only catalyst needed is a reasonable amount of volatility and volume.  So far, I've made several times what I've put into it.  So i'm happy with the investment.

To be devil's advocate, if there were viable alternatives that were just as easy to install and use as windows for the average user, they would probably lose more customers.  Microsoft does have the advantage of name recognition though, which robocoin does not.  With a little competition, I think we'll see much better bitcoin ATM's.

Dogecoin and litecoin were both pumped and dumped at various times.  Hell there are times where whales pump and dump bitcoin.  Long term value depends more on what that new coin brings to the table and consequently how many people show up to the table.  For litecoin, the main benefit was in the continued decentralization of mining, where bitcoin had succumbed to asics.    
Darkcoin uses the x11 algorithm, but what really makes it unique in my opinion is darksend.  With bitcoin, you can reference the blockchain and find out where specific coins have gone.  With darksend, you can send and receive coins anonymously, and it's the first altcoin to implement such a feature.  So at least part of this pump and dump is due to the publicity that's generated.
@_date: 2014-06-28 02:01:43
I did a little googling on coinjoin and darksend, and you're right.  It looks like the difference is that coinjoin uses one server, and darksend is done using masternodes, but the transaction is obfuscated using the same technique.    
In any case, it's people's expectations that generates price movements.
@_date: 2014-05-23 20:36:03
Thank you for the explanation.  And, meh, I guess I just haven't reached that point yet.
@_date: 2014-03-25 08:04:09
I see it as poking fun at people's misconceptions.  It doesn't necessarily have to convey disrespect.
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:52:59
Out of curiosity, which ones are those?
@_date: 2014-01-25 14:14:29
900 million is still pretty decent.  
edit: oh no, we're going down.
@_date: 2014-06-28 01:07:34
I've head the argument against darkcoin, that darksend is coinjoin, but what I don't understand is where that information is coming from seeing as darksend is not open source.  I'm not directing that at you; i'm just saying there seems to be an army of trolls and troll inspired individuals that make it difficult to get any reliable information outside of independently looking into these things.    
Even if there is no real feature advantage to any of the altcoins, most of them are more volatile than bitcoin, and to be blunt, i'm in it for the money.  So the main difference I see is: bitcoin waves that can earn me 2-5% and altcoin waves that can earn me 10-30%.
@_date: 2015-08-21 17:16:52
ah I see, thank you for clearing that up.
@_date: 2015-08-21 12:55:40
That is very interesting.  It looks like they set up orders, and they took up to 90 seconds at times to appear on the order book?
@_date: 2015-08-21 05:12:07
Fuck banks in general and their outdated, controlling business model.  With the regulations we have, banks are practically a privatized arm of the government; we need to circumvent them and buy and sell bitcoins to each other.
@_date: 2015-08-21 05:37:12
It's worth repeating sometimes.  Not too long ago, a lot of people were all for government regulation when people started talking about bitlicense.  Now nobody in New York is legally allowed to buy or sell bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-22 11:59:30
Lol... I'm a programmer, and I've owned 2 different businesses.  I was a miner for 6 months and made back much more than my investment because I accurately accounted for the factors involved.  If you're still calling it a free lunch, then you still don't understand how the network works, and I'm not going to waste any more energy trying to explain it to you.
@_date: 2015-04-20 17:33:22
And they went down for a completely unrelated reason...
@_date: 2015-04-09 21:15:49
It could be.  The insurance company could run it's own payment mechanism that limits the possibility that they would have to pay out.  It would essentially be visa or mastercard on top of bitcoin.  I would think it would be cheaper because the cost to entry would be lower, and with bitcoin as the payment mechanism, nothing has to be spent to send or receive money.   I think it would be cheaper because the cost of entry would be lower, and it wouldn't have to follow regulations in place for us dollars.
@_date: 2015-04-21 03:06:42
They were a shady operation to begin with regardless of what they said to the feds.  If you just blindly throw your money at businesses without doing any research into them, then I've got some insurance to sell you.
@_date: 2015-04-09 23:04:46
I would be able to tell what ip pulled it out if I controlled the interface between bitcoins and customers.  If the login and transfer didn't look suspicious, then no.  Bitcoins would only be the back end.
@_date: 2015-04-10 01:33:55
The point is that it would only be for those who want to use it.  Personally, I wouldn't because it's easy enough to keep things secure.  I don't see a problem with bitcoin as a payment system?
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:11:35
Which if you really wanted it, there's no reason someone couldn't provide private insurance for your bitcoins.  You just wouldn't be able to socialize the losses to with people not subscribed to that insurance :p
@_date: 2015-04-21 19:28:45
Do you expect the bitcoin network to run on rainbows?  The profit that these miners make comes from both the fees and the block reward (which is limited by an algorithm so there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins).    
The fed on the other hand can print as much money as it wants, and there's not much in place to prevent it.
@_date: 2015-04-21 04:02:48
It's what anyone that values their money should do.  It makes sense that in an area where information spreads so quickly, where so many people who know about bitcoin also know about this subreddit, you'll find more people that have learned this through the occasional bad news like the Gox scandal.    
You can see the same effect in the car market.  Nobody wants to drive a coffin on wheels, and many people have heard of them.  That's why safety is such a marketing point for auto makers.    
I don't see why spending 5 or 10 minutes on google to protect your life savings should be such a big deal.
@_date: 2015-04-09 21:31:05
and it doesn't necessarily have to start as a large operation.  Even if it were, the marketing would be easy since there's no other game in town.  The second company to start would gain some portion of the same attention just for being the second.  They would both probably be able to gain investors fairly easily for the same reasons.  On top of that, the entrepreneur's just have to have some sort of history showing competence in the business world.       
 Another, even cheaper way of doing all of this would be just to build a new altcoin with an insurance feature built in to socialize the loss across the altcoin.  People that believe in it and have access to an altcoin exchange would be able to invest.  Costs would be reduced to the initial programming.  The makers could premine a portion of it, then no investment capital would be needed beyond a computer.    
That would actually be an interesting experiment.  If the first failed, others would be able to easily take it's place.
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:12:05
This is what automation looks like :p Sorry it upsets you.  (and the profits are definitely not 100%.  Most are between 50% and 10% depending on how crafty they are and how much electricity costs.  These computers are serving an important purpose.  That's why there's money in it, and that's why it continues to be profitable.
@_date: 2015-04-06 12:56:05
That, and if people aren't willing spend 5 or 10 minutes on google to see whether or not they can trust the results of something like this, they aren't going to make terribly good decisions.  The problem is the FDA assumes nobody does any research.    
It'd be way more acceptable if they just provided a stamp of approval or something and if it didn't matter whether or not you had that stamp to sell things.  Then people that want to listen to the FDA would be free to do so, and those who want to research these things on their own would be free to do so as well.
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:39:46
lol.  We have a working example of exactly what I'm explaining.  Your example is an inaccurate comparison and demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the systems behind this.    
Banks charge for transmitting money, right?  Imagine if that bank had no staff.  Everything is automated.  Now imagine that each piece of that bank is owned by a different person who manages the computers responsible for automation.  Since there's hardly any work involved, and since everyone is competing against each other, the fees become much lower, while still maintaining a profit for the people responsible for maintaining the system.    
TL;DR the bank's staff has been replaced by robots, and all of those robots are hiding in people's basement's, garages, closets, etc :p    
The main reason for the profit variance is power costs.  There are places where you can purchase electricity for 1 cent per kilowatt hour, but most power companies charge around 12 cents per kilowatt hour at least in the US, and not everyone is willing to move to try their hand at mining.    
People that wouldn't make money obviously aren't going to mine.    
I don't see what's so difficult about ROI anyways.  I pay $500 for some mining equipment.  For every 12 cents I spend on power, I get 15 cents.  Over time, that profit margin decreases as the tech becomes more efficient, and other people buy the new stuff.  If I make $200 in profit the first month, $180 the second month, then $155 the third, then $130 on the fourth, then I now have $665, 665/500 is my roi over that period.    
And again, you have to consider the crafty factor here.  You're competing against everyone else that wants to run a miner.  For example, back when gpu mining was a thing, people who bought normal pc power supplies were at a disadvantage.  They'd barely make back their money, and that's because the idea of using $10 server power supplies rather than brand new $70 pc power supplies had propogated.  The people that started using those power supplies first made some more money during and before that propogation.

Yep, and the original wound has been there for so long, nobody thinks it can heal.

ugh, that's so lame.

Man, that's why I set hopeful orders, especially in thin markets.  Those were some lucky sellers.

Remember how Bitcoin was regulated in New York?  And now many exchanges don't allow bitcoin to be traded from within the U.S.  Let's hope they don't end up with the same fate.

Seriously, encryption is a genie that cannot be put back in the bottle.  You can probably pay just about any programmer $200 to create an encryption system for you.  And that goes without mentioning that half the internet is built around encryption.  E-commerce would not be possible without it.
It's so engrained in modern society, it's like blaming cars for the attack because terrorists can use them.  We should probably ban dihydrogen monoxide too because it fuels terrorists.

I'm a programmer myself, and this is a pretty cool implementation in python here.    
I wouldn't trust my own implementation either, but mostly because of my lack of familiarity with random number generators.  I'm not quite sure I'd trust the above implementation, but I think the existing libraries would be hard to erase from the internet, especially since so many people see their importance.  So the effort behind that $200 would look a little more like this

Have you tried withdrawing in BTC and using another service (coinbase maybe or escrow?) to convert it to another currency?  I've read about a lot of people with the same issue in the past hour =/ and that seems to be the only solution that I've found.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:39:31
thank you for you're insanely fast response, haha.  I guess i'll just buy locally for now.
