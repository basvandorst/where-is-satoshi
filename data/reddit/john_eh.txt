The two are not mutually exclusive.  Everyone is correct!

This should be part of our energy management plan already.  Ways to save some of the excess energy generated.

Equally a great idea.  Any sort of energy storage works for me.  Let's build a giant flywheel! :)

Compared to the cost of dumping electricity, yes.  Even if we pumped water uphill and used it to turn turbines on the way back down...  some sort of energy storage makes sense.

I have never understood why we don't use this extra energy to create hydrogen from water.  It is not an efficient process, but we can convert the extra electricity into a form that can be stored, and then used to run generators at a later time.

If it costs money to get rid of electricity.. and someone sets up a way to take it for free, how is paying to get rid of it cheaper?  Assuming the infrastructure costs were covered by whoever is getting the power for free?  Consider those rhetorical.
