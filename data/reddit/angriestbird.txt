Well, I probably wouldn't have yelled unless I was angry, which I wasn't - I was confused. Looking back, I would have tried to get away with more, not necessarily bad stuff - but as a kid there really are no permanent repercussions unless you do something super bad. Still, I find it strange kids get all this busy work instead of any real work, as if they're too stupid for it, which they are not.
@_date: 2014-09-30 06:34:14
I think that makes sense. Increasing the velocity should create downwards pressure on the price, so a slower rollout might be good for Bitcoin. Just my guess.
@_date: 2014-01-06 01:14:56
Just thought this would add to the discussion: 
Bitcoin is a platform, a decentralized ledger, and a currency. Yes its true that you can't currently make purchases at the supermarket with bitcoin, but currencies that are rarely used are still currencies, and bitcoin is a currency with a unique trait: it is programmable and updatable.
Personal IPOs, truly personal banking, (almost) direct support, legal services without a lawyer, self enforcing contracts, copyright proofs, remittances, non reversibility are all advantages over traditional credit or money.
I'm not going to cover some of the other common arguments against bitcoin, they have been addressed in various FAQs.
@_date: 2014-09-19 22:48:36
You're the one deciding who you socially accept.

Bitcoin is an experiment. There is no historical precedent for where the goal post should be set. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 13:49:36
No need for that tone. Very small government would still be a different definition of government. 
17 trillion is only 49k individual cost assuming 350 million people. That's about a grand a year over 50 years. Possible. 
I never officially took any libertarian stance. Simply argued that roads are so essential people will likely make them happen no matter the system.

@_date: 2014-10-03 14:10:09
I'm following the situation, it is complex. One of the reasons they might want more democracy, some seem to have implied, is because of growing inequality. 
There are reports that there is not a true free market in HK. Also, they pretty much hate the guy in charge in Hong Kong.
On the surface, they are clearly asking for universal suffrage, which mainland China supposedly already agreed to previously when Hong Kong was returned.
There are rumors that the China is affiliated with people that are starting fights, so that the cops could break up the fights, and therefore the crowds, without looking bad.
Some of the rhetoric that mainland China's govt reportedly uses is just obnoxious in my opinion. They are so concerned about "authority" and no mention of ethics.
@_date: 2014-08-22 20:49:35
I still think it's true to say bitcoin empowers the end users more so than traditional currencies.

It would be important to know the details of why they laughed at you... Are they mean girls, were you funny, did you tell them in a relatable way, and so on. 
Your point about one person getting it is a great counter to your question of why should we? I think analyst simply means to make effort, not to make effort for those who don't care.

Don't understand what exactly your point is. Or where you got the 17.16 figure. 
If all the govt did was basic stuff like build the roads it wouldn't be govt as we know it.
And I still think roads are so essential, people are going to pay for them no matter what.

Just talk to them about it in a non chalant way.
It is a bit of a stereotype but there is no rule tech nerds can't have social skills - acquaintances or friends that are women, or those who are unlike you. You might have to explain simple precautions like 2fa and using a secondary wallet, but women are interested in money.
The only problem is tech geeks might not be interested in women as acquaintances or friends. But It's definitely possible. And I'm not saying that's bad but there is something good to be said about someone who could navigate the geek and non geek worlds.

I'm simply arguing that people need roads so much they'd likely make them happen regardless, so the roads are going to get made.
Would the free rider problem be especially bad and specifically how bad? I don't necessarily have a huge issue with non payers as long as everything functions. Personally I don't have a problem with charging people either, but making a strong state can't possibly be the only way with all the tech we have.

Metcalfe's law - a network becomes more useful when there are more users. There are a lot of people and not a lot of bitcoin, so it is hard to say where that supply/demand curve actually goes into bubble territory. 
There are other cryptos, but only the ones with unique use cases that are marketed well will be successful.

A room full of them
Bitcoin has bear markets but I remain bullish long term
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:12:52
I’m broke. I’ve got nothing to lose. That’s the appeal of a non-perfect but essentially stateless deflationary currency. It’s great if you done well for yourself but it sounds like that’s why you don’t get the apparent function of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:54:52
No need for that tone, we can have a civilized disagreement. I just see no clear line of reasoning for why bitcoin won't work for at least a good while.
A lot of fiat currencies also go to zero, but that doesn't mean it wasn't very useful in the meantime. 
Edit: I do see boom-bust cycles in bitcoin, but any functional deflationary currency has an obvious use case.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:47:38
There are boom-bust cycles but what I take issue with is that you think it is a fad. Bitcoin and related technologies have huge utility value. Just because you or your direct network doesn’t benefit from the utility doesn’t mean it isn’t there. Some version of smart money will exist because it is like the internet vs books.
Not sure what your experience has to do with this. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are an unprecedented experiment.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:44:57
I'm baffled by this calculation, just because it goes up and down doesn't mean there is 99.99% chance of failure
edit: also, if there was a 47% chance of turning a cheap car into a retirement, I would argue this is a perfectly rational risk if you can afford to lose the car (and especially if you are very young). People go to colleges with ~50% graduation rates all the time
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:20:55
The difference is that people are discovering it, and that there are actual use cases for it. It seems like you have your mind made up so I can demonstrate it fundamentally works but that wouldn’t matter to you. I mean, i wish there was a friendly way to say you’re wrong.
To put it another way, just because there is a speculative element to bitcoin, doesn’t mean it isn’t actually a deflationary currency. 
Again, it sounds like you have your mind made up so I’m shutting off notifications
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:28:30
A lot of people would still be up if they lose 90% which is hilarious
I do think you’re underestimating the chances that people would eventually strongly hold a digital asset (until they have a large purchase they would like to make) and eventually creating price stability. For average people out this use case is extremely important
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:14:18

Casinos are built expressly with a purpose, to merely entertain customers and mathematically favor the house. Bitcoin is not a casino just because there is risk. It is not designed to be a Casino. It is designed to be Bitcoin. Not all risks are the same
People keep trying to compare bitcoin to other things, because when something is not like other things, people's brains get scrambled, and that makes them uncomfortable. There's some similarity here and there, but it is a non-correlated asset class.

@_date: 2017-09-18 20:16:54
The dotcom comparison doesn't work here for a few reasons.
1. Unlike the companies in the dotcom bubble, bitcoin already exists and functions.
2. The dotcom bubble was caused by speculation but not adoption. Cryptocurrencies are experiencing actual adoption. Also, crypto doesn't have nearly as much money in it as the dotcom bubble.
3. There are already other technically superior coins but bitcoin has not been wiped out because of metcalfe's law, and because it only needs to compete with savings/gold, not every economic function.
There's still some amount of risk in bitcoin but it only needs to be good enough to suceed at this point. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 20:30:50
I agree there is some risk but it is still an exaggeration by the order of many magnitudes to compare it to the dotcom bubble.
As a deflationary currency, as long as it stays just good enough, bitcoin will deflate over time.
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:22:59
That perspective is bs.
Bitcoin is the gateway for the entire crypto ecosystem and all of the innovation that comes with it.
It’s also different in the sense that, you’re not seeking profits. You don’t need huge capital to get started in bitcoin.
I’m not against owning real estate and renting it out. But unrestrained capitalism is like the late stage if a monopoly game; a few people control the board and it is not a lot of fun for the rest.
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:02:04
There might be valid reasons for a stable inflationary currency. Whether or not that means government issued fiat is another debate.
But there already is a soft war, there is nothing sneaky about it. Some people are in it for political reasons, some people are in it for the money, some people are in it for technological progress.

I’m confused about what would happen if you withdraw your bitcoin to a hardware wallet like a trezor before the fork. Where would the new forked coin come from and how would you put it into your wallet?

Though his point is technically true, the survivorship bias argument is sometimes used to give a pessimistic spin. Which could be a self fulfilling prophecy.
Innovation is not a lottery ticket
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:57:45
The problem with calling something just survivorship bias is that there’s no analysis at all if something is likely to to survive. So there’s no proof it isn’t likely to survive either.
Citing all these other cases that failed doesn’t lead to any useful estimate of bitcoin succeeding either.
Ultimately it is just an opinion, no one knows exactly what will happen. Hold bitcoin if you like it, don’t if you don’t. 
You can definitely make an argument that a hedge against governments and central policies has value as long as governments occasionally fail.

Some questions:
Do you see the gov't being able to tax bitcoins, and will they do it soon?
I know what the worst possible scenario is, but in the best possible scenario, will bitcoin grow exponentially? In the best possible scenario, how much would it be worth at end of 2013, mid 2014, end of 2014?
Assuming bit coin succeeds, at what price and point in time do you see bitcoin reaching "stability"?
Is it even possible for governments to shut down bit coin if they really wanted to?
Are there any alternative crypto currencies that might become the standard instead of bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:05:39
Sounds sensationalist. The browser has always been open on apple products, that's the point.
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:50:24
Apple does have a more open system - the web browser.
I've actually mentioned several times to friends that I wanted all versions of android be exactly the same. Their response? Then it wouldn't be android. And they have a point. 
By having a ton of apps that reveal permissions and warnings in the App Store, this would add a level of complication that is not like apple. Apple has been this way since the beginning - the agreement is that you give up options and control over details for simplicity. You don't seem to want what apple is offering. And to that is say, great, go with something else.
I actually like android by the way. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:04:51

@_date: 2013-12-07 20:09:55
This is so confusing. So what it's saying is that if china defined it as a currency that means that they will regulate it, therefore not allowing it. But they are allowing it, because they defined it as not a currency.
So why exactly did bitcoin crash? Does this mean that two chinese could trade bitcoins as direct payment without the government looking down on this interaction?

There is a privacy policy on many apps. But I think you mean privacy, not security. I don't think most android users read permissions. 
But this is also exactly what I don't want - to have to consider permissions each time. Just because someone prefers to go to a restaurant instead of cook their own food - doesn't mean they should be super concerned as to what's exactly in their sandwich.
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:12:55
Not exactly. 
Google is not entirely open and apple is not entirely closed. 
Giving up something for something is not slavery. People voluntarily give up control over many details for a simple computing environment. 
The free market has other solutions that work well enough. But some people like trading options for simplicity. It's no where as crazy as working for free your entire life.
@_date: 2013-11-26 08:58:14
I wonder if black people ever get tired of this and reverse the terminology. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:35:42
I'm a bit of a newbie. Isn't it possible to compare bitcoin's deflation to the USD inflation? Is that relevant to what you've mentioned? 
Yes, there are little protections at the moment, but I do see that it is possible for the government to regulate some rules around how companies related to bitcoin on US soil operate, even if they can not regulate bitcoin directly. I hope there is some company to back bitcoin like the FDIC backs USD.

Wouldn't it make sense to withdraw bitcoins after the price stabilizes and invest in low risk mutual funds or something like that? 
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:10:22
I don't think it is just a fad, even if it is not the currency that will have sustained success. You're right, there is some hype and excitement about it. But I do think merchants want that 3%. I do think bit pay or other services could solve the volatility problem.
I think the potential is genuinely there for bitcoin to be a big deal, because it is a technological platform, not just a currency:
I'm not saying it will become a big deal. I don't know that for a fact. But if I were to guess what people would use 100 years from now - I can't imagine them using paper money.
People also used to think that computers were nerd boxes with no application for the average person. That's because they didn't realize it's a platform with many applications, not just a nerd box.
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:38:30
so it would be pretty apparent to the miners? wish this technical answer was given in the original post.
@_date: 2013-11-22 10:29:21
Got it. Yes, that's the idea, to model it as if it would grow exponentially indefinitely, just for the sake of interesting speculation. We can also look back and compare the speculation with reality.
The real question is if 1% or 10%+ of the world is going to adopt bitcoin. But, I think there is enough data points to draw a line in the data and say that is the trajectory, even if it is purely speculation. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:42:39
So I'm trying to understand your objections... Is it mainly because you belong to the "regulation is necessary" school of thought?

You had practice on eve online? I am afraid of you.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:49:00
Here is why I disagree.
It's spoon feeding to you, it's simplicity to everyone who likes ios. I would rather trust the native flashlight app than to wonder why all these permissions are necessary, and having to email the developer to ask. 
It's "only" about 20% market share to you, it's the most complete ecosystem with the most/best apps to everyone else. Without counting the low end android devices, apple is doing fine in terms of market share, and more importantly, customer satisfaction. If any other company had 20% of market share that would be great.
We don't know exactly what apple will do with bitcoin yet, but so far the 5s is arguably one of the most ideal devices for mobile payments because of its fingerprint scanner.
Just because you prefer options over simplicity does not mean 100% of everybody should.

In our currently reality bitcoin is winning this race. While it is plausible that people might accept a government backed crypto this isn't evidence that decentralized would necessarily fail.

Its not calling it what I like. No one really knows what apple will do long term.  I do not currently trust any phone app with bitcoins as a payment device. Well, not with any large sum if bitcoin.
Also, the browser is open on apple devices. Only the App Store is closed. It has always been this way. Edit: yes I acknowledge they're shutting down bitcoin apps. But this is no surprise.

I don't know if bitcoin is having a bubble or faster than usual growth - but it is above what the logarithmic chart would suggest.
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:14:01
But wouldn't the decentralized nature of bitcoin prevent currency warfare in the first place, especially when the market is saturated?
Wouldn't eventual market saturation decrease volatility? How do we measure how much volatility people will accept? Isn't it rational to accept volatility for the benefits of deflation?
My objection is that they are applying the reasoning of centralized fiat currencies to decentralized crypto - and drawing conclusions. I don't know what will happen either, but I don't see how a definitive conclusion could be made - without waiting first for the results of this experiment to come through.


Btw this is just false bitcoins are not saturated enough for people to not spend significant amounts. And once it is it should stabilize. This also assumes a consumerist society is good.

I suppose you have a point about it being anti competitive and open source having some security benefits, but ad hominems are not cool. However, it doesn't seem like flash is winning on android devices either.
I don't know the technical details of the flash issue, but I've never had a problem getting the function I want either through the open browser or the closed App Store. 
Point is, the browser on apple products accesses content just fine. Saying that apple is losing against innovation in this case when it still has a lead in the App Store and have been promoting the HTML5 standard is plainly wrong. This is probably why they kept the browser open and promoted html5. Or else they would close it down, and they haven't for years.
I've always liked aols content. As long as they offered high speed broadband and allowed people out they would have probably been fine.
I do agree some of apples actions are anti competitive, but I can't find any major tech company that hasn't taken an anti competitive action.

I don't know what the net is in terms of jobs...but I think the trend is inevitable: one day we will not need to work due to technology and machines. People will have to deal with this one way or another. 
As for raising capital through a bitcoin based platform, I don't see this as necessarily for just "random" people. It could be professional investors.
As for common people, yes, I think a platform built on bitcoin could empower them to make lending / investing decisions. It lowers the barrier to entry (as is the trend in history), and this is admittedly purely speculative - but I think the average financial IQ will go up with practice. Besides, you can program conditions into the app - if people don't agree that you've completed by a certain date, the app wouldn't release the bitcoins.
History so far has trended towards decentralizing power from monarchs to everyone else. The average person has google, and historically the average king didn't even have that. I think this decentralization is a net positive on the whole.

I agree they need to allow coinbase but calling iphone just a status symbol instead of functional is plain incorrect.
What some people don't understand is that iphone users pay apple to curate the App Store - we're not being controlled anymore than a hotel user is controlled because they could not redecorate. I'm not saying apple is right about disallowing coinbase, but the real reason it doesn't bother me is that - the browser has open access.

1 btc and ounce of gold are arbitrary quantities. It's really about the total value of gold vs total value of bitcoin. 
One of the more interesting evaluations is that if bitcoin achieves 1-10% of the forex market, thats $100,000 to 1,000,000 per bitcoin. Don't remember the source.
There's also talk about bitcoin competing with paypal, other phone payment services, credit cards, lawyers.
But this is getting ahead, it will be interesting to see what happens in the next two years. There has been a decimal place added per year so far.
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:06:46
probably lots of answers by now but:
1. it doesn't matter if the savings are not passed down to the consumer. its still passed down to the merchant, therefore an incentive for adoption.
2. bitcoin also competes with banks, gold, paypal, its not just a currency. Otherwise, we will have to wait and see.
3. there is a network effect going on so no one is just going to jump ship. it is only likely that people will jump ship if the new currency allows wealth transfer. yes, competing currencies might take over, but bitcoin as of now, is in the lead by far. the problem with institution backed crypto is that you have to trust the central institution. bitcoin was developed to be decentralized, so that you don't have to trust people, just  computer science.
4. I think people have answered the "real value" question. As far as people have always accepted gold, yes, people might always accept gold. But you know what the trend is in the last 30 years? People accept technology and computer science. People might not always accept bitcoin, but they might accept it because of network effect. If a lot of people are using it, they will accept it. Or they might accept it, as in Richard Branson's case, because he thinks the technology is useful.
Yes another currency could take over. But apparently in our version of reality, windows is common on desktops, android and iOS on tablets, and bitcoin is in the lead in terms of crypto. Maybe in another parallel universe blackberry is winning. But that simply isn't our reality as of now. Bitcoin is currently winning. If bitcoin is widely adopted, it will stay popular for a while unless it has serious technical issues.
What I am concerned about, is how safe is coinbase.com really? is it as safe as reputable banking sites? Can we trust these institutions built around bitcoin?

I'm an apple user and am okay with apple taking this route. They are conservative and wait it out, and implement solutions usually when they think they are ready. I don't see this as anti bitcoin, it's simply the nature of a closed app platform. But what you don't realize is that the browser has always been basically open on an apple device. It's not entirely closed.
If you don't trust apple to make correct decisions long term, then I agree you should switch. But so far, some of the best apps and bitcoin related apps like bitcoin101 were iOS only last time I checked. You also give up the advantages of a closed system if you reject it for its disadvantages.

This is just a question, and I'm not sure, but isn't history not controlled by policy makers as much as trends? 
I think whats missing from this discussion is that unlike banks, you can have a bitcoin address with 5 dollars in it and not get charged with bank fees. So the unbanked could get banking and possibly start businesses. You could have software allowing you to announce a project, and allowing backers to send their BTC directly. A 6 year old could have a lemonade stand and raise the necessary capital through an IPO all through an app.

If a government backed it's own version of crypto, then it's not open source. Who knows how they are going to change the code? Will Americans trust Chinese crypto and vice versa? I'm not sure of all the implications. 
I think people will trust technology and not people. A centralized currency depends on trust in the judgment and stability of a single government or institution.

- Suggesting that i'm funding bad deals? No need for ad hominem arguments. I am presuming that deflation is better than stability, with companies like bit pay converting to USD or whatever currency at the point of sale.
- You're making claims here but not explaining why. I've heard the deflationary spiral arguments, and some people who are pro-bitcoin even agree that deflation might be a real issue. But so far it doesn't seem to be an issue. Yes, bitcoin is experimental and I don't think there has been a spendable decentralized deflationary peer to peer currency before. You can't easily give gold flakes as payment. I take the position that more data will be necessary, it could be a real problem, but so far it does look okay.
- You suggested that saying there is some safety in bitcoin was similar to saying obama might be an alien lizard. I'm not saying you claim that obama is an alien lizard, only that those two claims were on the same level of evidence as bitcoin having some safety features. They are not, even if my thought experiment is wrong. This time you gave more specific reasons. These "crises" are not "crises" because bitcoin is not a primary currency. 
- Be specific as to what rudimentary economics knowledge I am missing. I think what you mean by this is that "You are wrong to disagree and think that deflationary currencies could work". I am definitely saying that the experiment of bitcoin, in my opinion, has merit even if it is untraditional. I'm not saying I am certain it will work. Edit: we might have a situation where bitcoin works as a currency, with the definition of "work" not being correlated to a traditional currency.
- As for the practical chances of having a deposit seized, that is irrelevant here because in order to support the thought experiment that bitcoin has some safety benefits, I don't need to prove that these issues are common personally. Historically gold is seized, fiat fails and this did affect the course of history. There are real risks to bitcoin too, I acknowledge its an ongoing experiment. But the point of this was to point out there might be reasons that bitcoin's system is safer. I'm not saying I know the future. Edit: It could be possible that people in the future prefer crypto, if only for the fact that paper money could carry germs from other people. 
- I still think that decentralizing power is another aspect that's possibly safer, and is generally a positive trend throughout history.

I'm not certain, so these are all questions:
- There is a way of interfering once a crash happens, it just has to be done not by the government? technically the government could still buy into bitcoin literally to prop the system up or sell off their stash. Or anyone with means.
- Wouldn't people want to trade stability for a currency designed to deflate over time? And doesn't the evidence show that people actually spend a bit when their stash grows?
- The technology adoption cycle solves this problem. The less risk adverse members of society and early adopters could put a little in. The geeks come first, then the businesses, then most people?
- Bitcoin might be a bit like the discovery of fire. It puts more power into the hands of more people. The average caveman could start a fire. I'm not sure what amount of government could actually stop that? It's a decentralized system. 
- What if bitcoin was actually *low* risk, but we can not verify this until a point much further in history? I know, this is pure speculation, and no one should take this as advice, but thought experiments have value.

- People like the winklevosses and richard branson do invest large sums into BTC, so the evidence is on the contrary. A million isn't that big of a deal to some people or groups.
- Please be specific as to why you would print more bitcoins. 
- There is 5 years of data showing that bitcoin crashes tend to recover. I'm not saying there is more, there isn't, but 5 years of data is still some evidence. Edit: A counter point might be that it's speculation. Yes, some of it probably is, but no one knows the long term percentage of "real" users, and buying more bitcoins is still a way of interfering a crash.
- How could the short answer be no? The evidence points towards some people voting yes, some people watching cautiously, and some people voting no. So obviously at best the most you can claim is some people vote no. I know the counter argument is that it's only geeks so far, but often geeks are a good sign for something.
- Within context, the point was that more people have the option of a semi anonymous decentralized peer to peer currency, which they didn't before. Bitcoin as a platform could give banking to those who only have small amounts, and fee less banking for the not rich is a revolutionary concept. I'm not going into what else could be done with bitcoin as a platform beyond save people 3-4% on fees - there are some good videos on this on youtube. No one knows exactly what the % efficiency is, but I think you're missing all the implications of the technology if you think its only 3-4%, and i've given a specific example.
- Except that there are 5 years of data points for Bitcoin and 0 for those other claims. On top of that, gold could be seized, paper money could be burned or stolen. Centralized currencies sometimes disappear with the country. Bitcoin at least has two factor authentication and could easily survive if a country doesn't. There is some evidence so far that bitcoin is safe in some ways. Again this isn't investment advice, but either bitcoin has some safety advantages or it doesn't, and there is. 
- Edit: Another example that suggests a decentralized digital currency might be safer is from the decentralization of governments. Having a centralized seat of power (a King) is a risk because you could have a bad leader that can't lose their job, and because of the corrupting influence of power. With a decentralized government like a republic, there are checks and balances.

Once we have quantum computers that could break the codes, i'm sure the quantum computers could also make more complicated codes.
That and as a side effect of having so much computing power we'd be living in the matrix by that time, entire worlds we could change with just our minds. 
I got carried away there.

Why specifically can't it scale globally?

But gold isn't always actually used for industrial or fashion purposes. It's used as a store of value, and most of its value is because its useful as a store of value! And bitcoin also has that property (presuming no major technical problems), but you don't need forts or guns to protect bitcoin. Also, you can't shave of a piece of gold and pay for your coffee, but you can with bitcoin. 
Though bubbles could happen, could you be specific how you calculated 90%? Let's suppose you understood you are using bitcoin as a store of value, because you don't want to store too much money as cash, which loses value slowly. 
Then if people understood they were using bitcoin as a store of value, why would enough people pump and dump bitcoin all at once? Don't they have a vested interest in keeping bitcoin somewhat stable after it has reached market saturation? And wouldn't market saturation prevent a 90% fall?
An example is facebook. Unless something was really wrong with it, why would 90% of users leave it? It's useful as a store of social possibilities.
