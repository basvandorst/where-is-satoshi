I have no idea what I'm mining.

I think the reason this confuses people is this:
1. Intangible numbers are generally "unit less", like in any general mathematical graph for example, a coordinate of (1,0) on the x axis - is that 1 meter? 1 foot? 1 mile? 1 centimeter? It only matters when you need it to matter.
2. The currency itself (in a way) exists outside of the monetary system they use natively (and fluctuates when you try to equate it.) So it's hard to tie the value down to something tangible in this sense too.
So I don't disagree with you, but I see where the confusion might be.
You might use the example "well, you split one cookie in half and it's not two cookies!" Which is a great example, but doesn't solve the true tangibility issue for bitcoin. Even if you say this, it's hard for people to come up with the tangibility value for btc--
They go down the path: "How many cookies is one btc worth? Well if we don't know or if it's fluctuated between .001 cookies and 10,000 cookies so easily in the past, can't we just arbitrarily split the value of btc and make that 'one cookie'?"

There are times that we get suckered in,
By bitcoin, and memes, and comments on reddit
But it's when we do these things too much,
That we've lost control, and must get...

They *kind of* got close to doing this with the pinewood derby episode when they found all the "Space Cash" and started spending it on random things.

I'm not a historian or anything, but here goes. Two spaces after a period was a common way to separate sentences back in the typewriter days.
At some point in history it was standardized as APA or MLA style, and back in the day these style format handbooks were common references for journalists, authors, and scholars.
I think it all originates from plate-based "movable type" from the early days of the printing press.
Now on why Satoshi would use this? Perhaps the style was hard-wired into him, suggesting that he may be older, or just really likes the style.

Instead of "do-over," shouldn't he be asking for like 30 confirmations or a chance to fork his conviction if he doesn't agree?
