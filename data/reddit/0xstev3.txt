I at no point claimed it did. You keep doing this - I point out that the govt doesn't care about you selling your old shit on eBay and you ask me if I'm admitting to "tax fraud". I'm wondering what your motivation is for this faggotory...
@_date: 2014-01-04 10:35:26
... because if you do there's no reason you can't keep that 75,000!

@_date: 2014-12-19 14:01:48
Probably because they don't tax you on the odd ebay sale you make

Who's to say you wont scam people too? Absolutely nothing as far as I can see.
Hows your market going btw? I remember you from the ancap thread and then I saw a vice article on your site, so you're ingrained in my memory :) Maybe it was because of the name you gave your market, but it does seem rather suspicious that vice did an article on you when you basically had a bare-bones website. The fact you said you were an ancap is the only reason I have to trust you, and that's a terrible reason, really.

Not necessarily physical harm.


Do you keep doing that in hopes of annoying me or something lol?
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:31:07


You mean the biggest gang of thugs in the area gets to decide and force it onto everyone who's near and isn't already being controlled by different gang?


I would say the other side don't. For instance I would say that enforcing a minimum wage *sounds* great, but isn't at all. Or *helping our children get a head start in life* by guaranteeing college loans, which actually just plunge them into huge debt and often leave them with useless, unneeded degrees isn't great either. People's response to these criticisms are usually "do you want the poor working for slave wages!?" or "people deserve a head start in life!", which sound compassionate and all, but not exactly helpful to the affected people.


I hope they do! I think social ostracism is a magnificent, non-violent way of getting people to conform.


I think there are more than a few, and once people don't assume the problem is being fixed by govt, I think they'll be more interested in helping. If there aren't more than a few, then how can we expect those to end up in government positions where they can force the bad folk to pay up? I think we love to help others; I don't know the figures, but I'm sure a crazy amount of money was donated to Japan/Pakistan during their last disaster. Perhaps it's not a valid comparison, but New Orleans didn't do so well after hurricane Katrina when people thought govt would take care of it.
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:43:05
I'm sorry, but I'm not buying this murderer-for-hire part at all.
First of all, DPR was apparently all about non-aggression. Secondly how did this **bitcoin-funded** assassin plan on tracking him down? 


Oh, so he just sent $150,000 to someone he'd never worked with before without escrow? And boom, just like that, this victim was identified? LOL nigga please.


BE AFRAID! WE'RE FORCING YOU TO STICK WITH THE DOLLAR BECAUSE WE CARE ABOUT YOU!
edit: Okay, I've since read the court pics and I encourage you to do the same. It sounds fucking ridiculously fake...
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:47:48


Relax, bro. Blackmail typically isn't seen as aggression in voluntarism, but I guess if it leads to the cops attacking innocents, it might be valid self-defence on their behalf.
@_date: 2013-04-24 19:58:17


If someone can come forward with a better claim on the land, then I would say it is theirs.


Could you better explain what you mean please?
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:03:03
Yeah. If someone were threatening to put people's lives in danger in the way of getting thugs to attack them, I see that as self-defence...
@_date: 2013-04-25 15:07:42


So basically if everybody already homesteaded the land and nobody wants you on it then you don't own yourself? I'm not sure I see why that's the case; I get that you have nowhere to go, but I don't see that somehow means you don't own yourself. If that denies ownership of you, then who owns you?
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:17:36
Could you give us some info about him?
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:17:53


no... that's not what happened...
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:51:58
and then what happened?
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:51:59


I'd probably agree. I'd like to see people left alone to see what voluntarism could produce.


I can understand if there were no welfare, but there is, so I'm not sure why governments don't just give people who earn under $x/hour whatever they would if they were out of work. Instead they're told they're not allowed to work for less than they deem adequate, which ruins any chance of non-cash benefits that might come with a job such as training.


I'm in England and University (equivalent of college in the US) isn't that cheap; it's typically £9000/year. I'm fairly sure if government got out of the way, a free market could lower that price significantly, or provide better alternatives.


Well, it sucks that they're heartless for whatever reason, but I want a non-violent society and I'm not about to attack them for not doing something for me.

Well, I'm unsure if kidnapping goes against self-ownership. If you were to steal my car, it wouldn't mean the car now doesn't belong to me, etc.


As before, I don't think so, but it wouldn't be a legitimate claim to property if you're basically trapping me in a spot. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:56:18


You don't *pay taxes*; Money is taken from you through violent threats...
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:19:13
They're the best I've come across so far. Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-04-06 17:17:08
Probably because of stress...
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:41:35


I'm not sure how that invalidates self-ownership.


In what way is people's ownership of themselves contingent on others?
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:14:33


So basically if they own no land, they don't own their own bodies?


Nope? Just a self. That would mean that children don't have self-ownership, no? As few of us own land when we're children.

@_date: 2013-10-02 17:33:09


And how would they do that? Even ignoring possible additions to his message history, how on earth do they do that? It's kinda impossible, they just have to persuade the jury.
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:06:48


Well I'm one of those depending on what you class as benefits. I of course leave my house every once in a while, so I use the pavements. If they want welfare and don't want to pay tax, then yeah, they need to rethink that.


Meh, debatable - I don't think schools would resemble anything close to what the government has them be, I'm pretty sure there wouldn't be a drug war, or regular war to pay for, and there would be competition tied with easy-entry to the market keeping prices low for other services.
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:09:27


@_date: 2013-10-02 17:21:52


And how on earth do you argue the evidence? The FBI could just add in message entries and you'd have no way of knowing... It's like having a cop plant cocaine on you, only without the dash cam.
Again, why WOULD you trust the US govt? Have they given you good reason to? Ever?
