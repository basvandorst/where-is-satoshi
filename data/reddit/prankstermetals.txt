The problem with this is the cost per unit (the price of the note + holographic sticker). 
@_date: 2016-03-24 22:15:06
Of course, but we both know something like that would social suicide and probably jail for fraud. 
Not really wishing that on us. 
@_date: 2016-03-20 15:19:01
I was thinking the general goal to be idea generation and concepts that might work to make BTC stronger. 
So disucssing things like: 
Interesting startups that are on peoples radar
Technologies that could work with BTC 
Stuff that you are working on
etc, etc.
@_date: 2016-03-25 10:36:56
I'm glad to hear that! 
Yeah I know that we have a lot of work ahead of us to combat these problems. For know, I think it's best we call them cold storage so when you trade, the other person simply removes the QR and scans it in.
Ofcourse that wasn't the idea but we'll get there! 
And counterfeiting, you have no idea how much effort we've been putting into combatting an issue that dosent even exist for this concept yet. 
The thing is, we have proper security software to our disposal and have riddled the actual note with tons of security features, some that aren't even shown on the pictures I put up (kinda on purpose). 
The fact that the note will be in polymer is another good security feature, these are not normal cotton Banknotes :) 
@_date: 2016-03-20 15:19:53
Yeah that could work, problem is that I'm back in england before the 6th. 
@_date: 2016-03-25 11:39:43
We'd love to design and print banknotes that would work for Liberland. Can you get me in touch with Vít Jedlička? 
It would be a fun collaboration to create small denomination banknotes bearing your flag that can be actually used for trade. 
@_date: 2016-03-20 14:43:27
Wonderful, maybe we can organise a meet in a pub or cafe? 
@_date: 2016-03-26 14:19:55
Well we listened to the community and found that people want a DYI version. 
So we are creating a version where you print your QRs at home. 
@_date: 2016-03-25 00:08:51
Not the stickers we're putting on this note, It will be a private reel. 
@_date: 2016-03-25 01:06:07
Thank you. But I have to say, I actually appreciate being challenged. It makes sure I know what I'm talking about and that I didn't envision something without thinking it through. 
So don't hesitate to be sceptical every step of the way, we will work double time to surprise you :) 
@_date: 2016-03-25 15:36:27
I'll talk to my team and see what to do. 
Also yes, I can confirm he is one of them. 
@_date: 2016-03-25 22:10:05
We have an update for you. We are issuing DIY notes. Its only fair. 
Now you can print and load the private/public QR at home. 
@_date: 2016-03-24 21:41:46
We've thought about how we could tackle this; 
From keeping strict procudures in how we print the QRs, to using offline linux computers it makes the process safer. 
@_date: 2016-03-25 14:15:46
For now, the main idea is to create cold storage. 
As we implement better security features, work with various NGO's, and reduce the cost of production- it will be possible for us to create notes fully supported for circulation. 
We've just started. 
@_date: 2016-03-21 00:50:41
Wouldn't that lead to 2 hours of no productivity :P
@_date: 2016-03-10 23:36:58
I should've posted the album. That's exactly the plan. Public QR on top of a tamper evident sticker that houses the private QR under it. 
The plan is also to work with a trusted Bitcoin exchange and they load the QRs with the allotted amount. 
 
Shows both the front and the back of the concepts. 
@_date: 2016-03-25 01:01:01
Well for one, one of the core concepts is for me to NOT have these keys available to me or the company. After all, I don't have 5 years experience in selling bitcoin. I also don't have hundreds of satisfied customers. Simply put, I'm new un-proven meat.
We're actually in talks with already trusted and established bitcoin retailers to create, load and print the QRs on the notes, put that tamper evident sticker and sell them. There are stringent procedures we ask from them.
In the minute chance that a customer gets a compromised key, then the company we partnered with are obligated to refund with their own money. 
It's both their and our reputation on the line. So any slips like that would hurt, not worth it. 
I see this as a win-win for all parties, you will rest assured that a new startup doesn't have access to the actual coins, but we in turn know both us and the already trusted companies we partner with will see more sales due to increasd trust. 
Do I have a new customer? ;) 
@_date: 2016-03-21 00:40:09
I was very careful not to say coffeeshop to insure that wouldn't be mistaken as the case... 
@_date: 2016-03-25 13:27:37
This is like a paper wallet. The bitcoin is stored on the actual note. 
@_date: 2016-03-25 01:39:48
Funny you say that, they are actually based from my home town (Baar, Switzerland)!
And yes, I've spoken to them not long ago. I'll go meet them when I'm back in ZG. 
@_date: 2016-03-25 08:55:15
That is the plan, but I fist need to introduce it to the world. Otherwise I won't have much luck. Atleast people like it!
@_date: 2016-03-10 21:04:12
There was a minor mixup, we used an older template for an earlier concept. As amended above. 
Regards, 
@_date: 2016-03-25 14:39:49
Thank you for bringing up these good points. 
For now, we are defenitely calling this a proof of concept. I wouldn't trust my self to make anything truly bullet proof with 2000 USD. However,  I can still try to push the envelope. 
I'm happy to give my real wold identity for this project, might even ask for Estonian E-Citizenship. I'll need to read how to sign them, but I'm 100% okay with this. 
@_date: 2016-03-21 00:51:49
I put Amsterdam because it's probable that there will be more people willing to meet. I'm near The Hague so Utrecht isn't a problem to get to either. 
@_date: 2016-03-25 09:04:43
Hello u/Jdamb! 
We will be starting a kickstarter soon. But if in the future you want these 0.10 BTC notes, it will be possible to buy them via the already trusted exchanges we partnered with. Most likely some will be sold on eBay because they offer customers a money back guarantee (that naturally would be taken from our account if there is a problem). 
Also great idea to offer a bounty, only problem is we don't have 4k :(
@_date: 2016-03-25 00:29:36
Yeah I'm trying to learn how to do that. I'm even planning on buying a drawing tablet. 
The good news is that if this project is successful, I can always use some of the earnings to hire people to help me make the engravings. 
Already know how much it would cost per portrait and all. 
@_date: 2016-03-10 20:16:07
Thank you for letting us know! From an earlier post on it was suggested that the notes would need to contain cold storage bitcoins to be trusted. 
We used an older template and didn't update the legal text accordingly. The concept is infact cold storage notes
Corrected: 
@_date: 2016-03-24 21:32:36
These polymer banknotes have a private and public QR on them. You can void the note by removing the tamper evident sticker to get to the private QR. 
So its not fiat by any means. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 00:18:32
The public key is on top the tamper evident sticker. The private Qr is under it. The original idea was to allow for the note to remain valid along as the sticker is there. 
Of course, if people are making them at home and planning to trade them then its recommended for the next person to check both keys. 
@_date: 2016-03-24 23:18:50
Well the whole point of asking an already established crypto company to utilise a secure linux computer thats not connected to the internet to produce the private/public keys, package them with the seal and sell them under their name is to reduce the possibility of not only having that happen, but also preventing us from using that very excuse. 
Hows it's designed currently, all of us at polymerbit would never see those private QR's. We just design and print the notes. 
That's how we plan to tackle the trust issue. Having someone you know and already trust and buy from in the community to work on the sensitive part. 
We will hopefully build a good reputation evenetually to be trusted enough by our customers to make some our selves. 
But we don't desperately need to do it our selves. 
@_date: 2016-03-24 23:36:51
Yep, full steam ahead for a real banknote! We're starting with the 0.1 BTC. 
Yeah also cheers, I noticed earlier. 
Tired working on a design in the early hours of the morning= stupid mistakes. 
I've since fixed it on our actual psd and ai files. Need to update on imgur :P 
@_date: 2016-03-25 00:46:51
Originally, that was the idea. But we found that a lot of people were not happy with this. 
The core concept of bitcoin is to be decentralised. If we control when it can be redeemed, then we basically just made silver certificates again. Which were suddenly made non redeemable. 
But even so, its safer and a lot more trust worthy for the customer to actually posses the bitcoin.
Because one:
 If we are holding all the BTC on one wallet waiting for people to redeem it, then the potential for a very bad day is very possible. 
And two: 
The note is actually more useful in the real world. More vendors will accept it if they can just take the private key and get their BTC there and then. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 00:24:12


Not quite, we tried to make ours as close as possible to real notes. 
Yeah, we do! our website 
Just note we need to update the fact that we offer this option. I'll do so tomorrow morning as its quite late here. 
@_date: 2016-03-25 08:58:42
Ah are you talking about the last note? Well originally the idea was to simply make them redeemable, but people did not like that idea.
So we tweaked it. 
Problem is I took an older image and didn't notice that it was pre the fix. 
The new concept will not expire at all! :) 
@_date: 2016-06-14 18:06:41
If there is enough demand then I don't see why not. 
Could you link me to their website?
@_date: 2016-06-14 15:12:44
Here is another of series planned (not ready yet). Quite colourful indeed. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 15:08:18
We hope to have them on the market early next year :)
@_date: 2016-06-14 15:10:56
We are getting them printed now, hopefully within early next year. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 15:09:39
Soon ;)
@_date: 2016-06-14 15:07:26
Working on it :)
@_date: 2016-06-16 15:39:09
Could work, but it ruins the aesthetics of the note. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:17:34
Either that or a million zeroes... 
@_date: 2016-06-14 15:07:57
@_date: 2016-06-14 15:09:19
Yes, but listening to the advice from this community, for security reasons they will not be sold with BTC on them. 
They will sell as novelty that can hold BTC if you wish to use it as such. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 12:14:24
Yeah thats pretty much it, slow and steady wins the race. 
Its incredible how much time it takes to develop a product. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 23:07:39
Yeah we will be glad to do so in the future, and will be asking the community what we should design next. :)
@_date: 2017-01-11 01:54:59
Haha yeah that was my last verture, I tried to set up a Gallium company during my bachelor's. Got shutdown because as it turns out, you can't ship Gallium in the mail without hazmat. 
But the name just was too good to get rid of. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:18:46
Thanks! We really gave it all we could :) 
@_date: 2017-01-11 01:04:13
We might make some for that market in the future, maybe in the shape and size of the old 500 and 1000 rupee notes, but it would only be a coincidence ;) 
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:22:34
Yep! To add on, its not prefunded. For this ealy concept you make the keys at home with normal paper using our tamper evident sticker. We hope to provide something more professional on the next generation. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 15:10:35
Meh, people should never allow this practice to exist in the first place. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 15:38:44
Fair enough and that could work in the future if we're established and have proven that these notes do sell. 
Originally we were planning to sell them with BTC, but both people on here and r/btc were concerned over the risks of one startup potentially holding so many private keys. 
For now, we want to introduce the concept and see what people think of it. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:24:58
Per note, tamper evident sticker and packaging included. 
If this proves popular, we have no problem making lower deminations if our customers demand it. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:58:09
What about mbtc?
@_date: 2016-06-14 15:13:18
Thats the plan :)
@_date: 2017-01-11 03:34:24
Also I should add that all risks are clearly marked on our website and will also be displayed on the packaging and note. 
Here's basically it all boiled down: 
1) Private QRs can be compromised, the chances are small, and you can minise this further by taking steps to make it harder to capture the key. This includes using an older printer without ram and Linux running on an offline computer. 
2) This is a concept, we really don't promise much more than a nice looking polymer Banknote. It works also works as a durable cold storage paper wallet if you need it too.
3) We don't intend this note to be used in commerce, if you see this thread and others on our notes, it's pretty obvious how many issues there are to solve 
4) We also recommend that if you do decide to use this concept note as a cold storage device, please keep a backup of the private key in a secure location. 
5) For obvious reasons if the note gets lost or stolen, you will lose the coins. Minimise this risk by following 4) 
 
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:25:11
 If these prove popular, we will be printing more. There is a whole series planned from 0.1 to 1 BTC. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 23:33:51
We figured something out that could work. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 11:49:23
Not affordably yet on smaller scales, but its coming. It all depends if theres a viable market for them. The Euro notes already have RFID chips inside of them. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 01:51:14
You do, at home using your own printer. Its the safest way. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:58:56
Sorry I forgot to answer the second question We aren't doing preorders because we don't believe its a good idea if we haven't even sold any products yet. But I'll announce it through  reddit and the Bitcoin Forum when we are launching. Probably give a 24 hours till launch notice. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:27:09
You don't need glue for the private QR, the sticker acts to hold it in place. But the public one, if you wish to add it, yes. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 03:22:27
That venture going wrong turned out to be a truly constructive learning curve. 
1) I learned not to do preorders on an untested product 
2) I also learned that one step at a time is better than trying to make promises you can't keep
but most importantly;
I found that where I truly failed was bullshitting my way through it (fake it till you make it mentality) and not having the right contacts and knowledge to be able to pull through. 
Regarding SEO, I knew people could always reaserch my history, and frankly I'm okay with that. 
The notes I created contain no bitcoin or private keys and essentially are simply a product sold at face value. I know I meant well with the opaque boxes, but intentions don't mean much when it comes to producing a good product.  
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:56:39
For now, we seem to be getting a lot of attention from bitcoin fans who wanted a novelty or a paper wallet. 
So we will see where this will bring us :) 
@_date: 2017-01-12 12:22:51
Looks like I should send them a message. 
*Edit: The to them
@_date: 2017-01-11 00:28:12
Thank you, we will take that into account :)
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:55:23
Nice, but we aren't exactly in the same market as them. Our goal is to make Bitcoin feel normal to use. Just like any currency. A USB stick isnt exactly what I'd feel normal carrying around. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:16:48
These aren't preloaded, we were talking to redditors both on here and r/btc and figured at least in the foreseeable future, we will not be loading the notes. Just like u/zobraS said, promises are dangerous in this case. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:51:26
Yep, we are counting on the market to prove wether its feasible to produce them in larger quanities. When it comes to banknotes, 1000pcs is a minisule amount for a professional printer. Economies of scale should kick in when we ramp up production. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:36:15
Thank you, its been an anxious wait. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 20:05:24
They will sell on 
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:40:23
For now, the serial number on the note and on the tamper evident sticker makes them unique. But we are exploring all types of opportunities for the future. But one thing is for sure, we will not release anything with bitcoin unless its done properly. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:34:28
These are all real problems we took into account. This is why this note will release as a concept and is not meant to be used in commerce. Its essentially a cold storage wallet at the moment. But it gives us a chance to test the market and explore the idea better.
However, we are working on figuring out how to solve those issues you mentioned above. Likely, it will consist of working with a high level secuirty printing company (that prints real money) and insurance. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 01:22:15
We'd recommend a website like: 
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:10:41
These will retail at $6.99, €6.99 or £6.99 depending on your region. 
And yes, a whole series is planned from 0.1 to 1 BTC. Problem being that printing these professionally costs a lot of money so we could only start with one. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:01:42
They really can be! Which makes this seem even more viable for circulation. And we are considering our options in that regards. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:59:41
With the circulating edition we will naturally have the tamper evident sticker already added on the note. The tamper evident sticker will be completely custom designed with another security feature reducing this issue. 
Naturally even then its still a work in progress and we'd warn our users to use caution. You can never be 100% secure. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:18:24
I don't think I clarified this correctly. No one at Polymerbit will see the key because the final loading step would be conducted by a company that is already trusted with private keys and has been for a long time...
EDIT: Spelling mistake on cla.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:02:37
No worries at all. Yes, but only if the following is met. This product can go one of three ways (or eventually end up as multiple). 
No to very limited Circulation: 
We can see a benefit in creating an NFC note that the user loads at home (how we did today) and only really shares it with close family and friends. We offer no gurantee and warn that circulation is at the users on risk. Naturally here we don't see the private key and the user adds the sticker himself after loading the note. 
Assuming Limited Circulation: 
We produce notes with small amounts of BTC that are insured, working closely with the community (maybe putting BTC in escrow or something). Offering a gurantee of sorts until a certain date to the original user. After which we recommend the user moves the BTC to another wallet or proceeds at his own risk. 
In the even of limited circulation: We have warned users to only only use and swap the note with other trusted users. With some risk remaning that the previous user may have tampered with the note. 
Assuming Full Circulation:
We are very well aware of people (and companies) who have stolen private keys. While we personally may have good inentions, things can still go wrong... 
Naturally here we don't see the private key. 
1) Therefore the way I envsion this working is working with BTC dealers who have experience, are trusted, insured, and follow what is considered a secure method, secondly; 
2) We still warn people about the dangers, including EMP and magnets (in all cases). But to be fair.. this is no different than a phone or holding it on a PC.... 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:46:09
That may be, but at the end of the day it is impossible to remove risk completely. Only reduce it. Even a user loading the notes themself will run the risk of having their keys stolen. 
Its about balance, and I'm aware that the community does not take kind kindly if this balance is disturbed. 
EDIT: But innovation cannot occur in the physical market if we are paralysed by fear of the possibilities. If that was the case no one would use BTC atms by third party companies. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:07:26
Sure, here is basically the instruction sheet: 
There are two NFC chips, one public and one private. The private one gets blocked and cannot be read until the tamper evident sticker is removed. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:49:26
To be fair this is true, we have been looking at options following the traditional key printing methods. For circulation that may be useful. But for limited uses NFC is much more straight forward. 
I can see this being useful as a christmas gift to a person new to BTC or something. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 13:20:37
We already produce such notes as a concept, tamper evident seal and all included. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 11:39:34
Oops, it was like 4 am when I was writing that :P
@_date: 2016-02-01 12:22:29
To be fair that was just a sample QR, I din't even know it had bitcoin on it! 
@_date: 2016-02-01 14:54:38
@_date: 2016-02-01 01:55:03
I've been doing lots of research and found that the use of those private keys on banknotes are a bit risky. The banknote could be passed on and the bitcoin stolen before the new owner gets to cash it in. 
Thought that maybe instead I should find a reputable bitcoin exchange to hold and insure the coins. All banknotes printed could be verified to be loaded with 1 BTC. People could always redeem them (well, until the exp date, until approx 15 years from issue). 
@_date: 2017-04-20 13:17:02
I should've been clearer.. these aren't certificates. Meaning that 1) we don't hold the coins and 2) we don't ever see the private key, it would be manufactured in a secure facility that already prints money. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 06:51:35
Hmm.. not bad at all! But I dont know if people will like writing on thier notes. It feels like the ink would get smudged and there would be issues with falsified value checks. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 03:28:02
I'd be worried about the layer getting scratched from normal wear and tear, also the problem is you can make this scratch layer easily at home. 
I think it is much safer to make a unique QR code that writes 'VIOD" if peeled off. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 02:31:12
I was thinking of getting the funding needed and printing the notes in November. :) 
@_date: 2016-02-01 01:49:05
Thank you, its took quite a bit of work. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 02:17:51
Well I envisioned as two possibilities. 
1) The person could 'redeem' the note online for 1 BTC and then destroy the note (remove the QR). The website would in any case list that banknote as no longer valid. 
2) Ship to the company with the bitcoin address they want it sent to. 
The banknote has an expiry of about 15 years from issue. And the idea is that the bitcoins are insured and the company under obligation (by law) to redeem these bitcoin until expiry. 
Also, I think there should be a clause that the issuer must, on the same day, buy 1 BTC for every BTC banknote sold.  
@_date: 2017-04-20 06:52:55
Yeah I realise that the country isn't 100% stable. But one could argue that this is exactly when and why they'd need it more than ever. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 11:43:41
Its common practice with company issued banknotes. This expiry date can always be extended if the company is still in business. 
To be fair even most government issued notes around the world have expiry dates, set by the countries bank. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 11:19:35
Ofcourse you could try to print copies, but it won't be 100% the same. Furthermore, as every single note would be linked to the server, it would be caught pretty quickly that it's a fake. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 11:40:38
You mean a non valid note?
@_date: 2017-04-20 06:53:43
While you woulden't trust a paper wallet made by a stranger. I think a note made by a security company would be a different ballgame. 
Edit: i
@_date: 2016-02-01 03:36:46
Could you please PM with more info. I think you're on to something here. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 13:18:18
It would be great if that technology could be incorporated on the notes. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 02:02:13
I don't really see how it would be misleading. The company issuing these would be bound by UK law to back every bitcoin with a genuine one and exchange it at any time for 1 BTC until the exp date. 
Therefore, the person who holds the banknote does indeed own the BTC. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 14:02:11
I respect your point, however; 
The same could be said for someone illegally printing USD or EUR notes. We can add security features that are not easily detectable but are there to curb such attempts. These features would be not be caught by a printer willing to break copyright as it is safe to assume that most non legitimate printers won't have the same technology as an established company playing by US laws. 
I have thought about 3G tech or GPS, but I don't think we are quite there yet to make something cost effective. In the next 10 years it might be feasible. 
I should add that the QR (void if removed) is a separate sticker that would also embed unique hidden serial numbers that with an algorithm created by us would match the serial number of the note. 
For example: A0000001= uodoibzjdn10302
                    A0000002= dsfiusfbldfs20281
We'd be able to verify its legitimacy by accessing a private database that then matches the two numbers together. As long as that is kept safe, that is another layer of security.

It might sound really strange, but it is legal to produce your own Banknotes.There are very specific laws and guidelines, but as long as you aren't coming fraud, you can get away with it.

No, it is legal for me to print money as long as I don't claim it is legal tender. Technically these would be a company issued document. Not a banknote.  
@_date: 2016-02-01 03:16:04
Thank you, I'll try my best to make this happen! 
@_date: 2016-02-01 03:15:05
Thank you or the heads up! I think its best to ask for people to send them in. 
The good news is that security features have improved vastly over the last few years. I can always work with the printing company to get more security elements in the note. 
The website could also be encrypted and contain all the serial numbers of valid notes. 
At the end of the day, we are talking about a banknote that needs to have the same security as a 500 Euro note due to its value.

Thank you for the heads up! I agree actually. You are absolutely right that the core concept of bitcoin is to be decentralised. That is a pretty  awesome concept. 
But heres the thing, I think that the reason why bitcoin is not really mainstream (compared to currency) is because at the end of the day its on an app that a part of the population would has no idea how to set up. 
I'm not saying that all bitcoins should be paper, but I think that having this option, even if those bitcoin are temporally decentralised, is a good tradeoff to get more people on the movement. 
The note can always be cashed in and the bitcoin freed and put into a new wallet.

Well for one, when I'm not working on this project I will be attending a masters. It's a pretty convenient location.
@_date: 2016-02-01 02:42:31
As there is a a pretty substantial start up cost to have these printed. I was thinking with starting with the 1BTC and then gauging the response from the community. 
I am also designing 0.5 BTC, 0.2 BTC, 0.1 BTC and a 0.05 BTC notes but those might not see the light of day. All depends :) 
I'm also working on Litecoin notes. 
@_date: 2016-09-25 23:34:35
Right now our target is novelty banknote collectors and cold storage enthusiasts. We then hope to eventually sell our polymer notes (legally) with BTC already included to anyone interested in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-09-26 07:33:30
It was actually this sub that made us think twice about releasing these notes with Bitcoin. It was clear that aside from legal issues, it's a bit of a trust issue, the private QR could be compromised if we don't do this project properly. Therefore, we actually are trying to make a rock solid plan to create a robust, insured and legal note. One of the things we will need to do is use the revenue from these concept notes to keep refining the actual end plan so that we don't get shut down or have issues with delivering truly uncompromisable Bitcoin. There are ways to do this properly, but it takes time and we are in no rush if persistence will help deliver a safer and better product.

We don't even sell bitcoin... 
Just print and design banknotes. Your money is safe

It is pretty sweet!

Legal Hurdle: 
We are familiar with the issues capacious had as its operations were branded as money transmitting. Not permissible without a proper license. 
Our Solution: 
These laws are also in place in the UK but not the Isle of Man. We plan to relocate there if these notes prove popular. Check out TGBex.com as an example. They are legally selling what capacious was attempting to do. 
Verification Hurdle: 
Another issue we are well familiar with is verification and the risk of the private QR on cold storage being compromised. We know of instances where bitcoins were stolen even during the production of the private QR. This basically kills the start up. 
End User Solution:
In the event that we actually print loaded notes, the private QR code would be covered by a tamper evident sticker where the public QR would be printed onto. This should allow people to verify that the balance is on the note. We will print these QRs using ink and microprinting that should be difficult to replicate and can act as a security feature (to avoid people from printing another fake public key to make the note seem valid). We are in communication with a few security companies to find a fool proof method to secure the physical side. Pretty much everyone has a smartphone, so we can sanction two known accurate applications that can read the balance on the public QR. If we do create these notes, they still will not be sanctioned to be used in commerce until we are sure the system is robust. One step at a time. 
Manufacturing Solution: 
We plan to use an offline computer running ubuntu and the well respected/ secure bitcoin wallet application 'Armory' to load BTC on these notes. 
General Assurance: 
I also know that we could basically sign every coin we load and take responsibility if the notes were somehow compromised on our end. 
@_date: 2016-09-25 18:27:35
We design and print currency concepts. Heres some of our work:  
Basically they are notes that you can load bitcoin onto. 
@_date: 2016-09-26 07:26:27
We will sell these notes for 6.99 each, this will cover the high cost of producing a small batch as we're doing now. Polymer is not cheap.
@_date: 2016-09-26 10:54:27
Thank you! Can't wait to see how it'll work out!
@_date: 2016-09-25 18:28:27
Yeah definitely, we've been doing lots behind the scenes but much of the focus is getting the first batch of notes printed by November. 
@_date: 2016-09-26 07:38:30
It's called bootstrapping, you work with what you have. I'm a masters student starting a course in the area, so basically this place doubles as a dorm and the office. And a pretty incredible one too.
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:16:48
These aren't preloaded, we were talking to redditors both on here and r/btc and figured at least in the foreseeable future, we will not be loading the notes. Just like u/zobraS said, promises are dangerous in this case. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 07:13:49
Thank you!

They will be on sale on  in a week from now.

Yes, both a private key and its corresponding hologram are printed underneath. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 07:15:08
This was a test of the companies abilty to print keys securely. Loaded notes would be the next logical step.
