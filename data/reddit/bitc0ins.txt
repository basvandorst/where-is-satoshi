I have a VISA Electron card and honestly, it seems like more online websites accept bitcoin than Electron. Electron works great in stores and ATMs in my country (Sweden), but almost every site I've tried to use it on declines it.
Something that does seem to work on most sites online are VISA Gift cards. They have worked everywhere for me except Newegg.com (Ended up just paying with bitcoin at TigerDirect lol) because the gift card doesn't have a billing address attached to it.

So a bitcoin version of bandcamp.com? Anyone know if this already exists?
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:56:27
Not sure about other exchanges, but BTC-e lets you create several API keys and set them to read only so the website wouldn't be able to touch your funds.
@_date: 2013-12-20 03:10:28
Not sure what I could to to help people understand it because I already do. Anything specific in mind? Anything the various info websites and YouTube videos don't include?
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:54:26
Automatic trade entries is a great idea, would make everything so much easier for the users. Not sure about other people, but I would prefer a web interface as it doesn't require any installation and you can take it with you anywhere.

That's actually a pretty good idea. Haven't looked at how armory works but with Electrum you need both the seed and the password to make a transaction right? So the seed could be stored on the website and then you use your password to make transactions, but it is not stored on the website. Would that work? I have to read more into how this works.

I didn't have time to read through all the technical details yet, but that is a really cool idea man. I'll definitely look into it.
@_date: 2013-12-20 03:14:48
I'll have a look at that video when I get some time, thanks looks interesting. I'll think more about this, could be worth a shot as it doesn't sound very hard to create.
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:01:29
Interesting, it wouldn't be too hard to make this automated either. Anyone know of another existing site that does this?
@_date: 2013-10-23 21:31:29
You mean that it will allow the user to pay with BTC at any online store?
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:39:16
Is there a company that is a middle man and has bank accounts in different countries which would speed up an international transaction? Say they have the same bank you have here in the US and the same bank the exchange has in Sweden, could't you send them money instantly and them send it instantly to the exchange?

I had the impression that zero confirmation transactions were safe enough for small purchases like that?
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:38:59
Just googled that. Interesting. What could I do to help them?
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:22:13
That could be a good idea, something that works like a paper wallet but where you don't have to think about change addresses and stuff like that.
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:58:30
Well another possible idea then haha, and it wouldn't be too hard to create either :)
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:18:53
Anyone know if something like this already exists? I guess it could just be a little screen facing the customer with a qr code and how much you're paying and then another screen facing the cashier so they know when the transaction has gone through right?
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:29:09
So just a list of things people want to buy and sell or actually pairing them up and being kind of an ebay/craigslist?
Maybe it could hook up all the places where you can already buy things and when someone searches for it on the website it tells you where to buy it and to what price. Interesting. Thoughts?
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:05:10
That's a pretty good idea and wouldn't be too difficult to do with something like Twilio. Isn't there something like this already? Maybe that was only with email.
I'd potentially be up for it if I don't get too involved with one of the other ideas. Can you send me a PM so I remember to get back to this?
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:31:20
That's actually a great idea and something I've had difficulty tracking too! And it doesn't sound too hard to create. I think I might try and throw something together tomorrow based on this, I'll let you know if I get anywhere.
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:43:10
Looks like it just lets you calculate one trade and not track your trades?
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:44:53
Would you mind giving us a link if you do remember it?
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:50:49
Is there anything stopping Americans from using a foreign exchange, say one from Sweden, aside from the delay of an international bank transfer? Is it possible for a foreign exchange to open an American bank account and let Americans deposit and withdraw using that?
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:51:10
To help people find other people to carpool with? How would that work? You put in when and where you need to go and it pairs people up or something?
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:00:15
So it'd be like coindl.com but with any coin instead of just Bitcoins? Or do you have some other ideas how it would be different?
I live in Michigan right now, but I'm from Sweden. Feel free to PM me if you have any ideas or want to work on something together.
@_date: 2013-12-20 04:14:40
Yeah. Personally I would be up for manually entering all my trades, not sure about other people though. I'll have to look into all the API's.
@_date: 2013-12-20 03:09:03
Some very useful links, thank you!

Good point of looking at the Bitcoin protocol like that. I had the idea the other day of creating a voting system using something similar to the Bitcoin protocol. Why not have all the votes go on a blockchain so they can be counted and confirmed by everyone. Removes issue of trusting the electronic voting machines.
I didn't read all of the DAC page yet but what I read was very interesting, I'll read the rest later. StorJ is a really cool idea too, I didn't read more than the first post, do you know if anyone starting creating this?
I'd love to talk more about this, send me a PM if you want.
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:34:31
What If there was a company that supplied them the bitcoin to give to the customers? And the store would pay that company in cash? Wouldn't the store not need to be a money transmitter then?

I'm from Sweden and was thinking of creating an exchange in Sweden as the main one here has had a lot of problems. I even created a prototype of an order matching engine.
I think I can do it, the problem is security. I think I know what precautions I need to take, but I don't know what I don't know. Maybe I'll keep pursuing this If I can find someone who works with website security to help me. Anyone on here work with that?
