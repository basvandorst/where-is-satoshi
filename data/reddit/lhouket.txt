Please provide the name of the bank that restricted your account. That would make it more credible especially when you have BTC withdrawals blocked too.

Please provide the name of the bank that restricted your main account. That would make the excuse more credible especially when you have BTC withdrawals blocked too.

We can be patient if you just give us a date instead of saying "very soon" for months.
Also provide more details on what the bank issues are. If there are bank issues why are there delays with BTC withdrawals too?

20+ BTC pending in 2 withdrawals. I will also report to the Aussie police with the help of my friends there.

You say you have "bank problem that held up fiat withdrawals." and why are you asking users to convert their BTC to fiat? It's easier to send BTC when you have bank problems. You obviously have no problems with fiat deposits.

The same thing happened to me. Just blocked my account without saying anything and then took 3 days to send me 1 email. Told me to not use my Coinbase wallet for business purposes. WTH! I can do everything with Paypal but not with bitcoins in Coinbase! Anyway, if they wanted to suspend my account, the least they could do was send me an email immediately, not reply after 3 days.

It's actually bad for Bitcoin adoption when merchants will never refund you no matter what.

GYFT has always been great with their BTC refunds unlike HB :(

Maybe that's why their customer service went bad. I remember a time when they had live chat.

The problem is they have not replied to the last 5 emails i sent them (all on different days).
