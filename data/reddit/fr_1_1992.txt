Their tx fees are not high.. In fact they're absurdly low... In fact they do the transactions in batches and the fees starts from as low as 0.0001 btc... Know before you talk...

It's useful to people who aren't noobs like OP...

He said **maybe** as low as 8k... Means it can also rise up which it is now around 14.5-15k...

I have a feeling we'll be telling our kids about fiat money the way our parents told us about a time without internet...

Congratulations on getting your first BTC... I too made a little under 100 USD as my first purchase... I got in at around 6k so I've almost tripled my money already... But hey, no matter the amount, our moon is far away and BTC will reach there too!!

Name him Satoshi. Get one more dog. Name him Nakamoto. Profit!!

Same here.... I am just waiting until the price drops a bit more... I'll be putting some more into it... 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:55:14
Wow... Good for you man... I wanted to purchase when the price dropped in July-August and it was hovering around 1500... But they didn't have my bank (ICICI) listed for transfer... Gave up and bought later at 5k :( 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:28:36
Naah I'm not looking to buy as of now... Waiting for bitcoin futures... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:51:16
Naah... There was some possibility he had said about fall after maybe even climbing beyond 20k too... And said that it'd be better the sooner it happens... 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:52:31
700? I think zebpay was launched recently right?

I've stopped telling her the prices today... I got into BTC at 5k... She isn't very modern and doesn't know much about tech... Thought that it's just a ponzi scheme... It took for my money to be almost 4x for her to see that it's real... Gave me some cash at around 18k and told me "multiply this".. Told her it's not a good time to buy the price may go down but she kept on bugging as she was listening me and my bro discuss the 50k and 100k anticipations lol... Had to buy some (1/3rd of what she gave me) for her just to calm her down then... Haven't told her she's lost 40% (for now) :(

What books would you recommend?? I'm a mechanical engineer still in the early stages of my career so I'm not earning much...

@_date: 2017-12-22 09:26:35
Bought and continuing to buy... This is great... Just a bit disappointed that I bought a small amount at around 19k... Well nonetheless... Buy and HODL!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:36:20
Nothing to worry about guys... Bro texted me a couple days ago that BTC will go down to around 12-13k and maybe even as low as 8k... But it will bounce back even better...
Well one prediction is true let's see how it goes next...
Also told me loud and clear - HODL!!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:10:53
Poor support in my country cost me a lot of profit... Was able to buy only after it was 5k :(
But they're mine and I love them!! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:49:13
1000$ is too low... Which bank? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:58:08
Just a Satoshi millionaire here :) 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:39:12
WOW!! That's a bummer... Well a man can hope...

I think it'd be "laughol" 
@_date: 2018-03-05 10:15:36
I think it'd be "restip"
