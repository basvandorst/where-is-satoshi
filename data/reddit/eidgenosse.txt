Dont buy Bitcoin just to get rich. 
Buy Bitcoin for the potential it could have for humanity. If you do that, you dont care that much anymore about the price.

Didnt they announce something similar back in 2014?

Like a Wallstreet-bankster :(
I hope most of the people did not buy Bitcoins for suchlike

I am no expert neither... But I remember I had to create two additional folders with 'mkdir' (testnet3 and another one), without them, it was not working.
I am stuck here:

Circle is a Goldman-backed startup. If I would have an account there, I would close it asap.

They can keep Bitcoin as volatile as they like as long as the marketcap is that low. And their main point why Bitcoin is no currencey is... its to volatile *lol*

If bitfinex received 71.5m from customers in Europe who wants to buy cryptos, why shouldn't they produce then 71.5m EURT?
I mean, all money Bitfinex received so far, is being converted to USDT and EURT, so why is it THAT unimaginable that people invested roughly 2billion $ and Euro in the last 6(?) months in cryptos? 
Considered that Thether is not only used by Bitfinex, but also by some big other exchanges. So 2billion could be reasonable. 
And even if they dont have to whole 2billion in cash, I doubt that they have 0$. Lets say they only have 1.5b $, will the missing 500m impact the whole market that enormous?
Other thougts?

Thank you for the great how-to you provided on 'medium'. 
You wrote you will create a guide on how to download and verify the main blockchain on a regular computer and then copy it to the Pi. Did you already find time to create this? I would really appreciate and thanks again :)

Thanks for the hints, I will have a look at github. Regarding the script: Since its opensource, everyone (who has the technical background) can check if there is malicious code inside. But I want to do it manually to learn as much as possible.
Good luck for your project! :)

I bought my Bitcoins for my kids. They get it in 8/10 years when they are 20. So I dont even think about selling them, since they are not really mine anymore :)
