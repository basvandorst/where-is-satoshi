Sorry guys, this may be my fault, just bought in for my mom yesterday! 
Wouldn't be the first time she flushed money down the toilet because of me.

He'll ya, I rember the first time I stumbled upon Alan Watts, initially was concerned he was some sort of old time cult leader. After listening to several hours of his talks realized how much of an amazing philosopher he was! Amazing stuff, remember to take advantage of today!

I hear ya. It's just one of those things, hodling done me well, but when I buy in for some one else it makes me nervous.

Maybe I'm an old timer, but this "crash" still has the price of btc over the 10k moon! I realize a bunch of people bought in over 15k, but the price is still incredible. Plus this dip will help dry out a bunch of shitcoins and transfer the value back to the top.

Chasing that squirrel while I should be doing work!
Anyway, coinbase is a corporate structure and I unfortunately, I'm sure like many of you, and the company I work for is much much smaller. And still the decisions made come from meeting after meeting of arguments, and the final decision and how things get implemented are not really the best option for anyone in the company. It typically is a compromise between all parties involved. So as coinbase grows the arguments on all sides will get louder as the company grows and decisions will continue to seem worse as they are just larger compromises. And the bottom line for their company is how to profit, it's not like the open source projects that are out for good change in the world.
And you even see this compromise situatuion getting worse in bitcoin, something tells me if the network were just as big as it was in 2012 that all of the awesome updates that could be added to make it better would have been implemented in a fraction of the time. That is why alt coins are needed, to test new tech before altering bitcoin and possibly ruining the network if the upgrade fails miserably. 
So what I am saying, coinbase gets a lot of bad press, but I think it is because it is a corporate like entity that is the gatekeeper to the new frontier. Think of it as bitcoin it's the settlers in the new world and coinbase represents the king of England. Eventually we will get rid of them, but they are necessary to get the resources here for now.

How would these convert to fiat? Since that would be the killer to centralized exchanges

I would hope this wasn't his first order. You don't go and spend 300k without proving the system first.
