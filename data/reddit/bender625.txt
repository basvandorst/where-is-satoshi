This chart has it all mapped out. Has a Tim Draper setting as well

I don't see any "Cash" reference. I guess maybe the coin is angled left but I think that might be "style" 
Also it looks like the gas cover is a Litecoin emblem. I can't imagine a BCH supporter repping LTC too

A buddy of mine stepped in a gross dark crusty outside but bright green liquidy inside lump as we walked back towards Market from Union Square. I'll never forget how gross it was watching the liquid fall into the heel of his Sperry's.  (・_・;)

Even you can create shitcoins now

I mean. If they can pay you straight BTC for the full price of the house.... Why not. Just have your client sell what they need to pay off their loan and hodl some

A year ago, people probably still would have shit bricks. Now two years ago, you'd have yourself a party

They own a sweet ass van that I've seen driving on the 405. It has a bunch of tiny up arrows everywhere on it and then the "to the moon" like the one above on the wheel holder thing on the back. It's freaking sweet

Nah $1(circa1912) !=$1(circa2012) but 1 Doge is 1 Doge forever

Ah gotcha. Honestly I don't see much upward movement coming on until after this next Hard Fork or people forget about China. I feel like it'll probably hover between 3-4 til then. But who really knows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Two sides of the same ZWD. Hyperinflation means each bill is worth less which means you need more bills to pay for anything leading to a lack of available cash

The NSA is SAtoshi Nakamoto.
Edit: adding proof. The first two letters of Satoshi are SA. The first letter of Nakamoto is N. You concatenate the SA to the end of the N and BOOM! NSA

No. I don't expect that much out of people at the TSA or ICE but it doesn't mean that individuals should be protected for locking up innocent people. In this scenario obviously it doesn't call for some sort of extreme lawsuit. But in more extreme scenarios then yes they should be allowed to be sued IMO.

Gf used to be the same til I laughed at that statement enough :)

This would be great. But where's 9000. How are we supposed to post Vegeta memes if 9000 isn't on the list.
