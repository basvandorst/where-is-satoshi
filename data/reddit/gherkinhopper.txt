This shit is so stupid and embarrassing to anyone who knows anything you do yourself a massive disservice by posting it. The backing is the entire financial system and the relationships it has. Don't kid yourself that your amazing South Sea Bubble Internet Money is "The One" that overturns the apple cart. If you only learned this year that most currencies are fiat then that picture should be your profile pic

For fucks sake: WHAT IS THE SCAM? Are they stealing funds? How does the scam work?

Am I the only one who sees this chart saying that below $1k is the target? Maybe even closer to $500?
@_date: 2018-09-08 11:20:07
Awesome headline. Also, no coin holder says bitcoin going to zero. 
@_date: 2018-09-29 12:31:59
When it hits $2? 
@_date: 2018-08-26 03:40:29
No.  This will never happen. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 02:52:18
Could this ever happen to bitcoin payments?
@_date: 2018-03-19 07:48:32
How long will it take for a confirmation of a payment to go through?
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:17:59
Wow! That's very different to here. Pretty interesting 
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:28:34
So let me get this straight: you now own 0.0485 BTC? Alright!

Most places won't accept personal checks. They never did unless they know the person. You see the sign when they DO accept personal checks. Bank checks, sure. Hardly anyone accepted personal checks in Australia unless they knew the counter party.

OMG this is fucking retarded. The sort of people who follow this fuckwit are exactly the sort of morons who’d believe that “fiat currency” will be in trouble or collapsing imminently. It would have been way more interesting to sample some intelligent people who aren’t lost in their conspiracy theories. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 12:06:11
Ahh. That will help. The volatility still rules itnout though. No one will want to own something so volatile. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:37:15
People took personal checks from people they knew. And a credit card is backed by the bank so you know you're getting the money it's just  matter of when. 
A 10 minute bitcoin transaction will make queues pretty long at any pay point. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 11:09:26
Sounds legit AF
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:17:31
Wow! Now that's a different experience.  That's interesting 
@_date: 2017-09-14 08:41:52
Am I the only one who noticed that the apples are now worthless due to excess supply?
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:12:08
Not trying to be rude, but the statement "Everyone can have an apple instead of just the ones who can afford them" is universally recognised as the way to make the apple worthless. I think bitcoin limiting their number is a great idea. If we could all have infinite bitcoin they wouldn't be trading &gt;$4k

It's. It true that government pegging to US dollar are deliberately ceding power to more credible central banks. There are 3 important things with monetary policy (trinity monetary policy) and you can only control 2 of the 3. There is the free flow of capital, there's control of interest rates, and there's a floating currency. By pegging to another currency you get to control the other 2 (free flow capital and interest rates).

Well that completely rules out bitcoin as a medium of commercial exchange. The volatility is another absolute negative. Not in this lifetime I'm afraid. Look elsewhere for something that can become the backbone of commerce. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 23:20:24
Yes. This comparison is not applicable. It's a protocol that's being used as a currency. You should be comparing Bitcoin to the global supply of USD for a more realistic monetary comparison. 
I think the bitcoin number is approx $5 trillion and the USD is around $10.5 trillion

What about: Dad did you really piss our inheritance away on some electronic coin? WTF man?
@_date: 2018-07-28 12:54:22
Don't you mean Bitcoin vs Alt-coins?
@_date: 2018-04-07 12:04:07
2 glaring problems at first glance:
1) survivorship bias 
2)  this needs to be measured as a % of population. 50 million people meant a hell of a lot more 100 years ago than it does today.

As if this wasn’t always going to happen. Everyone trades them and considers them an investment etc. of course they’re going to end up subject to tax regulation and SEC regulations. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 12:22:21
I don’t understand why bitcoin has to survive? Blockchain will be useful as all fuck, but we don’t need to own bitcoin for that. The genies our of the bottle here. Why does bitcoin have to survive?
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:29:41
She gonna double down too?
@_date: 2018-12-14 09:16:38
Ahh total bullshit. I’ll bet my nutsack they almost all sold at some point. The only HODLers are conspiracy nuts and dead people. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 12:32:22
Correct. N=1 for this wonderfully predictive pattern. Let me know when you get 200+ data points
@_date: 2018-12-21 11:58:44
What the fuck? How does that happen? That’s crazy
