He sold explosives that he stored in his apartment - endangering his neighbors. We have laws and rules for a reason. 


So is drunk driving, making meth in your apartment, etc. A non-crime until someone gets hurt. People could raise tigers and lion in their apartment. It's a non-crime until the animal gets loose and kills someone. 


No. I didn't painted him as anything you worthless shill. I was just pointing out that he is a convicted felon who VOUCHED for mt.gox. That's FACTS, not painting.

If madoff ever got out of prison, he'd find a lot of investors in It's mind boggling that people still trust karpeles and would invest in his company.

God what a fucking worthless shill. Scum like erik voorhees is what's wrong with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:52:15
NO. It's because mt.gox got "hacked" and mt.gox was sending fiat money AND bitcoins to "unknown entities". That's why karpeles started demanding PROOF of identity. So stop with your bullshit.

UTTER NONSENSE. The only "developers" who litter SQL code in their PHP code are "fine art" majors turned web "developers" who just finished "learn php in 21 days". This is why web "developers" are viewed as a big fat joke. The only reason people do this is because they don't know what they are doing and just googled tutorial code and copy and pasted. 


That's why mysql was viewed as a joke in the IT community. The creator of mysql even demanded that referential integrity be done in presentation or business layer until he got laughed at. 


What? Are functions "function" culture? Stored procedures allow you to hide, encapsulate, SECURE and manage your code. Would you rather send your entire sql code across the network or just a simple stored procedure call? 


No database requires a dba to manage them. But in a SERIOUS business/development environment, you don't want code being arbitrarily updated ESPECIALLY ON PRODUCTION. 


Are you fucking out of your mind? 
The fact that you are being upvoted means that there are a lot of shit "developers" on reddit.

You think sacrAmento kings and Overstock.com are pumping up the price of bitcoin because they use bitcoins?
What a dumb fucking cockroach. Maybe sacrAmento kings and overstock.com are manipulating the USD also.
I'm just giving my opinion on why the bitcoin prices JUMP all over the place you dumb fuck. It's fairly obvious what is causing it. The ukrainian crisis. And when the ukrainian crisis dies down, watch the price drop as the launderers sell their bitcoins to cash out. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:08:53
The only thing bitcoin is good for nowadays is speculation and money laundering. 
The money launderers are moving cash out of ukraine, russia, etc . The problem is that they will eventually have to sell the bitcoins for cash. And the more money they move through bitcoins, the more the feds are gonna crack down...
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:36:03


Nah I don't think so. There is one dominant "ideology" and a small number of skeptics.


No. If anyone says anything remotely positive about bitcoin, then they are hailed as heros ( larry summers ). If someone say anything remotely negative, they are slammed. 


I agree. Anything to pump bitcoin is the real ideology of If putin said that bitcoin is the best idea since sliced bread, putin will be the hero of Anything to lure in more suckers so that scum can dump bitcoins.

No moron. The dominant ideology is greed. To dump bitcoins on the next sucker. That is the dominant ideology.


With only one goal in mind moron.
It's isn't coincidence that the top post on the frontpage is about the price jump. You wouldn't see that if the price dropped...

Yes. He is a convicted felon. A person who willingly broke a law to make money. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:27:18


After ver vouched for karpeles, probably a lot. 


Where did I say they were one and the same person you worthless cockroach?

What about karpeles message in morse code?

Sure failure is an option if you know what the failure was. Right now everyone is in limbo and nobody knows what happened. What kind of failure was it? Fraud, theft, hack, martians or insiders colluding to rob the sheeple?

Karpeles, Ver ( a convicted felon who vouched for mt.gox just a few months ago ) and kraken's ceo are good friends...
And half a billion is a lot of money...
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:30:45


He doesn't count it because no one can force him to give it back or account for it. 
The only reason he declared bankruptcy is because the BANKS caught up to him about missing fiat money. Karpeles has to deal with REAL banks about "REAL" money issues. He could've dragged the bitcoin community on FOREVER. 
If you read the guy's translation, it was the japanese banks inquiring about missing funds that forced karpeles hand. Otherwise, karpeles could have gone on forever. People have been inquiring about bitcoin withdrawals for nearly a year and mt.gox just kept on going. A bank inquires and mt.gox shuts down within a month. 
It's obvious the bitcoins and the money are gone. If the bitcoins existed, he would have sold them and made the banks go away so that he could continue to lure in more deposits ( fiat and btc ).
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:26:24


None of them are legit. The CEO of kraken is a close friend of mark and he worked for mtgox before. 


None of them have transparency and none of them are trustworthy. It's mindboggling how nutjobs say you should never trust your bitcoin with an exchange and then peddle some bitcoin exchanges as trustworthy.
@_date: 2014-03-03 01:11:19
Other than being a greedy bitcoin shill, what's your point? 
Tell, me exactly how bitcoin would make it easier? Other than adding an extra set for them to have to convert bitcoins into dollars? 
Or you could just give your niece a $10 bill. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 13:57:11


I'd be more concerned about identity theft and the years of headaches that can cause than retrieving coins and usd that doesn't exist anymore. A passport is a terrible thing to have stolen, not to mention what other private data customers sent to mt.gox. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:15:33
Close-minded about what? I'm just stating facts moron.

He also missed out on the internet bubble collapse as well...
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:51:08
kraken's ceo worked on mtgox before and is good friends with karpeles. I'm sure it is very safe.
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:07:52
Neither did the drunk driver who got arrested. If someone randomly shoots at you and miss, nobody gets hurt. But those damn pesky POlice will arrest the shooter. I know, fucking bullshit right?
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:58:29
I love the bitcoin shills on here. They quote buffet when they want to lure suckers in ( "buy when everyone is afraid" ) and then slam him. 
The idiocy, hypocrisy and unabiding greed present here is laughable.
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:53:47


Yes. 


You can get arrested for speeding and drunk driving. Even if there are no victims. You can randomly shoot every other building with your rifle, you'd still get arrested even if you don't hit anyone. What's your point? 
@_date: 2014-03-03 01:48:35




It's 10 bucks. Have your brother or sister give it to her on your behalf.


You still haven't told me what is so difficult in filling out the form? You don't know your name?


Or mt.gox? Or you can give them cash or credit card donations so they don't have to go through an extra step or have to worry about bitcoin price dropping in value...
I know you have no niece and it's a contrived example to pump bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 02:06:24


Or if she visits you. Or you can spend a little extra on her birthday present. Use your brain.


It's not. Probably take two minutes. Most of that info is something you'd have to enter anyway moron. For tax reasons. 


Right... And bitcoins make it better how? 




Yes. 


Spoken like a true fraud. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 04:30:09
You are trying too hard and now I definitely don't believe you. But march madness is here so you can evangelize bitcoins to the masses at plenty of "sports games".


And here's a little lesson in banking and finance. Bitcoin is terrible for banks because banks are required to protect their customers money and be able to account for the money. A bank has to be able to keep a trail of where and to whom the money goes. Anonymity is not a selling point to the banks but it is a necessity for bitcoin.

I love all the happy kraken "customers" commenting on how great kraken is. Reminds me of the happy mt.gox "customers" luring morons to mt.gox to the bitter end.

Thanks. But "real" fiats don't gain or lose 50% in a day.


Unstable? Are you fucking retarded. If fiats are unstable, then what does that make bitcoins?
When was the last time the dollar lost or gain 50% in a day? 
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:33:34
Is that your way of saying that the dollar hasn't gained or lost 50% in a day? Thanks for conceding that I am right.
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:39:17


Maybe in the earlier days. These people no longer exist. They have been "converted".
Now everyone is trying to make the quick buck by bringing in more "investors". Everyone is a salesman. Everyone is search for the greater fool to dump their bitcoins on and retire.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:39:43


There is a lot you can do...
Or google "what to do in case of identity theft".
It is FAR BETTER to be proactive and prevent any damage than having to fix thing AFTER the damage has been done. You really don't want to be caught with your pants down on this one...
@_date: 2014-03-03 04:15:04
Yeah this happened...


A sports game? 




Bought at the bottom. Amazing.


How convenient.


I bet you did. "Well, the Jerk Store called, and they're running out of you!"


Well done sir. Well done. Tip of the ol' fedora.
