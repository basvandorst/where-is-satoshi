I think this is a clear indication as to why Satoshi wanted to remain anonymous. 
Craig Wright is IMO not Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi knew to much Game Theory for this.

I listened to this talk, sounds amazing but without a highly technical background I can't figure out how big this will be for Bitcoin. 
Can someone ELI5 the implications of all that was spoken about regarding Bitcoin?

Great insight. I've come to a very similar conclusion. So I created a weekly newsletter. I asked friends and family to subscribe. Once a week I send out highlights from events and developments that have happened over the past week with a layman explanation as to why its important.  
Here is why:  
* They are more likely to read a newsletter from someone they know than anyone else. 
* I'm not harassing them. They can read it if they like.
* When Bitcoin inevitably moons again and if they miss the boat. They will know I tried. 
So far the reaction and engagement has been more than I would have ever expected. I've been in crypto for a while now and this is the most success I have had in educating my friends and family.   
I highly recommend. 
  
Here's the newsletter for anyone interested.

The energy expended on securing a world wide (maybe even intergalactic) immutable, censorship resistant, and open monetary system is such a minuscule fraction of the energy used to maintain a FIAT monetary system predicated on Force, Violence, Coercion, Theft and War.

Well, what is a "Leftist"? Can we define a Leftist as a person having a tenant integral to their philosophy and ideology that the use of force violence and coercion is valid in creating their worldview. 
If so, Bitcoin as a monetary instrument is antithetical to their philosophy and worldview. So, I don't see how Bitcoin as it is provides great opportunities for "Leftists". Probably if they were to tweak it, add KYC and AML to the protocol, have central control of addresses, Blacklists, etc, etc... It would then provide leftists with great opportunities.

With Bitcoin you can go through a middle man but you have an alternative option to go directly on the Blockchain. With the Dollar you will always need to go through a middle man for electronic payments. 
It's that alternative option that makes Bitcoin so powerful.

lmao. It's not that big of a deal that I need to provide proof.

Im thinking of a world where Bitcoin is ubiquitous and FIAT funny money is dead. Closed loop, pay me to my Bitcoin address and I can use it to buy goods and services, no middle men asking who coach cuba is

Sorry, I did leave something out. I explained to them that Cuba is his nick name because he is from cuba. They replied that they "understand" but they need to look into the refugee status of Cubans and whether that falls under the embargo.. I shit you not, that was exactly what customer service told me Today and promted this post..
Get this though, the payment was to my American bred roommate.
@_date: 2015-09-16 13:10:06
Which I understand, However the payment was made to my American roomate. The fact that they want to look up the refugee status of Cuban Americans is absolutely unnecessary and absurd. 
The point of the post was to highlight why a censorship resistant money outside the control of the ~~Mafia~~..I mean Government is necessary. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 13:17:23
My mistake? I wrote what the payment was for for my own record keeping. It shouldn't be a mistake to do that. It's absurd that your account would be frozen for that.
