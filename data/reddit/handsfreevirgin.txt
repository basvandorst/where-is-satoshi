Does the update even fix the issue? Disabling CORS does nothing if the request origin header can just be spoofed
Edit - thanks for the clarification. As correctly pointed out, browsers do not allow request origin spoofing so the update does of course prevent the webpage javascript attack

Bitcoin is still the safest, most secure coin. Decentralisation is not to be under estimated.

Yes I'm aware of the logic, which is why I outlined the same process in my initial post. The context of my comment that you replied to was whether or not Bitcoin was broken. I'm suggesting that miners can't push the fee's up high enough to 'break' Bitcoin at this point in time, and it's also not in their interest.
Also, you are effectively paying a fee by mining your own transaction, as it's one less fee you can claim from someone else's transaction. But you obviously know that already.

Could be a die hard BCH supporter. Could be any number of miners.
Consider this. Most nodes will drop a unconfirmed transaction after 2 weeks. You can fill up the lower fee brackets with spam, forcing people to use higher fees. As long as your transactions don't get touched for 2 weeks, it's completely free to do and miners will, as a result, reap extra block rewards from the higher fees that people have been forced to pay.
As long as you think that more transactions will need to go through over a 2 week period than what the network can process, then it's a simple attack to pull off.

I wouldn't say so. The miners earn their crust by selling the BTC they mine. If they clogged up the mempool to the point where the fees were too high, they would lose out from the inevitable depreciation of BTC.
Also, spammers could push the fees up and up, but at some point they are banking on the fact that people *have* to get their transactions in the next block, which I think is rarely the case. If the fees get too high, people just will stop making transactions and the spammers will start having to pay for their spam transactions.

Ok. Why aren't they doing it then?
Because they obviously can't mine all of their own transactions.  Even if they could, they are missing out on fees.

Mark Karpeles had a big influence on the story of Bitcoin. (Not for the better)

Do people think that 2/4/8 Mb blocks are not viable with today's infrastructure? Seems to me like there is no commitment to continuing this method of scaling. Seems reasonable to me to increase the block size now to ease a little pressure on the network. When off-chain solutions are made available, these could be implemented and the block size could even be lowered!

His argument is that too few miners own too much of the network hashpower (i.e. Bitmain). This attacks one of the fundamentals of Bitcoin and it's strongest asset - decentralisation.
The problem is largely due to huge mining farms running specialised mining hardware. A PoW change would render this hardware obsolete, and would therefore diversify the mining pool - at least until the hardware caught up again.
However, it's certain that these miners will resist the change, and so we could well see another fork.

No doubt. But you can certainly make it much harder. Take a look at Monero for example. It forks frequently to a slightly different algorithm.
I mean, I have no idea, but maybe the algorithm can change after every block in a deterministic way based on the previous block hash. 
If there's anyone who can make it work it's the Bitcoin development team.
