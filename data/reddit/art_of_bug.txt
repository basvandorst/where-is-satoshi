It also has disadvantages, such as changing the security model (making it weaker). In your model everyone needs to trust miners and thus also a new node can be fooled to jump on an invalid chain. Basically you say - whatever miners mine is validated and we have to accept it but we can't verify it.
@_date: 2019-11-23 08:22:18
Technology is evolving. 5 years ago, there was no LN and no Segwit. Your TPS then was about 3 on chain. Today it's about 7 on chain plus many many more on LN for small payments within certain range. No one knows what will be there in another 5 years, but it's reasonable to expect further development of technology which will push the boundaries much higher again.

TL;DW why not?
@_date: 2019-11-15 08:24:55
No, they can't. Without the history, you can't say which chain is valid. It's not the most work chain that matters, it is the most work VALID chain. Just trusting the most work would open huge security hole.

this fixes that  [The Stratum V2 spec is here: V2 is a feature-rich upgrade that makes Bitcoin mining more decentralized, secure, and efficient.](
so we just need to wait a little bit for this to be widely used
also in [ the authors show the economy of such attacks is not as trivial as people thought before and hence the incentives are highly aligned (at least for now) against any such attack. Irrational players are still danger though, but abovementioned Stratum 2 fixes that by removing power from pools and giving it back to individual miners.
@_date: 2019-11-15 20:18:55
No, it does not work like that. Validation means exactly that you check the block and its transactions comply with all the rules. Proof of work is just one rule that is being checked among tens of other rules.
@_date: 2019-11-07 17:02:33
There is nothing wrong with not having your transactions checked. It's actually quite the opposite - an unchecked transaction means freedom, it's a good thing.

You can definitely build company on top of it. In any expert area you can become master and sell consultation services to others in the ecosystem. All those exchanges won't just be created by noobs, they need expert skills to back them up.

Wrong. Assume you don't have nodes with full history. A new node joins the network and it is connected to some honest nodes and some malicious nodes. Without full chain, how can the node recognise, which of the two chains that are presented is the right one? It can't. That's where many shitcoins fail as they claim to scale but instead they are losing the property of fundamental security.

I'm sorry but you really don't know what you are talking about. You claim various things but you can't support them. Show me in the code where is what you claim. You can't because no such thing is there. You say "trust PoW is Bitcoin security model", I ask where do you see it? You did not answer that. You say PoW is used to recognize which chain is the right one then you validate. I ask where do you see it? It's not there. It does not work like that. The best chain is decided using PoW only among valid chains. Invalid chains are ignored. Look into the code before you claim something so fundamental.
@_date: 2019-11-20 08:13:38
not your keys, not your coins. no additional explanation necessary
@_date: 2019-11-16 09:08:11
You can't do that. Your step 1 fails. You can not determine whether or not chain is genuine using just PoW rule. You have to apply all the rules. Then you also don't have UTXO set, you need to construct it from history (in trustless setting, not considering checkpoints etc. which are not trustless nor decentralized).
Your simplified security model basically says "trust miners". That's not Bitcoin's security model, which is much stronger. In Bitcoin's model, miners can not steal money from users, in your model it's possible.

You don't trust in Bitcoin, you verify. Your node verifies that all blocks from genesis are following all the rules that Bitcoin prescribes. Then the most work chain among all chains that pass such validation is the best chain. All non-compliant chains are ignored regardless of how much work they have.




Yes, except that you don't know which chain it is. To determine that you need the history or trusted source.




It's absolutely not. This is your model, not Bitcoin's. Show me where in Bitcoin it says "trust the proof-of-work". That's nonsense. Nowhere in the code you have it. Why do you say that or think it is the case?




It's implication from above. If you don't verify everything yourself, you don't know what is the actual valid UTXO set. Hence you can be fooled to accept invalid one where a coin was spend against the rules.

Every human action requires energy. If the action is done in efficient way (like mining with the most efficient ASIC is) then it is not wasteful provided that someone is willing to spend their resources on it. Wastefulness is subjective and if the action produces greater value (for the one who initiates the action) than the value of consumed resources it's simply not wasteful by definition. It could be subjectively wasteful to other people but it's little of their business if it's not their resources that are being consumed.

First of all, the whitepaper is not specification of Bitcoin. If you think it is, please quote where it says there will be no more than 21m coins. There is no such thing of course. The whitepaper briefly describes general concepts, but it does not specify any details and it is not exhaustive specification of the protocol.
Second, there are several errors in the whitepaper. So if something is in the whitepaper, it does not mean much.
Third, what specifies the protocol is the reference implementation, known as Bitcoin Core. Regardless of what the whitepaper says - or any paper or person - if it is not implemented in the code, it's not relevant.
For example, nowhere in the whitepaper you can find what longest chain is. Naturally, it would be chain with most block, but in the code you can find that is not the case and it is strictly the first valid chain that the node received among all chains with the most cumulative PoW.


This is related only to valid chains, not any chain.


Yes, this is again talking about valid chains only.


As explained, it's not really longest, but first one valid with most cumulative PoW. See AcceptBlock method - 
There are other relevant methods, but start with this one.
Anyway, tomorrow is Mentor Monday on you can ask someone to review our discussion if you still think you are right.

The book is good, but could have been much better if the author refrained from personal attacks against Keynes, up to the point of pedophilia accusations, and stayed with critique of his opinions and work, which is to be rightfully criticised.

If you think you can't trivially attack non-electronic voting on massive scale, you are naive. It happens in many countries in all sorts of different way. For example in some schemes votes for each party is on separated paper, thus you can buy N-1 papers from people who value money over vote in order of making sure they can't vote against you... There is also shitload of trust to few people in non-electronic vote. It's not that electronic way can't be made on par with it.

you should use new address for every new transaction, but a single transaction can be divided to multiple payments to the same address without any risks
you are right then the malware can modify the target service interface such that it seems your deposit went to the service when it did not, but this is not how current malware works as it is rather generic string replacement software for any web content rather than service specific. thus checking small payment in the target service interface gives you protection against most such malware, possibly all of them currently in wild

The attack as you describe it is not viable (i.e. you are greatly exaggerating possible impacts). Yes, you can modify RNG, but that does not affect as much funds as you are describing. For example Coldcard HW users, if they follow instructions on generating the entropy with dice throws are immune against your attack.






Of course most users do trust RNG and do not come with externally created seed, but it's a simple solution. You are right though that you still have a problem of knowing the external entropy was used, but that's making the attack much more complex than just RNG infection, which is somewhat simple.
Another example of non-vulnerable approach is the passphrase used in e.g. Trezor wallet.
Also more "enterprise" solutions such as Casa's are immune to this attack and it's those wallets that are expected to hold most funds. Same with exchange wallets. All in all the described size of the attack potential is way exaggerated which makes your proposal less likely to be taken seriously.
Also, as an attacker, if you had this pot you're talking about, you can't just take everything. The price would go down so quickly if you did that you would have very little profit.
As for the proposal itself, you spend time parsing transaction instead of describing important details about the scheme itself. And the devil is always in the details, so you need to describe everything to the last bit.


You have not described construction of this key, nor how the wallet is using its private key etc. That's important. You don't need to describe functionality of known OP codes.
As for the KoinKeep set of devices you are selling - seems like they don't have a display...?

This is possible, but only theoretically. All you need is a binary data long enough to include a pattern that is recognised by antivirus software. The antivirus software would need to be very stupid, but that is legitimate assumption. A lot of antivirus products are crap. So if by default it does scan the network traffic, it could detect such a pattern. However, you would need to have a miner computer (or any of the computer on the critical path to a miner) to have such antivirus installed, which would be quite stupid set up. So for this to actually happen, you would need to have a stupid miner with stupid antivirus. Not very likely combination
