yes, its an exchange. otherwise people wouldn't use money at all they'd just barter for everything and avoid taxes.

Just report the transaction to your CPA. He or she will know what to do

your short term losses will offset your short term gains. net your losses and gains together and whatever the excess is you'll owe taxes on that amount

I don't think you're understanding what I'm saying
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:09:02
You don't. You only pay taxes on the amount of the gain. You'll have to prorate the gain to the amount of btc you used in the exchange. Which will be a pain in the ass, but probably not expensive tax-wise.

yeah, we view it as a currency but from the government's perspective (aka for tax purposes) it is a capital asset (basically property)
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:40:08
thanks for the laugh. you're clueless
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:55:42
If that were legal then why would people use cash for anything? They'd just barter for all their goods and services and never have to pay any tax.
No, it's an exchange and is a taxable event.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:57:36
That is not true at all. Otherwise parents would just put all their investments in their minor child's name and not pay any taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:59:14
its obvious I'm not going to change your mind, so why bother
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:51:50
its essentially the exact same as selling a share of stock
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:39:33
this is 100% wrong. you are liable for the tax as soon as the property is sold.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:15:45
This is IF THEY HAVE NO OTHER TAXABLE INCOME (i.e. a salary)
use IRC §1(h) to calculate.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:46:18
BTC isn't a currency from the governments (tax) perspective.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:40:25
yes, you need to pay taxes on the gains from when you originally cashed out your BTC to USD
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:18:03
everyone would just use a barter system if you didn't have to pay tax on exchanges. cmon man.

whatsup UF CPA. lots of misinfo in the crypto world
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:00:25
Yeah, I never said otherwise. OP said he doesn't have to pay capital gains because he's a minor, which is totally untrue
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:22:52
you can deduct your sales taxes if you itemize
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:33:22
the default IRS treatment for stocks would be FIFO (first in, first out),  but I believe you can use avg cost, lifo, or specific ID if you make the proper elections.

I do tax work and can answer any questions you may have. Section 1(h) of the tax code calculates capital gains tax if you're interested.
