he's the one who owns the site hoping one of us will be dumb enough to try it and post back here

Yeah they'll probably say oh yeah our website says 3 days but it's really 7 days. 'Arriving Today' is actually just a trademarked technology today. 
Sorry we don't operate on blockchain we're using patent pending technology Arriving Today.

Been into coin collecting for years so once I heard about bitcoin I figured why not start collecting e-coins.

Just making first deposit said 3 days. On the third day it said ARRIVES TODAY. It still says that and it's been over 48 hours.

Coinbase keeps extra both in and out to create a giant slush fund which they make side investments with.

Yep first time depositing was $300 on Monday. Still waiting to get the Bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-03-26 07:00:47
Next day still no bitcoin

You mean a certified fan boy?
@_date: 2016-03-25 22:25:01
Is 'arriving today' an actual estimate or your patented technology?

I was thinking of a cold storage wallet where the private key is encrypted with the pass phrase from a secret book. The book can be a rare edition and not necessarily in English and there is no reason to limit the length to 12 words. 
I think the base number of amount of words would be a lot higher in most other languages. For example French has a similar amount of words as English but many more conjugations. Japanese has a huge amount of words too. 
Also there is no limit on how long the pass phrase has to be because you can simply use the format [page,paragraph, word, length] and just as easily remember a 100 word pass-phrase as a 12.
I'm imagining a scenario in which the cold storage wallet has both been stolen and the secret book has some how been found out. So for a rare French book using 100 word pass-phrase we could expect at least:
This should take a long time.

Exactly and in my situation I intend to use bitcoin right away. I had a message which said ARRIVING TODAY starting on Thursday which is still there today. I wish they just told me it was going to take this long so I wouldn't look like an idiot telling my friend it was set to arrive on Thursday.
@_date: 2016-03-26 22:02:01
I figure Tuesday because banks are closed on Easter Monday at least in Canada not sure about the US. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 06:21:02
I'm still waiting for my bitcoin is that pathetic
@_date: 2016-03-26 03:24:02
I liked it because I'm having my own issue with coinbase
@_date: 2016-03-25 22:37:30
it should have arrived yesterday.
@_date: 2016-03-25 22:24:32
I commented on your support forum and here before bed. Waking back up and I still have no bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-26 10:36:25
Get real there are apps that pay you watch tv these days. Like I'm going to pay a rich director voluntarily.

Deposited on to Coinbase 4 days ago and for the 48 hours the site has said ARRIVING TODAY.
I reached out to support and was told ARRIVING TODAY is actually the name of their patented technology. Does anyone know how many days ARRIVING TODAY technology takes to deposit transactions?

What kind of website has a reddit page but no one can actually post. Basically a fake reddit page.
