Because if people respect you, there will be more opportunities in life. If you tell people you have a massive amount of debt they might think you are irresponsible with money. I'm not saying you should ALWAYS care what people think about you, but there's more upsides than downsides to people respecting you.

I think the problem right now is that the support tickets been piling up for months. I opened a ticket three months ago about something minor and they still haven't responded yet...

Andreas M. Antonopoulos is if I'm not mistaken one of the early developers of bitcoin core, who now educates people about crypto as a fulltime job. He has tons of very interesting and informational vids on his youtube channel. I advice you to check it out! [Link to his channel](

Yeah so your whole statement makes no sense. Same as saying:
"Nobody has ever died while climbing a mountain, it's totally safe"
"Unless you count the ppl who fell off"
"Well obvs"
