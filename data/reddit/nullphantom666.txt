`for i in 0..2**256 {checkPrivateKeyForBalance(i);}`
There. I cracked your uncrackable problem.

Actually, no. I won't touch any sdd/hdd. I'll parse the blockchain to create a list of all addresses that have any balance and store it in cpu cache. I'll create ten thousand such cpu cache combos. I'll then have the quantum computer generate public key from private key (most computation heavy task) and then pass on that key to a controller that will then pass on the key to one of the ten thousand cpu cache combos for searching. If a match is found, it will be forwarded to a separate result collector.
Ps. This is all hypothetical bull shit. Don't try to scrutinize it lol.

For sending a text(sms) , you need their mobile number and a mobile network provider to send the text through.
For sending btc, you need their wallet address and a remote node to which your mobile wallet can connect to. And internet but I guess it's easy to get at most places.
The challenge is that very few people use btc today. Imagine if only 1/50 people had cell phones.

So you are saying that you can't do it because people don't use it. I agree. 
The technology is already here but I never claimed that it's in use by people. As far as block confirmation goes, you can use ethereum which has avg 15 second block time.
Point being, the technology does exist. It's not practically usable is separate argument.
