Ah I was referring to converting the ZAR to EUROS:)

When you say the DB is gone forever, have you lost the db file, or is it corrupt?

GPU mining for bitcoin? Pfft
@_date: 2018-08-13 18:06:02
Alone it may not be worth it...but alot of 0.001's over time all add up. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 12:53:09
Please dont,I want try and solve it without any additional hints:)
@_date: 2018-10-04 14:55:12
Blimey that's massive, I extracted a hex value but no where near that big
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:11:46
I'm out, I've got no chance of solving this before the BTC is taken. Good luck all you smart people!
@_date: 2019-03-07 07:56:29
Not enough, I would both GPU mining for BTC. ASICS killed that dream a long time ago. What about mining GPU friendly coins and swapping them to BTC?
@_date: 2018-10-31 08:21:08
ah buddy, dont be so harsh on yourself! Your not stupid, these things a f**king hard, and everybody will tackle these puzzles differently, you have probably been going down a path that I havent even thought of, and it could bear fruit, the path I have been down has had so many dead ends!

You should give the book "The Creature from Jeckyll Island a read" . All money in essence is not real, and these "goverment assets", I would imagine are just IOU's to the bank saying that the tax payer will pick up the cost if they default on them....and they more than likely will.

ive managed to generate a 12 word BIP wallet using all the clues he has provided, however it is not the HD wallet which contains the private key. I am sure I had it this time as it works off each clue they gave.....back to the drawing board I guess!
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:42:39
You rock!
@_date: 2018-10-05 16:12:37
That's exactly what I thought regarding the L and K, however unless this generates the First part of the key and the second part is calculated somewhere else....that other part I'm not sure of yet
@_date: 2018-10-04 15:21:26
Cool, I've managed to get a return value of "Ok ay", but I suspect that's a red herring:)
@_date: 2018-10-04 08:55:49
Awesome! I'm gonna try and keep track of all the pub addresses, as if it's a team effort everybody is entitled to some of the reward!
@_date: 2018-10-04 15:03:21
Excuse my ignorance but how did you figure that out? I don't expect you to help me, but how did you break it into Rows/coloumns?
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:19:49
I think that's a great idea, I think I'll get to a stage and then I'll reach a dead end:( 
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:52:21
I have to be honest, the QR code did not even cross my mind, as soon as I saw the picture I had another plan of attack which gave me the OKAY, however it looks like I've done things in the wrong order
@_date: 2018-10-08 15:37:10
@_date: 2018-10-31 08:15:10
Its not complex at all, the previous cipher game for $200 I came up with around 5 or 6 12 wordsets and none of them were for the wallet. I believe that the numbers and the words make up the 12 words. Why have us focus on the numbers? I think you need to solve both to get the words:) I found the number side of things harder than this word solution.
@_date: 2018-10-04 08:06:33
That's interesting, did you pass the image into a filter? There was no steg stuff in the image. I'm assuming the private key in the I agree is a mini private key due to its 22 character length, but it's missing an S, however the Hex for S is there.
@_date: 2018-10-07 18:34:39
Has anybody noticed a "B" hidden in the image anywhere, besides the Bitcoin logo? There is a dark A on the right hand side, but I just want to make sure I'm not missing it...
@_date: 2018-10-07 08:23:30
Great work! Of course we are assuming that the volonoi is there to be used, it could be just a red herring, like so much else in this image. Rumours of RAR and zip files in the image are abound too, but I am very sceptical of this, as I have scanned the file but found nothing...I think the encryption key is hidden in plain sight in the image, kinda like a Quija board, it's just figuring it all out.
@_date: 2018-10-04 08:09:12
Also to add what does the ASCII to Text of that HEX of the SHA256 HASH
@_date: 2018-10-06 06:15:51
I'm also working on another idea, which I'll share if it bears any possible fruit:)
@_date: 2018-10-07 16:54:05
Hahaha, you know if the creator actually did make a key as a magic eye puzzle I actually think I'd lose my shit....imagine it's literally having BTC Appear before your eyes!
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:59:19
I have to be honest, I really think it's a red herring, and it's pure luck
@_date: 2018-10-07 16:50:29
I believe that the creator hid the 4 payloads in the picture which require all sorts of trickery to find but the keys to unlock these payloads are all in plain sight, I have a few theories on where the keys to unlock the payload are, but it's just trying to figure it out and piece it all together, I'm more of a cryptic image kind of guy, all the Photoshop stuff to get the SSL stuff is kinda beyond me, so I'm hoping that once I document what I suspect that somebody else there can take it a step further..
@_date: 2018-10-07 18:40:18
Thanks dude, I just want to make sure, the B isn't working out, so I wonder if it's hiding somewhere 
@_date: 2018-10-04 20:47:33
I cannot get the QR code in gimp or cs2, would you be able to post the URL the QR code generates please?
@_date: 2018-10-04 14:52:16
Hypothetical question, would a resulting correct hash able to be verified if it was valid by NOT putting in that website? In other words if I believe I have the right hash, are there other ways to verify its valid?
@_date: 2018-10-09 11:30:40
Thanks for replying:) At the end of the day, your one of the lucky ones sitting on a BTC nest egg, and good luck to you, thanks for giving something back to us little guys, and hopefully the people who solve the puzzles can put the BTC to good use:)
@_date: 2018-10-07 16:55:42
I am hoping to type up what I've found later tonight, 2 kids and job are not helpful for BTC  detective work!
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:23:32
Dude, thank you, I'll gladly pay if I get anywhere. I cannot make heads or tails of the QR code thing? Can you explain how to find it?
@_date: 2018-10-05 14:41:14
I am gonna take a stab in the dark and assume that the 4 private keys are not all found by using a PC etc...
@_date: 2018-10-04 12:02:17
I take my hat off to you, 1 BTC would be a life changing amount, but man I'm gonna have to give up soon, I'm just not smart enough to be able to do this, I've got a few theories and a HEX key, but this is all getting to smart for me
@_date: 2018-10-03 19:55:01
I know everybody is after some hints, but I really want to take a good stab at it as is, so please no help for now:)
@_date: 2019-02-19 16:33:45
I would suggest buying BTC and keeping it for the long term. If your a newb. mining can be an expensive and daunting.
@_date: 2019-12-10 16:06:22
@_date: 2019-12-10 15:50:31
Blah blah blah blah
@_date: 2019-12-18 06:44:37
Yes of course,I’ll post a write up abit later
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:14:08
Update 3: Puzzle has been solved! I will be releasing a new puzzle in the next 7 days, perhaps a little harder!
