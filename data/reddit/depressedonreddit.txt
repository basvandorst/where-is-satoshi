I guarantee that the people who make the electrum wallet etc are gearing up for lightning already.

Boom goes the dynamite. The subpoena for Tether &amp; Bitfinex's CEO is  very telling.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:14:24
How do you feel about tether? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:05:57
Yikes... This made me understand the situation even better. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:56:38
Just because you don’t understand the utility of something does not mean that it has no use.
A good example would be someone like me who needs to send someone $3,000 in china for manufacturing. I can go through the hassle of waiting for the bank to open, going and authorizing  wire transfer, figuring out how to do that, etc. Then wait a day or more for it to process. Or, I can send bitcoin NOW. The fees are a problem currently, but its honestly a fucking life saver for me. I also order everything off amazon with bitcoin. I ordered all my furniture, pay my rent, and I even bought a car with btc. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:35:27
I know, but I just wanted to remind you how strongly you defended a company that was clearly never going to let itself be properly audited.
In most cases I would say hindsight is 20/20, but it took me about 10 minutes of digging before understanding the situation tether has put the cryptocommunity in. 
This is going to be bad. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:13:52
Some retarded kid that I sold 3k USD btc to literally bought into bit connect, and then their ICO. Kid keeps asking to borrow 3k because of the amazing returns he can get me.
Sounds like this guy.
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:38:20
You assume tether has 2.5 billion in cash reserves.

Speak for your own shit hole state. In Seattle, and other parts of WA paying above listing price and offers in cash has become normal. Your state is being destroyed by climate change and your “waterfront” mansions are going to quickly become “water” mansions.

It's believed that wash trading in SK and with BFX caused our extremely high BTC price... Lack of regulation goes two ways!
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:47:27
Look how much they're adding now, lol. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:42:39
Like I said, just because you don't understand the utility of something that doesn't mean that it's useless. Also, a wire transfer can take 1-2 days. 
You would feel that way, but I wouldn't. I prefer that things happen quickly, and I like to be in control of my own money. 
People get ripped off in the traditional monetary system all the time. 
 I'm not even a hardcore fanboy. I just recognize the utility of it and make money using it. I don't think that's extremely difficult for someone to understand. I can take a half mill to Shanghai on a thumb drive if I want. No one is any bit the wiser. I feel more safe with bitcoin than I do with cash. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:39:36
And then we'll take it higher.

I’m about to drop 45k on 3 btc lmao 
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:14:18
Way to go man, I'm in the process of selling well over 20BTC to pay off my debt, and report my long term capital gains. I am going to make well over one million in the next three years. Thank you Bitcoin. Never give up, homies. 
I am not reporting the 115 bitcoin that I spent before bitcoin hit $1200 though. I will be honest, I didn't really understand bitcoin when I was spending all that money. 
I wish I was a millionaire right now, but having just turned 23, I think I'll be alright.

@_date: 2017-12-17 19:09:20
The part about it’s easy to make money is so fucking true. I lounge about a solid 5 days out of the week like I’m a sloth and I don’t think I’ll ever need to truly worry about my finances. 
I’m glad I learned my lesson. It cost me a lot of money in retrospect, but like I mentioned, I’m nowhere near poor and likely never will be. So long as I don’t go on a “helping” binge ever again. 
The reality is that neither you nor I owe anyone who hasn’t directly helped us a god damn penny. The way that I’ve gotten around this issue is by having more financially stable friends. Some are just programmers and came from well off families, but I’ve noticed the better off their families are and the more intelligent they are, the easier it is to talk finances with them. 
My best friend has never asked me for a fucking dime. Shout on to kermit. 
God damnit, my girlfriend knocked over my water bottle, and somehow that’s my fucking fault because I didn’t put the lid on my water that was on the table?  Am I in the wrong for thinking that maybe that isn’t my fault? Sorry for the change in subject, but I’d like your opinions 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:30:46
You won’t feel late if BTC takes a dump down to $1000 again and stays there, lol.

Pay the debts. I held off on paying my debts while watching my bitcoin increase by more than tenfold. You should calculate how much your loans will compound before you make a decision. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:16:26
Good point. I wasn’t trying to sound like I was on the offense btw. I personally experienced losing that much overnight and having it gain that in a day. I just wanted to see what you thought of it.

I own 30btc+ you fucking idiot 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:45:07
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:09:22
Does it really upset you this much to see me ask someone ELSE a question? That’s how I know you’re just living in an echo chamber, dude. Asking about fees is a VERY VALID question. Do you really think bitcoin is skyrocketing because people are fucking using bitcoin more than ever, or because people are buying more bitcoin? 
Not everyone who disagrees with you is from Have I ever made a post in I don’t think so. I can think Roger Ver is a piece of shit and still notice that BCH has what looks like .20 cent fees.
You don’t need to be a fucking child if you can’t actually defend the point. You’re acting like you’re on some high fucking horse and for what reason? You didn’t even answer my question. 
You aren’t better than anyone else, and it’s clear that you lack the ability to compose a thoughtful response.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:01:14
That’s a good point. I just wonder where all these massive figures are coming from. 100k+ in one year, shit like that seems a bit manic. This sub feels like an echo chamber.

@_date: 2017-12-03 18:24:51
What makes you think bitcoin should be worth 100k next year? I thought bitcoin was a cryptocurrency, not something that people make money on with speculation. I still can’t buy a latte without spender $3 in fees.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:13:16
Present it in my ass
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:32:03
Sell it dude. I have sold a couple hundred k worth because it’s not a smart idea to invest money that you absolutely NEED. Or that you could need. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:42:16
I just used BCH because it shares the same name as BTC and seems like it has the largest amount of media presence. Not because I think it has any superiority, besides MAYBE the fees, but that's just a given. I don't think it seems functionally better than BTC and certainly don't know enough to argue either way. 
My point is more regarding why we're seeing this giant price increase when it doesn't seem like it's correlated with more adoption and use in the regular world. It seems like BTC's price is being affected more by the news about bitcoin futures, which is speculation. I'm wondering why we're seeing BTC take off so much when it seems unlikely that it's being used more by regularly people. It feels like this increase in price is artificial, or possibly just fueled by reckless speculation. 
I actually use a bitcoin debit card to pay for a lot of things, like groceries and yes, even my coffee. I also try and use bitcoin to send mail for my business, and all sorts of other shit. I even paid my rent with BTC. 
So, you are misunderstanding a little bit, but that's likely due to me not making my point obvious enough. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:25:43
Bitcoin cash’s price went up because of insider trading and a pump and dump. Absolutely disgusting.
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:18:48
I made the mistake of cashing out multiple bitcoins multiple times in the past year (well over 125 before it broke $1300). 
I'm just holding at this point. I blew all that fucking cash and now I'm only 50% invested in BTC. Paid off ALL my debt and my spouses debt. Having half a mill in coin is solid, but this shit is scary every day. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:09:24
I don’t think I said anything about communist China. 
I’m saying that for bitcoin to be adopted and used as a cryptocurrency we need lower fees. There’s no need to be snarky. You try getting people to pay another $1 on top of their coffee or bill to use bitcoin. Hopefully the lightning network blows this shit out of the water.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:08:28

@_date: 2017-12-17 18:52:05

Fuck those guys. If you can ever find out who they are, I'll send them those exploding birthday cards but fill them with fentanyl. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:43:41
I know about lightning. A 100k BTC doesn't seem rooted in anything besides speculation. 
Where is all of that money going to come from? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:41:36
Why would a giant retailer accept bitcoin if we can’t even pay for transactions for less than $3? up to $20? Do you see people using bitcoin to pay for their coffee? What makes you think the price raise has to do with adoption? Do you think 10x the amount of people started using bitcoin since June? It sounds like you’re just speculating.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:08:27
I was a little quick to jump to this, but the pump of BCH hours before a completely unexpected launch of BCH on GDAX is extremely concerning. If you are a multimillionaire or have a group of whales that possibly hold tens of millions or even hundreds of millions in crypto's, you would be able to manipulate the market if you knew BCH was about to launch on GDAX. You could probably double your net worth in a matter of hours. 
I don't even like to think about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:33:40

Bitcoin cash is way better than Bitcoin at being a currency.” Along with you posting in You don’t get to take a special high road just because I called you out for not supporting bitcoin. That’s just silly, dude. It’s okay to have a bias. I called you a troll because you’re acting like one. 
I don’t know how I feel about larger blocks, but I’m hopeful for the lightning network. Either also gets my dick hard, but I make more money from bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:44:19
I’ve helped friends out too. Seemingly good People who had good money. I have never been repaid and refuse to talk about my worth or loan anyone any amount of money. The only money I give away is to people who truly may not survive without it. Usually that’s by buying clothes and food for the homeless. Or more accurately, buying myself jackets and giving them to the homeless when they look cold.
Fuck that guy.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:13:38
I remember when bitcoin used to go up and down $100 and I would lose like 10k when I had 100btc+. Now it’s crazy dude. I had to cash out half my btc because losing 50k in a day was just insane. I held more than 95% of my cash in btc for almost two years until now. 
Honestly, I’m probably going to accumulate another 20btc, but I need to cash out like 100k before I do that. It’s just too unstable to bet my entire life on it. It scares me that other people might be doing that who can’t afford to lose that money. Like people who only have 10k that they saved up over 5 years or something. 
I did get a little immune to the $1000 swings though, so you have a good point!
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:29:59
Do you think that this growth is really sustainable? What makes you think it is? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:58:59
I cashed out at 10k, for $200,000, and I’m now going to try and buy a bunch back. But I still have a bunch of BTC, and I want to add even more.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:36:32
I love you dude. I'm really sorry. I'll be honest, I've fucked up really badly too. I sold 100+ bitcoins at around $1000 a few months ago. Then I repeatedly sold before we hit massive ATH's. I even sold a few weeks ago before the price fucking took off to $17,000. I also spent a full bitcoin a month or two ago on some useless shit. 
I'm really sorry that happened, and you didn't deserve it to happen. I guess I'm a little confused, how did your ETH get stolen? Was it some sort of a mixed wallet? Also, did you only have 1.8BTG to claim? Damn, dude.
Also, if you follow the blockchain, that guy has had over 1.1 million in BTC funneled to one of his addresses that he's used since like march 5th. 2017.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:56:24
If this happened there’s would be 20,000 other people ALL posting about this, and it would be on MSNBC. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:44:57
I appreciate that. I’m glad I’ve learned my lessons. It was a tough road, but I finally feel stable. At least in the sense that I’m not blowing money, I paid off ALL of my debt, all my girlfriends debt... everything. Bitcoin is going to buy me a house and pay for the gf’s grad school. 
Shit, I have free college on top of having all this coin. This is the happiest I’ve been in my life. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:33:01

Local bitcoins, people who absolutely need to sell are just like people who need to sell their electronics. Willing to take a fat discount to get FIAT. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:53:38
Shoulda woulda coulda. I lost 50k (ok 100k) give or take when I didn't sell all at 19,000. I did sell some though. I should've sold at the high amount but if it reaches high amounts again, I'll sell again. I also sold half my coin at 10k. My premonitions about bitcoin are based almost entirely off of greed and unicorn farts. 
Just be happy you've made good returns. 
Bitcoin credit cards would be sick, but I wonder if the issue behind that is centralization. 
I have money in from other sources, basically my own business and I was a semi-early adopter. (sub $500 BTC). 
Surprisingly, I picked up on BTC when I was 18, but I don't think I understood it's mechanism of use very well. I didn't actually invest until June 16'. Invest is a word that I use loosely, I would say I didn't throw my money at bitcoin like I have with tons of other random shit until 16'. That was after I discovered HOLY SHIT I CAN BUY DRUGS WITH THIS? 
Don't be too jealous, I've lost so much money dude. I've made a shit ton, but my life is insanely hectic. My life doesn't really have a semblance of normalcy and I'm as neurotic as they come. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:27:00

@_date: 2017-12-04 18:52:02
Thanks man, I'll work on it. So long as I don't mention who I am, I am not particularly worried. I think it could help a lot of people. 
I'm excited to buy my first house using fucking bitcoin, dude. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:39:09
That is very true. I think that it's more important that you sell when you're comfortable selling. When you get the amount that really makes you feel comfortable, and you understand that you've made such huge gains that you don't really need to keep risking that much. 
I'm sorry dude, I would have 1.5 million if I hadn't sold my coin. I understand where you're coming from. 
I'm going to probably just start saving it.  Also I'm all about paying off my debts. Which will be easily covered by that money. I'm not sure what else I'm going to do with the money, but I'm not going to spend it, that's for sure. 
I also might just buy right back in during a dip! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:31:24
Dude. 3/4 of all of your money? Come on, don't do this. If bitcoin takes a dump you're going to be in a bad, bad spot. I know, because my position was deeper than yours. 
How new are you to bitcoin? Because having the much of your money in BTC and Alts when you're new is a little concerning. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:24:49
Yeah, I'm getting so nervous that I think I might get out for awhile. I'm just selling. I may even sell all of it if I can. Then buy in during a dip. If people feel like there won't be a dip, well.. That's just crazy. 
I have no idea how long this will keep going. It could keep going for hours, days, weeks, months, maybe even years. But at some point the price does have to go down. Adoption rates would have to be growing astronomically and people using it would need to grow astronomically. It feels like bitcoin is being used for speculation right now, and I am concerned that this is leading to our inflated price. 
Don't get me wrong, I am fucking ecstatic that I will likely become a millionaire before I'm 30, but lol, I can't even buy fucking coffee with my coin right now. The fees are just too crazy for regular people to use currently. 
Bitcoin is supposed to be a currency, rather than a speculation business. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:12:14
Can someone tell me how this isn't a bubble right now? I just sold $50,000 in coin last night at $10,300, and I'm tempted to sell another $100,000 and just hold what is now $100,000 in BTC.  
I have made like $50,000 a month from bitcoin in the past 3 months, if not more. This feels like mania, and being newly 23 (thanks for the birthday gift BTC!), I don't see why I should risk my whole (small) fortune. 
Up until this point I've held virtually all of my money in bitcoin. We are talking having $10,000 in cash, and the rest in BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:02:27
Did you buy a full coin? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:35:06
Dude, lol. We are still at $9,000+. A few weeks ago we were at $5,500. This is Bitcoin, my dude. Without a correction, we are in complete mania. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:02:02

@_date: 2017-11-28 03:25:45
I wouldn't be selling amounts of bitcoin that large if I were you. At least where it's traceable. You're likely to give yourself some headaches regularly moving around amounts that large.
I have known a few people who have bought 100k in coin a week in person though. All you have to do is find someone who is selling that much. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:02:46
Buy coin in cash off of people. You can probably buy 20k in btc a day, so long as you pay a small premium, maybe 5%. 
You can even set up on localbitcoins as a buyer, and buy coins for a 5-10% discount off of people who want to sell. You can probably purchase around $10k per day from people.
Don't register with your real name, and all you have to do is withdraw the coin each time you buy some. Or just have them send it directly to your wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:12:56
That's solid. It sucks that coinbase isn't reliable though. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:41:47
Are you for real? Yikes, dude. YIKES. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:58:22
Just go buy your coin in person. You can either contact sellers on localbitcoins, or you can set yourself up as a buyer. If you set yourself up as a buyer you can actually charge people a 10% fee just to sell you coin.
So if they want to sell you $10,000 in coin, you get $11,000. You can actually turn around and sell it on an exchange if you really want to.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:02:14
There are people who will sell you coin. I used Circle in the past, but they no longer sell coin.

It’s funny, I read this and watched a GTR worth roughly what I lost in BTC drive by.

Unless you have those beautiful long term cap gains, then you owe substantially less. Thank you, daddy.

I’m salty as fuck that I can’t use a bitcoin credit card anymore. Sometimes I wish we hadn’t gone on this crazy price run.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:18:27
It’s funny, I’ve never used an exchange in my life and yet all these people keep bitching about exchanges.
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:53:34
I should've taken more gains at 20k, but I ended up not having time to really sell my coin. I was lucky that I took out 120k before the crash started. Still lost 100k. I may buy in again, but jesus. I knew this was coming, I just didn't think it would be this soon. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:46:26
Now you get it. I hope your alts work out. I figured BTC was gonna take a shit after I learned about tether. Got all my friends to actually cash out at 12k or so. Most of them had Ether. My friends all took huge gains while I only get my lmao 4x gains instead of 8x gains.
I know I've made a lot of money from this, but still. Losing 100k in value in a matter of weeks has been brutal. I hope we go back to $1000 levels, so the price is steady and I can buy/sell BTC for a profit. Rather than riding this fucking roller coaster. I'm glad you didn't buy lmaoRIPPLE. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:45:58
Yes, yes it is.

@_date: 2018-02-21 21:22:48
That's what I've essentially done. I do not regret it. I suggested my friend cash out when he had gone from $2000 in ether, to $12,000. I told him the market was going the crash but unfortunately I had already lost a lot. He made a fat profit, but fucking bought back in at $8000 (but bought btc this time). It kept dropping, he held, but instead of making $10,000 in profit in a few days, he made substantially less. 
I've learned a lot from the giant run up and massive crash, mainly that the price of btc is overvalued. The market actually does need some form of regulation to keep it from having these boom bust cycles where people can lose their entire life savings in a month. 
I've fortunately learned from this.

@_date: 2018-02-05 16:26:58
Truth, I lost 100k, and started to sell as we dropped. I held through almost all the other drops. I could tell this was different though. At least I made well over 100k in a few months.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:06:36
Rip bro. I lost 100k already. I hope you realized some of your gains man. I at least pulled out six figures so if it tanked to nothing I would be fine.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:48:15
Good luck on those alts. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:11:32
Haha, holy shit man. Good luck.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:00:11
I wish I had sold in December, but I couldn’t find enough folks to buy it in person. Never sell online. 
Guess we gotta peace out for awhile before cryptos make a come back. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:06:22
I meant to say that I never sell online. I don’t want all my wallets being connected to me. In hindsight, I would switch to monero, transfer to another monero wallet, switch to fresh bitcoin wallet. 
Not everyone loves taxes.
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:45:42
Well, it just turned out that ether was much more volatile than BTC, that's all. I made $50,000 during that 2 day period where ether shot up to 500, then almost lost all of it when ether started to dump. Came out with a net positive, but I switched back to bitcoin and didn't look back.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:15:51
Yes, yes it is. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:51:14
Good luck.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:44:54
Stay skeptical, I have like 3btc left after I sold mostly before the crash. I believe in bitcoin but not in the price. This whole sub is about getting rich quick. I might start buying again soon, but I also don’t trust the ecosystem right now. That gigantic crash and borderline freefall was a bad sign. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:10:44
That's good though, no one should be able to buy BTC on credit. That inflates the value and creates issues.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:04:43
Smart decision.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:03:41
Wait until it drops below 5k. BTC is still dropping. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:10:51
Exactly, dude.
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:43:36
Yeah, that's true. I really wish I had done other things though. I changed my life now, and I'm the happiest I've ever been. Hopefully I will reach that 600k.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:07:17
This is true. Tether is a serious problem whether or not they’re pritning fake money. This is why I started cashing out. It doesn’t feel like this situation has a strong a floor.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:46:21
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:21:04
Yeah, I am a lot more centered now. This hasn't really influenced my lifestyle in a big way, but losing 100k at 23 is pretty wild. It was a bit of a knock on my confidence to be honest. But, shit happens. I feel like the volatility has taken a few years off my life, so I'm going to probably stay out of the market for awhile. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:25:24
This is a risky move. Remember that you are gambling and could very easily get stuck in really shitty positions. I'm holding over 100k in BTC right now, and I did the same thing as you with Ether. All was well until it wasn't, and the stress from the situation was beyond absurd. 
Be careful. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:33:00
Made me lol
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:34:09
I agree with you. I do love bitcoin as a currency, and cryptocurrencies in general though. I made fat gains, but also lost a lot when it came crashing down. Now I’m being smarter with my money. The second I make bitcoin from my websites I sell it off. I’m tired of gambling with my future. 
I don’t like seeing something that I value as a currency just used as an investment or gambling vehicle. Tbh I think the price threads indicate there are a lot of people who don’t care about its value as a currency. Especially the HODL people. 
Bitcoin dropping only set me back a couple months, but that’s still 100k that I don’t have now. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:14:21
I buy stuff with it all the time. That’s why I both loved and hated the price run. I just want transactions to be cheap and almost instant so I can buy more shit with btc.
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:23:08
Seems like a normal sell off to me. Chilling at $5,650-$5,700 after a tumultuous night isn't really concerning to me.
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:45:11
I spent somewhere around 115 bitcoin this year....
Fucking $600,000 in BTC, and I sold at the worst times.
However, I changed my life and am no longer severely clinically depressed, so I have $100,000 in coin. Could be worse. 
I could have retired for the next two decades and jerked off all day. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:42:21
Nah, just regular BTC

I wasn't quite as educated as I should've been, I had a bunch of friends die and picked up a nasty xanax habit. So I don't really remember most of the decisions I made, or why I made them.
