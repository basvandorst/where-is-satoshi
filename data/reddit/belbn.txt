You just answered your own question. There are a bunch of different factors, one being bulk discounts. The stuff could be worth 40k, but he could have bought it for anywhere from 20k-40k. This was essentially my reason behind giving a ballpark figure. I'm sorry for any confusion.  
  
The difficulty was doubling every two weeks. He may have never made back the cost. I just calculated about $4000 a month running at 30GH/s. That's 5-10 months to break even, assuming it doesn't get much harder during that time. I don't suggest you even bother reading this, it's just not worth it.

Probably more. Mining was pretty profitable 2-3 months ago though. I wouldn't even consider it now.

Gravedigger. What are you talking about?
@_date: 2011-06-19 20:06:03
I think so
@_date: 2011-06-16 00:18:48
Nice. Assuming you'll run about 30-50 GHS? 
  
This setup will earn, lets see, &lt;$100 a day at 8 million difficulty? I was going to do something similar, then I saw the global hash rate graph at a nearly vertical line going up. Scary.

I think you run 2 terminals with -device 0 and 1

Nice to see you're using dotcloud. I love them!

Simply browse to the URL for the data portion.
Sending the POST variables can be achieved via sockets or one of the many libraries.

I don't see senators worried about prepaid credit cards or Paypal. You can use any number of methods to buy illegal goods, but do the majority of people? No.
@_date: 2011-06-16 01:43:55
Probably 20-40k

Ok, $30,194.99 is the exact price. Why do you need an exact value? Simple answer: A lot. Too much.

My best guidance at the moment. Don't mine. Global mining has increased 10x in the last month. There are only a limited number of bitcoins available. You'll soon see mining is not profitable at all in the coming months.

    $hashTime = ((float) $difficulty) * (pow(2.0, 32) / ($hashRate * 1000.0)) ;
    $powerCostPerYear = 365.25 * 24.0 * $powerConsumption / 1000.0 * $electricityRate;
    $blocksPerYear =  (365.25 * 24.0 * 3600.0) / $hashTime ;
    $coinsPerYear = $blockCoins * $blocksPerYear;
    $revenuePerYear = $coinsPerYear * $conversionRate;
    $profitPerYear = $revenuePerYear - $powerCostPerYear;
    $netProfit1st = $revenuePerYear - $costHardware - $powerCostPerYear;
    if ($profitPerYear &lt;= 0) $breakEvenTime = -1;
    else $breakEvenTime = $costHardware / ($profitPerYear / (365.25 * 24.0 * 3600.0));

I've gotten a bunch already. Fuck these guys.

Great. We need bad news in the press about btc.
@_date: 2011-06-15 14:54:42
Difficulty just doubled. It will keep doubling. Zillions of people are "starting" up mining. I'm voting no at the moment.
