They are priced in dollars and that amount is converted to BCH at the checkout. I bought two orders yesterday for the same items - same dollar amounts but different amount of BCH. 
Not sure what Bitmain use as their exchange rate source though.

So just think if that goes up to 0.05 you're $50 up. It's relative to your starting point.
Of course don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

Coinbase allows you to buy immediately with your debit/credit card for a moderately high fee - if you're looking to drop a lot of money then go with something like bitstamp or coinfloor where you need to register and be approved but the fee structure is a lot better.
Once you have your BTC you can transfer them to a wallet you prefer.
Also in terms of coinbase, use their GDAX platform to make trades as again it's lower fees.

In short - Coinbase. Sign up and buy. It's a wallet so they stay there for you.

It's stated on their site here
but I can't see any official statements to back that up

Coinbase charge 3.99%. This is pretty much instant buy. However if you're not looking to make an instant purchase and can wait for verification, transfer time and receipt then there are other options.
Bitstamp for a SEPA transfer charge nothing (so you pay only your bank's fees and the exchange rate - this varies between banks and days so check your bank).
Coinfloor allow GBP deposits and charge £5 + 0.38%. This could be cheaper if it is less than your bank's fee total.
Edit: I'm sure there are lots of other options with other platforms, just stating some examples.

If you use Coinbase, their GDAX exchange is significantly better in terms of the fee structure.
