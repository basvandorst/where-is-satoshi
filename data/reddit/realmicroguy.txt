Regardless of how the invoice was sent, someone was going to be cheated.
If the BitPay exchange rate was broken (as they stated), a USD invoice simply would have passed the "screwing" along to the customer by forcing him to pay an inflated amount of BTC.

Most of my customers prefer being billed in Bitcoin (BTC). I don't think expecting a fair exchange rate while also pleasing the customer is unreasonable.

Trying to decide which PSU took me about 2 hours. There were so many ATX size units to choose from I couldn't make up my mind. In some cases identical units had different prices. Then my bitcoins were stored in an online wallet and the maze of email confirmations and SMS authentications was mind blowing. The payment finally confirmed with only seconds left on the intimidating payment count-down timer. I'm really happy with the purchase and was just venting a little. lol :)

If this store will be cashing checks, he may want to look into the costs of getting a "money transmitter" license. The new FinCEN rulings suggest that any US business dealing with Bitcoin could fall under that definition.

Cryptsy has one of the best customer care response times that I've personally seen in any industry as evidenced by their prompt reply to this thread. The cryptocurrency community is fortunate to have this exchange.
@_date: 2014-11-23 02:07:30
Yes. The majority of users in the Bitcoin reddit don't like altcoins and are taking their dislike out on an exchange that's about 100 times more reliable and stable than most Bitcoin exchanges.
@_date: 2014-11-01 02:33:20
True. And if the US continues to ratchet up the regulatory oversight, there will be a lot more companies running in the future.

I think Gavin and his crew of merry men should fork Bitcoin INTO Goldcoin (GLD)! hehe :) :)

Now that FinCEN has made it possible for all Bitcoin businesses to be defined as "money transmitters", Mr. Lawsky sees the opportunity to gain political capital by easing up on Bitcoin since it's already been killed by the FEDs. aka, There's no need to beat a dead horse.

Most merchants that integrate Bitcoin, also deal with Fiat.
From the article linked below:
Andrew Ittleman, an attorney at Fuerst Ittleman David &amp; Joseph, PL, further stressed the implications of the rulings, suggesting that they perhaps are a troubling sign for how the industry could be treated by the agency as a whole.
"Based on my reading of these documents, I'm not sure if there's a limit to the breadth of [the MSB] definition," he said. "It seems to me that, according to FinCEN, any company that's dealing with bitcoin is a money transmitter, and I don't know if I could have said that before before I read the payment processor note."
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:39:24
Yes, I would have been satisfied, while my customer would have been cheated by having to pay a higher number of bitcoins.
Either way, someone was going to get screwed! :/

When did the blockchain get renamed "block database?"

Great article. I think the future can be found not only in bitcoin but in decentralized cryptocurrencies in general. If you look at where the major innovation is emerging today, it’s coming out of altcoins, like Goldcoin (GLD) for example, which is about to release a new multi-threaded java daemon and cross-currency client.

I think this word "pump" means promote. Yes, I am promoting Goldcoin and Bitcoin together. This conference will be 50% dedicated to Bitcoin and 50% dedicated to Goldcoin.

The reason the price is falling is fundamental. Each new merchant that integrates bitcoin as a payment option becomes a BTC auto seller.

I think the BitLicense is a non-issue now that FinCEN has said that practically anyone dealing in Bitcoin is a money transmitter. Lawsky's hammer looks like a tiny rubber toy compared to that sledge hammer that just fell.
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:29:23
This issue is unrelated to price volatility. The exchange rate they used was wildly incorrect. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:17:02
Exactly. I could understand if they had been a couple of points off in the rate of exchange. But this was a wild difference of nearly 10%!

This PSU is for a dying relic of a machine. It's actually the machine where my local wallet is stored. :)

Yes. Apparently these news banks are in the planning stages now:

Transaction fees are skyrocketing. Paypal is looking more attractive to merchants and customers.

Because keeping private keys (by yourself) is troublesome, one of bank's services in the future will be keeping private keys for customers. They won't need to create their own currencies if they can convert enough of the population over using this system.
The customer visits bank and is provided a "bank account" which is a managed address on the bitcoin blockchain. The customer can still have personal addresses, but this address will be secured and guaranteed by the bank and have attached banking services.
