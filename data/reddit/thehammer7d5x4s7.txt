3) insert the quote (the only legit information) 
4) draw your own conclusions and speculate, speculate, speculate! 
5) give the article a misleading title that is speculative and a giant lie.

This is the 2nd time a government has auctioned off bitcoins they have seized. For the government to sell them off it means they don't view bitcoin as being completely illegal. This is good for bitcoins reputation.

Can anyone tell me what Apple Pay or Google Pay offer over a regular credit card? As far as I know you just link you credit card and then pay by tapping your phone. Is that all it offers? You don't need to take your credit card out? 
And for this convenience you provide Google or Apple access to your purchase history. I don't see what the attraction is here.

No. They hold bitcoin which is split among the investors. This is normally done for gold and barrels of oil etc. Since this is the only bitcoin fund available on NASDAQ it is trading at a premium. 
Normally what would happen if you were invested in this fund you'd sell and buy bitcoin instead, this in turn would lower the price to the same as the actual price of bitcoin.

You can send bitcoin from a wallet to one of the inputs used for that transaction at a high fee.

The "seed" is the mnemonic phrase. 
Once you have a wallet setup and they give you the seed. Write this down, on pen and paper (no electronic copy). Put this in a sealed envelope somewhere safe. Best practice is a private safe at a bank, but for your amount that's not feasible. Hidden away in a draw that nobody else has access to is an okay alternative. 
With the wallet, it will have it's own password or PIN, this can be something you memorize. 
Now when you want to use your wallet to transfer funds, you'll use your password. 
If your phone breaks, you can restore your bitcoin using your mnemonic phrase. There are many different wallets which will accept this seed, so the seed is the easiest way to backup. 
Be sure to keep your seed hidden, because if someone finds this they can get access to your coins. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:37:41
Great answer. From this I gather it will still take a while for developers (most of who work for free) will implement easy to use accessible features. The protocol supports it and that's the main takeaway. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 08:12:14
I've never heard of them I'm sure it's fine. But you should enjoy the technology a little. Install either Bread wallet (Apple) or Mycellium (Android) and transfer it across. 
You'll be given a 12/24 word seed to backup your wallet (bitcoin) so losing your phone or transferring to a new phone will not be an issue.

I think discussions about this are more important than price, so please don't dismiss the OP. 
I understand segwit allows the some information of the transaction to be omitted from the block (the hash). How many more transactions per block does this allow us? 33% more?

If you have a very small amount of BTC then just use a wallet on your PC or phone. 
The recommendations for hardware wallets, multisig, paper backups etc. The most secure way to use BTC and are recommended only because these options are available. Your bank doesn't allow you to create a transaction offline and publicly send out a hash of a transaction. You can with BTC and you control your own money, which is why people are so strict. 
Using BTC on your phone is fine, if it's a small amount.

7 hours later and I now have 4 confirmations. Wish I'd known this sooner. I can conclude when sending to your own address or when time doesn't matter, use the lowest fee possible. However when time is important, then use the recommended fees (as long as they aren't insanely high).

But being serious now. You can send from non-segwit (legacy) to segwit addresses with no issues. And you can send from segwit, to a legacy address. You can even send from a legacy or segwit address to multiple outputs made up of legacy and segwit addresses.

I'll tell you that I have a Trezor which I keep, and a phone wallet for everyday use. 
I'll keep a small amount on my phone and if I need more I'll transfer it from my hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 12:26:32
I should rephrase, I meant the direct control of private keys being too technical. A hardware wallet will have an easy interface for you to use. 
I can't recommend a software based wallet that could do this for you as I haven't used one during a fork. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 08:19:01
Just moved some from my Trezor. Which now had custom fees :D
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:54:22
Should've been more clear. 
I created s Samourai wallet. Backed it up. Wrote down the public key. Deleted the wallet. Installed again and restored my Mycellium wallet seed. Sent it to my previously created wallet. Deleted again and restored the original Samourai wallet. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:23:23
I believe Samourai uses its own seed a bit differently to Mycellium so I did this. 
* Create a new Samourai wallet and keep the backup somewhere. Keep a copy of the address it gives you. 
* uninstall Samourai 
* install Samourai and use your Mycellium seed. 
* send all your bitcoin to the address you noted down before. Give it a 20 satoshi per byte fee. 
* uninstall, install and restore your original Samourai wallet seed. 
* once the BTC is in and confirmed you can delete your Mycellium wallet.

Yes 
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:33:01
For sure especially if you are spending that kind of money you want it to look good. I actually wanted to wait for the new trezor. However I figured it would take a while, may be expensive too. But ultimately it'd because Trezor has been around for a few years already and has been vigorously tested which is why I feel safe using it.

A fork refers to when they take the code of one piece of software and create a new version based on it. 
Basically there are a few different ways people want BTC to develop, so a group are taking the current software, transactions, coins etc. Cloning it and tweaking it to have new features. 
This will result in 2 blockchains, the current BTC bitcoin and a new crypto currency 
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:29:12

You sure about that? It's a separate chain. I thought they issue is you could accidentally send coins to a 2x address instead of a btc address, as they'll look the same. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:04:02

I don't fully understand the concept of replay action. I'm guessing when you spend coins on The BTC chain someone can use the transaction hash to spend the same coins on the other chain, ie. Transferring from the same inputs to outputs? Is that roughly what's happening? 
Either way, if both chains were stay active and one doesn't die off. Will this be chaos for BTC?

@_date: 2017-10-13 14:09:41
Basically buy bitcoin, then move it to a wallet which you control the private keys. 
For $500 storing it on a non-rooted or non-jailbroken phone with a wallet like Mycellium with a backup is good enough. That's the easiest "set it and forget it".

No need to mention spammers. Just mention the good guys 
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:53:24
Getting in before the fork gives you access to new coins on the new chain too. 
ie. You'll have the original bitcoin + the same amount of the new coin. 
EDIT: during a fork one of the chains is meant to die off but that hasn't been happening. But you will find a superior chain and a minority one. ie. One that's worth a lot more.

@_date: 2017-10-13 08:44:03
Hahahaha we were all new once. 
Gemini is an exchange where you can purchase BTC (bitcoin) and ETH (ethereum). 
You need to use the traditional banking system to purchase bitcoin, they'll also need to verify you which could take a couple of days. 
Once that's done its best to store them in a hardware wallet (such as a Trezor). To keep them secure from hackers. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 09:13:35
Hard to tell at this stage. Things can change. 
Essentially the people who are for the fork should just go use Bitcoin Cash. On the Bitcoin chain we'll have lightning networks at some point which will make bigger blocks not essential. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 07:31:24
Did you backup your wallet too? 
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:22:43
A piece of paper which has the private and public keys printed on there. This use to be the safest way to store bitcoin. You would the "sweep" the keys into a wallet. 
A hardware wallet now provides better security and a lot more convenience and is the superior option.
@_date: 2017-10-07 12:10:11
If you do it correctly you will (ie. Manage your own private keys, and keep them secure). A hardware wallet would be the most secure and convenient. If that sounds too technical you could leave then on Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:50:41
Make sure you test your wallet first do you know how to use it correctly and confidently. Send a small amount first and the the backup/restore procedure. Once done you can transfer your actual coins. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:22:16
You can do this through some type of contract. I'm not too familiar with where though.

@_date: 2017-10-14 17:36:34

This is like a stock split. However once the split happens you'll get both sets of coins on each chain. 
Eg. Own 1 whole btc, you get to keep that and will get 1 coin on the new chain. The dollar value of these can change due to market forces. 
Keeping it on Coinbase is not ideal. However they've said they'll support both chains. So you'll be okay for this fork. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:07:37

@_date: 2017-10-05 04:29:40
Well done! Fees can be high, but when making a decent purchase it can be better to have a higher fee so your transaction can be confirmed quickly. If I'm sending something to myself I use the lowest fee possible, if it's a purchase which needs to be confirmed I'll go with a slightly higher fee so it gets a confirmation. 
If you use android Mycellium let's you set fees. Samurai is good too, but it's in alpha. Setting your own fee is an advanced feature so be careful.

The site hosting the wallet could potentially have access to your keys. Having said that I know some sites where the wallet can only be accessed by the user.

Sure. Though I doubt the price is that high on BTCMarkets. But if it sells that high there go for it. And re-buy at a cheaper price, rinse and repeat. The more people that do this will cause the prices to eventually become equal.... However I doubt the coins would actually sell for that much on BTCMarkets.

Easy to understand chart. Correct me if I'm wrong but this is what I'm assuming. At the 2MB Hard Fork, if it doesn't reach 100% it will split. Let's assume 90% of miners back 2MB. I'm assuming this will result in 2 chains, one with 90% of the mining power, another with 10% of the mining power. However realistically speaking, once 1 chain has a majority of mining power, the others will 'jump ship' essentially having 1 true chain.

I neglected you advice and read on.. They recommend blockchain.Info as a wallet provider!

You can use the search on reddit to find this question has been asked a lot. You aren't special. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:11:31
Nice question! I asked something similar years ago. What was a real mind fuck is since it generates a random private key, it's possible for this new random address to be an existing address. Hence you would gain access to someone elses bitcoin!
This is called an address collision and the probability of this happening is statistically impossible.

I bought some a month ago to see what it was like. I guess it's hard to compare on such a small amount of time, but it seemed more secure. 
I just sold those coins for BTC again. I know a lot about btc in terms of wallets and securing coins correctly. Better to be invested in something you know, then something you don't. 
@_date: 2016-07-28 10:22:39
I actually downloaded it an hour ago and looked at it. Looks really decent and easy to use. I'll use it the next time I have to replenish my BTC. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 16:59:35
Geeze after years people are still asking basic questions.

A RP nightmare? That's a little extreme don't you think?

"older people" right? Because young people just get it.

Blockchain is not a real wallet.

I'm surprised that you think you won't find a buyer. What city are you in? 
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:16:18
LOL where did you hear you'd make 0.5 btc a month? 
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:47:18
I'd only trust my coins with English. It's much too risky to use some other language. /s
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:10:40
Exactly right. Addresses have checksums and are well at protecting against this sort of thing. So much so, that recently I'm quite comfortable simply typing in an address, when copying/pasting isn't an option. 
You are far more likely to type in an invalid address than you are to type in a valid address which you don't own. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 00:43:58
LOL - sounds like you're out to make a quick buck and playing with fire. 
@_date: 2016-07-28 04:08:24
Only started hearing about Bitsquare recently, so a few basic questions. 
I understand the bitcoin portion can all be done online, but how do you transfer fiat? Meet in person, online bank transfer? Do you deal directly with the other person, or is there a way to anonymise this? 
I assume it only runs on PC's with no phone app yet, as it's still new. 
Also does it use any encryption, or other security features? I'm keen to check it out when I get home. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:12:32
Hahahaha

We already have a tax file number, medicare number, my gov ID... I'm all for privacy, but the list goes on... Oh and the census is taking place in 29 days.

What's transfer wise? 
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:39:25
Yeah I agree. Scummy company. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 11:41:03
Thanks for the tip, I tried that and it brought up a Wallet with 0btc in it. I'm still running vigorous tests on my Trezor before I actually put it to real work. I'm guessing I got the seed wrong. I'll have to start over with a new seed to confirm. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 02:31:00
Just get it into Electrum (pc) or Mycellium (Android). Or get it into a paper wallet/hardware wallet if you're really paranoid. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 09:44:01
I've used r/Microsoftsoftwareswap and bought Office 2016 Pro which works well. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 10:25:42
Someone explained it to me by saying there are people out there who want their transactions on the blockchain and are willing to spend the money. If I can't afford the $3 then there is a lot of big money involved. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 14:47:14
I've been using paper wallet addresses years. I recently got a trezor and it's great. But I think paper wallets are as good. As long as you can keep it secure.

Awesome! Was going to work out a better wallet when I had time, but happy to keep using them. I never upgraded, so will never see an ad and can forget this ever happened. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 08:36:36
I had a look a while back and could only see tacky items I wasn't interested in. Are people selling digital goods, 2nd hand goods etc. What about selling drugs on here? 
I know it's early days, but would love to see more stores and see where this will go. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 12:50:50
I don't think you've done enough reading if you are asking this question.

I didn't even know Electrum was available on Android. But that sounds fine too.

Which media companies? I'd like to see some sources.

The author is having a cry about some stores needing you to swipe your card, because they don't have the newer insert card terminals with the chip. 
Meanwhile in Australia and the rest of the developed world we've all moved onto tapping our credit card on the same terminal... 
As a kid I use to lookup to the US as 'The' example of a developed country, but unless you are rich, it is a backwards country.

Is that you? Niiiice ;-)

Something I've wondered about when all coins are mined.. Miners will rely on transaction fees. But what if a lightning network or off-chain transactions happened? Wouldn't the fees be extremely minimal and miners won't have any incentive to keep the network secure? 
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:52:22
This is true too and I used this for the first few years and am pretty grateful. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 03:33:55
I've searched all over and an option doesn't exist. You can only have wallets derived from the one seed. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 08:59:31
That's true. I know addresses beginning with a '3' are used for other things like multisig.

Linux user here and there is no comparison when it comes to security of these OS's. 
Windows is closed source, when a hacker finds an exploit it can be used until Microsoft find it and patch it. 
With open source software, an exploit can be found by everyone at any time. There are more good guys than bad guys so a fix will quickly be deployed, if it wasn't already fixed during it's initial coding.
