Transferwise your money into bitstamp and then buy BTC at bitsamp

Well when I sent it through, I did it as a SEPA transfer but paid transferwise with my debit card instead of bank transfer so it was pretty much instant. I converted my money into Euros. Now I only have to wait a couple of days for the bank transfer from transferwise to bitstamp. Once transferwise have sent the money to bitstamp, they will automatically convert it into USD. There is a fee that is a small percentage to do this whole service but it is relatively not that much.
There are other quick ways like localbitcoins.com and paying in cash which works as quick as you can arrange to meet up with someone and give them the cash whilst they then transfer you the money on their computer in front of you which is what I did for my first purchase of BTC.
