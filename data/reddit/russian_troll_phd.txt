Gold was useless to cavemen. And their descendents, and their descendents still. Bitcoin is an 8 year thing.

67% upvoted. Good luck with that, because you'll need 75% of the vote for this to pass.

Let's hope they sell so I can be them in the future.

Yeah right. If people have 10000 Bitcoins and they sell them all at 100 million, they will have 1 trillion dollars. Dream on. 100000 is doable though.

Okay, can you please donate 10000 Etheriums to me?

The economy can handle millionaires and billionaires, but not hundreds of trillionaires. If banks fiat fails, the economy crumbles and Bitcoin paper wallets will be used for toilet paper. I'm not saying any of this will happen, but anything above 1 million dollars is just too absurd, especially for a coin that's built around so much hype and hodl types.
