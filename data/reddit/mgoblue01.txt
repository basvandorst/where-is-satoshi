No, It can’t in my opinion.

Doesn’t using a lot of different addresses increase your fees when you do move them somewhere else?  I got a Ledger for Christmas and when I moved from Electrum to it, it showed several different inputs, each from a different address.  Total of eight inputs and one output. I paid a good-sized fee, which seemed larger because I had several inputs.  Am I wrong?

Wash sale rules only apply to losses not gains. If you harvest a loss and then buy again within 30 days, you cannot claim the loss to offset gains.  If you sell for a profit it is always a taxable event, even if you buy back immediately. The new asset is based at its new purchase cost. The old asset is taxed for any profit above its basis.

I was not at all certain of that. I’ve ridden this roller coaster before. I’ve been here long enough to know that I can’t predict the behavior of the masses. I’m just glad it has. My 3.2 BTC could alternatively be worthless otherwise.

Thanks! It was a simpler time. Before the availability of no-credit private college loans increased the money supply available for college and thereby raised the price of college for everyone.

You would have to wait thirty days to rebuy to avoid the wash sale rules.

If it were physical like metals and stones, you’d be right. Even when it’s physical, markets suffer from irrational exuberance. I paid for college by trading and selling baseball cards when those little pieces of cardboard were “worth” a lot. They aren’t anymore though. There just wasn’t enough money to keep your value in cardboard, when that money was needed for food and mortgages and people wouldn’t take baseball cards to pay for those items.

Lol. There isn’t that much money in the world. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:37:35
Actually, it will be the people that get all of the money in any money system: the people that have the stuff that needs to be bought. If I have the chickens, you will give me the money for my chickens. If I make the iphones, you will give me your money for the iPhones. If you want to travel on my planes and boats, you will give me your money. If you want to wash, drink, eat or have a roof over your head, you will have to give away your money to get it. Capital begets capital.  
Doesn’t matter if it is called a dollar, a euro, a drachma, a doubloon or a bitcoin,  if you need something, you have to spend money.  If Bitcoin really becomes a currency, there will still be a 1%, and at least 99% of us won’t be in it.

I hope you’re right, but 21M coins at $100,000 each equals more than half the current world money supply. And no matter what, the fiat won't go away. If you increase the world's money supply by that much “quantitative easing” you can expect price inflation of Venezuelan proportions. Not sure what is better for us in the long run. 
I think $100,000 is a pipe dream. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:41:37
At this point, you’re correct.

When comparing to gold, it’s important to remember that precious metals are measured in troy ounces and troy pounds. The are only 12 troy ounces in a troy pound. So a pound of gold will always weigh less than a pound of anything that is not measured with the same system, even though a troy ounce weighs more than an avoirdupois ounce.

Not a governmental agency ...

They are not added to the M1 but certainly they are added to the GDP. They are certainly added to the economy. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:19:50
Change my mind then. Do the other kind of math and show me.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:18:40
A fraction for sure, but not a small one. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:46:58
And Bitcoin won’t replace fiat by the time there are.

Can I create a 24 word seed for a paper wallet I created with bitaddress.org offline? If I had the option originally, I didn’t do it.

And there isn’t enough currency available to liquidate that net worth, which is why money has value. People want it to the exclusion of others. If you increase the supply of actual money, the real value of that money is less. Because less is easier to come by, prices go up as more is needed to meet the same value. 
There is a big difference between what a penny is worth and what an actual penny coin contributes to the economy. A penny spent by me, and then by the receiver and then by the next guy is already worth three pennies. And that goes on and on. That’s what contributes to net worth. However, if you substantially increase the number of penny coins, they lose their value.

mBTC has no accepted pronunciation and would be difficult to adopt. I fear that it will force the lazy to call them “millibits” for short. Then the next step would naturally be to call entire coins “bits.”
Then we’ll all overpay for a shave and a haircut.

It appears that I do need to do better maths.  The total at $100,000 is 2.1 trillion, not the 21 trillion I was working with.  Still I believe the percentages are still really high.  I still don't think that $100,000 is reasonable.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:29:56
I saw a 40 trillion number myself. Even so, 21 trillion still increases the money supply by 25% using your research. Such an increase would still have a profound effect on prices.

Well that would be true for any stock as well. But the market cap is defined as he defined it.

I love the /s dripping from that comment.
