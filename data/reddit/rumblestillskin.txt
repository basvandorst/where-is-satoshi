Staking your bitcoin on the lightning network, once the technicalities are stripped away, is just moving your money from your savings account to your checking account. You are able to spend these staked Bitcoin, so they are fully available to be spent.

It is inevitable that the US dollar will eventually lose it's position as reserve currency. This is a great reason to allow Bitcoin to become the reserve so that another nation's currency does not get this advantage and place the USA at a disadvantage to that nation.

I think in a recession there will be some downward pressure on the price. To many people this is a long term play against the devaluation of currencies. There is also the chance money moves into Bitcoin due to it's value not being based on revenues.

Busted and illegal are not the same thing. The most likely downfall of Tether is news about a lack of reserves which will bring the price below $1. Exchanges will not stop trading because of this. Also if some legal action prevents the trading of Tether then this will only affect a single jurisdiction and Tether can still be traded on other exchanges not in that jurisdiction.
@_date: 2019-10-02 20:36:56
I don't care how the vendor handles. I just want to be able to pay them in Bitcoin.

I think if it becomes the global currency then it will be mostly large corporations and governments holding the sats and therefore would be less likely to lose these.

Lightning network is great but they need a way to have a reusable single address to receive any payment and not have to generate payment request. They also need to have some way to receive when your node may not always be online. Not everybody will host and always on node.

In my view, we require services form many large private(corporation) or public(government) organisations. The problem is large organisations like these will absolutely become corrupt no matter how much regulation is created.

I don't think you understand OP's concern. In Lightning network you need to have your node online or you can not receive a payment. A payment made while you were offline may not be there when you come back online. I believe people are working on this, but this is the situation at the moment.

The whole article is based upon a Reuters report that the Bank of England has "sought to clarify what Venezuela wants to do with the gold".

Why does accepting some other form of payment detract from accepting the one you want? They also accept credit card.
@_date: 2019-05-23 18:28:12
It appears to be Bitpay. Has there been any news that they will accept LN anytime soon?
@_date: 2019-05-24 01:56:20
It works great but it is still beta.

At the moment in many countries you would have to calculate capital gains tax on any Bitcoin used this way.

This is Bitcoin adoption. I don't care how another entity adopts it as long as I can use it how I want.

Because the dollar/pound/euro will become worth less over our lifetime and 1 million will mean something closer to what owning 100,000 is now?

If they are a “virtual payment instrument”, does this mean they are not subject to capital gains?

I am no fan of bcash. I think it will eventually fade since it is a lesser version of bitcoin. It will fail without active involvement from myself.

Many web wallets store an encrypted wallet and it only decrypted on your local browser so they have no access.

I think it may help keep the price more stable. The huge run ups in price followed by large drops will discourage many people and organisations from getting into the market. This past rise and fall have created enough FUD to delay actual adoption. Futures will not suppress the price if there is actual adoption and people wanting to buy to use the Bitcoin. A stable price with measured growth might actually bring about adoption in a shorter period of time than multiple bubbles.

Nope what?
@_date: 2019-05-28 18:21:40
Thanks. I was hoping for too much.

Atomic swaps I have seen with ethereum is sending the proof the Bitcoin was sent to the ethereum smart contract which sends you the ethereum, ERC20 token or ERC721 NFT. Not a good idea to do with other chains as the proof can be potentially faked.

So the payment is made in Bitcoin.

You are still trusting a third party writing the code. The way you don't is better than a web wallets but you still misunderstand what a web wallet does based on your comments.
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:43:19
I don't think you understand many web wallets.

I think Pomp would be the best guest for Rogan. Rogan likes to have undirected conversations and Pomp would thrive in that situation.
@_date: 2018-12-27 19:16:16
You wrote the code that controls your ledger?
@_date: 2018-12-27 19:55:42
I'd trust him, but I'll give you a better deal. I'll return $80. Trust me....
@_date: 2018-12-27 19:42:13
Now your comment is correct because you changed your argument and accepted my bullshit.
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:56:28
It is not the Bitpay card. It is Bitpay displaying a Bitcoin address to send Bitcoin to. Bitpay may then change that into fiat to give to AT&amp;T. But the transaction still occurs in Bitcoin.

No, just wondering what the status of the network is.

I recall an interview also where he said he had bought and he was positive about it.
@_date: 2018-12-27 19:21:32
So you are trusting a third party.
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:52:42
I think the recent populist movement is generally against big government and business setting up the rules for themselves and Bitcoin can be seen as a way to get out of that setup.

You should have downloaded the wallet yourself just like you backup any wallet.
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:22:50
Can you run a node?
@_date: 2019-05-19 21:26:58
What's your point?
@_date: 2019-05-24 02:46:52
You should only worry about your adoption.
@_date: 2019-05-23 21:22:03
Makes no difference to me.

I hope IPFS can help free the internet again.
@_date: 2018-12-27 19:37:42
There are open-source web wallets. Again your poor understanding comes into the conversation again.
