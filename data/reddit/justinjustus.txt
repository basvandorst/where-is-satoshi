Right. And lose 20%. And even if they did that why would you need Bitcoin for that? You realize there's this thing called bank accounts? You know you can cross the border while having a million in a bank account?
@_date: 2015-09-13 01:28:05
Ah positive thinking. What could go wrong. To the moon!
@_date: 2015-09-13 00:03:29
Did you just downvote me?
Anyway, again i'll ask: how does Bitcoin make travelling with gold or silver possible?
@_date: 2015-09-13 18:09:39
Reefer? Seriously?
@_date: 2015-09-13 21:13:37
It's working fine for you so there can't possibly be a problem for anyone else! 100k unconfirmed transactions we just ignore!
Perfect Bitcoiner logic. Didn't expect anything else. 
Denial. On a whole new level. Amazing to watch. 
@_date: 2015-09-08 20:40:24
Huh? What makes you think there should be machines like that all over the place. About 7 billion people don't use Bitcoin and don't plan using it either. Why would they need Bitcoin atm's?
Posts like this baffle me. Like you're completely out of touch with reality. 
@_date: 2015-09-13 10:33:27
This was about crossing the border, remember?
@_date: 2015-09-13 15:23:44
How does Bitcoin make crossing the border with gold and silver easier?
@_date: 2015-09-12 22:51:05
I take it you put all your money Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-09-13 02:01:31
I've read about blood in the streets about 50 times now in the last 1.5 years. Maybe you peope should stop using that term. 
@_date: 2015-09-14 00:58:01


Uh and when exactly will that happen? None of these countries did anything for Bitcoin so far. 
@_date: 2015-09-12 23:17:58
People who own gold and silver want gold and silver. How will Bitcoin "solve" this exactly?
@_date: 2015-09-13 01:50:56
So when i ask a question you don't like you start foaming from the mouth, go through my post history, downvote me and tell me to go away?
Wow. Just wow. 
@_date: 2015-09-13 21:49:22
Good thing Bitcoiners are into Bitcoin for the fundamentals and not to become rich quick. At least that's what this sub keeps telling me. 
@_date: 2015-09-13 17:53:00
That guy is bat shit crazy. And a total scumbag. 
@_date: 2015-09-13 05:22:41
Because 50k is enough to cause a 100k unconfirmed transactions backlog. I realize how bad this sub wants to ignore that though. Because it's real bad. Like ridiculously bad. 
@_date: 2015-09-13 17:23:59
Don't worry. The free market will sort it out. 
@_date: 2015-09-13 23:14:07
Self awareness. 
The desperation and denial from you bagholders is insane. Just insane. One day when you admit your losses and get out of fantasy land you will see this. 
@_date: 2015-09-13 02:59:35
Bullshit. This is about crossing the border with gold or silver and the problems it might cause. Obviously if they wanted the cross the border without gold and silver that money would be in a bank account and wold cause no problem. No matter how you look at it Bitcoin won't solve anything in this story. Which you all fully realize and now hate me for pointing that out. 
@_date: 2015-09-13 22:46:02
And you're not in denial??
You really miss ANY sense of self awareness don't you? This is getting ridiculous. Just stop. You're making yourself look more ridiculous with every reply. 
@_date: 2015-09-13 00:25:32
Please tell me you're not older than 16. 
@_date: 2015-09-12 19:58:09


And you know this how?
@_date: 2015-09-14 00:42:50
We've seen several economies collapse over the years. Nobody gave a crap about Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-09-08 21:38:29
Yeah, people can't wait to turn their money into Bitcoin and pay with it on the farmers market. 
@_date: 2015-09-14 01:28:28
Wtf? What is Bitcoin supposed to do according to you? Just go up so you can get rich without working?
Why exactly would it do that? Because you want it to?
@_date: 2015-09-13 22:36:02
Stop hating the free market, you damn statist!
@_date: 2015-09-13 01:58:58
You really couldn't figure that out?
@_date: 2015-09-13 20:03:55
100k uncomfirmed transactions. What part of that don't you understand? This sub took the term denial to a whole new level. As if you people live in a different reality. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 01:18:49
Are you seriously pretending the stress test is a non-issue that affects pretty much no one?
I know there's a lot of denial of reality here but this is just too much. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 03:05:53


I'd never expected that from scammers. How rude of them. 
@_date: 2015-09-13 05:20:57
Wrong sub. 
@_date: 2015-09-13 02:08:31
The only? Would you say the 100's of alt coins would also be able to do that?
@_date: 2015-09-13 10:45:47
Well, that's easy. Put it in your bank account. Or Litecoin or Dogecoin. 
@_date: 2015-09-13 21:38:35
Why do you statists hate the free market so much?
@_date: 2015-09-13 00:26:50
How does that help people who want to cross the border with gold and silver?
