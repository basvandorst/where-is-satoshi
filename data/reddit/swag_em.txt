I think you're missing an order of magnitude or three...

I dunno man their proposals for fixing bitcoin seem pretty reasonable to me

I think a lot of people must have very different philosophies about what bitcoin should be. $20 to send a transaction defeats the point of bitcoin to me. Should bitcoin not be a useable currency and payment platform? What good is it if I cant buy a $3 coffee with it and not pay more than say 30 cents in fees ??
I only just stumbled into this debate and I feel like I'm taking crazy pills when I read both sides of the argument

The value of bitcoin is its low fees combined with be fact no one else can control your money is it not...I don't understand what you mean when you say on chain scaling is centralising, through what mechanism does it centralise ? Honest question I'm completely new to this debate

I do not understand either sides argument for all this. Surely some sort of middle ground is the best solution. 2 layer solutions seem to me to be the future, however I also see no harm in increasing block size. 
As it stands right now transaction fees are so high bitcoin is useless as a currency. What are valid reasons against bigger blocks? Hard drive space is stupidly cheap these days. If blocks were 1GB each I could store the past 5000 on my home computer no dramas at all, why not slightly increase the size to alleviate the full block problem while moving towards layered solutions as a longer term fix?
