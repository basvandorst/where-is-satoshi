Business man wants to pay for black people not to procreate instead of investing in them. Funny how we live in times where only conspiracy theorists would believe that.

The fool provides entertainment.  But if we look a little deeper it is often more than entertainment.  The fool gets to tell the truth, the hard truths that might cause trouble if anyone else tells them. The fool  can get away with telling the hardest truths just because he is a fool.

How as we established before all this stuff was told to everyone by Binney before. Also what fallout has there been since this was all exposed? Did anyone go to jail?




What if it was a deal with Russia? How do you know Snowden plans anything? How do you know he's not just doing what he's told. How do you know he's not created by the government to get in close to Julian Assange to assassinate him?

Don't I know it.
maybe there's rounds, first round is a vote out of 10 users, if just 1 vote says it's not spam then it goes into a second round of users who have voted historically trustworthy but only 5 of them. If 2 of them say spam but 3 of them say it's not, it gets posted.
Also maybe have it so you only vote on posts to subs you don't subscribe to. Someone who posts in cat photo subs probably wouldn't really have an opinion in one of programming subs.
@_date: 2015-10-10 18:26:09
Yeah well the mod is a censoring asshole, fuck him.
@_date: 2015-10-11 15:06:40


How, you're randomly assigned posts to mod?


I'm thinking no ownership of subs, you create a sub topic and people do with it as they may. You start a SJW sub and it gets filled with trolls, go to reddit. I'm somewhat of an anarchist and believe things will work themselves out. After a while the trolls would leave subs that they make fun of for other subs. Once and a while those subs might get revisited by trolls based on what's popular but eventually it'll even out.


Already done.


If I were smart enough to program a decentralized reddit, I would.
@_date: 2015-10-11 03:44:38
Staple a captcha on it to stop trainers. It's not per account, it's per post. Also maybe it tracks how many successful agree pools you're involved in so your account becomes more trusted.
If every post was randomly distributed you couldn't really have enough sock puppet accounts to make sure you were approving your own stuff. Sure at outset you could because the network would be small, but if it had a lot of users like reddit, it'd be impossible to post spam and hope enough of your sockpuppet accounts would receive to approve it.
@_date: 2015-10-11 06:07:43
Yeah except Binney wasn't in the CIA when he exposed the NSA.
That's why what Snowden did wasn't actually all that heroic, when you're under CIA protection you're not risking your life so much.
Why do you think he was sent to Russia? The CIA is international not national like the NSA is.
@_date: 2015-10-10 21:23:48
Meh, that's what a report spam/downvote system is supposed to fix. If a post has 10 report spam flags the system would remove it.
Don't over estimate the mod's job. They're easily replaced by a filter and a captcha. They want you to think they're guarding you from a bunch of spam, kind of like politicians.

Says a mod.
You guys made it about censorship when you told him to blur it.
@_date: 2015-10-11 03:48:29
So you're saying Snowden got a media circus just because he had data dumps?
@_date: 2015-10-11 03:26:22
Because it's satire of real life.
@_date: 2015-10-10 23:49:35
Well it depends, if it's ONLY titles links and comments it probably wouldn't be too bad. If you wanted it to be totally uncensored where you could upload images, videos, that sort of thing then yeah probably.
The way hard drive size is going I don't think there will be a "datageddon". I mean Data on star trek held 100,000 terabytes, which I believe I'll see in my lifetime on one drive.

How so? They see a position open in the NSA, say he worked at the CIA in the same capacity or better, vouch for him when he applies there.
He goes there to work, gets in nice and deep.
It's what the CIA does, I mean it's more of an undertaking to get a puppet government in to another country but they do it all the time. Who do you think controls ISIS?
The rewards were:
- They took the NSA down a notch
- They got access to the NSA spy system
- They got to get an agent in to a country they're at odds with
They're going to extract Snowden eventually, he's already talking shit about Russia, saying he'd rather be in an American jail than to be in Russia:
Which is exactly what you'd say about the enemy before getting out of there.

Someone once told me they had a friend in college whose feet stunk super bad and they went to the doctor and the doctor told him to stop using soap on his feet and the smell went away.

"Asked by reporters to establish his authenticity to ensure he is not some fantasist, he laid bare, without hesitation, his personal details, from his social security number to his *CIA ID* and his expired diplomatic passport. There is no shiftiness. Ask him about anything in his personal life and he will answer."
Notice how they say his diplomatic pass was expired but don't say his CIA ID was.
You can see he's been in the CIA on his wikipedia page:

@_date: 2015-10-11 03:33:06
Well maybe the new system has a new way of figuring out spam, maybe before you can submit a post or a comment in one sub, you're shown a submission from another random sub and asked if it appears to be spam.
@_date: 2015-10-10 23:30:42
Yeah there's a couple of projects that are SORT of like it, I think the problem is people have to run nodes to hold the info so things wouldn't update so hot and what if a node disconnects? Do more people have to opt to hold more data, that kind of thing.

Actually how it happened was Binney went to the CIA controlled media who wouldn't allow it to be reported. Which is even more evidence that Snowden is CIA. The whole story was cleared by the CIA because it was their agenda.


The public doesn't even know the CIA is involved in this. You proved that yourself when I dug up the information for you. If you're talking about the NSA, then yeah, they're tarnished in the eyes of the public but that was what the CIA wanted...
Besides pretty much all of the government has low public opinion. Opinions aren't really "harm". People going to jail for shit is actual justice. By your logic all the bankers were harmed for the 2008 mess they caused. Are any of them in jail? No.


Depends what kind of plot the CIA creates, kind of like "the Ecuadorian ambassador (who flew a detour to Cuba keeping the fedcoat's attention elsewhere)" part of the story you mentioned.
Also, apparently only 1% of Snowden's data dump has been released, what's the hold up on the rest of it? Also why were Snowden's glasses broken in every single photo that was taken of him after he got to Russsia? He couldn't get a new pair? Russia is a modern company, they have glasses stores all over the place.

He didn't expose anything William Binney didn't release before him.
Also, he didn't fuck over the CIA he fucked over the NSA. Which the CIA is at odds with.
