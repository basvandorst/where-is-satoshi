Why would you want to? Look at their track record. Historically, except for the current batch, all fiat currencies have gone to zero. Whoever controls the money controls the world...with Bitcoin, the people control the money, not some regime. Even gold and silver are being manipulated by them...

You vote with the money you use, everytime you use it. Use Euro/Dollar/Gold/Silver/Bitcoin ...you are voting for whatever you use. Every country needs to do what this OP is doing. Show and tell your friends and family, neighbor!

This is the greatest proof that you should exit the system, something that is now perfectly legal and will soon be impossible. There is not a specific reason for why all this is happening to only Cyprus. Most other coutries are in the same financial position or worse such as Spain. The whole goal is to get everyone it debt. Get the people in debt, the county in debt, the state in debt, the whole world in debt and then take over the world. Since you are a member of the county, the state, etc.... they say you are liable for all the debt, and they just sweep it from your bank account, to pay for all the debt they can't afford.

Mr Buiter warned that a haircut for private creditors “may be eventually required” despite the pledge of EU leaders that there would be no repeat of losses seen on sovereign bonds in Greece." -
