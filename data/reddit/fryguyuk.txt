He's talking about Ddosing the nodes, but he's in over his head. One cannot simply Ddos and blackhawk raid every node on the blockchain whilst others globally are switching on and do so have the ability to switch more on if any are compromised. 
Blocking the port won't do Jack globally to the utility of bitcoin for the majority of Earth, only the price in speculation. 
They can "forbid" banks to do this and that with bitcoin (shit he thinks the banks actually follow Gov guidelines!)
- It's been banned and cracked down on before, no success, removal of said efforts... Russians are buying BTC still
- The laws effect it country to country whilst it exists globally
- Large portions of the earth still don't use banks but have a mobile phone.

It was about awareness that Bitcoin exists by name and knowing it can be used as currency. Nothing to do with adopters or anyone buying into it. How many people know about gold as a store of wealth or the trade of oil, but don't actually possess any of these commodities physically or digitally. 
To put what your response simply it's "my opinion is that user-base has not grown exponentially"... you are right; but that wasn't my argument. After that though I argue that it is provably increasing steadily. If in 2016 sees an accelerated increase; will start looking more exponential from 2009 - 2016/17. Of course don't envision the "top" of this exponential is to happen any time soon remember it's a looooong curve upwards if the theoretic potential peak for Bitcoin is in the trillions market cap, so it makes sense that it 'looks' like simply a steady even slow increase over the last 2 years.
@_date: 2015-12-12 16:23:28
BTCs already been banned and unbanned and longer it exists the harder it will be to ban. It is already a massive feat to disrupt Bitcoin and if I'm not mistaken near if not completely impossible to "destroy" it in an instance without harnessing solar flares, we're just a little while off that level of tech.
BTC could get banned by the USA, UK, Russia China etc... still has a use for un-banked persons on the planet which would catapult it's cap well beyond that of paypals, as well as still being used by these countries just like the activity in China once they were cracking down on it.
They try to ban drugs and weapons everything globally, it works in some indipendant countries but overall a massive failure. Apply that logic to something that is not tangible, needs only an internet connection, and is safer to use anonymously than anything else the Gov has sought to outlaw.
Eugene just thought he had an opportunity to buy sub 200 with the bubble over a week ago, now it's volatile he want's the big investors to dump with some Gov related negative future speculation.
Side thought: Crypto is not controllable by Govs... hold up is really all the money in circulation in all the countries, all directly controlled without tussle by all the governments... not bankers and the bank owners... plans to bailout banks for their fuck ups and corruption are all plans created by the government itself in a system of perfect control?
@_date: 2015-12-13 17:08:51
Ok without giving you a lengthy response just think about it are more people going to invest in Bitcoin the higher the price is? Or the higher the price has been and how low comparatively it is now. Pre 2013 slump from 270 dollars to under 60 didn't see a user base decline.
Besides my point was the word of mouth and awareness of Bitcoin not the user base or price etc. 
I started thinking about this as I go to a monthly "Game Dev Meetup" where I've talked to 30+ very tech savvy chaps including some big names in various industries and none of them really have paid attention to Bitcoin yet, some have not read into it more than the name, some have never heard of it. I was amazed, not only by how fast they started clocking onto BTC when I explained what details I myself understand, but by the fact it still isn't a particularly well known "thing". When you've been inside crypto with so many it's easy to be blind to the expansive growth through simply awareness BTC has still to go, regardless of the 1200 dollar bubble. 
Remember to check the charts:

Aye that's the one, I wasn't in shock with it appearing, just the sum's they're using to do so, makes the overall market look miniature. Only adds to the overall point the price is undervalued for the sums involved. 
@_date: 2015-12-13 17:59:13
BTC price has been declining since the original "rush" to buy which saw 1200 dollars. The price however has spent more time above 250 than below 250, which was the high peak price from 2009 - end of 2014. We have also just recently broken out of this large downtrend from a market perspective. 
Demand for BTC only faulters under bad news, generally, according to all charts on blockchain, there has been increasingly more money, more everything rolling into Bitcoin even the last few months. It's how it works, people don't just keep buying something until it eternally goes up in value. Something drops in value and more people invest, the higher it has been before the tempting it is, the more times it rises from an opinion of "BTC is dead" the more confidence traders have with playing with the Volatility. 
Check out the volume on Huobi recently compared to anything when the coin saw $1200. I bet you it seems similar to the comparison of volumes seen just before the $1200 bubble and in 2012. (volume is the candles along the bottom, set it to 1W view and scroll out. Don't know if you trade &gt;.&lt;)

Possible spike
"Ongoing upward-trending extreme volatility"
That's how I'd sum up the effect the halving has, nothing more. Given the market: can absorb any Bitcoin that get mined, has undergone plenty of dumping cycles to cut down massive lucky bagholders and the usage of Bitcoin from can only increase and not decrease. 
tldr Future looks bright.

From a miner:
This won't make any difference to Bitcoin as a project, only the price from naive speculation. Panic mongering more over.
Innosilicon is a much better manufacturer anyway now. By a flipping mile as well.
I remember when KNC miner went under and had to sell all their equipment, liquidated everything - selling 2 chunks of 2000 bitcoin (could have been more) for something like $250 bitcoin price. Then a few years later the warehouses of miners they sold could have been turned on for the recent 3 month bullish christmas... they would have made more money daily than they ever did before.
It'll happen again!
My advice: buy as many liquidated miners as you possibly can even if they aren't profitable right now.

I think the best thing they can do for their nation is to encourage the population to get in on mining, making the hardware and GPUs more available (seems to be the case can still buy a lot of hardware from USA that just doesn't exist anymore in the EU).

Bitcoin's can be hacked themselves if we aren't talking the exchanges, but it takes a long time to do so, with current technology I've heard still over a year to hack a single bitcoin, if the price reached $30K+ then maybe somebody would work towards the risk, but it's a lot of effort to put in hacking wise to possibly come out with 1 bitcoin. I don't even know if it would be usable if said bitcoin which was hacked had been split up and used within that period...

Fall in line yes of course, that wasn't your argument though. You were saying governments were pointless. What will you build onto the ashes of a government? Governance over history has always been improving and becoming more fair. Unless you're unaware of the times of kings and queens executing who the see fit daily. Nowadays some political hit seems hard to pull off without repercussion. You can moan about the unfair governments of the world all you want. It's all down to the individuals inside the system and the damaging things they leave behind. The bad things are eventually corrected and the good things left by good politicians remain forever, for instance... the historic atrocity of mass slavery... we're living in a tiny fraction of human history where it isn't normal for most of the planet. The poetic aggression you write towards governments really points to misplaced anger. Should appreciate the improving world around you and if you don't, get off ya tosh and help improve it!

This is said a lot and I admit I've said it to others plenty, but it's been pretty much the best investment every few years for almost a decade... I think I'm starting to feel happy to tell people to invest a fair bit if they like, and starting to fomo about all the people mortgaging their houses to buy bitcoin... we call it dumb... but is it at all?? Best performing currency* every year. 
*comparing it to currencies

Not surprised, With the value of bitcoin and the size of the commodity overall it allows a very lucrative scheme producing a bubble and cashing in on market craziness through mastercard's expense. One day though, one day.

I think you can trace a lot of those actions down to the issue of the financial system, printing money, selling weapons to make more money. It's all business, and governments aren't entirely to blame when they're surrounded by huge companies doing backdoor deals. Some governments you can argue are worst than others. It's down to the individuals, plenty of countries admire their governance. Picking out certain countries with certain individuals in charge at a certain period, to argue that governments are pointless, well I don't need to finish the statement. Can you not actually picture a world without governments (and companies because they would be in charge without governments)... 
Do you really trust you neighbors that much? Not every person is a saint :P

Lets bring all the governments down and bitcoin bitcoin! If the governments crumble the electricity goes off, then the miners go off, then bitcoin die. If you hate your politicians so much then become a positive political figure... it requires lifting a finger though.

There's never any point selling Bitcoin frankly, just got to wait until you can use it day to day more than fiat

You've scaled it entirely wrong, the peak we're having is the equivalent "media phase"
It could also be the first sell off, that graph is a pattern but the width (time) can be different, picture it scaled 25% on the width what does it look like?

Hmm interesting thought actually, arbitrage among other things favours the fastest transactions. In a world with avenues of near instant transactions arbitrage between commodities / currency / anything will be faster and more competitive. It might have a volatile effect immediately with emerging tech but quite quickly will serve to stabilise said market around the globe when most traders get savvy :D... market stability is a gooooood thing.

How much was this to lose this? What leverage level was it? 
If it was on leverage it wasn't 120,000 dollars right? If it's a fraction of this, it's still a lot of money,
but consider that you could work and save this amount again let alone have it land in your hands spontaneously, don't give up on life!

Aye very true but the last halving people didn't know what a halving was. This time 4 years later I'm betting many traders in the world forgot about the halving and find out soon enough, but don't need to learn what it does.

I was in fact going to give Brexit as an example! It's a terrible example though, Brexit was in the news globally, in the UK the BBC avoid any kind of BTC article. Brexit effects multiple things BTC just itself.
With Brexit anyway, the £ wouldn't go up with a remain vote because nothing changes... So it's a safe bet for short. Regardless of that and the fact the option to trade and gamble was on the table with a crazy referendum in the first palce, nothing dropped until the actual event and the days of realisation afterwards.

HAH 
Yes because having your national currency as the global standard is completely fair on all other countries.
America is clearly the most deserving of this position miles ahead of all the others. Just look at what amazing things they've done on their near trillion dollar military budget. Great things.... . great things. ..

Nah not many of their traders. Small capital traders obsess over information because it has to lead to the big bucks...
The big money traders just look at charts and news on the day, unless a specific BTC fanboy. It's just a game at that point. 
If the news hits big tomorrow in China it'll be great, depends on how much hype there is on the floor so to speak.

oh noes, what is that, like a 0.3% fee? oh noes
if bitcoin was 10x the price, you'd be sending 10x less, and it would cost you $8.5 now with the equivalent network strain
