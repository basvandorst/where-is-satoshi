I do freelance work to make money. Some programming. Some security work etc. And that's not pocket change or my monthly earning. It was my lifetime savings. And it was finally amounting to something, as Bitcoin price is soaring. I got greedy, and now I'm royally fucked. :)

It is. :(

Haha, another really valid point. :) I should have thought about this I guess!
Do you have other suggestions? I would love some!

Yes, I know. I'm familiar with hosting prices, but the objective is to provide some service in exchange for money. And not to get money for free.

I am a student. I felt a certain greed when I learned I can earn a profit off those Bitcoins. The scammer gave me a cheque with 5% premium on $6500 worth of Bitcoins, about 14.96BTC when I sent them to him.
I tried to en-cash the cheque and the bank told me the drawer stopped the check. I asked about a remedy, but I was told it's going to be difficult to get anything done.
India is a country where you can't have justice. Not unless you're already powerful, in which case everybody will try their very best to help you.
That's why I'm trying to earn them back.

Not a problem with Bitcoin, afaik. More like extreme stupidity from my end. I'm a living example for why you shouldn't be greedy in life.

I used LBC to transact the bitcoins into scammers address. It is an LBC internal address. That is why I didn't post it on the website.
What other options do I have? None.

That seems like a very sensible suggestion. Will keep it in mind, thank you! :)

Haha, well put. :) Desperation and skill can't be compared. Or maybe they can. I was desperate to make money. But that doesn't mean I suck at pentesting! 
Really well put though! :D
@_date: 2015-12-25 17:42:36
Absolutely! Send me your email address, and I'll send you a copy of my resume! :)
Thank you very much!

He said that he needs another 10 BTC in order to complete the contract, otherwise I'd loose my first investment (14.96BTC). I felt I had no option. It seems so obvious now that I think about it.
