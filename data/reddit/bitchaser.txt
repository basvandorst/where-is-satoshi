So lets say Gox collapses, what happens to their bitcoin inventory? They basically just stole it right? And then they would just sell them on another exchange?
@_date: 2014-03-30 09:14:09
I bought 100 BTC at $780.. Will hold to the moon.
@_date: 2014-02-21 17:48:04
Watch this stir up competition with more companies offering higher rates for GoxBTC. Eventually 1 GoxBTC will be worth .9 BTC, and with that.. a new, ridiculous, non-existent currency is created.

I'm sure other sites have shut down honorably as well. The only reason I am posting this is because bitbook was a very large service with many users working under absolute anonymity. Most services like that are not trustworthy but they showed great Customer Service and deserve a shoutout.

So theoretically I could make a topic titled "MtGox is racist" and link to mtgox.com/?racist and if it got enough clicks google would archive it as "mtgox is racist" with that URL?

Bitcoin is not considered currency in the US. The money transmitter laws only apply when people are converting USD/BTC, and only apply to certain jurisdictions with statutes regarding to the USD side of it.
@_date: 2014-03-14 01:45:57
Well that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing would it. A central authority could make sure all rewards were split correctly. It wouldn't need to generate an alt-coin, just proof of work. There would be no need for anonymity, transactions, confirmations, or many other things that go with the WHOLE bitcoin protocol, just the network power.

**Alabama Securities Commission:** Virtual or digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, have recently become popular as an alternative to cash or traditional lines of credit. Bitcoin and numerous other “crypto-currencies,” may be traded on online exchanges for conventional currencies, including the U.S. dollar, or used to purchase goods and services, usually online. Unlike traditional currencies, virtual currencies’ value can fluctuate radically according to user demand. In some cases, investors who trade on virtual currency exchanges have experienced trouble redeeming the digital currency or in cashing-out. The potential for fraudsters to use crypto-currencies to perpetrate financial scams is enticing due to the currencies not being issued by a governmental authority or financial institution, and having less regulatory oversight than transactions in conventional currencies. “The increasing prevalence of Bitcoin and other digital currencies has provided a fertile environment for financial criminals to make money on the increasing popularity and acceptance of these products,” said ASC Director, Joseph Borg. “The value of Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies can be highly volatile and investors should be aware that investments that incorporate ambiguous money systems can lead to very real risks, including the potential to lose one’s money!”

I believe its the damn prince again.
@_date: 2014-04-15 19:15:31
Yea I agree with this totally. They will focus on a single benefit of bitcoin and not incorporate all of the other important functions in the protocol. I think it is going to suck!! But also, I think more people will use it than bitcoin, just because it is piggy backing on TheFacebook.

Yep just like gold/usd.. You trade your time and things of value for USD, which is a placeholder for value in gold, which in turn doesn't exist.

Well  Sending bitcoin vs.  Cash in mail, Bitcoin definitely has more advantages.. With cash in the mail there are many different "nodes" the money could get displaced at. With Bitcoin, you can guarantee that address is receiving the money you sent. 
  and  provide a monitored and recorded security, which is not necessary with Bitcoin, though everything is still recorded and available to the public keeping you anonymous if you choose to be.
And your last statement.. Yes it is speculation! But when billions of dollars have been invested into speculation, I consider that a nice pillow between me and uncertainty, and if you are smart you can avoid huge risks and usually come out alright. Just like the stock market is "risky" you really dont have to take any risk at all to make a little money.
@_date: 2014-03-01 09:33:32
Honestly, who did Mt.Gox send BTC twice to? Nobody.. 424,242 BTC locked in 2 separate accounts with lost keys.
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:50:54
Ok sorry I was following the story closely but it was splitting into many different "assumptions" and I decided to take a few days off until things were proven. So this is confirmed that he lost the private keys, and they werent stolen but more so locked in cold storage forever?
@_date: 2014-03-10 05:02:09

Yea I am not sure if these are problems that would need some human element, or just the right amount of computing power. I don't think the network or protocol would have to be re-created for each individual problem though..

As a person who wins/loses 10 BTC per day via sports betting, I can say volatility has no impact on me. I used to be happy winning/losing 5 BTC per day, price dropped now I gotta increase my units.. not the end of the world. When BTC was on the upswing I was loving gambling. Bet $1000 to win $2000 and by the time the match is graded its worth $2300.. Loved it! BTC sports wagering till the death of me.

I feel like when they do have a physical exchange in NY and are charging 14% fees it will escalate the value of Bitcoin.
It will be a popular exchange, like Gox was, and it will establish many more investors through use of brokers who will help break down the fear barrier bitcoin has. Also, Gox had a premium that people paid for bitcoin that was higher than anywhere else. Other exchanges were always playing catch-up to Gox prices. I feel this will be the same situation we see in the NY exchange.

When you put your BTC in an online wallet, you are installing absolute trust on the administrator of the website to handle your assets accordingly. If they choose to fumble around and send "their" funds to accounts, losing the keys, and therefor unbalancing books so horribly it caused bankruptcy.  That could not happen with banked money of course in the USA, but that could not also happen with bitcoin in a cold wallet.
@_date: 2014-03-09 07:19:20

Reporter: You started the bitcoin chain, so you are Satoshi?
Nakamoto: No started big toy fake train set from internet. 
Reporter: This man is confirming he is Satoshi, creater of the bitcoin blockchain on the internet.
@_date: 2014-03-01 09:07:30
Are you saying just bank deposit as apposed to BTC? If so, THEY RECORD EVERYTHING, and can freeze you. Also only available inside USA, unless you are willing to pay substantial fees.

Thank you for reminding me.. That is always good to point out. I was explaining it as an immediate buy/transact method.. but even there it has risks. Always do research and do not purchase/invest unless you are absolutely sure you can handle the possible loss.
@_date: 2014-03-01 09:31:12
Ok, that is a valid point, except the transfer/wire takes effort/time/fees and the end user data of a bank transfer is obvious, while with bitcoin it is obscure right? So you would not see any advantage to using bitcoin, honestly?
