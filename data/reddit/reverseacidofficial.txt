Very true. Money allows you to ask for something in return for all the work that you put in. Either the work or the money or both end up giving you meaning. Money has so many implications that cannot be understood by people too busy to find that meaning.

Not really. Fort Knox is the outcome of the means used by the US government to confiscate Gold from the people. in 1933, FDR officially sent out an executive order forbidding the citizens to hoard any form of gold coin, bullion or certificate. 
Then started their half a century long combined effort to perpetually remove any gold linked to the Dollar.

Tell me about it, man. I've been trying to tell my friends and family that paper money is money because banks and the government say they are, but they won't believe me. They still think either gold or petrol or some commodity is backing them.

Seeing that instead of coming back with a well formed argument, you choose use to call me names, I just have to say that you’re right man. If you say so.

Well, I can’t say I didn’t agree with you, can I?

Yes, but a pizza is not deflationary, i.e, it’s size doesn’t increase as more people come to eat it.

I have no idea how you correlated both, but I’ll try to give a reasonable answer anyway. 
When I say scarcity depends on the perception, I mean that assuming the price trend keeps increasing, it gets harder and harder for a single individual to own a whole bitcoin. So then, instead of scaring people they can never own a whole bitcoin, we can lower the denomination we refer it in. When we denote in satoshis, we have an almost unlimited number of divisions by which people can interact with the crypto. Telling people there are 2.1 quadrillion satoshis in bitcoin changes the whole perception. People won’t feel left out anymore, they won’t fear scarcity anymore. 
I am calling for a distinction between Bitcoin (the Asset) and bitcoin (the denomination). It’s sort of like distinctions between Dollar (the currency) and dollar (the denomination, i.e, 100 cents)
Ultimately, we could live in a society where people who convey their net worth in bitcoin (the denomination) will be looked upon like millionaires and billionaires in today’s dollar based society. 
Again, I don’t understand your hostility towards the idea, but I understand that it’s all about perception anyway.

I understand that you still think of “bitcoin”, not the cryptocurrency but the denomination in its current form. But what I state in the article is that instead of trying to look at it in the current denomination, we can shift our perspective as the value increases. We can talk in about “Bitcoin” in terms of the Asset, and Satoshi in terms of denomination.
It’s sort of the reverse of going from cents to dollars. Since bitcoin is deflationary, we go downwards.
Hope that was helpful.
If not, I’d love to know more about your objection. Nothing wrong in trying to change our perspective when proved wrong. Good day buddy.

At least the bull run is going on somewhere
