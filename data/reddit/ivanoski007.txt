the ones still scamming people, also the criminals involved 
@_date: 2018-08-23 03:59:50
more techno mumbo jumbo to keep perpetuating the ponzi scheme?
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:43:33
you will end up like this guy, they all do eventually, enjoy your delusional fake money until you step back to reality 
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:36:06
got to perpetuate the ponzi scheme somehow 
@_date: 2018-08-23 04:01:22
just like bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-08-23 03:57:22
yeah, that way we can all point and laugh when you lose all your money
@_date: 2018-10-15 15:36:43
Never sell, see it all crash and burn, never see money, never pay taxes, sounds legit
@_date: 2018-10-15 18:33:15
I can thing of more fun ways to lose my money 
@_date: 2018-10-15 15:38:22
don´t worry , when you  lose it all it will be easier
@_date: 2018-10-15 15:37:58
by then crypto would have crashed and burned, get out while you still can
@_date: 2018-10-09 22:14:42
it will be more expensive for you than credit cards in the long run, might as well remove it 
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:56:45
this whole thread is comedy gold 
@_date: 2018-06-11 23:45:50
can't wait to see them become worthless 
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:03:25
I don't believe in crypto, and I laugh at those who do 
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:08:54
you must be new here 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:49:35
op is a fake scammer 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:04:44
op is a fake scammer 
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:13:49
this is why we must be @_date: 2017-11-06 19:03:14
also op is fake as shit 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:09:14
cash 80% of it out now! leave the rest for speculation. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:14:43
I hope so 
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:39:31
Bitcoin,, has no intrinsic value at all. Combine that lack of a tether to reality with the very limited extent to which bitcoin is used for anything, and you have an asset whose price is almost purely speculative, and hence incredibly volatile.
It is also easily. manipulated to drive prices up or down. and only used to either buy illegal thing or hold on to it with the hopes that it will give amazing returns
just like a ponzi scheme, early adopters made a lot of money and drew a lot of "investors" but todays investors will only fill the money bags of early adoptors until it continues to crash. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:19:19
you don't care of all the exit scams and other scams that have happened in the crypto world? 
@_date: 2018-11-12 00:43:47
such delusion, you can't do bitcoin without middle men 
@_date: 2018-11-21 12:16:05
doubtful, it's not going to succeed at this rate. it has to be easier to use than credit card (or Paypal) and have the SAME liquidity as cash to gain mass acceptance. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:12:26
global competitor to the dollar?
such fucking delusion 
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:55:19
jajaja better than kissing scammers ass, lol
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:06:09


fixed it 
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:07:50
salvage with no airbags 
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:02:46
But what happens when he has to cash out?
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:12:50
buy more drugs?
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:16:15
let's say if cryptocurrency was in place instead of dollars during that time (hypothetically speaking), would the result have been any different? 
@_date: 2018-11-17 20:53:52
oh wow, finally the world is changing when I can get my hair cut in Croatia and pay with bitcoin! take that banks! 
@_date: 2018-11-18 03:34:39
just look at all the alt coins and all the exit scams, why is bitcoin any different 
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:16:06
You think it would have happened any different with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:58:27
he has bitcoin so no
@_date: 2018-11-12 05:21:00
probably made by some teen edge Lord 
@_date: 2018-11-17 18:22:45
go to the supermarket and pay with your imaginary digital money then, or what use is it if you are just holding on to it because guess what? it is fucking useless unless you convert it to cold hard cash. that's the ponzi scheme, you are just bag holders waiting for your ship to come and shill it at every chance you get so it goes up in value as some poor idiot wastes his money on bitcoin. All in the end the point is that it is supposed to ... convert it to cash. so yeah, keep sitting on your imaginary stash of numbers because when you will need it for the real world to actually buy something you will have a nice rude awakening. I believe you are the one confused to how the real world works.


hahahahahah, that's literally how bitcoin works. Got to find fools to waste money on bitcoin so others can cash out. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 00:40:21
wake up sheeple ��, hahaha ha, such delusion in this thread, I wonder what tune op will sing when bitcoin crashes 
@_date: 2018-11-13 18:54:53


I agree completely
@_date: 2018-11-13 15:03:01
The ammount of stupid you demonstrated with your statement is astounding. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:04:46
a fool and their money... 
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:34:56
hahaha 
@_date: 2018-11-28 00:32:42
time to double down on your losses I see, let's bet it all on red! 
@_date: 2018-11-26 05:26:47
ummm I can still do payments with cash, I think you are confused or believe in some utopia where bitcoin is easier and more liquid than cash.
in fact if the lights go out and technology with it, cash will still be king. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:19:27
they are not prohibited, is that they can't 
@_date: 2018-11-26 05:25:26
indeed 
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:44:46
only themselves because they are holding 
@_date: 2018-11-13 15:36:12


Is it just american cards or do all cards not work in flight?
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:57:10
That´s dumb, so basically "the only way for bitcoin to become a standard world currency is by NOT spending it" genius assertion there pal
@_date: 2018-11-12 00:45:58
it needs to be regulated because it is the best way for scammers and criminals to get their money 
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:10:47
Why is everyone fascinated with dicks in this thread
@_date: 2018-11-12 00:45:17
I don't think that long wait times for a transaction seem efficient 
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:59:11
"hurrr durr you should have seen bitcoin LAST year it was AMAZING! "
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:00:42
You should have bought apple stocks then back in the 90´s! WHY DIDN´T you!
@_date: 2018-11-26 12:04:50
if governments used bitcoin you think they wouldn't steal? 
@_date: 2018-11-16 14:16:31
lol you are such a crypto stereotype it is not even funny, have fun playing with imaginary money and perpetuating the ponzi scheme. Don´t come crying when another exit scam hits ya. How many shitty alt coins are in your portafolio?
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:04:07
$bitcoin has value to me, I don't care about the actual market value "
@_date: 2018-11-17 20:52:15
none, just people scamming each other or buying illegal things 
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:17:39
I think the inverse is true, shills promoting bitcoin for the next scam 
@_date: 2018-11-12 05:20:01
acceptance of bitcoin is never going to happen as long as it is still inferior to cash and credit cards. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:01:29
and how would have bitcoin made that transaction easier? 
@_date: 2018-11-28 14:23:01


what does that mean?


so um..... huh?


I'm still confused �� 
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:57:45
You´d be better off buying gold then
@_date: 2018-11-24 02:10:47
what if he needs to pay other things 
@_date: 2018-11-13 15:14:01
OK, lets start with your statement.  Why does ryan air need to accept bitcoin for in cabin purchases?
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:08:16
I thought bitcoin was super easy and efficient 
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:35:48
how does it feel to be on the receiving end of the ponzi scheme? 
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:18:47
bitcoin is useless as a currency, it only serves as a gambling tool 
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:10:46
You are just perpetuating the sterotype that bitcoin is only good for illegal things, gambling and holding on to it. IF anything , that is hurting the image of bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-27 00:52:05
doubtful, nice fantasy 
@_date: 2018-11-20 04:25:08
how can they afford it if they are holding? also, Lamborghini doesn't accept bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-11-12 05:20:21
to scam people yet 
@_date: 2018-11-26 12:15:40
right, take your idiotic hippie mentality elsewhere, no wonder you bought bitcoin,. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:59:40
yes, and a modern variation of that is called bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-11-13 18:38:01
1st of all, amex sucks ass outside of the USA, it is useless, better to just use Visa or MC.
2, what makes you think that there will not be huge fees with bitcoin? Or in the very least an inflated price due to its volatility? Not to mention the way more complicated nature of transactions vrs credit cards?
Op´s problem is having an AMEX in the first place, just use a VISA boom , problem solved. Yet another example of where bitcoin is NOT needed
@_date: 2018-11-24 03:43:50
or lose it all when it crashes, such is the trust of an unstable currency 
@_date: 2018-11-26 05:25:51
no, they just steal thier money 
@_date: 2018-11-12 01:59:55
I can make purchases instantly with credit card 
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:19:56
everyone in this sub is waiting their turn to buy a Ferrari 
@_date: 2018-11-12 00:44:17
so sad to you trying to scam so many fools into using bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 05:19:19
you mean like it is so easy to cash out on bitcoin? or when yet another exit scam from a shit coin happens how easy it is to get your money? or how you need middle men anyways to trade bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:37:26
the amount of shills and scammers is astounding 
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:49:03
yes, but the dollar isn't going away anytime soon and bitcoin will not replace it immediately as the Supreme winner anyway. you might be thinking maybe 50-100 years forward of pure speculation 
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:05:00
so far it's pure speculation, I'll believe it when I see it. Seems like a lot of hoops against regular cash or credit card transactions 
@_date: 2018-11-28 00:31:33
where does it say that? 
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:13:11
people are literally dumping money into it (because it is all over the news) , when the buys slow down, and the limited things you can do with bitcoin become more and more apparent, we'll see how sustainable the growth is in the long term. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 20:48:49
hold until value goes to zero, then, continue holding! 
@_date: 2018-11-27 03:24:46
why bother waste each other's time 
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:27:53
riiiiiiight, you keep telling yourself that 
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:07:16
there was a glitch in the credit card pos and suddenly bitcoin Will solve all the world's problems, no one is going to adopt an unstable fake money, with slow transactions and inconvenient transaction, you are just salty with bitcoin dip
@_date: 2018-11-17 20:55:18
the formula is correct, bitcoin prices are zero 
@_date: 2018-11-12 05:21:29
that's so cringe worthy 
@_date: 2018-11-27 23:33:19
and the billions they would lose when they don't cash out in time 
@_date: 2018-11-23 14:22:49
Got to keep shilling the ponzi scheme what greater time!
@_date: 2018-11-17 20:50:47
nobody is going to adopt this scam 
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:06:31
they've locked all the threads and deleted any recent ones 
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:23:56
idealistic and pure fantasy, this post is garbage 
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:07:25
is there a place where we can point and laugh at bitconnect? 
@_date: 2018-11-22 02:27:47
yeah but bitcoin is only known for those 3 things, while obviously Fiat is mor versatile 
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:23:16
he wants it to rise so he can sell 
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:15:24
that you're a dumbass? 
@_date: 2018-04-09 23:46:33
Bitcoin is crashing hard, maybe the bubble finally burst
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:22:31
this looks like when a 15yo makes a chart �� 
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:23:56
Never sell! only hold!   
sound advice, might as well start a fire with my money since i will never see it again anyway
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:22:41
a reflection of reality i see
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:22:38
have fun losing money, should have spent it in a casino for extra fun!
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:46:48
ITT: some delusional people who think the comic is true
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:43:48
or continue going down 
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:37:14
ITT salty tears... mmmmmmmmmmmm
@_date: 2018-12-06 01:02:41
how much have they lost in value? 
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:46:05
venezuela, the best example for everything
@_date: 2018-12-04 12:38:20
A: not easy
B: unlike crypto who can crash at any moment right?
c: Western union is instant.
wow you are desperately reaching out 
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:27:56
that is what they all say..... and then it hits a new bottom
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:45:38
especialy 3 hahahaha all the notoriuos hacks
@_date: 2018-12-04 15:16:13
\&gt;   You keep it, I don't want it.
I will , at least i can buy groceries and pay the bills with them, unlike you with your imaginary play money.
\&gt;  whine on other peoples investment on the internet?
I´m just observing how people love to gamble
A: Oh yeah that is why everyone's grandmother is using counterfits. wait... i hear another ICO coin needing cash for thier ponzi scheme
B:  Difference is with the paper money you're 100% sure it will crash over time unlike Bitcoin which you're 100% sure it will crash over time. I don´t get you rlogic there
C: WU isn't decentralised, isn't censorship resistant, isn't good for micropayments etc.
Are you sure about that? i think it is you who needs to research more the benefits of cash. If cash is so bothersome for you, i can take some off your hands if you don´t want it
@_date: 2018-12-06 01:02:12
let's see if it hits a new low by Xmas! 
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:24:40
is bitcoin the dying currency?
@_date: 2018-12-04 04:51:43
Because they give you cash instead of imaginary coins you can´t easily cash out
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:22:22
people stop beeing greedy!!!!
yeah right
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:51:47
We must follow Venezuelas example! lol
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:45:10
Are you sure the comic isn't talking about bitcoin?
