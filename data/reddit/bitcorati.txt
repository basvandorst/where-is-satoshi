This was part of our objective in building Bitcorati.com - A professional community of thought leaders and experts in the bitcoin space! Detailed member and business profiles are coming soon. We're also build a ratings system (similar to S&amp;P, Moody's, etc.) for bitcoin businesses!

Ha! I knew this was a great idea... Bitcorati.com had plans to do this 6 months ago and have just been slow to implement. Expect to see 100's if not 1000's of online businesses create their own crypto currency over the next few years.

I agree but I'd be curious if Coinbase and BitPay have some type of 3rd party market maker who buys these coins or do they just get sold as a market order on an open exchange.

I use to work at eBay/PayPal and I know they've been working on things related to Bitcoin for quite some time... I actually introduced Bitcoin to many of my co-workers there back in late 2012. PayPal is definitely going to enable Bitcoin in its online wallet, the only questions is when... I think it will be introduced later this year.

Just for future reference, it's "Bitcoin" not "BitCoin".
@_date: 2014-04-02 02:19:17


The difference is that Dogecoin WAS created as a joke- even its creator did not anticipate that it would be anywhere near as successful as it has become. Bitcoin was not created as joke by Satoshi and was supported by a quite serious bunch of core developers and enthusiasts (and today by serious businesses and investors). Even if the public thought Bitcoin was a joke initially, Satoshi's intentions were not. Maybe Dogecoin will find a niche, but with a $35 million market cap (0.58 percent of the Bitcoin market cap) and limited practical use cases, I can't see it being anything much more than that.

Your response is so typical. Ripple is a "centralized preowned" scam? Either you get paid to say that or you really are that stupid.
@_date: 2014-05-23 15:44:32
Wow, I'm really beginning to lose faith in the intelligence level of my fellow bitcoiners based on your response. Are you all so drunk on Bitcoin, so attached and entrenched into one way of thinking you can't see what Ripple is? It sounds like you got all your information about Ripple from hearsay rather than doing your own research. There was a time when gold bugs were saying the same kinds of things about bitcoin, but not anymore. Thy eventually came to their senses.
@_date: 2014-01-14 05:16:09
Awesome... just added to the Bitcorati directory! 
@_date: 2014-05-24 04:04:22
Fine, I'll point somethings out to you, but I'm sure (like I said) you've probably already made up your mind about Ripple and nothing I say will convince you otherwise. I've pointed out these things to many people in private emails and personal convos and after accepting the facts, most of them become believers in Ripple. (keep in mind my crypto portfolio is 80% BTC and 20% XRP atm so I'm not bashing Bitcoin at all). I see a future where both can exist like Pepsi and Coke or Apple and Microsoft - both survive and do quite well!
1. The distribution of ripple is only a short-term issue, I agree with you that humans shouldn't be trusted with determining how newly created currency gets distributed, but once they are distributed all XRP will trade on an open market so that problem works itself out over time. At least Ripple can distribute XRP in a way that directly encourages the expansion and usage of the protocol by giving to developers and gateways and people who innovate on top of the platform.
2. Bitcoin mining has already become centralized and in the hands of a few technical elite and wealthy people, and if you're not one of them mining is not profitable. It's also a waste of computing power and energy.
3. Ripple is the fastest P2P payment system with 3 to 5 second confirmation times. Bitcoin takes 30 to 60 minutes! For point-of-sale, this is HUGE, and offers a better solution than Bitcoin from a payment network perspective. Sure, you can accept a bitcoin payment after only 1 confirmation or immediately (with off-block transactions) using BitPay or Coinbase, but there's still some risk there that the processors are handling. Ripples lightning fast transaction time could completely replace ACH and SEPA!
4. Ripple is also currency agnostic (actually value agnostic) and allows anyone to trade any currency, asset, or thing of value with anyone else including dollars, bitcoins, yen, Litecoin, airline miles, loyalty points, or even rights to physical precious metals. The Bitcoin protocol only allows for transfers of bitcoin and you have to go through exchanges to trade.
5. Ripple (unlike Bitcoin) would allow for a system where a consumer can pay with dollars and merchant receives bitcoin, or the consumer pays with XRP and the merchant receives dollars or any number of currency pairs you can imagine... and it all happens automatically, fast, without the sender or receiver having to think about the currency conversion. The fees for currency conversions would trend down over time as more people use the network. Ripple could (in theory) not just reduce the cost of remittances, but completely replace the existing system.
I'm just scratching the surface with a few things, but I recommend you also check out  to learn more... Fred has evaluated all the altcoins and he's a big fan of Ripple!
Ripple also doesn't spit in the face of the government and banks and positions itself as friendly to the existing financial system, a way to improve rather than kill it. This could prove to be its biggest strength being widely accepted and adopted more than Bitcoin in the future. If the banks start backing it, Ripple will become the crypto payment network of choice.

The people who think this spells the end of Ripple and XRP are going to be the same people who thought Bitcoin was dead after the crash of 2011 or 2013. I love Bitcoin and that's primarily what I own. I think Bitcoin has a bright future, but the naysayers are only dismissing Ripple at their own peril. Put your bias and ego aside and understand Ripple. Hindsight will be 20/20 in a few years and those who got too emotionally attached to Bitcoin (perhaps because they're so heavily invested in it) will miss a great opportunity. Do yourself a favor and really take the time to understand Ripple the way you have Bitcoin and you will see an amazing protocol for value exchange that actually does fix some very critical issues with Bitcoin. The worst may not be over in terms of the value of XRP, but we're talking about a very short term event (Jed dumping) that will have a short-term impact. The utility value of the Ripple protocol will ultimately determine the long term value of XRP. After taking some time to understand what this Jed news means today I've come to accept it as positive for the future of Ripple and the Ripple protocol! Looking forward to buying more ripples during Jed's fire-sale in two weeks. Thanks Jed!

The comparison is ridiculous and it tells you two things about people who make the comparison... either A. They haven't done their research and have NO CLUE what bitcoin actually is (ie. they only look at bitcoin news headlines) or B. They stand to lose if bitcoin succeeds, and therefore feel threatened by bitcoin. or perhaps even C. They are envious/jealous of early adopters who saw potential of bitcoin and who are now doing quite well... so they bash bitcoin with tulip comparisons in hopes of bursting the bubble and then being able to boast about how they called it. Peter Schiff is one of these people who made the comparison - he loves to brag about his warnings of the real estate bubble and collapse 2007-2010. He's just hoping to put another bubble call on his resume, but he really doesn't seem to have a genuine understanding of bitcoin.

Very well said Amanojack... I try to get a similar point across to people that ask me about bitcoins as well. I don't think the value of Bitcoin can be determined by conventional methods since its not one single thing. The value of Bitcoin must be considered based on 4 primary qualities, that as a storage of value, payment network, distributed accounting system (blockchain), and currency- something the world has never seen until Bitcoin. Trying to value Bitcoin based on one quality is why people don't understand it's current price or why so many think will be worth 100x or 1000x more in the future.

It took just over 4 years for the bitcoin economy to grow to a $1B market and less than 2 weeks to go from $1B to $2B... if we looked at this like Facebook (which btw, I think is way different and nowhere near the opportunity as bitcoin), from a valuation perspective we're in for a wild ride ahead! Remember, Yahoo tried to buy Facebook in Sep. 2006 for $1B, Microsoft made an investment in Facebook a year later that valued the company at $15B and by 2012, Facebook IPO'd at a $100B valuation. Bitcoin, I think will grow much faster. We could see $100B market cap by end of 2013 or early 2014. I see the potential for a $1 Trillion bitcoin market by 2020! With about 17.8 mm coins in circulation then, we're looking at a $56,000 price per coin!

Hmmm... this is interesting.

For eBay is makes perfect sense to accept them, but with PayPal it's more tricky.

Everyone needs to stop treating bitcoin like a stock and how you can "trade" it or "invest" in it... with bitcoin you're buying into a revolution, a new and disruptive paradigm shift in currency. The value of a bitcoin can't go straight up overnight so we'll likely see many "bubbles" and corrections, but it's hard to imagine it ever going down to zero now at this point. Just look at the buy/ask volume on Mt. Gox and you'll consistently see way more buyers supporting less sellers. Fiat currencies are more vulnerable than bitcoin. If fact, central bank notes are designed to go down to almost zero over time because they are debased! Also, remember that unlike stock, bitcoin hoarders don't have to cash out in order to reap the rewards of their increased purchasing power if/when the coins value shoot up to $1,000 or more. Some early adopters who had several thousand bitcoins recognized there are benefits to just spending the coins or diversifying into other crypto currencies rather than converting to fiat cash. They can just start spending their bitcoins on things they need. I myself have established a savings of bitcoins that I plan keep for a long time. Then for everyday items I will transfer cash into bitcoin/litecoin on a regular basis and purchase things I need to support and help grow the bitcoin economy. You can't use stock or gold to pay for goods and services. So no need for bitcoin to crash due to a sell-off. Volatility and % price increases on bitcoin should also shrink over time as more merchants offline and online accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:44:01

Since when does being antisocial = a better person? I was't chatting with people about personal crusades... they asked me about bitcoin and I responded. You reddit trolls never cease to amaze me with your comments. Get a life!

Another side to this argument is considering what I call the "conversion necessity" or the necessity to convert Bitcoins into cash/fiat or "cash out" - unlike stocks, real estate, bonds, and commodities, Bitcoins are a currency in addition to being a storage of value. Therefore, over time and with increased merchant and business acceptance the conversion necessity goes down as Bitcoins can be used directly to buy stuff. For now there is a higher necessity to convert since you can't easily buy everything you need directly with Bitcoins. Expect to see the conversion necessity decline rapidly over the next 5 years when more and more bitcoin owners will simply spend their coins to buy things rather than converting to cash/fiat first and then buy. It makes more sense for early adopters to look for ways to spend their coins to buy what they want (boat, car, house - see bitpremier.com) than to cash out into fiat first.

cryptmarketcap.com is useless and is doing a diservice to its visitors by not including Ripple and Mastercoin. Some people just need to pull their head out of the sand. Coinmarketcap.com still serves as the better, more accurate and agnostic repersentation of crypto currency marketcaps. Ripple and Mastercoin do offer something unique and valuable to crypto space and anyone thinking they are a scam or a joke will have a rude awakening in 2014!

Eventually we'll be ranking several things directly and indirectly related to crypto currencies (cryptolytics), but to start we'll just be ranking people and businesses- those who have been the most influential in the world of bitcoins (bitcosphere), and continue to play a critical role in pushing this math-bsed currency forward. Rank will be based on a scoring methodology that includes user/peer reviews, user voting, and data points obtain from the blockchain, API's, search and social mentions

This is great news! PayPal might be next... (disclosure: I work for a division of eBay (not PayPal), but I'm aware that bitcoin has been discussed within the company since 2011 and I've personally reignited those discussions in the past couple months. I know some people here don't like PayPal (for various reasons), but I think they could provide a lot in terms of security and payment processing for bitcoins, and if fees were kept low it still preserves bitcoin's low to zero fee features with added security and faster adoption worldwide.

I think EDM DJs will be the first to do this... Knife Party already offers a new EP recently available for Bitcoins but my business parter and I have been contemplating this idea and with his connections in the music biz as a dj/producer himself we are trying to get a guy like Tiesto or Deadnau5 to offer a new track or album exclusively for Bitcoins!

Seriously, a wall of shame or something would be awesome! We'll be looking back at videos like this in 2 years wondering how people like Greenwald could so grossly underestimated Bitcoin. Eh, their loss I guess.
@_date: 2013-10-31 04:02:21
It's an estimate. Coinbase.com has over 300,000 users and blockchain.info has over 500,000 wallets. You can assume some duplication, but not all bitcoin users (globally) have an account with either site. Therefore, 500,000 is a pretty good baseline estimate. It could actually be much higher!

It might take a decade to fight and win this battle but it will happen. Politically based, government controlled, fiat currency is dying- make way for the math-based revolution! Not sure why Paypal and Bitcoin were lumped together in this article, they're so different.

For now. Bitcoin is still a baby... give it some time! :-)
@_date: 2013-06-15 04:38:25
No that's not a bad idea.... We could launch an awareness campaign of sorts where everyone hits the web and social media with facts and figures comparing politically based FED dollars to math-based Bitcoin currency. I'm thinking an infographic or short explainer video would be good! We could likely get some of the most widely used Bitcoin merchants to offer specials that day as well. Hmmm.... maybe I'll bake this into my marketing budget for bitcorati.com

It's as if a small division or subsidiary of Google or Amazon decided to accept bitcoins. I'd love to use bitcoins to pay for AWS or Google Apps as I'm sure many others would. Jaisule accepting bitcoins is very similar IMO.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:54:47
This is great news. I think it shows that the Feds are not anti innovation or anti technology as some might think and thus do recognize the benefits to society in allowing certain concepts (like Bitcoin) grow... like we saw with the Internet. As long as they can regulate it and bust criminals they can care less how many legitimate new rich people are minted from the Bitcoin Rush! They also realize that even if Bitcoin zoomed up to be a 2.1 Trillion dollar market there would still be a demand for dollars. It's likely taxes and oil will be paid for in dollars for a very long time!

We'll certainly be open about how things are ranked and don't expect it to be that complicated to start. Probably will be heavily weighted on user/visitor votes and various data points we can pull in to score. Google's PageRank and Facebook EdgeRank are valuable algorithms that are protected at some level in order to provide exclusive value to their respective businesses and user base (even though everyone generally knows how they work).

Wow, I hadn't looked at this post all day. Seems like most of you like this idea. Nice! I'm an individual member of the Bitcoin Foundation and silver industry member so I might ping some folks there and others I met at the Bitcoin Conference to see if we can organize something. Even if it's not a physical event, maybe a virtual awareness type campaign might be worthy.

Do you have relevant experience? Are you an economist? No I'm not, but I do have a business degree and have previous experience writing economic reports when I was an analyst in commercial real estate. However, the article is simply an opinion piece (everyone is entitled to their own) and the intention of it was to spark a conversation about what bitcoin is worth if it's going to be a viable global currency. Judging by the attention it's received I think I've succeeded and for every critic I have 10 people agreeing with me. See you at $10k... Thanks!

Bought a lot more btc yesterday on Coinbase and more this morning on BTC-e! Also spending some bitcoins to attend this conference in may &gt;  When these hacks happen to Mt. Gox I just think of the analogy of when someone attempts to rob a bank. That doesn't mean the whole currency is in trouble...just an incident at that bank and life goes on!

What Joe fails to understand is that the higher the price goes the less volatile bitcoin will be. A higher price also gives it a much larger market cap and with more value in the bitcoin economy means more people will be willing to spend and more business willing to accept. I actually feel sorry for Joe, he's going to be paid in bitcoins one day (wherever he ends up working) and painfully regret ever doubting bitcoin!

Really looking forward to seeing this exchange succeed. I had the pleasure of meeting Megan Burton, the CoinX CEO, this summer in New York and I can tell you this the real deal.

Yep, I purchased 20 of these 700 rare coins two weeks before Mike suspended sales and now this news! The value of these coins will almost certainly rise, measured in multiples of bitcoins over face value... I had a feeling this would happen and played a big role in my decision to purchase them. I hope Mike is able to continue making these at some point, but if not, the ones he has made and distributed will be worth multiples of their face value (priced in BTC) for unredeemed coins!

Exactly, and we should expect to see a bump in value after the block reward halves to 12.5 at the end of 2016 and even more when it drops to 6.25 at the end of 2020. Can't even imagine what the difficulty will be then. I didn't really mention mining in the article and the effect that it has on the base value of bitcoin, but I do recognize it plays a major role.
