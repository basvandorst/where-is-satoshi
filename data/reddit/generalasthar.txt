~~Dude you can't have it both ways. Either bitcoins are made "out of thin air" and so are dollars, or neither are.~~
~~Both have forces and assets backing them up. One has an advantage of a more powerful force, being the government, and the other has a more powerful factor of not being able to inflate~~`

My thoughts exactly. Someone coming from twitter just signals to me CANCER CANCER CANCER
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:04:20
I bought in a little higher a couple days ago, but same deal. hopefully we will come out of the January slump soon
edit: damn, you bought more than me! XD
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:53:20
Exactly what I am up to as well. As a techie, ethereum excites me more, but I expect BTC to have better returns... we will see if my  short term guess ends up right
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:46:22
Well, I certainly missed out on yesterday's sale, but I think we are still in quite a dip :)
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:39:17
I wish this topic was being upvoted, because its not just BTC/ETH, my regular stocks are down pretty heavy today. 
I'm curious if there are any resources which compare regular stock price movements with btc price movements
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:53:44
Because twitter is a hypocritical entity only to be rivaled by youtube now a days. Platform that got rich off the back of freedom of speech that now polices thought, protects western feminists because they are powerful in the west while banning middle eastern feminists because they have rich saudis backing their platform, policing their users behavior OFF SITE, using their verification system as some sort of retarded reward for right think or having connections, and not *verifying someone is who they say they are*
That's just the shit I can think of off the top of my head. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:14:43
Silly question, but what does running your own node do for you, aside from just helping out the network? Or is that is? I'm just curious 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:33:56
Sorry for your loss, but I will probs be buying soon to get in on this crash. XD
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:24:20
You are totally right, I conflated you with some previous posters in this subthread. My mistake!
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:35:04
Needs more jpeg
@_date: 2019-07-08 17:51:04
Not much for me. I tried to do some mining but the value sucks right now and isnt worth ut for snall fries.
This concerns me a little bit
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:50:44
Generally speaking not a good idea.
@_date: 2019-07-03 01:01:04
Congrats! Not chump change
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:14:34
Found the troll
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:16:47
I would like to see such a correction. It would convince me to buy in lol
(yes yes yes, i know this will get me flooded with THE BEST TIME TO BUY IS NOW! posts)
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:34:32
How does this lightning network work? Is it it's own blockchain that then copies its purchases to the BTC blockchain or something?
@_date: 2018-09-22 06:24:15
You can get pissy at me all you like, but i bought at 11k. This is way down
@_date: 2018-09-07 19:20:58
KYC form?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:03:21
Sounds like they need to resolve the use of its purchase for goods, else bitcoin could face serious backlash. 
Bitcoin isn't that handy (as a transaction medium) if I have to pay capital gains every time I buy a haircut with it.
@_date: 2018-09-21 19:45:15
Nice to see, but honestly... we are still way down so hopefully we can see that change
@_date: 2018-05-12 17:20:26
The word you are looking for is "then". "Then have understanding."
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:02:18
I don't think relating anything bitcoin related to bolivars is a smart idea until those numbers look absurd.
Don't undervalue how incredibly stupid people are with numbers and how it can fuck something over. 
Remember, the 1/3 lb burger failed to beat he 1/4 lb burger because people THOUGHT it was smaller.
When people hear "Venezualan bolivar" they think "super hyper inflated" and when they see something less than 10's of thousands per bolivar they would see them as on the same level.  IE they would see bitcoin as worthwhile as the bolivar

I agree bitcoin has value, but lets not pretend gold doesn't  :p
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:41:03
I didnt have more money to buy with :(.
But at least i wasnt stupid enough to sell
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:16:05
My only stress is that I have finite money, and I can never tell where the bottom is :P. I really want to buy more now, but I spent my money when it was "low" at 11k, and "low" again at 9k.
It's money I could afford to lose though, so its HODLing strong, but it sucks to see it this low 
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:46:10
Haha my mistake! We'll get there someday
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:00:08
Im not sure i understand, and i thought i understood margin trading.
A long position means you are betting the price is going up,  right?
@_date: 2019-06-30 04:13:26
Amazing. Literally everything you said there was wrong
Memes aside, seriously i am not sure what you are watching, but no, google trying to interfere with the 2020 election is not a conspiracy theory lol. We have insiders, documents and recordings. Several.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:53:09
Ive bought what I can. Can i have a whole bitcoin plz? Haha only half joking... one day i will be in the 22,000,000 club
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:51:04
So what is driving this spike? 
I mean i am happy, i hodled through my 11k buy in "loss", but i like to understand what is happening. 
I feel like its buy time, soon followed by time to sell when it hits 100k, then buy again when it dips back down to 11k (from around 100k), and go to sleep for another 2 years
@_date: 2019-06-30 04:17:31
They've never doctored a video lol. Last time MSNBC said that they dropped the full videos for the whole world to see and it was obvious who the liars were.  
However,  no one watched 2 hours of unedited undercover video because its 75% shakey walking footage,  that has nothing to do with the investigation
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:37:15
Just get a tech guy to attach the hard drive to a computer and copy the data. Its not really hard.
That will be one bitcoin please haha
Edit : also, hey its me, your brother!
@_date: 2019-06-30 12:54:26
Both were just articles making assertions. The second of which flat out ignored the easily viewable facts ln what they call "fairness" isnt fairness. Unless you REALLY think the top two results for "men can" is *really* have babies and menstruate. (It still is that btw, they never bothered to hide it)
I will look into being sued by acorn, but that is a heck of a weak accusation. Its like being sued by the kkk. What does losing really mean?
There is a lot more i want to say, but typing on a phone sucks and i have somewhere to be.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:21:44
Oh so you mean a whale massively sells to drive prices down, causing you to have to close,  driving the price even further down, then rebuying at a cheaper price and making a profit?
Man, whale power
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:09:02
Thank you internet stranger - this sort of response always beats a "go read this faq" type responses.
Here's to your bitcoin rising and to me joining in when I know it better

I believe someone familiar with ubuntu should be able to fix that,  esp if it is windows 7 or earlier.
They load up ubuntu, modify the password file on the hard drive, then you can get into windows.
Another approach would be a password cracker, but you can help that along by giving it words and numbers you tend to use
Edit :right,  you arent op
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:24:14
Lurker - what is the difference between the subs? If there is a difference it seems they are going to lengths to make it look like another bitcoin sub
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:04:58
So what is this?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:19:19
lol no worries. I only bought what I could afford to totally lose, and I didn't encounter tether so ... only thing being lost is the coin value. (unless tether has anything to do with gemini?)
Hell, if it goes low enough I will buy more coins and just sit on it the years it takes to rebound. I really meant to buy in a long time ago... I always miss my intuition timings. I wanted to buy Nintendo stock back when it was like $20 because I knew the Switch wasn't going to flop like the Wiiu. I did get around to buying it, but much later so I didn't double my money from that XD
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:32:52
Way down. I've been a sideline cheerleader for btc and eth for awhile, so I was looking for a "dip" to buy in at. 
Might still buy some more, but I'm waiting for it to stabilize XD. I both wish to support decentralization on the internet, as well as believe it will be lucrative in the long run. 
I know this is the bitcoin sub, but I actually believe ethereum will be even more valuable in the future as it is really more of a platform than just a currency
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:50:46
24,345.75Price decrease1,175.21 (4.60%)
That's from google, and we are talking the Dow Jones. dropping that fast is *really really bad*. Remember these markets tend to be stable, that definitely has a rippling effect
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:32:49
If you actually had to buy a whole bitcoin, I would agre. But you don't :P
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:48:54
Not the purpose of the loan. Frankly, its concerning

Money is there to spend. Eventually it gets spent. Even if Scrooge stores it up his whole life and dies, it typically gets passed on and spent. In the case of bitcoin it does have the chance of being lost, but that would just drive up the value of other coins and THOSE people would spend. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:30:35
tired of buying on the way down. Making sure it's recovering before grabbing more.
Would rather miss the bottom on the way up than on the way down
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:47:52
Waaaah, someone else is doing something wrong! that somehow justifies me doing wrong! Leave me alone! waaaah
Such millennial morality. Cleanup your own room before condemning others 
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:34:55
I was wondering.... will be interesting to see how low it goes this time. Maybei will grab some if when it hits 6k again.
Time to see how resiliant bitcoin is

Appreciate the warning. You can only diminish confirmation bias soo much through vigilance.
I do have the wonderful "gift" of being terribly self aware though, so my brain likes to go out of it's way to let me know when I was wrong haha...

That is the part of investing that is risky fucking business
@_date: 2018-04-12 19:06:58
Not sure I understand
@_date: 2018-04-12 19:41:43
I understand most of that, however wouldn't someone betting bitcoin going down just quickly sell what they have? 
Or does short mean some sort of buyer who is betting BTC will go down, but not right now so they are waiting on something?
I just guess I am missing how they are being FORCED to buy back in at a higher price
Thanks for the answer thus far though :)
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:51:53
I had no money to buy more low, so I'm glad it's on its way back up
@_date: 2018-04-18 19:48:00
Honestly, the whole bcash thing confused me when I got into this. Was really frustrating
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:14:20
