If this is right with extremely high probability the last two words are “almost open”. Any link to the stackexchange question?

If OP tells you how to solve it it's not a puzzle anymore, it's a donation
@_date: 2018-05-21 11:24:52
That's the same I saw yesterday, another guy hypothesis was that the creator of the puzzle is the guy that gave the last answer as it was given two days ago, a couple of hours before the puzzle was public

* 1\) You can throw out at least half of the words in the picture
* 2\) Think in pairs
* 3\) Code easily, attack early
* 4\) Lost transaction costs almost users
* 5\) 00212121
* 6\) Try \+1
* 7\) Almost open
I've been able to find "almost" "open" "lost" "transaction" "costs" "users" "code" "easily" "attack" "early"
Here's an image: [
1\) I think first clue clearly tell us that what we are looking for is a series of bip39 words, this statement gets stronger if we consider the fact the one user arised the hypothesis that the last answer on this post on stack exchange [ is by the same guy who posted the riddle, and in the answer he quotes bip39.
2\)Honestly I have no clue on what this means, maybe we should look at similar words "transaction" and "transactions", or maybe the position as "attack" and "data" both inside a "c"
3\), 4\), 6\) &amp; 7\) Are all words I marked in the image
5\) 00212121 was given as an answer where an user asked something about 20020801 as this is not directly quoted in the white paper \(but is the hash\-cash paper publication date, that is indeed referenced\). A guy hypothesis is that the fact that the two 0s are the beginning indicate the fact the we should reverse the number thus becoming 12121200, is we consider it to be in a ternary system and we convert it to binary we get 111111111111, twelve ones. This could mean we need to look for 12 words. But this is not related to 20020801 so to me doesn't make any sense, but was the best idea i found.
My brain is frying, hope this helps someone

This looks cool! Is it open-source?

If you want to sell for fiat and not for good you understand nothing of bitcoin

Can I sell my boxes outside of amazon and let them handle the logistics? Or can I sell through amazon and accept Bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:54:43
Correct, but people think of "cash" that is physically in their wallet, and, as a consequence they think money in the bank are in their bank accounts, most don't even know that depositing money in a bank account means lending money to the bank!

Mr. Nakamoto stayed anonymous to prevent his opinion being too important on the project, to let it be as decentralised as possible and to allow it to change based on the community opinion. So in a sense Bitcoin is precisely how nakamoto wanted it to be

Finally we can use bitcoins in real world and price is falling, humans are strange creatures
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:53:35
That will be only possible when and if bitcoin will reach the popularity gold has, and I have no idea when this will happen. Maybe next world financial crisis could be the time
