If you want the basics, just watch the part between 01:27 - 12:49.
The rest of the video goes on to cover things like; where bitcoins come from, transaction fees, decoding transaction data, and signing transactions.
It's not a short video, but it's aimed at anyone who's interested in working with actual bitcoin data. I don't think I could have covered that stuff in less time.

I know you probably haven't got time right now to watch an hour long video on one small part of Bitcoin. However, I thought it might be worth a bookmark if you've ever wanted to know what terms like `P2PKH` and `P2SH` really mean.
In summary, this video contains lots of **animations** to show you how _Script_ (a mini-programming language in Bitcoin) works to **lock and unlock your bitcoins**.

I would put my username and/or email next to the coins in the photograph, and I could verify I am the owner by sending an email/message to the buyer using either of these accounts.
If anyone else tried to use the image, they would not be able to do this second step as they would not have access to these accounts.
It wouldn't all rest on this picture in the Datacoin blockchain, but I'm hoping it would help. Having the transaction ID at hand might also be easier than having to trawl through my old posts and buying history for evidence.

Didn't think of that.
The only problem is that I'm hesitant to "taint" the transactional history of the coins. I know it's much of a muchness, but I like the idea that the underlying BTC has been undisturbed. I think that could play a role in a Casascius coin's valuation in the future.

Probably true to be honest. "Bitcoin" and "offshore tax haven" are a pinch sensational, but there's no doubt that crypto creates an opportunity for you to put distance between your money and the government's grasp.
I like to believe that humans are generally pretty good though. So just because you can dodge tax, it's negative to think that everyone will.

The Doge community are supporting Bitcoin whether they realise it or not. The best thing is though, I think they all do realise it.
Bitcoin is the backbone, and Doge is a funnel for the money in the form of a fun meme. It's attracting a new community in to crypto-currency, and that's just fucking excellent.
Will it last? I don't know, and I don't think it really matters. They're spreading awareness of crypto in a fun package, and we should be thankful about that.

Thanks to crypto, banks will lose their hold on the movement of money. Governments work closely with banks, and if you no longer need to use a bank then it's no longer easy for the Government to see what you're doing.
That's the core benefit I'm looking at. By using a bank you're in the palm of their hand, but with crypto currency you're independent, and so are your records. That's a fundamental change in the system.
Sure, tracing could be improved, but so could the technology to make crypto untraceable. I think we're gaining more ground in one direction than we're losing in the other.

I'm not sure either. However, if you follow the path of any of the outputs locked to her address, you will see that they're from transactions where she has sent the majority of her bitcoins from her address back to the same address: 
Or in other words, she is taking 1200 and breaking it down slowly by sending small 0.5BTC amounts of it to different addresses over and over.
I'm guessing "chaining" is referring to sending bitcoins to yourself over and over again in a series of transactions. I haven't heard the term before though.
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:03:07
Thank you :)
@_date: 2017-02-26 17:02:56
Me again.
So with this transaction... It's a transaction that has the exact same raw transaction data structure, and this miner used it as their coinbase transaction to claim the block reward in two different blocks?
If so, it's possible for different transactions to have the same TXID, but only if they are coinbase transactions claiming block rewards?
@_date: 2015-01-10 22:54:06
Perfect, thank you sir.
@_date: 2017-02-12 18:05:50
I know there is a block browser called ABE:  I don't know of any tools that allow you to follow the path of transactions though.
I agree. I thought this tool would help with personal privacy, and take it out of the hands of "fraud detection" services that only service big companies.
I'm open to anyone helping me work on the website. The plan is still to make it open source eventually.

Nothing tastes better than a salty opinion!


My reason for the vague opener is as a stepping stone. Just want to go for the most basic explanation I can think of to start with, then break it up from there. I can see how it might be almost redundantly basic though, ha. I'll keep this in mind.


Good idea. Just added a more useful explanation to it.


Do you mean like a spinner? I have felt it runs a little slow, which doesn't help. Thanks for confirming that it wasn't just me who thought it might be easily missed.


A tooltip is a great idea. I was 50/50 about the image vs. interactive data at the top too. But went for an image because it's consistent with other pages, and because I thought having a block of monospace hex-data might be intimidating to have as the first thing you see on the page. But yes, tooltip.
**Tip: The interactive raw data thing also works on any transaction in the browser:** 
Thanks again. It's really useful to know how the page is seen from someone who isn't me.

Thank you btcdrak, I appreciate it.

**Quick explanation:**
Someone is making a fairly simple bitcoin transaction, but and has set the fee to 0.4 BTC. This works out to be a fee/byte **0.00029197**.
However, according to the transactions currently in the [candidate block]( you could get in to the next block with a fee/byte of **0.00000407**.
So by hard coding a fixed fee of 0.4BTC, they are spending _71 times_ the amount in fees they need to. In other words, instead of paying **$1,720** (0.4 BTC) in fees, they could be paying **$24** (0.0055 BTC).
@_date: 2019-11-04 16:40:03
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:43:27
I don't use Coinbase myself, but as far as I'm aware they do not offer the luxury of being able to set your own fee on the transactions you make.
@_date: 2017-01-31 12:37:48
Here's a gif: 
And here's a tool where you can see the results of "mining" a block for yourself: 
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:07:53
Your theory makes sense. However, it looks as though blocks are being mined in almost 10 mins exactly (average) since the last difficulty change, so I don't think the difficulty increase has slowed down miners, yet.
**Source:** 
@_date: 2017-01-23 16:50:27
When miners include transactions in blocks, they try and claim as many fees as possible before filling up the size of the block. So they select the transactions that give them the most "fees per byte" of data.
Currently, the lowest fee per byte transaction being included in a candidate block looks to be:
    0.00000064
Whereas the fee per byte for you transaction was:
    0.00000050
... so it wasn't being selected for inclusion in a block, because there were more valuable transactions to choose from.
It doesn't matter now, as it appears that your transaction has been mined. But in future, if you want to be sure that your transaction gets mined relatively quickly, you will want to make sure that the `fee per byte` for the transaction is greater than the lowest `fee per byte` transaction being included in candidate blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-30 08:15:02
For anyone who would like to see this data for themselves (from the blocks on their own computer):
`hexdump -C -s 8 -n 285 ~/.bitcoin/blocks/blk00000.dat`
**Note:** This prints the first block in hexadecimal, including any ASCII text.
**Note 2:** It only works on Linux.

@_date: 2017-01-18 11:54:16
I wrote a technical guide to bitcoin for beginners: 
I also made a visual block explorer, which should help with showing how the parts of bitcoin fit together and work: 
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:52:28
This block explorer is reading the timestamp included inside the header of the block.
When a miner constructs a block, they set this timestamp themselves. They can actually set this time **up to 2 hours ahead of the current time** if they like, which means block timestamps are not precise (nor do they need to be).
The order of the blocks is what matters. So even though **340,509** has a time _after_ the next block in the chain, it was still mined first, but its timestamp was set slightly ahead of time by the miner.
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:07:14
Don't think it's Silk Road. Originally looks like they were owned by someone with the vanity address of GMaxweLL: 
If you follow the 40k from that transaction (click the outputs), you get to the transaction you linked to. It's a short series of transactions.
Basically, someone who owns that address was able to unlock coins from that address, as well as another address that held the 40,000, in the same transaction. So they must have owned both (at least 4 years ago anyway).
EDIT: Thanks to u/mrchaddavis (and gmaxwell) I'm now aware that different people can safely sign different inputs of a transaction.

I've got a simple block explorer that shows unconfirmed segwit transactions.
You can see the ones in the mempool here: 
The segwit transactions have a little icon next to them (and as you can see, the majority of transactions entering the mempool are not using segregated witness).
@_date: 2017-01-24 01:45:07
Ha, thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:05:35
It looks like your transaction was just missing out on getting in to a block.
Your fee/byte was 0.00000199, and the lowest fee/byte in about the 10 blocks before it was literally around 0.00000200.
Your Transaction:  (hover over the fee at the bottom)
Block it got included in: 
Block around the time you made the transaction: 
If you scroll to the bottom of the block around the time you made the transaction (and hover over the bottom transaction), you will see that the lowest fee/byte was 0.00000220.
I'm guessing your wallet put a low estimate on the fee, and then lots of competing transactions came in shortly after.
@_date: 2017-01-24 01:49:36
I like your theory, but I'm not sure miners have slowed down. If so, the time between mined blocks would go up, but it has been **averaging _~10.31_ mins between blocks since the last difficulty change**, which isn't too far off the 10 minute mark.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:23:45
Re-using the same address doesn't actually consolidate your coins as you hope.
When you create a transaction, the change output is still a new output. It doesn't matter whether you lock it to a new address or the original sending address -- it's still a new output created from the one you just spent.
By sending change to the same address, it doesn't "return the bitcoins" back to the output that you just spent... you're still creating a new output for your change.
So there is no downsides to creating a new address for your change. Only the upside of extra privacy.
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:36:49
It looks like it's confirmed now.
However, for the last 5 blocks the lowest fees being included in the block were greater than 250 sat/byte (in the region of 251-267 sat/byte). So it looks like you transaction was out-competed by other transactions for a few hours.
If you hover over the transactions in the block just before your transaction was mined, you can see that the lowest fees (ones toward the bottom) were literally 1 sat/byte greater than yours (251 sat/byte): 
I'm guessing your wallet under-estimated the fee ever so slightly.
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:26:02
Well, that's thoroughly interesting. Consider my assumption of Gmaxwell owning those coins as completely wrong.
@_date: 2016-11-22 08:54:02
So if you're a miner and want to construct a candidate block, would you still simply collect transactions from the memory pool as before, and stop before you exceed 3MB?
@_date: 2016-11-22 08:52:26
Thank you.


Does this mean:
    1) Multiply the size (in bytes) of the raw transaction data (without witness data) by 3.
    2) Add all the raw transaction data again (plus withess data).
    3) If this is less than 4,000,000, the block is within its _weight_ limit.
(I'm not sure how the weight limit works with regards to raw transaction data.)
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:39:52
I would guess this transaction was made by hand.
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:56:31
Miners set the timestamp on the block. They do not have to be accurate.

Ah okay, got it. Sorry!
For what it's worth, I'm parsing transactions from raw transaction data, and I'd like to gather addresses where possible. I heard the presence of OP_CHECKMULTISIG means that there are addresses that can be found.
Your transaction is a perfect example. Thanks for the link.

Wow, very nice. That's a clever idea to turn hashes in to hex-value colors; I've not seen that anywhere before.
The site loads really fast for me. May I ask what programming language(s) you used to build the site? Also, what database do you use?
Nice work!
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:06:35
Although it seems as though a $2 fee should get through to the blockchain, it's not always the _absolute value of a fee_ that counts. It's actually the **fee per byte** that matters.
Your transaction is a piece of data that takes up space in a block, so when miners create a block of transactions, they fill it with transactions that will give them the most in fees for the bytes of space they are using up.
So for example, a $1 fee on a 250 byte transaction is tastier than a $2 fee on a 1000 byte transaction.
If you give us the TXID (Transaction ID), we can take a look at the fee/byte for it and see if it's lower than other transactions trying to be added to the blockchain at the moment.
In general, your wallet takes care of setting a reasonable fee/byte for the transactions you make. It may be that your wallet didn't set it high enough when it constructed your transaction.
But again, if we can see the TXID we can give you a better idea of what's going on.
@_date: 2019-08-08 15:42:31
Interesting, thank you. I'll see if I can find out more.

I've also quickly described a 51% attack in the README:

I've browsed the coinbase strings of the first 150,000 blocks and I can't see any mention of "stratum" or "slush" before Eligius. Unless the only way to identify earlier pools is by the bitcoin address used to claim the block reward.
If you interested/bored, here's a text dump of all the blocks and their coinbase strings (including who I've identified as the miner): 
@_date: 2016-11-10 23:07:26
Thank you sir.
@_date: 2016-11-08 10:16:03
Thank you, once again.
Would I need to parse the scriptSig (input) as well as the scriptPubKey (output)? If this is the scriptPubKey for the tx you gave me:
    04fcf07bb1222f7925f2b7cc15183a40443c578e62ea17100aa3b44ba66905c95d4980aec4cd2f6eb426d1b1ec45d76724f26901099416b9265b76ba67c8b0b73d 0202be80a0ca69c0e000b97d507f45b98c49f58fec6650b64ff70e6ffccc3e6d00 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG
Then I can convert those two pubkeys in to addresses (without the need for the scriptSig).
Are there any situations where the scriptPubKey has hidden addresses, but the scriptSig reveals them?
Also, here's a diagram I've made for scriptPubKey patterns where I've been able to gather addresses so far:

I think this is what you're looking for: [
Here's a short demo of it in action: [
@_date: 2019-08-08 13:37:00
Yep, nice spot. I didn't identify all of GHash's blocks with this chart (they didn't always put their name inside the block, but used the same address instead).
Here's the updated chart: 
Thank you.
@_date: 2019-08-08 13:31:17
Nice spot. I actually didn't identify all of GHash's blocks correctly with this chart. Here's an updated version: 
Typical that I failed to fully identify all the blocks by the miner with one of the most famous moments in Bitcoin's history, ha.
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:38:57
I mean by mining two blocks in quick succession so that other nodes on the network will perform a chain reorganisation, deactivating the top block in their chain and replacing it with a block I mined. This block will contain a different transaction to the one in the block they deactivated, effectively reversing that transaction.
@_date: 2016-11-07 15:11:41
I thought that OP_CHECKMULTISIG was used in the scriptPubKey, but it seems that it is only used in scriptSig.
Thanks for clearing that up.
@_date: 2019-08-08 13:33:07
Yep nice spot, thanks. Here's the updated chart: 
@_date: 2019-08-08 13:35:26
Thank you!
I used [bitcoin-iterate]( to get the data, Python+Matplotlib to make the charts, then [Gifsicle]( to turn it in to an animation.
You can see all the code here: 
@_date: 2019-08-08 13:28:13
Thanks, didn't think of that.
I went for the pie chart as I thought it would be the best way to visually represent when a single miner was approaching 50%, which can be seen by a 180 degree angle.
I couldn't think of a better chart that made 50% more obvious.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:00:21
This is a nice video.
I made this particular video for people who are interested in **working with bitcoin**, and want to know how block _mining_ works. So if you're interested in getting started with coding bitcoin stuff, you will hopefully find it useful.
But if you prefer a higher-level overview of Bitcoin in general, the video you linked to is good.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:01:05
What trouble are you having with the audio? Is it too quiet?
It doesn't seem to bad for me, but this is my first attempt at making a video and I'd like to improve the audio for the next one.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:53:04
Okay thank you. Didn't realize the sound was so quiet, but that can be easily fixed. The audio during the questions is definitely fuzzy, but thought I'd just upload and hope it wasn't too annoying as the questions are infrequent.
Yep, I noticed my own "ums" too. It's definitely a classroom-style video as opposed to a fine-tuned quick explanation.
Thanks for your feedback. Given me a few things to think about for future videos. Thanks.

Memory pools have around 35,000 transactions at the moment.
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:43:47
Might these 18 have a special importance?
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:24:51
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:43:14
Wouldn't it be more effective to mine a block without any transactions from the mempool?

Bitcoins basically just get passed from one person to another.
For example, a 1 Dollar note gets passed from person to person. An "unspent bitcoin" is just like a dollar note, and this tool gives you information about the location of each note.

I've got a simple block explorer that I think does what you're looking for. For example: [ (hover over the block to see a tooltip with the block depth)
Or are you looking for something different?

Thanks. Any reason why P2PKH wasn't used more in coinbase transactions?
Was it because miners had their code set up and running with P2PK and didn't want to risk changing anything?

Sure, it could be a waste of time. Having said that, the opportunity to follow the coins is still there. For some, having this opportunity may be better than having no opportunity at all.

If it's any help, I've made a blockchain explorer that allows you to easily follow the path of bitcoins. Here is your transaction:
If you keep clicking on the outputs you can see where they are going. It looks like this person is currently splitting up the coins in a series of transactions.
It won't necessarily allow you to identify the person, but it does allow you to follow the path of the stolen coins to see where they are on the blockchain.
Best of luck.

You could make a note of the addresses that they end up at. If one of those addresses gets linked to an identity, you may be able to track the thief.
It far from guarantees you from finding anything, but in the very least it gives you the opportunity to follow the movement of the coins. It may be no help at all, but it's something.
@_date: 2018-03-10 10:00:10
**1)** Yes, your seed is like your private key. Your seed is a source of randomness that the wallet uses to create your private key. It's a bit like a "master private key".
**2)** If you've got a _private key_, you can unlock your funds from any wallet. You should be able to import the private key in to the wallet, and it will show you all the bitcoins that are locked to that private key's address.
Basically, your funds don't actually live inside of a wallet. Instead, your wallet just holds your private keys, and these keys give you access to bitcoins that are stored on the blockchain.
**3)** If you have got a **seed** instead of a _private key_, you may only be able to import that seed in to a wallets of the **same program**. But still, you can run the program on a different computer, import the seed, and get access to your bitcoins.
Different programs may have different methods of creating private keys from seeds, which is why you may have to use the same program.
Does all that make sense?
Also, your English is fine :)
@_date: 2017-10-04 09:50:02
Yeah it's normal, although uncommon.
After a quick browse I can't see any blocks in recent history that took quite this long to mine... 
Nonetheless, even with the 1+ hour wait for this block, the _average_ time between blocks has been **~8.74** mins since the last target adjustment: 
So things are perfectly normal.

Thanks, I can see that the hashing does shorten it noticeably, and then the base58 helps with the transcription.
I still don't fully understand the *security* aspect though. Is tthe address more "public" than the public key in everyday use, so hashing it gives the public key a layer of protection from the address?
P.S. Happy cakeday and all that shit.

Well, this is beyond any kind of stuff I have done, so I'm not in a position to give much advice! Nonetheless:
* I would try and change the x-axis to something like "X hours ago" instead of "2017-05-21 02:26", because that's what I'm trying to do in my head when I read the current x-axis labels.
* Why triangles? I'm guessing they display better than lots of overlapping circles?
Other than that, it really is great. Are you adding all the latest transactions to your own database?

Why not average yourself in?
Let's assume you're deliberating buying $1000 of BTC over the next 5 days.
Instead of buying $1000 on one of those days, buy $200 each day for 5 days and you'll have the average for that time period. You avoid committing your money when the price is at its extremes.
It doesn't protect you from a large correction that takes place outside of this time frame, but it does soften your entry.

Not really an awesome answer, but...
If you're on Linux you can use a handy little program called **youtube-dl**. It downloads videos (or just the audio) from youtube.
If you're using Ubuntu/Linux Mint (&lt;- highly recommed), typing this in to a terminal will install youtube-dl and dowload an m4a audio file for this video:
    sudo apt-get install youtube-dl

UK guy from localbitcoins here. 100+ transactions, 150+ BTC. Made £5,000+ single transactions.
Never had a bad trade. A handful have been slow, but even if someone can only release the following day (due to offline Internet banking) they have always followed through.
Buying and selling to the people on localbitcoins.com has been a positive experience. People there just want to buy and sell bitcoins and get involved. Most people are on the ball with transfers, some enjoy a chat.
I was obviously cautious about my first few trades, but I quickly found out that the Bitcoin community is a good one.

Getting involved in the hype and excitement is good fun, but don't become absorbed by it.
Sometimes I get stuck in the emotional swings, and there's no benefit to it. Too much of it feels like a waste of time when I could be doing more productive things related to Bitcoin.
I try to spend time learning about how Bitcoin works and browse around the related economics of it all. I'm taking this opportunity to learn about something interesting, and at the same time use this to remind myself about why I'm buying bitcoins in the first place.
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:12:18
These videos are generally good and also cover some economic stuff:
 - Can't go wrong with Khan Academy. Easy to recommend, but it is good.
 - A bit slow, but thorough.
 - Better than they look.
There's a lot of cross-over in the content, but it's good to learn from a variety of perspectives.

@_date: 2013-12-06 13:21:01
I don't think Bitcoin's success is dependent upon governments embracing it off the bat. There will be resistance, which is natural as governments are going to be concerned about something that will affect the economic system they're familiar with. Money is power after all, so it's a good idea to keep a lid on it until you know how to handle/squash it.
Bitcoin completely kicks the shit out of fiat currencies for a variety of online transactions. It has some marvelous properties. This will lead to huge adoption when it becomes easier for the average person to acquire BTC.
When the average person uses and truly understands the practical benefits of Bitcoin, governments will have to work around it. We're not hoping for Bitcoin to work around governments - understanding and adoption will force their hand.

Probably because the other guy is new to bitcoin, and so the sub wanted to give him a warm reception.
You're already on the inside, and thus the community doesn't greatly benefit from showing an equal amount of warmth. It doesn't send out as much of a useful signal to other reddit communities.

I agree. I think Bitcoin will create an environment where people want to fund good ideas, which is like intelligent wealth allocation.
Being "sold" to is such an exploitative model. Companies try and pry your money from you by dressing up their goods and services through advertising.
Bitcoin makes it easier to donate and move money in to ideas that deserve them. I think of Bitcoin as a monetary system without the shackles created by banks. Open-source will benefit, which I think would be amazing.
Developments can be made by people who want to make the world better, and they can be funded for their work. This is in contrast to the current system that rewards money-making, where creating a useful service is a stepping stone to the goal of profit.
Public companies and shareholders (people who love money) =&gt; open source projects and Bitcoin funding (people who love ideas).
