maybe Mark Karpeles knows more? 
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:38:35
so you are acomplice to the theft or why are you so eager to praise the clueless PR-man? 
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:44:33
So when everyone knows who is responsible, then why are they trying to deflect responsibility? Wether one can make it right or not is another question.

What "token" is everyone talking about? I hope i'm not given some shitcoin to represent the debt! I want an orderly display in my account of how much bfx owes me and a regular interval payment directly in my account to pay the debt down. I certainly don't want shittokens - AT ALL. So what's up with "pos-token"? Can someone enlighten me? Don't wanna go through 1000 posts to find out.  
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:11:03
dunno, hope you're right. I still don't see a reason why my dollar-denominated debt should be converted to some other denomination; it shouldn't. With or without blockchain. I don't want anything else, just dollar or real btc as alternative. I'll accept no other repayment. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:34:58
That was their plan all along, wasn't it? 
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:36:10
So we stop trading now? Let the public know "bitcoin trading is not possible without high risk of total loss ON TOP of the risk of volaility and your own computer security"? Ok, guys, you heard it: stop trading because only morons do that. Once you send your  coins to an exchange nobody is responsible for them anymore from now on. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:41:17
yeah, at least the communication is ok in this case. Hope we can get funds back.  
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:36:39
yeah, now processing. I'll sacrifice a chicken and a haleluja to satoshi when i have my money out - i won't ever be back. The exchange is run by criminals. Karpeles eventually sits in the backoffice.  Give me my money, finex and go fuck yourself! 
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:44:36
the token will be 100% certain traded below face value because at face value people sell it, do you get it? The price will be what people aren't ready to sell at anymore. Could well be somewhere between 30 and 60 cents. This has nothing to do with betting on finex but with the simple fact that real money is better than debt. 
As a reminder: bfx can't be counted on to support the price because if they could they wouldn't need to issue the token in the first place. I'm telling you again: it's 100% certain this shitcoin will plummet like a rock - it's insult upon insury. I'm totally against the idea of trading that debt in a market because the debt will be devalued immediately. 
If the debt gets traded in a market people should and will sue. You think we're stupid or what? 
I don't care if they need two years to pay it back and i don't care about interest but i do care about wether my owed money gets devalued up to 80% immediately or not which will be with 100% certainty the case if it's traded in a market. Who the fuck should support the price of that token? Nobody, that's who - at least not close to face value. It'll be traded way below face value forever. I don't need that shit.  First we've got to bail out the btc holders, then you devalue the debt. What a great idea! I had USD in the exchange, not shitcoins. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 05:20:00
Just stay out. Btc isn't tradeable over the internet without being whiped out once in a while. You just waste your time. It makes more sense to spin on your own axis until you feel a little sick - it's more fun too. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:24:53
the list is MUCH longer 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:08:02
Withdrawals aren't working as promised - and bfx token trades at 20 cents as predicted. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:35:51
read this carefully: bitgo advertised '100% security' and then they co-signed a tx for 190k btc. Wether they were insured or not is entirely their own problem. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:07:00
Why are withdrawals not enabled? 
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:36:40
I think it would be better to give them a chance to recapitalize and continue operations - if that works out mabe we can get it all back over time? 'Haircut' should mean "involuntary loan that's being payed back" not "taking a complete loss" i assume. That might need clarification. 
If you're not satisfied you could still sue. Doesn't need to force them in bankruptcy. I'm also strongly for slaughtering biotgo first. Pretty sure we can liquidate bitgo. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:03:40
exactly 
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:00:56
It's a myth. Nothing is confirmed. We're all on 'processing' status. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:22:13
Why still use them? Their CEO has time and time again shown how incompetent he is. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:31:55
Excuse me? They plan on giving me a shitcoin instead of an orderly display of debt in my account and a regular pay-down? 
I tell you how that pans out: the shitcoin is being dumpen and bfx gonna act as if the dumping of the shitcoin was them legitimately getting rid of the debt. That debt-token is a ridiculous idea, actually illegal. 
People will sue. 
I absolutely don't want a depreciating debt-token! Handing me that token instead of a orderly regular payment to my account is theft. 
Such token has close to zero value in a market. I don't need interest, i just need my money back. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 11:02:10
bitgo signed my money away. I'm sure i can sue and win. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 22:33:17
It is an inside job until proven otherwise

No whale in their right mind buys those shittoken because they represent nothing

yes, there are profitable traders, even if you sucker can't believe that... and many of them are leaving now for good.  Coinbase will be next on the list ... have fun holding an untradable asset. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:47:05
Some US-citizen should in fact inform the authorities before the bitgo-crew is in the philippines. Don't trust bitfinex when they say they had informed and are working with authorities. That might not be true. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:29:23
Now outages, 502s ... the paint comes off the walls, really.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:06:12
selling share-token to recapitalize is a pretty good idea. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:32:38
They will do that once they bought out all the suckers. Everything goes as they planned. I think we see bfx-tokens at close to 1$ next week and them slapping an interest rate on it should be expected too. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:09:12
If they get away with taking no responsibility then soon trading will be nowhere safe anymore. imo bitgo needs to pay the lionshare of the damage; not the users or finex. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 10:07:39
I don't see why it needs to be traded. A blockchain just adds a lot of risks and huge room for more fraud. Who makes sure the distribution of the token is legit? Nobody, that's who. What's the issue with display the debt in my account (with no token attached) and bfx pay that down over time. They could issue a token for fee-shares to get in money more quickly but, man i do not consent to my USD-debts being put on a blockchain and traded in a market. This smells like scam right from the start. 1$ in bfx debt could turn out to be 30 cents, you see? bfx owes me and nobody else, i don't want to sell the debt for a discount, i want 100% back. At the very least that token should be optional. I shouldn't be forced into such a shady scheme if i don't want to. If they make it optional for me (to be able to convert debt tied to my account to bfx token if i want to) then nobody would have an issue but to just say "you get shitcoins for your USD wether you want it or not and the market will decide the value of your debt wether you agree or not" is crap and highly illegal. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:36:06
what's new here is: nobody seems to take any responsibility. If they get away with not being held responsible kiss all your bitcoin and all your exchanges goodby because suddenly everyone is insolvent or hacked and not responsible. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:20:00
you sir have no clue
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:49:04
The money is lost - it has to come from somewhere. Lawsuits might happen either way or maybe not even if they are successfull to recapitalize  and pay back a good amount relatively quickly. I think if the CEO did not actually selfhack there should be a good chance for us to get a decent amount back. There are a lot of avenues for recapitalisation imo. I think if we assume it wasn't a selfhack we can still be optimistic.

people should get together and in fact sue bitgo in one big case IMHO. Bitfinex could be on the side of the offensive in that case. It's bitgo against everyone else. Get a lawsuit against bitgo going, people.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:39:18

It's not a share in the company - gosh someone make it rain brain 
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:41:15
let finex recapitalize, share the losses and we'll liquidate bitgo in court to help cover the losses. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:32:48
If finex doesn't come up with a satisfactory roadmap to bring some of the funds back to us there is no other choice. Let's wait and see if they bring a solution that is acceptable for most people. If not, then there won't be any other avenues to take. Sure you don't get it all back that way but better than being left out in the rain entirely. I'm sure we all got better things to do so let's hope finex comes up with something acceptable before going all out on this one. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:37:20
bitgo is fully liable but you'll only get them in a court because they won't liquidate themselves and hand it over voluntarily. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:09:46
yeah, there is no right to demand to socialize losses. You can demand your money back but you can't demand other users to pay that. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:31:59
That's for a judge to decide who is liable for what. Your opinion on this is relatively irrelevant.

It is as easy to get as newton physics and it's even older than that. Supply/demand is no rocket science. It won't be different this time. Sure your IQ is lower than mine, but please think a little bit more so you can have some success in life. There is no point in doing a practical experiment when the theoretical one already miserably fails. Also it disgusts me when people try to make stupid experiments with MY money. Why don't you run with your head against the wall for experimenting? That's maybe new too?  Hyperactivist neophiles are disgusting. The lack of conservatism and the amount of fake progressivism will ruin the entire space. All the scammers are now dressed up as experiment-conducting professors.  
Sorry for being rude but i'm tired of it. All i'm saying is: don't put debt on a Blockchain and don't trade that debt in a market. It'll fail if you do and people who suffer losses from it will sue.

Lol, and that money was taxed before and will be taxed afterwards on top of inflation. Pathetic. Worse than your average altcoin scam. 
Someone tell them it's going to backfire. Even if they ban gold the money will just go outside the country. I don't think the upper class will be having that.

"on the couch"? Why is his financials even her business? I'd send that bitch to work if she thought it's not enough. He's better off without that shallow golddigger. He ignored rule  which is: don't talk with your wife about financials and in particular not about coins or trading. It's none of her business. She better produce an income herself when she thinks she needs to put you on the couch over bitfinexs' fault. lol, bitches. Life is much easier without a naging bitch in your house. MUCH better. Women are liabilities and depreciate pretty quickly. Women are like shitcoins: nothing to hold longterm or believe in, highest volume when they're new, later nobody cares. Bascially all of them a scam -&gt; Pump and dump
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:59:43
btc never leave the blockchain - they aren't "stored" - my money was signed over to someone else by bitgo (and bfx - both used a key) without my permission. 
And actually i don't give a flying fuck what you think. The lawyers will sort that out. I'll inform interpol if i don't get access to my account within a reasonable time.

@_date: 2016-08-05 02:42:06
exactly. Finex could be on our side against bitgo and continue operation to generate fees and recapitalize. Bitgo should be the very first thing we attempt to liquidate to cover losses. They're not needed for anything anyways. I think you can get up to 100% of people involved behind a lawsuit against bitgo. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:32:00
bitgo will be sued later, no worries. They'll cover losses, believe me. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:28:03
yeah, he didn't handle security either. Why is nobody asking how much bitgo will take of the losses?
