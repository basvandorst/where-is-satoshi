Up front info:
- I'm new to BTC, but very excited by it
- I don't want to use BTC as an investment tool, but as something I make actual purchases with
- I have done a fair amount of research
I am thinking of operating two wallets, under the impression this will help with my security and organization of BTC transactions. One wallet would be my "vault", very secure and very little transaction activity. I would put BTC here that I plan on saving. The other would be my "spending" wallet, and I would like it to be more user friendly in terms of using BTC.
Is this a good idea? Or a useless one?
Quesiton 2:
I currently use a dumb phone that pretends to be smart. I can't run any apps or mobile wallets. As I look to use BTC as an average consumer, how important would a mobile platform for BTC be? (As a note, there are NO local shops that accept BTC in my area.)

So does this count as an official statement from the Feds that they acknowledge BTC as actual money and currency?

Thanks a lot for the links, and the useful info. A FAQ I read stated somewhere that running BitcoinQT helps the Bitcoin community as a whole, but if that's not entirely accurate I'm okay with switching to another wallet.

Has anyone ever found a comprehensive parts list and pcb schematic for these erupters?

As someone just getting into bitcoins I can understand this is frustrating to miners, but isn't this also a good thing?
By the increasing difficulty doesn't it also prevent inflation?
I guess it's a blessing in disguise that keeps the Bitcoin as a relevant form of digital currency and this increasing difficulty is just one of the safeguards that prevents it from becoming a runaway inflationary tool like fiat currency. So while it's bad for miners this should be a good thing for overall BTC users.

Thanks for these tips, and your advice makes me feel positive and confident in my attempt. I like the idea of using it like cash over the internet.
I especially see your point how using BTC will encourage others to spend the BTC they have. If there is a constant flow of BTC going around then people will be more confident they can always get it. At least that's how I'm interpreting it.
