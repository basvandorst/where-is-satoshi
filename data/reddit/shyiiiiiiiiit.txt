That is more user error than the hardware wallet failing.

Ultimately you have to trust yourself. Whether or not you took the best precautions and/or didn’t skip a step, whether or not you fully researched everything (and even then, trusting your sources).
It comes down to the user.

For them to do otherwise would be such a crime.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:01:27
Oh ok, thanks for the clarification. Disregard.

Should I sell or should I hodl?  
If I sell, there will be trouble  
If I don't, my profits double

He represents lots of negative shit outside crypto as well. How he looks down on/insults people based on their gross annual income. Like who gives a shit? And if you personally use that as an attack or a means to judge a person’s value in society then that shows a lot about your world view.

After you've set up a wallet, use its public address as the recipient when you're Sending from the Coinbase app/website.

As they say, you don't control your coins in an exchange's wallet.

World, this is why we have to stop bullying. It's clear Roger Ver was bullied and hurt in some way when he was young. Hate breeds hate, and he seems to be the product of it. End bullying today.

I don't see how this wouldn't be the first option to consider anyway. It's not like if this project came to fruition, we'd expect a custom launcher, lander, and what have you.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:36:33
Too soon.

Don't call it AUnlimited or he will go ape shit and start asking you about your gross annual income.

W-wait what? Ledger servers?! Nahh man, back to the tech-dojo with you, relearn that tech-fu of yours.

Isn't this what we wanted?  delete your accounts, etc? Maybe BoA got wind of the BCH rollout/"insider trader" accusations and said "Naw, I'm good."

Only a Sith deals in abso-... Yeap, no surprise here. Ver is a fucking Sith.

Hey at least you're honest!

And thanks to Ashit Pie, that won’t be anytime soon.

Is there any way to increase the tx fee? Even though I put High Priority when I sent from my wallet, it gave a tx fee of less than a dollar! wth.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:19:01
They support Dogecoin ;)
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:04:29
The sender actually sets the tx fee, but the higher it is the more of an incentive for miners to confirm that transaction onto the next block. So if you're not in a rush, you can set a low fee - but if you want to be confirmed ASAP, higher (incentive) fee.

Just an upvote would’ve saved you more! �� could’ve put it towards more BTC

Correct me if I'm wrong, I've heard other stories of social engineered hacks through acquiring the cell phone number (of big YouTubers, then hacking their channel for example). Would someone be able to reset passwords if a 2FA app was used in conjunction?

You mean a dip for ETH? Because this is 300.

I still don't understand why that sub is not called r/BCH instead.
there is a r/BCH.... Oh boy this civil war is so confusing.

So you'll never sell your crypto for fiat then?

Are you on the right chain? Legacy or Segwit?
