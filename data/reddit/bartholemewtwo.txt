Good advice! Cross posted for more visibility. Everything is on the up and up, I assure you. I wasn't trying to 'force' a transaction, I thought my internet was being shite. This is my first problem in three years. u/coinbase_kyle u/coinbase_rae

I've been attempting to get access to my account for over 10 days but I appreciate your cynicism. You must be great at parties.

That's not an issue on my end thanks for the heads up

Good advice. If you receive the product, even late, charge backs are a big no-no.

My problem is that I haven't been able to get in touch with support for over a week and a half. My account wasn't triggered for fraud, the bot locked my account because it misunderstood my question. Question being, literally, "I did an instant debit buy, not a bank purchase, why did it default to a bank purchase?"
I'm not going to feed you any further. I'm looking for a solution, not a situation in which I have to defend my actions against a nobody.

I will look into it. Do they offer instant buy? How long until I am able to trade with my deposits?

I didn't want to store anything, I wanted to buy a little coin before the moon!

Hear hear!

Sound advice!

Lots of states have ID cards that don't expire. Some military ID cards don't expire until you are eligible for medicare! But what you're saying makes sense.

Silver lining!

My (amazing) bank associates with them so they have my trust. This situation has soured my taste though. Our relationship has been great for 3 or so years. I wonder if their customer base has outgrown their capabilities?
