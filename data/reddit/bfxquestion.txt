Hello to 'no margin available' :)
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:51:19
That would result in infinite leverage, so probably not

Are you insane? Enabling trading of bfxcoin without any info on the payment plan, what can be done with it, etc?
It seems as if an important part of your payment plan consists of buying bfxcoin for next to nothing :/
@_date: 2016-08-16 17:03:47
Ok that's very surprising to me. Unless he clearly intended it as an temporary emergency measure that's not very visionary of him.

A smart sociopath is the most dangerous person to trust.  
A smart and honest person would clearly commit to make everyone whole. A simple rule like 'one bfxcoin entitles you to x% of monthly fees on the bitfinex platform' would mean that, with clear payment rules and timetable. In the event of recovery of y% stolen property bitfinex commits to allow redeeming each bfxcoin for y% of $1, starting from one week after the stolen funds returns to their control. Something else about outside investment or sale. Simple rules. Perhaps with disclaimer that if you accept your bfxcoins you forfeit your right to sue for losses.  
That would build trust, not current BS.

The original Bitcoin by Satoshi allowed **trustless** bitcoin transactions on sidechains, although they had to be similar to Bitcoin. Unfortunately Bitcoin devs did  everything in their power to stop that. Not only are basic script ops disabled for made up reasons (like OP_LEFT, OP_XOR and others - apparently they are too complicated to be made bugfree - but astronomically more complicated changes like SegWit are planned for inclusion), also as an additional resort broadcast of uncommon transactions was disabled. 
If all this scaling debate was really about differences in technical opinions about blocksize, security, bandwidth or  storage, bitcoin wouldn't get artificially hampered to make competition with trustless sidechains impossible. Perhaps even some additional OP support could get added to make it easier. Most people would use bitcoin on unlimited, trustless and nearly free sidechains while core blocks would be small and free from "spam". 
Full turing complete languages have that automatically - it's always going to be possible to verify arbitrary blockchains on ethereum, so if ethereum stops evolving it's going to get outcompeted very easily.

There's nothing complex about bitshifts. 
Regarding Ethereum, Solidity is a badly designed language for its purpose. There's nothing insecure in a turing complete language itself. In fact a very basic turing complete language would be drastically *simpler* than current bitcoin scripts, although at a cost to transaction length. 
In the extreme case [one instruction is enough]( It's almost impossible to introduce a non-obvious bug in something that simple.

Street dealers suck.

Sadly with 1MB blocks bitcoin is becoming increasingly useless for low value transaction. Funnily enough this is actually within the low range of international USD SWIFT wire fees, depending on the banks involved...
@_date: 2016-08-12 07:20:53
Fees are nonlinear. If you include all nonzero fees they are going to be minuscule and the total much smaller. Eventually security gets too low and you start getting long forks mined for nefarious purposes. So now too low fee miners lose everything and people's transactions gets fucked. 
So what everyone does is choose a shorter chain with higher per-block security with fake timestamps. No forks anymore. How to pay for that? Higher fees. Eventually that fork overtakes the rest. 
Does it work easily with current bitcoin just with no block limit? Only over really large periods of time or with extensive extra-protocol cooperation. But bitcoin already needs hardfork for any changes, so removal of block limit should add a fee/security market. To have a fee/security market you need forks! Otherwise you don't know when security gets too low. 
The other alternative is eternal significant block reward, perhaps as a function of forking difficulty, as a way to pay for security, and tx fees only for storage/bandwith.

Paying upfront is a terrible idea, every scammer in the world would say he has some info. 
If you really knew you would buy as many bfxcoins as possible once trading starts, then inform bitfinex and authorities. This way you also have plausible deniability.
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:37:41
I'm not even sure if that BS means they HAVE to return money if a miracle happens and a hacker gives it back, or do they have an OPTION of doing that lol. There's also nothing that specifies a time frame in that event, they could keep it for 100 years.  
As a general rule, the more complicated and harder to understand the legalese, the harder the other side is trying to fuck you. It's not accidental that the clearest rule from that is "The obligation evidenced by the token bears no interest and is not entitled to dividends, distributions, or other income amounts of any kind.".

Wrong in what? This average doesn't say anything about price and access to fiber internet in the city. For all I know outside of Seoul there's only shitty 2mbit adsl.

Does your grandma buys illegal substances from street dealers? In that case, yes.  
If not, no.

If it leads to repayment and criminal proceedings, 10% seems reasonable
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:12:46


The highest fee is 0.2% for the taker and 0.1% for the maker... their average fee is most likely 0.2% total or even lower.  
Your estimate is way too high. A realistic annual profit range is $6-$9 million. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:33:49


This has nothing to do with block size. If your argument is bandwidth, yes, you can't run a full node on a dial up or a satellite phone. You can get an unlimited 600mbits/100mbit fiber for like $30/month in most cities outside of third world, enough for even 1GB blocks. Wait a few years and that starts changing to 1Gb/1Gb. Storage wise, that would be only 52TB per year, feasible even for a hobbyist right now and trivial with decentralized storage.  


You know that miners can mine smaller blocks than allowed right? No hard limit at all means the market would find the perfect match of all factors. Too low fees would result in too low security which would result in orphans, which means wasted computations, which means the miners will self-limit the block size/minimal fees/ as to ensure they don't lose money. Pretty simple. 
I know it's all academic at this point as bitcoin is beyond saving.

Well he has a harder start obviously, but without government regulations and other arbitrary market barriers the average poor &amp; smart &amp; motivated kid will get rich too. By average I mean that obviously some will get sick when young and die, never getting a chance, and many variations of that, and the reverse, some will win a lottery etc. On average and over long term these variation cancel out resulting in near perfect meritocracy (assuming free market). 


Do you mean signature verification time? Not a problem, if gpus can mine they can verify.

I meant it in the sense that goxbtc were ridiculously overvalued on bitcoin builder because of delusion, greed &amp; hopium. Now it's 2.5 years since bankruptcy and still no payout, the haircut is likely to be in the 20%-30% range. Add time value of money + volatility risk and the then-sensible price was about 10%. So bfxcoin being initially ridiculously overvalued is within the realm of possibility.  
Fair valuation is definitely not a strong suit of crypto markets.
@_date: 2016-08-08 05:13:52
You would need a miracle for the price to stay above $0.1 in the initial period, there's no way it's worth that much.  
But then goxbtc was going for as high as 70% if I remember correctly, so who knows. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 17:20:09
Check your privilege shitlord. What is nothing to you is a month's savings for some poor kid in Zimbabwe trying to escape hyperinflation and horrible government, the guy who actually **needs** bitcoin for something else than buying drugs online. It's ok to charge true market rates for transactions, but hard limit is literally central planning with the same result as always - fucking everyone for a temporary benefit of a tiny elite. In the long run, everyone loses because there's much less total wealth creation.

Maybe it is, but that's definitely not necessary to get great quality, look at Romania.  
It's a complicated topic but in the case of dense populous cities I  suspect subsidies are only needed when other/previous government intervention/regulation made it impossible to compete with existing provider(s). 
Still that's beside the point. There are enough people and locations with cheap fiber to support very big blocks worldwide. Soon hundreds of millions as third world megacities jump from ~zero infrastructure to fiber. If it's inefficient in some location don't run full nodes there. Every place has some comparative advantage.

They are going to need these four decimal places if they start trading before explaining the payment plan
Unless buying it at 0.001 is the plan...

Do you live in the city proper or suburb? Most likely the latter.  America has actually very small cities. Did you know that San Francisco proper only has 864k people? 
[List of cities by density]( The first non-third world city, Seoul, [has 1Gbps net for $20]( Seoul has the ~same population as New York but is 8 times more dense. 
Americans collectively decided they prefer more living space at the expense of all efficiencies stemming from living in an actual city, one of which is a cheap fast internet.  
Local density is not everything, you need high enough absolute population numbers in that density, also a telecommunication company in a country where high density cities are the norm has national-level economies of scale.
