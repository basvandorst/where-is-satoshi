I bought one! Here is my review:

The reason I did the recovery was to test recovery while I was waiting. And it worked perfectly :-)

Awesome! Updated my blog post to reflect that

Already own a Trezor, but ordered one anyway.

Use several outputs. Might get expensive, though.

god, i remember that photo shoot like it was yesterday.

Andreas here. We removed personal info from the about page because too many people were calling us on our mobiles. We're super busy with sending out all the money and can't spend time on phone calls.

Andreas here. Thanks for all the support. We've worked day and night for this community for the last 1.5 years.
I've personally worked on Bitcoin projects since 2011 and still believe that Bitcoin is a fast and affordable way to send and store cash over the Internet.
I'll use my spare time in the coming weeks to open source several of the tools we've used to run Justcoin.

If the investment went towards paying developers to invent a protocol that can be used by Counterparty then it was certainly not wasted.

Why is this being downvoted? Block time and storage is important.

It definitely adds some sense of "physical security". At the same time, I'm concerned about the codes being printed by someone other than myself.

1) Block time of ~10 min makes the block chain unsuitable for this use. Imagine a computer that can only take one command every 10 min (worst case an hour)
2) Only 40 bytes[1] can be stored after OP_RETURN. This is 40 bytes: 0000000000111111111122222222223333333333. What can you store?

I always enjoy the interviews you give and look forward to reading the book (Kindle edition)
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:30:09
Bought one!

Enjoy my $23. King Of The Jungle Tee is the bomb.

If you're adamant about it, you can buy an Amazon gift card at Gyft using bitcoin. (I did)

This gone goes out to everyone who has been in this crazy experiment since $10. Multisig and HD wallets can get us out of this, but it will take time. Stay strong and HODL.
