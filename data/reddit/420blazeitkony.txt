Bitinstant uses the highest price in the previous 24 hour rolling period if I'm not mistaken. Even if you bought when they were $60, they could have cleared for over $80, the high for today. This happened to one of my housemates who got coin at $100 but they were $130 earlier. 
Also, if you need the money , why the hell are you buying in now? It's a bear market, highly speculative at the moment, and the mantra is ONLY SPEND WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. If you decide to play day trader, you may lose more, but if you must, go to bitcoin.clarkmoody.com, sell your coin if the buy wall is thin, wait for it to drop 10%, buy back in, repeat. DO NOT sell low and buy high. 
Also you could wait for them to go up more and cash out at coinbase.

Buy coins, send them to coinbase, transfer to your checking account. If you do it quickly enough, BTC will not change in the time of transaction.

Logarithmic plots are defined as each notch (such as 10e0 to 10e1) equivalent in percent change to the next notch (10e1 to 10e2). Both of these steps indicate a 1000% increase over a time period. Adding a second Y axis allows one graph to be normalized to the other, with Y increments on the second Y axis being proportional to percent change on the first Y axis. This analysis is only representing the eerily similar trend in proportional percent change over time.

RULE NUMBER ONE: DO NOT INVEST MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE!!!!
@_date: 2013-04-14 11:23:36
Fraud? THIS IS BITCOIN! Where the prices are made up, and the utility doesn't matter (for now at least).
The rule of speculation is you are scamming or you are being scammed. Just be smart about it.

bought a 4 ltc code on 4chan
I stopped reading there. Fake codes can ban you, even if they work.

Can I DO ME?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:42:35
no. I'm holding. There's no point risking this lag, especially when the price is still DOUBLE what it was on Monday. Most likely just a correction; bitcoin can't double every WEEK.

They still haven't made the chips. Have you seen avalon asic, the only REAL ASIC out at the moment? Butterfly looks nothing like. Also, where's a demonstration youtube video? Butterfly has produced ZERO videos demonstrating, it may be 6 months until they're done. They're scamming people because they are collecting money and lying that their product is right around the corner.
Or go ahead and throw $200 at them, not my loss.

Right now is Bitcoin MANIA. No one is sane. Wait 6 months and it will be calmer.

The only thing that matters is USA, Europe, China, Japan, and Korea.

You have to do the "deposit two &lt;$0.20 transactions to your checking account and tell us the amounts" and provide a picture of your drivers license. From there, you have to transfer money in, and then transfer to BitInstant.
Be advised, if started now, you'll be lucky to have your coins by Wednesday.

No , and you should NOT play that game.

Week 1: I bought a Bitcoin from them, got it for the price that day. 
Week 2: I bought another, got it for the price 3 DAYS LATER.
They're trollin bro. Welcome to bitcoin! Where the prices are made up, and the utility doesn't matter!
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:23:53
Have you ever made a purchase with them before?
How much did you purchase?
Did you purchase on Credit?
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:12:02
This. Also, how do you know that you're going to get the bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-16 09:59:56
kill yourself
@_date: 2013-04-15 10:45:49
Yeah, because "e-currency" was one of the drop down selections available when this was made.
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:56:37
That description is accurate for 90% of Bitcoin supporters.
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:59:26
Nope, it turns out bitcoin's a scam, everyone can sell now and get back to their lives. Bitcoin's over.

PPC =pointless-piece of shit coin, famous for its penny stock like pumps and dumps at btc-e.com.
Also, there are DOZENS of other cryptocurrencies:

According to:
You will get about 350 Mhash/s. I get about 250 Mhash/s from my 5830, and I make ~0.016 BTC a day, and that value decreases every day. This bearley coverts the electricity cost of a 300 W graphics card.
That link should help.

I would advise leaving your money with them until the BTC price stabilizes, and then try.

Bitcoin is equivalent to digital cash in the same way that email revolutionized sending messages. HOWEVER, Bitcoin may be the "myspace" or "napster" of this concept, and may fail.
Also, the price shot up due to media hype, the exact same thing happened in 2011, its good for publicity long term. Besides, the price should be about $40/coin, it is still tremendously overvalued.
That doesn't mean we won't see a pump 'n dump next week.
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:24:02
The bitcoin protocol has been established, and it can't be changed. Do you understand how mining works?
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:24:32
PROTIP: mtGOX has announced that they are going to add LTC in the next week or two, it's a sleeper that *may* take off.
