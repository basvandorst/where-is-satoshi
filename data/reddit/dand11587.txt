I don't think you can compare the two. HTTP and SMTP are good enough in a way that everyone benefits from them if they all use them. Bitcoin is the opposite. The only people who benefit from the adoption of Bitcoin are the people who have bitcoin. There will be intense pressure to start new currencies when/if a string of 1's and 0's becomes worth $32,000.

Nicely put. The only reason I can think of as for why people would choose a single (or few) digital currencies would be due to some irrational brand-loyalty, an obvious and superior security and ease-of-use, or a lack of technology to manage unlimited digital currencies.

why do these analysts think that BTC will remain the only dominant digital currency? Is it likely that another "bitcoin clone" will come along before $700k is reached and dilutes the price? Just like there is USD, EUR, YEN, etc.?
At some point I think the price of each digital currency will equal the cost of energy required to produce a coin (which is a function of how hard it is to make each digital currency and how many miners are currently in the industry)

You are arguing against no one. I never said they were solely going to bitcoin. Clearly the volume is not there to account for an entire country buying bitcoin. And I'm not sure you grasp the entirety of the topic.. When a country goes in to crisis mode, traditional forms of currency exchange, banking, and financial institutions clam up. I believe Western Union for example has stopped doing business in Argentina already. When fewer options are on the table, bitcoin becomes more enticing.

Nothing. A more historically sound proof of value, if that is worth anything.
That is the point, though. If BTC were soaring due to lack of faith in fiat currency as so many people here suggest, gold and silver would also be gaining. I'm not saying gold and silver would be experiencing 100% daily gains, but atleast some bullish movement.

There is nothing stopping the development of technology that integrates all digital currencies into a single point of management. The question in the future will not be, "do you accept bitcoin?" it will be, "Do you accept digital currency?" and all digital currencies will be completely fungible.

Haha, true, it would mostly be a sounding board for what we already know -- most people with money to spend on bitcoin currently think bitcoin is not in a bubble (or else it would have already crashed).
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:24:44
That would require a central agency to control exchange rates and defeat the entire purpose of any new currency. We should just keep what we have if that were the goal of the cryptocurrency movement.
Luckily that is not the goal. Atleast not that I have seen.
@_date: 2013-05-20 18:12:19


I see this argument a lot. What is stopping an infinite amount of bitcoin clones (same security, same technology needed to mine, zero switching costs assuming technology is there to manage multiple cryptocurrencies) from being started up? Wouldn't this mean that each cryptocurrency would tend toward an equilibrium where "resources to create/transact a coin" = "value of the coin"?

At the first sign of harder-than-alternatives profits, miners will switch to alternative cryptocurrencies. And supply and demand would dictate that there would be incentives for oversaturated markets (bitcoin) to be avoided in favor of undersaturated markets (feathercoin in your example) by having an easier time mining and speculating.
But I want to revise my original statement that the value of cryptocurrencies = their resources to make one. That doesn't tell the whole story, because it doesn't take in to account the amount of miners currently mining a currency. As less-than-perfect currencies are abandoned and leading cryptocurrency technologies are adopted and cloned ad infinitum, the prices of all cryptocurrencies will trend towards zero in the long term (as they are replaced with better versions), and hover around the price of the resources that it takes for the lowest-cost miners in the lowest competitive 'difficulty level', assuming currencies will have a difficulty like bitcoin does.
Imagine, bitcoin is priced at $100 by the market. It takes $10 to make a bitcoin or transact a bitcoin's worth of transaction fees. Miners cram in to the market, making it more difficult to produce a bitcoin until the price of generating a bitcoin equals $100. Then some miners take a risk and start a new clone currency because they want to speculate or whatever. They then create an equal currency for a far lower cost. miners leave bitcoin to get in on the speculation. As the market is now flooding with this clone currency, it begins to rival bitcoin. As there is more equivalent cryptocurrency floating around, bitcoins value drops to $80. Miners abandon bitcoin en mass because the cost to produce is now higher than the value of the coin. As miners flood out of bitcoin, and more and more cryptoclones pop up, bitcoin continues to fall and knock out miner after miner after miner until there is only a small legion of miners in each cryptocurrency and they are all being produced and transacted as cheaply as algorithmically possible. A true decentralized crytocurrency environment where the 'backing' is not a government or 'what the market values it at', but a backing of technological advancement and, like you said, a network of interchangeable miners maintaining equilbrium.

@_date: 2013-04-08 17:49:08
Maybe you misunderstood what I meant. I meant a bitcoin will always have a marginal cost (the cost to produce one more bitcoin). And no one would produce a bitcoin if the market price were lower than that. Due to the way bitcoin is self-regulating, it seems that there would be an equilibrium between the cost of producing a bitcoin and the market value of a bitcoin. This equilibrium would be directly related to the demand for bitcoins (in the long term). When there is a huge discrepancy like there is now, the cost and price will have to change in order to reach long term equilibrium. Either more miners enter and make the cost rise, or the cost of bitcoins must come down, or meet in the middle. Until then, it is a bubble.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:33:25
Its all open source and easily duplicatable. The only scarcity is computing power. And that is inflating at an exponential rate forever. What Bitcoins offer, so does every digital currency that shares its characteristics. I love digital currency and hate governments, but digital currency is tied to the cheapest miners electricity cost, and nothing more. Its economics.
@_date: 2013-05-20 21:06:37
Not everyone must be a miner. The values will be set by consumers valuing coins based on supply and demand. All cryptos will be equally secure and usable.
You are right, I think, that the value of a particular coin will be relative to its network size. That goes hand in hand with my theory that the value of a coin will be roughly equal to the cost to produce one (a bigger network means more difficulty). But consumers ultimately decide the value of the coin, and as all coins become equal in security and features, the value will always go down.
Right now bitcoin is just experiencing a bunch of uninformed speculators and hopeful dreamers.
Think of it this way: As a person with mining equipment, would you mine bitcoin1 that nets you 1btc per week, or bitcoin2 (identical in every way) that nets you 2btc per week? You'd go for the one that provides highest profit, which is directly determined by how many miners there are (which is a function of how much consumers value the coin). You'd go to the one with the least miners.

@_date: 2013-04-12 16:14:18
everything is "intrinsically worthless" if you look at it that way. cryptocurrencies strenth lie in the ability to be untraceable by governments. That means they cannot tax and rule you. Cryptocurrencies in the long term will be worth whatever the cheapest computer cycles cost. basically, the cost will be correlated to energy prices and technology advances. This is not a bad thing.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:29:25
Are you talking about amazon accepting bitcoin or something? That will not happen in a month. No major businesses will accept bitcoin until the bitcoin price stabilizes.

Technology to make it seamless for users is not impossible.


The limiting factor here is technology used to manage the different currencies. This is not impossible.
I can't see people voluntarily agreeing to only use a select few digital currencies at their own detriment. The world didn't agree to use gold solely as a currency. The world was like, "screw that, silver is just as good, lets use that too." and on and on with every resource. Since there are unlimited digital currencies and they all have equal security and ease-of-use, why would any of them maintain a higher demand?

Crowd acceptance? No. Dollars are valued because the biggest mob on earth values them. That mob doesnt accept fake dollars as a tithing.
If all digital currencies have the same security, why would someone value them any higher than the resources needed to make one? They would just mine their own. Or buy from one of the millions of miners who mine an infinite amount of equally secure and equally easy to use digital currencies.

It makes no sense to store wealth in something so volatile as bitcoins. I predict that wealth will likely not be stored in bitcoin, that is not the value proposition of bitcoin. The value proposition of bitcoin is secure and cheap transactions. I predict scenarios like this will be most common:
Individual A holds his wealth in gold/USD/whatever. Individual A instantly converts some of his wealth to BTC and trades BTC with Individual B. Individual B instantly converts the BTC in to his desired store of wealth (Yen/USD/gold/whatever).

Registering is nothing of that sort. Registering simply allows the government to know who currently possesses bullion legally. It doesn't stop counterfeits because most do not have serial numbers or anything of that nature, and they give no indication that they are going to assure the quality of the bullion. You have just made up a bunch of BS to justify the policy. 
Tax reasons makes no sense either, as the majority of trade in this country is not registered and they don't care about that. Why would they want to capture the relatively tiny amount of trade going on through bullion when they don't require registration of bigger volumes of trade like restaurants, bars, car washes, rent, and all other cash transactions?
Money laundering? Now you are really stretching. See the reason above for why they don't care about money laundering in bullion.
In all seriousness, if you see no problem with registering bullion purchases, then do you have any problem with registering purchases like bar tabs, gasoline, convenience store items, bowling shoe rentals, books, movies, and a million other transactions that are untraceable and anonymous?
