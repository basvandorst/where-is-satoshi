We do take this seriously and we can offer some one  safe secure locations (9)available Free placement  (limited).But when someone asks if we are on drugs well we will always answer lighthearted and jokingly .Because we can .Thanks and if anyone wants to see our available locations we are glad to show you what a 16y/o can get to happen when everyone in Neighborhood has known us our whole lives.We have prime locations and the support of local owners ,that had no idea what crypto was/is until We introduced them .We have spoken with local papers,Tv news,and Tourist magazines and they all say they will interview shop owners and machine owners to get the word out.So for 16 I think im on right track and im always looking for a mentor that can help us Make The Arts District a Bitcoin/crypto community.Thanks for your input and any ideas are welcome.

yes and that machine has a huge Robocoin logo and if they choose a shitty provider THEY are responsible for me and my crew not able to cash  our paychecks .If they cannot service 3 people in a town of 1.5 million then they really have no chance of serving the world in a quality,trustworthy manor plus now my coins are in their wallet ,while i hope the machine gets filled before it gets hacked or robbed by the shit vendor running the machine.Again since its Robocoins name on it we feel ultimely they need to fix it. Just my thought as i go without again because  thye convience promised has not materialized.
@_date: 2014-12-20 06:29:09
we been slowly building up 1 block at a time we have most of the arts factory,raw remedies el Sombrero cafe and alot more .But there are only 3 so far who will refuse you.but we hope to change their mind also There are also 3 store owners who will facilitate a trade if we have a vendor is not equiped yet.We have also been talking with event vendors for months and currently equiping and traing them to accept.we will be Putting list out when we have 50 ready.

Thank you for your time and knowledge.I  believe moolah to be a RIGHTOUS ,TRUSTED company that and still would reccomend them but not for cashout.They where a bit condescending ,and so i was back .But at same time I kept it on support tickets until i saw the ,im going on break message,the other OP and  with my 2 personal exp. I felt that it would be wrong not to let the community know .PLUS THERE NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM IF THEY CONDUCTED BUSINESS ON TIMELY MANNER.Both times i was slow walked they sponsored a event so it only goes to say with past market exp.if they want our money and want annonmity then they must answer tickets appropiatly ,IE Time and dates when all transfers made instead 24 hours and really 10 days.Or face heat when things seem off kilter.Thanks all my opions and like i said i hope they stay and will recommend others but i have been banned for asking for what is rightfully mine so seems kind of like its personal.

I have been doing business a long time and I understand your issues with slow payment. I also understand that nobody wants another gox or NnB.
The problem is that on reddit things that could and should be sorted in a professional way end up becoming raging dramas and witch hunts. My original comment about OP needing to be more transparent still stands. Any faceless group of individuals can demand things and spread fud. But how do we know that "cryptotruthgroup" is not just one guy with a vendetta or a competing company/exchange. We can't just go on a witch hunt because some faceless redditor for 12 hours stirs up the shit.
I have been here for 5 years and I have seen some bad things happen to innocent people because of mob mentality.
Threads where long time users (who are notable web comic authors) start getting death threats on their home phone because a couple of redditors thought he was lying about his polyamorous relationship.
The Boston Bombing detective drama, where reddit pinned it on a missing kid who turned out to actually be dead.
Cancer victems trying to raise money who all of a sudden are believed to be scammers, they start getting death threats and weird mail, then it turns out they did actually have cancer.
If you are having issues getting money back go to Citizens Advice Bureau or your local equivalent. You will get better results than here.
As a contractor sometimes I have to wait months for my pay. It sucks. My bank manager always tells me to do a business credit check on anyone I work with. It costs 5 bucks and will tell you liquidity of a company. In a couple of months Moolah's first filings should be available through companies house and everybody who cares can have a look at the data.
There is no need for a witch hunt. Sadly reddit, as much as I love it can be very mobbish.

lol,Those where questions .Plus we do have a solution .and it has nothing to do with making access more complicated .Listening to these guys at bitcoinworld and the 3 other events we have attended .Seems that all want the average person to use ,but then you complicate it.WE SUGGESTED EASILY ENACTED SOLUTION AND INSTEAD&gt;you said stop bitching .Well,im not a early adopter or a miner .so we earn our coins through public interaction with the very people your community wants to reach .We do it daily and it always comes to HOW DO I GET SOME SAFELY?WHERE CAN I SPEND IT?we pro0vide them the answers and also on proper storage.NOW ITS BITCOIN BUSINESSES AND EXCHANGES TIME TO STEP UP AND USE COMMON SENSE TRADING IS EASY WE GAVE A SIMPLE SOLUTION FREE ON THIS FORUM AND INSTEAD OF CITING IMMPOSSIBILTIES OF SUCH PLAN OR DRAWBACKS YOU SAY DONATE AND TEST BUT PROVIDE NO LINK TO WTF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.EASY IS THE ANSWER TO INTERGRATION AND ADOPTION .Dont let fear and pride stand in the way counterparty,dogeparty,omni,coloredcoins are all easy ,quick fixes for leaving millions in a hot wallet and still allow instant trackable ,irreversable,(unless by consesus)trading.so whats your plan .I have 1 and it has alot more safety built in but i still havent found 1 of you that can do something about to step up.Im young but have grown up in this community .

why,does this happen so often?if they are messing with sums like that there should be  all coins in cold trades done in tokens and cashouts manually by exchange employees. or am i just delusional. It seems to me having the regular joe or business learning how to use open bazaar type exchange wont happen.So then the growth stops and a downward spiral. Common sense seems could have prevented every hack.Plus how does that happen? insiders seem most likely as culprits ,if it was easy no bank or exchange would be safe.
Curious if there is a answer?

i love the fact that all day i have ran into statist bitcoiners .What a contradiction . our coin was intentionally designed to end the world banking org and all these fools run and defend complience like they have a badge , but in coinmarkets case they did even if it was a criminal with a badge (but all of them are) you my new friend are a breathe of fresh air thx. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 02:14:53
it was designed on that exact principle read the white paper and the 80000 words satoshi wrote . Every early adopter has become goverment schills and have made all of us vulnerable by complying with the illegal banking system this great equalizer was meant to eradicate . so hell yes and the way to accomplish this is more anon exchanges and markets . End the fed use BTC for minimum of 30% of all daily transactions. No ifrastucture where you at to do this well by me a ticket and I will build it with you . or you can just ask every place you spend money and dont use the ones that dont want our money . They need us more than we need them.

Their was also links to polticians are allowed to lie to be elected and there is also link to the fact that cia now controls news cycles with planted propaganda to the american public which is lie . then their is the case of colin Powell knowing lying to USA and congress about yellow cake that was the Justification to invade iraq and then him admitting on tv that he knew that the info was false when he presented it. but as its obvious you continue to lie to your self as you try to knock away FACt thanks enjoy all is well.

that is the meaning of states rights clause , but your state must have the balls to forgo federal funding to actualy exercise those rights .like when Montana changed speed limits to 80 in some areas they lost all federal safety/highway funds

The Six Questions
Does the government actually solve/create the problem in question? 
Do State armies/police actually defend citizens? 
Does State policing actually protect private property?
Does State welfare actually solve the problem of poverty?
Does the war on drugs actually solve the problem of addiction and crime? Do State prisons actually rehabilitate prisoners and reduce crime?
@_date: 2015-03-24 23:46:18
thx .
@_date: 2015-03-01 01:34:16
No the next false flag has already been planted in the peoples minds . Isis through use of crypto smuggle funds that finances a group of nuts . And no more crypto .,Tell me im crazy but do you remember america before the patriot act? Healthcare ,militarized police and complete control of internet sounds just like 1984 if you add all the fake wars in.
@_date: 2015-03-31 23:18:39
No it is just small enough to be mostly unnoticed on a smaller level , but as a whole all the same types of corruption are prevalent across the board from any town to any continent just people that sound different but the exact same problems. The Six Questions

Do State armies/police actually defend citizens? 
Does State policing actually protect private property?

hmm ,they speak for all of us?  at least cody will disband it and possibly open bitcoin to everyone instead of the same hackers/devs that been strangling real growth . Use in the wild by non techies,is the only real way to decentralization.
@_date: 2015-03-31 23:14:09

Then my friend i suggest 18b the arts district everything is available real estate ,auto,art,gold,food,drinks and lots more. We also envision a world of no cashing out . We live it .  it works .
@_date: 2015-03-31 23:29:57
That sir will be fact . You can bet on it as the goverment and banks will never let their cash cow die without a fight ask ,IRAQ,Afghanistan,Libya,Syria,NorthKorea and IRan all being persucuted all have 1 thing in common NO USD they ran or planned too use a gold standard only 1 is left ,they have nukes so they have ace in the whole or they would be gone also .

makes sense why risk a pre bank robbery 
@_date: 2015-03-31 23:56:07
Nope the govt. instead  subverted the principle by having the whales  come out and open these compliant companies ( They like all gov workers may feel like a sort of protection but it is actually a keep your enemies close situation. Which in turn makes it easier to subvert ,infiltrate weaken the infrastructure and destroy or take over . Every one of these coinbase,bitpay,changetip can be anon and on clearnet as we know that the same 40 or so devs have programmed every alt coin and the sites . Every DNM has been robbed due to inside job what makes you think compliance is safer? Shit Bernie was legit in all eyes until he wasnt . 
@_date: 2015-02-18 02:02:54
what ,We walk into stores and ask them thats how you get them to accept bitcoin . Gee ,they want money .If you show them how to cash to fiat easily safely and cheaply they 92.7% so far say yes. tell me your neighborhood area and i will get 1 weds to start accepting Bitcoin   You go and make it happen is how.
