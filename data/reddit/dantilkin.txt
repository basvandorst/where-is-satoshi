Not what they mean. [From the IRS:](


Unless your buying a soda to make a profit (e.g. by reselling it), it doesn't qualify.

I'd be rather surprised if other nations (that weren't going for tax haven status) didn't try to tax bitcoin gains similarly.

a specific rehabilitation plan was rejected by the court, not the idea of rehabilitation in general.

Since you refer to the $600 threshold, I assume that you're referring to Q-12 and Q-13. These questions refer to "information reporting" on the 1099-MISC form. 
There's no threshold for gains or losses, which are addressed by Q-6 and Q-7. Assuming you held the bitcoin as a capital asset, when you dispose of it, you must report the gain or loss on schedule D. A-7 references  [Publication 544]( which states: "  If you have any recognized gain because you received money or unlike property, report it on Form 8949, Schedule D (Form 1040) or Form 4797, as applicable."

from A-5:


is listed on an exchange and the exchange rate is established by market supply and 
demand, the fair market value of the virtual currency is determined by converting the virtual currency into U.S. dollars (or into another real currency which in turn can be converted into U.S. dollars) at the exchange rate, **in a reasonable manner that is consistently applied.** 
Using the last Mt. Gox price now would probably not be considered *reasonable*. Any of the others probably would be, but you wouldn't be allowed to switch to use the lowest at the particular time.

Only if it was made "in the course of a trade or business", though.
And that's not $600 of income, it's $600 of payment.

Schedule D, for reporting capital gains (assuming this was not done as part of a trade or business)

When you say "I had 1btc at $900", you do mean you bought it at $900, right? As opposed to buying lower, then holding it when it was at $900.

Interesting, I somehow missed that when it first came out. I agree that Denmark isn't generally a tax haven.

This is just referring to whether you need to file a 1099-MISC.

I don't think that applies:
From [26 USC 1091(a)](


I see no indication that bitcoin should be treated as such (and if it was, you would think they would have said so).

The lowered investment should be starting before the halvening as well, since it affects the profit calculations for any equipment which is expected to still be in service at that point.

It didn't say either. I know the number it said for me was the number of seals chips, I certainly didn't have that much bitcoin on the site. :)
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:22:45
1BTC = 1000 seal chips. If you filled it out on the website, and it said "Your cashout of .14 to &lt;address&gt; has been received", this means .14 seal chips, or .00014 BTC.
Are you sure you actually had .14 btc = 140 seal chips on the site?
