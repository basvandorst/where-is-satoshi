Nice HOI4 reference.

Do you mean you didn't get paid out some of the LTC on some of the pools?
@_date: 2018-05-21 01:33:55
It constantly switches and payouts are usually at a certain time, so that makes sense.
@_date: 2018-05-21 01:16:56
On Bitcoin it is, but on other cryptos it is the top. Most algorithms block ASICs and only allow GPU and CPU miners. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 01:11:41
If you really want to mine, start mining some altcoins. ASICs are way to expensive and you don't get much in return. Of course, it is really hard to get $20 a day without some serious hash power, but you get a much greater ROI with GPU mining. Ask me any questions, I am willing to answer them.

That is very interesting to me. Across all pools you should get the same return no matter what, it is just the amount of times it happens. It probably switches depending on the highest hash rate or something. Is it only switching between Litecoin pools or is it switching to a different coin that is also on the scrypt algorithm?

Please explain some more, I might be able to tell you but I'm not really sure what you're talking about.
@_date: 2018-05-21 01:18:21
Edit: Will probably be more expensive when difficulty goes up.

Why has there been 49 minutes since the last block, I thought the block time was 10 minutes.
@_date: 2018-06-15 23:40:16
7 weeks? You mean 8 months? And Russian shill, I have no idea where you are coming from dude. To implement https takes more time and more coding, unless you are logging in on the website there is no point in adding it.
Edit: Just saw my flair says Redditor for 7 weeks. It isn't, on my profile it says 8 months 20 days, not sure why it says that...
@_date: 2018-06-16 01:21:16
Yeah, I've been subbed for a while. You don't have a flair though which is interesting, are you subbed to r/bitcoin? Genuinely interested.

Minimum payout is 0.01 but I've only made 0.0000000000001 ������������

Bitcoin fees are great at the moment, I love it. Again, volume of Bitcoin has fallen about 86% since January. All I'm saying is that Bitcoin has gone through some very high fees throughout this year and that could possibly happen again.
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:20:03
This is bad, is there anything we can do to combat this?
@_date: 2018-06-24 22:25:59
I specified that the fees were really low right now. It's the attackers and the big pump that affected it. Hopefully we don't have the super high fees when the next pump comes around.
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:34:05
Large fees when the mempool is under stress and a lot of load. I understand it is only 1 SAT/B right now, that is because we're in a cool down phase right now. Hopefully the adoption of SegWit will fix it for the next big pump.
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:19:22
It's a joke dude, I know I need an ASIC to mine.
@_date: 2019-08-17 01:57:26
Try asking r/bitcoinmining. Most of the people here don't mine, you'll (hopefully) get answers over there.

ok let me mine with my gtx 1070. y havent i got ani bitcion yet????

Strange. Well, I don't know when and how I got my flair. Been subbed and commenting for a while. I'm going to see if there is a way to change it.

Satire - the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.
In this case I'm using it on the people who have no idea how to mine or how mining even works. You don't find it funny, some people do. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 22:41:16
And why would that be helpful? You don't log in or anything.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:57:32
That’s amazing! (BTW Kurdistan should be a sovereign country)
@_date: 2019-09-19 10:57:58
Correct. Blocks will mine slower and after the difficulty is retargeted, everything would go back to normal.
