Why all the down votes?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:34:15
Strange thing they raised dollars instead of Bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-08-17 21:16:40
Anyway, I don’t see why we have this discussion. I’m just saying that the suggested method might not give me all the benefits that people say that it should.
@_date: 2019-08-17 21:06:50
Yes, I know. Did I ever imply that these were examples of reuse? :)
@_date: 2019-08-24 19:24:25
Well, that depends on how you use the word. But okay: Convert then to a human readable format.
@_date: 2019-08-25 08:03:17
I thought signed transactions always were in HEX format or something. Can you give an example of a program that spits out signed transactions in JSON format. That would of course be convenient.
@_date: 2019-08-24 21:18:32
Why would I need blockchain data in order to see what my signed (not broadcasted) transaction actually will do once broadcasted?
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:00:47
Yeah, I’ve never figured out how to install the Bitcoin-cli though :P
@_date: 2019-08-17 22:59:40
Exactly! Well, now I'm off to investigate Monero :P
@_date: 2019-08-17 17:50:00
I actually read that whole article before posting here. Could you clarify what I’ve got wrong?
@_date: 2019-08-25 08:05:24
Yes, I agree. I’m using the word someone without knowledge of cryptography would.
@_date: 2019-08-28 23:25:33
Oh yeah, this sounds familiar. My endgame here is really to figure out how I can use Bitcoin Core with a Coldcard, where the BIP32 has been generated on the device. Maybe I should stop beating around the bush and just ask that question in a new post somewhere :P
@_date: 2019-08-19 08:36:25
Great link! Thanks! I read the whole thing and now I feel a lot more informed.
@_date: 2019-08-26 00:56:08
So if I build a wallet that replaces the hash with a copy of the private key, it really doesn’t since “signed bitcoin transaction data does not leak any part of private key used to sign it. Period.” 
I realize that leaking the private key wouldn’t be in line with what is supposed to happen in a benevolent program, but I’m talking about a case where bad actors are running the show.
@_date: 2019-08-24 20:58:18
Scroll bar broken. Good one :) But where in this process is signed.txt transformed into a human readable format which is what I asked for? Here, the only thing you’re doing with signed.txt is to broadcast it. Read my original question again.
@_date: 2019-08-28 22:52:41
Nice. It kinda is. Being able to import a public key to create a watch only wallet which then could be used together with a hardware wallet would be even better. But thanks!
@_date: 2019-08-17 18:47:11
Nice! Has this proposal been implemented in any wallets? (I guess not since I haven’t heard about it.)
@_date: 2019-08-19 09:20:56


Wouldn't I notice when pasting the address, or double-checking it, that they were different (hence making this scenario fall under me making a misstake, something that was assumed that I can not do)? Could you please elaborate?  


In my example, how would an attacker get hold of my seed? The seed is only kept on my offline computer which only can transmit information via displaying it on the screen. Would he stand behind me, snapping a photo and then run? :)
@_date: 2019-08-17 20:22:53
I’ve never said that there isn’t a connection between privacy and attack vectors. I’m just exploring one of these aspects right now (let’s say that I only care about staying anonymous but don’t care if someone steals my BTC).
Also, I *don’t* have to consider the privacy of those with I may interact with (maybe I’m a psychopath).
@_date: 2019-08-19 09:08:28
So, let me get this straight. Is the signature self-contained in that you only broadcast the signature to the network? Otherwise, wouldn't the online wallet somehow notice that the signature is for different outputs than what it expected?
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:32:17
Sorry :P
@_date: 2019-08-26 00:58:55
Well, I already know Python and this here is part of me learning Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2019-08-17 18:55:38
I’ve never said that I want to reuse my addresses. I’ve said that even if one makes sure not to reuse addresses, it seems like you still can (and probably will) be exposed to the privacy concerns that separate addresses are meant to avoid. That is, once I send my whole balance somewhere, all my separated addresses will be tied together and from a privacy standpoint, I could just as well had been using a single address from the start (other than you maybe can get away with saying that you don’t control the address you sent everything to).
Also, I don’t care about attack vectors right now. My question just concerns privacy issues.
@_date: 2019-08-24 14:41:34
Thanks! This was exactly what I sought after. Now I just need to find some tutorial that untangle all the different programs and concepts from each other (Bitcoin core GUI, Bitcoind, Bitcoin-cli, rpc, etc). Hopefully I can figure it out.
@_date: 2019-08-24 19:27:31
Yes, I know that you can import an unsigned transaction and then sign it in Electrum. But can you check what the signed transaction actually is going to do? That is, if I just send you a signed transaction, how would you in Electrum, without broadcasting the transaction, be able to tell were it would go?
@_date: 2019-08-19 09:28:11
And this is information that anyone could verify by looking at the signed transaction, right? So wouldn't the online wallet be able to refute the signed transaction coming from the compromised offline wallet before broadcasting it?
@_date: 2019-08-25 08:06:51
Using the built in command line?
@_date: 2019-08-20 10:21:20
So why did you bring up the example? I'm confused. I stated in the main post that we should assume that I can't make any mistakes.
@_date: 2019-08-28 23:39:23
Yeah, I’ve heard that episode myself. I get the process once everything is set up. It’s the setup part I don’t know how to do though.
@_date: 2019-08-27 00:03:59
Now we’re asking the right questions!
@_date: 2019-08-26 09:20:11
They can't just sweep the private keys if you're signing transactions in an offline wallet. Then they would have to trick you into embed your private keys into a raw signed transaction that you then will put on your online computer. Sure, the transaction will be refused by the network (unless the attacker transforms the transaction into a valid one again using the private key it now got), but at the same time you notice this, the attacker will already have either ran of with the key or just saved it somewhere in order to make a grandiose exit scam at some point, hoping that not all users have spent their change by then.
@_date: 2019-08-19 09:48:40


To clarify: What I meant is that the code I'm running on my offline wallet has been compromised at some point in time and that I since then have registered my seed words in it. Whatever it takes to make this example be about transaction signing rather than just stealing someone's seed words.


This would fall under me making a misstake though, something that I'm incapable of doing in this example. That is, I would see the true address on my offline wallet and I would be able to confirm that it doesn't match the address stated on the online wallet, right?
@_date: 2019-08-24 19:29:42
From reading the manual ( this command only seems to transform an UNsigned message.
@_date: 2019-08-26 14:16:04
A hardware wallet could perform the same scam. Unless you believe me, do you want to buy my DIY hardware wallet? I promise that I won’t have programmed it in a malicious way.
@_date: 2019-08-17 19:18:20
You should do a pull request on Github to better define the concept. I understood what they meant but probably only because I was sent there from this thread.
@_date: 2019-08-19 09:38:03
Giving my computer to an attacker, saying: "Here, do whatever you want with my computer and return it to me when you're done."
@_date: 2019-08-17 21:29:17
So, to just to get things straight. If I have one BTC divided up into 100 different addresses, I won’t be able to buy that 1 BTC Lambo from a merchant without revealing that I owned all those  hundred addresses?
@_date: 2019-08-25 23:43:37


You don't say?


Okay, thanks for the random security advice.
You do realize my question is theoretical rather than me asking for advice which hardware wallet to buy?
@_date: 2019-09-23 12:08:40
But couldn't my private keys be hidden in the transaction even if the addresses checks out? See: [
