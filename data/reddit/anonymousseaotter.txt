I agree, but I am not sure how this would be possible. If Bitcoin becomes a reference, regulations will be implemented and when it comes to finance, regulations means KYC. Companies will have to request those information if they want to be able to offer their services (I mean the Coinbase of the world, etc.). 
I also believe that the key of Bitcoin, the interesting aspect of it (at least in my opinion) is the decentralized aspect of it, not the non-kyc one. As long as we keep the system decentralized and not controlled by one authority, bitcoin will have value.

That is interesting but I am not sure exactly what you have in mind.
Do you mean a messaging app through a blockchain infrastructure ? If so, there's already a few players in that field (Dust come to mind).

The Cash App is definitely available in the UK but can't do bitcoin yet.

I agree! The way I see it, you need to buy an amount you are comfortable completely losing in 2 weeks. 
I agree with everyone in this Reddit that on the long run, you should be fine, but not everybody can afford to wait the long run with their entire savings playing yoyo. 
To sum up, put the amount you are ready to lose and you should be fine.

Yes, I think a lot of people are gonna sell around 20k, because they don't want to be left behind like last time. So 20k is gonna be a hard one to cross.

Square seems to be pro bitcoin. You can buy it with the Cash App and Jack Dorsey is a huge fan of BTC.
