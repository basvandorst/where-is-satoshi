Yeah but still currently most of those scenarios aren't worth the risk due to volatility, of course no harm in implementing this for future use.

Tails is an OS that has everything you need for quick private Internet access, nothing is stored after shutdown. It comes with tools such as PGP so you can have secure private communication and you can boot it off of a USB on about any pc. Edward Snowden used it to communicate with journalists and upload the NSA files. In general people use it in situations where they can't trust their pc security and their network security. All traffic is routed through Tor (the onion router). 
Satoshi Nakamoto used Tor for all his Internet communications and when mining the first blocks. He probably would have used tail (don't know if it was available back then). 
Another group of people that use tails are people involved in the darknet since it gives them the tools they need to do their shit (like journalists), but that isn't a reason to not donate to the Tails team of course.
Basically you use Tails if you want to stay secure 
I never used Tails myself but I'll check it out as I find this stuff pretty interesting.

Pm me, I'll set up a full website and host it for free if you can provide the images and text, you'd only need to pay for the domain name. No catch, am currently setting up my webdesign company and need to expand my portfolio. I'll host it for a full year.

What kind of sites were they? 
@_date: 2014-03-20 09:56:21
It's the bitcoin Boulevard website, they have a page for every participant, Ppatabtky) apparently the guy didn't press enter after entering the amount

But then again this is Gox.

I see it like this: bit represents the programmable part of it and coin the currency, so it basically says 'new digital money' as opposed to 'old physical money'

Sorry I misread, thought it was 1 album. Great deal then! :)

You use a USB live stick instead of a cd. You just run the os from the stick without installing. You don't need a hard disk for this.

Yeah but the fact that they accept bitcoin has nothing to do with this behaviour. And yes they're probably dropshipping.

An atm camera won't be able to focus so close to the lense and I assume you have to verify the address scanned

No, it's every possible private key, you can look up your own since it's sorted alphabetically 
@_date: 2014-08-21 19:04:49
This isn't about permanent loss of funds so it's irrelevant. It's about customer information, something finances have nothing to do with, bitcoin doesn't make their database more secure. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 13:21:56
Yeah well all your private keys are there, BUT since you can't sort it by address it's useless;) 
@_date: 2014-03-25 13:15:53
Isn't it ironic? 
@_date: 2014-03-22 10:14:33
Bitcoin needs adoption to be successful, if stores can't accept bitcoin anymore bitcoin becomes less useful and less valuable.

What about 10-minute email?

What about encrypting the data through several other nodes, the receiver then reports the md5 or whatever which proves that they downloaded that specific file. 
I'm obviously no expert, is something like this feasible? So all data would be unique  even if it's the same file. Or some other system of tagging the files, the receiver reports to the nodes which then verify.
@_date: 2014-01-17 02:42:50
But what if encryption or tagging or whatever doesn't happen at node A but somewhere in between? The receiver then reports back to the 'neutral'  node. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:19:23
That's why you check the send address

No you have to do some mouse over shit over your bitcoin balance and click the withdraw button

That doesn't matter because no one knew that, also we still don't know when and even if the coins got lost

Don't HD wallets use multiple inputs to fund transactions as well? If you have 1 btc in address a and 2 btc in address b, and you want to spend 3 btc, someone can see that you own both those addresses(and cab reasonably guess which of the 2 receiving addresses is the change address).
