This whole scenario makes me question why the bitcoin community sees "Wall Street" as such an evil entity - as if decentralized bitcoin operates much better.
Is this scenario, in addition to the many, many scams and thefts conducted by exchanges previously, the 'bank' itself is refusing access to accounts and possibly outright stealing money? All of this while still making income on trades!?
Bitcoin just seems like a severely flawed system if exchanges can freely get away with this behavior. And they are quite freely getting away. We shouldn't have to trust that exchanges are good to us - the bitcoin system itself should have safeguards in place.
Just read the Bitcoin description here to the right... it's actually almost funny:
********Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks.********
So the wild volatility in BTC is somehow better than inflation and we traded corrupt banks for corrupt exchanges. :(

Would any business completely shut down all aspects of its daily functioning outside of an ongoing issue? Of course not! 
An office move is NOT some enormous event, people...

I believe there's a difference between trading currencies and buying goods though... you have customs and transport to worry about so you can't compare prices alone. With currency you have transaction fees but they are generally the same across the board. 
Anyhoo, I think my use of 'arbitrage' was correct... you can learn more here.

Why are you glossing over the danger applied to gathering the wallets, given the danger is to the customers' coins!?

lol nice, just below Manchin claiming BTC is enabling illegal activity - someone's circumventing trade sanctions with it.

Interesting... that makes sense I guess. thanks :)

finally a reverse of the trend in price, even if not a huge one...  the big drops earlier today were a bit scary. Feeling warm and fuzzy again ;)

if we say that theoretically gox DOES allow withdrawals again...  won't that pull down the other exchanges?  i.e. right now people are buying gox BTC at very low rates. If gox re-opens, it will be quite lucrative for their customers to take their BTC out immediately and go sell on other exchanges at the higher rates.  This rush would thereby pull down those other prices until the lower Gox price and higher other prices meet somewhere in the middle?

very good question; if mtgox actually disappears with everyone's coins at this point, I'd say the BTC Foundation is enormously suspect and untrustworthy. Lack of action on their part at this point - I would say - indicates their acceptance that mtgox is doing the right thing... which should be as a result of evidence given by mtgox.

I'm somewhat new to bitcoin - but isnt it a core economic flaw here (arbitrage if I remember econ 101 correctly) that when all the freezes are gone... I can buy a BTC on Gox, transfer it to Bitstamp, and sell it immediately at a much higher price? How can the value of the same commodity be so different in equally accessible marketplaces? :-/

ok, thanks :)

Wow, so many posts tearing this card apart. You will never get your real debit cards or other signs of stability with bitcoin without these pioneers leading the way in the early days, people. Show your support or bitcoin stays playmoney with geeks forever.

Media articles claimed BTC would follow this chart at the top of the first peak a while back...  and it didn't.

I was just asking. Tone it down there cowboy.

Omg downvote the comment poster (tharlam) above pls for posting completely misleading out-of-context info  xD 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:41:29
He already posted a comment above saying it 's no small part of his total investment. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:49:52
Its already been quoted and linked here in several places...

I don't really think so... but to each his own.
