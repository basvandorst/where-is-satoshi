The business was not misrepresented in any way.
You are seriously dwelling on this?

Good idea, thanks!   They may not be as huge as they look

I used to think it was mildly funny until I realized that some members actually take themselves seriously and have a profound hatred of all things bitcoin that doesn't even rule out doxxing, threats, impersonations and vote brigading.

This is the size he ordered

Okay -- what is your "legitimate criticism"?
This is why I said I don't want to get into the details -- you are a troll and your buddies who have been perpetually attacking this have no other purpose.  
When my son posted people accused him of not writing it -- when I posted people accused me of using his image --- when I provided details about his agreement he made for his financing people criticized that I would provide a contract to a child---  when I don't give details....more criticism.
One person complained that he is "too young to drink coffee"
There is literally nothing that you won't find fault with.

It's fixed now we think!

Glad you like it!

Thanks for making some effort to explain, although I strongly disagree.   The copy and photos were his idea and never in my wildest thoughts did it occur to me to tell him "wait son, hide your identity because people will hate that you are a kid and we will be attacked, criticized, called names and reported as spam"

It's working now!

We took the pictures off because of the amazing and stunning number of troll attacks.   We received hate mail, a hack attempt, a fake food delivery attempt, a fake changetip and the other account was reported as "spam" by a bot engine.
I assure you it is completely his business and his idea and his money.
@_date: 2014-09-22 15:42:59
It's fixed now!

These are the same deranged jerks who attacked my 7 year old son for a post about his bitcoin store.
He worked over a month to come up with a plan and we made every aspect of running a business, setting up a website and getting inventory into a lesson.
Buttcoin trolls first claimed it was really not a child running the store or posting. Then they claimed that it was bad parenting to teach a child about bitcoin. Then they claimed that it was really the parents creating an elaborate plot to use the child to steal his money (total profit is about $5 per item).
They did a coordinated irc vote brigade attack, got our account banned from Reddit, crank called us and had food delivered to our address.
Their hatred of all things bitcoin goes way beyond normal or sane behavior. Many prominent people in the space have received death threats simply and only because they support bitcoin. We can guess what sub the people making the threats hang out for fun and "laughs".
Stay classy Buttcoin.

BitMugs will be there with some Bitcoin mugs!  :)

Okay -- so your justification for trolling is over the terms of whether a loan (to a 7 year old) is considered his property or the property of the one giving the loan?
Okay --- whatever gives you enjoyment on Reddit.

Okay so anyone can open a business and use their image, talk about themselves etc.   But if they are a kid they deserve to be harassed, attacked and people should "ignore all such sites".
So your theory is that it was a plot by parents to steal the money from the child and pocket the whopping $300 or so he could make if he sells every mug over the next several months?
You people really have such a fundamental lack of understanding of math that you think we did this for the money?   Have you crunched the numbers on how many mugs we'd have to sell?   It's unthinkable that maybe, just maybe we are telling the truth?

That may be an inadvertent side effect but most of that sub exists simply to be negative
@_date: 2014-09-22 18:41:47
Look -- we spent about a month working on helping him create a business after he requested that help.  We gave him lessons on everything from web design to writing to accounting for profits to how to make a plan and present it and gave a loan based on that.
Frankly I really baffled and stunned by the trolling.  What is your issue with this?   
@_date: 2014-10-17 11:14:37
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-09-22 18:31:55
I don't want to get into the details based on yesterday's trolling.  If you have genuine intentions I apologize and hope you will understand.   
We taught him how to make a plan and gave him a loan.
