yeah I don't think they were able to get all of this guys bit coins. They have pretty high priced lawyers which Im sure his parents are paying of through his bit coin wealth. I think they have to do these type of stunts in order to show face that thats not the case.

pressed pills and MDMA is a completely different high as well. i like both for different reasons. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 07:28:59
i am new to bit coin what does this mean essentially?
@_date: 2014-03-22 21:12:25
yeah 90% of what they call molly on the street has 0 MDMA.
@_date: 2014-02-09 07:54:33
so was the price drop completely unrelated?

serious question, is overstock.com a good place to buy stuff? Ive browsed a few times and it didn't seem like it offered ridiculously lower prices or anything like that.

it depends the ones from the netherlands are pretty legit but in order to get them you have to order them from the dark net 
@_date: 2015-05-31 21:22:24
can you explain to me what that means?
@_date: 2015-05-31 20:54:54
yeah i feel like people are so paranoid after watching movies and shit. Things arent as blatently corrupt as you think and the vast majority of people in the legal justice system and police force are on the right side of the law, and they have to be because there are systems of checks and balances. To assume it was planned all along to falsly charge him with murder means there would be so many people on so many different levels of the system involved in a major consipiracy it just doesnt make sense.  It would be impossible to pull off without leaks.

@_date: 2013-11-08 21:00:23
new to this, any reason why bit coin is gain popularity in china?
@_date: 2013-11-22 10:44:59
its the volatility of bit coin which makes me weary. that plus the rush of uninformed people trying to get on the train.
