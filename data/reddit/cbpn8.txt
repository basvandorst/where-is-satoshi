This is no brekthrough, just proof of concept.
Post again when you can settle your mortgage via crypto/LN.

You can also buy ETFs, major ones being GBTC and COINXBT.

And probably the poster wouldn't be using it himself either.
I'd say it's partly because of the bear market, and partly because of the high fees these ATMs charge.
And this is not adoption, but just another middleman trying to get a piece of the action.

You can talk about scaling but "same perf as just one computer"? That's a single point of failure. You have to trust that computer A LOT.

Trade wars accelerate inflation, i.e. the debasement of fiat.

We have moved past the stage of paying for coffee using bitcoin, since its blockchain is a perpetual ledger and hence a scarce resource which should not be wasted in recording day to day transactions.  Just a natural consequence of general adoption and fee economics. For your daily coffee, I'd say stay tuned for the maturity of layer two.

It's not about the fees, but rather the capacity.
How many transactions do you think bitcoin to handle? The current limit is about 7tps. Assuming a very modest rate of 5 transactions per person per day, there is only enough capacity for the use of 120k pure crypto users. Compared to the hundreds of millions of credit cards out there, the current incarnation of bitcoin can only be the money of the few.

Send me fiat and I can sell you for a much cheaper fee��

An ETF listed on one of the major exchanges will allow anyone with brokerage accounts to buy. On the other hand crypto rollout at individual exchanges does not provide such universal access. In fact, traders can already buy the Swedish bitcoin ETF Bitcoin Tracker One at Interactive Brokers.

He's talking about a centralised ledger in the disguise of a blockchain. Anything decentralised is not Russian.

Time will tell but we all wish his decision turns out to be the right one, don't we?

No he didn't sell.
What he did was buy and hold and all in.
In trading Vs holding he chose holding.
In fiat Vs crypto he chose crypto.
If crypto goes mainstream both of these would turn out to be good decisions.

Certainly extreme, especially the family arrangement.
The investment decision could be all right though.
Hold a small percentage of crypto, and your assets are at risk of devaluation against crypto. Hold too much crypto, and you risk forced liquidation along the way.
