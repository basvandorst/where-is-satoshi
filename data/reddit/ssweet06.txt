i got banned from all my high school computers for getting into the teachers account and bringing him over to show him how i did it so he could get it fixed in case someone that wanted to change peoples grades did it.  he freaked out and brought me to the principals office and they decided to ban me from the computers.

the more these services get hacked, the more these site owners will understand how serious to take security and the better the security will get.  Until we get something bank esque for bitcoin.  Insured from theft, easy mode security for morons that can't even remember their own damn user names to their various services they use, bitcoin won't go mainstream for the general public.  I fully believe that.  
@_date: 2014-02-15 23:27:26
I think you are correct.  Thats where i believe our services on top of bitcoin come into play.  In my modest opinion, bitcoin will need to be regulated before it can hit the same type of services and feature/security set of banks and credit cards.  Wish I could see the future.

So who appoints a centralized PR team for a decentralized system?  At what point does it become centralized?  I understand your frustration with false information.

I worked at godaddy.  We couldn't process payments from people in certain regions, mostly africa and some middle eastern places and south american areas.  Basically if the fraud rate was high enough, we'd basically decline to even DO business with them unless they mailed us a check.  It would then have to clear, then we'd load basically godaddy dollars (good as gold is the program name) and they could use that to pay for whatever.  But we'd flat decline certain people, based on their geographic location.  Bitcoin solves both aspects of this problem.  The aspect of fraud, completely solved.  The aspect of virtual businesses denying people, based on where they live is solved with privacy of Bitcoin.  Not to mention an entire dept of 30-40 people in that fraud department, that would save a lot of money to be able to put these people in different departments with their salary.
@_date: 2014-07-21 23:05:37
No, clearly YOU don't get it.  Stripe can't accept your payments if the banks they use to process it deny THEM.  You said it yourself, their banking partners.  So you are mad at stripe because they are trying to make an archaic system better but the tyrants that run it denied them?  Of fucking course those assholes "don't believe in mining".  I wouldn't believe in shit that could potentially threaten my well being either.  Unfortunately for them, it exists wether they believe in it or not.

He is paying for it.  His business is going under and now he's nervous about whos around and watching his back I'm sure.  He didn't steal from the whole bitcoin community.  He stole from the morons that kept their coins on an exchange after witnessing this happen on multiple occasions.  
Even if he was to get shot in the head, what does that do for you?  Do you get your coins back?  I do this thing called thinking about your actions and what it leads to.  It leads to nothing.  People are pissed, understandable, they screwed up and it fucked them real hard.  It's a tough lesson I'm sure, but what does knowing the intricate details of how the rapist raped your wife help you in the long run?  Your wife still got raped, your coins are still gone.  There's nothing that gets them back unless the owner of the wallet they are in now decided to give them back.

I don't think you understand profBS.  He said it needs to be more usable for the common user, which I agree with.  Then you said, "YEA MAN!! MARKETING!!!" .....
marketing doesn't make it easier for the common person, you didn't even read his post.  marketing makes it so the common person KNOWS about it.  The common person isn't going to go to coinbase, set up their wallet, download the bitcoin wallet software, sync for days because they have piss poor internet and withdrawl the bitcoins off coinbase and secure their wallet.dat file.  THATS what we are talking about when we say make it more accessible.  
What bitcoin needs to be successful is the same set of tools and companies building services OVERTOP the bitcoin protocol, like fiat does.  It has nothing to do with pr, it has nothing to do with marketing.  
Anyone clamouring for PR at this point is pissed the value dropped and is grasping at straws over things they don't understand.
@_date: 2014-07-02 07:32:05
Well.  I worked at Discover Card, which is a credit card network.  And how that worked is they (the merchant) would get a terminal from us.  We could then process exchanges of value between one customers account to another.  We would then give the merchant that value in fiat.  So yes, Discover Card accepts their network and pay people who use their network in fiat.  Bitpay accepts bitcoin network payments and pay people who use their "network" in fiat.  The difference is the bitcoin network is open source and free while Discover Card was closed and not free to use while also taking days to get your fiat. Explain to me how thats a silly analogy?

@_date: 2014-11-12 19:28:59
My only sticking point with this type of arguement is now bitcoin requires you to have an internet connection and a device capable of sending and receiving bitcoin.  how would those people that dont have access to a bank meet these requirements?  Do they mail their internet provider cash to pay for internet??  Not to mention if they want to spend those bitcoins, locally and in person with a merchant, now the requirements are upgraded.  Now they more than likely need a smart phone.  I think it will  be a long long long time before bitcoin is ubiquitous 
@_date: 2014-02-15 19:52:43
Your argument "i know PR gets abused by anyone with a PR dept but bitcoin needs one that works as intended!"
That's like putting a steak on the ground and getting mad at a dog for eating it.  The ENTIRE PURPOSE of PR is to provide DAMAGE CONTROL for poor situations and show them in the best light possible!  The very NATURE of it is manipulation.  PR is a form of content manipulation.  That is not what bitcoin needs.  
@_date: 2014-02-15 20:29:45
The problem is that bitcoin is not an organization or a unit or a single entity.  Its a network.  We can't appoint someone to be the end all be all voice of reason over a network.  It completely defeats the point.  we NEED others to challenge each other.  When something is the end all be all over a subject, you get rid of people challenging each other with facts and reason and slowly, everyone becomes less and less informed.  It's how things like religion happen.

but the thing is, WE can say those things.  We don't need some centralized, prone to being corrupt and working in their own self interest, group to do this for us.  I guess this just boils down to my inherent dis-trust of people in general.  I think we've both presented our arguements and they both pose valid points.  We'll just have to agree to disagree.   Personally, I think your point leans to heavily on trusting people, which is what I always try to avoid.

You didn't put money into TCP/IP like you do with bitcoin, so while I agree bitcoin is a protocol, its not quite the same comparison as there weren't people that had much to lose with TCP/IP like there is with bitcoin.  
People getting their wallets stolen and bitcoins stolen from exchanges have nothing to do with what I'm talking about.  Thats those peoples own damn fault for being uneducated about what they were doing before doing it.  Hard lesson I'm sure but lesson none the less.  
I'm glad I'm talking to people that have an idea of whats going on.  You're correct.  The companies that build services on top of bitcoin, THOSE people would do well to have a PR dept.  I'll enjoy the finger pointing from those companies that get hacked and jacked for all the dumb users that keep their bitcoins on centralized websites and contribute to having huge bounty for hacking said websites.

I'm not hating.  We are on the same team.  Based on your reply it seems you think coinbase blogging about a new feature and MARKETING that feature, thats PR.  PR is not a catalyst for growth, MARKETING is.  To be clear, marketing != PR.  PR is content manipulation in order to make sure the people you are catering to, in bitcoins case everyone, think exactly how you want them to think about a certain situation, problem, event.  
the company I work for has mandated that any reporter asking for quote "your own personal opinion" on a situation that happens at my company, we are NOT ALLOWED to tell them "our own opinion".  We have to tell them to email pr and they can ask that question to our PR department.  Our marketing team tells everyone how awesome we are and why you need what we provide.  There is a clear difference between the two.  its CONTENT MANIPULATION.  bitcoin doesn't need it.  what bitcoin needs is not marketing but infrastructure and services built on it.  Marketing will come with word of mouth, in my opinion.

banks aren't the analogy for protocol.  Banks are synonymous with services like coinbase who leverage a protocol or system, like fiat to provide services revolving around it.  The analogy for the bitcoin protocol is fiat.  There's tons of services that leverage fiat and provide services surrounding it which make it what it is, like insurance from theft at the central location.  There's so much mis-information around this sub with clueless people, we really need to make an effort to correct them because the people clamouring for PR are half the reason bitcoin would need any source of authority correcting false information in the first place!

It needs to be easier.  While it might be fine now because we are all at some level computer geeks (typically).  Current implementation is NOT okay for the masses.  Credit cards offer multiple benefits over bitcoin to protect yourself.  For example chargebacks, rewards and protection from theft.  I envision having that choice in the future with bitcoin.  
It needs to be idiot proof.  We need instant "authorization" type things.  Where you can spend your coin at mcdonalds and it'll ping them back and go instead of these delays in transaction processing.  It really irks me when people say its instant, its not, but we can "faux-instant" it by creating a trust based system for the smaller transactions kind of like authorizations work for the credit/debit system.
Software needs to evolve.  Coinbase does a great job IMO software wise.  Things like mining need to be easier too, less important than the other topics i touched on.  All the other things like securewallets and services will come, these things need to happen first tho.

@_date: 2013-12-11 01:39:14
its not a scam.  they cancelled it because they felt there was a possibility of fraud.  this is new pioneered territory they are treading, they are protecting themselves.  they have no idea what future prices will be any more than you do and if you think they are betting their customers money on that you are completely delusional.  If they REALLY wanted to make money they'd invest their own $ into it and do something to shake up confidence of the community as they are a pretty big playing in the bitcoin world at this point.  
TLDR: coinbase "high risk scam" is total bullshit, coinbase is legit.

When I go out with a buddy we can pay each other instantly with BTC.  It works great for small stupid going out with buddies type things.  I hate having to put 2 people in line for some small stupid 10$ food or whatever.  BTC fixes that nicely.

To clarify, I don't think its "hard" i just think its kind of a hassle and not really worth it.  However, the replys are changing my views on it based on the actual value it can provide in some situations.

I don't know, I could find out!

I didn't think I'd get such support for this bombing!!!

the idea is that it will drive the price of their bitcoins so high once they start accepting it they won't actually have to follow thru and they'll get a ton from the bitcoins going up.

Wait I don't understand the hate?  Isn't this sub to talk about bitcoins?  Assuming that, wouldn't most be here because they are interested and more than likely HAVE bitcoins?!  Of course I want my bitcoins to increase in value.  If I didn't, I wouldn't have bought them!  
Second, how the hell is this a scam?  Bitcoin may not be easier for retail store purchase, yet, but that has to start SOMEHOW.  They literally will get people that had no intentions of buying with them to buy things with them.  That will MORE than make up any infrastructure costs they'll incur.  Hell, depending on their back-end, it could cost them close to nothing to incorporate into their website.  
Not only do I want bitcoin to raise in value, but I want to live in a world where I can say hey, friend, whats your ID so I can send you some cash for blah blah blah.  As it stands now, I have to offer to buy them something with my credit card, assuming they want need something.  Barring that, I have to go to an atm, get cash, deliver it to them, probably pay a fee because I can't be bothered to go to the correct fucking atm in order to manipulate MY money.  
Wait, lets say I want to buy a 2 thousand dollar TV on newegg.com.  Surprise!  Wells fargo won't let me use my debit card because they only deem me fit to spend 900$ (which i had to bitch to a supervisor for them to raise from THREE HUNDRED) in one single day.  So now I'm pigeon holed into using my credit card for it.  When I was a poor 18 year old kid, my credit card didn't have a limit for that.  That effectively keeps me from buying what I want from new egg.  In fact this situation happened and I had to get cash from the bank bringing ID, give it to my mom and use her credit card since she had a higher limit.  
In conclusion, Redfel, fuck you for harping on me for trying to:
A) help get the reddit community together to make a meaningful impact for many people already involved in Bitcoin.  Yes I want my bitcoins to grow in value, don't you?   Fuck you for insinuating that's evil of me to do.
B) Being a cock sucker on the internet.  
Disclaimer: I fully believe in Bitcoin, but not at its current stage.  I believe we have unleashed the technology to make all sorts of cool ideas happen but the tools, infrastructure, software and time just haven't happened yet.  Yes I want Bitcoin to prosper, for my own benefit and for everyone on this worlds benefit.

I'd like one but I'm worried someone will have the private key before they ship it.
