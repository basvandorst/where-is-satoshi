It takes an awfully long time to make the total $35K back in saved electricity.

Right but the name of highfrequency trading kind of explains it.  If you are trying to do many trades a second it should be cost prohibitive if each one is going to cost $10.  Maybe I have it wrong but my understanding is that no matter how much you pay you can't currently get a transaction quicker than 10 minutes.

Please stop doing this.  We all know the price and posts like this just push actual information off the main page as people vote it up for reasons that escape me.

The high transaction cost is a good thing ! So is the minimum 10 minute time..... if you want bitcoin to be a store of value and the price to keep going up.  Those together guarantee that you, a human, have a chance in this market instead of it being ruled by megacorp super computers using tiny price movements, massive leverage, millisecond trading and trade prices so low all the above is  enabled for them and a barrier for you.   I ADORE the fact that Goldman Sachs has to pay the same high transaction fee as I do.  Some other coin can be stuck with a basically fixed price and used for everyday transactions.

What company is taking gold to buy bitcoin directly?   If that  answer is few or none then maybe that should tell you something about what they value now.

Confirmed.  Same for me.   They don't get much press being in Canada but from everything I've seen they are doing a damn good job.  Were very fast to handle BCH fork and credit accounts and pretty quick after Bitcoin Gold finally had code too.

You are confusing the terms money and value. If you want to have value outside of anyone's control or ability to view records of it you can just as easily, perhaps more, buy gold coins.  You can redeem gold for cash anywhere in the world, literally.  Bitcoin isn't there yet. 
 
Bitcoins advantage is the ability to conduct transactions, at a distance, quickly, anonymously.  That isn't about holding them.  That they happen to gain value is merely a nice current side effect of a currency that isn't inflated at a crazy rate.  Deflation is a wonderful thing.

So Mastercard is attempting to patent the Lightning network ?

You must be kidding. BBT isn't a show for smart people.  It's a caricature of what stupid people think smart people are like so they can laugh at them and feel cooler/better.  Effect will be zero as nobody watching BBT wants to be like what the actual characters on the show are like.

Problem is kiddie users upvoting memes instead of information, not lack of information posted.

No currency is inflationary or deflationary.  It all depends on demand.  If there are no more units being produced of coin X, then that is only deflationary if demand is increasing.  If demand for the currency X is decreasing than it's value will go down even though there are no new ones being made.  It's a market.

Particularly for governments that couldn't inflate away their debts.  They tried to by putting less and and less of the real metal in but people aren't stupid so the old coins became more valuable than what was marked on their face.

.... vs the increase in the GDP.  If it increases less than the GDP you still have deflation.
