No, this guy is an idiot. TrueCrypt has passed audit after audit. If you want to follow TrueCrypt and see the software that picked up where they left off, check out VeraCrypt

Thank you, this was exactly what I was looking for!

Awesome project! I'm excited to see the GitHub release once you're done.

You know, I'm beginning to grow tired of the idea that Windows is so inherently insecure and that your Bitcoins will just go poof if you use them on Windows.
I think a lot of people are making the assumption that if you are using Windows then you are an incompetent user and do not know how to secure your system. If you are holding Bitcoin on any OS, regardless of Windows, you should be aware of the importance of proper security.

All the fraudsters are from Romania, so it makes sense for them to be easily able to cash out their Bitcoins in Romania.
Services such as Western Union and MoneyGram no longer allow USA transfers to come in because it is that bad.
EDIT: People downvoting are idiots.

Really good comment, someone up this guy.
@_date: 2015-08-12 04:28:25
More than likely this is just some fluff bullshit they throw at people when they ask "Well, doh, if we invest in a bitcoin company how can we be sure we're not facilitating criminal activity?". Response: "well guys.. we also have a super sweet company that does the same thing walletexplorer.com does! The great thing about it is that most people are ignorant to how bitcoin transactions and markets really work and they will pay for this useless information!"

No use arguing with the guy who uses the word pwned. I can't match your level of brilliance and technical knowledge.

Perfect dissection indeed.

This won't last. PayPal will ultimately close your account down and then you will be faced with the decision of either keep operating while using shady tactics or move to a different payment option.
Sorry for your eventual loss of your PayPal account.

Great work and contribution.

Hm, seems like an honest mistake and I guess it could've been a far worse problem rather than a $60 one. 
Maybe try adding an extra "Are you sure? You must have the private key to this address and use XXX client to redeem this token." type notification before sending.
This makes me wonder if any of the addresses I've ever used in my lifetime have any tokens attached to them via a overlaying protocol.

I can't remember the URL, but there is a site that offers a SaaS type trading platform. I really liked the idea and it was a low monthly subscription.
Oh yeah, it's  which is now zeroblock. Don't know if they have upgraded the platform any, but it was pretty nice when it first came out.
@_date: 2015-08-02 03:48:28
lmao, sell your bullshit somewhere else. We already have QT Bitcoin Trader: 
Why buy this bullshit? Bitcoin has the spirit of open source.

The big question is how can they discern if a transaction is criminally tainted? The only way I see that being able to be done is mapping out various transactions and wallets. In order to connect identities to those transactions they would have to invade / purchase identifying information from other Bitcoin related companies that store your info: Coinbase, Circle, etc.
Sounds like they are some wannabe dog the bounty hunters for Bitcoin and they have no clue what they are talking about. We can already log on walletexplorer.com and view darknet market wallets. What can they provide beyond this without doing some sketchy shit?
@_date: 2015-07-15 08:59:26
Yeah... you totally missed the whole point.
Skype isn't secure.

Are there open source Mycelium servers much like Electrum? 
If not, we need some. I don't like the idea of the 3 central points of failure.

Good, good. I was rather disgusted by that slated article of Vice's.
@_date: 2015-07-15 03:31:13
I see what you did there.

Show him how to drop those techie buzzwords bro!
@_date: 2015-07-01 05:38:56
This is obviously truth.
I really, really doubt someone would take THAT MUCH time to conjure up a fake document like this.
We all pretty much guessed it was something like this.
Why in the hell does everyone use Skype anyway? So weak. 
Why didn't BitStamp just release this to the public? I mean, really? 
@_date: 2015-07-10 07:00:43
Wow, you're a real dick and go against everything Bitcoin stands for and you represent everything that is wrong with the financial industry in it's current state.
Kick the weak, sure.
@_date: 2015-08-16 05:37:24
Can you link us to sources where we can view that material in question to come to the conclusions ourselves?
That's the problem I'm seeing here. So much censoring is happening and I feel like people are trying to make up my mind for me. I can't get an accurate picture and comparison because information is being snubbed out almost immediately.
@_date: 2015-07-15 03:30:50
Good point.
@_date: 2015-07-15 08:59:57
Right... We found the one who did it, so we are laying a trap? How about if you found the guy, you go grab him.

You haven't heard of assets on the decentralized exchange that are virtual USD pegged at $1?
@_date: 2015-09-18 06:01:48
Hasn't this already been done?
Can't platforms such as Counterparty already accomplish this?
It would be nice for people to start assimilating into an open-source project and combining all their efforts together, rather than to keep re-inventing the wheel with a different set of spokes.
@_date: 2015-11-03 06:52:47
I hate to say it, but damn, it would sure be convenient for OKCoin to manipulate their futures market, wouldn't it? 
Just margin call this whale then push the price back down to normal.
I've seen it happy one too many times...

Hey OP,
I know you weren't thinking when you posted this, but Coinbase doesn't allow it's users to send/receive Bitcoin from gambling sites.
Let me know how this works out and if your account comes under fire because of this. I'm curious, because support answered below like all was well.
