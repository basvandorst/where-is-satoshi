Lol he’s more oldschool than that. He’s a ‘50s kid. He was late 30s early 40s during the ‘80s.

Also a noob. I think you want an exchange. I'm using Gemini and so far I like it. I linked to my bank so I can transfer USD instantly. You can then buy and sell  btc and eth. But ether is only altcoin supported.

I would send an email to customer service they should take care of you.

Yes, I use a small local bank. Bank charged me $20 for wire fee. Gemini put extra $20 in my tradeable funds. Then a couple of clicks and a few hours and ACH was confirmed. Now I can deposit instantly.

The point is they don't have the cash. This is gambling with someone else's money.

I don't know about wire refunds. I think ACH is limited to $500/day. Wires are not limited.

Split it. Buy half now, half after.

You missed the use (purchase) part of equation.

If you are selling 0.1 btc for local fiat, couldn't you have the 0.1 btc on a paper wallet? I assume the ATM can scan the QR codes for this to work. The ATM should have the connection to send and confirm the transaction.
BTW I am a complete noob and just thinking out loud here.
Edit: just realized that would mean giving your private code to the ATM which is probably a bad idea. Hey I told you I was a noob.

Gemini works
@_date: 2017-03-23 14:12:23
Same for me. But Gemini refunds wire fee and once fist wire goes through you can set up ACH. Then it's smooth sailing.

The exchange I use (Gemini) pays the fee so all $20. Same with cashapp which I’ve used once so far.

No. You win.

Whatever you can. $10 a week is $40/month is $520/yr and that's better than zero.

The white paper was 2008.

This is what I meant their change output was bc1 and their from address was bc1 but my to address could not be bc1.

I just used cash app for first time and it works great. Fund app instantly with debit card. Then buy bitcoin instantly with funds. The spread worked out to about 1% when I did it.

I use Gemini. Fees are 0.25%. I have been buying in $10 increments for the past 10weeks or so.
