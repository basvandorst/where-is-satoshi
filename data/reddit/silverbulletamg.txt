We didn't have the halving as close this time last year.  No guarantee of course but, makes me slightly more optimistic this year vs. last years fire sale.  I'd be fine with a quick $4K sale price though! :-)

Step  - still laughing at you...

Patience....keep your magic beans.  You only lose if you sell at a loss.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:34:11
Fire sale!  Buy, buy, buy!
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:36:54
You saw the rise and are asking why to stay invested?  Selling at a loss is or break even point is ridiculous.  You didn't sell at it's height or the way down so you must not have been looking for a quick buck or you would have jumped when it was at $20K.  Long term is always HODL.

Guaranteed winning loto ticket right there.  Amazon, Intel, Google, Facebook stocks (to name but a few) would also be good.

As he said....buy BTC when it comes out......HODL.....sell at $20K and retire "comfortably".  Same with buying the mentioned stocks which will go on to be worth MUCH more.  Hence, all guaranteed loto tickets (figuratively).

Not saying you didn't get scammed but, you can't just allege a "scam" and then get someones personal info...
@_date: 2019-10-17 18:11:51
It is waaaay more likely to hit $20K+ than it is to hit $1K again.  However, agree with your overall point.

Those that are panic selling at a loss will be kicking themselves hard down the road....

If all of those stated assumptions were true, you'd be able to answer your own question.

You don't need $500K or anywhere near that to start mining.  Obviously, the more items you having mining (GPUs, ASICs) the more you'll make but, if you're just looking to get start small, a GPU rig is fairly straight forward and you can more or less pick a price point to get started (cheap CPU, cheap ram, cheap motherboard, good PSU, good cooling solution and good GPU(s) and you're up and running more or less).  Check out some of the auto-miner forums for more specifics (nicehash, awesome miner, cudo miner, etc.).
That said, nothing wrong with buying small amounts and stacking outright....or better yet, do both! ;-)

Well go on....do tell?!  I have my tinfoil hat on and I'm ready to learn...

$1,800 BTC again?  Shut up and take my money!  But really though....shitpost

I was "folding" around that time and guys started talking about mining as doing something similar but getting paid for it.  They'd make a few pennies a day (just like now if mining with anything other than ASICs...lol) and unfortunately for me, I didn't bother early on and stuck with "folding" over "mining".

Not sure how broad your "they" is regarding miners but personally.....HODL.  That said, I'm only running a few rigs and it isn't a "job" or sole source of income.  Those that mine as a business would need to sell most of what they mine simply to keep the lights on.

Almost anything that starts out with "Congratulations!" now days is most def a [scam.lol](  Maybe you'll get lucky and receive an email letting you know you inherited millions overseas... ;-)

Scam.  Curious how he tried to explain how you triple your money after 48hrs though?
@_date: 2019-12-17 17:24:13
Can totally relate...lol
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:28:54
You've waited this long....tt would be absolutley rediculous to sell now at such a loss.  HODL is the only reasonable option IMO.  The bigger issue is why you didn't tell your wife up front about the investement.  Tell her now and her next thought will be "what else is he hiding from me" and once that thought sets in, you're screwed.  HODL and STFU. ;-)

Apparently grammar and basic math went to shit in 2021 as well...
