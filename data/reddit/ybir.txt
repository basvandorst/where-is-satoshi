But you don't actually believe that, right? You should be a politician with your whole "technically correct but we all know wrong" spiel.

lol. Could you imagine? BitCoin inflates to like a million as more and more old people figure out how to use it. Then over the course of 12 hours Russia's GDP is decimated as the bubble bursts. There's a reason you're not in charge of anything.

My hand-made translation for my American friends:
The Russian Government Sees BitCoin as Threat to the State.
The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation plans to take all necessary measures for the introduction of penalties for the use of cryptocurrencies within the country. This was recently announced by the Deputy Finance Minister, Alexei Moiseev. The situation surrounding BitCoin in Russia has significantly deteriorated. Before, remarks from officials were of a more cautioning nature, now things have completely changed.


"I suppose that this law, like all the other laws aimed at state regulation of the internet will be used manually. I don't think that the Central Bank of Russia or some other agency will be scanning the Internet in search of people using cryptocurrencies. This law will be used to selectively go after people who the state wants to eliminate. That is, it will be just another legal tool in the government's arsenal, which can be used on anyone, but I do not think it will actually be deployed on everyone indiscriminately" said Artem Kozlyuk, one of the founders of the movement against censorship on the Internet.
It is likely that the enforcement of this law will be limited to select persons, perhaps unscrupulous policemen will no longer plant bags of drugs, but instead opt for a flash stick with a Bitcoin wallet.
However, because of the technology of Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency users in Russia will not disappear. But the promising, albeit informal, cryptocurrency market will go to Western companies. A similar situation arose in connection with retaliatory sanctions from Russia on the West: substituting the lost imports turned out to be a distant dream, but the newly-liberated market is gradually coming under the influence of China. For example, the company Alibaba recently began working in Russia. As a result, it's expected there will be a big shift from European goods to Chinese, with a complete lack of competitiveness from Russian production.
"The law on surrogate currencies will put a definitive end to companies accepting cryptocurrencies. Before it was something they just didn't want to do, but after the introduction of the law it will direct penalties.", - added Artem Kozlyuk.


Judging by the news of this year, this result for Bitcoin in Russia was inevitable. One gets the impression that the Russian authorities are very consistent and warn of their intentions in advance. In the beginning of this year there was [an incident with BitCoin assets being blocked]( and some time later the deputy from the Liberal Democratic Party, which is implicitly considered the mouthpiece of the ruling party, said that bitcoin is a CIA plot against Russia. 
"Yes, it's another step to regress and repressive measures on the web. This artificial inhibition of progress, knowledge and human interaction in a network. The state perceives this as a threat to its existence. That which is impossible to control and is hard for officials to understand - is forbidden"

Does your attention span last more than a single post? You should take a second to re-read the original argument.

I don't think we should vilify these people. They are preforming an attack on the bitcoin protocol. I think people should look at this as a technical challenge that should be fixed before someone less honest performs it.
