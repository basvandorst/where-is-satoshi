You mean in 2017? That's a joke. It should have been last year. You'll see next year they will come up with another reason to not raise the blocksize again. They have been doing it every year.

Cool, when we find them it will be too late to fix and it will be because of people like you who have some weird fascination with blockstream. Like a mosquito flying into the blue light.

When did it become a dictator ship that needed a Coup d'Etat. Why do you guys all sound the same?

You're okay with 500 lines of buggy code for 1.3x increase in space?

As a user I can say i support classic. I can't see why a user would support block streams plans of turning bitcoin into a settlement layer for large transactions.

At 34 min in the youtube video it says that we need 133MB blocks. Interesting.

Wow hey there big guy, 5 months?! You're as old as the Pyramids. 
Common sense and every major pool saying that a 1.3x increase in space is not worth rewriting that much consensus code that hasn't even been tested for a year.
We'll see what the ecosystem outside of block stream thinks about it. 
Doesn't look good for you guys, you have one crappy wallet provider that nobody uses.

500 lines of code in consensus critical system that could end up producing different results on hundreds of different OS and CPU combinations. Not even tested for a year and they want to roll this thing out in a couple of month. What happened to their high standards?

Fun fact: if the 1.2 million subscribers to this sub where the only people using BTC they could only make or receive one payment every 4 days.
