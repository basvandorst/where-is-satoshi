SHA-256 is powerfull , it doesn't matter who invented if we understand how the algorithm works (full of math totally crazy )

This is cool!
@_date: 2019-12-20 15:38:52
Very interesting, thanks

Lol, I didn't know that, I recommended it because was my first wallet. And now to be clear the best wallets are Cold wallets.

Yes, I agree with ₿ as symbol and logo. Probably we will see more often as a standard

in which way AI would be a threat to bitcoin?, in the case of quantum computing, yes, t's probably the second threat to bitcoin followed from a 51% attack, I think cryptographic will get notable advances (ie: new cryptographic algorithms) that will ensure the blockchain against quatum computing in future.

And who is in charge of maintaining these ATM machines?
@_date: 2019-12-02 05:42:09
Yes. although  cryptographic in blockchain use the same cipher algorithms  we know were implemented in SO, internet protocols (https, ssh, rdp, ssl),  SHA, MD5, Ripemd, hashes and many others. I would say there is only one cryptographic concept for everything.

Make banks useless, as it should have to be

How much will cost BTC in those years?
@_date: 2019-12-02 22:13:42
There's a lot of talent
@_date: 2019-12-02 04:48:21
it deserves more :D
@_date: 2019-12-05 12:53:05
Bitcoin is the first app of Blockchain
@_date: 2019-12-21 13:40:29
It's good to know. I think there can be a lot of companies doing this in their own regions.

wow, that's insane...
