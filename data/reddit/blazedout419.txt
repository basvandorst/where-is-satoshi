How else do you trade them if they are not on an exchange? Bitcoin is not instant and if I see the market moving that 3-6 confirms takes too long. More like leave only what you are comfortable risking on exchanges.

Last night I used gyft.com for some gift cards. The process took maybe 5 minutes from start to finish (same as if I used my CC).

I do not think Roger wants to harm Bitcoin at all. I think in his mind he is trying to fix it (personally I think it is fine and am excited for SW). Not sure why the other sub is so bat shit crazy, but I just ignore them or put on my tin foil hat before entering it...
@_date: 2016-04-07 19:00:20
Looks like it sold for 86 BTC. Once the deal is complete and if you decide on trusting the new owner it should be back to normal I suppose.
@_date: 2016-04-26 20:54:15
You just can't fix stupid I guess. Anyone who owns 200+ BTC should at least know how to transfer them. 
@_date: 2016-04-04 13:37:45
Well, if you had small children I think your view would change a lot. First of all they are homeless and I am sure lots of new people come an go often. I hate to say this, but homeless people likely have issues...why else would any normal person end up homeless? I get that bad things happen to good people, but how hard is it to get a job. 
@_date: 2016-04-04 13:13:31
I am saying there should be rules (maybe there is?) that keep a camp say 10 miles from a normal neighborhood is all. I do not want to treat them as sub human or anything. Would you want a bunch of homeless people in your backyard?
@_date: 2016-04-04 13:49:34
Well, I think we should be able to discuss other options. I am 100% behind Core, but that could change one day. It is always good to have other people offering ideas up. 
@_date: 2016-04-03 02:49:37
Andreas is amazing...by far the best public figure Bitcoin could ever have. 
@_date: 2016-04-04 23:30:44
Come on now...you guys axed XT and Classic pretty fast around here. I am not saying this sub should be a free for all, but Theymos clearly stated his opinions on them and they are not allowed here.
@_date: 2016-04-04 11:58:16
You have some links to this? I have donated to them in the past and never heard they were scamming?
@_date: 2016-04-08 02:59:56
The discount sounds great, but that is why I will never use this service or others like it. If you get goods from the wrong person it could cause some serious headaches and that is just not worth it.
@_date: 2016-04-04 11:57:27
I can not blame those folks that live next to the tent city. I have kids and would not want a bunch of homeless people next to my backyard. It is a shame people are homeless, but they should be far from regular people's houses and children. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 20:56:17
Not the protocols fault it has dumb users.

The day that AA says he gives up on Bitcoin is the day we should be worried.
@_date: 2016-04-01 12:18:12
Shrem is in jail because he helped launder money (he knew what he was doing). He was telling people how to avoid government attention such as avoiding SARs and how to structure payments. Long story short if you do not apply for a MSB you can likely be messed with.
@_date: 2016-04-04 11:28:12
At first, that sub was nice due to the silly amount of censorship over here. People needed a place to discuss alternate clients as that sort of discussion is good to have. Now is just tin foil hat conspiracy's and Core/Blockstream haters. I agree that sub does look bad for Bitcoin, but it is a very small group that are just very vocal.
@_date: 2016-04-07 13:32:56
Bitbet is currently being auctioned off due to hilarious circumstances. Pretty sure if you send anything right now it will be a "donation". 
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:35:26
Not a chance you removed the sticker and it looks fine. I have traded these coins for years and the "stickers" are actually tamper resistant holograms. When you peel them it completely ruins the look (leaves a honeycomb effect). Casascius coins also contain all the forks...
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:38:38
Tim makes some amazing coins. I also collect the Titan coins.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:48:56
Good looking out!
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:45:52
Never... I have always called them Bitcoins and will never change. What is wrong with saying "send me .004 BTC"?
@_date: 2018-08-25 03:37:03
Yes there is a password reset option (I used it). You need to know your security question answer though. The reset email came almost instantly.

He got screwed sentence wise, but no way he was a hero. Helping to fuel drug users is a terrible thing. People are mostly too stupid to control themselves.
@_date: 2017-02-11 18:30:44
So the only reason for not liking Core and SF SegWit is because /rbitcoin is censored? We get it already this sub is censored, but why hurt Bitcoin over that? People take reddit way too serious. Reddit is really only good for funny pictures anyways. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 15:20:16
"after the fact fee bumping" I have been waiting for this for quite a while! Great job Core, and thanks for all your hard work etc...

He should not have a key at this point. He did his thing and has left the building under that name. I would be surprised if he is not still here under a different name.

I think over time they will realize it is the only true legit USA exchange we have so far. 
@_date: 2016-03-11 13:07:00
Darn...I was wanting to invest 1 BTC and turn it into .5 after some defaults 
@_date: 2016-03-16 13:17:12
I am "Blazed" on  and Bitcointalk. He fell for the similar named scam. I have seen this happen a lot both places unfortunately. OTC has plenty of measures in place to prevent this, but he was new and not aware of them. We spoke in the channel after...sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2016-03-28 12:22:58
I am amazed that Gemini is not bigger than it currently is. I feel like every other US exchange is amateur hour compared to them regulation wise.
@_date: 2016-03-04 12:53:43
While I do not recommend it for a newer user I use Armory. I know a lot of newer people really like MultiBit, Electrum, and Mycelium. Once you get fully addicted to Bitcoin check out Armory!
@_date: 2016-03-22 12:03:49
I think he got railroaded for his crimes and was made into an example, but free him? Yeah right... No matter what the guy ran a website that sold drugs to people. There is no way they would ever let him out. Why anyone thinks this is just silly. Find something better to dedicate your time to.
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:33:39
We need to steal him away from Monero and have him work on Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-03-22 12:11:02
The Classic guys will have no use for these unless AWS/Choopa spins these up...j/k. I think these are a great idea and hope home users continue to get devices like these. I personally run a Core node on an old box to help do my part.
@_date: 2017-01-13 19:25:52
Use Gemini they always do my transfers amazingly fast. Every ACH from them (supposed to take 3 days) is in my account after 2 days. The wire transfers are next day without fail. If you sell on their exchange there is no question of it getting canceled etc...
@_date: 2018-10-01 17:14:48
Erik did a great job in this debate and was pretty funny while doing it. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:12:50
I hope it is Gemini and that they finally get approval for the ETF.

Says the guy who lost people's Bitcoins via instawallet. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 16:02:45
Beautiful coin you have! I am sure you do not want to sell it, but I do know a few people who would make you solid offers on it. I am an avid Casascius collector myself, but that is out my league. I understand people here think having a loaded coin by someone else is bad, but Mike did it the right way and I have 0 fears of the keys ever being leaked. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:13:33
I need pictures for an accurate price. Some Casascius coins command nice premiums while others not so much. I am well known in the Casascius collector community on Bitcointalk. Feel free to send me pictures on the forum -&gt; 
@_date: 2016-12-07 12:50:34
Gemini is great and I have been using them since it opened up. Not that I trust an exchange, but out of all of them this one feels the most legit.
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:24:24
I would buy them from you on Bitcointalk if you wish to sell them. If you are interested hit me up -&gt; 
@_date: 2016-12-08 15:02:33
How anyone could ever trust that team over the 100+ core devs blows my mind. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:47:24
Actions speak louder than words. Most people already see the gridlock and know they can not change it so why bother?
@_date: 2016-11-28 01:07:48
Bobby, will you ever offer a service of loading someone elses coins? For example, say I have an address I generated and wanted fresh coins mined to it (like a full block). I assume you would need 2 blocks worth of coins held via escrow in case of accidental over funding.
@_date: 2016-12-13 17:20:04
Do people really use OB much? I tried it when it first launched and could not find stuff to buy. Wondering if it is time to check it out again or still wait longer.
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:23:58
I can not imagine anyone is actually surprised by this? Coinbase collects all that info knowing that they would get asked for this someday. You have to pay your taxes on BTC just like anything else that touches USD.
@_date: 2016-11-26 18:24:44
Making Roger a martyr is a bad idea and makes this sub stoop to their level. Just ignore the other sub and their crazy  rants and conspiracy theories. Anyone who visits over there can see they are crazy.
@_date: 2016-11-26 18:20:14
Adoption is moving a lot faster than I would have guessed. SegWit once activated will be great. Core simply keeps delivering over and over. Thanks Core devs!
@_date: 2016-12-08 12:27:49
Not voting for either proposal is voting. Maybe some miners are fine with how Bitcoin is right now and do not want to see any changes. Not voting for SW and a HF = leave it how it is. I know a lot of old time Bitcoiners who would be happy with Bitcoin being pretty much set in stone as-is.
@_date: 2016-11-16 18:22:52
It is not a ponzi, just a bad investment. Anyone who buys into cloud mining these days pretty much deserves the loss they take.
@_date: 2016-02-02 16:34:00
As with every Bitcoin mining investment...those who invest hold bags later on.
@_date: 2016-02-08 14:27:24
I think you got this backwards OP. Just post when it actually works and that is news! 
@_date: 2016-02-01 12:57:21
Classic is still a thing? I think that these other forks are good for us as it has made people like myself pay more attention to what is going on. Obviously, Core needs to remain the top choice, but look Core now has setup some social media...these forks have helped us!
@_date: 2016-02-11 21:57:34
Well said! I think that Coinbase is right to at least test it out , though. I think we all know that there is not a chance of us switching from core to classic. Classic and XT did at least bring the community together to voice their opinions which is a good thing.
@_date: 2016-02-28 22:26:36
Or...just pay the correct fee and you have no issues..
@_date: 2018-02-25 06:00:06
Sounds like a safe area of the world to live in...not. The idea is pretty cool, but good luck not having any sort of military protections.

@_date: 2016-05-07 05:38:18
It is an excuse for the other sub to bash Core. Anyone with a brain knows commit access is not needed for Gavin and Core is not bitcoin...just a client. 
@_date: 2016-05-07 16:23:43
If they block SW it is not like people will want Classic more. If anything it will make people dislike Classic even more for blocking progress.
@_date: 2016-05-07 16:25:05
I do not really sell my coins, but I sure do spend them. I see no reason to act any different about the halving unless maybe you mine and need the revenue for bills.
@_date: 2017-07-06 13:45:02
Well, it really depends on the lender. Mine was simple due to the clear paper trail. Sadly the banks hate cash since they can not track your every move. I would write a very detailed letter explaining the cash and see what they say. If your money is seasoned then you should not really have to explain it (seasoned means it has been in your account over 90 days).
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:48:33
I recently used Bitcoin as a part of my down payment. I sold my coins on Gemini and simply told the lender that. They asked me for proof so I printed out the sell orders and matched them to my incoming wires on my statements. I also write a letter explaining that Bitcoin was simply an asset I sold.
@_date: 2016-05-08 15:48:45
Slush split the "do not care" vote so Classic got some of those miners. 
@_date: 2016-05-08 15:50:31
Gemini is a good choice since they are the best licensed so far.
@_date: 2016-07-28 15:55:35
You may or not like him, but at least he admitted he was wrong. I respect it when people can admit to things like that as most just can not do so.
