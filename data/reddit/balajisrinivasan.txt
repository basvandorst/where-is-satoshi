Hi there - we do support payment channels now, actually! See here:
And here is an example of using it with a marketplace URL:
@_date: 2016-03-16 11:17:39
The idea is actually to minimize hassle - you would buy endpoints directly from 21.co, and we'd take care of data cleanup/aggregation/etc issues. The grid is definitely much more complex to handle than the cloud, but you as the end user wouldn't feel that complexity.
Regarding payments, you could do a subscription with a credit card, or you could do a one-off payment for bitcoin (a new option which is not possible right now with cloud services).
In terms of benefits, we think the [grid]( is going to offer a whole set of new functionality which is complementary to the cloud. Basically, the grid is the heterogeneous network of machines in homes and offices, while the cloud is the homogeneous set of servers in managed datacenters. Grid = Folding Cloud = AWS. Over the last 10-15 years, cloud computing has dominated grid computing because there has been no real way to _incentivize_ the grid. You'd need a way to do small, fast, international, payouts to many machines on the internet. That's what Bitcoin allows.
Finally, in terms of ratings/reputation, here's the relevant bit from the 21 CLI; see also 21.co/mkt, which has star ratings for endpoints.
    $ 21 rate --help
    Usage: 21 rate [OPTIONS] [APP_ID] [RATING]
    
      Rate an app listed in the 21 Marketplace.
    
      Usage
      _____
      Rate an app.
      $ 21 rate Xe8 3
          - Xe8 is the id of the app that you want to rate.  This id can be found with `21 search`.
          - 3 is the rating to apply. A rating should be an integer between 1-5.
      You can update the rating for an app at anytime with `21 rate`.
    
      List all the apps that you have rated.
      $ 21 rate --list
          
    
    Options:
      --list      List all the apps that you have rated.
      -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Well, monitoring uptime and latency of your site from multiple locations is important. Pingdom processed 273B events in 2015:
Not at $1000/month, but $450/month for enterprise: 
Anyway, pinging is just the simplest application - just wait :)
@_date: 2016-03-16 04:36:45
Try signing up at 21.co/free - coming soon :)
@_date: 2016-03-12 02:10:03
1) You can sign up for a free client at 21.co/free. When released, that'll give a lot of the functionality on most devices.
2) What a Bitcoin Computer provides is (a) a ready source of bitcoin, (b) a set of ports to plug in sensors and actuators, and (c) a small personal server with a reasonably large amount of disk space (128 GB). As you will see in subsequent blog posts, that combination of features allows you to have something on your desk that can buy and sell API calls into the marketplace, potentially making money for you in the background.
You can think of this as a generalization of bitcoin mining. Rather than sending hashes up to the network and getting bitcoin down, you can send other kinds of compute up to the network and get bitcoin down in return.
As a simple example, we'll be releasing code which will allow others to rent your device along with a fleet of others to do distributed uptime/latency checking (like Pingdom) or to do distributed performance testing (like Blazemeter). The "distributed" aspect here is important because you can only go so far in simulating real traffic from the confines of rented computers in a datacenter. The more realistic the test, the better.
So: basically, Bitcoin Computers are easy-to-rent grid computers that can buy and sell services to the grid in return for bitcoin. More here:

Must say I'm surprised at your tone. Read tweets and past work. Not the enemy nor fool you seem to be inventing.
Rootstock is in production? Did not know that, only see a white paper at rootstock.io. Sergio is a smart guy and may have set something up privately of course.
Hivemind is in production? I see an open source codebase linked from bitcoinhivemind.com that you have committed to. I don't actually see a prediction market running on the technology with active participants, showing off sidechains as a technology. Would love to see it when live.
Re: database, obviously there's a difference between the Blockchain and a typical database. The purpose of Postgres here is to provide a different kind of way to buffer a potentially very large volume of transactions before settling to the Blockchain.
Anyway, we may have different definitions of "production" grade and may be solving different problems. I hope Hivemind is a great success and I wish you well.
@_date: 2016-01-03 09:56:28
Well, according to this post:
Have not dug into current status.
@_date: 2016-01-06 12:06:04
I think the OP linked to  which we didn't set up as it's just a one page content site (I'm not sure how he got that link).
Try going to  and you shouldn't have a problem!
[We may set up SSL/HTTPS but it'll take a little bit]
@_date: 2016-01-02 20:56:00
Huh? Obviously you can run a laptop with the lid closed (if you don't want the second screen). But when you close the lid, pick it up, and walk away with it then it's not going to be on the same wifi connection nor be able to accommodate incoming requests. Laptops aren't servers.
Re edit, your invented quote ain't a quote! (You know, in the narrow and archaic sense of something I actually wrote or said.)
@_date: 2016-01-06 12:11:48
Hey guys - 
1) Go to  if you're interested in a MOOC version
2) Go to  to just browse the syllabus
3) You might have a certificate issue if you click OP's link; he put in an HTTPS link, but I'm not sure where he got that from as we hadn't set up HTTPS yet (it was just a simple static site). Maybe the browser autofilled it? Anyway, click  and you will be fine!

Shorter Paul Sztorc: "This guy is dumb! He should be promoting the thing I'm working on!" :)
But in seriousness, I have nothing against you or your work. Let me enumerate premises:
1) Lightning is great. Go ahead and ask Joe and Tad if I/we understand it. I think very highly of them, but LN is not out yet and definitely not yet in large scale production. This is meant to support a different kind of off-chain use case.
2) Sidechains are also great. Go ask Adam and Austin if we're aware of them :) But deploying a new sidechain is not yet a routine activity. Liquid is the only sidechain in production.
3) Postgres is widely deployed, in production, and very well understood.
4) People are already doing off chain transactions in many different ways. There's no consistent way to do that. Many of these ways include recording intermediate state in databases, often Postgres. These applications are not going to be entirely subsumed by Sidechains and/or Lightning because (for example) some of them require a degree of speed/realtime settlement/volume that those technologies are not intended to provide.
5) There's no Postgres extension for Bitcoin datastructures. There will be. Integrating full JSON into Postgres 9.4 gave a good alternative to running a separate NoSQL database. Now you could just run Postgres rather than that plus another DB. In the same way, baking Bitcoin support into Postgres via a PostChain would obviate the need to run two databases (it'd be good if this was the path that the Linux Foundation and Hyperledger were taking, though haven't seen any news on that).
Net: in technology speed, simplicity, and reliability do matter. The Postgres extension I described in the tweets is very simple to get out as a v1. It's just serialization and deserialization of existing well documented datastructures along with a function to take some BTC and post a summary of that (maybe a collapsed subset of equivalent txs, maybe a hash) to the Blockchain. A simple solution like this is complementary to Sidechains/Lightning as it can be stood up rapidly and has no limits on transaction volume, scale, or size.
PS: Insofar as we are talking about well known technologies, see these tweets:


If you are building a business: mature open source code that already exists, that has run in production for years, and that you can easily/cheaply/quickly extend is usually the right choice if you can make it fit the use case.
@_date: 2016-01-02 21:01:44
Well, you came out swinging first at the top of the thread if you reread your post:) I don't think I actually toned down the reply, just added tweets, but meant no offense. Anyway, be well!

Hi all: I recommend listening to the full interview as I don't think this headline is a representative summary. Neither I nor 21.co have taken any position in the block size debate. In the interview, I tried my best to steelman and paraphrase the best arguments for both sides.
For example, one thing that I did say is that the DAO precedent may limit Ethereum's ability to compete with BTC as digital gold; this is not present in the linked summary of the (hourlong) interview.
Anyway, listen for yourself if you want.
@_date: 2016-02-13 08:09:44
Bitcore's implementation is great, but it's fairly low level. You need to manually do things like this:
    assert(consumer.validateRefund(messageFromProvider));
    sendToProvider(consumer.incrementPaymentBy(400 * SATOSHIS));
    sendToProvider(consumer.incrementPaymentBy(4 * BITS));
Our implementation does cover that low-level use case with both a [library]( and a corresponding [command line]( tool.
However, what we are really focused on is a higher-level use case - namely, making micropayments *easy*. You'll have to decide for yourself whether we accomplished that, but here's some [sample code]( that sets up a little payment channels capable server:
    import datetime
    import flask
    from two1.lib.wallet import Wallet
    from two1.lib.bitserv.flask import Payment
        
    app = flask.Flask(__name__)
    payment = Payment(app, Wallet())
    
    
    def current_time():
        return str(datetime.datetime.now())
  
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000, debug=True)
The `payment.required` line is the key bit that charges 50 satoshis per request. Assuming that server is running on localhost at port 5000, here's a corresponding client:
    from two1.lib.wallet import Wallet
    from two1.lib.bitrequests import ChannelRequests
    requests = ChannelRequests(Wallet())
    response = requests.get("
    print(response.text)
All the payment channel and 402 logic is thus handled in the background and you can just request the URL like a standard HTTP-accessible resource -- so long as your local wallet has a nonzero Bitcoin balance to set up the initial deposit transaction. We do think this allows you to program at a somewhat higher level of abstraction as you'd otherwise have to implement all that logic on top of the low-level stuff. See for example [this tutorial]( where we show how to set up a simple grid computer that rents out read/write access for bitcoin.

No :) Blocks are being mined, they just aren't being labeled in block explorers.

Just FYI: the cointape author is working with us, and was actually a co-author on the [blog post]( announcing this. Christian didn't have the bandwidth to independently maintain the project, but we thought it was useful to the community so we provided support for it. And if you go to cointape.com it should also redirect to bitcoinfees.21.co to provide continuity of service :)

Hey guys - this is Balaji S. Srinivasan of 21 here.
We'd actually already thought through many of the questions here. Not saying we are right in every respect, but it is pretty magical to start working with Bitcoin as a first class citizen within a Linux environment -- and it's been a good amount of systems integration (from silicon through OS through CLI through cloud) to get it to that point.
Think of today's release as just the first batch of stuff we're putting out. We haven't yet shown you the software (most of which will be [open-sourced]( or all the demos of things you can do with it. With that said, we wrote a few tweets that give further color on what we're trying to do:
- [You can't easily and instantly buy small quantities of Bitcoin on demand, nor buy in every country, nor buy if you are a machine](
- [Think of a mining chip as a kind of transformer. Turn power from the wall into Bitcoin: convenient micropayments.](
- [The goal: flick on a new paid internet service like you turn on a new lightbulb. No ads, no signup.](
And I think the following comments were pretty good in terms of figuring out from the [blog post]( what you can do with a device like this: [1]( [2]( [3]( [4]( [5]( [6]( [7]( [8](
But I/we would love to schedule an AMA and answer more questions! Not sure about the process for that but an email to reddit.ama at 21 dot co should work. The schedule is a little packed right now ([eg]( so it won't be tomorrow, but we will figure out a time.
PROOF this is me: 
@_date: 2015-11-14 23:14:55
Hi blahcentral: this is Balaji Srinivasan here from 21. Everything you code on a 21 Bitcoin Computer is your intellectual property, not 21's. We will revise the FAQ to make this explicit. Please do get in touch at support at 21 dot co if you have any related questions!
@_date: 2015-11-21 08:20:12
tl;dr - this hack won't work for long, but we gotta thank this "ButtcoinEE" guy for his volunteer labor in building a time-limited free trial :) 
We'll have an official open source release soon. In the meantime, if you like hacking stuff go ahead and apply for a job at [21.co/jobs]( Or, if you _really_ don't have money and are a student or otherwise have demonstrable financial need, contact support and we'll see what we can do.
**Longer version**
Go download this and try this out while you can! But just as an FYI, off-device use in this fashion is going to be disabled in the next versions of the software ([21 update]( as we'll be asking the 21 client for proof-of-work, among other things, which will require a 21 Bitcoin Computer with a mining chip.
If you do install the 21 update, which is free for everyone with the 21 Bitcoin Computer, you won't see anything change plus you'll get a bunch of bug fixes and new stuff.
If you don't install the 21 update (and you can't if you're off-device), then most functionality in the old 21 client will be disabled -- including anything that contacts the server side, including 21 status and so on. You also won't be able to join the [21 Network]( to do peer-to-peer transactions or publish to the [21 Marketplace]( when that functionality is released without a 21 Bitcoin Computer as those will be doing the same checks.
I want to make clear that we're not doing this *just* because we're pure evil (though there is always that, muhuhaha!). We actually have several good reasons:
1) First, we want to support a clean full stack environment for Bitcoin programming. That's made much easier if our 21 update is installing on the same piece of hardware on every node in the network, and if the packages you install are all compiled for the same architecture, and so on. We are trying to build the first standardized Bitcoin environment that Just Works (tm); that's made easier if we can lock down the hardware. As Alan Kay put it, [“People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.”](
2) Second, we want to make sure that the first group of buyers and sellers in the [21 Marketplace]( are folks who've bought a 21 Bitcoin Computer. This ensures a higher basal level of trust and will be one of the first functioning digital goods marketplaces using Bitcoin -- which will be good for Bitcoin.
3) Third, as we'll get into in a blog post, the fact that the 21 Bitcoin Computer is also usable as an inexpensive little *home server* is key. It means you can leave it on and have it service requests in the background. A laptop really isn't built for that - if you close the lid, your buyer can't reach you. [EDIT: By "close the lid", we mean "close the lid and pick it up and walk away". Laptops aren't made to be up 24/7; if you use them as servers, they are no longer mobile or as useful as laptops. Moreover, client-side reboots initiated by you as a user will affect the customers of your server, etc.] You can always go cloud, but that's now a fair bit more effort + nonzero cost, and many of the interesting things you can do with Bitcoin may not be possible if you're using an AWS IP (like the [HTTP proxy example]( 
4) Fourth, many of the techniques we're using here (as well as others) will be used to protect you as a seller if you get a 21 Bitcoin Computer and are selling digital goods and services in the 21 Marketplace. You will probably experience a higher attempted double spend rate, for example, if selling a digital good to someone who didn't buy a device. As a seller you'll have a different worldview.
5) Fifth, we actually DO have a pretty good open source package that we'll be releasing in the not-too-distant future which will be complementary to what you get on the 21 Bitcoin Computer. We just want to release that in a careful and thought-through way. I do subscribe to Tom Preston-Werner's dictum of ["Open Source Almost Everything"]( but where and when is important. We want your open source experience to be a non-buggy one with corner cases solved on enough platforms, so give us a little time.
**Big picture**
We totally get that it's fun to try to circumvent stuff and find holes. This was a pretty obvious thing to try, but we knew it'd be easy to fix it if it happened, so we're fixing it.
Just like you guys, we aren't bankers, we are hackers, and we are looking for people who are crazy enough to spend a Friday night reading this thread to try to save a bit of money by downloading and running new kinds of Bitcoin software.
If you like doing that kind of thing, apply for a job at [21.co/jobs]( and you'll definitely make more USD or BTC than you will save by running the software off-device for a few days before we have an update. 
And we do have a budget for charity and community, so if you really do have a demonstrable financial need (particularly if you are a student or represent an underserved group), get in touch at support and we'll see if we can help you out!

Pinged you on Twitter; looking forward to meeting. We've been thinking about this for some time in terms of both software and hardware implementation.
Here's our very high level take on it from the hardware end of things:
The short version is that (a) mining pools arguably weren't anticipated by Satoshi and (b) running a mining pool is sort of like holding the One Ring. Today it's a necessary evil, but in the long term no one really wants that kind of power as it centralizes Bitcoin. (Indeed, even today's pool operators don't want to be close to 51%.)
The ideal long-term scenario would be widespread hardware/software support such that every device (or a critical mass) had the ability to join an ad-hoc pool, along with a large enough variety of Bitcoin-payable endpoints ( such that any economic inefficiencies due to decentralized conversion of power into bitcoin from a v2 p2pool were overcome by the convenience factor of no ads and no signups for an increasing variety of online services.
At that point, mining is for massively distributed convenience (time savings) rather than direct economic return. It's convenient to have digital currency to pay for things online, to pay with your power rather than your privacy. 
We know that convenience has economic value, because time has economic value. That's been established in other domains at large scale -- wait time greatly influences whether someone calls an Uber, page load speed greatly influences whether someone visits a site, and checkout complexity greatly influences whether someone buys something from an ecommerce site. We'll see if it's also true in Bitcoin at comparable scale. If so, it may relax some of the design constraints around a v2 p2pool.
