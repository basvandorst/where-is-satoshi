Government coins will have difficulties getting traction. Venezuelas Petro is an example.

My area of expertise is aviation. I read news about this and they have absolutely no understanding at all, but I turn the page and think the other stuff ought to be more correct.
Last years I look for other sources of information. 
For financial news rt.com and Zerohedge.com are better.

Better to make friends in the long run

Don't be sorry, it was a relevant question. You're jus ahead of most people in your critical thinking. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 06:04:32
Lowest fees and best exchange rates. Not so user friendly, but you get used to it.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:32:27
And then the exchange shuts down due to massive trading

A tax aimed at banks will eventually be a cost for the users.

The monetary (€$£¥) system is about to fall down the toilet. People don't underst and they don't care. Bitcoin, gold and silver is going down in price, maybe by market manipulation.
I am just surprised of the stupidity and ignorance of the crowd.

Funny, I always thought a quarter was 25 cents.

You are right. I was thinking of two of my friends that used to have thousands of Bitcoins and now the have nearly sold out. The little they have left is not for sale. Maybe there are more guys like that.
@_date: 2014-01-15 10:37:44
Please broaden my horizon 
@_date: 2014-09-22 11:50:18
Is Bitcoin being manipulated the same way as gold and silver ?
@_date: 2014-06-06 06:26:09
Money, not backed by gold and silver (fiat currency) have never lasted. What we see now with the dollar etc is just history repeating itself. Bitcoin is a way to get away from a failing currency.
@_date: 2014-01-15 10:45:20
Thanks for your answer. However on a global scale, 25 Bitcoins is really not that much. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 07:19:25
I like the Hidden Secrets of Money by Mike Maloney, especially episode 4.
It's not about bitcoin but makes the point about fiat currencies.

Just print a paper wallet, it's so easy and safe.

All of those wars you started was all about maintaining the dollars status as reserve and trade currency.
I'm glad to see the dollar fall.
@_date: 2019-06-12 05:26:07
I think Monero is a good investment
@_date: 2019-10-26 07:00:23
That must make us the super smart money
@_date: 2019-06-12 05:22:17
They even started wars to maintain the power of the dollar
@_date: 2019-06-12 05:30:23
They need central banks to finance wars to protect the dollar

Governments have the power to control currencies through central banks. Gold and bitcoin takes that away from them.

In search results for a specific coin, I would also like to see the number position on the market cap.

We're at the end of the fiat monetary cycle. Time to move on to gold and bitcoin. Got nothing to do with Trump,even if media twist it so.

Both Iran and Italy are moving to gold as collateral, going away from fiat and especially the dollar.
@_date: 2019-09-19 10:00:27
When The Fed was created it wasn't supposed to step in at all. Then if there were no buyers on the market, they let the Fed step in order  not to raise the interest rate.
To implemented a cap to the lending at the same time, the debt ceiling. 
And we know how that went...
The system is broken!
@_date: 2019-09-20 14:14:22
Na..  Can't fool me, the system is falling apart. Presently being replaced by the gold trade note used by China Iran Italy etc..

The miners, that still exist at this low price of gold and silver, would go out of business if the price went down more. 
Keep in mind that the price is manipulated to stabilize the dollar. This is done by selling Futures and Derivatives. For every ounce of physical gold there is 500 ounces paper gold.
