Hello! I'm a counselor that works with a small scale non profit and registered charity counseling  service that deals with addictions. [Family enrichment]( has been involved with btc since 2014 and could really use the support from generous donors this year. We subsidize counseling service needs for the local public. Thank you so much for your generosity regardless of your contribution to us.

Thank you so much for doing this. I help run the bitcoin donation fund of a local not for profit counseling service. I have forwarded your link to my executive director so hopefully you'll see our application soon!

But this is from Canada?
@_date: 2014-09-05 12:47:43
I'm perma excited about Bitcoin, but this is just fueling the crap out of that fire for me!
@_date: 2014-09-05 10:57:02
You rock! Thanks a lot!

I feel compelled to disagree if by "normal" you mean the majority. A lot of people still haven't heard of Bitcoin, so I don't see why they would call it fake internet points if they simply don't know about it, or not a whole lot about it. I also only used the "bitcoin" tag on it, which would suggest that the people viewing the album are people interested in Bitcoin whether positively or negatively since the images I posted are pretty bland.

You rock!!! Thank you!!
@_date: 2014-09-05 11:18:42
That's a great idea! Are people able to sign AFTER a transaction has occurred???
@_date: 2014-09-05 18:10:21
You are absolutely right! Bitcoin has been exciting to me since I first heard about it! Take care, my friend!
@_date: 2014-09-05 10:56:45
@_date: 2014-09-05 01:49:58
Thank you for helping! I should have made the address more visible. 
@_date: 2014-09-05 15:34:13

@_date: 2014-09-05 10:54:36
Thank you for your kind words! I'm doing what I can! 
@_date: 2014-09-05 03:07:04
That's what I thought too! The tables had turned!
@_date: 2014-09-07 23:42:15
Awesome! Thank you for the feedback. Will update!
@_date: 2014-09-05 13:52:28
Thank you for your thoughtfulness! I will retrieve it as soon as possible!
@_date: 2014-09-05 10:53:40
That's a good point. I wasn't expecting to receive this many donations and thought of asking for a signed transaction, but I couldn't because I don't know how to do that myself... Do you have any suggestions on another method? 
@_date: 2014-09-05 01:55:47
Thank you SO much for your contribution!!! 
@_date: 2014-09-15 10:09:25
I think it's an eco-friendly tv. :P
@_date: 2014-09-15 12:28:31
The donations you mean?
@_date: 2014-09-15 10:07:45
:) thank you!
@_date: 2014-09-05 01:49:38
You darn skippy it is! So many people have great causes but so little visibility! Even the album I published had someone begrudging the designs we had for our organization...but we'll be doing better, especially with all this support! Thank you for your kind words!
@_date: 2014-09-05 10:55:48
Absolutely! I'll keep folks informed when any BTC is moved! 
@_date: 2014-09-15 10:08:37
I'm going to keep working hard to encourage others to learn more about cryptos, for sure!
@_date: 2014-09-05 14:37:30
Thank you so much!!! Have a great weekend!
@_date: 2014-09-05 12:48:34
Can't please them all I guess :)
@_date: 2014-09-05 11:50:30
@_date: 2014-09-15 14:23:41
Not sure :/
@_date: 2014-09-05 01:50:08
Thank you so much!!!
@_date: 2014-09-05 01:44:02
THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! You folks are all so amazing!!!!
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:26:36
The business is keeping the Bitcoins from the sales. He's a hodler! 
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:22:16
What's wrong with just using bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:35:07
If there's a demand, sure? 
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:13:03
The transaction is using the private key sweep. I'm not sure what child pays is.
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:14:18
Ooooh, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you!!
@_date: 2017-05-12 23:26:30
The fee is already $20, is that not sufficient? I could try it but was wondering what a "high fee" would be?
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:51:11
This is very serious business we're talking.
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:55:17
? The total amounts equals over 1.I'll fix it when i get to a computer. Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:54:13
It was a good thing that the execs trusted my consultation
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:50:49
Thank you so much, friend!
