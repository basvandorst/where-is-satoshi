If two people meet via localbitcoins and trade a large amount of BTC/USD, do they both need to be registered money transmitters? Which one is the customer with respect to KYC?

Fair enough. I almost added that the bitcoin markets may well influenced by a kind of 'manipulation'. But if so, I think it has to be entirely different from what goes on in the silver and gold markets, and not the kind that can keep can go against market forces for prolonged periods of time because the financial mechanisms to do that don't really exist.
At least that is how I see it, but it is not something I know a lot about, so I'd be interested to hear more thoughts on this.

I don't understand how it is valid to compare the market cap of the bitcoin supply with the market cap of a corporation or industry. Also, comparing it with the price of gold or silver seems problematic because they are heavily manipulated markets.

Sure the message is that it is currently vastly overvalued, but not over what it potentially could be in the future, so I'm not sure I would go as far as to say it is *extremely* bearish. In any case, I'm not convinced by John Woo's reasoning. 
But so what? Not everyone's playing an upvote game.

Wow, you seriously didn't put any thought into that comment at all! :-)

Please explain how you arrived at that conclusion.

I've started pronouncing them as EM-bits and MU-bits.

I would have thought there were more cost effective weapons to fight against zombies.
