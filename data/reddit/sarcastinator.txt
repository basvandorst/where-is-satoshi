Either you have to learn a unit by convention or you have to learn a unit with logic behind it and that is already well established in most of the world.
What's the advantage of "bits"? You have to just declare the unit
1 bits is exactly the same as 1 µBTC but micro is based on a well established, well known system. Most people learn that in school.
Bits is just cognitive baggage. It has no advantage over µBTC. It even takes more characters to write, and everyone has to be told what it means.

Do you seriously believe this?
A Java program will stop executing if they encounter programming errors where the state of the application is no longer correct. PHP can encounter obvious bugs in the code, and the program will just continue running. Even what error codes are returned vary from function to function. FALSE is common, but since this is a valid result from a lot of applications it varies (some return null, others return 0).
Practically _never_ will an application stop running unless you add code to do just that. Did encryption fail due to key malfunction? [just keep running with the key initialized to 0!](

It's [this tool](
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:09:40


It doesn't halt - it never starts because PHP isn't capable of properly solving parenthesis like any other sane parser.


False is in many functions documented as "something went wrong" error code. One such example is json_encode which will return false if something and a string if it succeeds. json_decode however returns null if decoding fails (which is stupid, because null is a perfectly valid return type for a json document. You cannot know from return type alone if json_decode fails but the documentation claims this is the case)
Most modern object oriented programming languages today use structured exception handling to process events where the application is left in a state where it cannot continue without a faulty result. C uses the more dreaded, but necessary GetLastError pattern. PHP enforces no kind of error handling, and what is used to indicate an error depends on the API function.


Oh really! Unless you think that [wrong operator precedence]( makes sense, you are wrong. The ternary, unless you push it full of parenthesis', will not yield the expected result.


That a dynamic language is also loosely typed, and not just a little bit, is an abomination. The equality table of PHP is laughable due to its inconsistencies. Such as "foo" == true, "foo" == 0 but true is obviously not 0.


Then why is there a [virtual machine implementation in the zend source code?]( Also, PHP runs PHP byte code (which is stupidly just pushed out during parsing without any lexical or expression tree produced) in the de-facto standard implementation. It must necessarily have a virtual machine implementation of some kind or it wouldn't be able to hold application state.


You clearly did not understand the point. Programming languages are tools. They should minimize risk by requiring that statements are clearly expressed.


I think having a dynamic language that also enforces such loose typing is a really bad idea.


You can try to apply that hypothesis of yours to other languages and see how many fails your test. I have written parsers and this is seriously 101.

I think they may have moved a lot of their code base to pure C++ as well. Andrei Alexandrescu posted source for [a C++ linter he wrote in D]( for internal use (to me implying that they have a pure C++ code base as well).
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:53:20
You want to laugh? How about this:
PHP 5.5 added a "feature" called dereferencing
Pre 5.5 this didn't work:
    echo array(1, 2, 3)[0];
Why? The parser failed. It didn't understand such a simple expression. So they fixed it. How can you break it today though? Just add parenthesis.
    echo (array(1, 2, 3))[0];
Now you can slap your thigh in amusement.
@_date: 2014-03-03 13:27:32
Any programming error is a potential security risk. The erroneous implementation of the ternary operator, or that equality does not mean identity are security risks. This is demonstrated by the fact that [strcmp doesn't actually document what happens if an argument is not a string]( but the result is that if you don't use the identity operator, [you may have a security hole in your implementation](
Of course you can always blame programming errors on the developers, but programming languages are made for humans, and therefore should minimize risk.
This is why I also think actually SQL also is a poorly designed language. Take the DELETE syntax. It has the following form (i think everybody know this, but for clarity)
    DELETE FROM Table WHERE Foo = Bar
What happens if you miss the WHERE clause? Most jobs that deal with SQL has a horror story of an old employee that managed to forget the WHERE clause in production. This of course is partly to blame on the developer, but couldn't SQL say it like this instead
    FROM Table WHERE Foo = Bar DELETE
Maybe even require the where clause? This would prevent this type of error from happening. We must expect that humans err, therefor we should make tools that doesn't continue when the application is in an invalid state, or that has a syntax which allows human errors.
For the same reason I think using = as assignment in all C languages is also a bad design decision. This is most notable in C and C++ where Yoda typing is common to avoid the issue. C# and Java has it partially solved by not allowing integers to implicitly cast to bool, and D where assignments are illegal in conditional blocks. The more obvious solution would be to use another token for assignment, such as left arrow.
One thing PHP is that it tries to mimick C at some points (such as the standard library) but Perl on others. It fails to do anything consistently and ends up being a poor programming language that is only so popular because it is so easy to get something running. The end result is that most (not all) PHP programmers are inexperienced, numerous and cheap. This results in stuff like this where a major exchange was written in a programming language that does not enforce correctness in any way.

This was related to the web browser plug-in for the most part. And these were vulnerabilities in parts of the run-time, not the programming language. No one had to change coding practices when these bugs were discovered.


[Argument from authority](


C was designed in the 80's to fit the processor architecture close (which is why the datatype sizes has such fuzzy descriptions and pointers are a big deal). PHP on the other hand is a garbage collected high level programming language running in a virtual machine. It is completely different.
In any case I think it is quite safe to blame a badly designed programming language for being badly designed. Do you know why the naming conventions in PHP are so weird? It's because PHP 1.0 used strlen as a hashing algorithm, so in order to create a flat distribution, the function names were just altered to match some length to give a more fair distribution.

Key points:- Adding workload does not mitigate effects. On the contrary it makes it easier to obtain the required signal.- Older computers are easier to attack due to worn capacitors.- There are a lot of variables, but the attack is plausible across computers. Microphone placement is important.- GnuPGP is partially fixed as of the release of the article.- An attack vector presented is also to use it in malware to circumvent virtual machine protection.GnuPGP was used to present the attack.
