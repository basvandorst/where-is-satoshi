that is not exactly a global representative sample. Alexa users could be skewed to USA.

I can do it again, can't I?

I am going to start a cryptocurrency that has a max limit of 1 coin. Then it will be equivalent to 165,000 metric tons of gold! So scarce!

when its lower!

It's quite simple. You sell goods or labor in exchange for bitcoin

Sell to people in other countries

Yes the courts don't care if it's encrypted. It's property and they will just tally up the value and split it. If you don't give up the coins, they will just take the extra value from a different asset

People have been saying that about gold for centuries

US government confiscated gold not more than 50 years ago.

No they all dropped it because the txs were not confirming for a very long time and it was a bad user experience. They explicitly said this was the reason.

That is interesting. It may spur a competition between miners to bounce back and forth between networks trying to get the most profit from their asics. Sort of like arbitrage in other currency markets. 
Also, If there was a network that was taken over by one miner, consumers would lose faith in that currency, and price would go down. Sort of like a self-regulating phenomenon in which a miner would be incentivized to never ruin a currency by controlling 51%. Or conversely, a bunch of 'evil' miners attempting to get 51% of a network and nobody ever being able to do it due to competition.

At some price point, miners are going to look at the price per coin and compare that to the cost/risk of starting a new network with the same features (a clone). The reward for being an early miner in a new network would be huge and at some point the attraction would be too great to resist. The 21mil limit is not a limit if many networks can spring up. Just like people are gambling on the price of bitcoin today, miners could gamble on new networks. Especially if there is not much money to be made in a crowded, established network.
I could imagine a large miner trying to start their own clone network, and perhaps gaining some traction. When there is traction, other miners see the potential for reward and jump into that network in an attempt to get profit and at the same time strengthening that network and maybe even overpowering the originator in terms of control. This would just continue until there were many solid networks and low scarcity.
