The most important thing for these down trend in price times is to increase adoption/usage.  It needs to be easy for people to **USE**.  Everyone WILL NOT understand it but EVERYONE can use it.  EVEN PPL WHO TYPE IN ALL CAPS.

You definitely "CAN".
Sending BTC to Mars or to the moon or ISS is definitely doable.
But hypothetically if there were space stations all around the solarsystem, the whole system would definitely slow down now that I think about it.

Either he's dumb, lazy about actually thinking through/reading up on them, didn't buy as much as he hoped, Or the world's richest is afraid of others getting rich.
I saw a video of him earlier this year praising btc and saying it's rise was inevitable.  Maybe more powerfull actors got to him to encourage him to spread fud.

Eventually the huge corrections will stop once btc is massively adopted.  It'll be a while though

These numbers don't mention that the "total value of all the money/wealth in the world" will keep going up.  1 btc might be hypothetically worth 10 million of today's USD. 1 btc will be worth who knows how much of 5 years from now's USD

You can't explain that

She has to stay neutral in most topics.  She didn't do this to help/hurt btc.  She did this because its a hot topic and saying something about it helps her show.  It does help btc because it widens the # of ppl who have heard of it and can now look up more if they want to know about it.

There are soon to be way more millionares because of the added supply.  It's inevitable.
