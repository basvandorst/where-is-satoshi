We don't have a quote from VISA / MasterCard themselves as we did not deal with them directly. We accepted their cards through eWire who sent the following message to us this morning:
*"We have been contacted by our payment provider regarding Bitcoin Nordic. We have been required by VISA and Mastercard to shut down your payment solution because of a large risk of chargebacks in this business. 
I am therefore forced to shut down your cooperation with Ewire. It is very unfortunate that this duopoly can force their requirements in this manner but we need to consider our entire business when we get a message like this because we can lose our payment service if we do not comply."* 
(My translation from Danish)
In the past two months since we started accepting card payments we have processed approximately $50,000 in credit card payments. To my knowledge there has only been one case of chargeback for about $200 and we covered this case out of our own pockets. Actually, this case didn't even involve a VISA or MasterCard but a DanKort.

I know nothing about Diablo 3, but am I not correct that:
* 1000K gold normally costs $2.39 ( [source]( and [source]( )
* Current MtGox rate is $6.7, so 2.39/6.7 = 0.357 BTC/Mgold
* You're profit is ((0.357 - 0.239) / 0.357) * 100 = 33.05% ?

To make Bitcoin more used for microdonations, how about making an option that allows the user to pay a bitcoin address a fixed amount simply by double clicking a bitcoin address?
This should be optimized for micro payments, so there should be no confirmation dialog or ability to set amount after double clicking.
The transaction should either proceed immediately, or be scheduled to complete in 5 minutes - until which the user could delete the scheduled transaction in the interface.
I imagine this could be useful for tipping posts across Reddit, BitcoinTalk, forums, etc.

@_date: 2012-07-21 00:58:42
I'm an avid user of  which shows the definition of words you double click. Does that also work by JS injection or does it show there is another method?
I must say my favorite is still the idea of a double click and that's the end of it. I mean, I could see myself using the plugin for just this and nothing else. I'd keep using the standard Bitcoin client for normal payments, and I'd only keep a few Bitcoins in the Chrome wallet for tips.
My second choice would be for the double click to bring up a "Send payment" dialog box where the default amount would be a tip. This dialog box could then also have buttons to "Add to address book" and such, but pressing Enter immediately after double clicking would send the standard tip. I think this would accomplish the same speed and simplicity as your &lt;t&gt;-suggestion but with the added flexibility of being able to change the payment amount.
The Reddit-feature sounds very cool. As a user I wouldn't worry too much about getting my coins stolen as I would only store a small amount in the Chrome wallet.

I don't want to to get into a political debate here, but two things:
1. One could, possibly, imagine a state designed in such a way as to not give special privileges to corporations.
2. There's a large pool of research and litterature on "anarcho capitalism", "market anarchism", or similar terms, that deals with the theory, practicality, and even historical examples of property rights without a monopolistic legal system.

QuickBitcoins is still featuring a design which is a total ripoff of our website, 
The theme is a public template, but the content is almost exactly the same too. 
At the moment we're serving two different markets, so I'm not saying this to harm a competitor. But who on earth running a serious business would copy the website of someone else in the same industry?
Furthermore, QuickBitcoins is even lying in the above announcement: *"No other bitcoin service provider on the planet is currently accepting PayPal or credit cards."*
As QuickBitcoins has already publicly admitted to taking the website design from us, they clearly know about our service. So they also know that they are not the only ones on the planet selling Bitcoins for credit cards.
What a severe lack of professionalism.

We figured out the fee system of our bank. Any EUR transaction from within the EEA (European Economic Area) will only have a €1.40 fee. A EUR transaction from outside EEA will have a fee of €5.40.
Switzerland is, unfortunately in your case, not in the EEA so the €5.40 fee applies.
We expect to be ready to accept transfers to our German bank account within a couple of weeks. This will allow us to accept EUR transfers from EEA countries with no fee. I'll look into what Switzerland and other non-EEA countries will pay to the German account.

It's interesting how you see Bitcoin as a tool to fight capitalism whereas I see Bitcoin as a tool to secure capitalism from government interference.
Does this discrepancy stem from two different understandings of what constitutes capitalism? 
Do you understand capitalism as the system of unholy alliances between large corporations and the government, making the government and central banks pass legislation to please the narrow interests of these corporations? This is a system which I would normally call corporatism.
Whereas I understand capitalism as free markets - i.e. where government plays no role, doesn't give out favors to market actors, and doesn't issue it's own money of which it can inflate supply every year.

"You can think of Bitcoins as special e-mails that cannot be copied. When you forward the e-mail you lose your own copy of it. And because there's a hard limit on the amount of these special e-mails, people have started valuing them."
Technically very inaccurate but it's easy to understand if you know e-mail and for the end user experience of Bitcoin it is not too inaccurate.

You make it sound like you were not aware of the rip-off to blame it on the designer. But actually you said on BitcoinTalk that you thought we wouldn't mind because we were in different markets. So you *were* aware of the rip-off and didn't care until we called you on it.
[I quote:]( *"I admit, your site did give us some inspiration for our design. I figured since you only serve the Nordic community and we're more geared toward the North American market there would be very few overlap issues with our visitor base.

There are both investment costs and running costs (electricity). You may still be making back your electricity costs, but only be making little progress towards making back your investment costs. So you're still better off mining.
@_date: 2011-10-24 05:47:54
I agree this is the main mechanism. But I suspect a smaller factor is that as difficulty increases, miners are hesitant to sell their Bitcoins below the cost of mining them, thus driving up price.

Re: B2C Transactions
1. It's legal in China to buy and sell bitcoins for RMB.
2. It's legal in China to buy and sell other goods for RMB.
1+2 = To effectively sell a good for bitcoins in China, you can use a payment gateway similar to Bitpay, where they receive bitcoins and you (the merchant) receives RMB. Then you've sold goods for RMB, and the payment gateway company has bought bitcoins for RMB. Both of which are legal.

I can't get my head around how to run an ATM and avoid abuse.
I've done cash trades in BTC earlier, and there's quite a market out there for large cash transactions. As in 20k USD and up.
I don't see how to limit customers in the amounts they purchase without enforcing a hard limit for all customers using that one ATM, which would hurt other smaller customers.

The Bitcoin economy is moving in two directions at the same time. One direction is for the AML and general regulatory compliant digital currency interfacing with the traditional financial systems. The other direction is the anonymous cryptocurrency with a completely new surrounding cryptoeconomy. Both economies will thrive and be mutually beneficial to each other.

No, I'm pretty sure those things are not included either. See page 15: 
That chart is almost 10 years old, but neither "Ledighed", "Helbred, sociale problemer", nor "Tidlig tilbagetrækning" could cover flextidsjob or praktik. And I don't think "Midlertidigt fravær" would cover that either. Even if it does, it's a really small part of the 800.000-900.000.
Another chart on page 6 here doesn't show flextidsjob or praktik either, but it shows what else is considered an "overførselsindkomst":

Average distance between Mars and Earth is about 225( 10^6 ) km. Speed of light is 300( 10^3 ) km/s. So a transaction from Mars would take about 750 seconds or 12.5 minutes to reach earth.
I guess we would get quite a few loose blockchain ends. Maybe some quantum entanglement is the solution.

No, this is not run by or endorsed by Danske Bank, and there is no buy/sell functionality on the site yet. In fact, Danske Bank explicitly forbids commercial use of the Mobile Pay app. One of the measures they have in place for this is that they limit each account to only being able to receive a maximum of 18k DKK per year, which makes it impossible to use for Bitcoin selling on any significant scale. Also, you fund your Mobile Pay account with credit cards, so selling BTC this way will burn you or get you banned by Danske Bank.

There were people from the national bank of Denmark, ministry of defense, TDC (largest tele-company here), Nets (credit card processor), Nykredit (bank) and Saxo Bank, among a few others. No leaders (I think), but employees.
I introduced Bitcoin, its current use cases (payments, investment, money transfer), its potential societal implications (less private banking, less inflation of monetary supply), and spent a few minutes on its technical workings.
They had a lot of questions - more than an hour. A lot of time was spent discussing Bitcoin security. Less time was spent discussing controversial stuff like money laundering, which I thought was good.

I see it like this: Colored coins will still be coins. So if a colored coin also is 1 satoshi, it will always still be one satoshi. It will just be something else in addition to one satoshi as well.
So at any point, you can choose to sell the coin for its value as a piece of whatever asset the color represents, OR you will always be able to sell it as just one satoshi.
