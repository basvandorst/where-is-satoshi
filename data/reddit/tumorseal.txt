As of right now I have .046 bitcoins and am stoked.  I can't imagine the feelings of people that have a real amount.

If this is true then that is amazing man. A reward for serving our country.  
It also makes me wish I had more then .45 bitcoins. Lol.

Bitcointip is how I got started. Actually to be honest it is where I still am. Someone gave me a couple of bitcents a couple of weeks ago and now I am trying to mine. I don't know if I will ever get enough to make any money, but the whole situation is just amazing to me and I am having fun.
Just pulled up my wallet. I am the proud owner of .02247852 bitcoins.
AWW YEAH :)

I am going to do that when I get home just to feel awesome.

That is what happened to me.  Ignored bitcoin for years until someone gave me .02 bitcoins lol.

As a noob to this whole thing the file on my comp is worth about 12 dollars :).  Somehow I am still excited.

Can someone make a bitcoin meme subreddit so this stuff has its own place?

Seriously, it means a lot, and I hope to be able to pass it forward someday.

I have no way to help you besides happily being one of your customers when you launch.

That is me.  I never really looked into the whole thing.  Now I am looking into mining and am the proud owner of 2 bitcents. 
I am oddly excited about all of this.
