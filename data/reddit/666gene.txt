The price is one of least interesting thing in Bitcoin if you ask me. Nothing is like Bitcoin it really is a unique Crypto Currency.

I'm not trying to be patronizing but if you have to ask you still need to do research on sound money to understand what Bitcoin is.

Its frustrating. because for me its not all about the price. But price is the only thing i can use to get them interested. The technology is so much deeper but the only way to get interest from most people is through the price. I still mention it now and then but iv eased back and played it safer this year lol.

And you think this ban is gonna stop drug dealers using cash?

Id like to also mention that in Feb2018 a law was passed in regards to Bank Bail-ins. This along with hints of negative interest rates leave majority of law abiding citizens vulnerable to financial instability in the banks. This law will exclude criminals as they will continue to use cash. People like  [eqleriq]( &amp;  [tapunan]( are the type of people that want Communism in Australia and have no grasp of what self sovereignty is. If you had a moral compass you would see the moral implications of this bill and the one passed in Feb. My question to you is. Where would you put your money during negative interest rates if you cant hold it in cash? and who said it would end at 10kAUD?

because if i run my node i know what bitcoin is. This is why everyone should validate their own transactions (hence running your own node.)
@_date: 2019-05-19 09:18:10
 Because your right you could spin up 10000 nodes on google cloud but they are validating nothing.
@_date: 2019-05-19 08:52:11


No because miners would need to be running the same node as you right? if your not running the same consensus as the miners your transactions wont be validated?

Im not quite sure i understand. I guess one aspect (as a whole) would be, more full nodes means more Finality? The more full nodes the more decentralized. Less of a single entity threat?
@_date: 2018-12-10 04:48:50
imagine though if there was competition for emergency services. I feel that could have a positive effect in some aspects.
