Only twice here, once to open it to imgur, and then again to zoom in. :/

So they are complaining a way that has been used by a few open source companies to make money(and has been proven to work)?
ie: ftp://ftp.redhat.com/redhat/linux/enterprise/7Server/en/os/  (yes yes with this you also get support but the idea is kinda the same, you pay to use their binaries or you can rebuild it yourself)

How do you know they are not running

Looks more like Hughes...  (really, mouse over the ? next to Data Allowance)

That is because it is our turn to be the nationalist assholes of the world.. or at least I think it is.
@_date: 2014-07-14 05:45:45
What if Coin Fire, CoinDesk, and The Crypto Crimson paid him to write a story about them.

What makes this better then Andreas Schildbach  wallet?

Any, I was merely pointing out the fact that we have no idea what userland they run on their servers. Like I am pretty sure Google has stripped out most of the GNU userland in favor of their own in-house version(Not 100% sure, but it would not surprise me either way).
@_date: 2014-05-05 05:42:46
give it time... or i could start a revolt in your name.

What if you are the last human on this site and you don't even know it?
@_date: 2014-06-27 19:45:27
AT&amp;T did that with me, what I ended up doing was just using westernunion online.

Also the number of commits could be faked. which leads to cool things like screwing with github's commit counter

Lets not forget that if someone can tie a wallet id to you they can track your purchases.
@_date: 2015-11-23 20:45:23
Dude, that is in reference to software, and AGPL does not protect users. IE their data they put in on a site can still be sold.
I am a strong supporter for FOSS but "If a service is free, then you are the product" is in no way ment to belittle Free Open Source Software. Hell, the biggest offenders of selling peoples digital lives are all backed by FOSS.

Have you checked grubhub?
@_date: 2015-03-28 06:18:20
I will just leave this here: 
@_date: 2015-02-22 08:08:39
There are other places that are worth serving other then the US? TIL. :D
@_date: 2015-02-22 08:10:53
As a user of stuff like  and  I would totally use a service like this.

:( When I bought my first bitcoin, I paid 4USD. I sold it when it hit 50USD. Never sale, you will always have sellers regret within the next year.
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:01:41
They had no problem taking my money: 
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:37:21
Please look at the dates in the images.
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:40:03
I did, and I started this transaction 2 months before any of that came out. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 19:38:43
Any reply yet? I am going to guess no. 
This is what I was talking about, not a peep from them when someone tries to get a hold of them. Hence me trying to warn people about them.
Yes some may have a good experience and not need to contact them but that is not always the case. For those times it is a mess.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:53:56
and on top of that overwriting data a couple of times people can still recover it.
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:05:18
They unlocked it. So I was able to get them out. *edits OP*
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:21:15
Here is a "cleaned" up copy that can scan it 
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:26:06
Well they finally got around to replying to my tickets.
"Your block might have lifted till now. Please try again tranfering now.
Please try to avoid multiple tickets for the same issue for rapid resoluion of your ticket."
*shrugs* 
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:46:41
Honestly I don't give a shit about the 50$(well now 100$), I care more about the 3 unack'd support tickets I have submitted about this and have not heard so much a peep from them.
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:23:59
Not on campbx, I am verified on Dwolla. I was just testing the waters with them which they state "KYC verification is not required if you transfer less than $1,000 per day in/out of your CampBX account" and there is nothing here  about holding an account locked if you are not verified.

It is still too early for me. I need some caffeine.
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:42:09
As long as the mic stays uncovered I am good.
@_date: 2013-12-21 22:42:24
Seems they have published the source
