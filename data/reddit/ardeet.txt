I don't want to panic you or unnecessarily jump to *too many* conclusions but with that amount of bitcoins proven to be stolen the owners of NewsBTC are now undoubtedly ISIS!

Despite the opinions about Kim Dotcom, the exciting part about getting this concept out there is what it can trigger in the minds of other people.
If it inspires someone to compete with this idea and actually build an encrypted network which is readily accessible to the average bods and sods like me, then I happy to see the idea touted publicly.

Another Australian here with a different take.
For all the myths out there there has been a toxic creep of unquestioning acceptance of authority in Australia. In the same way that the country serves as a test bed for technology it also serves as a test bed for repression.
Larrikinism, sarcasm and dryness has been hijacked or co-opted into servants of fear and compliance.
It's been like catching your once cool Aunt walk out of a confessional in a pants suit.

That was the actual title of the podcast. I didn't want to editorialise the title.
He certainly can talk in some broad brush strokes however I don't think that should cloud the message, which I happen to think is very practical. 
It's also in line with the advice that a number of bitcoin traders (by no means all) give here in r/bitcoin. 
I don't agree that it is a straw man because he is addressing a reality and in my experience a mindset that is often ridiculed in here.

**tl;dr** Using encryption means you support apartheid and child pornography. If you don't trust law enforcement with your privacy then your family will be murdered.

Thank Her Noodliness that organisations like this aren't involve with managing the fiscal and monetary systems of entire nations. /s
