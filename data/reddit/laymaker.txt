I don't see any special benefit here. There are an amazing number of banks with different account types. Accounts are so competitive that you often get free money just for signing up. I don't think you would be able to gain even an extra $100 over the course of your entire life by spending countless hours specializing each of your transactions for the sake of specification.
Don't you see how this is just a more complicated way of achieving the same thing that's already covered by banks? 
The banks' costs of administering/facilitating billing for automated subscriptions are tied to the amount of these transactions that occur among account holders. If a wallet provider has a bunch of wallet holders who each end up with the same number of transactions that require this type of service/facilitation,  their costs for that will be comparable as they are providing the same administration, technical support, protection coverage, pull mechanism etc. It just means that users now have to spend time tediously electing features for each transaction. The same dynamics hold true for other types of transactions such as those that require escrow services. Now you just have a more complicated account (or series of accounts as I described them in my earlier post) that requires more from the user to accomplish the same thing. Actually the bank system seems slightly better because it really makes little sense for the user to constantly guess which transactions should be done under different levels of protection. 
Simplified: 
1. Bank: account holder has one consolidated account. Transactions are all automatically protected, eligible for automated/subscription billing, stored securely for saving, etc. The cost structure of the bank is tied to the number of transactions that utilize each feature. 
2. Wallet Provider: wallet holder has multiple accounts or one account with multiple distinct compartments. They muse predict and select which features they want for each and every transaction. The coat structure of the wallet provider is tied to the number of transactions that utilize each feature.

What are you talking about? No matter what happens with "shares", a leveraged owner who has borrowed money will have some schedule for repaying debt. This gives him more risk and less flexibility as compared to an owner with all of the same characteristics with the exception of an extra 100m in capital. Finance 101. You make no sense and no good points. I "encourage you" to keep your mouth shut when you have no idea what you're talking about

If I'm really oblivious it would be helpful to have the following compared:
1. Overhead for a bank account behind a transaction related to an automated subscription bill that pulls from the account and has fraud protection via escrow agents and follow financial regulations.
2. Overhead from the same type of transaction via a bitcoin wallet that, in it's mainstream stage, will also have to follow financial regulations.
The only difference I see is that the bitcoin transaction will also include fees to cover a miner reward.


Because it's true. The bank hasn't set up an arbitrarily difficult problem to be solved by a network of miners every time a transaction needs to be made...
@_date: 2014-12-24 21:41:45
If someone hacks my bank account I wouldn't even think about it that night while I slept. The bank would make me whole. If I made a transaction and decided after receiving the product that it had been fraudulently presented, my bank would make me whole. Do you think multisignature escrow is simple enough for the common consumer, and do you think it provides the same scope of protection that my bank does?
I wonder what fraud protection the banks in Sweden do offer. I know the American users of this sub are extremely disingenuous when they marginalize what our banks offer.
@_date: 2014-12-26 04:00:52
I don't buy it. If my wallet's standard settings are the same coverage w. fraud protection, a pull mechanism for allowing automated subscription payments, etc. then I have essentially replicated a bank and we have to start comparing fees only (the "trustless, private, be-your-own-bank" unique parts of bitcoin are out of the equation at that point).
You're saying that the *fees* would end up being lower. And you're saying that's because the cryptocurrency manages itself whereas the bank uses manual labor for transactions... but the bank doesn't actually do any manual labor when I sign up for a magazine subscription and get billed. And both fiat and bitcoin require an escrow agent for escrow protection. Actually bitcoin has way higher inherent transaction fees (especially in the future) because miners must be paid for each transaction.

It's not. You're a fool. "Passing the buck" applies to formal logic,  not to cash flows.

Those costs only go away if your bitcoin account doesn't have any of the services.... There aren't many people clamoring for less services based on the extremely small fees that come from banks. I was editing my comment to add more if you want to take a look, sorry about that but I'm on a phone. It seems that you just end up looking for the same services with bitcoin but you spend an enormous amount of time spreading them out instead of consolidating them with one account. And what are the chances of a seller keeping money in an escrow account for 6 months?

There was no logic in that post. The idea that if both businesses go bankrupt, they both lose 100m is not relevant to whether one business has an advantage. One business has an advantage because they have no obligatory cash flow to financing charges within a period defined by a bank so they can undercut the competitor as they have more flexibility during this  (within the scope of our conversation) and for a million other reasons (within a larger scope).

MySpace is a good example when you use it to show that having people heavily invested in something doesn't mean it will never be replaced. Including the example of email helps demonstrate that there are much larger factors at play, as you are pointing out now, which is exactly my point. Your original comment about people being heavily invested in bitcoin is meaningless in terms of understanding whether bitcoin will be replaced. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 03:25:38
You're just wrong. There is nothing forcing the man with 100m to make more than 5%... Defeating a competitor may have a much greater benefit than the 'opportunity cost' you described. It may even just match the goals/profile/horizon of the man with 100m better than any other investment option. This is really basic. Whether defeating the competitor ends in a monopoly or just a market with one less competitor is irrelevant. The man with 100m has at least one more option/advantage than the man without 100m and this entirely satisfies your challenge to name an advantage. It's very, very basic.

No... but obviously even if they have the same rate there is an advantage because the owner with capital will not have to borrow the money and thus has more flexible control over his cash flows.  He does not have a predetermined schedule of repayment that constrains his plans. Did you even read what I wrote? Shares have nothing to do with anything... even if we decided they were relevant,  the man with capital also has shares *and* he still has his capital...
You are the most tiresome fool I have ever heard speak on this subject
@_date: 2014-12-23 06:26:39
This is a discussion of the advantages of capital, not "having extra money". I already provided one example -- a man starting a business with $100m would have more flexibility while the leveraged competitor has strict obligations against their cash flows. Thus, the non-leveraged owner can accept a smaller margin and undercut the leveraged competitor during this time, or use the money for r&amp;d during this time, or any other number of advantageous uses. You are inflating your lack of logic to extreme proportions and it's cringeworthy. You've gone to the point of focusing the argument on the fact that I haven't been formal.

And I don't know if it's fair to compare pounds to bitcoin... I thought bitcoin was supposed to be the currency of the future for seamlessly transacting over the internet. Is it really so impossible to use it for its main purpose that Microsoft would rather pay a high processing fee to a 3rd party? If Microsoft has to do this and isn't saving any processing fees, do you think this really qualifies as a genuine use of Bitcoin technology or does this just end up as a system for transactions that arbitrarily includes bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-12-23 06:03:57
You have no coherent argument. Really. 


I lol'd. Way to inflate the most basic point as you head nowhere.


Umm yes it does...


This is truly tiresome. If you take two people who are only separated by the fact that one controls more capital (say, $1000), then they both also have the ability to get other financing and the one with the capital will still have an advantage on top of this parity in available financing... This is the exact context of our argument and you have had zero good logic from the beginning on this point. That's without even going into the details of how existing capital factors into each party's ability to raise more capital.
Again, you have no argument to respond to. You have just been restating the same asinine nonsense. Your emphasis on argumentation is very silly.
@_date: 2014-12-28 05:54:00

Actually you just mentioned part of it, you did not address the logic at all. Two people put 100m into a business and one pays 5% in financing charges -- it does not follow that the business without financing charges needs to make 5% more profit for any reason. The unleveraged owner can undercut the competitor (who has 5% higher costs) and then have a monopoly after driving that competitor out of business. You didn't address anything in your nonsensical 'explanation' and your thoughts on capital are just... Yikes

How about instead of paying $10 extra for the chip in my phone and $5/month extra for electricity I just cut out 21inc and pay Walmart $1/month for a 15% discount membership, since in your scenario Walmart is offering such a ludicrous proposition?

I'm not your babysitter and I already spent years of my life working on and regurgitating basic economics in an academic setting -- I don't feel that you sincerely need me to do that. If you're really interested you can look up the advantages of capital or the dynamics of competition/consolidation/monopolistic pricing and there is plenty of good reading. It's a little cringeworthy that you actually thought there is no business advantage to having capital, and your posturing now is even more cringeworthy.
That said, if you write out your entire understanding of monopolies and the advantages of capital, including examples and a little history along with your sources, I will explain the advantages of capital in greater detail in exchange.

Of course I don't hope they go out of business either, as life is harsh enough and they are just enthusiastic,  hard-working guys. It would be nice if they or this community were realistic and acknowledged that it's impossible to run a remittance service without some form of fees and this company will be a smaller Western Union clone that arbitrarily uses bitcoin.

Bitcoin has no implications for taxes as compared to fiat, as the op agrees later in this thread. No, you wouldn't get to choose where your taxes go. Taxes would remain the same.
1) bitcoin has no implications for reporting assets and income (your employer still has the same incentives to accurately report what they and you make, only the same small businesses like liquor stores and smoke shops would try to understate earnings and this is actually easier with cash than with bitcoin).
2) bitcoin has no implications for the government collecting what you owe. They would still be able to garnish your wages, so it would still be a pull mechanism, and they would still be able to go after your house and other assets and put you in jail.
@_date: 2015-01-12 16:26:59
Thanks for at least making a statement. 


This doesn't make sense to me. Western Union doesn't charge a fee because just because moving dollars is difficult -- they charge a fee to pay for marketing, security, locations, technical support, staff, all kinds of other overhead and of course *to make a profit*. Are you not paying your staff? Will you not have any physical locations for por people to easily pick up their money? Is your security budget zero? Are you not trying to make a profit? 
@_date: 2015-01-12 09:20:29
So you agree that bitcoin has no real implications related to taxes? What was the point of your op again?
You obviously have no experience with taxes. If you end up owing taxes the government sends a letter to your employer and your employer sits you down and explains that you will not be receiving a fraction of your paychecks until the debt is paid. This would not change with bitcoin... I'm assuming your explanation is playing well with other teenagers but you should ask whoever is in charge of payroll at your work.
In terms of contractors not paying their taxes -- how is this different than with cash? Again, the government will just take you to court and take your assets or convict you.
@_date: 2015-01-04 06:19:28

This seems like the real plan. Eventually they will have to charge, and, along with all of the other friction involved with cashing in and out of bitcoin and paying transaction fees, this service will eventually be either more expensive or a direct clone of Western Union with fewer branches.
I don't want us to put words in his mouth so I wish he would just answer the question. It's very basic.

No, they don't. 


Among other things, I have a degree in Finance. Your laughable lack of a point isn't teaching me anything. As I said before, the owner who is fully capitalized has no obligations against his cash flows and therefore has an advantage in terms of flexibility. You have no counter-argument,  just a lot of hand-waving and an idiotic patronizing tone


Yeah,  whatever. Go down to your nearest university, walk into the finance department and ask for help with a quick problem.

Speaking from experience, it really IS that easy in my case at one of the largest banks in the United States.
What you described uses an escrow agent, which would yield the same cost structure faced by the banks, and remove the trustless promise of bitcoin. And once the transaction is through the escrow/processing stage nothing can be done. This seems to have all the problems of the bank system with fewer benefits, and seems to only arbitrarily include bitcoin technology.
Are bitcoin users supposed to have multiple be-your-own-bank accounts?
1. Automatically billed account -- fees and a pull mechanism to allow automatic subscriptions, not trustless
2. Vendor transaction account -- fees and a protection system based on escrow agents, not trustless
3. Cold storage account -- hardware costs and an enormous amount of inconvenience and still relatively high risk to maintain savings, not trustless
4. Real bitcoin account -- fees such as exchange and transaction fees and no protection, to be used for illegal "private, trustless" transactions
Wouldn't it make more sense for them to have one real bank account with real money for their real life and one bitcoin account with &gt;$100 for buying drugs whenever they want to break federal law via a traceable system with honeypots everywhere instead of going down the street to buy pot with cash like a normal human being?

That doesn't make sense either. 
1) If they can really generate a profit simply by selling bitcoins in the Philippines, the source of their profits in completely unrelated to remittances. Performing remittances is just a complicated addition with no benefit. 
2) If there is a true arbitrage opportunity in selling bitcoins overseas that is not washed by the transaction costs, other firms will take advantage of this and the opportunity will close, making this a short-term-only source of profit.

Such a fantasy. First of all, what does that even have to do with bitcoin? If a company is going to make so much money off you by having your personal information, why wouldn't normal payment processors using fiat be able to complete (they have the same data and the rest of the equation detailed by still holds, giving fiat payments an unchanged advantage)?
Secondly, how many companies are going to give you 5%off in exchange for your personal information? If they make that much off of your personal information, why wouldn't they make this same offer to fiat processors/customers? Are you telling me I could collect the data on where I spent money in the last year and some company out there would want to pay $1500 for that?

What are you talking about? Buttcoin had a realistic discussion of bitpay's numbers that you can't find in this forum. For god's sake 80% of bitcoin purchases were on mining equipment and expenses! It's just like one of those giant energy drink/jewelry/supplement MLM schemes where all of the recruits/victims are constantly having to invest more into their profitless venture. No real value is being exchanged or created and bitpay's numbers are absolutely horrible. The only possible "bright side" for bitcoin is that there may be an existing 'use case' that isn't represented in bitpay's numbers: child porn, drugs, money laundering and ransomware. Bitpay wouldn't have that data. This is all highly relevant to MasterCard's decision and I gave several other lines of reasoning that could have supported the decision as well. Get over it.
The discussion of bitpay's numbers on "there were more transactions than last year so it must be more of a currency than an investment now!" I kid you not, this was the mainstream view in this forum. How can I cite this discussion productively?

Firstly Bruce, I'm really looking forward to your tenure.  Forget substitutes,  what if I told you that you actually don't have to dress up your points with *any* buzzword!?
"Companies in the bitcoin space" = bitcoin companies
"I really think the bitcoin space will revolutionize..." = bitcoin will revolutionize or bitcoiners will revolutionize
Try to imitate people talking about real breakthroughs like driverless cars or cell phones. Notice that nobody would consistently append "space" to these because there isn't any desperate psychological need to dress up these technologies. Right now the word is just thrown into every bitcoin comment because bitcoiners love masterbating to their own overblown "insights" like they're headlining a TedX event at every moment. It comes off like an author using Latinates in their written dialogue for a talking dog. A lot of this has to do with the type of people who are attracted to bitcoin in the first place. 
There are, of course, normal words for when you are trying to specifically refer to an industry or "ecosystem" (sigh). It's just that to bitcoiners:
"industry" = rust belt old folks grown up

I would have to go out of my way to spend bitcoin, it doesn't solve any problems, 95% of users have lost 25%+ on their "investment", it does not act as a store of value, you pay a premium to use it, the ease of use is pathetic, security problems abound, no supply chains use it for trade, no major employers use it for wages, no major financial institutions use it for settlement, no countries use it as a state-favored currency, little fads like tipping have died, major cities have single-digit numbers of establishments that accept it (less than the number that would accept arcade tokens)  and the whole community is generally relying on a foundation of buying specialty drugs through the mail...

Couldn't you just take a video of yourself accessing the account and checking the balance? You could even record a simultaneous phone call to the bank checking the balance at the same time.
No simple method with bitcoin or dollars can accomplish the trustless verification of account funds and their integrity. A screenshot or video of a bank account being accessed has problems but is no more flawed than a signed bitcoin transaction. There is a reason that the practice of external audits exists instead of just having bank accounts that can be checked by the public through a phone call.
* With bitcoin accounts, you could borrow the bitcoin or otherwise tamper with the money while still showing it in the account that you sign... You could even rent a signature/account.
* The same can be said for dollars.
If there was any demand for it, a company could set up a bank account with real money (or a new bank could exist with this feature for accounts) that could be checked by the public at any time. That is unless this is being prevented by legislation -- in which case the same legislation will eventually apply to bitcoin businesses. But at the end of the day real bank accounts or bitcoin wallets will always still continue to require external auditors with access in order to really be sure of the balance and integrity of the funds. 
In fact, bitcoin has a significant weakness in that someone can abscond with funds simply by sending them to a new address and nobody would ever be able to tell if it was theft or some sort of elaborate hack/security breach. Also, as pointed out by below, it is impossible to prove that you are the only person with access to a particular private key for a bitcoin account.

Yawn... 


Why would having no-fee, peer-to-peer bitcoin transactions matter since your peer will still have to convert into his own currency afterwards? At least two major flaws in this line of reasoning.
A. This logic is based on the bitcoiner pipe dream that the whole world will adopt bitcoin and we won't have to do any conversions because we can spend our bitcoin as bitcoin. This is ridiculous for countless reasons:
* Some countries will always have a vested interest in managing their own currencies and will ensure that the domestic currency is preferred by vendors over uncontrolled, non-domestic currencies like bitcoin. They would clamp down if bitcoin gained enough traction to threaten this policy and then you couldn't spend your bitcoin at any big publicly traded companies, chains, non-shady stores, etc. 
* Not many people or vendors in the world have shown any interest in adopting bitcoin and we could argue all day as to why, but it's objectively true.
* If you make a comparable assumption for ActualMoney (e.g. "one day all people globally will be able to spend USD locally and there will be a major bank that has branches in every single country with no conflicting regulatory frameworks and no local conversion needed") then ActualMoney still wins out for peer-to-peer transactions as they will also be free.
* Etc... Seriously...
B. Bitcoin has fees *other than conversion to another currency* built into peer-to-peer (and any other) transactions! There is no avoiding the *middle man* miner who you need to pay for the transaction to go through. There is also no avoiding the indirect inflationary fee of the block reward. We can further assume that as the block reward drops, transaction fees will rise. Look up calculations of the actual average cost of a bitcoin transaction and tell me it's really competitive!


This is the equivalent to saying "you don't need a middle man if you make no transactions"...

If you're really trying to speak logically about whether bitcoin is a good mechanism for "wealth storage", I suggest not using any window of time. Instead, I think it makes sense to ask yourself what percentage of bitcoin holders have seen specific levels of returns or stability. That would likely look something like this:
~1% -- Got bitcoins before 2013 and made an enormous amount of money.
~15% -- Got Goxed or rocked by any of the other flaws in this 'storage' mechanism and lost all of their stored wealth.
~50% -- Got in at $500+ and lost their ass.
~33% -- Got in at $200-$500 in the past year and are mostly losers who are out a quarter or more of their investment already but still manage to not be the biggest losers in the bitcoin world. As time goes on they will look more like the $500+ group.

Civil unions don't. They do almost the same thing. Like bean bag guns or knives. And since the act of marriage has a good deal of tradition and symbolism involved, the tradition and symbolism matter.

Credit card processors are also temporary middle men. We only need them for a few more years while we wait for the highly anticipated Mind Teleportation Network that is in the works for ActualMoney. Please don't be distracted by the fact that both bitcoin and ActualMoney have required payment processing middle men for many years in practical application. 
At least with ActualMoney credit cards the rewards are generally passed to the customer and there is a good measure of convenience and consumer protection. With bitcoin you get higher fees for less services.

You may think that's a cute response but if you can't actually confront my argument, I don't think it speaks well for your position.
Let me put this concept in yet another form. Let's say that your company pays you your salary in bitcoin and a vendor actually DOES accept bitcoin. You can pay that vendor directly in bitcoin and they take your bitcoin and give you their product or service. Would it be reasonable to say that vendor accepts *time* as a payment method? After all, you gave your employer your time and they converted it into bitcoin, which you then gave to the vendor. The answer is no. If your payment has to be converted into another form before it is accepted then the company is not actually adopting whatever currency or commodity you originally had. I like this illustration because it moves bitcoin into a different part of the equation so you might be able to see past your ideas about dollars.

That does not follow from what Pauldogwalker said.

Cash is divisible etc. and cash is what gets accepted by Microsoft in reality and in my conceptual example.

Better consumer protection with bitcoin? You could have your fiat credit account hacked 100 times by every single merchant you shared information with and you still haven't lost a dollar. Start with that and reevaluate your line of thinking.
And again, you are losing your ability to make large credit purchases, thus it isn't the free lunch it's being represented as.

The only bitcoin I've ever had was given to me and is in a change tip account. Hilariously,  it has probably declined over 50% in value.

I consider bitcoin a blessing because r/conspiratard was getting really boring before you guys came along and took the reigns as the most toxic and consistently wrong group of cultists on reddit (to be fair, r/conspiracy and r/bitcoin have a lot of user overlap so it's basically the same people)

You pay high hidden/indirect fees right now in the form of the miner subsidy. Those will become high direct fees as the miner subsidy decreases. You really should learn more about bitcoin before you speak so confidently. You are correct that you don't have any of the protections or features of fiat credit acounts though. 


Maybe you just haven't tried to interact with anyone yet. Bitcoin has no implications on this front. You can spend cash with drug dealers but as soon as you want to buy a house (even if you put 100% down) you will have to prove where you got the money from and that it isn't being laundered. This is an example to show that nothing would be different under bitcoin if it was really being used. As of right now is only used for alpaca socks and you're right in the technical sense that nobody really cares about your alpaca sock purchases.

@_date: 2015-03-18 14:43:20
You really are thick. Yes,  companies don't accept Visa as a currency. They accept it as a payment processor but of course the currency they are accepting is cash. Microsoft accepts bitpay as a payment processor but doesn't accept bitcoin as the currency, they accept cash. If bitpay added support for paycoin, Microsoft wouldn't suddenly be accepting paycoin from people who give paycoin to bitpay. They would still be accepting cash because bitpay does the conversion. If bitpay starts accepting cars and converting them to cash, that doesn't mean Microsoft accepts cars. Maybe you should make some flash cards and go through more examples to get this concept into your head.

If you're really trying to speak logically about whether bitcoin is a good mechanism for "wealth storage" or a good investment, I suggest not using any window of time. Instead, I think it makes sense to ask yourself what percentage of bitcoin holders have seen specific levels of returns or stability. That would likely look something like this:
~1% -- Got bitcoins before 2013 and made an enormous amount of money.
~15% -- Got Goxed or rocked by any of the other flaws in this 'storage' mechanism and lost all of their stored wealth.
~50% -- Got in at $500+ and lost their ass.
~33% -- Got in at $200-$500 in the past year and are mostly losers who are out a quarter or more of their investment already but still manage to not be the biggest losers in the bitcoin world. As time goes on they will look more like the $500+ group.
Be realistic, do you think the real percentages are much different than this? Do you think it makes sense to say bitcoin is a good "wealth storage" mechanism?

Relevance? 
1) this thread is about bitcoin supposedly being a good investment
2) there is an ongoing argument about what time frames to use
3) bitcoin is supposedly different than a pump-and-dump penny stock so it shouldn't be compared to them for validation
4) there are no major stocks with this profile of losses amongst investors
5) most people investing in stocks use diversified portfolios and many collect matching employer contributions or tax benefits/deferrals, which gives them vastly better outcomes than the bitcoiners I've classified here

There isn't a technological constraint preventing this from happening with ActualMoney, only regulation prevents it. The same type of regulation would eventually prevent this with bitcoin if it became popular enough to warrant the attention of regulators. Your idea is childish. 


To say that bitcoin cannot be regulated is completely asinine. What if a government said that any business caught transacting in bitcoin would be fined $1 million or closed? What if they said any person caught making p2p transactions with bitcoin without paying a special tax would be jailed? Obviously bitcoin companies already show how easily they can be forced to comply with KYC/AML...
Of course this doesn't even get into the fact that bitcoin transactions explicitly require permission from centralized miners who could easily be related and forced to ignore certain transactions...

This whole thread (actually this whole subreddit) is about the value bitcoin creates (i.e. the free lunch) and it really doesn't create any. That's not a straw man. 
Saying that you don't "control your money" with fiat is ludicrous. In what way don't you control it? You choose what vendors to deal with and what authorizations you give them (you can even ask your bank to prevent any pull requests from a specific vendor if you're paranoid). In the case that something happens that you didn't authorize, you are able to reverse or fix the issue and your funds are insured. That really is much more control than you have with bitcoin. If your bitcoin is compromised you lose it irrevocably and there are ten million ways to lose it that befuddled even experienced security experts. 


This is false and I'm not sure you could quantify these metrics anyway. More power? What about the power of a society to control the monetary levers that facilitate their economy? That's not a power offered by bitcoin. What about the power to transact without paying enormous fees for a network of wasteful machines working on artificially intense busy work? Obviously anyone who isn't brainwashed could go on and on about how false your statement is.

Which I just explained is wrong... Miners are middle men and they are not doing conversion... Bitcoin is not useful for p2p or regular transactions. You can't defend these points. I do agree that you are wasting your time.

There is no difference between telling him to keep the $10,000 in btc or telling him to convert a hypothetical $10,000 from USD into btc.

So your argument is now changing to rely on the idea that Microsoft is physically receiving and/or holding bitcoin. This is progress! 
Microsoft uses bitpay, the payment processor, to accept the currency known as the dollar. Bitpay accepts bitcoin but that isn't relevant to whether Microsoft does. 
You can look this all up for yourself. Microsoft reports zero holdings of bitcoin in their reports and I can't circle a page that *doesn't* report bitcoin holdings.

No. Marketing. They have no reason to say "technically we don't really and the actual complicated process is..." because that doesn't make for good marketing and nobody except a small group of nerds really cares about whether they technically do or not.


Yes, I work for one of these companies. How is that relevant? I didn't say anything about whether a company could do business in multiple currencies and it doesn't affect the concepts in our discussion.


Umm what? I have a degree in finance, work in finance and operations for a global manufacturer with suppliers and customers that use different currencies, I follow bitcoin and I followed the Microsoft story. I don't have to justify my solid reasoning by using my background, but even if I did I would be in a good position.

Lol do you think the owner of the company that is providing your "bitcoin-paying job" wants to pay taxes on non-existent profit by not expensing your wages (which then tells the IRS exactly how much you made)?

And what corporation makes so little revenue that they want to risk it all by not reporting their sales accurately? Their deflated numbers would open them up to all kinds of legal liability, decrease their traditional financing availability and push away potential investors...

Apple, a publicly-traded company with more to lose than to gain by illegally evading a sales tax, continues charging sales tax on sales of the phone you want -- how does bitcoin help you avoid sales tax?

Yikes this is tiresome. You don't know more about this than anyone else. The pecking order is generally professionals/academics--&gt;people who don't care--&gt;conspiracy theorists. You're at the bottom of the chain. Knowing some conspiracy trivia about the fed and the gold standard (all of which is covered during the first hours of a four-year finance curriculum) does not make you interesting and it certainly doesn't make you informed or equipped to have a serious opinion about anything. You could maybe get a cab driver or the guy who cleans your pool to act impressed.

What? I've looked through your account history a few times simply because I can't believe that you are serious... I'm astonished at the things you say but you are either sincere or under deeeep cover.
FYI the world economy *is* doing amazing when you compare it to the world economy under mercantilism -- the system you're advocating, which lasted for thousands of years and resulted in complete stagnation and innovation at a rate 1000x slower than today.

Pretty sure I also pointed out some concerns with your logic. The fact that you don't even understand something as simple as the difference between lose/loose while simultaneously claiming to understand so much more about the world than people who don't invest in bitcoin is just icing. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:30:50
Given that fiat can be used for anything, the limit for bitcoin is being equally useful and even that seems highly unlikely/hopeful. Still no advantages being described and the OP question remains salient.

I think you don't understand how taxes work. ABC owns the business. XYZ works there. ABC will tell the IRS how much he paid XYZ because he gets to expense the salary and because it's a requirement if he doesn't want to have his profitable business shut down. Bitcoin doesn't make this more complicated and it doesn't change anything about it.

Personally I would like Bitcoin to be neutral, but I seem to be a minority(or perhaps part of a silent majority).

That was not an argument for why this is about bitcoin. That was just a long-winded way of saying these sites did indeed use bitcoin and *you feel* that this is about bitcoin. There was no logical support or evidence for your position -- and these sites were both breaking lots of laws. So...

If you're really trying to speak logically about whether bitcoin is a good mechanism for "wealth storage" or a good investment, I suggest not using any window of time. Instead, I think it makes sense to ask yourself what percentage of bitcoin holders have seen specific levels of returns or stability. That would likely look something like this:
~1% -- Got bitcoins before 2013 and made an enormous amount of money.
~15% -- Got Goxed or rocked by any of the other flaws in this 'storage' mechanism and lost all of their stored wealth.
~50% -- Got in at $500+ and lost their ass.
~33% -- Got in at $200-$500 in the past year and are mostly losers who are out a quarter or more of their investment already but still manage to not be the biggest losers in the bitcoin world. As time goes on they will look more like the $500+ group.
Be realistic, do you think the real percentages are much different than this? Do you think it makes sense to say bitcoin is a good "wealth storage" mechanism?

Either you hold $30k worth of bitcoin in that wallet and you're exposed to that risk, or you maintain a separate fiat credit account on top of your bitcoin wallet and you're exposed to that risk, or you have neither a $30k bitcoin wallet nor a separate fiat credit account and you lose the capacity to make large transactions when you need to. You're not getting a free lunch by using bitcoin.
You know what is kind of a free lunch? The ability to use credit and take advantage of insurance that pools risk.

It's long-winded if what you're saying could fit into one small sentence. Everything's relative. I don't understand your question. Read your original post again and tell me if it presented any actual logic. It was just a non-sequitur...
"Seals with clubs used bitcoin. Silk road used bitcoin. *Bizarre leap with no support:* Shutting down these sites that were obviously facilitating illegal activity was somehow an attack specifically against bitcoin."

Governmental request
@_date: 2015-02-18 23:42:47
Your hypothetical took everything down the slippery slopes to extremity. Thus you interpreted DasTerribru's support for government and rule of law as his potential to "be a good enforcer of fugitive slave laws and mass genocide" and I conversely extrapolated that your anti-state views would make you a supporter of allowing people to enslave others without the government getting in their way.

He said there is such a thing as the rule of law and it has a purpose. To which you responded "Sounds like you'd be a good enforcer of fugitive slave laws and mass genocide. Well done."
I said that your hypothetical took everything down the slippery slopes to extremity and I conversely extrapolated that, in this bizarrely exaggerated hypothetical, your anti-state views would make you a supporter of allowing people to enslave others without the government getting in their way. Wikipedia doesn't conflict with anything I said or make you seem any less silly.
This recap shouldn't be necessary.

Cringe. I hope you're a teenager. And yes, I'm likening your thoughts on inflation to the concepts behind mercantilism and even while you're reacting to that you can't help but stammer about *"inflation is theft!"*, inadvertently strengthening the connection.

I don't think removing context increases clarity...
Bitcoin can be an inherently neutral technology and still be aligned with political views... that was obviously his point (Further confirmed when he says 5 minutes later that that was obviously his point...)
You're obviously determined to act like an angsty teenager. Staying in this echo chamber is going to be vital to your ego.
