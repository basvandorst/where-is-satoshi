Because if they execute a 51% attack, it could lead to a crisis of confidence in bitcoin and all those coins you're mining would crash in value.

Does the private key get printed? If so, wouldn't a record of it exist in the printer's memory for an indeterminate time?

Thanks for the clear reply, I'm glad this issue is something you've thought about! Great work on the device.

[Better than most]( in Europe. The Krona has appreciated 10% against the Euro in the last year, and unemployment is around 4%, heading towards 2%.

Am I worried that bitcoin is the harbinger of the apocalypse as told in revelations? Can't say that I am.
Am I worried that bitcoin is the one world currency that the Alex Jones crowd fears? No. It's a distributed, decentralised currency, not some construct like SDRs foisted upon us from the IMF.

Because php is easy enough to learn that it attracts a lot of beginner developers, people who know just enough to be dangerous.
There are a lot of outdated scripts and tutorials for php, so while it's possible for a new coder to copy and paste their way to a (more or less) functioning system, there can be all sorts of vulnerabilities introduced along the way.
Php in and of itself isn't necessarily bad, in capable hands it's perfectly fine and there are some fantastic frameworks for it, however the simplicity and widespread support of it means there's a lot of crappy code out there.

Actually I don't think it's because of bitcoin at all. I think it's more to do with compliance for AML (anti money laundering) and KYC (know your customer) laws.
Seeing as more banks than just Chase are implementing this scheme, it seems maybe they're either preempting regulatory changes, or giving a token effort to *avoid* putative regulatory changes by being able to point at this move and say "see? we're doing something about it".

I completely disagree. In no way is saying "I have a bomb" on par with actually possessing a bomb with intent to use it.
Sure, saying "I have a bomb" in the wrong circumstances can be a dumb thing to do, and anyone doing so will suffer the consequences, but to conflate jokes with acts of violence is an assault on free speech.

Localbitcoins allows cash deposits in the seller's account.
Also, there's an implicit assumption here that what's bad for the banks is good for bitcoin.

While I am quite sceptical of Libertarianism, I really would like an honest discussion with its proponents. Unfortunately, on Reddit, those threads seem to quickly degenerate into snarky circlejerk pretty quickly. That wasn't my intention, but I was aware that it was a likely result.
Is there anywhere which is open to an exchange of dialogue without anyone feeling the need to get defensive or aggressive?


This is exactly the type of question I'd like to explore, in an intellectually honest and non-combative mannner. I feel this sub is not the place for such a discussion, however.

Citing Dragon's Den as a source for valuing a company is like citing Pawn Stars for the valuation of heirlooms.

I get your point, but I would argue that we're heading into [neofeudalism]( rather than communism.

Or the people killed by booze barons protecting their bootleg alcohol operations. Oh wait, why doesn't that happen any more?

I think it's clear from the context that "borders" refers to national borders. Nobody is claiming that bitcoin can operate outside of physical limits.
When you say Paypal is better connected, do you mean it simply has more users? While that's definitely the case, it has been around for longer, has a substantial marketing budget, and is tightly integrated with the world's number one auction site.

But if he has very little capital gains between the time he's paid and when he converts to USD, wouldn't he pay very little tax?

Is there anyone here who's able to use this data to produce some infographics or interactive media exploring the current state of BTC?

Gotcha. Put 5% of my portfolio into bullets.
