btc is the “mothership”

its maybe overvalued in general: legal limitations, security concerns, unregulated and OTC markets... but not so off fundamentally

The first and mayor thing in crypto is to figure out who has no idea, speaking random bullshit and who has

no1 can predict the price after an year, even after a day..., I wouldn’t say an ATH in 2019 is impossible, but can’t say it’s confirmed or logical in any way, given the current price movements

things are happening faster now, due to much higher attention-rate and crypto awareness in general. if the chart turns out to be correct, you can see that downtrend happened much faster

As you can sense from the chart, I am doing the exact opposite thing

bears are downvoting hard... only the moon will tell guys

I use 2 x falling wedge, no descending, no triangles
