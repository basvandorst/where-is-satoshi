The way i see bitcoin is we are betting on its future right now is not very uselful as currency becasue many people still not understand it is still not accepted by many the price movements are crazy. If you put money and hold is in hopes that in the future it would be accepted by most and that it would be  easy to obtain and secure. Once that happends the price would be stable with very low % movements. When would this happend and if it would happend no one knows.

Bitcoin is not a company is a technology that right now is getting better and more people are accepting if you willing to invest 10,000 is because you belive this technology would get better and more people would accept it. Your 10,000 would grow depending on the amount of acceptance this technology recives and if people start using it more. No one knows what the price of bitcoin would be. 
Also if you are willing to put 10,000 i would do some research about the different methods of storing bitcoin.
 Bitcoin  can be stored in exchange. Like bank if the bank closes down your money is gone.
It can be stored in your computer, mobile device.Like storing your money in your house under your bed.
Another and most recommended is hardware wallet. Is like storing your money in safe in your home.
