As a cpu miner for alt coins i must say that even theres been shoddy things in the past such as solidcoin, i will admit, mcxnow is an actual good exchange. But same thing applies to alt exchanges to fiat exchanges, NEVER keep coins in the exchange, and you will be fine.

South african bank slogans are also appropriate...  
  
ABSA - Today, Tomorrow, Together  
Standard Bank - Moving Forward  
Capitec Bank - Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication  
Nedbank - Make things happen  
And this is a so so one in relation to bitcoin  
  
FNB - How can we help you
