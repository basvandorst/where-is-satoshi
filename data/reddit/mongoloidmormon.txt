It was in Coinbase, but I've checked both. No luck. Hopefully, they'll get this resolved soon.

Who is going to loan bitcoin to the government? Who loaned the gold?

Before fiat, the governments just debased their currencies. Bitcoin cannot be debased.

If there were increased efficiencies in production without expansion of the money supply, then there would be constant price deflation. And no, it doesn't matter how it is measured.

Do you mean when they recalled the money, debased, and re-coined? I think that's called inflating the money supply. What happened to the Spanish empire, the British empire, the Dutch?

For insured parties, they could only allow BTC transfers to approved/verified addresses. Of course, they'd have to develop a verification program for vendors and the like.

Paul Krugman is a moron.

Izabella Kaminska is a moron. It continually surprises and amazes me that these dimwits can make money writing about a field of study they do not comprehend.

That amount of money is chump change to a government that prints $85 Billion every month.

I, too, just did a $2,000 gift card for Amazon and then promptly bought back 2 BTC with fiat. The transaction was easy and I get 3% back. Nice.
