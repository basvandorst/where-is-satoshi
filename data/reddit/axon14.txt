No disagreement that we're all looking to get paid.   It's just that most of us don't have so much influence that we can quite literally make a coin that was sitting around $300 in october surge in value by working together to manipulate the market.

been in crypto a few years now.  While I've lost money on paper, I've never actually cashed out at anything but a profit.  That's because it's not real until you sell.   See:

It's less that they don't want it and more that they have substantially more to gain by pumping BCH right now and dumping BTC as they do so.  max out your gains on BTC, then pump BCH.   Essentially cash out 100% of your portfolio while still maintaining 100% of your portfolio.   And then the coin that you are on the core dev team of is the leading coin.

BCH has now experienced two pump and dumps.  The first was about a month ago when they killed segwit2x, and now this.  Both involved coinbase.  Very troubling.

He nailed it.  Wall Street doesn't like Bitcoin, or any crypto, because they are on the outside looking in.  Just like he described...Wall Street does its own IPOs and then buys the IPO shares, and when they are valued enough, they dump them.  From the opening second to the sell off, Wall Street has control and Wall Street is the one making the fortune.    
Bitcoin and Crypto are another animal.  It is a revelation. It is a revolution.  It is foreign money that they can't turn their noses up at.  It is individual money that they can't control or charge fees on.  Yes, it's speculative, but so are stocks; they are nothing, they are no matter, they are not on the elemental chart.  They are numbers on a ticker.   Sure, the company makes something, but BTC is also something.   Stocks can rise and fall based on a conference call.   BTC is vulnerable to FUD, but not in a way Wall Street understands. 
These assholes were too busy acting exactly like the douches in American Psycho - worrying about who has the high-end designer socks, who has the hottest girlfriend, and who has the best business card with a water mark - to notice BTC and the associated cryptos.  And now they're pissed.

Some comments from someone who has been in BTC since 2013.
"The potential for huge upside was based on HUGE RISK and low market cap. "    No one ever thought we'd ever see $20,000, quite honestly.  People might have shit talked about it, but no one believed it.    Most people were interested in getting in on what they perceived as a revolution, they thought mining was cool (back when it was possible to actually do it) or otherwise day trading just like we see today.  HODL wasn't a thing yet.    Anyway, there's still huge risk, i'd say the risk is even higher now because a BTC costs so much more.     This is not an official currency (although it can be taxed like it is).    Your BTC could shit the bed tomorrow, which is why if you're "all in," "put the house in," whatever, you're fucking yourself up.   Be diverse on traditional stocks and be in crypto as well.
No more than 10x?   Shit.    If someone is complaining about that, they must only have .000000021 btc.  I'd take 10x in 2021.    One BTC would be worth $77,000 usd.   Whats wrong with that?    If you're selling at that point, you're going to end up missing out on another 10x.    China's got all this BTC for a reason, IMO, and I want to be on that train.
HODL:  you should never unload your whole portfolio anyway.   You don't need a lambo, you need a house and you *want* to be able to buy reasonable things whatever whenever guilt free without credit.    That's what BTC has done for me.  Most people I know sweat to pay their cell phone bill or car lease.  Anyway, even though that wallet is now "down" from the ATH of December 2017, whenever it was, it's still up like 1000% from purchase.   With enough time, that will be you as well.

You can take a year or two off, yeah.  But you can't retire at 32 with a mil.  
It's better to keep working, reinvest some of that cash, and don't make any major lifestyle changes or blow it.  If used correctly, you can treat it as a nearly unlimited savings account.

Watch datadash.  His commentary was that a frighteningly small percentage of people control a disproportionately large part of BTC's destiny.  He's absolutely right.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:58:49
I agree.    I tend to just add in small amounts, but when I see a clear chance to add big (such as the $5500 dip a couple weeks ago late on a saturday night EST), I add big.  
@_date: 2019-04-13 18:31:41
For me, it is about bucking the system.     Obviously if that enhances my financial profile, so be it.   A warning:   I made some decent dough off the $19k spike.  You know what the only real difference is?   I don't sweat when the bill comes to the table at dinner.    A lambo aint practical, I still drive my CR-V.   I already owned a home, a beach house would run 100k in taxes where I live in addition to a ridiculous mortgage, and my kids couldn't find sand if they were on a beach academically, so I'm not trying to spend $40k on private school a year.
Life is otherwise the same.

I've got my handful that I've obtained over the years at times like this.     Don't overthink it.   Chill, HODL, profit.   
Personally, I am thinking year 2039, not 2019.   BTC will either be invaluable at that time, or DOA.   But I suspect the former will be true, and whole coiners will be incredibly wealthy.   
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:46:02
In investment terms, the market cap of LTC is smaller, so it takes less money to have a major effect on the price of LTC.   This also usually means a bull market creates more positive change for LTC - percentage wise.   Though this has not always proven true to date for cryptos.  This is virtually identical to silver, where a number of top 10 corporations are actually worth more than all the silver in the world.   
LTC is much more affordable, like silver is more affordable than gold.
There are 80 mil LTCs vs. 21 million BTCs.   Like silver and gold, LTC (silver) is far more plentiful.  
LTC is, technically, a better, safer tech, much like silver is a much more useful metal than gold.   LTC confirms transactions much more quickly than BTC because, conceptually, LTC was designed to correct the "flaws" in BTC.

No disagreement.  Fundamentally, cryptos are about getting in early.   But that is true for any stock/crypto.  
One thing I learned for crypto: it's not how much you invest, but how many coins you own.  That's your real multiplier.  If you put in $40,000 right now you're only getting 10 BTC.  If you had done that in 2014 - to your original point - you were a millionaire this week.    And you don't need to buy a ton when it's low, though that of course works.  You can buy just 1/2, 1/4 btc during each dip, slowly build up.   The dips last a while, the highs don't.  Whales can afford to buy in 250k worth, you and I, probably not.  
Still, I truly do expect a $20,000 per BTC value.    I only have a certain amount of skin in the game, so this is not wishful thinking, or my own little fantasy scenario.  I just think the market is going to continue to grow.     We lost about 9% today.  And now...it looks like it is stabilizing to me.   Because BTC is not going anywhere but up.

Silver to BTC's gold.   ETH is its own thing.   
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:26:14
Too early to say right now. I find it odd that the coins were "pre-mined," but the tech appears to be respectable.   
Thing is, ripple is currently so cheap that it's worth throwing in a few bucks and seeing what happens.  If you put in $100 right now (304ish XRP),  a valuation of $5 later nets you 1500.   Put in $1k USD, and it's $15,000 at that same $5.  
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:53:15

Agreed.  If you don't see events like today as opportunity, I don't know what to say.   If you can get and HODL 10 btc....imagine what it might be worth in 2030.   Imagine $20k pet BTC.  Imagine 50k per....Impossible?  That's what people would have said in 2014 about a $5k BTC.
