Fair enough. Would be interesting to see :)

His second-to-last post on bitcointalk is rather chilling:
"It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context.  WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet's nest, and the swarm is headed towards us."

There has been talk about where bitcoin is going to settle. The past few days it has been sitting around 110 USD. Where do you think it will end up 3 months from now? 1 year later?

I feel the fact that it is anonymous won't affect 99% of users. That mainly impacts the black market at present. Hopefully by the time drugs are legalised then Bitcoin will be more useful for general transactions.
There will be a great impact for people located in traditionally untrusted countries if Bitcoin takes hold. Imagine trying to purchase something online if you live in Nigeria. With Bitcoin the delivery country isn't an issue anymore.
I think it is incredible for online merchants. They have had to deal with reverse charges, other credit card fraud, PayPal screwing them over, PCI compliance. Setting up a website and being able to accept payments the next day really simplifies things.

Long term I think it will definitely grow, but in the short term I feel like it will trail off as people realise just how complicated it is. 
Managing change addresses and backing up frequently enough is not something that people want to think about. 
Electrum does a good job of managing this, though I think there needs to be more education about change addresses, especially when used with paper wallets. Its far to complicated for the average user.
My guess is 60-100 USD a year from now, unless there is a massive uptake in businesses accepting Bitcoins so we can actually buy things day-to-day.

Don't you think another service will pop up to take its place? 
If there is big panic like that then it could be very profitable for those thinking long term.

Indeed. Share them with us too if you can get them :)
I'm guess I'm just really trying to point out how incredible this bubble is, if indeed it is just a bubble.
Do you think it is different from June 2011? That one trailed off for 6 months then slowly grew for a year. That seems pretty normal. The media gets bored and awareness drops.
On the other hand, the current growth is pretty amazing when you look at that two year graph, and awareness is huge now - to the point that it will remain relevant for a sustained period, perhaps indefinitely.
