Your wallet is not a bank. It is not secure like a bank until you take proper precautions, it is not protected or supported like a bank. Apart from storing and sending money, it shares no properties with a bank.
Your wallet is a wallet. That's why it's called "wallet".

Bitcoin presents advantages in the form of money that is transferrable instantly worldwide. It is also a solution to a problem of modern currency where more money can be printed, reducing the value of the currency as a whole.
If you have no issue with the way your local currency is managed in terms of the above, there is no real advantage of paying with Bitcoin over a debit or credit card for domestic payments.
If you live in a country with a shitty currency, or travel a lot, Bitcoin would be extremely useful for payments if enough places accepted it.

He talks about the potential for changing the rules as if it's a problem, or a bug, or a vulnerability. It's an intended and unavoidable feature of cryptographically-verified P2P-based data exchange.
People who do not specifically alter their Bitcoin clients to adhere to a new ruleset will ignore those with modified clients and continue on the same chain without issue. It's essentially like forking a codebase to continue with your own project, there's nothing wrong with it, yet there's incorrect implication in the article that there is.

That's being unnecessarily pedantic in order to play down a lack of due care and attention to the security of your server(s). Your database was leaked and your database contains sensitive information.
The fact that you're refusing to apologise for this over a mere technicality between some database user somehow being compromised instead of an SQL injection is downright stupid.
It would be wise not to pretend it's not as bad as it is. You'll only lose more faith than is already lost if you try to play it off as though it's not a big deal.
If you were taking card payments, the PCI-DSS would be all over you like a horrible rash. The mere fact that somebody was able to get read-access on *anything* on your server is almost just as good (and *can* be just as good) as having an SQL injection flaw.

As somebody who has been in IT retail, that's not how wholesalers work.

As a host who also accepts Bitcoins, I can say it's currently a pain in the arse with all the fluctuation. If you don't want the hassle, I'd say wait until it balances out nicely.
Also thus far, accepting Bitcoins in the hosting sector seems to attract some undesirable customers. Whilst they will pay, they will sign up with fake details and some have been terrible people to deal with, when compared with our normal customer base who don't use Bitcoins.

There are ample opportunities to convert BTC to your local currency in most major countries in the case you can't find a place to spend them.
If you can convert them to local currency, it's just as good as any other payment method, if not better if you consider the fees associate with taking payments online.

What's wrong with this? They should be allowed to choose their customers. The fact that they've written to you to let you know their stance and given you a chance to stop and keep the account, or let you know of their position ahead of time so you can withdraw your money and close your account with as little inconvenience as possible, is quite commendable, I think.
They're probably concerned about money laundering, and rightly so. This strikes me as pragmatic and I bet if Bitcoin got properly regulated, they wouldn't have a problem with it. This actually makes me think they're a good bank who have their heads properly screwed on.

Anarchistic rhetoric nonsense. PKI was in use within some governments a long time before the public even knew about it. If you think they're powerless at stopping anything like this, you are sorely mistaken and are looking at it from the wrong angle.
The reason they're not moving to ban it right now is because there's barely any incentive for them to do so.

Boo hoo, they lost money trying to invest in a relatively new, noteably volatile currency. I can sympathise, but only a little.

Come to the UK, our personal current accounts are all fee free aside from if you go overdrawn. Free ATMs everywhere.
@_date: 2013-09-05 16:52:15
Of course they can. Free your mind for a moment. Bitcoin is a wallet just as much as the cash wallet PayPal provide you - there will be literally no difference.
Ah, one difference is that if you pay with Bitcoin through PayPal, you won't be able to chargeback later.
@_date: 2013-07-28 06:28:32
So do magnetic stripes and chip&amp;pin? There's a reason PayPass has a maximum payment amount and a period where you must manually authorise your card once in a while, fraud prevention and damage control, everybody is fully aware of the weaknesses, but nothing beats the convenience of just swiping your card over a reader for 2 seconds.

Except tax is a good thing if it's done properly. Which it isn't, which is why I understand the anti-tax sentiment, but denying tax in its purest conceptual form is just silly and is what I see from a lot of Bitcoin users.

As I stated previously, the competency of spending is another issue entirely. It's a lot easier to point out the stupid things they do than the things they do right.

Not quite groceries, but we're accepting Bitcoin for web hosting services at  (UK, use R1EO0Z8DYH at checkout for 20% off)
And I know  also takes orders for Fast Food establishments in the UK and accept Bitcoin too (not affiliated).
@_date: 2013-03-20 19:05:31
Depends how you look at it. Soliders willing to accept payment doing said actions or governments funding said actions. The issue is way more complex than currency and tax alone.

If enough people want change, they can make it happen in either situation with some organisation. See every recent revolt in the Middle Eastern region.

Still accepting Bitcoin at  despite the crazy fluctuations :)

Not a financial expert even in the slightest, but I think what he means is that once the price of BTC hits $1000 margin trading becomes pretty attractive and the volume of the margin trades will have a stabilising effect on the price of Bitcoin.
I think that's one of the reasons why other popular currency is as stable as it is when compared to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-20 22:13:04
That's bullshit, you're inferring what you want to hear.

Humans don't work that simply.
If Bitcoin takes a high jump, maybe nobody will buy because they fear it will fall suddenly after, which in actuality is the very reason a fall may happen. A self-fulfilling fallacy.
If it gets negative press, people will be standing by for BTC price drops and buy when it starts dropping a few dollars, increasing exchange activity volume and then essentially preventing BTC from dropping further than it normally would.
Irrational human behaviour affects markets everywhere, Bitcoin is no exception.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:17:14
The fact that you think the state of has a significant effect on Bitcoin price is hilarious. Add me to one of those "downvoting shills" you stupid fuck.
@_date: 2013-03-20 16:59:19
Yes, bring up controversial issues to the topic to throw it off the main point.
In any case, yes it basically boils down to a public service given that the objective of the military of a country is to protect and maintain national security with both defence and offence. You likely know nothing of what a country's military and security agencies is actually preventing from occuring, so despite what you may think the money could be being well-spent (the problem is not knowing whether or not it really is, but that's an issue to bring up in an entirely different topic).
By not paying your tax because you don't believe in your country's military action, you're neither stopping nor preventing what you disagree with, nor will you alleviate any guilt associated with the military's actions by way of your supporting of it through funding via taxes. The only way to fix the problem is via political channels, writing to people, voting, becoming a politician, that kind of thing.
@_date: 2013-03-20 19:38:12
He was talking about America. I was talking about countries who spend on their military to wage war other countries for various reasons.

You were born into those services, it's tough shit, you want to change it, follow the system you were lucky enough to be born into or move to a country with a better system if they're gracious enough to welcome you.
@_date: 2013-03-20 19:46:29
If you're provided with a service, you should pay for it and if you do not you should not expect to get away with it.
Do you drive? You use public roads. Do you use water? Possibly government-subsidised. Do you use the Internet? Depending on the type of connection you use, those physical connections may also be government-subsidised. Your government may have even created the Internet depending on where you're from. Are you able to go through your day with reasonably certainty that enemy states will likely not attack you because you have enough reasonable means to adequately defend yourself? Guess who you have to thank.
Of course they're not perfect, but they're doing a good enough job to give you a reasonably good life and give you every chance to make a good life for yourself. If you think you can do better, you should step up, not childishly (yes, I believe it is) refusing to pay tax and hoping that solves your issues with your government.

I don't even have any money in my wallet and I probably have more wallet redundancy than most users.
Having $50,000 in Bitcoin is just as risky as having $50,000 in cash.
