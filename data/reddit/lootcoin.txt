How is that even possible?
I thought the adresses and keys are so super unique that it's more than unlikely to find an existing one just by accident.

This is why you should always send a very small amount first. Just to see if everything is set up correctly. Then you can still transfer the rest of your $$$. I did the same thing yesterday and it worked just fine (surprisingly it was even credited to my account on the same day).

Take a look at DATA if you believe in IoT/M2M. 
It's still quite cheap but has huge potential, especially since they already have a working product.

Bitcoin barely made it back above 11k and people already have their heads back in the clouds. I'd rather see it stabilize first, and then grow slowly back to it's old ATH until summer. That would be way more healthy imo.
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:39:18
Of course you can.
All you need is a USB stick with access to a wallet that contains BTC.

Well, their 24h volume was 1.450.000.000$ ... if they charge 0.1% per trade, that's 1.4M on a bad day. Then there's deposit and withdrawal fees, earned interest from cash deposits, forks, Gas, returns from investments ... I don't think it's completely impossible. But we will see how it turns out.

That's because we are still at the beginning, even though we as "early adopters" may have the impression that everything evolves around crypto nowadays. But it doesn't. The majority of people still has no clue about what's going on.

Whenever I'm sad I remind myself that there are people out there who bought Bitcoin at 20k.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:35:42
That's only true to a certain point.
While Bitcoin almost stood still for the last 3 weeks, many alt coins reached new ATHs in the mean time. Of course these gains are more vulnerable than the mediocre BC performance.

Capital gains from crypto are only tax free in Germany if you hold your coins for at least 1 year. Otherwise you'll have to apply your personal tax rate (which can go up to 42%) on every trade.
@_date: 2018-08-19 13:31:10
None of them. Crypto isn't tangible, you can't put it in your pocket like fiat or precious metals. Most of those countries with high inflation rates also have a large number of people who have never used the internet before. How are those people supposed to use something as a currency if they are lacking the knowledge, access, and devices to use it?

Do you know for sure that your MIOTA were stolen? Sometimes there's a bug in the wallet which will tell you that your balance is 0.

If you live close to Austria you can just walk into any post office and buy vouchers with cash. No ID and no verification needed. Otherwise you can also use bank transfers or credit card, but in that case you have to verify your account first.

I have almost finished my bachelor's degree, and maxed out the amount I have to pay back (10k).

The only legal way to avoid taxes on crypto in Germany is to hodl for &gt;1year. Then you can sell without being taxed. Otherwise you have to apply your personal tax rate (which can go up to 42%) on your gains for every trade.

@_date: 2018-07-27 14:25:48
When Bitcoin was priced at $15,000 the 24h volume was around $20,000,000,000. If you divide that sum by the price per Bitcoin, you know that 1,333,333 Bitcoin were traded that day. So your 100 BTC would get soaked up rather quickly.

It kind of matters because Bitcoin has limited supply, which makes it deflationary. The more demand there is, the more the price will rise. So the price could be seen as an indicator for the adoption of Bitcoin into economy.
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:51:03
