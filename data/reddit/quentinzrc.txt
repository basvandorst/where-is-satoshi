did they try to launch a currency? It'd be perfect if you had a link for me to dig on the subject :)
@_date: 2016-08-30 12:14:32
Why would you even give lbc the 1% if you're face to face? I mean you meet the guy directly, count the cash or go to the bank to certify the payment and send the coins, that's it no need for a centralized 3rd party
@_date: 2016-08-30 13:31:59
I considered the paying option as an option to simplify and secure the deal, as opposed to the free option where you take care of the risks facing the guy, fake currency, intimidation etc. To be fully honest, I sought it was some kind of craigslist and didn't figure out there was a wallet before by 3rd or 4th trade :)
But I'm not using it anymore, the pigs busted my door at 6AM to "enquire" about suspect bank activity
@_date: 2016-08-31 05:38:02
Well it turns out in my country (west europe) when you have too many cash activity on your account you get flagged, I knew about that but decided not to care and kept my accounting straight (no identities, just numbers like btc-random number), at some point I was the only local seller for 200kms arround (well the only one without 20% markup and low MOQ) so I dragged more and more people, some slightly shady but I was making a nice profit and paying taxes on it so I decided to close my eyes. Legally, I was bulletproof and as an individual I had no kyc/aml, that's most likely what made them mad :)
What pisses them off is I think one pig came to buy 100eur worth and kept talking to me about the dnms and shit like buying organs and a wife (I shit you not) so I told him it was all bs and I didn't want to know more, 10 days later I was woken up by the pigs ramming down my door, dogs, tactical unit and shit, they only found one 2 months old roach left by a friend, no drugs, weapons (we don't cary in our country), illegal stuff of any kind, they kept me 24hrs (legal delay when you have nothing against you) at the staton accusing me of money laundering, assisting crime and shit, I showed them my accounting and my taxes and they couldn't pin anything on me so they let me go, I changer my number and took down the ad now, steering clear from this market because my local btc crowd isn't the one interested by the ideology or the technical side...
Anyways, I think that's it, I just woke up and have some finals today so I'll read it again when I'm back tonight to correct mistypes and all, thanks for asking thinking about it now it was pretty fun haha (after paying the bill for the fucking door !)
PS : I participate in no illegal activity, pay my taxes on the profit I have made, don't have any drugs or weapons at home and never had

NOT TROLLING
Why the 1mb limit? I understand the reasons to raise the blocksize, but not to keep it at 1mb.
I have allready asked this question but have had mostly BS answers and downvotes, I'm curious and not looking for trolls wethere they're from btc or bitcoin
Thanks in advance for a NEUTRAL and TECHNICAL answer, i don't give a f*ck about political, blockstream and shit :)

I have wanted to create an ATM myself for some time but I'm blocked by my unability to code (except css/html)
Please keep me updated on what you decide and if you're interested to cowork on the idea mate

so then, what the fuck are you doing on this sub?!? "Bitcoin : be your own bank"
@_date: 2015-12-23 09:05:39
do you even encrypt my friend? who the fuck is gonna try to break a pgp block if they don't know what's inside?
And I agree it's the banks job, but you have to pay for it so better do it yourself :)
@_date: 2015-12-03 12:39:22
multibit is lightweight, you don't have to sync the blockchain so that's pretty neat!
But you don't run a node anymore so that sucks, it's up to you now :)
I know I had to stop using core bc it was killing my ssd, plus all the block size debate and all
@_date: 2015-12-22 15:48:46
a). explain that it's controlled by processing power and the price by supply and demand (it's a shortcut, but pretty simple and about 80% true)
b). SR was a criminal marketplace, so with criminals you allways end up getting f*cked + there were ponzis before btc, there has always been scammers everywhere
c). just like all your data, you back it up and back up that backup. It's the same with your bank except you're doing it right now
Major plus : 
-no need to pay for an account or safe at some bank, no risk of said establishment closing/going rogue etc.
- HD wallets allow you to get paid but without displaying your financial status to everyone (only if you get questions about anonymity and the blockchain)
- Some more I can't remember (will edit if I don't forget)
Major drawbacks : 
- you can loose 10% of your money in a week (for now)
- adoption by your local supermarkets, to buy fuel etc. (shure there are apps but it's not simple)
Have fun preaching my friend!
As for the good/ bad stories, either the people tell me it's only for money laundering, drugs and the pigf*ckers at ISIS, or the people simply let you blabber on until you realise they are bored. I find that people that work in banks (ironically) are really interested into it, they hear people talk about it but if you can get a little into the specifics they love to know more.

Seriously guys ??

1. name and shame
2. post screens and do a clear and simple post
3. see if other people have been scammed by the same companny
4. send them the link with all the evidence and if they still won't pay you back you can contact your local authorities (if it's a local seller) or ddos the shit out of their website/sqli/take it down/have it taken down by the hosting provider

hahahahaha, comunists... I thought better of you mate, I wonder where you read this but it's like saying the jews run the world, or illuminatis or something, please post (credible) sources before spreading misinformation, I highly doubt the UK bailed out greece also...
It's not a personnal attack, I just think you should REALLY check your sources before spreading rumours about the EU
@_date: 2016-06-08 14:27:26
I would convert only what you can afford to loose...
BTC isn't stable enough to be a viable asset for now IMO.
Also, from ouf point of view in France, if you leave you guys are royally (sorry, couldn't resist) boned. The city will leave back to Paris or Luxembourg, it will be a PITA to import/export and so your daily products that aren't produced locally will cost 20% more as import duty :)
I'd recommend you preach your friends with staying in as a better solution, you guys have all the advantages of Europe without any drawbacks so why break that?
Lastly, the example of Switzerland who isn't in Nhengen, Eurozone etc. is not viable because it took them about 10 years of cutting deals to get here, so you'll be in a world of shit for a few years. Also it's widely assumed that scottland will leave the UK to come back tu Europe and most likely Northern Ireland too, not a winning bet for you guys IMO
TLDR : don't convert more then you have to lose and don't leave EU

more of an "alternative fact" as trump would say :)
No but seriously, I agree with them, you're allowed to have a different POV but I don't consider this a lie.
I won't go further into the debate as it's been done thousands of times and usually ends up with an account being banned, have a good day and feel free to not use their tx accelerator and pay .5eur/tx :)
Cheers mate !

My experience buying on amazon with an invalid card (my own that I lost and cancelled but was still on amazon) : 
1. T = 0 : email from amazon "your order has been confirmed (or something equivalent)
2. T = 5 Minutes : email from amazon "your payment has been refused, please update payment details"
While writing this, I realized if the card isn't declared fake, cancelled, stolen etc. it goes through, point for you mate :)
But don't they have some sort of escrow mechanism for a few days until the cards get cancelled or something?

Plus wtf about breaking the network ?
@_date: 2017-01-09 15:23:56
If I understand well, you change the format of tx from binary =&gt; something like json to gain 3% blockcpace ?
And once the tx is validated you remove signatures to gain 75% of space. It does seem like a solution to the growth of the blockchain (that isn’t really a problem IMO with the price of storage and bandwidth these days) but doesn’t do anything for the blocks being full.
It’s an interresting solution but I have no idea what could happen from removing signatres of tx security wise (will I still be able to prove I made this payment and so on).
PS : in case you didn’t notice english isn’t my mother tongue so I might have missed something

That's an opinion not a fact, they are not preventing scaling they are offering an alternative. Many miners agree with them you know, and they didn't have to make any shady agreements and shit with NDAs
@_date: 2017-01-09 09:21:26
For me (on one of these pools with about 20ths), it's not about segwit, it's about soft fork vs hard fork.
I chose bitcoin because I can have a voice on the dev of my savings, I wish to stay with these principles. I'm not opposed to segwit (although I think it's an overly complicated solution for a simple problem), just to the soft fork mechanism, and I think quite a few people feel the same way :)

@_date: 2017-01-09 12:55:55
well for one it will encourage offchain scaling, paying to get your custommers tx faster than the average tx (neutrality of networks man), I might be confusing this part with LN as for me they are packaged.
However, we're in 2017, the price of storage and bandwidth has never been so low, I think 99+% of btc users (who are tech savvy in most cases, mass adoption isn't here yet) that run a node can afford to run &gt;1mb (I'm running 2 nodes, one behind 100M symetric and the other behind adsl 3/0.4M, both running well). It's a little tricky on my home connection (the slow one) but it's feasible. And I can't think of anything less complicated/risky than keeping it the way it is with a bigger blocksize.
Whatever your opinions are, I think we can agree that stalling righ now is far from the best solution, btc is getting its maximum attention af fiat currencies get shittyer and shittyer, now more than ever both sides need to chill and work together and it needs to increase capacity one way or another

Since I'm interested in comuters (8-10 years), every year I read an article about how the quantum computer is rolling out next year...

For the hardfork I have mis expressed myself, thanks for correcting, what I meant to say is that the longest chain in the event of 50/50 hardfork will win. I don't see a 13Bn market hesitating for too long before choosing witch chain to choose (see previous eth hardforks).
I did not know changes were limited in the event of a soft fork, what about swsf ? I think it does more than just remove dormant options no ?
@_date: 2017-01-09 13:01:12
Hard fork = vote with your hashpower.
For example, if one wanted to raise the limit of 21M bitcoins to be mined, with a hardfork he would need to gather 51% of the total hashpower to agree to his protocol change for a given time for this change to be implemented. With a soft fork he would simply push it like an update on an app, run the last version = you agree.
Both solutions have their pros and cons, it comes down to what you think is best (people deciding or a select group)
@_date: 2016-06-08 14:19:34
Damn, such noobery he deserved to get scammed haha
But this does rise a question, even if OP is obviously a dumbass, aren't we free to make what we wand of our money? I mean when you withrawl cash at the ATM there's nobody trying to know what you're doing wih it and suspending you account for buying weed is there?
I'm not saying he got suspended because of that, but I hear circle and others start to do this, in what way does this reprensent KYC/AML ?

reputation, absence of dns leaks, localization (sweedish compannies are best, NO usa), if not rent a bulletproof vps with bitcoin and make your own vpn.
Anyways I'd rather put my trust in a companny that accepts btc and has reviews than my ISP
@_date: 2016-02-12 10:52:46
But aren't bigger blocks (not 2mb but bigger)a part solution to decentralisation?
Because now a major part of the hashrate is in China with low electricity fees but bad connectivity, if the blocks become too large won't it force them to moove to countries with equally cheap power but better connectivity thus decentralizing the network and not keeping 51+% of the hashrate in a dictaturial country?
Not trolling mate, just curious about your opinion on the matter :)

I'm positive their products are antminers s3, C1 and a wierd double c1, plus the video on their product page was advertized by hotmine a few months back (maybe a year)... I would be careful when browsing this website, shurely don't give them any of your money !
@_date: 2015-09-28 06:52:15
Thanks for the answers, so no way of making it work yeah?
I figured the server would be unusable for  1-2 weeks with the CPU load for the time to sync the blockchain, but anyways there doesn't seem to bbe any prebuilt packages so...
As for setting it just to store the blockchain, I thought about it but it means you have to get another computer running 24/7, consuming electricity and producing heat/noise.

The closest seller is 400km away from me and sells with a 7 or 8% markup, meaning that if I take a 10% markup (witch is really big) I bother alot for 2%...
Do you guys (depending on where you live) have people selling them at the market price?

Well, I've seen the same visuals going arround used by the companny hotmine from ukraine and one other that I cn't remember, I'd be pretty carefull with this...
Plus they announced having .1w/ghs chips before everybody
Plus I have tried to communicate with hotmine because I was interested by their technology and to offer them a sales partnership and they never replied
want some more?
The idea is good but it doesn't seem to be more than a POC...
Plus they have no interchangeable HW witch means you will have to change your water boiler every 2-3 years

Hi all,
To keep it simple, I would like to distribute Bitcoin effisciently in my city in France, I'm doing so via localbitcoins but I'd like to take it to the next level and be able to distribute bulk quantities.
My issues are : 
I can't mine enough to supply the growing demand (and don't want to invest more in miners as my power isn't cheap)
I can't deposit more than 1000€/month on my bank account due to new banking regulations.
Any of you know of a workarround?
Creating a business with all the french bullshit laws is too much of a hasstle and would mean that I should sell with 15-20% markup to cover my costs so not an option.
Hope to get some info,
@_date: 2015-09-28 14:28:08
I'll get some info on different banks, but it will be linked to my identity and the company that checks for "terrorism and money laundering" has access to all bank accounts, that's some big bulls*** right here...
While opening an account abroad and getting some revenue in is shurely an offense and I can get busted with big fines, even for a small sum of money (the state is close to bankrupcy, gotta find the money somewhere)

I made many tests with miners to heat my home but the truth is that it's a really bad space heater compared to wall mounted radiatons (convecters we call then).
2 years ago, 1kw mining HW heating my bedroom only was great, last year I put 2kw hardware in my living room and except noise (relatively low, only modded GPUs) and the heat was barely suffiscient. We tried turning on all the radiators in the room with rigs unplugged, it had a power draw of 1.5kw approx to heat the room but then power draw lowered to a 200w average.
Plus try to plug in a 1ths machine today and see what you get :)
But this isn't my main point, I'm indicating it might be a scam
