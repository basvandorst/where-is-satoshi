I see your point and I am agree with is. BUT. Currently most part of businesses are not ready to accept BTC, they want to accept dollars instead. In the same time, having Bitcoin as a payment method can bring them more customers. 
That is why they do not have much choice and they have to use these services, which accept payments in btc and convert it to dollars

You are right. BTC transaction was successful, but money is stuck somewhere between Bitpay and Namecheap

 Yes, I did contact them, but there is no answer for the several days already. So I went to Reddit
Thanks, I will check the payment system you mentioned

One more problem is that businesses are pegged to the dollar (or their national currency) and have to pay taxes in it
This factor makes it difficult to accept Bitcoin

In current situation it cannot help, I think only Bitpay support can help, but it doesn't answer
As for BTCPay, I am just trying to understand, why stores use Bitpay and I am searching for alternatives of the service. Hope that it can help people to avoid my problems in the future

It's true and I am waiting the day when direct payments will be possible. But for now, unfortunately, Bitcoin payments are available only  through intermediaries. 
And after this situation with Bitpay I am trying to find some good services, which make Bitcoin payments possible today
