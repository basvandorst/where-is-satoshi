As a follow-up ... does anyone know if mining pools or exchanges are forced to provide information back to their governments? 
Are there any exchanges or pools that operate anonymously
and keep no records?

Thank you :)
Yes, my digital ebook store uses CoinBase as a payment processor
using a popular plugin, and they seem happy to accept payment,
but there doesn't seem to be any ability to send payment to their
address - at least, not with current clients and the spend fees :(
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:55:57
Has there ever been a system, to allow true micro-transactions?
Less than 10 cents for example? I don't think so ...
Bitcoin had that option, but a design flaw suggests it will be replace in the near future, with a better technology. I don't agree with your sentiment about the market deciding. 
Apple proved people will pay for individual songs, videos and apps at $1 or less. Hundreds of millions of people are comfortable with that idea.
Why not charge for content? At say ... 10 cents, or 5 cents?
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:10:12
Yes, I understand Bitcoin is divisible up to 8 places (infinite really),
but that's not my concern. 
I want to know, if it's realistically possible to send micro-transactions
worth a single USD cent, or does the current Bitcoin system present this?
(due to high fees, and clients that won't send low amounts etc)
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:14:50
Strange you should say that ... because if you look back in time, at the thousands of documents and videos that cover the advantages of Bitcoin - one of the main selling points, is the ability to send payments for less than the cost of a standard credit card fee.
This concept is very important - and I've only just discovered it's BS.
That's pretty dramatic if you ask me.
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:27:32
So - it's safe to say ... once an ALT coin comes along, that allows micro-transactions - then Bitcoin is basically dead?
The gambling, porn and content driven Internet will embrace the ability to charge tiny amounts. Micro-transactions are the future, and Bitcoin is broken :(
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:05:10
$10 is most certainly not a micro-transaction.
As far as I'm concerned, a true micro-transaction costs less than the lowest fiat money value. For example, in Australia - our lowest fiat minted coin is 5 cents.
In my opinion, a micro-transaction is say ... 1 cent ... not $10
