"He" is used as a default pronoun and has been for hundreds of years.

Have got ever considered that exchanges actually like Bitcoin Cash because you can actually use it? During December people couldn't get their BTC on to Coinbase quick enough due to blockchain congestion.

For every post here about gains/lambos, there is someone like you to balance it out. The difference is usually people like you don't post.

Agreed, but yes, unpopular opinion.

Eh? I remember exactly why I got into it which is why I sold when the transaction fees became insane.

Ah, it's the middle of February, this rumour again.

Programming isn't just any old "STEM" field. It requires a type of thinking that is extremely rare in women. This can be seen easily. Consider that the is literally nothing stopping someone making a project on github, but just try to find one piece of widely used software written by a woman.

Also thinking that this time was the same as last time. This was the only time bitcoin reached full capacity and transaction fees were through the roof.
