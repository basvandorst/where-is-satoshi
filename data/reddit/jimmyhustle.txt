Please tell me an approximate date for the uptrend to begin and end. I want to buy into the 30% upwards swing.

I'm an engineer... If anyone is poor it's you. Stop projecting bro it's so easy to see ������

How's losses going Boi omg 
@_date: 2018-08-05 03:29:02
Classic... Unable to reply with a logical argument that supports your premise �������� 
Looks like it's going down again too... What a suprise
@_date: 2018-05-11 09:29:19
Back 2 bear market boi gg sell coins
@_date: 2018-06-11 16:10:46
wow, even more accelerating losses.. what a suprise.
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:21:49
For the love of god sell your damn coins. I'm trying to help you here brother; there isn't much time left.
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:55:39
You are so beta dude it makes me cringe
@_date: 2018-06-04 00:33:33
sell coins dog
@_date: 2018-06-04 01:30:22
Stock portfolio says otherwise. Bubble has burst; you're deluded. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 08:02:51
How's losses going
@_date: 2018-06-04 02:12:07
I legitimately feel sorry for you. I can almost guarantee that you're most likely a beta libtard as well ������. I can smell your obesity and body odour from here. Go home brother.
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:06:56
Do you actually believe it's going to go back up? Serious question
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:43:41
how's bitcoin losses going bro? hahahahaha
@_date: 2018-03-19 12:46:10
HAHAHAHAHAHA are you delusional? Crypto is essentially a network with value derived from number of users; yet these metrics have no integrity? 
Keep on hodling you fool.. Enjoy your loss.
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:10:27
Take off your tin foil hat. BTC is gone bro. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:44:54
Damn right I'm a no coiner... I sold all my coins before this crash and we laugh at delusional schmucks like you. 
You continue to hold bitcoin as it continues to fall. Your net worth is declining every second. You lose. You're one of the many losers here. 
I can guarantee you're just another freak here who's entire cryptocurrency portfolio is less than $2000 USD... And you think you're rich? HAHAHAHHAHAHAHA. Good luck nerd.
@_date: 2018-07-10 12:49:48
Blockchain is the future. These first-stage cryptocurrencies are not. How's losses boi? Sell coins yet? Only smart people would sell coins now while it's worth something. Delusional people would still hold.
@_date: 2018-07-26 12:20:55
So predicting the "30% swing in each direction" is easy for anyone with money or brains? And if I "had any brains" I would be able to outperform some of the brightest/dedicated individuals involved with trading with the most resources at hand? You must be smartest + richest man on the planet and you're clearly not at the mercy of your cognitive bias here.... 
@_date: 2018-07-25 09:05:22
This has happened like 4 times in a row. Quick spike up followed by continued decline. 
I don't understand your rationale here... What are you saying? It means nothing. Big hands and Goldman Sachs fund managers are laughing at retailer 'investors' like you... Watch this begin to decline again...
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:24:28
That's exactly the same as comparing 40 years of average 10% gains per year versus one year ride-up of the dutch tulip bubble though... ARR. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:51:49
omg back to bear market boi how's losses?
@_date: 2018-04-05 06:53:51
How's even more bitcoin losses going bro? hahhahahahaahaha

@_date: 2018-04-05 12:53:31
