no one can give you THE answer, except THE God.
If you love bitcoin, buy now.
If you do not love it, keep away.

very sorry to hear that

My friend, I live in China now. There are many people interested in bitcoin in China. However, everyone try to learn it just in order to make profit, no exception.
You see, generally we can say chinese do not have soul, and you can find 99.99% christian here do not trust God in their heart.
Ok, I seem cynical. But it's the truth.
ps: I believe in bitcoin because I am cynical.

My friend, I heard that " normal wire transfers arent currently being processed."
However, My issue is "I can not submit internation wire transfer to my bank account in Hongkong"

as for me, the price of 212 seems very low considering the development during last 6 months.
it should have been 300 or 400 bucks, which is a fairer price bitcoin deserves.
@_date: 2013-10-18 02:15:49
now we can watch the price carefully.
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:08:48
yes you are right
