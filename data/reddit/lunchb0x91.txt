I think that he was just using return of investment as an example. The thing is that humans process large numbers logarithmically. For example, think about the difference between 1 and 1 million, it's a pretty large difference right? Now think about the difference between 1 million and 2 million. In our minds it seems like a much smaller difference than between 1 and 1 million, yet there is the same amount of numbers in between both. That is how the logarithmic scale works, it shows the price in how we think of large numbers.

When you send a transaction it send every thing in your wallet. So if you had 100 BTC and you sent 0.01 BTC to another address, 99.99 BTC would get sent back to your own address and 0.01 would get sent to whatever address you sent it to.

It's because people were fed up with the fees and moved to a working solution.

@_date: 2016-05-20 15:20:58
Yes, that is their choice to include 0 fee transactions. If you disagree and are running a full node, you can choose not to propagate 0 fee transactions. There is simply no need to artificially limit bitcoin, if people think blocks are getting too large they can change their configuration it's very simple.

Miners can filter out low or no fee transactions if they choose too. Keeping block size small forces an economic policy on everyone and governments forcing economic policies on people unwillingly is exactly why bitcoin was created in the first place.

At $300 your only viable option would be the Butterfly Labs 5Gh/s miner. Unfortunately, BFL is backed up on pre-orders still and you would be lucky if you got it by september and by then the difficulty could be high enough that it may not be worth it. In the end, mining is a gamble and you have to ask yourself whether or not you want to gamble your time and money on it.

Back when the weusecoins video was made, Bitcoin was being targeted at people who would be interested in mining, in order to grow the network. So it makes sense that that video focused on it, but now we have plenty of miners and videos describing Bitcoin should focus more on the general public and just briefly describe mining. So, this video is defiantly a good update to the weusecoins one. 
Although, personally, I think it would be better if it talks about Bitcoin interms of mBTC rather than BTC because that is most likely what new users will be dealing with.

While this is obviously bad in the short term, I believe that the silk road being shut down could potentially be a good thing for bitcoin in the long term. One of the arguments that people have against bitcoin is that it is only used to buy illegal goods and that is why the price is high.

This happened to me a while ago, I had too many chrome extensions installed and one of them modified the javascript to blockchain.info and was able to get my password and steal 2 BTC from me. Of course this was back when 1 btc was worth $10, so the loss wasn't so bad back then, but I do wish I still had those 2 btc now.
Also, the guy who stole my BTC spent them all on satoshi dice, so he probably lost them all anyways.

Personally I am not worried about Friedcat, his business is based in bitcoin and it would be against his own interests to hurt it. However, having all that hashing hardware in one place makes me quite nervous. If the Chinese government wanted to destroy bitcoin, they would have a means of doing it simply by seizing AsicMiner's hardware and running a 51% attack.
