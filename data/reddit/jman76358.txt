I told you guys to get them out ASAP.  I got mine out earlier when it wasn't frozen.  The only reason it's frozen is because there's a mass exodus of withdraws and they dont wanna die so they have to force customers to stay with them.  It's like they released a few hostages but are some still keeping some.  Don't worry we'll rescue you eventually.   It might be a few years though

They are forcing us to buy shares in their failing company with a bad reputation, what could go wrong?

@_date: 2016-08-07 07:46:04
Probably an inside job but at this point we don't have much of an option other than complying with the criminals orders.  As much as it sucks to just go along with this, if you have any skin in the game you just want the most money back in the shortest time possible and unfortunately this is the route to take.  Lawsuit will be very long and will bankrupt the company and you may never see a penny.

I guess failure is subjective here, in my opinion it would be somewhat of a failure to not do your part and just buy $1 worth of BFX at the very least.  If the positions were switched I would prob buy a little bit of BFX just to see what happen and to show support for the victims.  Plus you never know if some whales are feeling sympathetic and decide to buy up a ton of them which could spark a bull run and you just never know.  I wouldn't call it a charity considering it can be profited from. 
I think people underestimate the exchanges and the importance they hold.  When they go under we all go under.  I literally just put my money on the exchange to convert to USD and cash out and in that moment I was unlucky enough to get my money stolen.  If we can't trust exchanges for even 5 minutes to make a quick swap then that's not good for the future of crypto.
I do think in years to come this exchange issue will be solved though.  I think Polo is gonna be hit next with a big hack like this and people are finally gonna realize trading these coins in high volume is no longer safe.  Not sure what the solution is, some say decentralized exchanges, I don't know but I do know something needs to change.

A lot of people don't actually believe it was a hack.  It was likely Bitfinex themselves like with Mt. Gox.  So yeah were kicking the people who robbed us and made it seem like they are the victims.  Their lack of transparency and details is frustrating to say the least.  And don't tell me Zane has been transparent.  He dodged every good question and answered every softball question.

How would you have handled the situation at Bitfinex if you were in charge?
@_date: 2016-08-15 16:00:48
True but you aren't technically breaking the law of tax evasion this way.  Plus free shipping and gaining a rising commodity. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 18:18:46
Coinbase is very shady, don't let this AMA make you think they are transparent.  They will not answer tough questions properly.  They are basically Bitfinex under a different name.  When you think coinbase you think centralization, corrupt bankster funded, etc. 
They got big balls coming here acting like they aren't shady af.  
@_date: 2016-08-11 07:51:34
50/50 gold/bitcoin is the way to go.  Hope is not lost for Bitcoin though.  If anything this strengthens the community because now more people (including me) understand the importance of keeping bitcoin off exchanges and in offline wallets, resulting in less devestating hacks.  This shitfinex situation was a much needed wake up call to all exchange trading.  We don't need online wallets and centralized exchanges.
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:53:27
Don't you have something better to do than harass victims of theft?  You just said this thread was stupid. You said these questions above are stupid.  So go ahead, explain how the above questions are stupid I'll be waiting. 
P.S. how much is bitfinex paying you to attack critics of their operation?

Really sucks.  I knew there was a chance something like this would happen again and soon but honestly I really didn't believe hours after opening up it would happen, although I guess the mass withdraws are a factor here.  Biggest mess since Gox.  Sad.

Can't prove it and it's our best option we have so far.  Sueing won't help us anytime soon and the returns may be a lot less than this.  I'm not patient enough to wait up to 5 years for a lawsuit to finalize but I do understand where you're coming from.  We see what happened with Gox where a lawsuit might feel good but for the creditors it's not good.

@_date: 2016-08-07 03:23:03
Yep.  Get used to our money being gone, at least for a long time.  I wouldn't bank on getting it, if any back.  Bitfinex could claim tomorrow that plans have changed because they are getting sued and it could take months to years to ever see a penny of that "hacked" money.  I don't really believe the narrative they are pushing.  120k bitcoin in the top USD-BTC exchange in the world is getting stored where no one who doesn't already have access to will get.  It's getting real suspicious at this point....The "hacker" getting past the withdraw limit and every single security measure Bitfinex had...all that bitcoin withdrawn in such short of a time and no alarms went off.... That hacker would have to be the NSA or Bitfinex themselves.... hard to believe a hacker could be that skilled without access to government technology or being an inside job.
When someone gets hacked what's the first thing they do? They make as many details as they can public as soon as possible so they can use the publics power to help the catch the hacker to potentially return the money.  Did Bitfinex do this?  Well they say they are trying but I don't really believe they ever had intentions of returning money from this "elite hacker" because there is no hacker.....
@_date: 2016-08-07 01:23:40
Doesn't matter because all it takes is 1 person to disagree with this and sue.  They are getting sued regardless of what anyone thinks.  One of the biggest thefts in history, obviously someones getting sued.

 Here's the easy way that works just as good.  Pay attention to bitcoin news.  Good news = buy; Bad news = sell; No news = dont matter.
That's literally all there is to predicting market mood.
@_date: 2016-08-06 05:57:32
No I don't think they would..........  But you cannot convict them based on speculation.  There is NO hard evidence to suggest it was an inside job, but that doesn't mean it wasn't....

Or is that still worse than the loss socialization ?  Not sure exactly what "creditors take control" entails, especially with lawsuits involved.  Wonder how long we would have to wait to get our money back that route and how much we would get back.

Do you have an estimation of how much that number should be?

@_date: 2016-08-07 07:03:39
The alternative to helping out the hack victims (while potentailly profiting yourself) is a failure in the crypto community.  We need exchanges and we need them to be protected from this.  How do you think coins are bought and sold?  Localbitcoins and ATM's are the only other 2 options and if you aren't in the right area you can't use either.  Failing to make whole with the losses will result in lost confidence in crypto and people exiting the community for good, not to mention the reputation damage that will push away some big investors and new users in general.

@_date: 2016-08-21 20:10:54
the software is fine but the coin is ehhh and the devs love to sell their coins which slows growth for investors.  They don't even hide the fact that they dump millions of coins for their own benefits they admitted it on twitter.
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:13:51
They aren't including ANY of their assets to offset the losses.  They are pushing all the losses on us.  He admitted it himself when he got pressured on that question he kept repeating that the finex shares aka the token is what their giving us instead of putting up their own money to offsets some or all costs of the loss.
@_date: 2016-08-08 05:27:11
That's what im thinking looking at this post.  The rest of us knew how much we were getting days ago when the 36% loss was announced.  This guy is acting like its breaking news

That's good to hear.  Not sure why mine got cancled but im sending it through another time hopefully it works...
@_date: 2016-08-07 08:11:03
And reward the victims yeah.  After everyone is fully compensated we can stop using Bitfinex exchange.
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:16:50
The important part is it could simultaneously make people profits while also getting the victims some losses back.  If you jump right into BFX when its ready to be traded, and others are thinking the same thing, if you get in early enough you can make money and feel good that you are helping hacked victims who i assure you have learned a big lesson from this whether they get the loss back or not.
@_date: 2016-08-07 22:48:36
You're probably right.  Why else would they be holding back the information about their financial situation?  Because they probably can afford it and if their user base ever figures that out it's GG.
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:53:19
Exactly.  They probably aren't involved so we are stuck with 2 choices. Lengthy costly lawsuit or this method that could actually work.  
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:07:32

I don't need a verified source to add 2 and 2.  Anyone who isn't insane would do the same in his case, it just isn't safe to remain in the same location in a situation where you are responsible for 64 million missing even if you do plan on eventually repaying it. 
I will remain optimistic about everything as long as bitfinex is keeping us updated and releasing more news.  They just released settlement prices and have stated officially they are trying to get our accounts back to atleast look at our balances.
The way it's going so far is a good sign.  Let's just remain calm and trust bitfinex for now.  Keywords: for now
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:53:07
7eleven did not promise to secure the car in the parking lot.  Bitfinex promised to secure our money.  It's really that simple and there is a high chance that this was an inside job.  No one stores 70 million in a place that isn't 110% secure.  Bitfinex's founder praised a ponzi scheme CEO that went to jail for 18 months because of it and were supposed to think they are moral people who we can trust and believe?  No... Bitfinex's reputation is irreversibly harmed.

Do not use coinbase EVER it's a giant fraud, we literally get complaints here non-stop from people getting screwed by coinbase or for their incredibly slow customer support (sometimes 10 days) for a generic answer.  Use bitcoin atm's or localbitcoins if you can, those are the best methods in my opinion.
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:31:02
Zane isn't giving us enough details and answering questions related to how they came up with the calculations to reach 36% when most calculations people are getting show it should be a lot lower.

@_date: 2016-08-07 01:13:22
They would have to give everyone customer atleast a 10% profit after repaying everyone completely in order to gain SOME trust back.  You can't just hold our money for a long time involuntarily and give it back without adding interest.  Sure i'll be satisfied with getting 100% of my money back in a reasonable time frame, but I would be much more satisfied making some money off this involuntary 'loan' because of all the trading im missing out on.  I would of made a lot more money trading over the past few days if i had access to my funds so 10% profit on top of my money would be required to gain SOME of my trust back.  I doubt this will happen in the time frame I would expect so Bitfinex is dead to me.

But if the amount of money you are making off transaction fee's is less than profitable for the amount of hardware you need, why would anyone mine it?  if more people hopped in to bring the price down, then it wouldn't work because the price would need to come up in order to make it profitable.  the only reason it's profitable now is because they can mine it without having to pass ALL of the cost onto the users.  Right?

Remember when Trump ended her statement with "because you'd be in jail" in the debate with Hillary and the crowd went wild?  No one else does that shit but Trump.  He always got the last word in on shit like that.  That's how he beat all the other republicans in the primaries.
@_date: 2018-07-23 06:02:43
He's probably going to get re-elected because the Democrats so far have no one who can debate Trump.  He rekt every other republican politician including Hillary in the debates because he's a showman used to being on stage and doing this type of thing.  The rest of them we're scripted politicians who can't "freestyle".  So unless the Dems get someone who can counter that style of debating they are screwed.  It's like putting a boxer in a UFC cage match.  UFC fighter going to always win because the structured boxer isn't used to getting spin kicked.
