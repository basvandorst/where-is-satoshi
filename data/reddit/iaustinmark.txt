Is that because every lap takes a detour via THE MOON!

Wrong site mate, I can suggest alternatives.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:17:15
Even if the initial price is $10Billion?
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:45:01
Terrific I live in England fantastic!

I disagree, my parents were this way and as a result I had little to no idea about earning, saving and investing until it was almost too late They have absolutely no idea about investing. If they had spoken about it they would have found information about investing and would be sitting on a much healthier retirement fund.

Okay, where are the Tesla pipes then?

If you can see that it has stagnated, you're probably too late.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:46:08
I don't think we'll start to see sustained stabilisation until we have the full 21 million coins in circulation, after that we could see the price become a lot less volatile.

He should be the one leaving her! Code ninja I bought at 5.5, hmu!
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:24:40
It ended far too soon am I right?

I like you're positivity but I must say I'm not a fan of this mentality. None of us have any idea where this is going to be in a year or two and making statements like this has the potential to encourage people to invest more than they can afford to lose.
You could lose everything tomorrrow, it's a gamble.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:31:07
I too check the value of my investments regularly.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:26:49
I don't think it's fair to say education is a waste of money. Hindsight is a great thing, I too could have invested my tuition into bitcoin back when it was worthless but it could have crashed the next day. For me the risk/return of getting an engineering degree and earning better salary for the rest of my life is a much better gamble.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:29:47
They would do what people do now and buy what they can afford. Even at $100,000 you'd still be able to get 1000 Satoshis for a dollar
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:14:36
So $10,000 became $10000? That sounds absolutely devastating!
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:58:42
Do you mean that 1 satoshi is 0.00000001 BTC? For someone that just bough 0.5BTC you seem a bit unsure how this all works.
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:06:50
Everyone checks the price themselves, we don't really need one thread on this let alone multiple. I wouldn't let it get to you too much, see if you can come up with some original content.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:40:11
Are you a part of the buy high, sell low movement?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:59:41
I like bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:16:05
How have you lost out? If you hold on to what you bought in the dip you should go positive at some point. Did you sell later into the dip?
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:24:01
If it follows this years trend for the foreseeable future I think the world will implode
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:31:49
That's such a typical Satoshi thing to say.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:31:28
What's the difference?
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:39:27
Great story but it has absolutely nothing to do with what you commented on...
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:12:45
Makes more sense to give as much as he can afford, you've just undercut the charity by 0.143 of a BTC for the sake of "meaning something"
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:37:41
Yes it is, both ways you make the same ROI, if you have $7000 to invest and you invest at $700 and sell at $800 you now have $8000. 
If you invest $7000 at $7000 and sell at $8000 you also have $8000.
I won't bore you with the workings but some quick calculus gives us $8000 = $8000 and therefore I conclude a 10% profit on a fixed investment amount is equal regardless of actual price.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:05:14
Nobody knew that back then and nobody knows that will continue to be true into the future. Everyone has the intention of cashing out at some point otherwise what's the point, it's just whether you're lucky enough to hit the final peak.

I think what he's saying is to hold what you can whilst spending whenever possible to increase the value of what you're holding.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:08:43
We need to start referring to Satoshis, they much easier to comprehend at tiny amounts and make you feel like you have an actual quantity of something. 50 thousand Satoshis sounds a lot more positive than 0.0005BTC
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:00:24
If it's just money then people shouldn't be concerned about it being returned to them, right?
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:26:44
He knows nothing, same as all of us. It could be worth nothing tomorrow
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:28:20
There is no right way in trading. If you had waited for a drop you might have never bought in
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:35:35
Let's just wait and see
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:00:35
It makes sense after seeing it rise past 9600 they were probably feeling like they missed an opportunity, when it came back around it probably felt better than the first time. Stop being such a negative Nancy and be happy for people joining the train.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:45:12
Bet he's glad the police got there first

If you want convincing that you're gonna be rich, you're in the right place, if you want some serious advice the answer is no one knows, absolutely no one has any idea what bitcoin will do in the next 5 seconds let alone 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:44:45
I have no money and no issues with status. Don't blame the money.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:27:47
I know worst timing possible, waiting for the correction, here it is and I can't buy shit

It's a message sent in November 2011 saying that the price had crashed down from $20 and will probably never return to that height.
