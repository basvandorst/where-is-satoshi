They don’t insure all of the assets. Only the ones that are not in cold storage. Approximately 3% is insured. Better hope that there is no catastrophic failure with their cold storage plan. If you don’t hold your keys. You don’t hold your bitcoin.

No but ppl asked WTF I was laughing at. 
@_date: 2018-08-05 02:27:07
Ha. That shit made me laugh out loud in public on accident.

Ha. Yes. Withdrawal is life or death.

This guy received the first BTC transaction. He also has may public emails with Satoshi before live launch. He isn’t young. [Hal Finney ](
But yes. I agree. Most people who nurtured it were younger.

I referenced the original Cypher punk group, along with their age. I am well aware they were not 19 years old dude. I meant once it expanded beyond the OGs and developers it was likely young people who embraced it quicker than and older population. No need to be a dick.

Price drops. But the quantity of BTC on a transfer remains constant. Minus fees.

PR only applies if the gains were realize once you have moved there and established you legal  resistance aka residence there. All gains prior to being a legal resident there will be taxed at your home state rate and US rate. (Yes I was ready to go too).

In the US spending crypto that had appreciated is a taxable event. You are “selling” crypto to buy an item even if it goes from your account to the Lambo dealer. It’s being “sold” at market value and that’s taxed at the appreciated rate.

I 100% agree on small purchases. 
If you buy a house cash you will have to report where the income originated from. The banks/mortgage companies  and Government have mandatory reporting requirements for large currencies transactions. Unfortunately this BS will likely apply to Crypto too.  We’ll be getting screwed all around.

So basically the sender “kept the change?”

How long did that cash wire take?

Jesus People. BITCOIN WAS THE SOLUTION TO THE HYPER INFLATION EXAMPLES.

According to this article : [Coinbase insurance ](  Coinbase insures .009% of their assets. So, if your BTC Is in cold storage and 1% of their BTC is stolen by an insider then you may be out of luck if their profit margin or insurance can’t cover it.  So why risk it when you can have a cold storage device for 80 dollars?
Then you have the issue of SIM card swapping and a hacker draining your coinbase account [Sim Card Swap]( 
Overall most experts preach that keeping your BTC on an exchange is the single most risky long term decision one can make in the space. If you don’t believe me, please feel free to leave it there. Eventually someone will take it. It may take 500 years or it may happen tomorrow. Don’t take my word for it. Post a question on the sub. “Is it safe to leave my BTC on the exchanges long term?”

Congrats. You are on the no fly list now.

I can’t figure out how far off the ground they were. 6 feet?

The bitcoin podcast?
@_date: 2019-08-01 01:31:38
Correct. When they have their BTC on an exchange they are taking the calculated risk that they may lose it in a hack. That is why you see giant levels of BTC move into and out of cold storage. Just ask those who used MT GOX as a storage facility. Keeping the majority of ones BTC off the exchanges is the safest way to store the asset.

I agree 100% with the hardware wallet. I am glad you use one. 
Insurance only covers what you pay for., and elect to cover. The article says that coinbase only carries insurance to cover losses of 225 million. So yes, their insurance will not pay for a 500 million dollar loss if their not paying a premium to cover said losses. Just like my car insurance for my Honda won’t replace a lambo. Insurance is a business based on calculated risks.

Nothing like signing a Non Disclosure Agreement to access your own personal information. What a joke.

It’s always that pesky tax man.

Is that a nod to Hal Finney?

Damn. That was a crazy explanation of banks and loans. Thx for that link. Any other good resources? I’ve been into Crypto for a while, but only recently doing a deep dive into the Fed and banking systems. They are truly fucked.
