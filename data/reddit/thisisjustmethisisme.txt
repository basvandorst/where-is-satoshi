The value on the market may get smaller extremely. but you would still have the house for yourself and you would get the benefits of saving rent etc. 
But anyway, I agree a bit in america... in germany we have an extremely save social security net, the securities you have to bring to get a mortage are very high and you need to insure anything... thats why the crisis 2008 didn't realy hit us that hard.

true, a realy good and extremely important rule. People need to understand that BTC are an investment... not some insurance or a retirement SAVING. Its just speculation... nobody should put any money into it, that they cant afford to lose...

No this is not correct and can't be compared. Usually (at least in germany) you even HAVE to make a insurance for your ability to work. If you ever happen to not be able to do your current job, than the insurance kicks in and you can keep your house. The bank also has to make sure (by law) that you insure the house itself and that you insure your family in case of death of a income-earner in the family.
Also: land and homes will ALWAYS have values. It may change, but it will not change THAT drastically. Bitcoin is pure speculation.

Well, but you didn't sold them yet so you didn't actualy earned anything until now and you may still loose everything. (just saying ;-) its interesting if people compare a speculative investment with a secure 401k)

My guess is, even in america retirement fonds are much more conservative and safer than BTC, wouldn't you say?
However, in germany you have 100% guarantee on every penny you put in, even fees are paid back by the state in the end. the only thing you can loose is the profit of the market, but since its automaticaly changed to lower risk fonds in your later years, its far less likely. 
However, its ridiculous to compare the safety of a bitcoin-investment with a retirement fond.

yeah I understand that concept. But I was referring to an investment in your OWN house where you actualy can live in. the loss of the value of your house only becomes relevant to you, if you loose your income and cant pay the mortage.

that comparison is just wrong. block chains are limited because we decided in the beginning that its architecture makes sure it is so. not because its real thing.
its also just not real - if we simply decide all thats its nothing, than it basically disapears. a house will still be there, even if the market says its only worth 1/10th of the price you paid for it. you can still live there! you cant use block chain for ANYTHING if the market decides its useless

spending isnt much fun if its worth only 1/10000 of what you invested.
I believe in bitcoin, but its totaly absurd to say that this is anything but speculation.

The thinking for this decision was good. Its like not buying a lottery ticket. If you buy a winning ticket it wasnt a well made decision, it was just pure luck.

Thanks for this in depth reply.
The "blow it into space" was always my first thought of a solution for this problem. Obviously you are right, the risk is high but it is pretty likely, that the risk of space flights will go down significantly with technological advances, like we see from SpaceX. 
But I wonder if the energy that is needed to move the radioactive waste into space will ever be on a level low enough to justify it. If I am not mistaken there is an absolute minimum of energy that is needed to move something out of our atmosphere. 
All in all I think that renewable energy sources are a cheaper and much better option =)

I may just not know that as it its not my field, but is there ANY solution for nuclear waste?

Totaly right. There is an infinite amount of ways I could have become a billionair. Buying lottery tickets, playing in the casino, buying the right stocks... 
Regretting to not buy bitcoins is like regretting to not have gone one of this ways.
