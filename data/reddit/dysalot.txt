You might not be speaking literally, but up until very recently Buffett was against dividend paying stocks, saying that the money would be better reinvested into the company, and up the stock price in that way.

From others I have been told it handles pretty good. But not as good as an AWD vehicle, but better than almost any other 2wd due to the low center of gravity and 50/50 weight distribution. It also has decent traction control systems.

That's why diversification is your best insulation against market fluctuations.

This is a dubious list in my opinion anyways. Most valued currency has no practical meaning. It in no way means one is better than the other, just that the supply is more limited compared to the demand; a worthless comparison.
EDIT: I realize that with currency the supply always equals the demand, and that is how the value is derived. It doesn't change my point. It doesn't show that any country has more purchasing power or even that the country is doing better. You can get a sense of how 2 countries compare by looking at their exchange rate OVER TIME, but a snapshot shows absolutely nothing. The value of a currency is arbitrarily manipulated by the governing country, by deciding how much cash to make available. 
Not all currencies started at a 1:1 value is what I am saying.You can get a snapshot of the relative strength of certain currencies that started at a close to 1:1 ratio such as the USD and the Euro.

That's probably a stretch.

There is some sort of calculator for this, I don't have a link unfortunately.

I just had a withdrawal through Dwolla. It took about 5 days just be patient.

I actually debated something like this in Philosophy. But I think the answer boils down to information cannot be stored at a greater than 1:1 ratio. In the end I think the answer is no, the slightly longer answer it may be possible in theory only.

I have calculated using a [Kill-A-Watt Meter]( and my electricity costs, and calculated that mining is profitable down to $2/BTC.  Though I live in an area with very cheap energy costs.

This will probably not go over well, but I think bitcoins might be building another bubble. The thing with bubbles is it's nearly impossible to tell when it will pop it could raise another $10 before doing so I just don't know.
But I don't see any reason for the value going up as rapidly as it has. I don't think a major player has started accepting bitcoins in the last week to drive up prices. I think bitcoins are probably more popular in the summer, and there may be a yearly uptick in the price (I am not sure about this, just a guess).
But I think at some point in the next few months the price will drop again. What it goes to in the mean time, I don't know.

Used to have Wells Fargo and they were terrible. Moved to a local credit union and haven't looked back.
No fees, 3% interest, open on Saturdays and Sundays... Locations all over town, just not the town I currently live in.

Cities and towns default on their debt often enough, individuals even more, states can default too. That is because none of them are the federal government, and none of them have the right to print money. They issue their own bonds separate of the federal government, they have their own debts separate of the federal government.
He is stating that the U.S. Federal Government will not default. Federal debt is considered separate from individual state debt. Just like a banks debts are considered separate from your own. Just because you default on your mortgage, doesn't mean that the bank defaulted.

Correct but Trump is talking about the federal government. Which is a separate entity from individual states. 
 He's wrong that it can't ever default since three Congress can choose to default instead of increasing debt. But Puerto Rico defaulting has no connection to his statement since the U.S. could bail them out.

They don't produce their own money.
@_date: 2016-05-09 17:36:38
Correct, but they don't have the power to print money. The U.S. does, but they refused to ease up any on Puerto Rico so they defaulted, and they can't produce money to remove the debt.
@_date: 2013-06-07 02:09:42
I don't disagree.

And frankly, everyone with that amount of money should understand how much of their money is actually insured by the banks. In the United States there is the FDIC for banks and only a certain amount is covered, the rest is exposed in the event of a bank failure. It is the same in Europe. These people took a risk and it backfired.
Frankly I would not trust more than the insured amount in any bank, more than that is just silly.

The question is whether it is more accurate to use the M0 money supply (actual cash and coins) or the M2 money supply which includes value from fractional reserve banking, and bonds.

Well, if they were unable to use other exchanges, they would effectively be barred from using Bitcoin at all, blocking them out from the industry they are trying to promote.

He is a scumbag for not agreeing with your investment strategy?
This will be unpopular on this subreddit, but I agree with Munger somewhat on gold. I don't see what intrinsic value gold has over any other finite commodity.
In a truly doomsday scenario where the world financial markets totally collapse, gold will be of little use. People need water and food and possibly guns and ammo. Gold is terrible for any of those means.

Paypal in almost all instances is faster than Bitcoin, especially if you wait for confirmations.

Not a lot, maybe up to $0.50 can account for that. It has been rising for a few weeks now.

Yes people keep their money in checking accounts, but that represents actual cash, theoretically without fractional reserve banking the cash would still be in existence just in the banks hands. M1 and beyond take into account the value of being able to loan up to 10 times the deposits as loans.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:28:02
Just curious, how could you run a fractional exchange without using loans?
I think I could see a way it may work, but it seems like it would add extra risk with no extra benefit.

Legal in Washington and Colorado. I think that's it but still faces being illegal federally in the U.S.

Honestly, speculation isn't great for the health of a currency. Hoarding coins creates an artificial limitation in supply, and people become less comfortable trading (or selling). It's better for the value to grow organically through trading and use rather than hoarding.

They chose merchants for a very specific reason. Because in total transfers or money transferred virtual currency rated services make up much more than 0.1%

Well you are talking theoretical limits. The true upper-bound is probably assuming the whole world adopts bitcoin as their only legal tender. That would be the M0 amount for the world which is about equivalent to $5 trillion. There will be a maximum of 21mil bitcoins. So you divide those and you end up with $238,000/btc.
Again that is assuming the whole world adopts Bitcoin as the sole source of money exchange. That number could vary a bit based on changes to M0 and lost Bitcoins.

I agree Steam would be nice. I could see steam potentially having an issue breaking laws buy selling games to countries that they are banned (or versions of games that are banned). I know it is a good ideal for Australians and Germans to have access to all games, but it might lead to legal trouble for Steam.

Assuming all of that went into his pockets.

Any price of bitcoin in that range would definitely be a bubble. I did a quick analysis awhile back and determined that if all currency was immediately switched to bitcoin (all other currency doesn't exist) each Bitcoin would be worth $238,000 today (assuming 21mil bitcoins and negligible losses). It's not a precise number but it is in the ballpark, and honestly there is no way that Bitcoin would ever even hold 50% market share of all of the world's currency.
@_date: 2013-06-03 17:53:06
I don't see how that changes things.
