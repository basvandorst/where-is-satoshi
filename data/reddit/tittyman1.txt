You’re misunderstanding why people use credit cards, there is a distinct difference between a credit card and a debit card. 
Yes your statement about the fees is correct but people use credit cards to pay for stuff with money they don’t have, it’s the whole point of credit. Think of it like taking out a loan, THAT’s the main factor when it comes to the credit industry. 
So unless bitcoin develops some sort of borrowing system, credit card companies will always be around.

I’m a huge supporter of bitcoin but your statement about credit card companies is extremely ignorant. 
You need to read up on the “credit industry”, it’s much more than simply a form of payment.

Are the odds of finding a block for an individual machine higher in a pool rather than solo?
In other words do the odds of your individual machine finding a block increase in a pool?

The problem with this argument is you assume the US military which is made up of US citizens would comply with killing innocent people. It wouldn’t happen.

Actually I understand it completely. 
OP thinks ownership only exists if it is backed by a government? Kind of embarrassing.

Where did he talk about quantum algorithims?
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:48:36
Lol you’re so emotional. You have some sort of weird obsession with bitcoin, where your only desire is to see something fail. Most likely because you don’t understand it. 
Fuck your regulations fuck your government

Read up on fractional reserve banking. 
Also the FDIC is kind of a joke. If there was an actual massive banking failure they probably couldn’t cover more than 10% of the total money lost.
