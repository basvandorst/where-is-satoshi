Actually if you only change 1 variable (the price) then the Satoshi per byte price would increase not decrease.

Yawn. Easy come. Easy go. Wake me up when we see a crash like the one from $30. Let the price settle back down at $2k let it brew in people's minds for a few month or a year two and we will have another ATH. This run up was insane but as long as the miners keep on mining, the developers keep on developing and the hodler keep on hodling we are not done here yet.
@_date: 2018-01-14 03:07:32
Jesus. Pure socialism is crap. Pure capitalism is crap. Do you think hard extreme political ideas are the best way forward? 
A flexible ecosystem would be far more resilient and decentralised than a hard locked down system ever would be. 
I am hodling on to all of my forks because I see Bitcoin as a network of chains. This way we can stay on top of cryptocurrency innovations brought in by altcoins without risking the main chains security.
Bitcoin Cash will fork again. The mainchain will fork again. One of those forms may make what we currently have obselete on decentralisation, usability, divisibility, speed, anonymity. Bitcoin is too young to stop changing right now and the safest way to adopt changes is through open source projects that fork off the main chain. If they have terrible security you still have your main chain coin. If they bring amazing features and usability you still benefit from the added functionality in the bitcoin ecosystem without having to buy into an ICO. I can not see why anyone is complaining about forks when we all got an equal share of the new ledger.

Mate honestly. You have to be very very careful. Reading through your Reddit history it is blindingly obvious you are not smart. At all. I know it must suck to be in this situation but mate you lost the brain lottery hard. 
Try to avoid things that confuse you and just stick to the basics. Basic job where you are told what to do, basic savings account where you have no control over your portfolio etc. 
Do not try to invest or try to start your own business. You don't have the capacity for that. You can definitely get by just fine and live a happy life if you don't take on any risk.
Honestly sorry if this is rude but I feel it's better you hear it.

Why do we need to hold on to decade old transactions? Can't a Blockchain purge 100 year old transactions? At 20,000 tx per second at 250 bytes per transaction the Blockchain would be 14k terabytes and would hold a century worth of transactions. Is that impossible to store?

Bingo. The whole point a was to explain the difference between hoarding cash and hoarding Bitcoin.
Bitcoin that is being hoarded can either be in a bank just like money or point 2 in a private wallet where it will not be devaluated by inflation of 1-2% every year.

Because if you wanted to buy 144,000 bitcoins you would not find enough at the current market price. You would find 1000 people willing to sell at $230-300, 1000 people at $400-500 and so on until you wouldn't be able to find a person that would sell to you for less then $1,000. Also people would see the price shooting up quickly and increase their asking prices.
I assume $600 was the average expected price.

Exactly for every $1000 you have in your bank the bank holds less than 5%. The rest is loaned out to businesses and mortgages. Those businesses than use the loan to pay their employees who again deposit the cash into their bank accounts and only 5% is held and the rest loaned. 
This goes on and on until the $1,000 you held is now held by a hundred people who in total believe they are holding $20,000. Fractional reserve banking creates more dollars than central banks.
5% is an average figure in reality the reserves very from 10-0%

Using the link you sent me it looks like my experience is the norm. $0.20 to $0.25 is currently enough to get through bringing bitcoin on par with most debit/credit card transaction fees for $10 purchases (based on 2-3% hidden or public bank fees). For transactions over $10 dollars bitcoin is still far cheaper. 
I want the blocks to increase too because I don't think the current level of transactions per minute can be justified but for now all 90,000 people who are stuck brought it into themselves to save 5-10 cents.

That's my thought exactly. Also people are numerous times more likely to decide not to pay for a particular month, longer periods of time or even stop all together.

After its initial release Bitcoin had a limit placed on the amount of transactions it can process to stop spam. The limit was set to 1mb per 10 minutes. Which works out to around 7 transactions per second. 
Recently people have been discussing how we can expand Bitcoin now that it is more popular and what possible method we should use. 
There is a group of developers who we refer to as the Core team who have been leading the development of Bitcoin over the last few years and they believe that we should not be changing Bitcoin's rules because it sets the wrong example for the future. 
There are opposing groups one of which is called Classic which wants to increase the Bitcoin limit to 2mb now until a better solution is found.
The Core team moderates this subreddit.

Even if BU is broken I will have my BC and everyone will move back. If BC clogs up and chokes to death everyone will eventually move to BU. 
1 of them will be the king of crypto and inherit the name so I am keeping both. Where else will you put your money if the chain you don't like survives? Ether? A bank? The stock market?

I have read it. The economic incentive comes from the fact that Bitcoin is not worth anything if there is no demand for it. So although miners can decide what they do with their hashrate, if users don't like it the price drops and their mining equipment becomes useless.
@_date: 2017-03-19 11:47:17
I don't think you have any idea what you are taking about. You are comparing a resistor which is just a core made of 1 material, without any complicated micro pattern, that doesn't require highly accurate equipment to produce, and is essentially a thicker wire covered in plastic coating to a mining chip that can process 2kWh of energy? It's like comparing a filament lightbulb to an 8k TV their  a prices will never be the same. Even a black and white display that can produce as much light as a 100w lightbulb is still more expensive.
Than you are saying this will somehow be so cheap that there will be mass adoption by general bitcoin users and they will get a few satoshis back. So let's say this takes another 3 years to implement. We have another halvening in 2020. So every hour we will get 36 coins, that 3.6 billion satoshis. 
The cost for 2kwh in my area currently costs around $0.60. In order for me to even get 1 cent back I would need to be 1 out of no more than 3,600,000 miners running the same hardware as me. Any more than that I don't even get 1 cent per hour.
If you believe these things will cost as much as a general 2kw heater your network would get blown away by simple CPU mining and 51% attacked for a joke. Even if you somehow can mine on general hardware what stops people from joining pools? Pools which again would be controlled by a few people? What would stop miners from investing 36,000,000 to buy as many of these heaters as there are in the world and 51% attacking the coin?

If you want mass adoption your reward would be less than 1 cent.
Any financial sound person would buy the toaster for $35 instead of the toaster for $40 with the chip, and $5 worth of scratch cards.
If the chips only cost $5 you will end up with mining farms just like now.
You are depending on people buying in on a mining lottery which yields less than 1 cent for every 60 cents of electricity you burn to run the network, a network that most people won't even know anything about or be able to use. And these mass adopters will also have to set it up to connect to their WiFi, remember passwords etc... The chips will get more efficient with time and old toasters will yield even less than "not even 1 cent an hour".
If you think this is a viable idea be my guest. The level pseudoscience is right up there with solar freaking roadways and self filling water bottles. 
Edit: I give up, you must be trolling me.

Segwit will allow us to fit a few more transactions in the current block size.
It's like having a car. You can fit 5 people inside. To get more people in you can either make the car bigger or take out the seats so you can fit more people within the same car frame.
Obviously there is a limit on how many people you can squeeze in a car before some are left outside because they don't want to pay for the ride.
So the Segwit devs want to construct railways (lightening network). To use the railway you will just have to travel to the nearest train station and then take the train to go meet your friends. However if your friend is not at a train station they will have to drive to a train station too.
Once you have met and exchanged coins you can either stay in the train station to trade with others or decide you want to go back to your home. 
The train company won't charge you to go up and down the trains but will charge you a fee based on how long you spend there.
In the end once you are done for good you and your friend will again need cars to get back home.

I am not sure if you know what your point is. It doesn't matter if both resources are limited if the limits are different.
A stadium with 1,000 seats and 1,200 rich fans where bidding dictates the price will sell seats for extremely high prices but a stadium with 10,000 seats and 1,200 rich fans will sell 1,200 seats at the minimum bidding price. 
Both have a limit, both have the same demand but 1 will make $12 per match (1,200 seats at 1 cent each) and the other will easily turnover $100,000 (1,000 seats at $100 per seat).

I don't think altcoins are the same as a hard fork. For 1 a fork does not depend on an ICO. It is more of a branch of the Bitcoin tree. BCH may fork again and the current BTC chain will almost certainly fork a few more times. 
My initial bitcoin holdings will be divided across all those branches as I am not trading. Some of those branches may eventually come up with a breakthrough in cryptocurrency that makes mass adoption flawless.
If all altcoins had been introduced as hard forks from the bitcoin blockchain a person holding 1 bitcoin in 2011 would now have a share in the whole cryptomarket. That is a far more appealing ecosystem to me then the current ICO scam market where coins can be premined and developers can cashout before they even release any working code (tezos).

We now have new functionality from the high blocksize chain, the security that we always had on the original chain, segwit which will help bring lighting networks to life, a potential 3rd fork with Segwit and larger blocks... Who needs altcoins? Bitcoin needs to fork to satisfy all potential cryptocurrency needs.

That won't happen. I suspect in 5 years time we will be looking at a bitcoin that resembles more of a tree than a single chain. Certain branches will be used as store of value, others for buying coffee and others for the dozens of features we were promised like smart contracts. 
No altcoins or scamy ICOs needed and Bitcoin holders get a share of all the innovations that continue to come. Why would you not want this?

The chain that got 93% of the vote will be called bitcoin. The chains that had sub 50% of the vote can be called Bitcoin X, Bitcoin Y etc. Soon we will have Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Legacy. 
I will not be selling any of them. One day an updated Bitcoin fork may turn out to be so much better that it makes the biggest difference to our economy and that fork could come out from any one of the current chains.
I truly hope that it comes from a bitcoin branch.

We have these forks because a $60 billion market can not be satisfied by a single set of rules. We can't buy coffee and save for retirement in the same blockchain but we want to buy coffee and save for retirement with decentralised real money. 
Bitcoin needs to solve lots of issues and perhaps multiple hard forks will create an ecosystem of far greater functionality for all our purposes.

5%? There is no way you can sell 191 coins during a flash crash without crashing the price further. That's how you sell at a 30% loss before the price shoots up again 20% in 5 minutes. Besides what are the chances that from the moment you buy the price will not dip 5% before going up 100%?

Nodes have to identify coins in the Blockchain to determine if the coins being spent are actually still in the address or if they have already been spent. All that would change is you would tell nodes to only look at the last 120 years. If the transaction being suggested is not in the latest 120 years worth of blocks they never existed. If anything it would be less work on the nodes and it would mean nodes would not always have to have a full copy of all old transactions just the latest 120 years.

From the day you buy bitcoin there is currently only 1 thing you need to do if you don't want to lose it forever and that is set up a plan for inheritance. 
All this change would require you to do is to add a reminder to your plan informing your grandchildren to refresh the coins after you die.
If we set the limit to 200 years we can assume no one person who bought bitcoin would ever have to perform any active maintenance ever unless they inherited a 200 year old paper wallet.

That last point you made is were we really disagree. If there is no point to bring back coins that were lost in error than what was the point of creating them in the first place? Are the bitcoins that we are mining right now being mined for no reason? If 12.5 coins are mined right now and lost in the first transaction what purpose did they serve? 
Also are these grandchildren of yours capable of making 1 transaction every century or 2 or are they incapable of doing that? It's a basic "Is anybody who even cares there" test.
@_date: 2019-06-01 20:58:41
I was talking specifically about any currency we design today.
@_date: 2019-06-01 02:27:23
I get this point the most but you are the first one to mention it. 
The real threat is changing anything about Bitcoin could open up the code to manipulation by bad actors. So the best strength Bitcoin could guarantee is that it is never changing and thus timetested.
If we change this now then in 10 years they will change something else and in another 30 years they will change everything. I completely agree with that as a threat.
The alternative is we change nothing and in 200 years there are only 5 million coins divisible to .0000000000000001 and the world keeps ticking with Bitcoin being this strange ever stable trust machine.


Again I don't think I have heard a reason why it is a bad idea in itself but I do agree it is obviously a threat to a slippery slope into manipulation of the whole project.
@_date: 2019-06-06 07:22:22
USD and BTC are 2 seperate Pizzas. The number of slices you have is the amount of pizza you have. With USD every year the fed cuts up more pizza slices, but the pizza is not growing so essentially they are cutting up slices from your own share. You still have the same number of slices of USD but they are a smaller and smaller in size each year. The same happens in BTC however less and less new slices are being cut every 4 years so your slices do not get smaller over time. 
The problem is one pizza is Pepperoni and the other is Veggie Supreme. You might have a large share of the Pepperoni but if public consensus says they like Veggie Supreme more than your slices can go up and down in value by more than the difference in inflation.

Just because a lease on a property expires in 250 years it doesn't mean it is worth much less than a lease that never expires. You can see this with properties. The prices only really start to fall when leases drop to below 80-100 years and people consider that their kids or grandkids might be effected. The decrease in value goes down immediately when a property lease is renewed for 125 years and the big difference is that with bitcoin renewing a lease would only require 1 transaction fee.

Because there is 0% chance that fiat will go through hyper inflation and your family is broke in 50-100 years. The correct answer is you diversify into fiat, commodities, land and stocks in large steady corporations. I would also keep at least 10% in Bitcoin by that point. No way am I giving up something that made me a billionaire completely.

Or just make it public knowledge that if you inherited a paper wallet from your great grandfather you should probably refresh it by sending it to a new address once in 100 or so years. Basic competence, much easier to understand than most things about Bitcoin. I was hoping people would come up with actual faults and I could play devils advocate.
For example I mentioned there is an incentive for miners to reject 119 year old transactions. Are there any other issues this creates?
@_date: 2019-06-30 07:52:43

Good point, I was thinking of the potential for a government like entity losing the bottom lines of their reservers because they had not been in deficit for 100+ years and only moved bitcoins in a LIFO pattern.

HODLers wouldn't be paying for the transactions. They would just stop receiving an every bigger share of lost coins but like others said it makes sense for the lost value to go to all stakeholders instead of just miners.
As for the transactions costing money I do think that is a thing of the last century that will become unacceptable sooner or later. Someone will figure out a fee less, inflation less, deflation less currency sooner or later.

@_date: 2019-06-01 02:18:26
If you lose your coins today the fact that they would come back to miners after a century wouldn't mean you will get anything back in your lifetime. You would have still lost your coins today and you will never see them again. I don't see why you would care any less about devs giving you bad code that made you lose your assets.
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:51:35
Nobody in the main chain needs to switch anything. They already have a share of all new coins. If you don't want to use the other chains you don't need to. You don't need to trade between forks. If you need smart contracts you can use your smart bitcoins if you don't need smart contracts you don't need to use your smart contract bitcoins. If you want to transact fast for cheap but less securely you can send your 1gb per block coins to buy coffee if you need to transact more securely to hodl your life savings you can buy some secure mainchain bitcoin.

In a fork isn't the combined marketcap of the 2 branches equal to the marketcap of the first branch? I personally like the idea of anyone and everyone starting their own forks as long as they are distributing them equally amongst original BTC owners and not giving themselves extra coins. This way by owning Bitcoin you can benefit from all the forks that bring with them innovation without risking the security of the original ledger. It is also a much better scenario for Bitcoin owners than altcoins being created all the time. If an altcoin comes out with a new feature that could threaten Bitcoins dominance we could copy it 1:1 but distribute the coins equally amongst current Bitcoin owners. We could already have Bitcoin Ethereum, Bitcoin Monero, Bitcoin DASH etc. That creates a Bitcoin ecosystem that is almost impossible to beat while making the parent Bitcoin impossible to out innovate.

@_date: 2017-11-26 12:40:29
Well say you want to buy something that is $10 you send 1.1 thousands of a bitcoins (0.0011 Bitcoin)
A 1 thousandth of a bitcoin is an mbtc, a 1 millionth of a bitcoin is a bit.
A 1 hundred of a Satoshi is a bit.
100 Satoshi = 1 bit = $0.009 or almost 1¢
1000 bits = 1mbtc = $9
1000mbtc = 1 bitcoin = $9000
1 bitcoin = 100 million Satoshi.
The price has increased so much that really we should be using 1mbtc or 1bit as the standard in all prices.

It would not work. Within a year your unit would be useless. The more miners buy these units the less profitable mining will become until mining is done at an expense. 
Gas is far cheaper than electricity for heating. Mining would be so unprofitable that it wouldn't even compete with gas heaters. People would not update their units.
Unit costs would not be recovered and it would make better financial sense to buy a $50 electric heater or a $1000 gas boiler.

You make a very good point. Why should more value go to miners instead of being spread out evenly across all stakeholders instantly just by supply and demand. 
I guess I am trying to combat the natural effect of deflation which is against what bitcoin is about. I just find deflation inherently unfair to future generations.
Essentially yound adults will be fighting for a small share of the pie against their parents' generations who would have acquired their share when the pie was larger.

Not me. I would also be dead. It would go to a pool to slowly be trickled back out to miners who are working to secure the network. 
We are talking about a scenario where you, your kids and your grandkids have had control of the coins for 40 years each and neither you, your kids or your grandkids bothered to refresh them for another 120 years with a single transaction. All we are trying to determine is are these coins lost forever and if so why don't we bring them back again? I would imagine with the small exception of the three very disorganized and forgetful generations who did not remember to refresh their coins nobody with a functioning brain would lose any coins because of this.

I am sorry but unless we change the protocol there will always be empty blocks. If a miner finds a block straight after a flush every once in a while do you want them to have to wait for transactions to come in or do you want them to fill up the blocks with fake transactions just so they can publish the block?
The best choice is to just publish an empty block. Empty blocks are not useless as they still act as confirmations and reduce the risk of chains being orphaned.

Bitfinex's BTC-u is not representative of what the BU price will be in day 1. You are not just betting on the chance of BTC-u being worth more than BTC-c.
If you buy BTC-u and BU is activated after the 31st of December 2017 you get 0 BTU coins.
If you buy BTC-u and BU is activated tomorrow and Bitcoin Core adopt BU all BTC-u owners in Bitfinex again get nothing but BTC-c owners get BTU.
If you buy BTC-u and BU is changed and released with another name or if another scaling solution comes around you get nothing.
The only way you can get anything from BTC-u is if it fits a very tight criteria so the price of BTC-u is far lower than what it would be if it activates. 
If it activates within the next 8 all of the above risks of losing all your money would not weigh down the price.
It's the same reason why you can buy a $2 dollar ticket and win a car but you wouldn't say the car is worth $2. The gamble you are taking could make you lose all your money but for that you get a discount on the price.

I would say when it's cheaper to pay via the current banking system the fee should be considered too high.
Currently it's cheaper to pay via conventional banking if the transaction are:
-International &amp; under £16
-National &amp; up to £50,000
Lightening network does not reduce the fees unless you plan on making 3 transactions with the same parties in a short term period as you have to pay for 2 on chain transactions to open and close the channel and there is negative interest based on how long you leave the channel open.
Edit: Obviously, this only affects Bitcoin's usability as a **currency**. It doesn't really effect its use as a store of value. Buying and selling other assets will incur far more fees than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-27 12:21:55
3% currency exchange fees apply when sending money from the UK hence the £16 limit for international transactions.

Correction* and a rather large bit more.
@_date: 2017-04-27 14:00:31
Would you use a decentralised currency? I think it would be ideal for all transactions to eventually be cryptographically signed. It will be a shame if the blockchain can't provide that.
A few months ago I heard it was theoretical possible to summarise the balance of all the bitcoin wallets into 1 file and then get rid of the blockchain transactions that happened before the summary.
If you wished you could download the whole blockchain and verify that these checkpoints contain true balances all the way back to the genesis block but within the checkpoint only actual wallet values would be included.
You could schedule the pruning to happen on a fixed interval like every 10000 blocks (10 weeks) and require each miner to check it against the last 5 snapshots(1 year-ish), meaning unless someone can produce a false 50,000 blocks faster than the network it couldn't be spoofed.
It's like two blockchain running along each other. 1 at 10 minutes per block and a summary block every 10 weeks.
Does anyone know if this a viable option?
@_date: 2017-04-11 11:08:12

It seems like a good strategy for him. He can't reach 75% of signaling for BTC so if a UASF happens the chain will split and he will have a lot more than 75% of the remaining power on the original BTC chain.
He wants to force LTC into a UASF in hope that it triggers Core to push for UASF on bitcoin too. In my opinion if anyone wants to push a change they need to cough of the $ and buy hashing power. 
Let's see how UASF goes though, it will definitely be more exciting.

We won't mine our last coin till around 2140 what does that have to do with anything?


So you want to scrap the fee system as well as the current state of PoW and make it so people have to solve hashes in order to get their transactions through? 
What if they want to send transactions from a device with very small memory/CPU/battery levels? Will each person have to run a full node on each bitcoin wallet? What you are describing is nothing like Bitcoin.


Wishful thinking. If there is money to be made economy of scales will force whatever system you set up to be best adopted by large organisations.
Unless it is not profitable in which case people won't want to PoW in the first place and the network will be able to be gamed by any organisation willing to waste a few million sabotaging the network.

You read my comment with the wrong mindset. Bitfinex has done a great job with BTC-c and BTC-u and I could not think of a single thing they could change to improve it.
What I was saying is you can't compare the BTC-c and BTC-u prices as the two vehicle hold very different levels of risks and thus do not reflect what the prices of BTC-c and BTC-u would be on the day of a split.
You also left out my point that if Core adopts BU, BTU activates but BTC-c owners get BTU and BTC-u owners get nothing.

You also have to account for the fact that banks don't charge fees for a lot of service because they operate a fractional reserve which I left out.
This means there are withdrawal limits and risk of complete loss of funds instead of higher fees.

Just get his friend from Zimbabwe to send him his bitcoin address in a secure way and confirm some digits from it over the phone to ensure his email wasn't compromised. 
Then have your friend buy BTC from localbitcoin and give the BTC seller the address of the guy in Zimbabwe. 
Saves you 1 transaction.
Edit: The cheapest way would be to give the BTC address of the BTC buyer in Zimbabwe (who will send money to your friend paypal) to the BTC seller in South Africa who you will send money to via your PayPal.

There are a lot of costs and risk with taking cash. You need time at the till to give change without errors, count it at the end of the day, take it to the bank , make sure an employee doesn't steal it, make sure you always have enough change. Keep a log of zlistings and reconcile them against your bank statement and revenue report. Also there is the risk of fake cash.
Sometimes all that is just not worth it.

The majority of mining hash power were blocking the progress for years. In my mind mining is the only way to vote. Looking at the economic majority poses the same risks at looking at the mining majority considering whales could shift the economic majority themselves.
@_date: 2017-09-30 08:00:13
Economic majority does not equal majority of users. Whales have a lot of bitcoins and just the whales could push economic majority into different directions. Similarly large miners can have a larger impact than smaller ones. This was never going to be a 1 human gets 1 vote scenario and all you are debating is whether PoS is better than PoW.

Honestly I don't think you understand how Bitcoin works. Bitcoin can only have 1mb blocks. SW transactions take slightly less space. The limit is still 1mb. It would never even reach the volume of a true 2mb block even if everyone switched to SW.

BIP39 is a string of english words that can be used to generate your private key. WIF is a short code that can be used to generate your private key. 
Your private key is the secret password only you know and that only you should be able to generate or ever see that allows you to do anything with your bitcoins. It proves to everyone that you are the owner and anything you sign can be matched to your public addresses without revealing your private key.

PS - I don't think the majority of shit flinging around here is cause by teenagers. Most people here are adults. Teens wouldn't have had $50 to put on Bitcoin in the last 4 years and hence wouldn't be holding as much as an adult that could have dumped $1k a year easily.

You forget that large transactions happen off exchanges. If a company wants to buy 10,000 bitcoins they will be giving out offers to whales.
If Satoshi ever decides to sell he will be looking to sell to governments who may plan to hold. Literally no one else would be able to buy those quantities.

@_date: 2017-09-10 09:25:11
The purpose is not centralisation the purpose is double the number of transactions we can make per second. The only miners who can't handle 2x are people who can't afford to use bitcoin anyway due to the current fees.
It was not done by some silly miners but by 95% of miners who all agreed to it. 
The problem is around 40% of those miners only wanted segwit and will probably change their votes before November. The other 55% agreed to Segwit only if 2x was to be activated later.
Now the miners that got what they wanted will probably break the agreement and ignore those that helped them get Segwit activated.
Prior to the segwit 2x agreement segwit could not even get to 50% support.

I can't believe one of the reasons people have no control of their own Bitcoins is because they want to avoid the 1 potential future transaction cost when they sell for USD.

You burn electricity with your GPU and get Bitcoin. Who the fuck cares what your GPU is calculating and who is paying you?

The simple solution is to let it fork and let the markets decide the price. Just like Ether did.

Well I was making 100% over my electricity costs GPU mining zcash and selling it for Bitcoin. I just did it for the fun of it but after the price doubled that would be closer to 300% over costs.

Not to mention that you would be paying nodes by the minute AND you would have to pay 2 on chain transactions every time you open and close the channel.
So let's say we have mass adoption and segwit and people make 3 payments a day. You will leave the channel open 24/7 and get charged by the minute or you will open and close the channel every few hours and be charged 2 transactions on top of the node fees.
Even if the congestion on the chain is only as bad as it is now you would be paying $3 a day for 2 on chain transactions and node fees on top.
If you think this model can compete with fractional reserve bank's free banking services I don't know what to tell you.
The other joke is that if miners are only receiving $1.50 per on chain transactions and they are capped at 3,750 transactions per block, each block would only be backed by a maximum of $5,600. Compare that to over $25,000 today.

If it worked and people could actually follow through with it it would be a bad sign for Bitcoin. It would mean there isn't that much real urgent demand for Bitcoin transaction and not as much adoption as we think there is.
I doubt people would be able to stop transacting even if they wanted to.

Funny that I still have all my ETC and ETH and they are both worth more than before the split. Just hodl both chains. Two chain can coexist just as bitcoin has coexisted along all other coins. The added benefit in a chain split is that there is no ICO and everyone gets free coins on the new chain.

ETH and ETC worked out well. All a hardfork is is a new updated chain where everyone that had coins in the old chain get free coins in the new chain. If there is economic incentive to drop one of the two chains after a hard fork everyone migrates. If they both offer things that users want both continue as normal.

Have you worked in an accounting department? It's normal for these things to occur after the month end unless there is a process there for them. Day to day processing is mostly automated and getting a $200,000 payment released can't be done by just anyone. 
It needs to be cast and cross casted, reconciled and scrutinised. They need to check their processes to see why it happened and make sure it doesn't happen again. By the time the customer service manager passes it onto accounts 1 month is very reasonable.

Which is why I am buying all I can before the 1st of August. If the chains split I will hodl both. Any value that is lost in 1 chain should be hedl in the other chain. The combined value of both chains should be the same as the original 1 chain. I don't see why there is a need to panic sell other then the belief that others will panic sell too and you can buy it back cheaper from them later.
