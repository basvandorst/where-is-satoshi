I have used them for about 2 years with some of my holdings, no problem at all. But yeah that's a fair point.
The mac app is really nice though.

I have used wirex for some time, no problems with the "product" and the card arrived fast.
The exchange between crypto -&gt; fiat isn't supercheap though....
The customer support isn't the quickest one either..
It's ok but in the future better cards might come..

Perhaps Bitstamp?

Ask a friend to buy and store them on a software wallet like Exodus.

Point taken, thank you.
Any suggestions for another wallet?

You never go all in then ��.
OnT - i think you get the point.

The sect members will say: Hell yeah.
The TA crew will say: wait for the pullback. 
The financial advisor would say: diversify. 
What i think, never ever go all in. Unless you are playing poker and get pocket aces...
Buy some and hodl if you want.
But buy some index funds and save in some bonds or something also...
Good luck and trust yourself most of all.

Thank you! Will definitely check that out. I actually have a ledger for my Hodl coins :-) but that one is in my bank vault (to make it a bit more difficult for me when the urge of selling becomes to tempting)
The software wallet is for me the middle way for if i want to do some hedging or some selling, but also so i dont have to keep them on the exchange...
I dont keep more then ~0.2 btc, 5 eth  and some ltc,xmr and eos.
Logical? i dont know but works for me :-)
Thanks again, both for the suggestion and pointing out my stupidity.

Lol. You doesn't have anyone in your surrounding that can help you with that? I mean why not ask a parent?

Cool wife! Happy birthday!

That sucks... I mean 50 usd isn't an gastronomic amount, i think they should let you try this out, if you really want to. But! don't buy, just to jump on the FOMO train. 
Crypto is still young. 
Good luck bro.
