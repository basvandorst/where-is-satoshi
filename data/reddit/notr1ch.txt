If they're targeting that precisely they can probably go with a much easier and less "noisy" method of compromise than a fake CA cert.
@_date: 2016-08-18 14:40:22
This is what STS and HPKP are for, the user is forced to connect over SSL and the browser ensures the site is using a previously known public key. While it doesn't help if the user has never visited the site before, it does provide strong defensive measures from the first visit onwards.

A MITM attack should be extremely difficult if they have a proper TLS setup with strict transport security and HTTP public key pins in place. If a nation state can crack a 2048 bit RSA key then the internet is fucked regardless. Otherwise they will have to have a trusted CA sign a fake certificate, which will go all over the news and get the CA blacklisted on all major browsers.
@_date: 2016-08-10 13:49:56
Certificate looks fine here. Are you sure your clock is set properly? Regardless, a self-signed or expired cert would have no correlation to the breach.

Any real world miner is going to be running in a datacenter with 1gbps+ uplinks, at which point it takes 160ms to push out a 20MB block. Orphan rates are a non-issue at those speeds, assuming miners are well-connected to each other (one would assume the big pools all have direct connections to each other).
@_date: 2015-06-19 10:52:23
If most of the hash power is inside China, then you only need to broadcast to your mining buddies in China to drastically reduce the chance orphans. National bandwidth is usually a lot faster and cheaper than international - the rest of the world doesn't need to see immediate block propagation.
@_date: 2015-06-10 21:28:47
This isn't really much more than a fancy way of saying "Take over their network and redirect them to your own pool". Hardly likely to work against any competent miner.
BGP hijacking would be much easier (and has already succeeded), using TLS negates the whole thing anyway.
@_date: 2014-09-18 22:29:54
Given how BGP routers have been compromised in bitcoin attacks in the past, I wouldn't put this out of the realm of possibility. On a dedicated host like Hetzner social engineering or someone on the same VLAN might be an attack vector too.
The server compromise is definitely the easiest way though.
@_date: 2014-01-05 23:09:48
The requirements for a node are getting too high for some people to sustain running them, especially on a desktop PC. There is the high bandwidth usage which immediately dissuades home users on slower residential connections, disk space requirements which are an issue for those wanting to run on a VPS or cloud / dedicated hosting, and finally I/O requirements - disk seeks are slow and sending random parts of the blockchain to clients will slow down any non-SSD drive quite significantly. The disk seeks alone make it unfeasible for me to run a node on my desktop. Even RAM use is slowly increasing - right now my dedicated server node is using 600MB.
I really wish running a full node was incentivized at the protocol level somehow. As the network size and TPS increase this will only become a bigger problem that inevitably leads to more centralization.

You should also host it on its own server or VPS with minimal other services running. Currently it shares a server with many other sites, if any one of those sites has a security hole your page could be surreptitiously hacked, and https wouldn't help you there.

@_date: 2014-12-07 22:42:59
If you use bitcoin you should never even think about installing an extension that requires "all data on all websites". This means it can steal all your username and passwords, cookies and other security credentials at any time.

Any Chrome extension that requires 'all your data on all sites' is not safe.

That only works if the user has opened up ports on their router and allows direct connections to teamviewer. Otherwise connections have to be mediated through the teamviewer servers.
Someone managed to find this guys teamviewer ID *and* password which sounds pretty suspicious. Password re-use, sure, but who would you give your teamviewer ID to? I wonder if teamviewer employees have the ability to connect to any active client... /tinfoil
@_date: 2014-04-11 17:04:11
I wish full nodes were rewarded in the protocol somehow. There needs to be something for all the disk space, I/O and network bandwidth used or the number of nodes will shrink as the requirements grow higher and higher.

Well if you grant root access to untrusted apps that modify your system store, they may as well replace the entire coinbase app at that point.

Doesn't that only apply for outgoing transactions? If I have 100 people sending to one address, there's still no more information about my private key than there was before, since I've never signed anything.

Google requires registration and payment to put up extensions. Surely there's some legal recourse if Google knows who the author is.
Also, never ever install extensions that require 'all data on all websites'. This should really be called 'full control of your online accounts'.

You're missing the point of this - it's not about enumerating given a list of valid emails. Showing a gravatar without asking the user if they want to show it is almost the same as exposing the user's email publicly, since  gravatar is simply a MD5 hash. This can be trivially broken on modern GPUs (assuming lower case, a-z,   etc).
No site which takes user privacy seriously should ever use gravatar.

The website is very vague - if you aren't already into bitcoin and following what Circle is, it's not at all obvious what circle is or what it does. It looks pretty though :).
Lack of a mobile app is also a big hole in wallet functionality, hopefully it comes sooner rather than later!

Why run a node if you don't have the bandwidth?
@_date: 2014-02-22 21:50:47
Thanks for the response. Do you have any concerns over the potential of 3rd party interception of traffic through cloudflare, either by their employees or a subpoena that you would never know about? Have you considered using an alternative DDOS mitigation that doesn't rely on MITM, eg providers that offer GRE tunnels?
There have been incidents in the past where bitcoin services had their servers physically compromised by data center technicians - it seems the same kind of thing would be possible by cloudflare's server admins intercepting plaintext sessions.
On a side note, I'm curious if cloudflare could provide their DDOS mitigation without actually decrypting the request - pass through the connection to the origin while blocking non-SSL traffic. While it wouldn't block a L7 attack, most DDOS attacks these days seem to be based on UDP reflection and this would provide a way to perform some DDOS mitigation without compromising SSL/TLS integrity.

I just hope they cancel the invoice and refund me, otherwise if they post the merchant callback I'm going to end up ordering twice (using a normal payment method if this isn't resolved in a few mins).

The only source of an email is the IP address. Everything else is up to the sender.

There isn't anything they can really do about it - if someone hosts a malicious binary file it's trivial to modify / encrypt / etc to avoid any virus detection. Short of disallowing binary downloads (and likely raising the barrier of entry to 'unusable' for 99% of people), how do you prevent this?
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:01:39
Android gives you a big exclamation point warning you if any 3rd party CAs are installed on your device. I don't think this is a likely attack scenario as it would require a default trusted CA to mis-issue a certificate.
@_date: 2014-03-16 17:47:36
I think bitpay is broken right now. Just tried to order food and it's not confirming my payment either, transaction is confirmed in the blockchain but the invoice is still ticking away.
@_date: 2014-09-18 22:06:21
Or you can take the easy route and attack any of the 3rd party PHP scripts they have running on the numerous other vhosts. Dokuwiki, phpBB, etc all running on the same server as a bitcoin site is asking for trouble.
Whoever bet that 1000 BTC did not do their research. Stay far away from this site, it's not a question of if but when it's hacked.

We've been accepting bitcoin (t-shirts and other apparel web store) for over 6 months, and other than a few sales right when we announced it, there's been pretty much no one buying with it. It's easy to see why - most people are treating bitcoin as a commodity, not a currency. Why spend when your coin will be more valuable if you hold onto it? The only people I see who can afford to spend bitcoin are the early adopters who are  likely already wealthy.
On the plus side, there were no issues at all among the bitcoin orders we did process, not having the risk of chargebacks is very nice for merchants.

It's the IP of the node that blockchain first saw the transaction arrive from. Unless your client happens to connect to blockchain directly, it won't be your IP. Also you can use TOR if you're really worried.

It took me like half a day to implement bitpay on our site. I found the experience quite simple, certainly easier than PayPal since you don't have to worry about payment holds, cancellations, reversals, etc.
Bitpay handle all the customer support related to payment issues (over / under paying) so the only customer service issues we have are for refunds, but those are pretty straightforward. It's no different than PayPal since most refund requests come after their 60 day refund window.

It would be nice if the individual node status page showed the formula with the values filled in too. My node is lower than I thought it would be and I'm curious to know what's penalizing it.

Unfortunately the channel owner gets hit with the fee for this.
"You can enable Xsolla payment methods through the subscriptions tab on your dashboard. Processing fees are traditionally much higher with alternative payment methods (read: not credit cards). Due to this, if you would like to enable Xsolla's alternative payment methods, you will need to accept that these fees be netted out of subscription revenue."
Twitch already takes 50% of the subscription revenue so this seems a bit unfair.

I ran a pretty big node (200+ connections with good bandwidth) so I guess it stood out as a bigger target. They called and socially engineered my ISP to enable SSH and change the root password to the server running the full node. They then went looking through the box for wallet.dat and other bitcoin related files, luckily I caught it pretty quick (why the fuck was my server being rebooted multiple times?) and locked it down before any further damage was done.

How is a commit in a public git repository a cover up?

Seconded. I've been using bitpay for over a year on our site. Volume is quite low, but I've experienced zero issues. I've not even had to make any code changes because the API is so stable. Fiat conversion is at a good market rate and everything usually gets deposited within 24 hours.
Unlike coinbase, bitpay are quite explicit about not being a wallet - if you choose to keep a portion in BTC they send it to an address of your choice.

Session cookies are generally just opaque blobs that the server maintains state for. If the session is expired on the server, having the cookie isn't going to bring it back.

You can't feasibly spoof a HTTP API request.
I guess this is a measure against CSRF POSTs to the API, but a single use token would be more elegant.

"Most people" seems a bit harsh. There are always the vocal critics, but we actually accept BTC on our store at teamliquid (Bitpay) and there's been a good number of orders so far.
I think esports is a nice market for bitcoin - lots of international players, there's always annoying issues when paying people (prize pool, salary, weekly cups, advertising, etc). We still have people who want to deal with wire transfers or checks for example, I really hope in the future we can use bitcoin and bypass the archaic international banking systems.

Well I didn't expect to see this here! I'm the main developer of TL - I've been following bitcoin for a while and wanted to have it as a payment option on TL for quite some time as I think it's a good fit with our demographic. The integration with bitpay was super easy and only took a couple of days.
I honestly didn't expect much as I still feel bitcoin is somewhat of a niche thing, but so far today we've had three orders paid for with bitcoin. This thread probably has something to do with it :).
