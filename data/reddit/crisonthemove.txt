Disagree,  this market is in its infancy.  Millions of new buyers are just getting started. Most people around me don't even know what Bitcoin is. And I live in Europe.

Actually,  I'm mostly invested in alts,  and waiting on a significant price drop to buy  btc and then hodl. So a really good sell off by weak hands is what I'm  hoping for. The sooner it ends the correction the faster it will shoot up,  imo.

In a few good years when this market is no longer in its infancy but a mature, regulated, market,  we will look back in disbelief at the wild wild west we're living right now and say "those were the days, man"..

Apparently there are a lot of whales with  buying orders in the order of 100s of millions at  price point $5000, that makes it harder to drop from there... But you never know

It is.  Pick up some German text and you will see various words capitalized mid sentence.
