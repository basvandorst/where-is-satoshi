I totally understand that. But if you're going to be upset when you lose them, should of played it a little smarter. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:36:50
Why would you keep almost 3 full coins on an exchange? Play dumb games, win dumb prizes. Sorry for your loss. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:45:58
Can you say it a little louder for the people in the back?! This is gospel. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:41:04
I couldn't believe Missouri was the first to get something lol. About damn time. 
@_date: 2019-07-13 03:53:45
But also solid OC.
@_date: 2019-07-17 16:49:08
Obviously anything could happen but I feel like I've seen alt pumps bleed into Bitcoin after they have a  run. But alts are also severely over sold ATM (my opinion)  so we could be about to watch them boom and ride it out in the back seat.
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:16:30
It makes me very irate that entities feel the need to say how people can and can't spend their money because they see it as "ill-suited". Go suck an egg and leave me alone.
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:29:47
I wonder if it's actually cocaine lol.
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:15:02
The FCA said it believes such financial products are “ill-suited” to retail investors “who cannot reliably assess the value and risks of derivatives or ETNs that reference certain cryptoassets.”
@_date: 2019-07-13 03:53:31
This is disturbing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:33:28
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:59:53
Oh is the Roger news 100% for sure? I had seen some speculation. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:50:57
Oh shit man I hope you mean what you already had! Hope you didn't get in at 8000.. if possible?
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:56:27
Just a holiday deal. Your card purchases will usually be instantly put into the coinbase account. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:32:39
I do beileve so.. when exactly was that?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:52:09
I was hoping I had some from the fork so I could sell it! Sadly though I had none lol
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:34:01
They are going to go through the ringer for this. Can't wait to see what comes from this.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:58:34
Yeah the waves of it coming in and out are so easy to see! Ready for that next jump for that good surge of serotonin lol!
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:26:57
Go away. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:27:25
Say it a little louder for the people in the back!
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:57:19
If it's true. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:35:16
Also thank you lol
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:28:08
Oh okay! Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:40:34
100% of this thread disagrees 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:55:06
Phew! That's what I was hoping you meant. Yeah that does suck though, GDAX kinda dropped the ball there, not really sure why they showed 600% higher than every other.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:33:03
Going to check the dates!
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:32:47
Thank you
@_date: 2018-09-19 20:27:16
You're probably right.. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:56:20
Ah! Well that is good, everyone who would of bought at that high would of lost their butts and then hated crypto, no need for that!
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:51:35
I'm not sure yet, does anyone know if purchasing was available? Just wondering
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:58:51
I can relate 
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:39:07
Although your argument works in some less developed places, anywhere developed uses electronic money everyday and typically stores it digitally. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 03:54:10
I'll look into this, thank you
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:32:16
Yes I did. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 14:47:48
Let'em bleed
@_date: 2018-08-13 20:15:22
@_date: 2018-05-17 02:14:30
This guy gets it
@_date: 2018-08-19 00:43:43
Oh it says traders.. nah hodl lol
@_date: 2018-05-05 18:04:38
Think of it more as being an early investor in something that will possibly be used widely later in the future. People hodl because we beileve it will be worth more one day. But you bet your damn ass when Bitcoin can be used everyday for everything I'll use it everyday of my life. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 00:43:17
I'll follow something this beautiful creation all the way to the bottom and never blink an eye. If you're supporting a cause you beileve in then fuck it. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 02:56:00
Know I know that they don't run 100% 24/7 and no I'm sorry I don't have a perfect knowledge about Bitcoin. It irritates me that I ask a question I'm unsure about and all you people do is roast the fuck out of me. You act like Bitcoin is a community but then turn on anyone who isn't as fucking brilliant as you are. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 02:53:09
I was just asking a question...
@_date: 2018-05-16 21:01:35
....uh no. Sorry but you realize all your describing is the US dollar? Bitcoins value is derived from being decentralized. If the government made a token it would essentially just be the USD lol
@_date: 2018-05-17 02:14:21
You are correct! But what you can't seem to grasp is they already do lol it's called. THE U.S. DOLLAR. If they made a CENTRALIZED Cryptocurrency you are essentially just saying they will say hey Sooo this is Google coin and it's going to work in the exact same way as USD but it's called Google coin. Its like the centralized version of Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin cash arguemnt. Lol the point of crypto is decentralization. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 18:54:18
Please realize that it won't always be this way. Bitcoin is very young and growing still. But one day that will stop and the price will level out. Literally be almost a flat line. Obviously the price can change but it's a deflationary system. Sooo the only reason it would be worth less is if we stopped spending it... 
@_date: 2018-05-18 02:54:23
But aren't we just asking for more pollution by demanding more power?
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:53:58
Hell yeah reppin the MO. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 02:31:08
Why not just high all the time
@_date: 2018-05-04 02:41:34
Honestly I beileve everything would just transition from USD to Bitcoin, including the government and their organizations. Why would they continue to try to use the dollar if it's worth nothing because it's citizen's no longer use it. Obviously budgets would change though lol.  
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:07:52
Yes!! I think people are incapable of seeing the bigger picture when it comes to something like this. 100 years ago this wasn't even a possibility. Technology is marvelous!
@_date: 2018-05-05 05:51:33
Wow party pooper much? I even said QUITE POSSIBLY because it's all an unknown. And yeah I see what you mean with gold buuut I don't really care. If you're going to micro analyze everything about my excited Reddit post, then I know you are the sad one.
@_date: 2018-05-18 03:36:04
Jesus I can read the news and the numbers say Bitcoin uses over two gigawatts of electricity already which is as much as Iceland. It may seem small now but so is bitcoins market cap and adoption percents. What happens one day when it is huge and mining companies continue to sink money into miners so they can out hash their competition? Just gonna stand by as we cause more damage to earth while trying to fix it?
@_date: 2018-05-16 21:04:22
We can call it Bitcoin Meme, but tell everyone it's the real Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 03:37:36
Okay but why is it so asinine? I don't see what's wrong with bringing down the hash rate not only will it use electricity it will also make the mining more decentralized. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:20:00
I did read somewhere that if quantum computing could be used to hack the blockchain a quantum blockchain might be the answer. Pretty wicked if you ask me. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 02:53:48
What? I didn't say there was waste but there has to be a lot of use. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:04:42
When the incintive of return goes away it would mean it is being used as a currency...so...yeah.... Mass adoption= price stability. I'm honestly tired of this  my words of wisdom for you is, DONT BUY IT THEN. But don't be a whiny little girl when you miss out on the biggest financial opportunity and possibly the third great awakening, WHILE YOU'RE ALIVE. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 02:13:18
Eh so so. If my entire nation list power my bank would be down and out and there is 0 chance I could move money
@_date: 2019-03-19 00:04:48
Wow I feel really stupid right now. In my mind I was thinking wow if my entire country lost power Bitcoin would stop working but I realize now the rest of the world can just continue to power the system. I fucking love Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-11-02 02:34:18
No, just no.
@_date: 2019-03-20 22:57:10
I see what you're saying. Thank you for the reply. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 23:39:31
Alright im open ears for any info
@_date: 2019-11-21 20:26:52
We are up 70% in the year right now, these "dip" posts are annoying af.
@_date: 2019-11-27 04:06:57
Dude come on, what were you thinking? You're practically just carrying $7000 cash on your person 24/7. Shit like this is what people read and get the idea that Bitcoin is "unsecure".
@_date: 2018-10-26 21:47:41
This is just a crock of shit. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 14:34:45
I don't understand how I never had heard of Bitcoin till last August
@_date: 2018-10-10 12:52:14
I mean it's up 4% this month. Kinda looks like a slow uptrend imo 
@_date: 2018-10-13 02:51:16
It's on Hulu. I honestly think it's the first commercial I've ever seen! 
@_date: 2018-10-27 00:35:37
I know what you mean, but our debt can only get us so far before it all comes crashing in on us. Thats public &amp; national debt.. both are going to become an issue in the very near future. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 14:50:01
Bitcoin is what it needs to be when it needs to be. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:24:52
Beer lol. But thanks,
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:05:32
But if "Satoshi" owns roughly the same amount that the government owns when it's comes to gold or whatever, couldn't thye essentially put themselves in the same wealth controlling situation while also making my generation beileve in a form of currency again?
@_date: 2018-06-14 11:18:10
If it weren't for my love of the idea of Bitcoin this community would of drove me away long ago. I would ask questions and just get slammed for it, making people feel stupid is just going to drive them away. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:17:38
Okay but my generation currently has little Interest in things like gold. I don't have a point here im just interested to see how other people feel about this topic and want to learn a little more about why it could or could not of been created by the government. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:07:41
I respect that idea. I just think the government pretty much controls or monitors every inch of our lives and they know that younger generations are losing faith in the USD and could see this as a way to stabilize faith. 
@_date: 2019-08-12 16:54:40
And the sheep says bah
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:11:51
So you dont find it the least bit suspicious that agencies like the FBI and CIA can't seem to locate "Satoshi"? I mean come on if anyone has the capability and power to find someone like that it's them. I realize that the government does nothing more than create debt, but with my generation losing faith in the USD wouldn't you be looking for a way out of what is a failing financial system? 
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:26:53
I just don't trust the government at all and at this point feel they hold enough power to control every aspect of our lives. I think it's crazy to think they would allow something like Bitcoin to go on this long and not just shut it down, because they could. 
@_date: 2019-10-29 22:39:10
If you memorize your keys they really can't, but that's not feasible for someone with 1000 wallets. Who is to say the actually seized it all? There could be thousands of coins in a wallet they have memorized.
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:15:03
And you say that they gave up the power but they regulate ever single aspect of money when it comes to an individual. Taxes, interest rates, &amp; income. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:30:50
I'll message you tomorrow would love some insight.  
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:55:33
Seems like a very strange time to short, we've had growth the past few months. trends seem to like to follow trends so I hear a liquidation in your future.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:09:50
I'm 20. I don't really get markets or stocks.could just use some advice or words of wisdom. 
@_date: 2019-08-12 16:54:10
So I was watching a documentary about how the internet came to life and what it took and when they began to talk about nodes it raised a question inside me. Could we build a people's  "internet" on top of the Bitcoin blockchain and validate with our own nodes?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:06:16
But why is it not a bubble?
I don't fully understand?
@_date: 2019-02-09 01:08:36
It's all I could think about after it happened, I was just sitting at work thinking fuck I hope we broke the line. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 01:06:36
This is exactly what I was looking for thank you
@_date: 2019-06-30 06:03:09
Satoshi my person. Dudes got billions of dollars worth in one of the first wallets.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:42:00
Thanks man! I guess I will see you in 20 years, maybe we can grab some coffee and talk about the day we reached the moon!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:32:02
Aka all American currency lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:24:43
Because of what is probably fake news ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:40:11
Hey thanks for the words of encouragement. I will wake up tomorrow a slightly hungover man in the hope that when I buy back here in a moment it pays off in the future!
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:20:26
See this is where I beileve Bitcoin is the holy currency. I mean come on, no government involvement? Talk about choice. But that is also where I loose faith... Sadly the gov. Seems to officially hold power over me and all of America so why wouldn't they stop Bitcoin in it's tracks in the near future?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:13:06
You are correct..
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:12:16
I'm from Missouri cab drivers are slim to none lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:48:08
Will do! Thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2019-12-29 23:13:05
Although I get what you mean, this is far superior to an actual paper wallet in pretty much every way
@_date: 2019-12-30 01:06:15
I think that is a great use for paper wallets buy I've been holding for two years now and it was time to move on to the next step.
@_date: 2019-12-30 17:27:15
Sorry I miss-read your comment, what do you mean by bit for?
@_date: 2019-12-30 01:19:26
I think your terminology is a wee off
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:11:44
My concern is that mass adoption won't happen. I think bitcoin could fix what is now a cutie
Corrupt government but the majority of people I speak to About it just kind of laugh. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:08:37
Damnit man I feel so unsure due to the fact that this is the first investment I've ever made. I'm only 20 and don't fully understand bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-30 00:34:29
You can also add a passphrase on top of your seed phrase
@_date: 2019-12-29 23:36:52
Ledger Nano X
@_date: 2019-12-30 05:48:35
Also you can store like 100+ different crypto.
@_date: 2019-12-30 17:27:35
...in what way exactly?
@_date: 2019-12-29 22:03:28
What do you think I'm using the old paper ones for?
@_date: 2019-12-30 17:25:48
Yeah sorry 100 applications, 20ish coins
@_date: 2019-12-30 19:11:33
... How so
@_date: 2019-04-16 03:37:47
Damn come on really? Tangible things? Suck an egg lol, people USE BITCOIN it's not everywhere but it's happening.
@_date: 2019-12-29 22:15:07
Special edition the currently have!
@_date: 2019-04-06 17:08:01
When are short term gains considered a long term upwards trend? I understand we are having a great couple weeks but when can we indicate that this movement may be more long term? 
@_date: 2019-12-30 05:46:27
You can send coins from it and it's more secure because it can re-generate a new wallet for security. Also the ledger live interface is great. You can check the worth of your coins and what not.
@_date: 2018-11-01 19:41:37
Fiiiiine you are right. But in the end it really all adds up to money is debt, and we have no control over the way it works and that is an issue. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 03:09:22
It's so nice to see other people who think I'm not crazy, this guy's is ruthless
@_date: 2018-11-30 04:41:06
Belief that this really is the brink of something large. It matches with my ideology and I just like it. It for sure isn't because it makes me popular because when I bring it up with my friends they tend to treat me like I'm an idiot 
@_date: 2018-11-08 23:16:48
What a terrible pyramid scheme. They haven't made money in months lolol
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:09:43
Hey I wrote a critique on that exact article lol!
@_date: 2018-11-01 18:59:06
If you are wanting an article I can't really do much there. It's just common practice no one is out writing stories about it because well, it's already known? I guess you can just look up the history of bank runs and that should sum it up 
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:14:38
Thank you
@_date: 2018-11-13 15:11:42
Ive been reading so much shit over at r/BTC my brain is fried. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 19:01:43
So a bank takes your 100k and makes it into 190k... That what you are saying. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 19:02:12
Or 180 if we want to subtract the 10 they actually keep
@_date: 2018-11-03 23:49:11
I don't really think that is nitpicking, and yes sadly I don't have millions of dollars at my fingertips or trust me I'd be using it to support BTC also. But at this point I'm doing more for BTC than Roger just by owning and buying BTC... 
@_date: 2018-11-14 14:16:06
Don't be so sure I think BTC could feel a shockwave from the shit going out in BCH
@_date: 2018-11-10 02:08:20
Yeah if he got EVERYTHING in when they said he did he's not to upset at the moment lol. can I just ask how you heard about Bitcoin back then? I come from a small town in Missouri so I didn't hear much about it till around the $4000 range. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 01:35:42
No, dude I saw the video of the RV guy and I'm glad he is happy in life but DAMN what a risk lol
@_date: 2018-11-13 15:11:00
That yes sorry
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:29:21
Would interest gains even work? What money would the have to give you? In order to take your money and loan it they would have to physically give away your money. Unless the bank only loans out the amount of coins they actually hold. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 05:35:16
Very jealous. But even if I had heard about it back then I would of never of though about it the way I do now
@_date: 2018-11-10 01:36:35
IM AFRAID IM CRAZY AND THEN PEOPLE COMMENT ON IT AND MY MIND IS LIKE AM I CRAZY BUT IM LIKE NO IM A NORMY THEY ARE THE CRAZIES RIGHT. RIGHT?! 
@_date: 2018-11-02 03:03:48
Guys I tried lol. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 18:45:29
This is fucking hilarious
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:41:37
Solid freaking post
@_date: 2018-11-01 18:54:01
Any bank you deposit money Into, let's say you put $100,00 in the bank. They are going to keep ten percent of that and loan out the remaining $90,000. You still have 100,000 in your account and someone also has $90,000 from a loan levied of your deposit. Your $100,000 deposit just turned into $190,000. It's the way Banks work and make money. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:58:02
Interest rates are a necessity with how our money currently works. We are always trying to play catch up, with Bitcoin it is no longer that way. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:23:47
And yet it's still up 500% in a year...so 
@_date: 2018-11-10 03:21:09
One of my friends (who was one of the first to show me Bitcoin) told me he cashed out and BCH "was the future" 
This all came from a kid who was offering an ICO to people he was very close to along with a "share" in his mining business he was starting that was attached to some company. Him and another kid managed to get some investors and shocker one was driving a brand new Benz and the whole thing "fell apart" LOL
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:12:15
How so? 
@_date: 2018-11-13 00:34:26
And maybe hold off till Thursday just FYI
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:44:20
Your meme killed Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-03 22:13:42
Like what? Forked a coin and increased the block size? My question is, IF larger blocks are the answer and that starts to be obvious, what would ever keep Bitcoin from just increasing the block size of the chain and make bch completely useless...? 
@_date: 2018-11-03 23:54:39
... I think my verbage was correct for the statement? 
@_date: 2018-03-21 11:00:25
I guess I don't fully understand your question. When I say it's controlled by the people I just mean that we are what would cause price fluctuations with Bitcoin. The price depends on us continuing to use it everyday (volume/scarcity) I'm sorry if I'm not making sense, I'm not the best explainer lol. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 00:21:05
What do you mean
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:50:40
But Bitcoin can be divided into tiny tiny portions, Allowing for expansion. 
@_date: 2018-11-03 22:34:05
... advertising BTC? Come on man.. he advertised Bch as Btc and confuses the general public, even going as far as try to call Bch Bitcoin.. that pretty crooked 
@_date: 2018-11-01 19:08:14
Okay but if you borrow 100 from me and have to pay me Everytime I need gas, and I need 15 dollars worth of gas. Where do you pay me from. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 05:54:37
It seems impossible to me that it's been in the media that long

From what I understand that's another issue. The 15th is another halving for BTC so I guess if they pull out hash power it will take weeks for the chain to adjust the difficulty, making fees possibly very high.

Gold is a physical object which means it has limitations. One of those being it's not practical to carry around and use everyday of your life. Bitcoin is a technology and has infinite possibilities of adapting.  I hate that Bitcoin is compared to gold, lame argument.

I guess the easier path to this is just going to were all the money originated. Whithin the first couple paragraphs it talks about how the money we have and how the fractional system causes a "money multiplier". Money that comes from nothing. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 01:47:42
Although I see how you would say it is going to be centralized, I feel like crypto banks actually are not a bad idea. They won't really have much control over the money but can keep it safe. My main concern is the inflation of our current dollar. I think a currency controlled by the people is still the better way to go. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 03:11:30
I mean you can say that but it's a public ledger so fraud is a little bit more complicated, you cant exactly hide coins and you can't fake coins

They do loan out more than they have though so yes they do loan money that doesn't exist.  That's what a run on a bank is. Also in an all bitcoin world you would not need interest. All it does is keep your money valued with inflation. No inflation, no interest needed.

It's not that people think we are suffering along and barely getting by, it's the fact that our form of money has some major flaws attached to it. Bitcoin well... Bitcoin has like 1 and it's scalability. To be honest though in 5 years I don't see this being an issue any more. At that point you have a highly divisible currency, no middle man, and no political ties. To be honest I don't give a damn if it benefits business, that's not what it's here for. It's here to benefit you and I.
@_date: 2018-07-10 18:44:55

Okay so what you're saying is I can't be informed by the forum that I follow and trust just because it's an alt coin? I don't own Bcash nor support it. But I want to know if this is true or not

Nothing puts a fire under people's belly's like having something taken away from them. Especially when it's something like a financial institution that holds YOUR money telling you what you can and can't buy.

@_date: 2019-05-11 05:34:31
It's not just going to keep going up and up right now. Previous times have shown us corrections will come, hell it will probably be the middle of the week. Is it for sure? No. But is it likely? Yes. Buy a little at a time and just know that even your small amount is more than probably most people that you know.

Alright now come on, you've seen it I've seen it everyone has seen it lol. Denying it makes me take you way less seriously. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 00:22:34
Its a problem here also, I had just went to see if it was on fire over there yet and it just brought me to my breaking point on it. I don't care what they do there but I see the way it makes me think about the people you like BCH and BTC doesn't need that stigma. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:30:49
It's not really coping, he just doesn't see it in terms of USD. He cares about the number of Bitcoin he has, because he knows what he has and believes in where it is going. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:36:44
I think we live on a way that is not sustainable anymore. I don't just mean the debt and the unlimited money system, im talking materials goods. New cars new appliances new new new new new. We make so much waste throwing out the old and at some point this won't be sustainable. But I think without the "new" drive that our money need to be finite and fiat would no longer work for that. I live in the US and the only thing that allows us to keep upping our national debt is our GDP continues to grow because of all that "new". Once that's gone what happens? Bitcoin is what happens (and a greener world)

That's different, you are comparing a stock to Bitcoin. Bitcoin investments are 100% speculation, not something you should drain your retirement into.

Imagine trying to use a college analogy to make yourself seem smarter than everyone you try to banter with but then realizing that makes 0 argumentative sense since you aren't actually educated in any way in blockchain and lightning besides what you have read yourself and even then you don't give any actual logistical arguments besides name calling. Bugs are real in coding, even in Bitcoin. They literally found one in the code not that long ago.

Here is the thing man, this situation would have been 100x different if you had already previous been invested. I could send you $42 bucks worth of Bitcoin right now lol. But you haven't yet so you had to sign up, imagine if you hadn't had the money and wanted to buy it with a credit card but had to sign up for one, you wouldn't even have it yet to make the purchase. Losing $7 bucks sucks I get it but how would you mood differ if it was $7 more? Don't be so critical of something so new and growing.
