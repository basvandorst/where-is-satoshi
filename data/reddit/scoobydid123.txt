We need fair and decentralised exchanges.

These exchanges are on to something. I just wonder how much money are they making from charging these crazy withdrawal fees. Wanna bet? I would say fortunes...

One way to avoid this fee is to convert btc to neo or iota for example and withdraw. You have to check, but I remember the fee was zero for these coins

As far as I know, nope.

They kind of got you there. But remember this and avoid them in the future. This is how you can play this.

I am not using them anymore. Switched to bitfinex. Not perfect but better

We might need more competition on exchanges. These guys charge too much because they can

btc sucks the life from all the coins. I see even Ripple crying a bit now.

to me it's still incredible how one exchange (Polo) can charge 0,001 BTC and another one - like Bittrex, can charge 10 times more. This is crazy.What would be the underlying reason for that? Is Bittrex fundamentally better than other exchanges? Do they have such great functionalities and diverse range of coins to justify the premium fee? I think they're just charging because they can. Because people continue to use their services anyway. Because there are still few exchanges. Because people do not react to this.

those wales eating up ETH... do they know something we don't? Can the ETH hard fork overtake the rush for Bitcoin Gold?

I wonder if you could get paid in bitcoin
