I have over 10 transactions that are sitting in limbo for 15 days in some cases in my Copay wallet. I am very upset about this because my balance keeps jumping .05 difference +/- also while the wallet is updating. I have had this issue before and it didn’t seem to work itself out but is soon as my wallet is fixed this time I will be jumping to a new wallet. Not to mention the fees right now are ridiculous and even set on a super economy fee it’s recommending I send $40 for $100 transaction..? It really makes it hard to use bitcoin when it’s doing this. As much as I want to blame bit pay or Copay I can tell you that the reason I switched to their wallet was because I had the same problem using my mycelium. It seems like once my wallet gets large with transactions I always seem to start having this issue. Maybe the key to using bitcoin is to only use your wallet for a few transactions and then make a new wallet I don’t know..?

Bitify.com is an eBay for btc. If you lost it they’ll buy it.

No some of my transactions are not hitting at all and my wallet is in disarray right now going back and forth from showing more and more transactions pending. I just want it to be fixed so I can get my coins out of Copay.

No ticket put in....I probably will now though. This is getting ridiculous:(

I’ve used several times even since before it was Bisq and was Bitsquare. I’ve also traded on LBC maybe 10 times of which three of those were fraudulent and cost me my bank account. With Bisq I’ve never had any issue and I don’t even require the IDs of the buyer holding their ID in a selfie like I do on local bitcoins. For that reason alone I am a big fan of the Bisq network. I’ve never had an issue and to be honest I haven’t heard of anybody that has had a fraud issue. I’m not saying they don’t exist and that they’re not going to get bigger and more prevalent with time as far as scams go. However I am saying that I can see a world where this network works very well.

No pictures of him yet? I mean doesn’t he have Facebook or IG?

Whatever. Scammers will be known as scammers. You obviously haven’t googled your own name. Freewallet is a scam. Period.

I am switching out of it and moving on.

So I’ve received a new contact from freewallet support and they are completely denying their wallet may be at fault and that I’ve made the mistake of sending the bch to a segwit btc address..? 
My response to the first contact: 
What are you talking about I did an exchange on your platform from bitcoin cash to bitcoin so I am very confused.? Could you please look at it again and tell me what the issue is because I did nothing more than exchanged bitcoin cash for bitcoin. 
Freewallet Support: 
You were going to exchange BCH to BTC via our system.
But you've made a mistake: you've sent BCH directly to Segwit BTC address.
The transaction won't be posted properly because BTC and BCH are 2 different coins. To top up your BTC wallet balance with other cryptos, you have to use smart transactions (exchange operation). 
Unfortunately, in your case, we can't initiate a refund because the BCH chain is structurally inconsistent with the Segwit BTC chain.

I am absolutely just astounded by what has happened here. If indeed what you are saying has any truth to it why would I send bitcoin cash from my wallet to the same wallet that has a Segwit address? I am not new to bitcoin and I know exactly how it works. I exchanged coins on a repeated transaction because the first one had failed and your wallet offers me a repeat button. If this is a bug in your software then I would understand. And if it is not then you guys are very good at what you do. Please look into it further as I can show you the first failed transactions in screenshots from the wallet. Here is the 1st attempt Request ID: 6fdc3c37-986a-6478-87a4-3c7972c9b5c5

You’re right I will be pulling all my coins today.

Thank you and I will be switching from that wall it immediately. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 01:53:57
I guess I am extremely confused as to why you would allow me to exchange bitcoin cash for bitcoin and send it to a segwit address?? I didn’t do a send transaction I did an exchange on your wallet. So can you explain that to me?

I’m pretty sure you don’t own your private key. If so, prove it. PM it to me. ;)
