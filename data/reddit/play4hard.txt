Wow it seems you still have done something :)

If the BitCoin Bank allows you to have multiple deposit addresses, then your total balance won't be publicly available. :)

What deadline of 30th it is?
@_date: 2015-06-28 15:36:33
Why only miners can vote, and normal users can't vote?
Is it fair enough?
@_date: 2015-06-11 06:06:28
I am now using BOTH solution  and solution 
@_date: 2015-06-05 09:25:22
Not just 'some" people.. I suppose 'many" people want cheaper coins. They won't succeed. :)
@_date: 2015-06-12 05:00:01
Too many perhaps... although you could be right. It just makes me a bit hard to complete reading your post. :)
@_date: 2015-06-17 16:40:59
As long as Bitcoin is also moving up, I think people don't mind LTC goes up too. So no one is losing money at least :)
@_date: 2015-06-24 14:15:08
Those very wealthy bitcoin holders just want to be even more wealthy :)
@_date: 2015-06-14 17:07:34
You have free electricity, but mining Bitcoin on laptop will be too much burden for your hardware. If you overdo, it is possible you may even burn the hardware. 
If it happens, it will cost you much more than the electricity you saved. :)
@_date: 2015-06-15 09:34:36
Thanks. It clarifies a lot where this trade volume comes from ;)
@_date: 2015-06-18 04:37:58
Thank you for posting it. I'm reading it now...
@_date: 2015-06-20 02:07:21
How to make sure only US citizens can vote?
@_date: 2015-06-27 05:16:13
2 years 10 fold rule?? Just never heard about it.
@_date: 2015-05-03 17:41:47
21m is the hard limit set by the code.
That means when it reaches 21m, people can still mine but block reward will be zero and they will only earn transaction fees.
@_date: 2015-05-15 06:58:55
No one will spend time to set up a website that will have zero trade volume, coz there will be only Bitcoin buyers but no sellers there. :)
@_date: 2015-05-08 10:56:20
Sure, you can reuse.
Just make a copy of the whole folder of Bitcoin where the blockchain is stored, and then you can perfectly reuse it with a new installation of the same version bitcoin-core software.
@_date: 2015-05-11 16:58:15
Honestly, price is unpredicable. I even don't know what would 1BTC be worth in the next 10 days :)
@_date: 2015-05-06 14:48:12
If you have moved all funds to Electrum and you have backup of your seed, it should be fine.
And you don't have to post an address here :)
@_date: 2015-05-16 01:36:04
I've found the same issue today, and then just upgraded it. The new version works fine for me. :)
@_date: 2015-05-18 04:59:18
Look interesting. I think even it can be used to run a node, it will just be a slow speed node.
@_date: 2015-05-13 07:59:28
It will be good enough if all new businesses start to accept bitcoin. Customer behavior will change afterwards. :)
@_date: 2015-05-24 14:59:09
Talking about Bitcoin in general, you just need to include information here: 
Hope this can help.
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:19:24
This is absolutely a nice idea for promoting crypto!
@_date: 2015-01-26 13:46:27
I hope and believe you'll get refund soon :)
@_date: 2015-01-29 18:07:37
"Bitcoin killing Apple Pay and Dollars" sounds more reasonable :)
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:17:50
Who is the 150000th officially?
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:24:57
Seriously, there is no node near my region. Having one node near yours is not too bad already. :)
@_date: 2015-05-05 10:04:53
There is no need to restrict the number of transactions in BTC network.
@_date: 2015-05-17 07:53:06
E-gold was centralized and so they failed easily. Bitcoin is decentralized in nature.
@_date: 2015-08-13 16:22:05
This is really a way to make good use of blockchain. :)
@_date: 2015-07-02 07:38:50


Bitcoin price is not stable, you are right, but you won't likely to lose ALL value.
If you vote No on Sunday, there will likely be hyper-inflation in your country. Then you may regret you didn't even put part of your money into Bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2015-07-01 10:57:00
People will learn after this crisis. :)
@_date: 2015-07-04 10:09:21
This is not an ideal situation and needs a real fix. People are greedy and won't stop trying easier ways to mine.
Is there any simple way to stop "SPV mining"?
@_date: 2015-07-05 16:03:37
I had this idea 10 years ago. Who stole my idea then?  :)
@_date: 2015-04-23 10:42:46
I lost some bitcoins on a scam exchange ShareXcoin last year... :(
I hope you guys can learn from me that you shouldn't keep coins you can't afford to lose on exchanges.
@_date: 2015-04-19 08:41:36
Make a website your own. Then provide some services you can do and accept Bitcoins as a preferred payment option.
Good luck! :)
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:05:13
You are one of the best bartenders I ever heard. :)
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:02:36
Welcome to join the club!
@_date: 2015-04-14 14:13:02
I say NO to Bitcoin at the beginning until someone rewards me 0.1BTC for posting something funny on a public forum. :)
@_date: 2015-04-28 11:52:15
Nice idea.
It will be perfect if the coder can enhance the randomness of the keys generated that way. I think it can be done.
@_date: 2015-04-16 09:06:00
Blockchain.info shows the balance of one address only.
And obviously you have more than one address with non-zero balance shown on Electrum.
@_date: 2015-04-08 17:06:05
No need to be afraid of the government so much.
If there are a lot of bitcoin supporters in your country, it is unlikely that your government will really ban bitcoin, as long as you can still vote to elect your government leader.
@_date: 2015-04-21 14:18:20
No surprise if they do.
Bitcoin transactions are openly accessible. Theoretically you can also monitor them.
@_date: 2015-04-17 15:48:29
Good. And I hope your gf also enjoyed the process. :)
@_date: 2015-04-04 10:22:52
Not fake coins but they have no value. 
They are just coins for testing purpose.
@_date: 2015-04-11 16:03:07


So everyone replies here is not average human lol. :)
@_date: 2015-04-17 16:01:49
Just interested to know how you can know so many things about user amazon4u.
Apart from this, thank for your warning.
@_date: 2015-04-06 15:55:18
It is not just about the block reward. The actual reward can increase as the Bitcoin price increases, even the block reward decreases over time.
@_date: 2015-04-12 10:08:35
Great suggestion. Expecting more musicians to understand and use Bitcoin soon. :)
@_date: 2015-04-13 15:56:46
Never thought about doing in this way. Thank you for sharing. :)
@_date: 2015-04-08 16:45:15
After reading the whole thread, I still don't know what's the operation "TIKI TAKA" is about. 
I just know that being a mod in this sub is not an easy job. :)
@_date: 2015-03-03 17:23:32
Bankers still confuse Bitcoiners lol :)
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:57:52
Great to see more and more developments on MultiBit. Good job!
@_date: 2015-02-24 17:05:17
I see..... please just send me all info you have and let me try. :)
@_date: 2015-02-04 09:06:40
Good news. I like it :)
@_date: 2015-02-12 12:40:48
Too many trolls... really enough to scare me away from it
@_date: 2015-02-06 11:06:38
They finally understand that central banks can print money but can't print Bitcoin or Gold.
@_date: 2015-02-14 17:55:02
Not even any CCTV to monitor the ATMs?
@_date: 2015-02-21 13:26:09
You will get the coins, coz your wallet.dat keeps all private keys of previously generated Bitcoin address as well as any new address.
Just make sure you always backup your wallet.dat and you will receive all coins sending to you.
