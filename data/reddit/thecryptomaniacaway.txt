Title is misleading.


This could mean he doesn't do anything related to crypto if it doesn't suit Facebook. Also, if you read the entire paragraph, his aim is to see what benefits decentralization could bring to Facebook services, which could just be encryption (e.g. end-to-end encryption) and not cryptocurrencies.

...but they don't call a former CEO, CEO.

Sure, I think we can all agree it has *some* value. Now, whether that means Bitcoin is really worth nearly half of Google's market cap is an open question.

Definitely follow this advice if you want to lose money fast!

....and he'll sell in order to lock in those gains.

No. Most people that got into crypto this year were just hoping to get rich quick. 10K or 15K for a coin doesn't seem so ridiculous when it's going up 20% a day. But, when it's dropping 20% a day, people come to their senses and GTFO. Greed is a helluva drug.

My thinking is that after CME futures didn't push BTC past 20k, everyone just lost enthusiasm and decided to lock in gains. 18k+ for a coin only seems not ridiculous when it's going up 20% a day.

Or it could be 8k tomorrow. Then 4k. Better to go 16k, 18k, buy, then it becomes 20k.

I hate all the “buy the dip” comments. Never try to catch a falling knife. You don’t know how low it will go. 
Buy when it starts swinging back up after a day or so. Get in when the momentum is positive. You won’t get the best deal, but at least you know it’s headed in the right direction.

Why does everyone insist on buying the dip when the momentum is obviously headed down? Just wait till the next day if/when it swings positive. At least you know then it's headed in the right direction

Never buy the dips. You don't want to be catching a falling knife. Buy on the upswing after a dip, maybe after a couple days after you can confirm the momentum is heading in the right direction. You won't be getting the lowest price, but at least it's profit.

Mostly likely $400 mil in Circle stock.
