Shame on everyone who panicked.
I was on a bus for 24 hours just now, sucks it went so low, but honestly, anyone who sold so weakly deserves it.

This is creative, but would be similar to sending someone to death in a gold mine. Not quite the same on a metaphorical level.

Was listening to the History on Fire podcast crossover episode with History of Westeros, they were discussing times this punishment has happened in real history. Got me wondering what the bitcoin equivalent could be...
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:03:26
Complete douche right here folks.
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:30:59
So what you’re saying is gold &gt; bitcoin for killing?
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:20:29
Exactly. How can this happen with bitcoin? It can’t. Unless we use the suggestion in the earliest comment and melt down a bunch of trezors. Just doesn’t have the same resonance.
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:42:28
Stopped reading when the article talked about mining and said “soon this will end, since only 21 million....” yeah, soon, in 2140.

Piggybacking on from the comment earlier about human psychology, it’s a weird thing. When the price is dropping, you wanna sell, even though it’s probably a bad idea. When the price is rising, you wanna buy, even though you should have bought when it was low yesterday. That’s what makes hodling an attractive proposition, just buy what you can afford then don’t look at the daily price fluctuations, just follow the long term trend. Sure you could try day trading, but you have to think logically and without emotion, which for the vast majority of people, myself included, is extremely difficult.

So you bought at an all time high, less than a month ago, and you’re already complaining about not turning profit? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:02:03
Should have waited a year and bought ten new best friends.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:26:58
Sitting on the price thread, chatting to yourself. SAD.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:09:21
Nice, which exchange do you use if you don’t mind me asking?
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:50:07
It’s gone up which means it’s gonna go down which means it’s gonna go up. That article doesn’t mean anything.

WTF is up with people freaking out over a 3% dip. We’re up so much for the week, month, year, zoom out, get off reddit, enjoy life, come back in a year and be very happy.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:05:42
+27,4% for the week
+97,2% for the month
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:14:25
I personally like buying high and selling low.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:32:04
To infinity
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:30:41
Excuse me while I return to the real world.

Yes I also wish it would magically be a $1B per coin 5 minutes from now. I need to buy my Moon Tesla’s already.

It’s a dutch guy. Google it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:28:53
This pretty much. It just feels like manipulation. It sucks seeing your levels drop but at the end of the day, if you don’t sell, you haven’t lost. The idea of crypto is to move away from fiat anyway, so looking at the fiat equivalent is kinda stupid.

I think the site was down, same thing was happening to me too but seems to be fine again now.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:47:58
Same exact thing happened to me. If you check the confirmation email when you made the order, it says
“Bank processing takes 2-3 business days. The exchange rate used to complete the order will be the one available at the moment of processing it, which could be different from the one you see now.”
It’s really annoying, probably the last time I use that site now.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:41:11
Chill friends. Go outside, read a book, check the charts in a year, all is good.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:29:59
This thread is toxic. Crazy how many trolls there are.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:27:27

Anyone panic selling now is a fool and will regret being played in a week’s time.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:40:13
This is boring, where’s my free money?
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:23:48
I have a bit of BCH sitting on my exchange which I couldn’t swap during the pump (thanks blockchain), but now it hardly seems worth it when BTC is at an ATH. The BCH value still seems inflated, so might just drop from here, but I guess I’m in no rush to swap it over. I feel like if I did it now I’d be “selling low/buying high”.
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:56:58
I still have some BCH from the fork. Wondering whether I should sell it or just hold it in case it ever pumps again...
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:40:44
Search your email for blockchain. They would have sent you your wallet ID when you signed up.
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:30:37
Nah the podcast just had their wallet address on their website as a donation option.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:47:37
Who is buying right now? For all these people selling, SOMEONE is buying. Who????
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:15:08
Trying not to panic sell. Barely in profit now. Kicking myself at the missed opportunities to sell high and rebuy back in at a lower price. Feel like hodling just for the masochism of it now.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:26:49
Thanks for the kind words. I also only invested what I can afford to lose, so even if it went to 0 I’m still not gonna be in a terrible place. Hindsight is 20/20!
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:17:18
Today is the day we rally or we die!!!!
THE PRICE WILL GO UP OR DOWN!
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:00:02
My analysis of the $1000 rise in the last 5 minutes suggests we’ll reach 20k in an hour.
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:06:52
Just donated to my favourite podcast using bitcoin. The transaction fee was €0,08. Good stuff.

Did he say BCash?
