Do you mean faster as in adoption, or as in the internet isn't all that great with 4.8k phone modem?

The problem in that case was not due to bad paper wallets. The victim had to go online to send his bitcoins from an online wallet. The OP should be very careful.

You could also bitcoin banks that print their own notes backed bitcoins as in the free banking era.

Read how the U.S. handled its massive debts from WWII and the huge Reagan-Bush deficits.  That is what the U.S. will do.

They will buy all the larger mining operations. Then they will make money by requiring high transaction fees.

If there was a confirmation page with the address being sent to, the OP would still have his bitcoins. If he could convince a court that this gross negligence rather that just negligence, Coinbase would be liable, regardless of the TOS says.

How can there be official depositories if Bitcoin is decentralized?

I think it would be a good idea to try lowering the block reward instead of increasing the difficulty. Why should miners be paid more than necessary to get them to do what they do?

I think it is a good strategy. Getting 100% of the block rewards with significantly less than 100% of the hash means a big increase in profits. There will be no point in mining for other pools, and they will go out of business. A monopoly on mining allows for the reduction of the portion of rewards paid to miners. Transaction few are small compared to the current block rewards now, but in the future monopoly status means they can be raised significantly.

I think it is fair to say that Coinbase did not have the "bank level security" they promise (see below) in this case. In principle, Coinbase acts as a bitcoin bank, and the victim was using its online banking site. If banks do not have this problem, there should have been something they could have done to prevent this.
From their website home page:
Bank Level Security.
We take careful measures to ensure our website and customer bitcoin are as secure as possible.

The chart they posted actually had gold (blue) doing better than Bitcoin (green).

This may be a case where people who do not use bitcoin are benefiting from it. Bitcoin is inspiring companies find ways to improve how payments are made.
