Agreed, but in this instance he would have still needed to access coin base to transfer the coins. So that solution wouldn't have fixed anything.
Disable extensions/go incognito when transferring coins to/from a web wallet.

Or, you know, just do it yourself.
It's [really fucking easy to do it](

You need to learn the difference between speculation and investing. Please go to and to learn the difference.
What it seems like you want, is to invest a few thousand (the cost of the bullion) and have it be worth a lot in 20 years.
Investing - If you invest wisely, it should earn about 7 or 8% a year. Minus inflation, that's closer to 3-5% a year.
Speculation - Expecting more than you'll make while investing.
Speculation is gambling. There's nothing wrong with gambling, as long as you are aware that you are engaging in it. You would be far safer to invest that bullion wisely in Vanguard funds, and give monthly contributions (just as you would save for your own retirement). 
You can keep it in gold, or bitcoin, or tulips or whatever if you'd like, but understand that doing so is tantamount to playing blackjack with the money (maybe with a bit better odds).
Personally, I'm bullish on cryptocurrency. I am in no way sure of bitcoin, that said I invest in bitcoin with the understanding that I am WILLING TO LOSE ALL OF IT. Not 50%, not 80%, but willing to lose it all. This is the only rational way to speculate. I only do this because I already have a healthy Roth IRA that should do me well in retirement.

Now you just sound ignorant.
These laws are in place to protect the average consumer.
It's obvious from this conversation that you have not done any substantial amount of research on investing.
Let me ask you, if you invested that 10K, and lost it tomorrow, would you be able to recover? Would you still have a healthy retirement account that can support you after you retire?
Do you even have a retirement plan?
Chances are no, you don't. Investing in bitcoin has slightly better odds of turning out well for you as does taking your money to the horse tracks.
There's nothing wrong with gambling away your earnings, AS LONG AS YOU CAN AFFORD TO DO IT. You obviously cannot.
If you want to learn about personal finance/investing, I suggest reading [The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing](
Start with that, and maybe, maybe you'll understand why investing in bitcoin with the only 10K you have to spare is a terrible idea.

I don't think you can make the claim that I don't know what my money is worth. I'm pretty sure I know exactly what my money is worth. I don't pretend to know what money is worth to you, because it's worth something different to every person on the planet.
You ever go to the movies? That's far more wasteful than kickstarter is. You ever go out to eat at a nice restaurant. Total waste. Not to you, perhaps, but to me. It's a value judgement, and it truly is relative. You every buy nice toilet paper. Waste! Buy cheaper 1-ply, it's a month's salary difference to someone in the world (hell, it's certainly the difference between life and death for someone).
See my point? It really is relative.
I for one am happy that there's another option for people who want funding for their projects.

Well, considering the fact that bitcoin's legality in the U.S. is far from set in stone (don't expect any bitcoin company to be listed on NASDAQ soon), at this point your best bet is to:
1. Invest in bitcoin
2. Fund a startup that's working on bitcoin
If you don't have a lot of money, 1 is really your only option.
Accepting money as an investment comes with ALL SORTS of legal issues. Look up the difference between mutual funds and hedge funds, and that's not even small dollar amounts.
It sounds like you want to invest 1-5K or maybe less. 
Not going to happen.
If you can invest more than 10K, you MAYBE MAYBE can find a startup that's willing to take it in exchange for a percent of ownership. However, you'll need lawyers for that and OOPS there goes most of your 10K in legal fees.

If you read what I wrote, you'd see I never assumed to know for certain what your circumstances are. Apparently, you have taken care of your retirement. Good job. 
To me, that would mean:
1. You've paid off all debt (car, mortgage, student loans)
2. You've calculated how much passive income you need per year to retire.
3. You've maxed out your Roth, 401k match.
4. You've opened up a traditional brokerage account and invested in relatively safe index funds, such as total stock market indexes from Vanguard or Fidelity.
If you've done those things and STILL have 10K left then congratulations, you're ahead of most of America.
I'd take that 10K, and invest it into your traditional brokerage and wait until you have at least 50-100K. Then maybe you can invest in a startup.
Even then, you need to understand that most VCs invest in tens of startups with the goal that one or two will succeed. The risk/reward is just not in your favor on this. By all means, do it if you want to, but I'd argue the risk is too great for you to take.
You'd be far better off attempting to start your own company on the side with those funds.

I don't think it's a scam at all. All of the Kickstarters I've participated in have been very enjoyable to partake in. I've gotten my money's worth.
I've also spent less than $100 in every instance. You'd have to be pretty insane to think you deserve a huge return for such a small investment.

The only inconvenience is depositing cash. My credit union pays me back ATM fees from ANYWHERE up to $20 a month.
Big banks can touch that. That means I can use anyone's ATM.
I love USAA and Navy Federal.

You sold because you invested more than you were comfortable losing. If you make a bet, and it goes wrong, you're supposed to ride it out. I suggest buying back in if it goes below $400, but only if you can afford to lose the money.

Listen, here's a few things to remember:
1) Take responsibility for your mistake. It happened, don't get mad. You are alive on planet earth and presently no one is trying to kill you (I presume). So life is good. You cannot control the past. Let it go and attempt to take advantage of the opportunities you do have.
2) Character is not measured by your ability to endure successes, but rather failures. Look at Lincoln's life. It was a series of massive failures before he became president. What made him successful was his ability to not let his failures deter him from trying to succeed.
3) Know thyself - as I said earlier, know your limits. You now know that you cannot handle the pressure of speculation. So STOP speculating. It's not worth your sanity. Read "I Will Teach You to be Rich", live frugally, and the wealth will come. if you must speculate, keep it to less than 5% of your portfolio. If you don't have a portfolio, DON'T SPECULATE.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:39:58
Sounds like you lack the discipline to be able to handle speculation. You need to research the difference between speculation and investing. Know yourself. If you can't handle the pressure, then don't speculate. You're only going to end up hurting yourself.
