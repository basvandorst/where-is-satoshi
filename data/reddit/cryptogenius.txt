Yes, that is what money does...
The only entities that are "creating" wealth as you define it are sovereigns, and if you think that wealth comes out of nowhere then you had better think again.

I had not heard of Shared Coin prior to your mentioning it; it looks interesting. I only looked into it for about five minutes, but it seems that it increases the number of transactions due to its built-in mixing scheme.
Under such a scheme, the best design could possibly come close to doing nothing to the number of transactions, but it definitely would not be possible to reduce transaction quantity by just adding a mixing layer in.

I agree with you, right now there are use cases where off chain transactions are acceptable. However, I do not think it is a good way to approach transaction scalability and I think on blockchain methods, where they can be applied successfully, are inherently stronger than off blockchain methods.
An important thing to keep in mind is that the limitations of applying on blockchain transactions are being reduced through better software and more powerful hardware. A use case where on blockchain transactions does not work well today might see them working well tomorrow.

Off blockchain transactions are not a solution and are not needed to solve the "problem" of transaction scalability. Taking transactions off blockchain has few true benefits but opens up several drawbacks, the least of which is increased counterparty risk.
You will see more and more entities like Coinbase offering services that are entirely on blockchain over time.

The current limit of ~7 transactions per second is artificial. Bitcoin can and will scale to handle a very high number of transactions. The network typically sees less than one transaction per second currently, on average.

The level of bandwidth required to run a full Bitcoin node, with the network processing thousands of transactions per second, is already common place for residential service in many countries. Bandwidth would not be a huge issue even at current speeds, much less so at faster speeds that future services will provide.
I agree with you that bandwidth is a consideration, but it is not a large obstacle to transaction scaling. Also, there are possible software optimizations that can be implemented for Bitcoin before transaction volume swells to unmanageable levels.

Maybe not, but right now there is no known hard limit that would prevent Bitcoin, or a similarly based technology, from handling several thousand transactions per second. At that level it would be comparable to VISA and MasterCard.
