Don’t save up. Just purchase what you can now. If you keep waiting until you have “enough” to spend, you’ll never have enough to spend.

Please consider donating to Liberty in North Korea.
They help North Koreans who want to escape. One Bitcoin could help rescue about 3 or 4 people at current price levels.
Most North Koreans want to relocate to South Korea, but the DMZ makes that nearly impossible (exception being that brave guy who managed to be the first to ever run across the border recently...and he got shot doing it).
In order to get to South Korea, the escapees have to travel through China, where, if caught, they’ll get sent back to North Korea, where they and their families end up in prison camps or killed.
Sometimes, women escapees are taken prisoner and forced into sex slavery in China instead of being sent back.
Liberty in North Korea helps escapees safely get to South Korea, where they can start a new life. They accept Bitcoin. It’s the last choice in the payment options dropdown menu.

I don't usually curse, but after all the fuss over a few people trying to take over the free-and-open Bitcoin with the recent forks and everything...
What the fuck is going on in this thread? It's full of the exact opposite of what I expected to see from you guys.
Internet is a utility. All websites and internet should be equal. I don't want some corporation telling me what I can do online, just like we all don't want a few miners telling us what to do with our Bitcoin.
The current Net Neutrality regulations keep everything an even playing field. The electric company doesn't tell me what appliances I can buy. My ISP shouldn't tell me what sites I can visit.
Imagine you've only got one ISP choice (a real issue in many places). Now imagine your bank automatically closes any account that has Bitcoin-related activity.
Now imagine your bank has partnered with your ISP to block your access to all other banks, so you can't make a new account at a more Bitcoin-friendly bank.
Or maybe this...Imagine your ISP partners with an online retailer that doesn't accept Bitcoin, and blocks your access to places that do accept it.
Net Neutrality is the difference between:
1.	the teacher giving everyone an equal share of the snack she brought for the class
2.	the teacher giving the snacks to the fat kid (who already got caught stealing his classmates food) and trusting him to share with everyone else after she leaves the room.

I admit I don’t understand crypto currencies as much as I’d like yet, but here’s the way I think this works.
Every time Bitcoin is bought, sold, mined, or used in any way, it gets recorded in the blockchain.
Imagine the blockchain is a cell. Whenever there is a fork in Bitcoin, this “cell” splits into two separate, identical cells, which then begin to grow independently, like twins.
If you have twins, there was only one conception, but you ended up with two kids. They may start out looking alike, but end up with vastly different personalities. Maybe one grows up and becomes a successful lawyer. Maybe the other one ends up in prison for murder. Whatever happens, they’re both your kids.
In cases like this recent fork, the original twin absorbed the other...so while there was a possibility you could end up with two kids, you’re only getting one now.
You’ll never get “free” coins from a fork. Whatever you end up with, you paid for already. Your purchase is just getting recorded in two places.
In this case, Coinbase is just locking the hospital delivery room until they can figure out if you’re birthing one kid or two.

If I have a painting for sale, and someone takes a photo of my painting so they can sell it, they can technically take the money they make from their photograph sales and use that money to purchase my painting.
....That comparison made more sense in my head, but maybe it still works.

Here’s the way I approach keeping Bitcoin on Coinbase vs a hardware wallet...
Would you rather keep your money in a safe in your neighbors house or your own? Keep in mind that keeping it in your neighbors house means they also know your combination, you can’t access the safe unless they’re home, you have to share the safe with a bunch of strangers, and they could possibly move away in the middle of the night with no forwarding address.
As for the “now I have two coins” thing, it’s more like putting a dollar bill in a Xerox machine. You’ll technically have two dollars, but only one will be worth anything.
