How would they prove that the coins were theirs?

What's the point of re-rolling? Lower transaction fees on future transactions?

I asked Priceline in early April and got this canned response:


our system now allows customers to purchase a Hotel reservation using
their PayPal account for pre-paid rates. Once you choose PayPal as your
payment method, you will be prompted to log into your PayPal account to
confirm this is your transaction.


orders as forms of payment. In addition, please note that splitting
payments between multiple cards or changing credit/debit card
information is not an option before or after submitting a request. All
reservations made through our website will be charged to one
credit/debit card.


Development team so they can make future improvements to our service.




I sent them a link to the Expedia news and told them to step it up.

Cops are too busy beating people to have time for learning about things on the internet. Though maybe they go online while sitting in speed traps.

The value of investments with no inflation beats the value of investments with inflation. So it would be nice if we could get rid of the inflation. It's just a stealth tax.

Well, bitcoin could help them cut some significant costs or bring in new revenue streams, so why not?

But you build trust by establishing a reputation. With bitcoin, buyers need a good reputation too.

Don't forget about the sellers in today's inflationary economy. Why would you *sell* something if you can sell it for more tomorrow?
Also, in a deflationary economy, there would be more incentive to produce durable goods, and more incentive to save. I'd say that's better than our high use of disposable and near-disposable products and low rate of saving.

The government is *causing* the inflation by printing more money that they get to use first. They aren't harmed by it at all.

That was my point. If a deflationary economy is bad because buyers will hoard their money, then an inflationary economy should be bad because sellers won't sell their products.

Not completely anonymous. You can move bitcoin around all you want, but once you create a real-world transaction, you can be linked to the bitcoins.

People's livelihoods used to depend on making wagons with wooden wheels designed to be pulled by horses. They have (almost) all lost their jobs, but we've all gotten a higher standard of living as a result.

Can confirm, am Satoshi.
