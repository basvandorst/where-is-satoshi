Yup: using the simple directory.io design scheme. (I'm a programmer. Not a graphic designer). 
Nope: fully implemented on the back end. Let me know how I might prove it to you, and I'm happy to do so.

To search via (any) WIF key... Allows you to see if it is valid, and the public keys (ie: addresses) associated with it. 
For example (all randomly generated WIF keys):

Come on: Do you know how many possible combinations of keys there are with only the first 5-6 characters of a private key? 71-72 digits worth... (ie: 2^256 is 77 digits).

Question: if it "isn't even hard to build this" why do you assume that I'm "scrapping another site"? 
@_date: 2016-11-12 02:45:55
Read the "about" section of directory.io. You can search for private keys there as well...

Happy to continue listing randomly-generated keys:
Try searching for any of them on the site. They'll all load...

Time: yes. 
Engineering: yes. (not just a curl request to directory.io)
Computing power: depends on how much of the 1-2^256 range gets calculated.

Interesting idea... (thanks for the suggestion).
Just added a range slider.
However: the max value of 340282366920938463463374607431768211456 (2^128) isn't anywhere near the total number of pages... 
Thus the precision is dismal. 
Any further suggestions?
@_date: 2016-11-12 02:01:05
Yes. It does exist (hat tip). And I wanted to build my own! Fun challenge, interesting project, etc. etc. etc.
@_date: 2016-11-12 06:23:01
Delay removed...

Not trying to trick people at ALL. No malice intended.
This was intended purely as a fun / interesting project. Thus, I wanted to provide a way for people to remove an address (NOTE: without providing a key) if this site made them uncomfortable. 
Case in point: have deleted the "remove" pages / links. 
Furthermore: what's the difference between what I have built and [directory.io](

And more:

Thanks for your response. Any additional information / documentation you'd point me to about how bad signatures can break the whole wallet?
And: is this (ie: bad signatures) a hypothetical / future vulnerability or a historical attack vector?
@_date: 2016-11-12 01:19:58
YES: NEVER REVEAL PRIVATE KEYS (note the warning in the post above).
However, it is fascinating (IMO) to see the private keys listed in numerical order from 1-2^256. And, the ability to search via WIF for an (unfunded) address is an interesting thing to be able to do to see where various keys fall in the spectrum from 1 - 2^256.

Again, incredibly helpful. Thank you.

Thanks very much. This is very helpful. 
Let me ask two different (but related) questions: why would transactions sent to two DIFFERENT addresses have the same scriptPubKey listed in the transaction data? Could this be due to an old / improper implementation of an HD wallet structure? Given the key mappings you described, is it possible that two different addresses could receive transactions via identical scriptPubKeys (apologies if you answered this previously and I didn't understand).

So at like 3 bn checks / second, it would only take a few trillion years? Good. Just wanted to clear that up...
