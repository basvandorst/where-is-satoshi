What edits specifically did you make? Thanks :\)

Completely disagree with this assessment.


You're another person who wants Bitcoin to be everything all at once - faster, more secure, decentralized, private, let's just throw in deflationary and, hell, immutable while we're at it shall we? You don't understand Bitcoin's design - the network is *inherently less performant/less efficient* than centralized systems. Trying to compete with Visa is just insanity. Layer 2 solutions may be able to offer that, but the Bitcoin blockchain is not the right abstraction for that use case. 


Who says - you?

Where did you buy your crystal ball?!


Again with the crystal ball! Why don't you try some humility on for size, accepting that you cannot know the future and that Bitcoin's fate is not determined by your opinion that it should compete with PayPal and offer faster transaction processing than f*cking Visa (!).

I cannot wait until Ethereum starts to unravel. Any guesses as far as how long it will take, guys?

i love how i read a reddit response before checking who wrote it and think, "damn this guy gets it." 
look up and it's peter todd.

Could you elaborate on this a bit?

What is that mechanism? Not accepting double spends or something? Still not sure what the profit is...

Ha! ��

Do any wallet providers have an interface for this method/strategy that you know of? Sounds like a big improvement to non-multisig.

I thought ASICBoost went away post SW soft fork...?
Also, the block in question isn't empty... is the complaint that it isn't full enough?
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:03:34
Gotcha. So how does this tie back into BTC value? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:43:15
Is intrinsic value a real thing?
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:41:33
Agree 100%. How are there 0 other BTC brokerage businesses (like Coinbase.com retail style) competing with them? That is their main money-maker; GDAX *maybe* breaks even?

There's this thing called chargebacks. Made possible due to the reversability of bank to bank transfers.

Not selling i.e. hodling helps the price to not fall.

This is not true. What evidence do you have of this? The price is a function of supply (which is steadily but predictably inflating via mining &amp; block reward), and demand. Wanting to own bitcoins shouldn't be that greatly affected by rising transaction fees - heck, most of the big exchanges are still paying users' withdraw transaction fees! If you're a business, then you demand BTC to run your business and your demand for them is inelastic.
You are arguing that the transaction fee market should be highly correlated with the price of BTC. 


I completely disagree. From where I stand, Bitcoin is the only game in town when it comes to censorship resistant value transfer. &lt;eth-rant&gt; Sure, you could use ETH, but let's be honest - there's not really a compelling reason to use that over BTC if your goal is to transfer value. (ETH for value transfer is riskier - what if the chain forks again and your TX gets rolled back?) &lt;/eth-rant&gt; BTC users are not price sensitive when it comes to transaction fees they're required to pay. You're applying PayPal logic to Bitcoin - PayPal has to think about minimizing transaction fees, otherwise Square will come and eat their lunch (or one of the other host of centralized payment processors). 
I'm putting together a little chart to visualize how BTC price (in USD) has trended over time against BTC transaction fees. I don't expect them to be that highly correlated, but we shall see.

Pretty good explanation of where things stand now that BIP91 ( has been introduced.

The idea of having a central bank playing a role in setting interest rates is to try and achieve stable inflation expectations.
The economy is approaching a business cycle trough? Loosen money supply to try and mitigate the slowdown. The economy is approaching a business cycle peak? Tighten money supply to try and mitigate the bubble. 
In the Great Depression, interest rates climbed to a very high level while the dollar simultaneously was increasing in value (against gold which was the standard at the time, i.e. gold-backed dollars). Many economists make the argument that the Fed should have stepped in and lowered interest rates to prevent money velocity from continuing to fall (when the currency is deflating, which is what "rising in value against gold" meant at the time, people are less inclined to spend) since this reduces overall economic activity - the *last* thing you would want, arguably, when confronting an economic slowdown.
