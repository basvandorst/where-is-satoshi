What does that mean?
@_date: 2014-03-03 08:00:58
Sorry about that. So glad I had the service though, it's awesome to be immediately informed of the news.
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:17:41
Yeah, I was on when I got the text from Jerrytherobot informing me of the update so made a post about 5 seconds later.
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:11:05
I think that they mean they have that much in USD and BTC combined.
@_date: 2014-03-03 06:59:02
Maybe, but who is dumb enough to do business with them now?
@_date: 2013-11-17 12:48:35
Eh, I'm giving it as a gift to people who understand bitcoin, so they know what's going on. They'll like the paper wallet thing though.

You can most likely make etchant at home using chemicals attained from the hardware store. It involves pool cleaning acid (Muriatic Acid, better known as Hydrochloric Acid), Hydrogen Peroxide, and Water. You can find instructions pretty much anywhere, but [Instructables]( might be a good place to start. As for making the PCB design, you can make it as a photo and print it onto toner transfer paper or magazine paper and use an iron to transfer the toner. Again, there are instructions all over the internet, just thought I'd get you started. It's a fun process.

[Here]( is a digitized version of the QR code.

They're so cool to just have. They look and function so well, I love it.
@_date: 2013-11-17 05:25:27
Haha, yeah I'll be buying material goods too. These are just for close techy-friends.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:20:37
True, but if you're just using them once on a paper wallet, who cares?
@_date: 2013-11-17 07:14:33
You can follow instructions to print these out [here.](
You then send BTC to the address on the wallet.  When you open the flap on the wallet, you get a Private Key which you can use to redeem the BTC into your own digital wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-17 12:48:57
Heh, yeah, I guess.
@_date: 2013-11-17 13:40:55
Hahaha, maybe next year.
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:30:34
Haha, glad to hear someone else has been having issues. I just saw that it was the "biggest" exchange and stupidly thought, "it must be popular". Verification is the only way?
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:19:43
That's cool, didn't know about that company.

I'm just waiting for them to verify my bank account, seems like a much better option.
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:27:04
I'd love to, but MtGox won't release my 0.2 BTC without verification. Ugh.
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:53:00
Bit of an odd question, but it depends on how much is on one of them, and what the current exchange rate of BTC is.
EDIT: Just checked and $20 on the site uses the Coinbase exchange rate which is about 0.04 BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:09:39
Oh I see. Well hopefully my information helped. Thanks for your service!
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:39:45
That's a shame. I just want my 0.2 BTC!
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:34:58
Hehe, just trying to make it easier for people to donate to him if they want.
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:42:59
Be a little more civilized, I was simply trying to spark conversation to better my knowledge of the currency.
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:33:36
Yeah, don't think I'll be loading them up until near the end December.
@_date: 2013-11-17 13:40:31
Don't know why you're being downvoted, it's a good tip.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:55:31
[Here]( is the digitized QR if anyone wants to scan directly.
@_date: 2013-11-17 11:34:58
Thanks for the tip. Just noticed the proper way to do it on their site.
@_date: 2013-11-17 11:35:47
Price seems to be climbing steadily. Wouldn't want to load it with $20 if that will be worth $50 in a month.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:20:58
Maybe, it would probably be worth like, $5.
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:07:18
Aw shit, that's so cool.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:35:18
You can check the QR Code with Blockchain.info. It's the real one.
