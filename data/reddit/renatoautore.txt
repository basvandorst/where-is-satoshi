Great to know. I will write a new post leaving also my portfolio link 
@_date: 2015-12-16 11:38:43
ehhhm noooo, not really? With a good Social Media Marketing strategy you can increase likes, post engagement etc.
Did I mentioned 1000 likes overnight? Don't think so. Anyhow I didn't post for getting client, just tips on where to find people that prefer to pay in bitcoins
@_date: 2015-12-16 06:33:26
Yes, 
can you please email me at renatoc 
@_date: 2015-12-16 11:36:56
I can post portfolio, just don't wanna seem a scam, I don't wanna use this group for doing free advertisment that's it
@_date: 2014-11-17 09:32:58

Hope to have new customers that need a logo or a website and are happy to pay in Bitcoins :)

Hi utuxia, 
May I ask you why do you say that it is impossible?
Which difficulties have you found so far?
Kind Regards,
Renato C.
@_date: 2014-11-19 00:33:30
Yes, because it is cheaper to buy Bitcoins from an exchange.
@_date: 2014-11-17 09:30:34
With my business (  ) I have decided to accept  Bitcoin and I am really happy so far.
I accept Bitcoin for Logo Design but also for other Services like Webdesign and I think I did a great choice to accept bitcoins because is like I have open the doors to another niche of customers who support the digital currency.
Plus considered the low fee cost, I can even do a better price  :)
@_date: 2014-11-19 00:57:47
  without any doubt 
@_date: 2014-11-17 10:47:52
Don't give up utuxia.
I mean you can give your customers this OPTION, if they prefer they can still pay as normal, but as a modern business you should give this alternative as well.
I am sure that the more join Bitcoins the more it will be easy in the near by future to set up Bitcoin as method of Payment.
Maybe someone in this forum can help you with this problem?
@_date: 2014-12-10 13:01:39
Thank you so much! Please spread the word about us. I am sure there are plenty of people out there who needs caricatures designs, logo and website designs and are happy to pay in Bitcoins :)
