When I receive crypto to my wallet (im a business) then transfer this to kraken how would this look like in cointracking? 
For example, this scenario would look like: 
1) wallet deposit 
2) wallet withdraw 
3) kraken deposit 
4) kraken trade (XMR-&gt; USD) 
... my capital losses are wrong so somethings wrong. 
How does cointracking track the FMV of crypto I receive? For example, if I receive 1 XMR to my wallet on Jan 1st 2018, transfer it to kraken on May 1st 2018 then sell it on Nov 1st 2018, would cointracking use the FMV of the XMR I recieved on Jan 1st 2018 or the FMV on May 1st 2018?  (im using FIFO)

I hope I can treat it as a business loss instead of investment loss.
Normally its a capital loss in Canada like the US but after further research and CPA advice I can treat the crypto as business inventory with citation to "Adventure or Concern in the Nature of Trade" notabley lines 13-15 here: 
If I had to report it as a capital loss in Canada instead of inventory loss I would be paying $2000 in tax on $4000 of business income (even though I only actually received $1000 after selling all the crypto).
Im hoping I can get additional opinions from others before I decide what to do.
Treating it as an investment loss will make things much more complicated to say the least. US and CA also track stock values differently (FIFO/LIFO vs Canada's Adjusted Cost Basis "ACB").

IRS treatment of Cryptocurrency? Received $4000 FMV worth of crypto in Q1 2018 for goods and services I provided to a client. Traded the the crypto throughout the year as an attempt to make additional profit from speculation (~15 trades). Cashed out and sold the same crypto for $1000 FMV in Q4 2018. For Canadian tax purposes im treating the crypto I received as business income with the crypto itself as inventory (instead of capital) so the disposition would be a inventory loss instead of a capital loss. 
The above scenario would be: $5000 in sales ($4,000 for the work I did + $1,000 for the proceeds of selling the bitcoin), $4000 in purchases (the cost of the bitcoin received) and an ending inventory of $0
Can I do the same on my IRS taxes? I would include the proceeds of these trades on an additional Sched C.

Good analysis. 
A lot of confusion is also people using BTC for DM under the false notion that they believe their transactions are private. I believe a lot of DM's are honeypots or down the road will become one and many many many BTC users will be in trouble from LE

With a tumbler? Does Not work as its all still public ledger.
I can see cleaning it by converting BTC &gt; XMR &gt; BTC

2008 banking crisis happened because of government. If the government subsidized or would back/reimbursed my reckless gambling I too would gamble like a maniac. Its not the banks fault, its the governments fault.

Bitcoin is an open book so everyone and anyone can see how much you, what you spend it on, who you sent it to, criminals, organizations or governments can target you and follow all your transactions. BTC is not private and was never designed to be private and thats why I think its worthless.
is the only anonymous coin by default. You need an anonymous coin if you want a serious adoption by businesses and individuals. BTC is like a public bank statement where anyone can see all your history. Serious people and businesses dont want that.

Why are BTC users okay with all their records and transactions being openly visible to the public for anyone or organization to freely read and scrutinize? This is a serious question. Would you be comfortable with all your banking records being visible to the public? I fail to see how such a currency could ever be adopted at a large scale or people are willfully ignorant. Using a tumbler does not hide your transactions either.
Because of this I only use XMR as its the only private coin by default (basically cash) and is 100% fungible. 
I would like to hear others opinions on this matter.
