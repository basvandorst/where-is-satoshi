THIS.  Everything is a commodity.  
Currency is a subset of commodity - with certain attributes like ease of exchange, etc, etc.

I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that GHash didn't "attack" the bitcoin ecosystem (at least not by acquiring 51% of hashing power).  Bitcoin is built upon people working in their own self interest.  Trusting an entity not to achieve maximum hash percentage is not part of a decentralized ecosystem, just like trusting someone with 51% of the hash power to be benevolent is not part of a decentralized ecosystem.  
People don't buy bitcoin when you sell because they like you, miners don't mine for the benevolent protection of the network, and private actors will try to maximize profit (at least the ones with enough resources to approach 50% of the hashing power).  
Is one pool having 51% a bad thing?  Yes.  Is it GHash's fault for not preventing their own growth?  I'd argue not - if they can weather the bad PR - which will blow over, they'll make more money. 
Should there be disincentives in the bitcoin protocol to control more than 20% of the hash?  Absolutely.    Is that GHash's job?  Absolutely not.

The only value anything has is what someone else is willing to give you for it.  Most fiat is just numbers in a ledger at this point and are moved around using old, legacy technology.  (Not that shinier and newer is always better).
Fiat currency has worth because when a government says this is worth something, people believe them.
Bitcoin is worth something because people are willing to pay for it, as it is useful (take your pick - as a commodity, as a currency, as speculative investment, etc.)  
Diamonds are worth something too (because there is a monopoly inflating the price....), but you can't send them over the internet in 30 minutes.

I'm sick of hearing the line:  "Bitcoin is only worth what people are willing to pay (exchange) for it."  
Really?  That describes every currency since the dawn of time.  Also describes commodities, and every other part of our financial lives.  
Bitcoin is different, yes.  It isn't this completely alien thing either.

1.  The verification process is a result of your credit report, isn't it?  That is where the address comes from.... you may want to look into fixing that....
@_date: 2014-06-25 10:20:45
Congrats!  I'm headed towards one...just as long as that offline encrypted wallet doesn't go missing.... :P

....I just have a weekly buy on coinbase...but I'm boring...
@_date: 2014-06-28 02:21:36
This.   I'd heard about btc for a long time before I hit the obsession stage.  The blockchain......wow.

To be fair, there would have to be an incentive for the people running your Health Savings Plan to process your withdrawal faster.  You'd just be waiting 20 days for them send the BTC to your wallet. (Then the 3x10 minute confirms). 
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:13:42
Well - will the interest they are going to generate amount to more than building an efficient and useful system will cost?  
And I'm totally with you on the fuming, I just try to rationalize why some institutions are crazy.  (This helps me maintain my sanity in the medical profession...which is comprised of a large number of intelligent people responding to bizarre incentives, resulting in some truly obscene practices.)

Well, why only two?
Dogecoin was my gateway crypto.  It's fun, and everyone is very nice...which is good when you are trying to wrap your head around cryptocurrency.
Then there is BTC, which currently goes into my cold wallet - at least until I have enough to spend on a MAJOR purchase.
I've just started playing with LTC...I like the faster confirmation times.

Excellent!  Thanks! :)

I've had plenty of positive experiences with coinbase.  When you buy 0.25 btc at 147.83, you have bought it.  You just don't have access to it until the money from your bank account clears (unless you have a credit card set up on your account).  
@_date: 2014-06-27 19:27:14
That isn't any more complicated that building a website for fiat with a bank..... 
@_date: 2014-06-25 10:24:08
Shameless plug perhaps, but my cold storage wallet is a nice black card from you! :D

Speculators who think: " Will it recover after that? If it will, seems like a good time for me to invest..."
@_date: 2014-06-17 04:28:54
In cambridge?  Someone should definitely mention BTC to them, seeing as how they are right next to MIT, Harvard, etc.  They probably have more than a few customers that know what bitcoin is....
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:03:21
Oh no, they definitely want your money, and they will get it.  Why should your inconvenience matter to them?  You HAVE to pay your bills, or else your cell phone stops working, you get evicted/foreclosed, you don't have electricity, internet stops, etc, etc. 
If you don't pay for the tolls, you just get a pricey ticket...
Until you have an alternative for a specific company that does business differently, and enough people vote with their wallets..... enjoy the fucking forms and useless payment systems.
@_date: 2014-06-23 20:14:23
Thanks!  My first LTC tip! :D
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:00:06
Well...there isn't "credit" with bitcoin yet.  Wait for it, eventually you'll have btc credit cards/addresses.  
But I agree that people use the terms interchangeably, even though legally they are quite different in terms of consumer protections.
