I thanked the man for providing a service, problem? I don't think I said it was better, I said it's my personal favorite. Mainly because they trade in euros (I'm in the eurozone) and it's generally faster and cheaper than say MTGox.

I think this is the most level headed, well informed and above all rational opinion I've read all day, bravo.
I look forward to scooping up a bunch of coins when the market bottoms out!

No-one has any ideas then?

Any idea how i'd go about contacting him with the site down?

Thanks for this! bitcoin-central.net is my personal favorite.

I would, but the website seems to be down. Related somehow perhaps?
I definitely used my own wallet, i'm using the Bitcoin-QT client.

Hmmm, thanks for the advice. I will do. It seems odd that all of this happened right before the site went down though.

Well, I think it'll probably even out at 40 or 50, mostly thanks to silkroad. Whatever happens in the market, people are still going to want coins for that sole reason. Not to mention all of the other vendors popping up. Even if I scoop up a few and it falls 5 or 10 dollars in the short-term, i'm fairly confident we'll see some more growth long-term. Hopefully nothing as drastic as what we just witnessed though.

Nice one, though I think it might have just been a problem with the site (possibly DDOS) as i've just had a flood of payments into my wallet, lol. Thanks anyway. :)
