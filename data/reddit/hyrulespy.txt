Thanks for the advice thus far. Any advice for getting large amounts, what is classified as a "large amount" or Bitcoin? Is there any particular method to get 1 full Bitcion(faucets, ming, etc). Finally, if/when I get a full bitcoin, what's next?

thanks for the tip, would you recommend an online wallet, or offline wallet? How does the tipping system work?

Thanks for the advice everyone! I have another question that I want your full opinion on. What about other crypto-currencies, like Dogecoin or Litecoin? (Are they worth trying, what is the difference between other crypto-currencies and Bitcoin, etc). Also, I am not sure about mining(and I am a little worried that mining may give me viruses, or fry my computer). 
Do you think that my computer can handle mining?(I don't know much about the importance of specs, so I will list a few) 
Laptop Specs:
GPU:GeForce GT 740M
CPU:Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4700MQ CPU @ 2.40GHz

Thanks, I am a Canadian citizen, are there any Canadian-specific/Canadian currency oriented wallets that would be good?
