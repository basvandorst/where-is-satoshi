Every coin trades against btc or eth. That’s why the values are always highly correlated. Bots are a factor but not the sole one

Wow the neckbeard in here is strong.  This post has equal upvotes and downvotes because 50% of this subreddit is a bunch of weak-minded people who won't admit that what just happened with Gigahash HUGELY undermines Bitcoin and its infrastructure.  
If r/bitcoin saved the day, you have to ask yourself who is going to step in when the shit really hits the fan with someone who is actually trying to pull of a 51% attack?
The cognitive dissonance/forced positivity of this subreddit never ceases to disgust me, happy that you were able to see things for what they were.

I am not confusing this as I explicitly mention it. My point is this: there absolutely IS a transaction fee to get into Bitcoin and that is converting from USD to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 06:27:22
If btc gets big enough, the us government will shut it down. No bones about it.  I mean you don't seriously think the most powerful institution in the world is going to let some dinky currency controlled by a small company in Japan remove its single greatest source of power? 
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:59:29
I'm pretty sure Coinbase pockets that fee and doesn't pass it on to miners, but you could be right.  
I just don't see how we can go around proclaiming BTC has no transaction fees when clearly, you can't just magically have BTC. You have to buy some using a currency and there is therefore a transaction fee on the input.  While p2pBTC is free, this also true of USD through services like Venmo.

That would be amazing! Thanks for the offer. I hope people are doing this as it will rapidly increase btcs adoption rate. In NYC people sell them seemingly at 10-15% above coinbase.

I put this in because the dialogue was so blatantly truthful.

I hope you make a lot of money from btc, I will too :) it's not perfect, however 
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:29:30
on the plus side, the transaction was instant, but I'm not sure if this was only because I used the Coinbase iPhone app to send it. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:32:16
Thanks for the clear-headed response. If btc reaches a point of saturation, we can imagine a world where people exchange it and only it, but until then btc costs consumers money.

My fave quote so far is that Satoshi was a "world class programmer."  It's kind of sad and freeing at once to admit that I just have no idea what that really entails except that he did a bunch of cool shit in a computer. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:11:29
I'm waiting on my CB coins too! I just want to be absolutely certain I get them at the price I bought them at, as it has increased almost 25% since. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:41:29
Dude... that stings something awful.  On the plus side, that is some interesting currency.
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:33:36
Congrats! Yeah, I think I need better pictures.  It felt really good to spend finally, I love BTC, but feel super horrible that I never spend it cause, well you know. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:24:55
All those things are fees. Honestly I don't take anyone in this sub seriously because negativity is not tolerated by the neck beards.
Fee definition via Wikipedia:
A fee is the price one pays as remuneration for services. Fees usually allow for overhead, wages, costs, and markup.
@_date: 2013-06-05 14:59:57
Hardly the same thing? Mt.gox has total control over BTC.  80% of trade volume is effectively controlling the market, and if you control the market, you control the value-- at least in BTC's case.
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:30:49
P2pbtc is virtually zero, but fiat inputs have fees. Hence, no btc transaction is truly without a fee. If you use btc to buy a tv, you paid 1% to change usd to btc and that is only half the savings of a credit card. It's still a leg up, but this is a reality from the average bitcoin consumer side
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:12:17
Good nuanced point, but then the irony is that the one way to get BTC without a transaction/processing fee is the most expensive! That sucks. 
I just hope we can figure out a way to bring that 1% down. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 01:24:00
Such a simple insight, but extremely profound.  Thank you for your help.  
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:10:39
I am just making that point that from an outsider perspective, if I say "dude BTC can be exchanged for no transacation fees!" they will have to buy the BTC and pay a transaction fee of 1% to convert their USD to BTC.  To an outsider, this is a very real fee and it takes away 50% of the benefit of BTC has over a credit card, for instance.
How much is the network transaction fee and how does that work?
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:00:47
10% above coinbase, bitstamp.  There is a simple arbitrage to be done if you buy Coinbase BTC and sell in on localbitcoins.com.  People are paying for the anonymity, ostensibly, or they don't have bank accounts. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 08:08:34
This is actually some of the smartest stuff I have read because so many people are enamored with the concepts, they can't see to the average person, no one gives a shit. Kudos to you for having some honest insight.
It's like, I don't care about the CDN youtube is on, I don't care how Netflix gets its licensing, I care about watching my damn moving pictures.  When Bitcoin enables consumers to do things, that's when it will be worth real money, in the meantime, it's just a nerd toy backed by speculators. 
Still, one of the reasons I think it's such a good investment is because no one is really using it for anything.  Once people figure out how to translate into something my parents can understand and find relevant, Bitcoin's (or some crypto's) price will fly, and billionaires will be made. It's going to be awesome. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:06:54
I would suggest that neither of those exchanges is a terribly ideal market.  USD is horrifically illiquid out of MtGox and I haven't heard anything good about USD out of BTC-E.  
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but the ideal market is perfectly liquid and has no transaction fees at the inputs or outputs.

Yes, but I deserved it thanks.
No, you're right, but I just don't think the world is ready for BTC or the Nakamoto story yet.. give it a few years.  I have explained it to tech-literate people who are smarter than 95% of America and they're like wut.  It's just not digestible yet. It needs to be in a movie and some TV shows, and Miley Cyrus has to pull a Bitcoin (a physical one) from her panties or something before people care or get it.

Yeah something I force myself to think a lot is unrealized gains !=losses. I think one will go mad if they don't internalize that

This is the biggest Bitcoin news of the day by far and no one even knows it.  If this service is done well, Bitrated is a multi-billion dollar company and Bitcoin will replace Paypal faster than you can say "to the moon."
Huge.

Well now we're really getting into an implementation question. Technically, BTC worth $1200 on LocalBitcoins is worth $1200 if you were to resell it on LocalBitcoins, but if you tried to spend those bitcoins, they would only be worth $1100 USD anywhere else.

Yeah, that's all I was saying. Can I ask, have you cashed out to success on Coinbase? I haven't messed with it yet.
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:36:07
Yeah I think if we reach that point, you are absolutely right. I think probably if we do a btc will be worth tremendously more,
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:08:27
Call it what you want, but if you buy something and it is instantly worth less anywhere than what you paid for it, I think that is a fee.  
I didn't not realize you could post your own buy offer and get an amazing price. I already have btc, I am just posing this as a question. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:27:43
I think the only way you ever evade fees entirely is by accepting btc as a seller, but until it is all sold, there will always be fees at the fiat inputs. This is a downside and no one will admit it, but if you buy a tv with btc you didn't use magic Internet money with no fees, you paid a 1% fee at the input.
Thanks for the level-headed response
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:47:50
Yeah great point. If my friends tried to sell me on bitcoin and I knew nothing I would "ponzi scheme"their ears out. It's such a weird thing. 
Can't believe the prices today. I am stuck at the airport and it's my birthday, apparently ltc knows wtf.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:56:52
That is false. Bitcoins are sold on that website 10% above market rate as far as I can see.

Thanks for re-assuring me, man. I have been wigging out!  Happy BTCing
