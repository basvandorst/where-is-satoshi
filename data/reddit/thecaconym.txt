First of all, it's not "stealing"; it's copying data. The original holder of the data still has it and can still use it. Also, it's not even stealing what the downloader would've paid the content producer to access it; *unless* that downloader would've bought that content were it not available for free. Studies suggest that this is a minority of cases (IE, most illegaly downloaded content would not have been bought instead of downloaded if not available for download). Also, you may also be interested to know that illegal downloaders have been consistently found to be the ones that buy the most digital content.
You can find a lot of discussion about illegal downloading online basically everywhere (there was a recent discussion [on ycombinator]( about it for example); and you'll get some pro-downloading arguments everywhere as well. Often it boils down to "copyright/protecting the content producers' rights are less valuable to society and humanity in general than the possibility of providing all human data for free to all members of our species". And yes, it likely requires new incentives for content creators.
It's far from the only reason though. For example, I have still yet to find **any** legal service that offers the same quality as piracy does for movies and TV shows: no DRM, no bullshit streaming, but simply a file that you can download, *store* and backup, and play on all your devices and with the software you want. The only one that I know of is for games; it's called [GoG](
But even considering that, what if the person uploading his data to dotcom's bitcache is the content creator himself ? he gets paid for his content and no intermediaries are required. Said content could even be flagged as "official" in order to let the downloader choose specifically to download from the original creator instead of another one even if this other uploader is cheaper.

Exactly. The situation is also the result of post-scarcity in the digital space (we can copy data infinitely without loss at no cost) while the real world is still very much scarcity-based. As you said, we have a long way to go to find a proper way to support content creators.
But in my view, being a customer of the current distributors that are based on absurd concepts (IP/patents/copyright) does *not* help us get there; it just maintains the bullshit status quo; while pirating may help move us forward, if only by decreasing the revenue of actors based on those absurd concepts until they are forced to either find new models or disappear.

Or, you know, people that genuinely believe it's not wrong. See my comment in response to OP for example. Also, I know if I want to watch a movie or a TV show right now I have basically three choices:
* Buy it in on physical media; it'll take room, I won't be able to backup it or copy it, it may get eventually damaged, it'll be full of DRM, and I'll be forced to watch unskipable bullshit ads about piracy before I can watch it. No thanks.
* Rent it on a streaming service such as netflix. I won't be able to store it and backup it, I won't be able to play it on all of my devices, and I won't be able to choose which software I use to play it. Also, often I won't get either the subtitles I want or the audio I want. No thanks.
* Pirate it. It'll take a few minutes, I can backup and store it redundantly indefinitely, I'll be able to choose any community-produced subtitle I like (usually way better than official ones), I can re-encode it, and I can play it on all my devices as I wish. So yeah, I'll probably pirate it.
It's not just about it being free; the service offered by pirates is *far* better than the official one.

That's true; and it's still not stealing (unless, you know, you would've bought it if that was not possible).
You may even consider it a form of social protest against Copyright and its abuses. It's illegal, but it's *not* wrong. As I said, you can find a plethora of arguments (and counter arguments) to that effect online in a wide variety of discussions (I linked to one); and no, it's not - or not only - self justification for what **you** may deem "wrong behaviour" (or not, by the way).

I'm not very savvy on the speculation/making money side of cryptocurrencies (I'm mostly on the technical &amp; user side), but I would hazard a guess that it is precisely because ETC has *not* been forked and canceled.
I think the reasoning might be: if they forked following the so-called theft, what would they fork for ? a speculator losing a lot of money ? some investors twisting their arm ? I think one of the perceived advantages of cryptocurrencies is that all transaction are non-reversible; if you start forking when something bad happens, you're kind of missing the point and your credibility goes down the drain for a lot of users.
As I said, I'm no expert but I would hazard that's at least part of it. I may be totally wrong :-)

Yeah, a 72 million dollars heist performed at a desk in front of a screen :-/ Sounds like something out of a cyberpunk book.

ETC is Ethereum "Classic", the pre-fork one, where the "theft" has not been canceled. ETH is the other one.

Indeed. Not even considering the fact that there *are* countries, I believe, where ripping and backuping physical media you bought is by itself illegal - my country almost managed to pass a law to that effect.

Probably because Javascript is an atrocious choice for anything other than providing some animation and asynchronous loading on webpages.
