Yes but some of them used Android.

ADS are annoying. End off. I don't care if they are 2 pixels wide or only show up if I mouse over them. They will find a way to annoy me and do a good job at it. If you are relying on advertising for your content then you need to start rethinking your plan.
Plus, Do you really think people are going to click them? Seriously, Most of them refer you to some dodgy website.

Fair enough.
@_date: 2014-09-12 14:25:28
It wasn't directed to you. It was directed to the community as a whole. Sorry for not making that clear :(
@_date: 2014-09-12 10:39:19
Sorry I was under the impression that you were not talking about a dictionary attack.
@_date: 2014-09-12 10:06:45
You'd be surprised. People make this their job to get stuff like this to sell..... for bitcoin ;)

You seem to be seriously butt mad.
I suggest a chill pill.

What the fuck?
I have never heard of this before. These guys are actually just auctioning off money. Usually they burn it do they not? Or what ever.
Put it back into the system. Use it for scholarships or something. Do something good with it instead of pissing it away to the highest bidder.

There we go case closed. iCloud is safe. 4chan is pro hacker.

Wow guess someone got their coffee shat into this morning.

Not really an exploit though is it? I mean they could just set a delay on it. Would take longer but it would get around it. Then using a proxy list.
The login attempt really does nothing except annoy me when I need to figure out what password I have out of the fucking thousands I need to have because I need to use a ! or a @ or a capital or 5 numbers.
Bloody security.

Heh, I don't see bruteforcing as exploiting. Seems more like automated guessing to me.
@_date: 2014-09-12 10:21:44
Hmm yeah fair enough. But lets be honest here. Brute forcing takes along time to come up with anything that someone would most likely use. The fact that all of these celebs were hacked? though bruteforcing on iCloud? Seems unlikely
Plus, wasn't some of them on android?
@_date: 2014-09-12 19:44:16
You expect companies to not use passwords?
@_date: 2014-06-02 13:47:56
Yes I do. A large number of people on the internet are using adblocker. A large part of the internet also missclicks which then clicks on the ads.
And then theres the part which gets infected with viruses due to these "Hot Russian singles in your area!" I live in the UK, I have no Russian singles in my area.
If ads were more suited towards me and not just random crap then I would enjoy it more. Sponsoring people and websites is a great way to get your things out there. For example LinusTechTips has all sorts of amazing sponsors like Asus and other companies which provide actual things that interest me and other people. Heck I don't know if its just these people are the only ones sponsoring him but his content matches up with his sponsors which in turn is better for advertising.
You don't want to go onto a website which sells cookies and see a banner for shaving cream. No one is thinking of shaving when eating cookies. Unless you're into that.

Well. Don't buy their products then? Just because people buy the iphone doesn't mean their opinions on the phone are wrong. Compare the iPhone 4 to the iPhone 6 its a massive improvement.

You can pay with bitcoin. A couple of Colleges and uni's have started it.

Dr Nefario.
Isn't that the mad scientist out of despicable me?
@_date: 2014-09-12 13:42:22
I'm android.
Nice try though.
@_date: 2014-09-12 12:31:31
So it's a case of celebrities moaning about things that happen to every day people and it getting more attention because they are famous.
@_date: 2014-06-17 08:05:33
They made you an offer you can refuse.
@_date: 2014-09-12 09:50:49
Can we stop with this whole iCloud thing? I'm pretty sure someone just guessed the password. There was no exploit was there?
@_date: 2014-09-12 12:30:39
And yet I am being heavily downvoted by people blaming apple.
Heh.
