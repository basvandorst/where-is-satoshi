My goodness, I don't think any has mentioned yet that you should be using 2 factor authentication, make sure you don't enable your API key, and make sure the email that you linked to your address is protected (2 factor if possible, otherwise, strong password). There are some evil people out there that would love to steal from such a high value target.

You should be able to withdraw large sums of money as long as you pay taxes (Consult a tax attorney). What will happen is that a suspicious activity form will be filed against you and you will be looked into for possible money laundering activities, but assuming you're not a terrorist or a drug dealer, you should be fine.

Was your email and btce passwords the same? This seems targeted...do you know any shady people? Also, you should probably use 2FA for your mail also

The transactions aren't stored in the client, they are stored in the network. Lookup your addresses on  and find your coins.
