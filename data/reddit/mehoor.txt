How are the developers proposing to prune the Dogecoin blockchain?
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:11:50
The blockchain contains all of the transactions that have ever happened and in theory can't be tampered with or else all of the block hashes would be screwed up. Carrying around all of the transaction forever isn't desirable so some people have been thinking of ways to "prune" spent outputs from the blockchain. It's not an easy problem because as I said previously messing with the hash of a single block invalidates all of the blocks built on top of it. 
The reason I bring it into the Dogecoin conversation is because with 60 blocks per ~~minute~~ hour and a very liberal fee structure the Dogecoin blockchain is growing at a much faster rate than the even the Dogecoin subreddit.   
You can read a more technical explanation of pruning [here](

Well no, there's lots of alternatives that they could try. A simple one would be to stretch out the block time to two minutes. That would give them an extra year of high rewards and time for the price to appreciate enough so that 10,000 per block is a decent reward. I know that's can kicking but I think it's better than what's being proposed.

If you had asked here before signing up with MtGox you would have been told to avoid them. MtGox has been hated around here for well over a year. Coinbase, Bitstamp, Kraken, Localbitcoins are much better but you probably know that by now.
The fees issue is more tricky. If the fees really were zero or close to zero for all transactions the blockchain would at best become bloated  very quickly and at worst be swamped with denial of service attacks. The small fee is there to keep the spammers away and make sure that only economically viable transactions are included in the chain.
The liberal fees with Dogecoin might seem a great idea now but in another few months the blockchain will be even larger than the Bitcoin blockchain.

It's all down to the way the transaction information is packaged. It's possible to add little bits junk data without altering the information contained within the transaction (think of it like adding commas to the end of each address line on an envelope, you've added something extra without changing the address). When the transaction plus the additional pieces of data are hashed the result will be different from the original because the junk data changes the outcome.
There are workarounds being implemented as we speak. I think for the qt wallet it's as simple as not spending change outputs that have less than two confirmations and not showing the user the unconfirmed mutated transaction to avoid confusion.
The companies with custom wallets will be doing similar things. 
As for why mutable transaction can't be eradicated completely you need to look at how a computer packages transactions. Each computer system will encode transactions slightly differently so it would be very hard for the protocol to set down rules which every computer could follow. It's not impossible but it will take a long time to do properly and safely.

I've been pretty vocal about the insane housing policies introduced by the government I stupidly voted for. They've been pulling every trick in the book to keep prices high and supply low while propagating the mantra that high property prices are good for the economy. I always knew that it was mad but I never had the self belief to make my voice heard. Not any more. The flak I've taken from being a Bitcoin supporter gave me the confidence to say paying 20x times the average salary for an average house is crazy. I hand out flyers in my town centre explaining the maths behind mortgages and what an interest rate rise would do the repayments. I also show people historical house prices versus wages to show how out of balance prices have become. I've saved several 30 somethings from a lifetime of debt servitude. I'm on Twitter too demanding that politicians ease planning restrictions for house building.

Totally off topic but I wonder if you have any idea what percentage of Filipinos have bank accounts and also could you tell me the costs/time it takes to transfer money between banks in the Philippines?
One of my big ideas for Bitcoin is the spoke-hub model for sending international remittances. For example, in Europe send money to Bitstamp via SEPA for a very low fee (less than a euro), buy bitcoins and send them to a Filipino exchange to be sold, sell the coins and then transfer to a Filipino bank. The two Bitcoin exchanges act as hubs with the first and last transfers being the spokes. I know Filipino workers have little trouble opening bank accounts in Europe but yet I see my Filipino friends using Western Union to send money home. I wonder is that because bank accounts are difficult to open in the Philippines? Thanks.

When he says that nobody loses money to credit card fraud he kind of glosses over the fact that we all pay for it through higher fees and charges. When bitcoins are stolen the losses aren't socialized. Take your own pick which you prefer.

@_date: 2014-02-02 21:26:44

Unless the value of a dogecoin increases significantly Dogecoin transaction fees will need to increase to attract enough miners or the blockchain will be vulnerable to a 51% attack. Bitcoin won't have that problem because the decrease in mining rewards is far more gradual.

You as a customer have the right to stop using their service if you find them acting shady or if you continue to use them keep your account balance low to minimize the risk of losses.

Yeah, repeatedly saying how shit and mean Bitcoin is while Dogecoin is, "wow amaze love you all" must be getting a bit tedious on r/Dogecoin

And governments have the right to govern subject to their democratic mandates. A 20% withholding tax on incoming transfers wasn't part of any election manifesto so this move is at odds with their democratic mandate.

I don't think the malleable transaction characteristic will be fixed any time soon because it's such a difficult problem to solve. There's also an unwillingness to solve it because the devs feel that malleability doesn't contradict the consensus idea of Bitcoin. Instead of thinking in terms of transaction IDs think of them as what they really are - transaction hashes. Bitcoin works on consensus and before something is included in the blockchain there is no consensus on anything. Transaction hashes can change before they're included in the blockchain. This is a fact we're going to have to live with for a while

Much don't have a clue what you mean. Are you trying to say such donations only happened in Bitcoin world when Bitcoin price started to rocket. Wow little respect for history. In November 2010 when a bitcoin was much much less than a dollar the Bitcoin community funded Wikileaks after the Mastercard/Visa/Paypal embargo. Such amaze from the young Bitcoin community.

Do you have evidence that miners hoard coins?
@_date: 2014-01-20 22:50:59
In fairness you're not really repeating yourself, what you wrote has just properly explained what you were trying to say. 
It sounds like you think someone who donates Bitcoins now is less generous because they possibly bought/mined them ages ago for less money/difficulty. People can't help it if they value of something they hold increases. Do you think people should spend all their coins as soon as they receive them and not keep any for the future?
How to feel towards people who've made large gains from cryptocurrencies is something that Dogecoin should be thinking about now that its gone up 700% in the past week.

Why did the trustee need approval from a bankruptcy judge to repay the customers? Surely if it was all regulated the trustee could have repaid them without going to court. What if the judge had said "no"?

So Bitcoin is in a bubble but government debt which he thinks is wonderful isn't? What a joker. Government bonds have been in a huge bubble for the last 20 years. When they pop they'll take down entire economies.

The Bitcoin block reward won't drop below 1 bitcoin until 2032. By then either the Bitcoin network will be widely used and transactions fees will be enough to keep it going or Bitcoin will only exist as a chapter in economic text books.

Not going to happen in the way they hope it does. Offering tokens that be redeemed for dollars is heavily regulated. Because the tokens actually represent dollars all of the three letter agencies will claim full regulatory power over it and regulate it out of existence. If Brock doesn't heed to their wishes they'll just confiscate his reserve of dollars backing the currency.
Think Facebook credits, Egold, Liberty Reserve
It won't be anything like Bitcoin

Exactly. If people realised this then they wouldn't be so shocked the next time their bank messed them around. Once you deposit your cash it's the banks money and they can do whatever they want. You're only a little creditor they don't give a shit about.

He can't get his head around the idea that Bitcoin can function without there being any debt or liabilities involved. He doesn't understand how people can believe in Bitcoin as a payment system or money without there being an explicit guarantee from an issuer (i.e. the liability of the issuer). The more I read it the more I think he hasn't tried using Bitcoin.
*Richard Murphy says: May 3 2016 at 5:35 pm*  
*So you confirm the credit is not recorded*
*OK then – tell me who owns it in that case*
*Because I promise you it exists – and don’t give me the BS about mining – that’s an economic charade in my view. No one needs to ‘mine’ to make this system work: it’s just a silly game and not remotely related to any economic fundamental. Someone gains from this process outside the system denying the capital it needs to be sustainable – who is it?*
