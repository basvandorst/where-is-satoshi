The model predicts hyperbitcoinization. If this were the case, you would see significant inflation of fiat. Therefore, it would be a combination of increasing value of bitcoin and decreasing value of usd. Given all of the potential brakes on inflation, I think this scenario is possible but not likely.

Two questions:
1. Why is it urgent? (Don’t try to urgently time the market. If you think now is a new low or a new high, you are probably wrong.)
2. Why are there so many under 18 posts here? I understand that some people are in difficult situations and don’t have parents. For the rest of you, can’t you nicely explain and ask your parents to use your money to buy bitcoin and deposit it in a wallet?

I do have a dissenting opinion here. There are numerous threads everyday about individuals losing crypto on wrong addresses, lost wallets, lost passwords, etc. 
Losing crypto on an exchange can be devastating but is likely more rare than all of the potential human error of doing your own storage. 
For medium term positions, using an exchange with 2FA with an app seems pretty reasonable.

Yes. Mining sounds like an easy in. However there is speculation built right in. The miners are selling for inflated costs in the us. If you order from China, you end up waiting four months which results in significantly slower mining and unknown returns.

These tax issues will come up more and I believe the current tax community is somewhat ill prepared. Another strategy would be to document your ins and outs from your bank account and just report that. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:11:04
While it certainly depends on the reputation and integrity of the exchange, I think you have a point. Just look at all the posts with lost passwords, etc. In a way you are taking a bigger risk by storing info that can be lost, stolen, or destroyed.

Why not buy back 20k?That way you have your original investment back and can be a little less nervous about potential corrections. The only disadvantage of what you did is you now potentially owe tax on the profit you cashed out.

I’m no cpa, but I think that’s technically correct. I think if you sell a stock for cash on a stock exchange website it gets reported even though you immediately bought back in. 
The difference with a crypto exchange is the lack of reporting which may change in the future.

On the upside, the several hundred a month interest you are paying is nothing compared to tens of thousands you are up on buying the bitcoin in March.

I sold 10% near bottom. At that point I was still up 400%. I figured it was a small “hedge” against it declining further. I could afford to lose but preferred to lose less.

Just follow Wesley Snipes’ lead. He argued that he didn’t have to pay income tax at all. It worked out really well for him.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:53:30
Terrible idea. Sure that would have worked if you look back to this spring. It is still volatile. Next week, a correction back to $5000 would not be totally unrealistic. You would then be selling off coin to make payments on your loan. 
A better idea is to set aside a weekly amount you can afford to lose. If it does really skyrocket over time you are still getting in early.

I would stick with the bigger ones for the following reason:
You might guess wrong and buy at the top of the upcoming market. I think you have to be willing to hold in the longer term if you make a wrong move.

Even if all the remaining coins were instantly mined, it would be an increase of 33%. This would have an effect but would be self limited.

One issue that I have not considered is the possibility of a taxable event during your sale. If that is indeed taxable, you just got taxed at the short term gain rate. While that may not be critical, it’s important to do the math in your calculations. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:50:25
Again many disclaimers as I am unclear myself, but I believe the transaction just made you a profit in something with a defined dollar value and is a potential taxable event.

That video is hilarious. It idealized fraternal societies that covered healthcare for a fraction of a population. What an abject failure of a system! No wonder we gave government run healthcare for seniors. It is a vast improvement.

Your source is from a right wing think tank. Yes. Right wing thinkers don’t like to call their own country socialist. However, all of these countries have free higher education, universal healthcare, and higher taxes for the wealthy and corporations. Your last article references Bernie Sanders. It seems like he’s advocating for universal healthcare, better education funding, and higher taxes on the wealthy. That seems pretty similar. 
I would agree about the boom and bust statement. During a boom time, you should either pay off your debts or invest in the future. The US has managed to cut taxes and increase the debt and effectively do neither.
@_date: 2019-12-04 20:03:27
There’s not a lot of reputable for profit universities out there. While they are great according to our education secretary, they were essentially centers for fraud. Private universities are indeed more expensive but states have cut tax payer supported funding to public universities. 
We increased the deficit by cutting taxes primarily on the wealthy and corporations who in turn spent their money on stock buy backs. That’s not a great reason to go into kore debt IMO.

Would you rather that fire departments, roads, and military be all done by the free market and not by taxes?
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:58:01
All these systems were put in place because private systems failed. Where was all this private charity during the depression? Theft and embezzlement are rampant in private endeavors. Your premise that everything government run is inefficient and fraudulent is false. Look at Medicare. It seems to provide insurance with less overhead than private insurance. (And not for profit) 
In our current system which is privatized health care, if you can’t afford it, you go bankrupt and are more likely to die.
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:36:57
Ok, you don’t have to call it that but they do have funded higher education, universal healthcare, and democratic elections. When US politicians seek these goals, they are labeled socialists.
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:39:46
So who in these countries refute the socialist tag?
@_date: 2019-12-04 20:07:53
Private does not equal for-profit. 
Student loans are one part of the problem, but universities are expensive to maintain and quality professors are difficult to retain. They do require greater funding. You can’t just cut tuition in half and expect to find “pork” to counter it. This is actually what for-profit universities have tried and failed.
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:28:07
OK. So you are saying that school should be privatized too. Only those that can afford it should be allowed instruction. If you can't afford it, teach your kids at home?
Fire departments too? If you don't pay your subscription to the only fire department in town, they let your house burn down?
Healthcare too? Right now, states and the federal government subsidize a significant amount. If you can't afford the CPR, you don't get it?
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:23:45
Because there is no theft or profiteering in the free market?
@_date: 2019-12-04 22:12:40
Umm. Which elites does public school enrich?
@_date: 2019-12-04 22:46:44
You can look at the real world right now to get a sense of what is going on. There is certainly a spectrum of healthcare systems, but the US seems by far the most privatized. If doctors are unhappy working in the US system with the byzantine private insurance denial system, they certainly could accept cash only. 
Similarly, doctors could also accept cash only in a country with universal health care. If society did not have enough doctors, you could lower tuition for medical schools or increase salaries. This is the approach the military takes when it needs more doctors.
Nationalized healthcare does not necessarily mean less pay for doctors either. Canada's median salaries are very competitive.
Right now, with your 100 year old proposal, the government in fact does determine which therapies are reasonable through Medicare. For example, a heart transplant is not likely to be approved for a 100 year old patient by a variety of mechanisms. Private insurance also needs to approve therapies for younger patients. A doctor can't just order what he/she wants for a patient without private insurance approval. I just don't trust for-profit companies to make these decisions over non-profit governmental organizations. 
A vast majority of healthcare is delivered with basic checkups and medications. In my view, funding these would decrease the overall burden society and increase freedoms. Right now, the most common form of bankruptcy is medical expenses. This is the opposite of freedom from my perspective.

No I don’t. That’s why we have social security, public housing, and food stamps.
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:52:41
We actually don’t fund higher education well at the state level. Public university tuitions have increased dramatically. 
The US has actually increased its deficit to over a trillion dollars DURING a boom economy. This is spending money that we don’t have. Germany is paying down its debt with a surplus.

That is a pretty good summary. I do take exception with the "index of economic freedom" as it is from the Heritage foundation, a right wing think tank, that has manipulated opinions malignantly for decades. They actually predicted the collapse of all US healthcare secondary to the ACA.
The subtlety of our "capitalist" system is that there are incentives and benefits in place to benefit private industries that essentially become monopolies. Health care is a great example in our country. You really have limited choices when it comes to insurance and therefore hospital systems in most geographic areas in the USA. For-profit companies take advantage of this to maximize profit from the consumer. The wireless phone business is another example of this. There is a point where unregulated economies cause less economic freedom. This is not captured by that index. 
Socialist policies can actually increase economic freedom in real world terms. For example, if we didn't depend on our employers for health insurance, workers would be much more free to enterprise and start-up their own businesses. While at face value, paying more taxes for health insurance is "less economically free", in the real world it may not be the case.
