I don't understand your question.

Yes, definitely - I had no idea where the buyer was.

Yep! And no opportunity to get hacked by since I only use throwaway accounts.
EDIT: several people have lost BTC due to their activities on Reddit. The solution is to remain anonymous. I'm glad to promote great services that work well: I love Bitrefill, Coinbase, Trezor and now Brawker.

Well I buy BTC on exchange as well. The buyer gets a great deal if the price of BTC increases since the time you post the ad though - so in that case it is much cheaper to buy BTC on Brawker with a CC than it is to buy through a broker/exchange at spot.

I resisted for a long time as well. Lots of concerns, but finally took the leap with a fairly low value product (~$30).
All you do is paste the URL to the exact product you want, and then I entered the product name, style and quantity again in the separate field ("notes" or whatever) for good measure. 
You enter your shipping address (which you have to trust Brawker to keep private). 
Then you pick a password and confirm your email address. You also select a discount level, I left this at the default of 8%. 
I got several offers overnight, and then picked one at the discount level I wanted (8%) from somebody that had perfect feedback. Some people with a lot more reputation offered lower rates, so this required some thought. 
Then the person I picked bought the item I wanted within a few hours. To be fair, I haven't received the item yet, but when I do I'll just log back into Brawker and release the funds (they are held in escrow until I receive the item). If it all goes horribly wrong I'll get back on Reddit with a new throwaway and let everyone know what happened :)
