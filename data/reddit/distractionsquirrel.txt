she never believed me talking about it for years and always wanted me to find a job in my respectable field because all I did was staying at home watching some graphs go up and down after finishing university. I cashed out a huge chunk in November and all she and her family could talk about at Christmas was bitcoin

1600 - 3000 - 4600 - 6000 - 6900. bought 5x times at an absolute all time time high and sometimes I caught some nice dips on the way. . hell back then at the start even myself thought I was crazy.

I remember when I finally cracked the magical 1 btc mark. never looked back. wild ride and in for the long haul. all of us are still early adopter
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:48:51
yep, you missed it. time to sell all your coins.
i'm kidding of course - everyone here is still an early adopter - dont get greedy because you only have big gains in short time in sight. be in for the long game and you will be fine.
also that magic number of owning one whole bitcoin, I hear it every time I talk to family / friends. there are only 21 million bitcoins out there, so owning even a fraction of a bitcoin is probably more than all the people will have in the future.

it touched 19k right now. and it touches me where no one else is allowed to touch me. 25k for christmas seemed like a dream a week ago but well in reach for the next few days
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:44:48
for the last one and a half years I mostly gift bitcoin at birthdays. I remember when I first started my brother did not really know what to think about it but this Christmas every fuckin one on both sides of the family are excited. let's hope we reach 20k!

tried to be a day trader during the last  bcash pump and dump. lost about 15k - I learned my lesson. Hodl tight is always right.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:24:48
now. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:23:23
it's not. buy btc. tell your friends to buy btc. don't invest more than you are willing to loose. hodl.

that's not true. but with larger mainstream adaption people will realize how good the technology of some alt coins are already.
