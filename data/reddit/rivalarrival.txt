The vast majority of gold is resold in the exact same form in which it was purchased, not converted to a new product. This means that the value we place on gold isn't its intrinsic value as a commodity like wood, steel, oil, or pork bellies, but its value as a currency. As such, OP's definition fits all currencies, including gold. 
Which is why that definition should not be used.

True. However, a stack of $100 bills has intrinsic value as a paperweight, or as tinder for campfires.  But neither of these uses significantly drive the market for dollars. The industrial and cosmetic uses of gold represent a tiny fraction of its use. Like all money, it's value is overwhelmingly derived from its use as a currency, not a commodity.

This. A recent AMA with Tor developers indicated there were only ~3000 active relays at any time. A large-scale law enforcement organization (FBI, Interpol) or a conglomerate of smaller organizations could easily double or triple that number. What's more, the nature of the system pretty much means that they *don't* need a warrant to look at the traffic. You're voluntarily sending your traffic to these nodes. 
&lt;tinfoil hat&gt; This might be why we're seeing public interest in Tor. Law enforcement organizations could be trying to hide the fact that they are expanding the network so they can control a greater percentage of the nodes. If they switched on 3000 relay nodes or a few hundred exit nodes overnight, it would be pretty clear what's going on. If instead they give it to the media and expand Tor's popularity, they'll be able to add nodes and we'll just think that the network is improving. &lt;/tinfoil hat&gt;
