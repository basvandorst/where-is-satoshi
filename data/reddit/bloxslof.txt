What is the likelihood I will ever see my BTC back, after this event?
Mmm, let’s apply bayes rule:
- P(*bitcoin_never_back*), i.e. the prior likelihood I will not be able to retrieve these back, 
Let’s make a slightly optimistic estimation: say 0.45. 
Mt.Gox has had problems in the past, but somehow they always managed to fix this (as far as I know).
- P(*massive_selling|bitcoin_never_back*), i.e. how likely is it that massive selling of bitcoins occurred and GIVEN the fact that I won’t never see our bitcoins back?
Obviously, if someone would know that he will never see his bitcoins back, he would definitively sell them, soo let’s give this a 0.99 chance.’
On second thought, it is more subtle than that. The potential evidence (speculation) we’re facing here is far more complex : 
   - There is a massive selling AND someone had inside information before everyone else which state Mt.Gox is     going down with the owner going to the Bahama’s AND someone was stupid enough to sell his massive amount of bitcoins at once (considering he would lose much money by killing the market price)  AND all other kinds of panic stuff going on…
The longer I think about, the less likely I think the probability becomes. 
Other things are likely too. Think about it.
 e.g.  Mt.Gox could have been hacked, The FBI confiscating tremendous amount of money, where Mt.Gox goes bankrupt. The government's blocking Mt.Gox, Mt.Gox goes bankrupt. I mean, other things may precede the fact you won’t ever see your bitcoins back.
So, second re-estimation: 0.33. It is likely that such even occurs, but other events might have happened too, before Mt.Gox wouldn’t allow you withdraw your bitcoins for ever...
 
- P(*massive_selling*), i.e. the absolute likelihood that such an event occurs (i.e. inside information about Mt.Gox being broken AND massive selling AND…). 
Well, granted, it is quite improbable, but still more probable than all the previously described events  AND bitcoin_never_back..
So, let’s put a 0.3 on it..
So wrapping this all together, gives us
P(*bitcoin_never_back|massive_selling*)= (P(*massive_selling|bitcoin_never_back*)xP(*bitcoin_never_back*))/P(*massive_selling*)
0.49 = (0.33x0.45)/0.3
So this could be a borderline case, a bet, but that’s what bitcoins all about, isn’t it?

the max my wallet electrum allowed me to...
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:17:41
would it be a problem if I double spend, with higher transaction fee?
@_date: 2017-06-06 10:04:58
so now what, waiting, spending again? what is a good fee then?
@_date: 2017-06-06 10:11:22
ok thanks. I when will I know?
@_date: 2017-06-06 10:12:23
and is it an option to spend again with higher fee?
guess so
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:19:23
I used the latest version of electrum...
So who has tips on a good wallet, which requires only importing my private key?
And where can I monitor the average transaction fee? (or what would be a good fee now?)
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:32:28
Anyway, I increased the fee, to 8mbtc, it was processed immediately...
