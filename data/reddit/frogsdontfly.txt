Read a nice comment today from BakersDozen about this head shoulder nonsence:
*"...My astrologer agrees with you, but my tea leaf reader is hugely divergent and sees us hovering around 2800 for a while before testing 3k again. Then again my aura reader thinks it will hold current levels and that nice lady who reads my palm is convinced that Satan will take us all before the day is out. It's a tough call..."*
If reading charts of the past would help to predict the future all these stupid chartreaders would become billionaires pretty quickly.

worse, than be poor?
if it s true, what you tell, sell 90 % and stay with 10 % in coins.
Nobody knows, where the coin prices are going and if it continues to go up.
Could go down as well and than you are worse than poor.
If prices go up you can be happy to increase your 10 % and continue to get even more "money".
If prices go down you can be happy, that you saved your fortune.

Than Bitpanda must be much “cheaper” than Anycoindirect.
Anycoindirect has a spread of 12 - 15 % (buying and selling) price.
I bought BTC for Exodus wallet and thought, it was not to bad: just a bit more than 2 % purchase fee.
But when I saw the bitcoins in Exodus, their value was more than 13 % less.
No idea from where Anycoindirect takes his prices. 
To buy at Anycoindirect is comfortable but obviously the most expensive way to get coins.
