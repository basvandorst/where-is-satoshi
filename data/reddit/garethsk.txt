I got an email from Coinbase yesterday that said:
Good news. You can now buy and sell more bitcoin on Coinbase.
We've raised your limits to the following:
Buy Limit:   50.00 BTC per day 
Sell Limit:   50.00 BTC per day

If I asked my bank to send Coinbase money and in exchange store my purchased bitcoin, I could see an issue, but if I send money to Coinbase, the bank is just doing their job.

I could't find much in the way of btc merchants here in Knoxville. Was going to do my part and spend some coin. Nice to see we at least have this Alliance trying to improve that.
