you dont use bitcoin because of me?  god you must be a loser.  what do you believe in, the traditional and archaic banking system?  i'm actually a big believer in bitcoin and hearing that shopDoge doesnt accept apple products is pretty insignificant at this point.

Can you explain this a little more?
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:14:30
This is not confirming that Mt. Gox died at all.  They sound incompetent as shit, however they are working on it.  They assured you the coins were safe.  We have no idea what he told the early adopter, perhaps the adopter convinced them to shut down btc withdrawals and get everything squared away.  Why would you end such a good story with that you think you saw Mt. Gox die?  Mark cannot just pick up and leave or he will be in prison for a long time.  He made enough money that he can still pay us back OURS and shut down gox and be a free man.

What about one of these prominent bitcoin faces, a friend of Karpeles, like Roger Ver, or Erik V?  It could really magnify  their positive image and be profitable to them if they put up the upfront cash and take their share in revenue.  I'm sure there are plenty of bitcoin millionaires out there that could take this on if they wanted.

I had more on there than you Erik.  Is there even a glimmer of hope for us?  
You seem very confident it is gone for good as it very well may be.  Just hate going down without a fight.  Is it worth it?  Will 700k+ BTC in the hands of thieves really be ok for btc in the long haul?  I understand free markets, but this will be the toughest pill to date for the media to swallow.

@_date: 2014-02-28 04:13:04
Even as someone that admittedly lost a large sum with Gox I find this hysterical.  
My favorite 2 parts: 
1) when the protesters show up at Gox and Karpeles jumping down from above with a coin in his hand, and
2) in the beginning when the guy is punching the ATM and Karpeles is "zzzZZZzzzZZZ"  hahaha wtf

Correct me if I'm wrong, but based on my local gas station (in the picture I posted) you can see an instant 2% savings when using cash.  It will take more merchants to put the credit card fees on the consumer for the consumer to realize any benefit.  I know this has been mentioned before, but I think it is important and needs to be showcased once again.

paging ... I know you said these coins are most likely gone forever, but this could be quite a turnaround project
@_date: 2014-02-09 19:45:31
its been around for the longest of all exchanges.  they have so much money from the volume of trades and trading fees they've taken over the course of many years, it doesn't make sense that they would be insolvent. it doesn't make sense for them to take peoples' money in the exchanges and go to prison, rather than pay everyone what they own and still be rich and happy.  it doesn't make sense for them to take peoples' coins because the value of them will absolutely plummet as no one would trust btc, so they would probably actually be richer if they didn't steal anyone's coins (in case you are thinking greed is the motivating factor).  therefore, unlike you, it doesn't amaze me that people have confidence in Gox coming through.

Pretty sure Fiat restrictions have to do with their filing with JP that restricts wire withdrawals.  BTC withdrawal problems are being fixed.  They are no angels by any means, but I don't think they're broke.  Maybe I'm wrong.

@_date: 2014-02-28 04:50:14
The "lost" keys need a little bit of explaining, there's got to be a story/reason  behind them.  There may be a coverup, gov't seizure, time lock?  We need answers.  Considering the 500k coins lost, a lot of people, including myself, had a lot on Mt. Gox and seeing 250k potential payback coins just sitting there in Gox addresses and letting them get away with calling them "lost" or "temporarily unavailable" is unacceptable.

This community is one that always struck me as tight-knit and one you can depend on, since we always shared the same passion, which is Bitcoin.  As a semi-early adopter who has done much good for bitcoin and who believes in it significantly, promotes it, wants to build infrastructure, it pains me to have lost most of what I hold to Mt. Gox.  I'm not blaming anyone but myself, but the fact that when I come on here I have to hear troll breath and countless remarks about how stupid I am etc etc, makes me sick.   It's amazing how two-faced this community can be and how quickly they're willing to disown you.  Not cool.

Trading question:
if one person wanted to buy 1 BTC @ $500 USD on Gox and 1 person wanted to sell 1 BTC @ $500 USD on Gox, then what would dictate if the order was a buy or a sell order (i.e. whether it is red or green on bitcoinwisdom)?  
@_date: 2014-05-22 20:27:15
haha mine has been processing for about an hour
@_date: 2014-03-08 12:57:16
I am a once or twice a year trader.  Someone who goes into Fiat and scoops up more coins when the price drops.  I was a verified Gox customer.  Although they "buckled" in 2013, they had been fine after that.  The $100 price difference everybody attributed to lack of fiat withdrawals causing people to buy coins back driving the price up.  That was NOT an indication of a fractional reserve operation to most people, including myself.  I deposited my coins to Gox Jan 19 and my attempt to withdrawal my coins was Jan. 20, several days before the malleability issues were reported, but the coins were STUCK in broken Txns for 10 days.  There was no leaving Gox once coins went in there.  It was horrible timing.  I don't think I fit your criteria, but you can call me stupid.   Hindsight is 20-20.  Nonetheless, I am certain even with the limited info out there at the time, it isn't that unbelievable that people still used Gox.

I dislike Jim Cramer greatly.  I chose to sign up for his stock picks one day (way before I got into bitcoin) and I picked up all of his picks and lost a ton of money.  He has a bad track record, has been known to do insider tactics to pump and dump, and he mouths off like he knows everything.  He is the epitome of a scumbag wall st banker.  He is also on the record for wanting bitcoin to fail immensely, which is not a surprise to anyone.

It is a lot like how Paypal is a payment account structured separately, but connected to your bank account.  If you don't feel comfortable with that (although they are probably as trustworthy as Paypal or better) you could get verified with Bitstamp, which is probably the most trusted exchange today and then send a bank wire over and you could purchase bitcoins on the Bitstamp exchange once your funds reach there.  I would estimate a few days for verification and another 2 for the bank wire to show up.  That way you will have no connection to bank account, although they will have your identity on file per requirements for money laundering purposes.  But once you buy bitcoin, you can send them to your personal computer and not leave them in the hands of an exchange.  You can finally be your own bank.

There is no sufficient evidence proving such.  It's all FUD spread by Gox haters, which is mainly due to Gox's ineptitude regarding running a well-oiled machine of an exchange.  Poor PR, poor customer service, etc.  They have been around since the beginning and although people may lose faith, I would bet they are far from broke.

Agree, they've been doing it in the markets for years to overcome psychological barriers.  It's called a stock split.  See investopedia reasoning behind it:
"While a split in theory should have no effect on a stock's price, it often results in renewed investor interest, which can have a positive impact on the stock price. While this effect can be temporary, the fact remains that stock splits by blue chip companies are a great way for the average investor to accumulate an increasing number of shares in these companies. Many of the best companies routinely exceed the price level at which they had previously split their stock, causing them to undergo a stock split yet again. Wal-Mart, for instance, has split its shares as many as 11 times on a 2-for-1 basis from the time it went public in October 1970 to March 1999. An investor who had 100 shares at Wal-Mart’s IPO would have seen that little stake grow to 204,800 shares over the next 30 years"

If someone buys BTC in coinbase with fiat -&gt; uses that BTC to buy a product (sends that BTC to a merchant) -&gt; Merchant turns that BTC into fiat using Bitpay? 
First part to the question: So if the purchase of BTC costs the user 1%.  What benefits are there to the payer of using a no chargeback payment system and paying a 1% fee over using a CC with no fee to the payer and a chargeback system?  Not that anyone advocates chargebacks, but just stating the facts.  
Second part to the question.  This doesn't inject money into BTC market cap right?  Kind of like the Silk Road effect, where they assumed the dealers were cashing out into fiat, hence why there was little to no drop in price 1 week later.

I've replied to the founder's email earlier today.  The questionnaire he attached was very vague and didn't tell you anything concrete.  As an investor (which he is seeking) you dont know how much he is accepting or what your expected ROI will be, nor does he provide with even an approximated cost if you wanted to be a franchisee.  I am ALL about supporting this frontier, but I think we need a little more substance from bitcoinATM to establish what the plan is. Are some places like Cyprus better to start than here in the USA?  As much as I'd like to own a few in my area here in the USA, I think there are more areas in need.  Who will manufacture the machine?  What is the cost for leasing?  My point:  how are there 30 orders when all he did was send out a brief questionnaire gauging interests with no detail about anything else?  Just trying to be a realist here

agreed...there is a huge bottlenecking effect that is preventing mainstream to get into bitcoin, which in turn is affecting the price.  keep in mind, wall street nor mainstream investors have entered yet.  we need a scalable system that can keep up with demand and if bitcoins are so hard to get, they are going to lose value in the fact that it wont be worth the time/effort to get them UNLESS you need to send money across the globe, but I wholeheartedly believe that bitcoin is so much more than that

playing poker is not pure gambling if you are good you actually have an edge.  if you were hoping to get lucky and catch good cards and don't know how to play very well then that is gambling.  playing satoshi dice, where the house has a clear edge is gambling.  however, if you are skilled and can have an edge against your opponent, i'd like to look at it as betting with an edge.  its like investing in the stock market with more knowledge and tools at your fingertips than the general public.  so, one small sample size of losing a few bitcoins in poker does not mean never play poker again, especially to those that are good at it.

I don't see how this makes bitcoin look bad as the author mentions.  If a bank were to buy oranges with the savings/deposits and oranges tanked in demand/price then people wouldn't frown on oranges, they would frown on the malpractice performed by the institution still.  Right?

Great job with the site.  However, if we don't get the retailers to accept bitcoins themselves, then they wont give purchasers a few percent discount that they are saving by not dealing with credit card companies.  So is there a reasoning why someone would use bitfash intead of the zara site itself?  I'll admit, its probably a bit faster to pay.  Is there anything else?

I don't think you realize the significance of a "craze" in China (over 3x our population) which has capital controls.  The market cap alone could be doubled because of the Chinese craze alone.  Baidu is just a fraction of the press.  Don't forget about Paypal president thinking about adopting bitcoin in the press 2 days ago.  
I agree 200 may be a resistance point, but since it's not an all-time high so I'm less fearful than you.  
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:46:21
transfer your coins to another address, because if/when gox gives up your id to a fed in 2 yrs and they see that all the coins went from your gox acct to one single address it might raise some eyebrows...im not saying launder or be a felon but no one needs to know exactly how many fuckin bitcoins you own. protect your privacy

I think half is the perfect compromise and you'll still reap benefits of the upside and you'll still have a solid savings if it fails.  Still risky and no financial advisor would say that, but they are all brainwashed.  The people that take risks are the outliers that set themselves apart from the rest... Go for it but don't put it all on the line

I got my girlfriend interested and invested.  She bought some with about 1/4 of her savings account and I manage it for her.  She bought early so she's in the green and I downloaded the bitcoin ticker on her iphone and she checks it daily.  I mean, what's more exciting than seeing your money grow?  
I agree, we do need some female branding though.  If we could get zappos or someone in a female dominated industry to take it, it would be a huge start.

This is really cool.  Just signed up for an account.  They connect all the delivery places and all the delivery companies in your area.  The only annoying thing is their exchange rate is out of whack and is 72 when the price is actually 92 (the downside of a volatile currency).  So I will opt not to deposit bitcoin into my acct and convert it to foodler bucks or whatever the process is.

Coinbase released a quiz last week (i think its safe to talk about now) and one of the questions was along the lines of "how can you determine a transaction is valid with 0 confirmations" (i.e. in a supermarket checkout line)... my guess was to have a system that checks blockchain info to verify that the sending address has sufficient funds, then it will be assumed the payment source is a valid one, but I am unsure.  How can you verify transactions before they are confirmed?
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:44:04

what are your guys' thoughts on unloading your btcs anonymously through localbitcoins?  say you get audited 5 yrs from now and they see money left your acct to buy btcs 5 yrs prior...what can you say as a rebuttal if you unloaded them (i.e. i lost them when my computer broke, i gambled them away on gaming, i spent them all at bitcoinstore)?  sometimes i question paying double tax on my earned money
@_date: 2013-09-29 19:13:21

@_date: 2013-10-07 21:36:46
so the keys could be imported in bitcoin qt, for example?  
@_date: 2013-10-11 13:25:44
I think they're going for the feel such as checking out of a website using paypal, but instead you would be using coinbase.  If BTC becomes widely accepted, you should be able to make a transaction with BTC and have it just pull from your Coinbase balance and if not your linked bank acct.  And since there are no chargebacks and less fees, the website (Amazon) could easily drop the final price 4% and still be making the same profit.
So I dont think the intention in the long run is to make people go to coinbase, deposit money, then send the money to amazon.

I get what you're saying.  I have followed the stock market my entire life.  Never seen anything like this either and have doubts.  I think the fact that btc has acted so far as a safe haven for wealth gives it utility enough to justify its increasing price.  $2bn is nothing when it comes to wealth management.  It's like ONE small to medium hedge fund.  And with a Gox verification queue that is increasing and over 15k as of a couple days ago, I don't think the price is going down anytime soon.  And trust me, my stomach churns daily thinking about this and thinking about what you're saying.  It's a different animal man.

Why do people keep treating bitcoin like a security (stock, ETF, etc)?  It is not.  It is an unbelievable tool with amazing potential and the fact that it has gained all this exposure in the finance media worldwide helps people gain exposure to it at an exponential rate.  Do you really think a $1.2 Billion valuation is a god damn thing in the grand scheme of things?  The value is EXTREMELY LOW for what it is.  Stand pat.  Don't listen to all the haters, they just don't understand it yet.  Consider yourself privileged to be in this early at the $1.2 Billion mark.
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:05:26
Between my brother and I we have deposited a substantial portion of money into Bitfloor through bank wire (back when BTC = 60 USD), since my Gox account was pending stupid verification for weeks, Dwolla takes 7 light years to process payments and even when done CampBX wouldn't clear my account for GOD knows what reason, they took over 10 days to respond to my email.  Anyway Bitfloor helped us get in way earlier than we normally would have and so far BTCs have skyrocketed in value.  Their customer service has also been awesome too.  PLEASE RECONSIDER using them, THEY (Roman Shtylman) ARE LEGIT and run a tight ship.

Buy at the dips and use coinbase, since they get a very competitive rate for you.  Have your account verified and ready for the day there's some bad news (i.e. silk road shut down, an exchange gets hacked, or any other event that scares people into selling off).  Then buy immediately on a down spike.  You could've gotten it at $160 6 days ago.

hahahahaha that's even better
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:22:19
Definitely a debatable topic and I see your point regarding nutrients.  I've researched the topic a lot and found arguments for both sides.  The one sheer fact that should be noted is that inorganic produce (once again depending on what you consider organic or what the FDA allows people to call organic) contains pesticides that are meant to be water resistant that we don't know the long term effects of.  I've taken many courses on environmental runoff and the magnitude of damage caused by pesticides.  That alone, for the safety of my long term health, makes me want to pay extra for what I know is not sketchy.  Mark's Daily Apple is a pretty good blog discussing this issue:
Once again, each is entitled to their own opinion and I'm glad we don't live in a country without options to choose from regarding where we can shop!

Playing devils advocate: 
1. Setting up an account is not convenient.  They usually make you sit down with a banker and ask you a bunch of questions and sign a bunch of docs.  Then they litter your home with bank mail.  
2. If you want to buy a lot of bitcoins, it will require a lot more cash in which the bank will have to have on hand.  Often times they dont have that much cash on hand.  And setting up an account to buy $500 worth of bitcoin just doesn't seem efficient.  (my opinion)  
3. Often times banks will not let you withdraw your entire bank account balance in cash, they usually close your account by issuing a bank issued cashiers check from my experience.  So that being said, I wouldn't want to fund my random bank account with more money than I want to withdraw just to make this face to face btc transaction.
4. You will be recorded on camera.  Could be good or bad.

do your research, because yes you are paying a premium, but organic (depending on how the word is classified) products have more nutritional value and are healthier.  you can taste the difference in many veggies I buy at whole foods/farmers markets vs. chain grocery stores that are GMO

i used to research stocks and market timing and not that this is exactly related, but stocks drop 3x faster than they go up...so if a stock gained for 3 days straight, the gains would be gone in one trading day on average.  with bitcoin's volatility i would say that can be on the magnitude of 10x, so its something to keep in mind...i'm a huge believer, just sayin.
thats a cool piece of info though, i didn't know that

If an investor buys into Second Market trust, are they directly buying new coins and making bitcoins more scarce, or existing Second Market coins that they used to establish the trust?
Anyone know the answer?

6 is a small sample.  Bitcoin is looked at primarily as an investment at this time, but it will be considered more mainstream once those types of people have heard of it.  It's benefits haven't really translated to the everyday people yet, but it will soon

fair point.

Yep.  I pride myself on being unlike 99% of people.  The idea of being like everyone else scares me.
