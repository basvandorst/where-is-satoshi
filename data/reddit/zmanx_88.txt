I was basing it on this 
However you're right its hard to know, there could be shared addresses, some of the biggests could be exchange addresses that hold everyones money

It's a little hypocritical that he uses google then

I think the perspective you're missing is that, even if bitcoin was in a bubble, it doesn't matter. 
There are enough people using it for non-investing reasons that it doesn't matter. It won't "pop" to zero. There are legit use cases, specially in third world countries where it is used in interesting ways. Places like venezuela, where their currency is losing value. Miners who help keep the system running use their income to pay bills, buy real physical items. There is a young economy here, it's not all speculation. 
Your point regarding max circulating supply not being important because of other cryptos is valid.. but just look at gold. Gold is still traded, even though there's silver, oil, diamonds, etc.
The world won't belong to a single currency, BTC will just be one of many currencies.

yup.. I'm scratching this ^.^

what a poetic answer!
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:21:00
It was only an announcement by an incredibly incompetent government. As far as I know, the currency has not yet been released. there’s no official website, github, or whitepaper explaining it.

congratulations ! you are now one step closer to freedom. Having no mortgage due will give you freedom to rise even higher!!!

We used to celebrate bitcoins climb at every 1k increment...  The atmostphere has changed. I would've been happy with bitcoin staying at 10k, now I feel it's all happening wayy to fast... When I see btc climb another 1k I just feel concerned.
As for me, I withdrew most of my initial investment which I reinvested in other cryptos. So if shit hits the fan I'm not too concerned about myself, but I am concerned about the industry altogether. I want this to succeed ! ! ! Bitcoin needs to release lightning network soon! we NEED to scale

Do it, and get back in by dollar cost average
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:09:58
that's pretty cool. I never noticed this feature!
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:11:00
thanks for your perspective, makes a lot of sense now why coinbase is doing so well. Cool thing is, other exchanges will copy from coinbase's success and strive to make things easier. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:29:59
you're totally right... then the issue pointed below of people entering wallets.. hmm.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:33:57
the market didn't give 2 craps about the nicehash hack... isn't that crazy?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:14:20
Why is no one making memes anymore? I miss them... is everyone shitting their pants?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:33:06
dude! I'm no longer excited by these 1k climbs... I'm just like "WTF is happening!! stop!!" can it just stay at 10k for 3 months?
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:31:18
yup, didn't think this thoroughly enough... even if I charged a fee to register in the lottery, how can we ensure hat there's only 1 wallet address per participant? ughh.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:32:31
I hope you're right !

have you heard the gold analogy? that's what made the most sense to me. Bitcoins are just generated by the bitcoin software which runs on many nodes around the world. 
They are generated by running a sort of 'gold rush' simulation. 
It becomes harder and harder to generate, the more miners the harder it is to get. There is a limited amount available just like gold.
did that do anything for you? I'm sort of new here trying to contribute
* Edit: its kinda hard not to get technical with this
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:58:43
Thanks for putting this together! I am looking to learn more about the possibilities of programming transactions.
Also, something that still bothers me... 
what guarantees that all bitcoin nodes aren't shut down? 
for example, your bank accounts are usually protected by the FDIC up to 250k in case the bank goes bankrupt. 
if everyone decides to shut down their bitcoin nodes, my $ will go gone?

inflation is so bad there, if people just convert their wage to bitcoin it retains more value and it's more stable than the bolivar

I talked with my cousin who still resides in Venezuela. He knows people who are mining while using free electricity.
He's scared to join in because they've arrested bitcoin miners already
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:34:41
I reeally need to get my money out of exchanges, but I feel anxious about it because I'm historically bad at not losing stuff !!!
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:11:41
I don't fckin like coinbase anymore, bitpay support warns against buying stuff through it because it is slower than any other wallet.
I had an issue where I tried to buy a product and the timer expired, transaction went through AFTER it failed. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:10:19
I'm not going to lie I'm also scared for him ! 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:28:18
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:27:10
do you use it buy goods and services? I don't think we're at mass adoption yet. Fees are high and network is slow.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:21:53
The idea that banks have been benefiting from my money by re-investing and loaning is SICKENING ! ! Why don't they share their profits with me?
That's why I love storing my $ in bitcoin. I have FULL CONTROL of it.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:28:12
Are you trolling?

Hola soy un venezolano viviendo en florida y estoy buscando formas de ayudar a mi pueblo... Te mandé un poco de bitcoin. Quisiera aprender más sobre el uso de bitcoin en Venezuela. compras comida con bitcoin? Hay comerciantes en la calle aceptando bitcoin?
