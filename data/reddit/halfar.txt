What the darn-diddily-doodily did you just say about me, you little witcharooney? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class at Springfield Bible College, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret mission trips in Capital City, and I have over 300 confirmed baptisms. I am trained in the Old Testament and I’m the top converter in the entire church mission group. You are nothing to me but just another heathen. I will cast your sins out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in Heaven, mark my diddily-iddilly words. You think you can get away with saying that blasphemy to me over the Internet? Think again, friendarino. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of evangelists across Springfield and your IP is being traced by God right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggorino. The storm that wipes out the diddily little thing you call your life of sin. You’re going to Church, kiddily-widdily. Jesus can be anywhere, anytime, and he can turn you to the Gospel in over infinity ways, and that’s just with his bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in preaching to nonbelievers, but I have access to the entire dang- diddily Bible collection of the Springfield Bible College and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your sins away off the face of the continent, you diddily-doo satan-worshipper. If only you could have known what holy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you from the Heavens, maybe you would have held your darn-diddily-fundgearoo tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re clean of all your sins, you widdillo-skiddily neighborino. I will sing hymns of praise all over you and you will drown in the love of Christ. You’re farn-foodily- flank-fiddily reborn, kiddo-diddily.

I actually just meant how it's being promoted right here on this thread, to me. I'm not sure anybody has really "promoted" it to me irl. 
@_date: 2015-07-30 03:44:32
The internet isn't a commodity to be valued, though. AFAIK, there isn't a price tag on the internet. It's infrastructure, not a currency.
@_date: 2015-07-30 04:09:49
So in that scenario, the value is only increased through steady pariticipation drop-out? Isn't that sorta the same thing? The more people hoard, the more valuable your bitcoins become.

a pretty fucking big "whatever"
don't you think?
you have successfully raised a lot more alarms than you intended to do. What *is* stopping terrorists and other... bad guys, from being anonymously funded by using bitcoin? It seems to me like your friend not getting magic cards is an acceptable price to pay for cutting off a crystal clear avenue towards funding dangerous people. 
@_date: 2015-07-30 03:38:37
So the shopkeeper of bitcoins tries to increase demand for his business by bringing his coworkers into the fold, if I'm understanding that right. That still sounds like a Kirby/Cutco business model, to be honest, except the guy above is making money by being a middle-man, and nothing else.
Doesn't bitcoin require an internet connection? That seems to be a huge knife in its back as far as widespread use, goes. Lose your connection; lose your money. Most people can't access it to begin with, and it can never be a worldwide currency until **everyone** already has all of the set-up needed, including the internet.
It **definitely** sounds like it's way more investment than currency. And when it's promoted for the sake of earning more money, and not for the features you *very* briefly mentioned, it becomes a pyramid scheme. People aren't being brought onto bitcoin for minimal fees and immutable ledgers; they're buying into bitcoin because they believe the price will rise and they'll earn money in the process. At least, that's how it's being sold to me right now.
@_date: 2015-07-30 03:03:41
Yeah, so I'm actually brand new here, but I'm gonna go ahead and just say that kinda sounds like a pyramid scheme. Suggesting they'll be able to make money if they invest now and get more people on board... the fact that *you* profit from more people joining...
Isn't bitcoin supposed to be a *currency*, and not an investment?
It sounds like what a Kirby Vacuum recruiter once told me; how he started at the bottom and now he's making a ton of money running his own Kirby operation, and I should join his team so I can do the same thing, except there was a tangible product at the end.
@_date: 2015-07-30 07:19:36
Well, okay, be a giant douchebag, I'm sure that'll attract people to the things you care about.
@_date: 2015-07-30 03:19:20
A commodity? A commodity is a raw resource to be processed. I understand that bitcoins are "mined", but that just makes it analogous to gold, which wasn't a *commodity* when it was the standard.
And the fact that an organization has reputable backers doesn't legitimize it; everyone should know better than that. Legitimate organizations can, and often do, make very risky decisions.
@_date: 2015-07-30 19:39:56
Buddy, there is a time and a place for insults, and this is most *definitely* one of them. You've got a lot to learn yourself, moron. *Just being honest.*
@_date: 2015-07-30 03:42:40


Can you elaborate on this? If there are say, 100 bitcoins, and 1000 people, and neither statistic change over a period of time, how is any profit/investment made?
@_date: 2015-07-30 03:41:09


Well, actually, my question is just a follow-up to that. 
Since you view bitcoin as an investment, how would it gain value without increased participation?
@_date: 2015-07-30 10:13:21
Thanks for the old history lesson, but "produces more stuff" is a part of what I meant when I said "increased participation", so I guess I worded that question poorly... and you shouldn't make assumptions like "this product hasn't been getting wealthier the past few years", it weakens the stronger parts of what you're saying.
@_date: 2015-07-30 03:22:55
Do you believe it is necessary to bring more participation (either through bigger individual investments or more investors) in order for you to make more of a profit on this investment?
@_date: 2015-07-30 03:11:53
Do you view bitcoin as an investment, or a way to earn money?
