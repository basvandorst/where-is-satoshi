I would argue that the internet has no intrinsic value because it is just a protocol that we use to communicate with, and that any other protocol could be developed to do the same thing in a similar way. As such the post office and telecom providers have real intrinsic value because they own tangible things such as real estate, office buildings, office supplies, etc. This does not mean that intrinsic value is an accurate measure of protocols and their potential impact on society.

That's just a theory. Demand isn't based on punishing you for saving, it's based on needs/wants. People NEED to be able to save money at a certain rate as well. It isn't good if people over consume. Inflationary monetary policy doesn't always increase spending. Besides inflation rate calculations are also very biased and can't be explicitly proven to be accurate because the value of goods and services also fluctuate. Spending is more likely based on confidence than Fucking inflation. If everyone started living paycheck to paycheck it's not like that's a good thing. Whether it's one household or all of them, you don't spend money based on inflation unless inflation is a problem.

Correct, but it would be impossible to buy them all for the above reason but a majority would be possible I suppose. 1 million coins purchased would take 1 coin a second for about 30 days but I think that reduce almost all liquidity because roughly only 1 million coins are available on all exchanges at the current moment. That pressure would bid the price up exponentially I would guess before the next tier of sellers moved their coins to market.

People's expectations have a greater effect on price than anything based in reality. While bitcoin is still a speculative bet buyers and sellers are much more emotionally driven and will have strong reactions based on their feelings.

It's about ownership and identity. Who has to know what is being done, who is doing it, and who benefits. I don't own my money in my bank. The bank owns it. I need to give up all my private data to use the bank.  If I want to go help visa or the bank they have to hire me which is not to difficult but still lots of barriers to entry. Not to even get started with regulation/government if I really want to do something important. So I am voiceless and probably will never be a part of any of these things that greatly effect my life. Or I can go mine some crypto and run a node or help a dev project and keep some of my data private by never having to give it up.

Most likely you don't have a use case for crypto. This technology has a promise of creating future use cases that don't yet exist for most people who only use finances at a low level in a small network. Bitcoin won't really help you buy a hotdog at the gas station or collect a standard salary paycheck. But it will help with remittances, fund settlements, securities transactions and counter party risk factors. Also assuming you live in a nice place with economic stability you probably don't wait in long lines at the bank hoping you can get cash before they run out or the exchange rate falls by double digits.
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:53:23

Couldnt you say that all currency is a natural monopoly because the issuing authority is a single source that interferes with competition. Why wouldn't this argument apply to all currency?
Also bitmain selling equipment is not the same as owning the mint.
 You are arguing two opposing view points, that it is a monopoly and that their are no barriers to entry meaning perfect competition. These apparent contradictions should not exist if your arguments are valid.
Furthermore claiming no one can argue against you isn't a strong claim. It just means you refuse to see opposing arguments as valid... which means you may have issues.

Actually I would say it was much more optimistic then. I think as things grow in size later adoption brings in more skeptical people to the network. So the community will naturally become more pessimistic. But its good as more logic engineer types seem to be more skeptical so you will get better coders and project builders as it goes on. Also as these price swing make and break people financially it leaves many bitter. Some of them may take this personal and campaign to save others from their plight hanging around to turn others away from potential failure.

What's interesting is that this implies that Newton's attempt to create gold taught him to reliable identify the primary properties of gold, hence he knew whether something was or was not gold and to which extent.

I think you could have went further with this great analogy. 
Something to the effect of baby bear bear (twitch kiddy) had to many altcoins, momma bear (financial encumbents) had no coins, and daddy bear (bear whale) had to many coins.
Hodlilocks went to the bear market and bought up all baby bears coins and it was just right. She didn't buy from momma bear who standing on the corner selling her old things. She couldn't buy all of daddy bears coins so she had to call up her family the HODLERS to help her. It took some time but once the hodlers got there they bought all the daddy bears coins. The bear market was scary and seemed to last forever but once the HODLERS bought all the coins the bears went back to the woods to hibernate.
Something like that.

What if we just started calling bitcoin money and everything else fiat.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:15:14
It is because mining isn't instant profit. In the future the bitcoins you mined will be worth the trouble of mining them. It is not profitable in the short term. How much did the people mining .01 cent coins make in 2010? Now they are selling them. Mining is future profit not instant returns.
If you want to make instant money don't mine.

Just announce it as a bitcoin split then those who don't understand can figure it out themselves. Stocks splitting always get informational dumps to explain the process.

Bitcoin has survived everything so far. It is a bit depressing when you come off the high. However this is still only the beginning. Things will not happen quickly. I went through the last crash it was rough, but I held on through it.
I have no faith in other currency or commodities to bring about the future I desire. Thus I must believe in bitcoin without doubt.

Essentially bitcoin prevents friction and creates freedom. The intrinsic value of bitcoin is greater financial freedom. However this is still the early days of the technology. I suspect that in the next few years many changes will come to both infrastructure and the protocol itself. This will allow it to grow beyond the current horizon.

This is a great idea. We just need to write a proposal and get all the facts together. I am sure this will get funded. This is what the bitcoin foundation should be doing:(

Eventually no one will cash out their bitcoins in mass. This isn't a stock, it is currency and you can spend it, and one day get payed in it.

People are incentivized to spend money based on their wants and needs not based off of inflation or deflation. The velocity of bitcoin is probably 100 times that of a normal currency anyway so circulation aka currency would be much greater. Deflation is only a problem in our current system where money is debt. If people could afford to save and buy things outright the entire world would go bust because the fractional reserve banking system does not work that way. We have to spend all our money and then go into debt so that new money can be created to pay the interest.

You would have loans set to another currencies value or with negative interest rates. Until volatility decreases loans are not practical. Until bitcoin becomes mainstream this is unlikely.

It doesn't matter few of those people will hold onto all those bitcoins as the price rises. people will begin to sell/use bitcoins as the price rises. Besides that is still better than USD were less than that own more than that.

Bitcoin is an ideal. What we are finding out from bitcoin is that money is primarily faith based, that is why we have used so many things as money. As far as intrinsic value goes I don't own any gold and I probably never will other than a few wedding rings my family doesn't own any gold. I only know one person who has gold as a store of value. That being said Gold has been confiscated twice by the united states government so as a US citizen I have no intention of ever owning gold because they will just take it from me or come looking for me when they can't pay their bills. 
Alt coins: Crypto currency  is a lot like electricity in the sense that infrastructure has to be put in place. Also branding is a huge deal in any space given these two combinations bitcoin has an advantage. 
Nearsightedness is probably the biggest threat to adoption. People are very reluctant to speculate into the future and base their entire existence on the immediate scope of their attention span. As such their are many people that will not partake of new innovations until it is a non positive connotation not to do so.
