Is Bitcoin for people that live on less than $2 a day right now? No.
Might Bitcoin be useful for such people in future? Yes, if with that amount of money you can have a basic phone with a Bitcoin app, and a big enough chunk of the society you live in wants to transact using Bitcoin.

I don't think it's possible to send a message to a wallet.
The last Bitcoins will be mined sometime around 2140. If Bitcoin is still relevant then, I expect the value of the transaction fees will be well worth the effort/energy of continuing to run the hardware. Humanity will likely have orders of magnitude more computing power by then, and hopefully in those 120+ years we will have made technological advancements that make energy much cheaper and renewable.

If BTC goes to zero, I will buy all of them.

We've got banks/fiat for where regulation is desirable. One of the main attractions of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is that they are outside the control of national governments.
Regulating centralised exchanges however might not be a bad thing.

On 4th August 2018, my guess is the market rate for one Bitcoin will be $20,500.

For Bitcoin specifically, it won't be worthwhile. Maybe try another cryptocurrency which doesn't have ASICs, such as Vertcoin.

I am in a similar position - I am a developer that wants to move into working with blockchain technologies. Doing this course is one thing I can do to show I am serious about it.

Yes, I'm on this course currently. So far it has mostly covered stuff I had already picked up based on reading forum posts, documentation, looking at source code etc.
I'd still recommend it though. It's a solid introduction to Bitcoin and blockchain.

I don't know for sure, but I suspect some people are paid to do so.
A search for "reddit crypto" on Upwork shows there are plenty of people paying for individuals to promote (unnamed) cryptocurrencies on Reddit. It would not surprise me at all if some of those jobs involve bashing Bitcoin.
