Not quite. The new law merely reversed an out of date and almost forgotten 1870s statute that had, mistakenly, made “alternative payment methods” illegal. Remember, we’re talking vintage 19 th century alternative payment methods. It had gone, basically, unnoticed for 140 years, the ban was never enforced and there doesn’t seem ever to have been a prosecution under the old law. Put simply, no one cared that alternative payment methods weren’t supposed to be used. Which is why, for the state’s politicians, voting yes on this was a no brainer. After all, California’s Silicon Valley is where so much work is being done on today’s alternative payment methods and many venture capitalists happen to make heavy- weight political contributions. Signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown, the bill officially redefines alternative payment methods as, “Digital currency, points, coupons or other objects of monetary value.” In other words, by statute in California, bitcoin is akin to frequent flyer miles, supermarket loyalty cards, and credit card points.

Here are some tips that I have applied to my selling of bitcoins to weed out the scammers:
-I recommend selling .1 at a time.
-Put the listing up for auction.
-Ebay email and Paypal email must match.
-Feedback percentage must be 100%.
-They must have 15 or more positive feedback ratings.(Read the feedback because sometimes people put negative feedback and submit it as positive.)
-Their address must be confirmed on ebay.
-They must be verified on paypal.
-Print out a receipt of paypal transaction and of blockchain transaction and mail it to the buyer's address. (The reason to do this is because first if they request a chargeback after I have sent them their bitcoin, Paypal will side in my favor because there is a tracking number. Second, if you haven't made more than 25 sales it will sit for 20+ days on paypal because you can transfer it to your bank. By mailing a receipt, you can access your funds between 3-7 days.
-Email them a verification code and tell them to message it through ebay.(Eliminates scammers that use stolen paypal accounts)

But paypal will go in your favor because there was a paper trail that something was shipped and delivered.
