Up to a five percent fee would be more than worth it, pushing my miles into the top tier. 
Plus I actively use BTC and sell locally, so I won't take a huge hit.

Ouch, that 23.9% fee.

Nope, unfortunately.

At this point it doesn't matter, they are essentially gone.  I have one more old drive to dump, it had 10 bitcoins in it from mining back in the day.  Too bad it crashed.  I am going to use the freezer method and see what I can pull.

Any resources, including some of the hex information for .dat files would be greatly appreciated.

I tried pywallet and it didnt dump the JSON.  However, I am not well versed in python, so I might have done it wrong.
I compared a real wallet with the other wallet in a hex editor and the plaintext in the real wallet never occurs in the other wallet.

I have sent my drive into a forensics lab. 
They did a full backup of what was a lot of porn and corrupt files. 
Not sure how much detail they went into. I will reconsider it. I don't really have another grand I don't want to save.

Agreed, I sent it to a forensics lab and got no luck from them. They felt bad and luckily didn't charge me an insane amount of money.

Same happened to me. I had about 300 bitcoin on a hard drive that shit the pan.

I used a forensics lab. Got a lot of corrupt files and some porn.
