The difficulty adjustment is only taking the block generation time into account, not the backlog in the mempool? So how should the situation ever get better then? Maybe when BCH has it‘s next halving and hashpower is moving back to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:12:44
Will the difficulty drop or increase the next days? 
Searching the internet provides different resuts/estimations on that.
If the difficulty is increasing, ist there ever a chance that the mempool is clearing and Bitcoin gets back to „normal“ tx fees?

The number of mainnet nodes is increasing rapidly.

Within the Trezor app you can now buy cryptocoins with credit card.
I‘ve not tested it so far but it seems to be a easy way to buy.

Show them the great videos in the introduction post of the Bitcoin sub. 
@_date: 2019-10-06 16:39:44
On the model T you can do it directly on the device.
@_date: 2019-10-06 16:36:49
OP, don‘t get me wrong, I agree with most of the content in your video but It should be made a little more serious.
Flying dollar bills and a spooky voice is probably not the best way to promote mass adoption. The video gives the impression of brainwashing.

Thanks! Unfortunately no shipping outside US. ☹️

Where can I get one of these?

I am also highly interested to support Bitcoin with hashpower.  I don‘t want to see that shit, that happend last Weekend, again.
Which hardware would be the best to mine with in environments like slushpool or nicehash?

He is talking about cryptoSTEEL, not a paper seedword list.  ��

Interesting, as far as I know they are already cooperating with Bitwala to offer that service.��

The GDPR is intended to protect the peoples data and privacy. 
Bitcoin is the peoples money, owned by the people, not by any company. 
From my point of view the GDPR is not applicable. Whom du you want to sue? The BTC owners? The Miners? 
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:25:19
Not in Austria. The gains are tax free after one year. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:46:09
The GDPR definitely needs to be revised. ��
Thanks for your answers.
@_date: 2019-01-15 04:07:17
Maybe a stupid question. I also tried the blue wallet LN and I am trying to get the money back to the regular BTC wallet. Where can I find the Lightning „BTC refund adress or invoice“ adress in blue ledger? I don‘t want to make a mistake.
Many thanks in advance!
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:44:04
Hmm, very interesting discussion. ��
Paypal is also not really anonymous, at least the seller/buyer has my personal data. 
Please correct me if I am wrong, according to the GDPR i have the right to request the deletion of all transactions made so far at my bank or from Paypal? 
You might be right that the processor of the data can be sued (e.g. the miners), but in this case minig will be dine completely outside europe in the future.
However, from my point of view the GDPR is a perfect sample of a regulation that was intended to help the people but completely fails in this extend. 
May I ask you where you live and what your job is? 
There are not many people outside having experience with the GDPR. ��
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:11:03
No, it does not contain personal data (e.g. name, address,...) 
If you decide to publish your BTC address it‘s your personal decision.
It‘s like crying out your name loudly in the public and sueing everybody for not forgetting your personal data. 
The GDPR aims at data stored at companies.
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:08:24
Deleting data out of a blockchain is not possible. 
I think the authors of the GDPR ignored the blockchain technology.
However, if they start to sue each and every trx processor they will have no time left to audit all the companies. So good luck to whoever is in charge of that. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:37:10
What do you think? Will a BTC owner get in trouble after April simply by owning BTC?
What if he is selling or buying BTC?
How do you see trading platforms within the EU?Will they be illegal after May?
@_date: 2019-01-15 17:26:07
Thank you, but it‘s still not working.
If I leave the „BTC refund adress or invoice“ field blank I get an error message. 
Where can I find this adress in blue wallet?
Many thanks!
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:43:21
The GDPR is not relevant for blockchains that are not storing personal data. So for BTC or other „pure“ digital currencies everything is fine.
Blockchains like ETH might get an issue with the GDPR.
@_date: 2019-01-15 08:04:29
Thank you. But how? ��
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:17:03
Imagine I have bought a product from a private person via ebay and paid it via PayPal. 
If I request the deletion of my personal data or account from PayPal they also have to delete my personal data in the sellers account (name, shipping address, ...)? If yes, this might be an issue for the seller, especially if it is a company (tax, transparency, ..)
How will the EU prevent the processing of transactions within the european doimain? I don’t see any possibility to do so.
@_date: 2017-10-08 06:18:39
Thanks for your opinion and risking downvotes. I really appreciate it. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:35:36
Depends on the price. ��
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:37:18
Thx a lot for your extensive answer. I get the reasons of bad code an risks for user funds, but how can anybody „control“ a decentralized blockchain? Is it because they provide the code?

Thanks to all, I think I finally got it. I love Reddit and of course Bitcoin. I will not support Segwit2x. 
Soooo what is the best strategy now to keep the coins safe? Store them on a hardware wallet (like Trezor or Ledger) until the dust settles? 
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:26:33
Thanks for the fast response. 
But why is that a bad thing? Are the new developers trying to harm Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-04 17:51:38
Unfortunately not. You need to create a new wallet an transfer your coins.

Ok, I see. Big blocks are the problem because they lead to centralization. 
But why the hell did BCH increased the size to 8MB? ��
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:03:50
Is it actually (before Aug. 1st) safe to transfer money from one wallet to another? e.g. Ledger nano to Trezor or from a trading platform to the Trezor?
Many thanks in advance!
@_date: 2017-07-23 11:05:16
Hey, this is just a coin with a B. There is no private key on it. ��Thus it has no value! 
I bought it just because I love bitcoin. ��Just for fun ��
@_date: 2017-07-23 10:43:50
Does anybody know when the BTC wallets might be unlocked again? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:53:30
Thanks a lot ��
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:18:25
Looks very promising. I will go in for a last trade before the BTC freeze. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 07:46:06
You can find it on Ali.
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:30:49
Thanks, I know this link already. A simple yes or no would be sufficient. Thanks in advance! ��
@_date: 2017-07-23 07:31:09
Does that mean that you will have two wallets with the same amount on your bittrex account in case of a hard fork? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:40:01
Thanks, but still not aswered. ��
Will I have two wallets with the same amount of coins in it? 
E.g. I have 10 BTC initialy --&gt; after the hard fork I will have 10 legacy BTC AND 10 BTCCash in a seperate wallet? 
Or will I have one of the wallets depending on the choice of bittrex? 
Angain, many thanks in advance. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:23:16
These damn BCH fork leaders are destroying the reputation and trust in cryptocurrencies just to push their own shitcoins. They don‘t care about others.
I really hope the actual bear market wipes out these shitcoins so everybody can focus on the real values of satoshi again.
