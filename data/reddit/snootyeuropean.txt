Taking profits is okay. Selling everything because you're intimidated by the gains and think "it can't possibly go even higher" has been the wrong decision since $1000. (Even tho in that case, selling the top and buying back in later was definitely the smartest thing to do.)

Intrinsic value is a pretty dated concept in economic theory. The problem is that value is never universal (maybe you think apples have intrinsic value, but if I'm allergic to apples I wouldn't pay you even 1 cent per kilo (other than to sell them to someone else who values them more)), and if you try to make it universal you'll end up at nonsense like "how much labour does it take to produce", which doesn't work on many levels.
Subjective value, on the other hand, actually works great as the foundation for better economic models based on people's individual behaviour. And it doesn't have trouble explaining the valuation of non-physical things like Bitcoin, because plenty of people are obviously stoked for it.

That's putting the cart before the horse. Miners are willing to pay high electricity bills because Bitcoin is that valuable, not the other way around.
If I [spend $1500 to make a sandwich in the least efficient way possible]( that doesn't mean the sandwich is now worth $1500 and anyone will buy it from me for that price.
Unless they *really* like the idea of a hand-crafted sandwich I guess.
But basically, ["real" value isn't a thing]( – value is always subjective.

Brigaded by whom? This subreddit has 5x more subscribers than "the other one". Maybe stop being so paranoid and accept that this isn't great news, and people (yes, normal people, not shills or bots) aren't particularly happy about it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:04:14
You're right that I haven't been around here much... so yeah, I wasn't familiar with that.
Still though, there's a fine line to be found here somewhere -
 because, again, this sub has by far the most subscribers and active users, and at some point you're just conflating any non-positive comment from a regular with BCH propaganda.
I don't think BCH is a viable alternative (mostly because it lacks vision and developers with more talent than a toilet bowl), but I do think we should be free to talk about BTC's problems anyway.

It *is* a last resort that's only gaining traction because the Core developers are too caught up in their ideological walled garden to still *do their job* and keep the network performing well.


It should be impossible for the majority of users to install a client that they prefer?


There is no way for people to communicate with each other... on the internet? Is that what you're saying?


Great comparison. For example, imagine if some government were to force Blockstream to install a backdoor in Core. Now, thanks to Bitcoin being decentralised, this isn't a major concern because the majority of users can always decide to install an alternative client without a backdoor. That's what a hard fork is.


Like how it emerges when the majority of people start supporting Classic?
Now the 'game theory' bit...




How exactly is that applicable? What do I *gain* from using Classic? What is my "increased reward"? What is your "reduced reward"? You don't lose any coins. In fact, there is no perceivable difference for you at all. You're just going to have to download a different software version to be on the main network. Or you can do your own thing on the forked-off part of the network. *(Or both!)*
And one thing that doesn't seem to be clear to you at all:
**Game theory is about actual, quantifiable incentives that serve as the basis for rational decisionmaking. It simply doesn't work like "Party A *views* political change X negatively, therefore X is a loss for A".**


Just... what kind of logic is this? How does a fork constitute centralisation, but the same small group of Core developers being in charge of Bitcoin for the rest of eternity somehow *does not*?
And as you already write: a fork can always happen again, in case the Classic developers do a bad job. And nothing stops you from taking part in the vote and, perhaps, reinstating Blockstream. There is no "run away centralization" as you put it. A fork does not exclude anyone from influencing future decisionmaking.
It only *decentralises* the whole leadership of Bitcoin because it means the power is with the users, not the developers. That's why Satoshi came up with it in the first place.
Edit: Removed some provocative wording to increase the chances that people actually read my comment before downvoting it. Still, this is some serious nonsense.

Do you have any kind of refutation to offer?
@_date: 2016-01-21 10:17:28


That's the fallacy. They're locking themselves into Classic just as little as they were previously locked into Core. If Classic turns out to be as incompetent as you claim (which is unlikely with both Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik on board, and the possibility to selectively hire more people), they can still make the switch back to Core or to a 3rd party with another fork. Nothing prevents the previous Core supporters from helping to facilitate that.

Uhh... what? FUD is a propaganda method used by people who want to discredit something. This is not FUD. Hearn is a respected guy in the community, he has done more for Bitcoin than you ever will. You shouldn't suddenly dismiss everything he says just because it's not what you wanted to hear.
@_date: 2016-01-21 11:30:14
What leads you to think that they would just throw away their ASICs and stop mining Bitcoin? All it takes is one download and they're mining on Classic. It's not even mutually exclusive with supporting Core on separate hardware if they so desire.
And no, the Core chain wouldn't need to be forked. The Classic chain would be forked to run either on a modified (SHA256) version of the Core *software*, or on something else. But that's purely hypothetical at this point, considering that the two most experienced Bitcoin developers out there are working on Classic.
And your second paragraph really encapsulates the whole issue. Forks aren't the problem, the separation of people into camps with pointless animosity between them is the problem.

That's like calling someone closed-minded for not buying into homeopathy, or spiritual healing, or pizzagate. The ability to discern sensible from idiotic things is not the same thing as closed-mindedness.
Though people lacking in critical thinking skills obviously tend to have trouble with that distinction. And people supporting populists do so because they lack critical thinking skills. So yeah, it all makes sense. Have fun falling for snakeoil salesmen for the rest of your life.

Are you aware of the drama surrounding Calvin Ayre and Craig Wright?
@_date: 2019-04-14 09:24:12
Calvin Ayre is one of the founders of BSV ("Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision"), the result of a contentious hardfork from Bcash, together with Craig Steven Wright (CSW). Recently the two have been going around claiming CSW is Satoshi Nakamoto, and have started to sue people who called him a fraud (which he definitely is). I posted this tweet because it's funny to see Ayre get a taste of his own medicine. I'm not a fan of McAfee's, but this is entertaining nonetheless.

Okay, it sounded like you were saying the individual chance (p) per attempt rises, which it doesn't. The overall probability P of winning at least once rises with the number of attempts, yes.
The energy you've put into computing non-winning hashes still doesn't contribute to anything though (not even network difficulty). It's valid to say that it's wasted.

It doesn't mine, it just verifies. So once it has caught up and is synced, all it has to do is a) check that new transactions are valid as it receives them from its peers, and b) check the hash of a single block header every 10 minutes.
