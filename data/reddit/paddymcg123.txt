I get slightly annoyed but not scared, but then again I can actually afford to lose what I've invested.

NEM was insane, the speed that pole went flying could have seriously fucked someone up.

[Here's] ( a clip from it where I thought he wasn't taking it seriously at all. 
Don't get me wrong, I watch his podcasts all the time and I love them but I wish he'd be more serious when his guests are trying to get serious points across.

Yep, I just got the email off coinbase. At least I know it works now it's definitely worth it to avoid those ridiculous fees.

I haven't heard back from coinbase but I read this on their website " Depending on your bank, it may take one to two business days for the funds to flow between banks and enter our system. **Additionally, it may take two to three business days to clear on our end**" I'll give it to the end of the week before I start to worry.

Joe comes across as very douchey in  he just makes a joke about everything Andreas says.

Sticky this forever, these are exciting times and it's human nature to want to share exciting events in your life. Unfortunately that's a terrible idea when it comes to Bitcoin, it's always a bad idea to tell anyone anything about the bitcoin that you own, as soon as you do that you have just painted a target on the back of your head. I know I sound like a tin foil hat wearing nut job but you need a certain level of paranoia when you become your own bank.

Is this possible on Mac? I've got 16gb ram but only a 2nd gen dual core i5.

Okay I've added the config file and relaunched bitcoin but I don't notice any difference.
Activity monitor says it's using 600MB memory and I have 10.7GB cached, not sure if it did anything? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:27:19
Sorry I've been out of the loop for about 5 years, I have no idea what that even means. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:32:36
Debug says cache is 1.2GB (memory is 1.35GB now) does this mean it's working but just very slowly? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:07:37
Okay, thanks for the info. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:51:15
Awesome, thanks for your help.
