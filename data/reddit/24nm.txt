Many people didn't realize that the total cost of your order needed to be over $300 (or $500) *before* taxes and shipping.

It's sad to see so many people immediately post some quick line of text, and then paste in their bitcoin address without reading the OPs post. I am embarrassed for the subreddit. I'm sorry, OP.

You're generally correct. Attacks like this prompt the user to click a real Google Document link, which opens a document pretending to be the Google sign-in page. Naturally, some users will enter their credentials without realizing the document will just submit them to the document owner. It's unfortunate, but for users who rush and don't pay attention, it can be a successful phishing attack.

That's... not how electricity works. A device will only draw what it needs. Remember Ohms Law? V = I * R, so I = V / R. As long as your power supply can supply at least the maximum current a load will draw, it will be fine. You cannot "give it too many amps".

Hate to be "that guy", but you can clearly see the sidebar since you found the "Submit a link/post" button. I suggest you actually read the sidebar, and then come back with any specific questions you have. Everything you need to know is right in front of you.
