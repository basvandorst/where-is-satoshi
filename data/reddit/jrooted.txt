... won't let me set up an account unless I'm in one of a very few countries, and Japan is not one of them. Pretty useless to me, unfortunately.

Also, that social fabric is going to collapse first in the densely populated areas.That's not where I have land and it's not where I would recommend investing.

Well, that's very debatable, the bit about having bigger problems to deal with. I agree that property rights are subjective. Regardless, it's still the best, most secure investment I've made.

You've been lucky. The trend is moving in the other direction.

Well, I'd argue that for the average, middle-class person, such investments have only been an option for the past few decades. I mean maybe you could go back to the early 20th century, but then after the big crash, it wasn't really an option until, what, the 50's? 60's? But it didn't really get rolling for middle-class people until the 80's. And you only have to look back to the crash of the 70's, 90's, and the two crashes in the 2000's to see how standard investments didn't work out so well for those who couldn't wait for the market to rebound. Sure, some funds weathered those crashes OK, but many did not. 
Put it this way, could a plumber or school teacher really buy stock or index funds easily 100 years ago? I think not. They didn't even have a mechanism for doing so, an easily accessible one.

Good advice in principle, but what happens when that retirement fund goes south? (This is assuming it's investments and not cash or equivalent like CD). 
The only investment I'm NOT concerned about is land. Crypto, stocks, IRAs... it could all turn to shit. But at least I can go to my land and eat grubs. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:53:55
Yeah, except rarely now do companies match 401K contributions, making them basically worthless. Vanguard has just as many crap funds as they do good performing ones. These old, worn out formulas just do not work any longer. Don't get me wrong, I do all this. It's just not anything to count on. IRAs give you very small benefits overall. A Roth IRA only pays if your investments do. It's just a way to defer tax on capital gains, but that only counts if you get capital gains. A traditional IRA is better for someone making high 5 figures or into 6, which most of us do not. It's all small potatoes int the end and a smoke and mirrors bullshit spiel from the investment community. Sorry young folks! You're pretty much screwed!

This is just an absurd statement. "...fundamentally the concepts have been pretty static since the beginning of civilization. " Right... and when exactly would you pinpoint the beginning of civilization? 20,000 years ago? Just curious.

I'm old enough to know that in the 70's, nobody owned stocks. Nobody in my neighborhood anyway. Now, everybody does. What do you mean by "humans"? Are these people you actually knew? You strike me as someone pulling textbook shit out of his or her ass. Clearly,  you're under 45 yo. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:41:33
LOL... I have to point something out here. I put a 'small portion' of my available funds into crypto, now my crypto is the largest portion of my portfolio, by far. Not even close. By small portion, I mean maybe 5%. 
Regarding taxes, my plan, not only for ctypto but for stocks too, is to cash out a yearly amount that won't result in a large tax hit. You only pay taxes on that income over a certain amount, right? And I think capital gains is treated as straight income, right? (I may be wrong there... not too worried about it.)
So when the time comes, I cash out a bit at a time. The approach is to have as little income as possible, whether via capital gains, salary, whatever. I'm older than most folks here though, so I have the luxury of not worrying too much about what happens 30 years from now, or even 25, or maybe even 20. There are advantages to getting older!
EDIT: Having said that, your advice is sound and I agree.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:50:10
Yeah but most funds do not, and even those that have a good track record can fail miserably when you are counting on them. Traditional methods of investing for us common folk, and by that I mean those methods that have been around for all of a few decades, are failing and have been since the 80's. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:39:53
Yes, I am arguing that electronics shifted the dynamics of financial markets. "...trace back centuries, and have historically been extensively used by agrarian communities..." Are you serious? Farmers have been investing in stocks for centuries? What... did you watch that tulip movie or something? Where is your evidence? 
Previous to the ease to invest via the Internet, most folks, well, just didn't. Do you really think the average middle class person in 1972 actually knew a stock broker personally? How old are you anyway? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:54:52
Post 1700's, when do you really think the average person, that person making ends meet, the average Joe and Joanne, really started investing. Honestly. When would you say 40%+ of  middle income people had any stake AT ALL in the stock market or anything else outside of common interest.

It's going to 100k within 3 years. When the stock markets and property markets crash, crypto will take off, particularly BTC because that's where a lot of the fringe big money will go. EDIT: Oh, and when the fiat currencies crash along with it...
EDIT: Ok, maybe  80k, but really up there.

Which ultimately increases the value of those remaining. Be sure, as the value rises, fewer will be lost.

This is fascinating, thank you. "Is subsidized.." use of passive.. don't worry, I won't be a completely annoying noob by asking 'by whom'! I'll research. Thanks for getting me started. Ideally, the 'whom' would be bitcoin itself, but then it's the math I'm not getting. At 21 million bitcoins never to change, that subsidy is coming from somewhere, not out of thin air (like dollars). How much fun is this! A mystery! 
@_date: 2016-10-10 00:07:25
Also new info for me. Thank you very much!
@_date: 2016-10-09 11:27:40
Getting there... please define blockspace... not the size of the block.... or is it? Thank you! OH! Is it the space available to send blocks? The carrying capacity at any one moment? EDIT: Oh, so 'we' is those of us using bitcoin... the 0.0002 bt I'm bidding is to get in line for a block.... am I getting there? EDIT 2: So.... if I'm right, this raises my original question. If, for example, bitcoin absolutely explodes in users and use... blocks will become more expensive, so transaction fees will go up. Long term, lets go crazy, N years down the road, supply (blocks) aren't meeting demand, transaction fees could potentially go sky high. Is that right? 
@_date: 2016-10-09 12:49:32
This is very informative. Thanks letscee and mistaik. The more I learn about bitcoin, the more fascinated I am, and this aspect of block space supply and demand seems to be the most dynamic. It will be affected by technological innovation (more efficiency) but also increased demand (more pressure). But at the end of the day, it's this gatekeeper aspect that seems to be the biggest... how shall I say... issue. There is a middleman after all, in essence. Is there anything on the horizon that will address this? 
@_date: 2016-10-10 00:08:56
Just want to say thanks to all of you for your help! I feel like my basic understanding has gone from 0 to enough that I can now move forward with educating myself on all this. Cheers!
@_date: 2016-10-08 02:39:31
Got it! So I can put Electrum on any machine, add seed, the bitcoin is synced/existing in the blockchain and I'm just accessing it. Right? (Angels singing, bells ringing, synapses shaking hands.) So how to sync is a non-question. Thank you!
@_date: 2016-10-10 00:03:28
Thank you! I should have RTFM! I thought the 21 million had already been created, but after reading your answer, I did RTFM and found "The number of new bitcoins created each year is automatically halved over time until bitcoin issuance halts completely with a total of 21 million bitcoins in existence. At this point, Bitcoin miners will probably be supported exclusively by numerous small transaction fees." Very interesting. So technical innovation is essential after all bitcoin are minted. 
@_date: 2016-10-09 11:40:47
It was my response that caused the confusion. Sorry. Your answer cleared it all up for me. Blockspace is just that, space on a block. Our fee is a 'bid' of sorts to get on a block ASAP. But what I will read up on is the supply/demand side of blockspace and how that affects fees. Doesn't seem to be much of an issue now, but how about the future? Thank you!
@_date: 2016-10-10 00:07:07
This is great. Thank you! Lots to learn.
@_date: 2016-10-08 09:16:03
OK, this is great... I'm getting it now I think. Thanks very much! Multiple wallets, multiple keys, offline... I can see how a safety deposit box might work into the equation if one had a lot invested in Bitcoin. But with my 1/4 of a Bitcoin, I'm not there yet! Thanks again. This is very helpful. Essential help, actually, so cheers. 
@_date: 2016-10-08 09:02:39
I really appreciate this explanation. This is all making so much sense now. What a brilliant system. It's redundant, open, yet secure. The private keys are just that, the keys, but I only need to remember/backup the seed. This is so cool I'm just going to jump up and down (in my head). Thanks again!

Well, I'm not going to buy any until it crashes again. I was wondering about coinmama because a friend couldn't figure out how to send btc out from his coinmama wallet. 
But I'll wait till it goes back down under 900 or so to buy any more.
