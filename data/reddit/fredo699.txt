But, even still, if the return rates on mining go down to negligible amounts, you're still going to have people hanging up their rigs because they're just not making a profit anymore.

True, but still... strange to think, if it does become that valuable, you spent so much for cat litter. I suppose it could happen with USD, too, but I find that unlikely.

Fuck it Friday. Throw in the towel Thursday.

I think I just felt something pass over my head. There was this great *woosh*ing sound.

I... don't like them either.

This seems very biased. For instance, it showed how Bitcoin broke $200, but not how it fell back down to ~$50 a few days later. I'm a supporter of Bitcoin, and I think it could change how we use currency, but I don't think it's right to just be conscious of the good things that happened to Bitcoin. That leads to delusion.

Honestly, I think everyone should use Bitcoin-Qt. Yeah, it's a pain in the ass to have to store the blockchain, but it's really the safest way.

You'll regret that when .0113 BTC pays for your retirement.

He said 'I hope', didn't he? I hope it replaces regular fiat too. That doesn't mean it will.

Here's what I'm *particularly* worried about.
The original projection for how long it would take to mine out all the bitcoin was over a century. Well, here we are five years after its conception, and we're ~50% of the way there. The mining boxes out there are performing necessary tasks for network, such as validation. The original paper does have a contingency plan for when the supply runs out: the miners will be rewarded by the miniscule transaction fee for Bitcoin. Theoretically, if Bitcoin was big enough, this might be enough to make running a node profitable. But, I don't think it'll be big enough in a few years, when we run out of BTC to mine. I think all of the nodes will shut down because it just won't be profitable enough.

Come on, guys, 8th grade logic. It checks out.

So? I write $ with two lines through.
@_date: 2013-10-11 07:13:10
Right, I hadn't considered that...
But, still. They have to keep a cut of it, don't they? And that just seems wrong to me.
@_date: 2013-10-11 06:18:51
I don't like the idea of gyft. Think about where the bitcoin is actually going. It's not going to Amazon; Amazon is just getting some fiat, while *all that bitcoin* is going to Gyft. I wonder how much they're accumulating.
@_date: 2013-11-03 03:57:59
Perhaps he's broke.
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:45:12
You can hardly call that making bitcoin. At that rate, you'd have to be working for *117 years* to make *one* bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-27 06:14:27
Exactly. This is going to be like trying to impose a tax on usage of the Internet. It's too hard to regulate, too hard to keep track of. They're never going to be able to do it properly.
That said, it sucks that they want to, at any rate.
@_date: 2014-04-27 12:14:13
I don't mean to sound like a dick, but why are you here if you're not a bitcoin enthusiast?
Anyway, it's not the actual act we're excited about. We're excited about the prospect of leveraging the community to get the word about Bitcoin out there.
@_date: 2014-01-14 19:36:29
What I should have said was, while I admit, the act *is* fraud, at least by our definition. But, outside of this community, I'm not sure if someone would actually be prosecuted for such an act.
@_date: 2014-05-01 01:16:26
Also, wouldn't that college student have had to been like 12 when he started mining?
@_date: 2014-04-12 20:40:05
Apart from Lojban, I don't know of any "real" language that has completely unambiguous pronunciation.
@_date: 2014-02-22 11:45:45
What do you mean? Right now, electronic payment *is* PayPal. One of the reasons a lot of people are excited for BitCoin is because it stands to change that unfortunate situation.
@_date: 2014-01-17 18:40:43
I'm not sure if it improves BitCoin's image to be defended so vehemently on WhollyHemp.com.
@_date: 2014-03-26 20:25:07
Sure, but was the question, "Do you understand Bitcoin?", to which I wouldn't be surprised that 48% of people said "yes."
Ultimately, if they can't tell me, specifically, how to use it, instead of just some sort of nebulous and poorly-informed concept ("Oh, it's like electronic money, or some shit."), they don't really understand it.
@_date: 2014-04-27 09:20:43
It's not a federal offense to "deface" currency. It's an offense to "destroy" currency. They're very different.
The reason we have that law is so that we have a stable mathematical model to calculate how many bills there are in America at any given time, so that the mint knows how much to print. The reason they need that is so that we can accurately maintain the value of the U.S. dollar, even if we haven't been doing a good job of that recently...
Now, value is pegged to abundance. So, if we have so many bills lying around we use them as a substitute for toilet paper, it's not worth very much. If we have so many we choose to keep our pennies in a safe, it's worth quite a bit.
The point I'm trying to get to is, "Defacing" a U.S. dollar still leaves it recognizable as a U.S. dollar. If you walked into a store and handed that to a cashier, they would take it.Therefore, it's not depleting the supply of money, therefore not destruction of currency.
edit: wording
@_date: 2014-04-27 11:26:48


You realize that cashiers aren't slaves, right? They *do* get paid. And if they do their job improperly, they *won't* get paid, for quite a while, probably.
@_date: 2014-04-27 13:53:08
Yeah, they give you like... 10 satoshis an hour.

They won't, but they won't know if you commit some other fraud on your taxes, convincingly. That is, until they get suspicious of you, and decide to conduct an audit...

The only problem is, that sticky is 10 years old now.
@_date: 2014-05-01 05:45:32
That's just not normal. I guess it could happen...
@_date: 2014-01-14 17:25:19
You can't commit fraud with something that isn't legally money. Fuck, anything's a store of value, so if you tell someone you have a certain amount of grain, when you really have another amount, is that fraud? No. It's a lie.

Obviously what he meant to say was "One nickel in 1913 is equivelant to $1 today."

I like how this is the first thing they have to say.
Nevermind that it's 900% up from its low last year.
