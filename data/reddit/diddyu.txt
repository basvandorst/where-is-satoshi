Until you see BTC as real money.

BTC rising "despite" altcoins dropping. Lol, WSJ doesn't understand the markets.
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:27:19
That sounds exactly like the kind of shit they should be informing their readers about.
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:00:28
Do it, you were probably gonna spend that money on stupid shit anyway.
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:07:50
Wtf is paper news? Did they print the internet?

He didn't light it, but he tried to fight it.
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:49:10
So, a hard fork then? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:35:26
Do you take bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:12:42
Cool, then I can get some of that sweet sweet bailout money when I fuck up my trades.
@_date: 2017-09-22 12:12:44
I'll buy all pre-orders at 50%.
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:51:36
Moon? 
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:04:06
I'm not talking about this.
@_date: 2017-09-25 03:55:46
Sure you can, it just takes a little more keyboard-fu. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 03:33:04
It's the chain. Calling it the original implies that there's more than one bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:00:24
Just buy the fucking dip.
@_date: 2017-10-07 07:24:46

"FOMO – Fear of missing out. The feeling when you see a huge green dildo on a chart and you don’t own that coin, so you sell other shit to buy into it freaking out."

Wait, is that just this shirt, or does that apply to all shirts? If so, this changes everything.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:59:39
Oh honey.
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:56:07

This, but place buy orders at lower price points with your unspent usd. That way, if there's a quick dip overnight, you already have an order in place to take advantage of it. Whenever it's time to place your daily buy, just cancel an order to free the funds needed.
