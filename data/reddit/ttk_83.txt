Non-zero fees multiplied by trading volumes lead to taxable income for the Chinese exchanges. These income figures are  public and easy to calculate. If they report fake trading volume online without paying taxes on this income, what will the Chinese tax authorities say?

Not too long ago I heard a story about a man running a sawmill business  in Russia. This type of business had a very competitive market and was making near-zero on selling only lumber. However, the business owner was smart enough to sell also sawdust which was an inevitable by-product of any sawmill and the only thing which made his business profitable.
Seems to resemble your case to some extent.

For a human mind it's a lot easier and more natural to process 1-3 digit numbers. We tend to count our annual salaries in thousands, our height in centimeters (at least those who use the metric system), wealth of billionaires in billions. 
In Belarus, my native country, the local currency periodically experiences periods of extremely high inflation, unknown in the Western world. In 2015 the exchange rate between the Belarusian rouble and the US dollar was  around 20000:1. Half of the population were billionaires. I live abroad and when I visited my parents in Belarus, every exchange rate manipulation inside my brain annoyed me substantially, making me feel slow-thinking and stupid.
In 2016 the government  declared a so-called "denomination" (redenomination) with 4 zeros removed. The exchage rate became 2:1 and new banknotes were issued.  Now to convert prices  from the us dollars to the local currency is  an easy effortless task. By the way, it was the second redenomination,  in 2000 three zeros were removed.  
Given deflationary nature of Bitcoin, IMHO similiar things should happen if the price is confidently fluctuating above $1000 for a reasonable period of time. The millibitcoin (mBTC) term is fit for purpose, maybe a bit longer than it should be. 
But this change is purely cosmetic. mBTC has nothing to do with the worries of the Chinese regulators.  T Their worries are about a possible "Bitcoin bubble". According to the various estimations I've read, the Chinese  exchanges account for 70-95% of the total exchange volume. Suppose the price drops to $200-$500 per Bitcoin. How much money will the Chinese users of Bitcoin loose?  With the total market cap of 15 billion dollars, it will be several billion dollars. 
So many Chinese are crazy gamblers. We've already seen a similiar situation with the stock market crash in China. 
If these "lower" mBTC prices appease the regulators, IMHO it means that something is wrong with Bitcoin in China.

I agree, the bitcoin ownership distribution doesn't follow from the exhange volume distribution. And the Chinese exchanges have  artificially inflated trade volumes due to zero fees. Since the exchange fees are likely to return to normal levels,  I hope we will see soon the real trade volumes of the Chinese exchanges.
The current activity on the Chinese exchanges is one of the indicators of the bitcoin adoption in China.  If we look at the localbitcoins.com statistics, we see that  China with its weekly trade of 400k USD accounts for only 2% of 20 million USD worldwide. And the largest bitcoin mining pools are based in China.  You can't exchange a lot, mine a lot and own nothing.
Just an ediucated guess that the people of China own substantial amount of bitcoins. 
The Chinese users of Bitcoin ~~will~~ could loose several billion dollars in case of severe price fall.

Can you recommend Bitcoin-friendly banks in EU?


IMHO, they think: "The risks and troubles of having a client who exchanges cryptocurrencies far outweigh fees and commissions which this client will generate".


In my case it means hundreds of small incoming crypto-related transactions.  Not a really viable solution. Likely, the bank will suspect that I am a money launderer.


Now it is significant. Those test transactions were insignificant.

Maltese passport = 1M EUR investment. Or residency in Malta for 5-6 consecutive years, if you are an EU citizen.
You don't need a Maltese passport to become a tax resident in Malta. Just  spend there 186+ days within a calendar year, apply for ID card + tax number.
Income is not subjected to tax if it's not remitted to Malta and you are not domiciled in Malta (read: not Maltese).

What is interesting about the recent price movements is that the bitcoin price has become "sticky" since August 2018. The price is hovering near some level for weeks and even months and then moves abruptly to another level to "hover" again.
August -November 2018: hovering near 6400 
November - now: hovering near 4000.
Does anybody have an explanation for this phenomenon?
