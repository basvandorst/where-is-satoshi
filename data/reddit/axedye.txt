So far I have $90 in Bitcoin and $10 in LTC. The BTC has already risen to 99 and some change over a few days. I'm digging this investment also really cool to read about. I've convinced a few Lyft passengers to buy in on it after getting them to Google it. My family is too skeptical, I've made some bad choices in the past so I get it lol. This shit is golden though just don't let a dip scare you, when and if it dips that's just cheaper Bitcoin for you in that moment.

I just invest blindly, all I know if I got less of a coin than the last time I bought but that shit will still rise lol problem is most people don't understand how it works or what it is and that bothers them it's no different than a man trading land for a couple horses and some whiskey. The understanding of its value will come way later and people will do the same exact thing to whatever comes next, ehhhh I don't know about this lol

It takes time but whether someone bought it at 19k or 10k recently they're still going to make money if they are patient.
