Oh I’m sure most of us know why bitcoin was invented. The question is now is. Is bitcoin and investment or a source of payment. If the price of bitcoin keeps going up like we all want and wish. I can’t see anyone using it to buy anything. That would be financial disaster.

Actually I’ve heard of big holders who do cash in to live and off the profits. But to pay the phone bill, or light bill or the super market? I can’t see it if bitcoin goes to the moon

Really? Lol

That’s how I’m seeing. It as well. Mostly all the answers here are read directly from the internet. I’d like a real opinion from a tea person with valid thoughts.

To me it seems like the places who accept bitcoin are laughing at the people who buy stuff from them.

I own an hvac business. We offer bitcoin payments. No one has used bitcoin to pay yet. But when they do my bitcoin is going with my others untouched for a long time.

Ok. I asked a question. Was hoping you can have a valid answer.
@_date: 2019-12-02 02:26:37
How will that do with bitcoin going to the moon! Everyone has the same answers. We know your answer. It’s yet not an answer. It what we all read on a daily basis. Give me an answer that is sensible. Instead of one thing from the internet

Basically I’m asking more than telling. I need to know what makes bitcoin a good investment. I can’t see it being a good investment and a good currency.  If anyone can help me understand it can be both
