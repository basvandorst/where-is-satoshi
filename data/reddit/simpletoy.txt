Yes. Telephone. Sorry about bad English. Remember, they were presenting to be the customer service. What I gave away was only my name. Then they instructed me to try to log in as I used to.

I did not give it to them. I used it in trying to log in. Like always the case over the past two years. After I put in the 2 factor authenticator code, the coinbase put up a page saying I am using the new device and there was no where to move forward. I am guessing they stepped in at this point and got into my account. But how?

Before or after?
Before this, I could not talk to any person. The email was a forever loop. When I call them, it let you select 1 if you think your account is comprised and otherwise stay online. Then they automatically hanged off after 1 minute wait
After this, I had the legitimate reason to press 1, and still waited 1 hour to get through. When I told them the account was hacked. They checked my balanced and simply asked if I want to close the account. This was literately the first thing they asked. Later, they took note of my story and again nothing happened.

I just do not know what happened. If I have any other information that I do not used to have, I could have logged in myself.

Thank you for your input. I can not say for something that I am not 100% sure. Probably they did it implicitly. My main question is how are they able to log in?

I used the text message as the 2FA. The thing is I could not log in. I have tried it from time to time over the last two years.

It was removed by reddit.

I have no idea. My experience with coinbase was always a loop of message. When I put in everything, coinbase show up a page telling me I was using a new device and need to verify it through email. I verified by clicking the link in the email and nothing happens. The hackers were able to step in when I saw the page about the new device and somehow managed to get into the system. I would appreciate it if anyone could tell me how the hackers did it.
