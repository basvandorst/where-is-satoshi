How do you buy directly from an exchange?

I understand but to advertise "no fees" and then to charge an exchange rate over $6 higher coindesk.com(which they link to on their website) and $8 higher than the rate Coinbase uses is pretty shady. If they are going to charge fees just be up front about them

Thanks for posting that. I didn't notice this

I totally understand what you are saying but the thing that bothers me the most is that on Circle's FAQ page they have a section "How much is a bitcoin worth 
On that page they link to coindesk.com which shows the current exchange rate. The rate I received was about 1.5% higher than the current rate on the coindesk at the time of the transaction. I was led to believe that was rate they were using. For me it's more the principle than the actual amount of money. If they said on their site we use the coindesk price and we add a 1.5% fee I would have no problem with it

I hope you're right and it evens out when I sell the Bitcoin. We'll see. I agree though it was an instant transaction and I agree that has value I just did't think Circle was as up front as they should be but maybe my expectations are unrealistic
