What are they doing with the customer USD deposits? I think it would be wrong if they are using these funds to buy bitcoins when their intention is to pay it back to the customers. This is a type of speculation because if they somehow get back the stolen bitcoins and btc drops in value they could't refund the losses.

A sell is a buy. You can't sell without someone else buying. There is no selling pressure simply from volume. You can buy 1btc and sell it again. This won't increase buying or selling pressure even if you do it 1000 times because it just equals out. The thing is the block reward doesn't equal out.

21 million is based on halvings every 4 years (measured in 10 minute blocks). If it was suppossed to be 20 million in the end SN would have had to choose other odd numbers like 3.914 years halvings or an initial block reward of 49.357 instead of 50. Or instead of the halving we would have a 0.4632 decrease. You see, even amounts are nicer.
(the odd amounts are just guessed examples)

Bitcoin is always mentioned as a very high risk thing where you can loose everything. Most people are just very risk averted. Look at how they argue against traditional investment like eg stocks. "You'll probably lose everything." This is at least my experience.
Also to purchase stocks (pr bonds etc) you can use the known bank where you are already registered at and invest in a well known company. A simple comparison: Buy Exxon Mobil stocks with your old Wells Fargo account or buy bitcoin with your bitfinex account. For many people bitcoin is just too much new stuff.

I also don't fully trust those dedicated hardware wallets. I prefer an old encrypted netbook without network connectivity. Wallets like Electrum and Armory support to sign transactions offline. You create the transaction on your online pc which doesn't have the private keys and store it on flash drive. Then you sign the tx on your offline pc where you can double check the amounts and addresses. Hardware wallets are easier to use though.

It is much easier to understand how bitcoin works when you just try to use it (wallets, transactions, blockchain explorer).

Altcoin markets are crazy. A few of these currencies might survive but there isn't room for hundreds of them. Altcoin trading is mostly gambling because how else can an altcoin like InsaneCoin with no advantage in anything get to a valuation of more than 1 million USD? These coins are not bought as an investment or as a store of value, it's just a short term gamble.   
I am not saying that bitcoins are not bought as a pure gamble but with altcoins the percentage must be a lot higher.
@_date: 2019-04-28 22:33:04
This problem in 2017 was caused by bad fee estimation algorithms. Many wallets overpaid the needed fee. Before the fees were high and blocks were full this worked fine. You would get a good user experience: fast transactions at a low price.
When blocks were constantly full this became a disaster because these wallets tried to outbid each other without a limit.

You can run your bitcoin node on your desktop and connect to testnet. Testnet has a much smaller blockchain.
Even a raspberry pi can run a btc node but I wouldn't recommend it for development.

'Buy high, sell low.' is a bad advise.
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:12:10
It would help if older inputs had an higher priority to get into the next block. It used to be like that.
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:36:39


Some people think it is and then they turn their brain off.

Did you receive a notification when it got shipped?

Also big mining farms with subsidized electricity will always be much more profitable than home run mining rigs. The POW algorithm can’t change that.
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:04:47
Wait for the next release.
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:44:26
Good practice but the best practice would have an air gap.
@_date: 2016-09-15 23:50:25
Many things are so much easier with bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:08:31
This is why I printed out a list of receive and change addresses. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:47:55
Lol @ the shady guy counting his fiat money.
I am perfectly comfortable with the thought that someone is counting the fiat money that I used to buy bitcoin in the last years.
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:15:45
Yeah, let's replace Bitmain with a more powerful company such as Nvidia or Intel.
@_date: 2018-07-03 22:26:08
The cost factors of mining are mainly electricity and hardware. If the hardware is more expensive you have less money to pay for electricity. Or the other way around, if you spend less on energy you can spend more on hardware.

Hardware production isn't even more eco-friendly. It just shifts where the work is done.

m is milli and not micro
@_date: 2015-04-11 22:24:15
I am getting angry by just reading this. These people are horrible. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 06:43:33
And what happens to the 97% of your paycheck?
@_date: 2015-09-23 20:54:01
I did not expect such a detailed answer to my question. It just sounded as if you only get 3% of your salary but your financials seem to be well structured.
@_date: 2018-04-28 19:12:11
You can use Electrum with the Trezor (and also with the Ledger Nano S). You can see all your balances and public keys. The hardware wallet only needs to be connected when you want to sign a transaction.
@_date: 2018-04-28 18:02:59
If you run it offline you can't view your balance or broadcast a transaction.
@_date: 2015-04-19 13:45:07
Telling how much bitcoin you own is more like telling how much gold you own or how many stocks of a company you own. Also this subreddit is about bitcoin, in other subreddits about other currencies  you would also more likely tell how much you own.
@_date: 2016-10-29 18:37:59
If it is still below 10k in 10 years bitcoin has failed.

Hillary is too "socialistic".
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:48:17
I didn't find that information, that's why I asked.
@_date: 2016-10-29 05:47:12
It is just undervalued this year and last year because much money went into altcoins but now we are in an uptrend.
@_date: 2017-05-15 10:28:10


Is that something that would be implemented in wallets and can be done without third party risk?
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:50:01
Same as μBTC (if you don't call it 'bits').
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:19:12
When I wake up at night I check the time and then bitcoin and I haven't even thought about selling in the last 4 years.
@_date: 2017-05-18 09:33:30
What happens when bitcoin doesn't change at all?
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:18:15
μm, μV, μs .... μBTC  
It's not like there's a whole different logic applied.
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:24:15
Yeah, while short term price movements are interesting they are not as relevant as the overall trend.
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:20:42


Can you give a number?
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:57:12
Asics are not the problem. The mining business would just need more competition.
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:50:49
You pay taxes to keep that money burning machine happy. And of course a small fraction is used for useful stuff like roads.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:29:31
Absolutely possible, and we could also be much higher by then. 4k is less than a doubling away. Of course we could also go in the other direction...
@_date: 2015-11-21 20:10:17


In this case you could never hide anything on these computers.
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:15:29
Yeah, we just need an improvement now.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:21:40
It is always the same, no need to watch it again.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:52:46
@_date: 2015-11-01 13:54:58
This will come more into effect when the next halving has happened.

Thanks for compiling this data, this is really interesting.

investing vs consuming
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:44:07
Bitcoin is officially dead, finally.
@_date: 2017-05-18 07:54:49
A compromise is better than having a deadlock situation forever.
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:58:17
I feel similar, I have never sold a coin in years and I am scared if I sell a few that I will never be able to buy them all back again. We could see a double-bubble this year like in 2013 which could make the coins really expensive.
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:09:34
Unless you are in the US most people know about the metric system.
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:56:37


We had many good news in the last years, you are thinking short-term.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:09:21
Just listen to the experts. They are always right.
@_date: 2017-05-09 11:13:50
This is either best or worst financial decision of your life.
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:32:46
Yeah, short-term investing is gambling. My stack had lost 80% of it's value but I kept averaging down and I had been patient. Now it already doubled multiple times.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:06:37
They only mined 0.1% of the blocks last week but every bit counts.
@_date: 2017-05-25 06:29:23
Sell a fraktion and continue your ride with the remaining amount.
@_date: 2017-05-25 06:25:52
You have to import that privatekey into a software wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:09:14
Just be aware that private banking can be very expensive. This is for people who struggle at making their own investment decisions and don't want just index funds.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:00:54
Or Amazon/Google would do it with spare resources. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:56:19
Fuck private banks, I didn't choose bitcoin to migrate my wealth to one of those 'exclusive' rip-off schemes.
@_date: 2017-05-12 00:54:45
I installed breadwallet and other wallets when Apple started to accept bitcoin wallets. I can approve this but I still feel pretty safe because of backups and pin codes.
@_date: 2015-11-28 17:56:41
What is making you sure in the thought that future processors will be still made of silicon?
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:18:04
International fiat transactions are expensive and slow (dead on weekends), also the KYC shit is making things complicated.
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:56:58
Or we are in a bear trap but who could tell for sure?
@_date: 2017-07-02 06:37:27
That would require a good internet connection to run them all at the same time.
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:20:07
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:20:59
Bitcoin is even listed as the first payment option.
@_date: 2015-03-07 22:56:53
The instructions on their website don't mention any verification but it is limmited to USD--&gt;BTC and a maximum of 2500$ at once.
@_date: 2017-05-09 11:13:13
This is either best or worst financial decision of your life.

Smartphone cold storage solution with transaction signing via QR code.
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:14:56
And you want to teach that a bit in bitcoin is not the smallest amount unlike everywhere else?
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:48:30
Thanks, looks like it scales pretty badly or did I miss how it got more adoption?
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:03:47
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:00:07
It also feels good to say nothing. From time to time I hear bad comments about bitcoin and then I'm just thinking my things.
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:12:48
What kind of solution do you mean?
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:14:57
SegWit itself is still at least two weeks away.
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:29:19
They are also doing a cooperation with kraken.
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:00:30
I think there are a lot of guys who are realizing a loss now because they thought they could get rich quick and by quick I mean in a few days. Short term price movements are made by short term gamblers, they are the ones producing the big trade volumes.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:13:07
Who is even watching that gif?
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:52:48
There are other exchanges.
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:41:32
I tried the telegram bot but it didn't work for me. I typed in '3' and the price increased almost 10% since then but I didn't receive any notification.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:28:57
I don't think so.
@_date: 2017-05-14 08:07:42
Yeah, it feels good to be right especially when a lot of money is involved. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 15:01:56
Where are the numbers from the title???
@_date: 2016-07-14 23:07:50
But why do they double the coins if they could just double the value?
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:15:53
Experts will confirm it, there won't be any doubts left.
@_date: 2015-03-10 13:56:38
You are speaking about goxcoins and not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-21 00:46:23
I would prefer uBTC ( micro BTC ) but bits is also better than 0.00XX BTC for a small purchase.
@_date: 2015-02-03 20:11:02
Not a real charity but a great open source project which accepts bitcoin for donations: megapirateng.com
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:10:33
But nobody would recognize that.
@_date: 2019-05-11 14:39:58
After changing something in a signed transaction it is not valid anymore.
@_date: 2015-02-24 17:41:37
If you can send your bitcoins from counbase to your own address you can do what you want. Otherwise if you can't even send btc to your own address it would not be bitcoin but another payment system.
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:13:55
The thing is we don't know where the destination is and how long it will take. This is what makes the thrill. It doesn't feel like we are on a fixed railway route.
@_date: 2017-06-03 12:37:46
I heard they already had full blocks and a backlog a few days ago and their blockchain is bigger than the bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2015-02-01 23:00:18
This is great. Someday the state could pay streets with bitcoin. Sorry, just dreaming...
@_date: 2016-07-12 13:57:03
tldr to the moon!
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:47:48
breadwallet my favourite mobile wallet. I really like it because of the SPV concept, the the determinstic addresses and the recovery seed. The only thing I am missing is the management of the used addresses. It would be nice if you could choose to spend bitcoins from a specific address or to temporary lock an address from use.
@_date: 2016-07-29 23:16:50
My question wasn't about the law. No one thinks about capital gains when paying for a coffee in a foreign currency, wether it is paid in bitcoin, in CAD or in EUR. 
@_date: 2016-07-15 18:52:00
It is like a placebo.
@_date: 2018-12-19 00:40:36
When you highlight that it's non custodial then you shouldn't make such restrictions. Bitcoin itself doesn't know borders.
@_date: 2018-12-24 12:27:41
The site says 98 for me.
@_date: 2018-12-15 22:10:08
The "priced in" argument has been the typical response to anyone who was anticipating the last halving. 
@_date: 2016-07-29 17:14:16
Would you pay the the capital gains tax on a coffee paid in CAD?
@_date: 2018-12-21 13:33:31
Because the value of the raw material is only a fraction of what you pay for a bracelet.
@_date: 2019-05-24 22:58:36
Looks like they are operating Bitcoin ATMs.

This is great, segwit is getting real.
@_date: 2018-12-31 00:00:58
Bitcoin is money.
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:44:44
Better they complain about banks than about their stupid backup failures.
@_date: 2017-06-06 01:34:19
price goes up: waiting for the dip  
price goes down: bitcoin is dead
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:17:56
It was always uncertain but now we will soon have a scaling solution which will include segwit. It is only uncertain in which way segwit will get activated
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:22:45
In the future many analysts will publish their reports about bitcoin. I hope they won't have much influence about the price.
@_date: 2018-12-19 01:10:39
How would we get forward if every would just buy more bitcoin?
This startup is not just another blockchain-for-something company.
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:02:05
They offer worldwide free shipping:  
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:31:31
That buyer doesn't need to buy a new one directly from Bitmain.
@_date: 2017-06-02 06:51:47
I remember when I used to send zero fee transactions and I had a bad conscience about it because that wouldn't support the miners. It's not that long ago.

Faketoshis Fork is the real BCash.
@_date: 2017-06-24 17:32:04


Wouldn't this be rejected by the nodes?
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:50:49
Given you control the keys then the implementation of how your transactions are getting signed doesn't say anything about your privacy. It's only a security concern.
@_date: 2018-12-08 11:52:28
Hodling is a rather safe strategy but for sure, if you were able to reliably predict the market then you could yield much better results. If you think you can do this then just tell us were the bitcoin price will be in 1, 2 and 3 month. See?
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:03:56
Try a light wallet like Electrum.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:25:00
All I hear is 'bitflyer'.
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:54:21
It allows more throughput but it is actually less efficient than bitcoin. Also just increasing the limits is not a long term solution, that's why we need a second layer.
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:42:14
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:25:17
All I hear is 'bitflyer'.

That might be true for most of us but think of the average nocoiner.

is now blacklisted? I actually liked this bot.
@_date: 2017-06-08 11:23:23
Also verify the written seed by initializing a new wallet from it.
@_date: 2018-12-21 01:55:20
That was in a bull market. It's easy to buy something when it's going up all the time.
Now we have a different situation.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:25:52
Who are the others? Unless you are asking a bitcoiner about it you'll still hear very skeptical comments like 'it's a bubble/ponzi/scam'.
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:39:42
Who cares? If you don't like this shit then don't participate.
@_date: 2017-06-05 07:45:43
I don't understand how this scam works. What happens when you type in 51?

This is nice. I'd love to see this graphic for a longer time frame, where you can see the bubble cycles.
