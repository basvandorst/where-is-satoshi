They shouldn't, the price going down fast now is the best thing that can happen. People buying bitcoin on margin with money they don't own attracts the attention of people who can trigger cascading margin calls - see bifinex flash crash and yesterday's btc-e crash.

Most wallets set a default fee of around 0.0005 btc I believe but fees actually depend on the size (KB of your transaction). See [Bitcoinfees.com]( for a beautifully illustrated explanation of fees.

If you want to learn about reading the market see You will realize that it is actually very difficult to call the bottom of a downtrend, but many are saying $350 might be it.

Ok I'll play your game and reply in the manner you are hoping for.
1. True
2. True
3. First occurrence of the words "scalability paradox" applied to bitcoin. It isn't clear what you mean by "If bitcoin scales" in those bullet points. Please define.
4. I don't buy it. The first sentence is true. We've seen this continuously, the network hash rate goes up and down as mining becomes profitable/non-profitable for various miners. Second sentence is a slippery-slope fallacy which hinges on your point  which really isn't making sense (to me at least) at the moment.
5. again... hinging on badly formed previous arguments so useless to approach at the moment.
I'm not trying to sound condescending and am genuinely interested in the conversation if you are willing to approach point by point.
