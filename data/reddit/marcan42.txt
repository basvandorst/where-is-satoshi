I'm not arguing for or against the likelihood of him being Satoshi. All I'm saying is a cryptographic fact: if he brings cryptographic proof, then that only means he has access to the keys.
You can argue that that makes it very likely that he is Satoshi if you want. But in information security, there are facts, and then there are likelihoods. That's not a fact. That doesn't mean you shouldn't treat it as a reasonable conclusion, but if you make the hard statement that he is Satoshi without considering alternative valid explanations, you do not have an informed opinion.

Correct. I just demonstrated how it's done. Anyone could do it for any transaction in the blockchain. The only deceptive bit is that he claimed some random textfile (which he doesn't show in its entirety) has the SHA256 hash that, in fact, is the SHA256 hash of the data blob that I explained how to construct from blockchain data. So there's one "small" lie and the rest is trivial.

Depends on which private key. There's more than one. He could have access to a key used early on (as proof) but which is no longer holding any significant amount of bitcoin.

Click the link for the transaction, look at the "Inputs" section, "Script" column.
@_date: 2016-05-02 16:35:56
Well, I did, that's what the selfpost is about. You could do that with any other transaction on the blockchain (adjusting offsets) and produce a message and sig combination that validate using a public key in the blockchain, for any address that has ever spent coins.
Yes, if the message to be signed contained text to that effect, it would imply he has access to the key. More accurately, it would imply someone with access to the key signed that message.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:27:35
Not necessarily. There are stronger proofs available. For example, if he had inserted a message in the blockchain early on (or, indeed, in the genesis block), or a hash thereof, that linked him to his real name (not via a layer of public-key crypto), that would prove that link at that point in time, and is not something you could forge if you stole any information he had after that point. This is something he would've had to plan in advance, of course.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:29:38
That is a fair point, but he could still provide proof by demonstrating possession of, say, multiple keys, not just one. He could also have planned ahead and have the ability to provide a stronger proof, such as by linking his real name to data snuck into the blockchain early on (e.g. using hash(name || secret) somewhere, and publishing secret as proof).

The not-so-generic verify-tutorial contains a blatant lie: that that (incomplete) Sartre text hashes to the stated SHA-256 hash. It does not, because what *actually* hashes to that SHA-256 hash is the transaction verification data for an existing blockchain transaction, which has nothing to do with Sartre. That is demonstrably a lie, not a puzzle.
@_date: 2016-05-02 15:19:46
Careful. If he signed an arbitrary message as Gavin claims, then the only thing that proves is he has Satoshi's private key or access to use it. It's not inconceivable that he somehow legitimately or illegitimately gained access to that private key without actually being the person himself.
Ultimately, technology can't answer social questions like "is person X person Y".

Whoops, missed that bit. Yeah, his `Sartre` is my `sig_txn.bin`. Which means he either found a SHA256 collision or he's lying. I'm going to go with lying.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:36:42
Yeah, I somehow missed that bit the first time around. Edited the post to note that.
@_date: 2016-05-03 02:48:37
No it's not. There are ~100m transactions in the blockchain. That means that, for a crappy hash like MD5, it's equivalent to a 2^101 difficulty preimage attack (collision attacks require malleability of both colliding plaintexts). Not even remotely feasible, nevermind with SHA-256.

To prove ownership of a key (i.e. a Bitcoin wallet), you need to sign something with that key. That something has to be something that proves your identity. The media forgot to check that - Craig just pulled out the data that Satoshi signed as part of a Bitcoin transaction in the past, and claimed that he signed it, and demonstrated the verification of the signature (which works).
Cryptography is only half the puzzle. What wasn't checked here is whether the message signed actually demonstrated anything. A good message would've been a quote from the news today, plus a statement saying "Satoshi is Craig" or similar. Instead, the message here was something that Satoshi did indeed sign, in the past, as part of a regular Bitcoin transaction - Craig just pulled the necessary data out of the blockchain and claimed it as his own.
It's as if I obtained (or made a copy of) some document that you signed, and claimed that I am you, because I have a document with your signature on it. Yes, it's your signature, but nobody saw me sign it, and the document doesn't say anything about me being you.
