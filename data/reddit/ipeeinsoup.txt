I really don't know. I'm hopeful that as the technology progresses, reasons will start to appear.

I can't emphasize this enough. Users are lazy, and if you want this to become more than a niche product, it is extremely important that it is as easy as possible to use.

Honestly, I think the bigger issue is that there's no incentive for the average user to use it. I own some btc from way back when, and I'd love to use it, or buy more, but for any online purchase I can use a credit card, get 1 month of float, 1-3% cashback, an extended warranty, and fraud protection.
With bitcoin, I get to deal with volatility, pay money for the transaction (albeit quite small right now), and pay money to buy the bitcoins.
tldr; I think a lot of people (me included) really don't have any reason to be using bitcoin - to really drive consumer adoption, you need significant incentives.

I think a dns system that lets users register names, and map them to bitcoin addresses would make a lot of sense.
This could hook into the dns system (using something like TXT records), or be an entirely different system. We could also define some sort of protocol (similar to what itunes does), so you can click on a username, and it opens your bitcoin client.

It would make sense for them to switch out of the pool. They have enough hashing value to hash on their own (without a pool), and they'd save on the 3% fee that the pool charges.

Honestly, it's good for Bitcoin in the long run. The BitForce Jalapeno is $150, which is in the same range as video card prices. The prices on these will go down by a significant amount over the next few years, and become accessible to more people.
If these companies didn't come out with ASICs, a person (or government) could easily throw several million dollars at developing their own ASICs, and overthrow the network. By developing ASICs, and selling them, the hashing power is more distributed.

Exactly. Redbox could have you deposit enough to cover your rental if you don't return it, and automatically refund to your bitcoin address when you return it.

I think the price on this is wrong:
(It's ~$50 on Newegg and Amazon).
