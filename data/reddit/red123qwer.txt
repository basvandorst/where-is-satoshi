i dont think is like that... nobody stay and generate 250 addresses  I'm sure is an app who do that
BUT  why he choose to split that? for anonymity ?..the fee is pretty big when u  split to 200-300 addresses

what do you mean by " transfer ownership" ??
what I find out from those 250+ addresses that person pay  3 persons ..hard to check it but..i did it... so one person  receive  like 250$ from 200 btc addressee (each address send him ~1.25$ of btc )     fee for that transaction was 15$ of btc
