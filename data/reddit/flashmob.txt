Just gave him some mBTC. Looking forward to Wikipedia accepting BTC donations.

Donated. Hopefully the fruits of this project will benefit the Bitcoin project, and also so many others that use openSSL

How about translate  to Ukranian? Seeing they have Japanese, German, French and Dutch, I'm sure it can be done.
Their HTML is on Github 
I can help with Git if there are any Ukrainain speakers here interested in doing a translation?
As for voicing the video, some Ukranian voice talents for hire here:

She makes all sorts of designs by request. Btw, I think coffee shops are a great use case for bitcoin as there's no fumbling for change and one can also implement a loyalty system that can't be cheated.

Used bitcoin to register  for my bitcoin node :)
Cheers to Namecheap!

The genesis block is unspendable,  
You probably meant Satoshi's PGP key, all he needs to do is sign a message with his private PGP key. Then we can be 100% sure (Assuming his private key wasn't compromised)
His public key is here:

Wow, that's my photo from 2014! Brings back memories: Some of the comments from when I shared were hilarious [

This was almost in the middle of nowhere in this little road-side hut: 
@_date: 2017-04-05 20:36:14
Exactly! I was just astonished as you. It's basically country side Japan.
@_date: 2017-04-05 20:45:10
I always keep a small amount of btc in my wallet to pay for small things here and there, and refill it after spending.
@_date: 2017-04-05 20:28:25
For travellers to Japan, it means your foreign bank card will not work in most places so you have to use cash. Too bad if you run out of cash.
In this case, I could do an electronic transaction and bypass useless banks entirety.
Interestingly, he said I was the first to pay with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 20:34:01
No confirmation. I did the transaction Infront of him, so he knows my face. Although I can confirm it tasted good.

yes, mtgox price updates every minute. Yes, there's lag so would be possible to do arbitrage. Not sure how to prevent that, but I'm assuming that it doesn't move much in a minute, and if it does, then it tends to quickly bounce back ....  Perhaps there could be a rule added which requires a minute before a trade can be closed?
@_date: 2011-06-17 02:25:17
What could happen is that it could show a profit on your page, then the rate can update, but the page doesn't update. Then when you close the trade, the system takes the latest rate, not the one displayed. Please contact support with more details so that this can be investigated.
EDIT: Bug was confirmed and a fix applied.

checking now

Hello sir, sorry for taking so long... I've applied some fixes now!
Let me know if that solves the problem. Thanks for reporting. 
I just placed $1,000,000.00 USD worth of Bitcoin on a short-sell order and will be watching it closely.

Which OpenID provider do you use? You could try logging in to google or yahoo first, then click on either icon to log in. Please be patient, as sometimes it can take a while.
Btw, the site doesn't take any of your person information from these providers, it just uses them for authentication!
No usernames or passwords are passed around or stored on CT.
@_date: 2011-06-16 22:42:07
Thanks, will work on fixing the charts a little more.
The chart is for daily. I do not have historical data for BTC, although I'm collecting it now. Perhaps someone can point me where I can download?
I hope to present all the currencies in their proper currency pairs in the future. 
@_date: 2011-06-16 22:19:01
Ok, I zapped Bill Gates to make the playing field level! Sorry, he was there just for testing things.
Looks like a lot of guys went long on the BTC and all the ranks plummeted with the fall in the BTC value last few hours. Note that you can also go short on BTC, which some of you have!
@_date: 2011-06-17 10:15:24
Thanks, good suggestion. Changed it now so that the welcome message is displayed once per session

I'm 'Mark Cuban' on there. Swear I wasn't cheating... 
Hmm, the ability to view another player's trading history may be good?
@_date: 2011-06-16 17:32:03
Thanks, have fun! 
I made the screen fit for a smart phone to you can practice trading wherever you go,
So tired, sleep need now...cheers

Hi all! Guerrilla Mail dev here! Thanks for checking it out.
This has been available for a while, however it seems like there's not much demand for such a service, it's not getting much use. 
It was created about 2 years ago, and now there's been many new developments such multisig and contracts which would probably make a much better version of this.
It will only send an email if an SSL connection can be established between SMTP servers - so the email doesn't travel in cleartext. Although there's no guarantee to what happens to email once it gets delivered - so **use only for small amounts**. 
Anyway, this will be getting retired soon due to the concerns above. So please try if you haven't done already, maybe send of a few tips to some email addresses and see if it works before it's finally retired in its current form.
@_date: 2015-03-14 22:02:36
Totally agree - not much time was spent on improving the UX as much as I should have
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:56:07
According to Satoshi's paper, if it gets the majority of hashpower, it should be called BTC. Until then, whatever name you give it  should be temporary. Not taking sides here, just an objective view &amp; according to Satoshi's vision.
@_date: 2015-03-14 22:02:35
Thanks! Glad to see it useful :) Currently, the dev 'team' is just myself.
@_date: 2013-09-27 21:52:05
The emails processed count is for the number of emails received. Guerrilla Mail is a temp mail system, where you get an email address for mostly receiving stuff. After half a decade in operation, the number of emails coming in only increases, most of this is spam.
I shall add a separate tally of all the XBT transferred.
@_date: 2013-10-20 02:11:48
yep, nothing new, but it's good to have alternatives.
Some differences:
1. Site *always* uses SSL. 
2. Emails are only sent when TLS/SSL can be used to secure the SMTP connection
@_date: 2013-11-14 09:08:26
You've got some excellent ideas. I have a feeling that we'll be coming back to this post in the future and note it as the one where it all started. 
Although to comment about "offering people money to get out of line in front of you when you're lining up to buy a last-minute present for an important date" - I would be unhappy if the person in-front of me let someone else in by paying. The entire tail end of the line would need to be paid for it to be fair. Same thing goes for cars, it would not be fair if the driver ahead let someone in, got paid, but I didn't. Also, there will be always people who try to exploit the system, eg, line up just to make money from people who need to jump the queue.
@_date: 2013-09-27 21:59:10
Thanks, it makes sense.

Try Woolloomooloo's Old Fitzroy in Sydney, accepts bitcoin I hear
@_date: 2013-09-27 13:03:48
Thanks. 
There's already a few of these services around. 
One difference is that this service probes the other SMTP servers to make sure that the email will get delivered using TLS.
It seems like bitcoin + email can work well in the future, there's potential to do some interesting things like spam prevention (using a bond system). 
@_date: 2013-11-13 11:55:04
This could be a great app!
When I merge lanes, I usually wave my hand to say thanks. It would be nice to tip them, say 5 satoshis.
I could just say "5 satoshis, thanks" while pointing at the at the bitcoin address sticker attached to their bumper.

I was at the bank the other week for a different thing...
While waiting for the teller to file some forms, I overheard the teller say "coinjar" to the right - I froze, looked up, and saw someone was making a direct deposit!
