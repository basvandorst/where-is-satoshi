it's deep man...

the real elephant in the room is that bitcoin is dying, please hear me out before downvoting into oblivion:
* yes, people said bitcoin was dying before due to mtgox but well the price never recovered and the perception was made terrible by it.
* bitpay is failing. paying a premium to convert your money to bitcoin to buy airline tickets or socks doesn't make any sense and should have been obvious. that said, they did a lot of good for the bitcoin brand and they will no longer be doing that anymore.
* circle (the once touted savior) is pretty much pivoting away from bitcoin. if this isn't a HUGE red flag i'm not really sure what is.
* changetip: see also pivot. this was going to spread awareness everywhere. now it's all USD...
* coinbase: everyone's favorite company to hate. and by "everyone" i mean DNM merchants/money launderers who fill this sub with nonsense because coinbase is supposed to just completely ignore the government. we haven't heard anything here yet but this is probably the next domino-- and if this one falls it will be the end of any possible chance normal people end up using bitcoin.
* still no plan on how bitcoin could scale to accommodate real volume anyway even if the above problems miraculously remedied themselves.
i like bitcoin but things don't look good. at least people will probably stop bothering the bitcoin wizards and let them tinker around with their toy in peace now.

when all of the businesses who could've possibly helped onboard a global userbase either go-under or pivot away from bitcoin that's what you'll be left with.

bitcoin used only by a small niche of a few hundred users just isn't very interesting and doesn't really end up accomplishing much. why does that scenario excite you?
@_date: 2015-09-27 18:36:25
you haven't really provided me with anything quantitative to discuss. my advice to you is to be extremely wary of using the daily tx rate as an indicator of anything significant.
@_date: 2015-09-26 20:41:05
i'm not really concerned about a threat that relies on bitcoin continuing to exist in the future let alone at scale.

i'm genuinely interested in what those positives are and what your metric for growth is.
@_date: 2015-09-26 22:24:37
if you only interact with the same very small set of people all the fancy crypto in the world won't hide you. you will be trivial to censor.
@_date: 2015-09-26 19:25:48
lol. the latest in a long line. perhaps the worst was assuming people would pay a premium to convert their money into bitcoin to purchase airline tickets and socks.
@_date: 2015-09-27 18:42:35
you claimed to see positives and that things were growing. the onus was then on you to substantiate that. i provided facts as far as i can tell with the exception of the speculation about coinbase but i made it obvious that was my opinion.

i think you mean $75m but in any case "falling" to me includes pivoting away from bitcoin-- which changetip already has.

there's a *big* difference between this space and the general start-up market. every participant in this space is depending on mass acceptance of a single brand new internet-based global currency. that's in addition to the merit of their own individual business' plan and their ability to successfully execute on the plan.

i sincerely have no idea why you keep fighting these "developers". i would've walked away a long time ago. you could be working with any number of reasonable and capable engineers solving any number of interesting problems.

yup. definitely shouldn't question the project. never question the project. it is too dangerous and bitcoin is too fragile for the project to be questioned. just follow along with your benevolent self-appointed thought-leaders. we've taken care of all the thinking for you.
