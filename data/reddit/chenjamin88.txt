What method are you trying to use? Visa debit, credit card, bank transfer?

Weird. I had issues with credit and bank transfer but debit worked immediately. 
The bank called me next working day then afterwards all 3 worked. 
This was before the last 2 weeks tho so all sides might have issues with the current volume.

Unless you know your government has said anything about banning buying cryptocurrencies then switch banks.

Agreed that if you look back in time it was more violent. And this is definitely true. I think its just a badly constructed example. 
I think the point they are trying to make is that prior to the repeal of the gold standard or any other form of currency backing, aggression could only be sustained for as long as you could finance it, so conflicts tended to be periods of simmering hatred with brief flashes of open war. The times where wars went on for a long time they might have the resources of say a colonial empire, or they simply let the troops pillage the occupied territory. But once the money was gone so were the troops. With the ability to print money at will the aggression while comparably may not be more violent that before, is much more sustained. If you think about it, the USA has constantly been at conflict for the last century. 
The one that always blows my mind is when the government issues more currency then buys securities like government bonds, just stop and think what happened there.
