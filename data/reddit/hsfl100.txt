Will it be possible to have exchanges for Fiat&lt;&gt;LN? First time I heard about that.

Why would they store that much on a hot wallet? seems unlikely. Unless we are witness to the first heist from cold storage of this caliber.

Nvm I can answer my own question after findin this wiki:
As of May 2016, the following sites seem to plot the required fee, in satoshi per (kilo)byte, required to get a transaction mined in a certain number of blocks. Note that all these algorithms work in terms of probabilities.

How did you implement the model? \(using what software or did you write it from scratch\)
Will you release the model or codebase? I would love to implement it myself and build on it, I want to test the extensions you suggest and I have some ideas of my own.

Do you think consumers are price\-sensitive to changes in hashrate? So far it doesn't seem like consumers would care about a change in 10 ex/sec up or down, but they might care about a ranking of all cryptocurrencies by hashrate.
