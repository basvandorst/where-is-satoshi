capital losses are deductible. why would you be taxed on capital gains, but nothing happens for losses?

Can you have the wallet on a physical hard drive, and have it Somewhere like google drive? That way it's backed up in more than one place.

I am giving her money that I already paid taxes on. Clearly not a crime.
I am helping her trade crypto and stocks. If that is a crime, then there are tons of people In trouble. 
I'm simply trying to see what you think here is a crime.

We'd be married in a year... We'd have a bank account in both of our names. And all profits would go through there.
Again I'm just giving her money, and she's withdrawing to bank in both our names. Only thing iffy is if I'm trading on her account, but I don't think that would be an issue - I don't think IRS puts people in jail if they log on their spouses crypto or stock account.

Lolol. Enjoy paying capital gains on your crypto and stocks btw

There are no taxes avoided when I send the money out, that is all legal. Again I don't see why it matters what happens to the money after that. If you give money to someone, why are you legally on the hook what happens to it after that. 
From that point on, I would help my girlfriend/wife do trading. I also don't see how that is a crime as plenty of people do that.
Not trying to sound like I want to commit crimes, I'm just trying to see the laws around it
Edit: when I send the btc, they will have the taxes paid on them already. I'm simply talking about future gains

Hong Kong has no gift taxes, and no taxes on capital gains. US is only the restrictive one

Yep since they'll surely be auditing a Hong Kong Citizen that got money from her husband. So suspiciousssss

I'm giving her money (completely legal), and in IRS view, she can do what she wants with it. I'm just not familiar with the laws as to how that is tax evasion / laundering
@_date: 2019-05-16 07:33:14
People in Hong Kong don't

The gift tax only kicks in at 11 million over your lifetime. I'm not giving her that much...

How is that illegal activity? If you put in a trade on your wife's or dad's crypto or stock account, are you going to jail?

Sending money isn't an issue, venmo had like 3k a week, cash app 1k a week, and could even use PayPal. I'd do this with both crypto and stocks, so adds up over time

Which part of this is tax evasion? I already paid taxes on the money I'm giving her. Why does the IRS care what happens to the money after that. To them, it is some Hong Kong Citizen doing trading, what do they care
