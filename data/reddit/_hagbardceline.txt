You should define public goods first.

Not surprised two Statist gangs got into a bloody battle with each other. That's what Statists do, they get violent. I'm not advocating for that though. Im advocating for free market security.
And since when is fire insurance ridiculous?
[Health care has been a State forced monopoly since medical licensing &amp; hospital accreditation was established.]( do yourself a favour and see how the price of medicine has skyrocketed since around 1910 or so. State patent laws are absurd as well.
@_date: 2016-04-14 19:21:25
wake up, there's only one gang that sticks a gun in your face every paycheck, takes their "fair share" and says "you're welcome".
You Statists are creeps..

free market anarchy.

Charming. I'm familiar with the concept.
Can you choose one example so we're talking about the same thing...
@_date: 2016-04-15 12:54:50
That was a rather  dodgy reply.
There State is incapable of "owning" property, unless you define theft and owning as the same thing. In which case you can ask How are you going to defend ~~public~~ **stolen** goods? The answer is, you're not going to. 
Individuals own things, the State steals things.
If your asking how things like air pollution could be handled....well, [obviously you're not familiar with mass action torts.](

"A Free-Market Monetary System and The Pretense of Knowledge" -Hayek
Good essay, check it out.
@_date: 2014-12-19 18:53:42
Call it what you want, but in a capitalist society workers are free to band together and openly compete against these wasteful heirarchies. Let 1000 blossoms bloom:)
Certainly you have no problem with other individuals peacfully choosing to work under a different organizational structure. No?
@_date: 2014-12-19 11:42:03
Ancaps simply use the NAP based on homesteading and voluntary contract transfer to identify aggressive v. Defensive violence when dealing with conflict over scarce goods. It's a subjective choice. Ancaps do point out, correctly, that you are the original owner of your body....its "a priori". No state needed.
In fact, the State will hunt down and stick in a cage, or kill,  individuals in a community if they try to live following the NAP.
@_date: 2014-12-19 11:44:26
It does end conversations, but not by any fault of the ancap. Usually it sends the Statist into some cognitive dissonance tailspin.

one of us is missing the point...but it isn't me.

Law doesn't = state regulations. That's what I think he was implying. So you got taken advantage of like naive fool by using some idiots magic the gathering site as your bank. Let's not clamor for the state to monopolize the regulation of this thing.
@_date: 2014-04-25 11:42:34
Lol! I love it! If the Statists are good at anything it is marketing! Follow their lead on this one...
@_date: 2014-12-19 11:25:34


Ummm, yeah, that's free market capitalism. And it's a beautiful thing.
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:13:47
It's not that I don't believe in science and math. It's just that you don't understand them.
In the field of economics there aren't any constant relations. If some tax-feeder sitting in his office notices a  15 per cent rise in the supply of maple syrup in New Hampshire at one definite span of time time was followed by a fall of 12 per cent in the price, he's learned nothing about the relationship these prices have for a different group of people each with their own marginal needs. In fact, his history report means nothing for even the same group of people at a different point in time. You THINK he measured the "elasticity of demand" of maple syrup. I KNOW all he has done is establish a unique and individual historical fact. You are not taking into account the variable nature of individual marginal values.
now we're done here.

Yeah..naturally I would phrase it more empathetically to those actually hurt but this is the beauty of capitalism. You get burned like this once maybe twice in your life and you come back like a jedi next time....and the world is better off for it.

Geez, why not huh? At this point though I'd be very surprised if the CIA, FBI or god only knows who else hasn't put the fear of god into this nerd. Some organization has to have taken the reigns away from this magic the gathering doofus by now, no?
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:30:00

You're kidding right? Statism is the great crime of our time, look around you, destruction, waste, theft, extortion....a huge majority carried out with Statism as a cover.
@_date: 2014-12-19 13:02:24
I agree, capitalists are hunted down like dogs and caged or killed. Statism would crumble in the face of true capitalism.

Thanks for the input m'good'sir.  He agrees with my principle though. Everything else and simply an attempt to justify not supporting it consistently.
ps. there is only one freedom, and that is "do what thou wilt". hate to break it to the sociology/poli sci crowd.
@_date: 2014-12-19 20:46:36
Ok so you call fascism/mercantilism capitalism. Got it.
But do you support people voluntarily banding together as they peacefully choose, in a manner agreeable to all parties involved, however that may be?
Do you support open competition in all markets?
You brought up scarcity, I subjectivly prefer homesteading and contract transfer to identify aggressor v. Defender when conflict arises over scarce resources. You have a more just method?
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:57:54
I agree totally.
Personally, at this point the free market has served as an excellent regulator so far.  Insightful holders pulled their money from gox, they're whole. The careless and naive.....well "a fool and his money are soon parted". 
I just would be highly cautious of ANYTHING touching gox at this point. There is no telling what's going on behind the curtains. False flags are totally in play.

@_date: 2015-01-18 15:23:39
Gold has a commodity value beyond it's use as money. That's why the State can make it virtually illegal to use gold as money and it maintains some tradable value.
I like Bitcoin. It is a decent crypto currency, just overpriced in my humble opinion. What's wrong with 13 dollar Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-07 23:17:56
Haha...it's posts like this that prove it's still amateur hour. How can I short this stuff? Is there a futures market for bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:23:11
"got  damnit"? such gore...
@_date: 2015-01-18 16:08:31
That makes zero sense. Are you trying to say demand for Bitcoin is going up?
@_date: 2015-01-18 15:24:46
Best of luck. I don't think it's a wise move if you're hoping for its value to appreciate over the next few years.
@_date: 2015-01-04 11:57:14
haha...profit taking.

yeah. hopefully maidsafe takes off.

I don't believe the world is flat. I don't believe that anyone has proven that humans are responsible for global warming or that global warming is a problem to begin with. I don't follow pop culture as closely as you do so I'm not sure what Jenny Mcarthy believes. As for vaccines, I was vaccinated as a child and have no ill effects. I don't support forced vaccinations, and the existence of this organization is an eyebrow raiser... 
Also, validity isn't determine by a popularity contest.
@_date: 2015-01-18 16:26:27
Yeah because demand for Bitcoin is going down...rapidly, and accelerating. But it does have a solid support via drug markets and the like, unfortunately that was proven to be anywhere from 13cents to 13 dollars before  the speculative retards, and the other economic illiterates became involved. I wouldn't be surprised if the State was hording them during the run up as well. Then brought the bloodbath when they sold out.
Again, I like Bitcoin but it would be unwise to mess with it until it goes back to those natural support levels.

@_date: 2015-01-18 12:50:23
it's heading to about 8-15 dollars I'd say. There is some value for it's use in the drug trade.
@_date: 2015-01-18 15:45:22
What do you think will be the bottom? Roughly. I think around $8-15, but 13Cents isn't out of the question.

how does theft, murder, kidnapping and counterfeiting, ie. The State equal conserving the freedom to exist?
How does the State, the most economically inefficient / possibly the biggest polluter on the planet equal pollution prevention?
To be candid you sound like you were raised and educated in some type of State indoctrination camp. The doublespeak, the blindly dismissed privilege...
