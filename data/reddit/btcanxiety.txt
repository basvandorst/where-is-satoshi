5 dimes is a a fiat gambling site. but they accept bitcoin also.

Hey Mike and Gavin too bad nobody has made any returns, except negative, for the past two years. It would be alot easier to convince the masses if Bitcoin was going up in price. Why dont you revisit this situation when we get to $1000 per coin.

Women in Bitcoin lmao. All they do is regurgitate what the men have been saying all along. Show me a woman who has something new to say and I may listen

probably the clearest and most concise answer I have read on here. You hit the nail on the head.

Face it, Ripple is a pump and dump that had a little bit more credibility than the others. This softens the blow of the end of Ripple, so it doesn't come across as looking like a total scam when Ripple goes belly up.

karples was actually running a ponzi. he would pay fiat out to those who were selling. but when the price went sky high not enough fiat came in to cover the sells. He was doomed, even if the price stayed at $250. He would have eventually run out of new fiat coming in. He never had enough capital to run an actual exchange from the start. Even if he had thousands of bitcoins he could have used to flood the market, he still didnt have fiat.

Lol whats the matter? Did you buy in at $400 or higher? Thats why youre not excited? Sux to be you. I am happy as a lark been buying since low $200's and it feels fucking fantastic!
@_date: 2015-07-30 23:23:43

3600 btc per day is spread out between thousands of miners in the world. Unless everyone of them sells at the end of the day its not going to effect the price.

op is going to empty the wallet once no more bits are being donated who is he trying to kid? Very clever way to scam some coins. gg

why would this news be any different. Good news is a selling opportunity for the whales. They continue and will continue to sell into good news. That way they dont crash the price. They immediately bleed out the new fiat that is coming in on good news. The price of bitcoin will trade sideways for probably a few years.

We are going to be millionaires boys. $1000 is chump change. All we need is a influential person or entity (Warren Buffet, Bill Gates) or some conglomerate to put their neck on the chopping block, go all in and say unrevokably that Bitcoin is "the SHIT" !We fly past $1000 easily. I think this hasn't happened yet because all the smart money is buying quietly. If Buffet said "buy" back when he first commented on bitcoin. We are having a conversation about going to $10k. Someone is buying all the miners coins each day. Other than whales rebalancing or bots trading back and forth, I can't imagine whatever is mined each day being sold on the open market. The price tanks $10 after a 500 coin dump. So someone is buying and hording the coins for sure. Soon Moon

Be patient. Let all these VC's throw their billions into the infrastructure. They are doing all the hard work of trying to get it mainstream. Wait until the VC's start buying the coins. We will eventually reap the rewards. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 17:40:28
not sure what you are saying? how to do the transaction quietly? all you need is a loaded paper wallet with 1 million btc on it and you trade that for the cash. nobody is the wiser.
@_date: 2015-04-06 21:17:05
why buy the coin?  i can put the shares in an ira each year and get $600 back in my refund

how long were you in for bro?
@_date: 2016-10-12 21:10:04
Waht do u mean? Amateur traders selling for maybe a $20 per coin profit from this little run up over the past few days is a pittance?
@_date: 2016-10-05 21:38:47
just way too many coins premined and currently being mined in eth to make any money in the long run. plus I have never seen such a stable crypto for such a long period. red flags
@_date: 2016-10-12 20:17:40
Why would the market makers let the market fall? Shorts are not done covering the supposed "drop" that we were supposed to have over the last 3 years???? Imo short squeezes are causing the rises not new money pouring into the market.

nothing is going to happen to the price its 10 coins. Now if the bid was for 500 or 1000 coins It would. I would imagine whoever is bidding is wanting to buy for the bragging rights associated with the trade. $4000 for 10 bitcoins and you can say forever that you had the first trade on wall street in bitcoin I would do that deal.
@_date: 2015-03-18 22:55:22
oh ok coinbase here is 130000 btc. please pay me $35 million. yeah right. It will be impossible to sell a significant amount of the coins on the open market.  $10000 throws up a red flag and has to be reported. this is fud
@_date: 2016-10-06 22:39:20
done deal, its going to happen. singapore, hong kong, the end of day auction settlement price greasing the right officials etc
@_date: 2015-03-23 15:54:42
read the filings, this isnt a stock. this trust fund is set up merely as an avenue for existing holders of the bit shares to cash out if they want. if they run out of shares to sell i guess they would go through existing ways to acquire more coins which obviously isnt the open market :(
