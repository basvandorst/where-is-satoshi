Bunch of high school investors in this thread.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:21:10
You're retarded.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:04:43
Losing unrealized money is still losing money you idiot.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:18:11
Didn't realize you can have negative brain cells.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:49:13
Lol, these people don't seem to understand how investing works at all... It's as if they don't realize how much money they just lost.
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:20:20
It's people copying answers dude. Look at the accounts. It's making fun of OP. It doesn't make any god damn sense. Yeah, this is all an elaborate way for us to all get our BTC back! There's no way Mt. Gox stole all our money! Praise Gaben!
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:44:42
Wanna explain the joke? I mean, I get he's saying a newspaper doesn't want people who question authority. I just don't get why he said it there, and if it's a joke, how?
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:00:44
This article is retarded.
@_date: 2014-03-09 00:31:16
Can I ask why Dorian, who at the age 10 moved to the US and learned english, and worked for fortune 500 companies and the US government acts so odd on TV. Is it the stroke? Do you understand why people might not believe you?
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:24:25


Not hundreds of millions on one inch piece of hardware that you could put anywhere. Yes this is fraud. But someone (*cough Karpeles cough*) stole about 400,000,000 USD worth of bitcoin. So laws obviously don't matter to whoever has it.
@_date: 2014-03-09 01:43:42
My mother is a stroke victim. Which I said about 2 comments down, which you apparently didn't bother to read. Go fuck yourself asshole. I asked a question, my mother seems odd to everyone, because she's a fucking stroke victim. I was asking a question. Go fuck yourself in your fat fucking ass.
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:30:43
That's not really at all what you said in your original comment. I never said you would be homeless, but you would definitely lose money. So you have something to gain from positive Bitcoin press.
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:33:13
He publicly seems like a dufus yet was a software engineer for fortune 500 companies and the US government. Either the stroke did him in or he's playing dumb. He also moved to the US when he was 10 and then became a high paid software engineer. So I don't want hear about how he can't speak English correctly, it's either the stroke or a lie.
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:53:33
What happened to everyone saying it was the US Government that stole the coins and Karpeles was an innocent pawn under gag order? Has the community given up on that fairy tale and finally realized that Karpeles had a couple hundred million dollars worth of anonymous crypto currency under his control and decided to retire?
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:03:51
He's been in the US for 50 years and has worked as a software engineer for fortune 500 countries and the US government, and apparently has enough money to retire, so he wasn't bad at it. Yet you put him in front of a camera and he's just a train loving Forest Gump. Sure. Like I said, it's either the stroke or a lie.
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:35:49
You've shown your colors. Enjoy your history. The fact that your comment was so upvoted, when it's common knowledge the mods stopped negative posts during the last crash is telling.  Very.
@_date: 2014-03-09 00:49:36
I was asking a simple question. I was asking Dorian's brother if he did change instantly after the stroke. Strokes affect people differently, some come through OK, some lose serious mental capacity. I was asking a simple question. But people, including you, downvote me. I don't know why.
@_date: 2014-03-09 02:43:41
I agree with you fully. they do deserve their peace. I just asked a question, as have everybody in this post. But I got buried.
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:36:34
Wait, did scientists invest in global warming? And the more scientists that agree with it (which at this point is almost all of them) they make more money? Do you know how grants work? Or peer review? Or, really, scientific progress in general works? If the answer was yes to any of those questions, you wouldn't be comparing it to a crypto currency who's initial investors/farmers stand to gain by positive news and suppressing ANYTHING negative.
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:30:49
Apparently Satoshi is a fucking genius with perfect grammar but not smart enough to fake ignorance if he had to. People on this subreddit are amazing.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:04:10
Except its different when Erik stands to gain large amounts of money from Bitcoin press.

Except it's pretty easy to hide them. You can hide a hundred million dollars worth on a flash drive that you store in your cars glove compartment box.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:06:20
Did you read the article? That's not what it said.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:59:41
How does he sound like that?
@_date: 2014-03-09 01:54:32
I only asked a question. I never denied his stroke or said if doesn't explain his character isms. But I got down votes for. Just asking his apparent brother. It was a simple question.
Upvote by the way, very few people will read this because of how down voted I got. But thank you for recognizing that I know this illness. It's shit.
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:30:24
Bruce really likes to hear himself talk (or type).
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:13:18
For real. Some anonymous guys could steal $2.7 (not 2.2) million dollars worth of anonymous currency and it would be next to impossible to find their real identities. Plus, it could help get them out of an illegal drug game which could put them in prison. I don't see how anybody ever thought this was a good idea. It would take a lot of trust on the userbase to go, on yeah, this anonymous guy has $2.7 million dollars worth of our anonymous currency in an escrow account and I'm sure he'll never be tempted.
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:19:57
Also, if you WERE the real Satoshi but wanted to stay private. Why not do everything in your power to make people not believe it's really ou?
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:51:37
Lol, usual bitcoin response. Nothing to see here folks. Keep investing so my BTC are worth more! Anarchy and libertarianism, don't forget.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:57:57
So you're saying that negative press will hurt your paycheck in other words. Not very reliable. Many of the people pushing the probitcoin narrative stand to make a lot of money. That's why people don't take them seriously.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:29:42
Good retort.
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:33:46
Same with my mom, and her stroke happened in her late 40's about 6-7 years ago. Stroke damage is often permanent and can change the person in extreme ways.
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:14:09
OpenSSL was open source too.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:18:48
That makes him halfway not retarded. Most high schoolers know to name check. I was more curious what he said makes you think he somehow questions authority... Because he spells correctly?
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:31:18
NO. Stick with the approved dialogue maggot.
@_date: 2014-03-09 00:43:55
Yeah, my mother had one when I was 19 and changed completely. I was asking a question and am now getting buried. The fuck.
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:20:26
It's a security risk to put that many coins in a hot wallet. So separate it into different wallets only makes sense
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:08:45
Well, you have proof now. But it was a pretty fucking big deal that the mods (who have a vested monetary interest in keeping bitcoin up) decided that "negative" or "emotional" posts would no longer be allowed after the last crash. Were you not here then?
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:55:42
Good luck suing a French citizen, in Japan, from America (assumption), over Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-04-13 14:37:50
He does know Tor was created by the government, right?
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:00:35
Couple hundred millions dollars worth of bitcoin? People have retired on much less.
@_date: 2016-01-27 22:25:20
Ah, so I'm just gonna have to wait a really long time :/. The service I sent it to requires 6 confirmations. What would be a good miners fee per byte, just curious?
@_date: 2016-01-28 16:29:14
Bitcoin won't die because it's incredibly useful to buy things on the DarkNet. Oh, and because there are a million hypemen sitting on small fortunes of Bitcoin who **can't** let the narrative change otherwise their investments drop.
@_date: 2016-01-28 03:05:06
Awesome, it ended up already being confirmed. Next time I'll make sure to look at that website and send the best fee.
@_date: 2016-01-27 22:59:55
What happens to people who don't put a fee in? Do they lose their bitcoins forever in bitcoin space or is it returned?
@_date: 2016-01-27 23:40:02


Could you possibly go into that a little more? So I could somehow resend it with higher fees? Cause I'd totally do that.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:52:46
Have you ever done the Secret Santa? You get your users name... I'm assuming if he's buying a WoW time card for them that they've said they play WoW.
