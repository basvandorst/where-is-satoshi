I'm buying because Bitcoin is being accepted at more places everyday and the theft didn't occur because of a flaw in bitcoin. If this were a bank, it wouldn't have has any affect on the dollar, I think it's the nature of crypto that users have the ability to act immediately, without delay that affected the price.
People panicked and sold their bitcoin based on the news itself (I'd venture a guess that many suspected an inherent flaw in Bitcoin was the cause rather than a combination of miner stuff and the heist).
Once the news was more fleshed out and it became apparent the theft had nothing to do with bitcoin per se, it stabilized somewhat in the mid-500s (where it has been for quite a while today).
As the days go on, people may be reimbursed a percentage of what they lost or maybe Bitfinex goes the way of the Dodo but in any case the panic will subside and as long as nothing major happens in the next few weeks, we'll likely be back in the upper 600s by the end of the month.
Please note, I'm a big time n00b and don't really know shit, this is just how I'm seeing it.

To be fair, he did mention "nothing to download" and may think the website is the "pc desktop version".

What about downloading via VPN, like TorGuard? Can't be put on a list if they don't know who you are (unless, of course, VPN's have been NSA comprimised themselves but that's another discussion).

Sounds good to me, I like the ShapeShift people. Although I've heard about them for a while I haven't tried it until yesterday and wouldn't you know it, I make a $2k transfer from Monero to Bitcoin and I forget the Payment ID. I wondered why it took so long.
Then I read notice on the page that if your forget the ID, you lose your money. Fuck.
My stomach dropped, I gathered all the info on the transaction and emailed them.
This was at like 3AM this morning, by this afternoon it was returned and I ran it again properly with no issues.
Scared the shit out of me but the quick turnaround time was impressive and with this news, I think I'll get a KeepKey to supplant my Raspberry Pi Cold Wallet just because of the customer service.
Can I get a hand for the ShapeShift folk?

Yep, I'm an IT Guy by trade and know pc and network  security pretty well, before I even bought my first bitcoin I came here to see how to buy, sell and store it and took most of the suggestions to heart.
I finally settled on Core (to do my part!) and Electrum in the end as they seem pretty secure and Electrum is crazy flexible accessing a single wallet by phone or pc  as long as they are accessed securely (which is done via a secure server I built and secured myself ) I should be safe as there in zero chance that machine can be infected and it's  behind a decent hardware firewall I got from a client that a few years back.
Though I do have a Raspberry Pi and am in the process of turning it into to a real cold storage solution (although, I'll likely store an encrypted image in my online backups with the kneys and whatnot with the same access rules).
Anyhow, that's the way I do it.
I'm pretty sure you had a keylogger installed though because it's not really possible to hack an encrypted file without the password  (and as long as the password is decent). If you didn't encrypt the pdf then that was all they needed.
Good advice to watch what you access from a day to day PC especially with even legitimate websites spreading malware through their advertising channels.
Edit: Just saw you used a winrar password only and I've seen those winrar password removal tools and stuff so yeah, at least you learned. If you haven't found out by now 7zip (that Ive used for years and years) is not only completely free it has kick ass encryption that is impossible to crack without the passcode.
By the way you can also encrypt pdf's securely with AES 256 encryption and a long, complex password (as it can be brute forced), the password is the weakest link, make it long and strong and create and only access from secured pcs you'll be cool.

He's right, that when I bought my first couple of coins it was at $680, just before the miner drop then Bitfinex, it hasn't hit that since and I bought a few more since then, but yes I remember the pre-Bitfinex price quite well.

Me too, he'll my first foray into crypto currency was just a couple of weeks ago @ 675, but I know from the past in similar circumstances Bitcoin dropped like a brick, this time the brakes seem to be coming on in the mid to high $500s, we're at $575 at the time of this post which is great I think.
Although I don't know shit, I predict a rebound sooner rather than later. It was just a theft, not anything to do with bitcoin at all other than that is what was stolen.
We'll be fine.

It may seem crazy to some, but I have a paper wallet that is printed on an encrypted pdf, put into an encrypted 7z/zip file and uploaded to my offline backup and another Dropbox-type online storage.
The way I see it would be next to impossible to lose and is secure from prying eyes even if I were hacked. I have a decently secured network and second PC that serves as a server isn't used for browsing or email to access it as it has an extremely low chance of being compromised by a virus or keylogger.
Though I'm not an expert in hacking or encryption, this is sufficient as a cold storage alternative, no?

I think it's my fault, the minute I got in it was at $675, as it traded down I'd buy at the, ridiculously at the time, cheap price only to see it drop further and further.
So, I've bought at $675, $630, $575, $506 (missed the $400s) and as it is now at $550, I'm down but not so bad.
Last week (or the week before or something) I bought ETH @ $14...dammit.
My apologies, I've seemed to curse the crypto market, but on the bright side, when luck hits it usually smacks the shit out of me so expect a spike, I can feel it.
Still learning and just randomly buying and holding (except for buying in btc) but having a blast even if I lose my ass (China hasn't freaked so we may be ok).

Jesus, every time I buy it reaches a new low and I just gotta buy more, such a vicious circle. However, I just don't see this affecting it long term, otoh I don't know shit so there's that.
Off to buy more, I hope I don't lose my ass!

As an 40 something entrepreneur, I have lost my ass multiple times, a few times I ended up homeless (couch surfing but no home of my own). The last time, a week after i lost an apartment, I also wrecked the car I had boughy a year prior that I still owed $12k on and had let the insurance lapse due to being flat broke and homeless.
Still, as shitty as it was, I carried on. Why? Because tomorrow may be a better day. And you know what? It's wasn't, but the next day was.
So eventually I made it back, then lost it again. Right now, I have more than I ever had but still, I could lose it anytime.
Super scary for being in my mid 40s, but the point is, you are going to die, guaranteed one day, it's coming no matter what, but even being flat broke, I found things that made me happy, or at least happy enough to carry on.  Death? No happy there.
The truth is, I was happiest when I was broke, it's strange, maybe because you can take bigger risks with less to lose or the fact that I became closer to people when they helped me out, I don't know but some of the best times I had were when I had nothing. 
So if it happens again, I know that though it willl be bad (especially at my age), it will also be good, the same emotions I experience with money I have without. It almost always works out anyhow, to varying degrees. So should I screw it up, I know worse case, I'll scrape up the basics.
 In the end, all you really need is the basics the rest is just fluff and the basics are easy to achieve, much easier than getting rich. Besides, death is guaranteed and final, at least with life, even in a really bad time, you can still be happy,. Again,  death? Not so much.
Hell, if most people can adapt to prison, slavery, and  authoritarian regime, missing out or losing some money aint shit. 
Suicide is just too final not to mention we really don't know what's next and if the Christians are right, suicide means you'll be on fire for eternity and I really don't see how that's better than living without a fortune and the other guys guesses don't sound much better.
So yeah, don't be like their brother. I'm sorry for them but it's such a permant solution to a temporary problem. There are still opportunities out there.

This may just be me but I transfered my balance (as I always do after buying) and accounted for the fee, when I sent it. I noticed my balance was the exact same as the fee, I think something is screwy and some are being sent as 0 fee transactions.
