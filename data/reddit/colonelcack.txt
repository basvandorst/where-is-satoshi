I asked a hooker if she accepted bitcoin. She told me no because it goes up and down more than she does.

Nullc, do you feel that this even will cause any rush to fix the TX bug in the bitcoin protocol? How big of a feat would this be to undertake? To be fair I don't totally understand it,  I just know it's been known about for so long why hasn't it been fixed sooner?

I see... Well that doesn't give me much hope.  Thanks for replying

Does this affect my trezor recovery seed key? If so, how?

I sent mine in a little late after the deadline via regular mail. Do I still have any hopes? 
@_date: 2016-11-07 18:47:46
Sure why not

Can someone please explain what I'm looking at/for when I look at this chart and these numbers? What do the bars represent? And what should I be paying attention to when reading the numbers(specifically the buy/sell numbers) ?

I've heard many people requesting this but I still don't understand totally.  What is shorting and leverage and how would they apply to bitcoin?
