Coinbase has fallen from grace with me over the past year. Recently, I've had to get support from them on 2 topics that I wouldn't think would've caused an issue, both of which were not settled in a reasonable amount of time. They held one of my deposits in their system and only cleared it once I inquired about the status of my deposit. They really need to beef up their support. The last thing you want when handling people's money is to be unresponsive, unclear, and unhelpful.

That can be done with proper rewards and marketing. I'm talking about pure infrastructure :).

Assuming someone had the resources to make a new pool in America (or some place other than China) and had access to 80GB/s internet speeds, what would it take to make a new pool to help alleviate this problem? Or would making a new pool not help?

While this could be considered plagiarism, I prefer to do my own work and research, it will come off as more credible and genuine. I may reference an Andreas video for some facts however. Thank you for the suggestion

I will most likely avoid any of the tech behind Bitcoin and solely talk about the advantage/disadvantes of both sides. I checked my savings account interest last week. It was 0.00025%, when my dad was my age, it was 5-8%. I would like to persuade my audience into considering alternative investments and commodities, other than bank offered ones for the exact reason you mentioned. The market has already been titled against younger investors, while new and emerging markets, like cryptocurrencies are still untapped and confusing to an older generation.

This is a bold fact, if it can be proven true. I like how you stated this, because it seems rather scary to someone who may not understand the entire economic situation. I will try to find a source proving this statement and use it for sure. Thank you.

I would like to thank everyone who responded. There are some amazing suggestions that I would've never thought of. I never expected this kind of support. This is a great community here. Thank you for all the help!

This was my exact intent. I was specifically looking for interesting facts with which to motivate them to do their own research. No tech-talk, there is too much to be said with no time to say it.

I agree this would show how useful it is. Lucky for me there was one student in the class who has used BTC before. He and I traded a few bucks last Friday for the laughs. I will most likely reference the transactions that took place that day. Thank you for the suggestion.

Saying they don't turn a profit is just plain wrong. Had an S9 for less than 3 months and have grabbed nearly $800 bucks or half of what I paid. One of the largest farms in the midwest is purely S9s at this point and has harvested nearly 750 bitcoin in less than 2 years. Saying they don't turn a profit is just plain wrong. I agree some of their products are less than acceptable quality and their warranty is a complete joke, but at least make a claim that at least has some validity if you're going to make one.
