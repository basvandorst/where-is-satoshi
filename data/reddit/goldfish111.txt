Is that a Square reader on Rinearson's iphone? Can anybody else see that?

Bitcoin idealists are probably the only ones willing to give this a try. Jaded investors in more traditional industries would never even consider this, but MtGox customers probably have a totally different outlook.
I hope people can organize a bid.

Could be that. Or, the usual interpretation is nerdy glasses dude with arms waving in the air.

I thought I misunderstood when I heard that. I'm going to wait for the transcript before passing judgement on that because otherwise .....

Oooh insurance and counter-party risk! This is an important hole in the cryptocurrency environment.
EDIT: Holy crap Ms. Rinearson also has a background with foreign exchange currency regulation?
EDIT2: 
EDIT3:  
Van Cleef represents traditional capital markets. Rinearson represents virtual currencies, of which (it seems) prepaid cards was one of the first to break ice back in the late 90s (using her words).
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:13:38
IANAL, nor do I know any of the panelists, but my thought is that Van Cleef is a rainmaker for her firm, with teams of people providing reports and summaries to her that she digests. She treads water in this panel, but would be an absolute shark in the networking and relationship arena. Notice earlier she dropped the hint that she attends bitcoin conferences.
On the other hand, Judie Rinearson is deep in the weeds as a hands-on partner. She speaks with great authority from a technical standpoint and earlier stated she represents several bitcoin companies. I hope NYDFS weighs her recommendation to provide light regulation and "not to come up with a whole new set of consumer rules."

I like the prepaid cards angle. This lady brings much more value to the table, literally, than Van Cleef.
EDIT: "this lady" refers to Judie Rinearson.

I'm not endorsing this middleware at all. Just trying to articulate the motivation and any possible or potential value-add. I don't think it should be done until well after a more conventional transfer of ownership has taken place, or further details from the civil rehabilitation have been revealed.

"People don't want to support a coin that makes other people rich. They like choice." --Charles Lee
Spoken in the context of people not liking pre-mined coins, but still.... "rich" in irony.

Oh shit. He just opened up the can of worms. "No chargebacks allowed." Fortunately nobody jumped on that.
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:08:34
Only because somebody threw out "$700 million" as a possible number to execute the 51% attack in the earlier panel. But yes, agreed that this was the only part of the point that was really valid vs. the rest of the items he referred to. 
Thankfully this is what the purpose of panels and hearings are for -- public official and departmental education. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:39:19
Programmable money. Regulators should be happy about this.
EDIT: I wish Charles was prepped better by his team/himself.
@_date: 2014-01-29 04:19:39
The key here is warranty, not necessarily charge-back. Another way of looking at this would be being able to reverse a transaction back into escrow with multi-sigs. This way, neither party gets access to the funds until the dispute is resolved. Incentive on both sides of the fence to make the transaction work out.

Mining is a systemic threat? Deputy superintendent forgot Fred Wilson's comparison of the miners as critical pieces of the bitcoin infrastructure, similar to how AWS is often used as critical infrastructure for web-driven products.
EDIT: Clarified the deputy superintendent's comment referring to "mining as a systemic threat" to the bitcoin network.

Woohoo! The commodity vs. currency classification. This is the biggest question that regulators have to wrestle with first.

Doesn't even have to be a third party in the US. Could be a more friendly jurisdiction (e.g. Singapore?). There are other considerations like how much capital is currently available, what other creditors are hankering after Gox assets and their ordering, plus putting together (hopefully) decent management and operating staff. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:57:02
Van Cleef was ABSOLUTELY paid for product placement based on her sale hooks back to the commodity backed currency. Thankfully she stumbled over the company name so nobody knows how to find it on google.
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:55:44
Bitcoin ATMs for underbanked consumers. Say it people!!!!
EDIT: They missed that angle, but Rinearson's point about smartphones getting into the hands of underbanked is valid as well since wifi is often free at many venues.
EDIT2: Van Cleef brought it up. I'm satisfied.
EDIT3: I wish somebody brought up M-PESA for mobile payment and branchless banking systems like those in Kenya and Tanzania, which is the canonical example of foreign "underbanked consumer segment".

They're trying to go meta. Bitcoinbuilder allows for an exchange of goxBTC and external BTC. But goxCoin is trying to allow anybody to trade the debt on a public blockchain instead of on the Bitcoinbuilder site because that's the fad.
Not sure what additional value it adds because there's less emphasis on *how* the coins will be recovered, but it seems more of a philosophical difference than anything else.
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:41:15
Did he just conflate coloured coins with programmable contracts? dang...
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:27:39
Talking about a *consumer* insurance protection fund. Interesting. Rinearson is recommending a completely separate mechanism or fund to handle counterparty risk (basically), but Charlie is asking why not use the same fund. 
The main issue seems to be the value volatility.
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:48:35
Yeah. Tax. Damn important for early adopters. :) Not so important for everybody else unless the value does another 10x. First world problems.
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:36:04
Crap I wish Charles would have used the analogy to the current financial industry's use of electricity. That is the standard counter-argument to this line of questioning.

She was paid or represents the company? I couldn't even get the name of the company.

Not sure how the witnesses are picked. I just got the list from

The value of the goxcoins is set by market participants based entirely on the viability of the recovery process, which could range from MtGox rebranding, community-based exchange or legal/bankruptcy &amp; forensic analysis recovery.
I see goxcoins more as a direct equivalent to shares in a community-based exchange or goxBonds, although the ability to convert the account balances into a blockchain format is that they can be traded via Mastercoin/XCP assets, centralized exchange or OTC. 
The two proposals are complimentary, and not mutually exclusive. Goxcoins is more how to create a secondary market for the outstanding goxDebt.

Vice, not CoinTrader.net. Their caption was a little amusing.

Pay an accountant to frame your tax position such that it is clear that the bitcoins you sold behave more as a capital asset rather than as income.
@_date: 2013-12-21 16:36:09
Agreed but it also means that if you obtain a comfort letter from a Tax Attorney you also open yourself up to increased scrutiny from the IRS. It's a double-edged sword. I am neither an accountant nor an attorney, but this was based on advice I received from a tax attorney.

If there were larger Chinese exchanges, why weren't they integrated into other charting sites?

So these guys will take care of compliance in the backend and whitelabel their backend and operational capabilities to further bitcoin adoption? Don't you need to still get money transmission licenses individually per whitelabel to comply with ${government} regulations?
