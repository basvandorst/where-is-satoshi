the price will double on the next halving, it will be then 30 Billion and in 2025, 2029,2034 will double everytime, then the marketcap will reach around 250 Billion and the transactioncosts will be much cheaper then today and the network adapted SegWit already and Schorr Signatures.

its a fact, we did not have war. its expensive, but weapons are not making peace alone.
i was talking about being united with 26 countries, thats like 26 altcoins together making one decission. its completely not possible and people would call you crazy to do that. everyone in the world is saying our union will break up.
its very interesting to see how the politician are fighting every day, but its still together. that is just beautiful.

another dude thinking he is fighting banks and state while destroying bitcoin because fighting against a technical solution. 
Therefor i just pledge contribution to the bitcoin must be anonymous, the same as satoshi. otherwise they will be groups attacking each other saying they have the best solution, instead of looking at the tech. 
at the end there are just emotions that play out full of rage or love, instead of rational discussion making. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:02:21
Definitly not. Its war between bitcoin and bitcoin. No banks involved and no state or you are on drugs.
Its definitly a hostile politics discussion without compromises or consensus seeking, just up to destroy bitcoin by forking it. What means its dividing its power as having the advantage of quasi monopol. Thats whats making him powerful. Its still 5 times bigger then the next coin.
so you are dreaming or just allitarete or full of hormons to harm destroy, without looking at the consequences.
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:41:03
its making no difference. if you have war like now, and you flame the other party, its giving the war more and more energy. 
splitting coin will be a huge negative impact for bitcoin. 
war is filled with negative energy like yours and is leading just to more destruction like your flamming post here filled with anger and hatred. Well made anakin, just kill now.
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:37:03
so when everyone would agree on a difficulty hard fork, it would be used to stay in 10 minutes block time.
I do hope there will be no split, because then the power of bitcoin would be much more less. one mega coin is needed to face fiat and getting new users.
eth is still too little yet.

EU is the most democratic group of countries in the world. its a miracle its working. 
The greece crises, the muslim and african invasion in 2015 and ongoing... really hard times. different solutions and still no war between us, no seperation, no forks (hahah)
China and one party politics is pretty easy. United  States of America is more difficult, but they had not the history of fighting each other for 1000 of years.
And yes, we have the commission with 20 people which are nominated and not elected. the world cant be perfect, yet.
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:44:38
Thats not the way the world works.
of course CIA is having access to Tor, they are even paying the development, so they are cooperating. 
Cia and Tor found a compromise to live together, without destroying each other.
Alliteration is going to destroy Bitcoin. Its ok, but its just so sad.
Guys, it was so nice, going to see you on the one or the other side of bitcoin.
I do hope, at least some of you, are going to learn your lesson.
We in Europe we had to learn it in so many wars you cant believe, now we are on a good way, as long alliteration will not stop us.
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:26:41


Segwit is a proposal from Core. It cant be a compromise.
Its so sad so many people are alliterate in Bitcoin and Altcoins.
The developers might be technically good, but they are very poor educated or are not listening to literate people.

the bigger the blocks the more txs, the more users, the lower the tx price.  
  
2mb is very reasonable and a compromise to get consens, thats democrasy, thats against wars, thats how people can prosper.  
  
you want to destroy it?
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:19:16
ethereum is not a currency by design. investing in cryptos is very common, just dont get scammed.

the market never repeat the same. in 2014 i stopped holding btc and was selling rather than holding until $250, then i started buying again.
in a market you can trade for making money. thats an advantage, bitcoins you to use.
this time it will also not go to $2000, maybe we will hit $1200. But price predictions are usually wrong. You can just make an analysis for a short period of time. Its like the weather forecast.
Wealth, i think, depends alot on luck. When a tradeobject is rising and you trade it, you will get profit what ever you make, as long you dont short. its very easy. 
BTC price prediction, serious one, no one will tell you. You will just find analysis.
@_date: 2017-04-19 19:44:18
you have my support
@_date: 2017-04-18 10:02:51
You can support UASF, thats enough to destribute power for btc changes.
@_date: 2017-04-18 10:15:09
believe in the tech development. now a transaction can be make 70% smaller then it is now. 
there will be much more development in the blockchain sector, it will be adopted by bitcoin before the next halfing
@_date: 2017-04-22 16:19:03
i guess 50% of the market runs asicboost. 
Segwit will be UASF activated very soon. Probably the same time when it goes on LTC. 
@_date: 2017-04-27 18:34:11
and after the 10mb blocks are full, i demand an 100mb block.
wtf? 
ever heard of 2nd layer with sidechains, tunneling, channeling txs?
@_date: 2017-04-18 19:43:36
lets just push developing bitcoin extended blocks or usaf for segwit. 
ignore the clowns
@_date: 2017-04-26 14:09:35
so never update a software with new features, because you are increasing the surface of attack.
You are an altcoin holder for sure and want harm bitcoin. i hope you get banned from here and then you are going to complain on btc.
@_date: 2017-04-19 12:36:10
BU is destructive and it was holding Bitcoin from scalling x1000 instead they wanted to make x32. bu is not the future.

ex Spondoolies' CEO built up a btc pool for bitmain. read the news
@_date: 2017-04-12 09:43:50
and this 
@_date: 2017-04-13 11:20:41
first of all we need development in efficiency, network capability and security.
there has to be progress. how ever this is approached and what type of evolution find place stands in second place.
we have to have the best bitcoin possible - users defined. miners are users, users are investors, investors are miners or users. we are all in one boat. its not just that miners  are defining bitcoin. thats satoshis vision.
@_date: 2017-04-12 09:33:31
JihanWu Bitcoins you want to support? honestly, because you hodling altcoins you want to see going up?

Tether is the latest and perhaps most high-profile project to attempt to use the blockchain's functionality as a ledger to move digital tokens that represent real currency.
For example, early crypto 2.0 platform BitShares has notably launched BitShares X, a family of decentralised autonomous companies (DACs) that issued its asset-backed token, BitUSD.
Collins positioned Tether as a more simplistic solution than those offered by its competitors, noting that its offerings, USTether (US+), EuroTether (EU+) and YenTether (JP+) cease to exist when they are redeemed with the service.
"These assets are created and destroyed on the fly. These are purely digital dollars. This is just representing dollars in our bank account," Collins explained.
Collins indicated that the number of Tether tokens in circulation will always equate to the dollars in its bank account, adding that there are no pegs or formulas that complicate the process for its partners.
"When you want to redeem them, we issue you cash," he said.
USTether, Collins suggested, will be available immediately to those accepted into the beta, while EuroTether and YenTether will be "done very soon".

there is just one bitcoin with one chain and 2nd layers. any other chain is not bitcoin chain. you can call it what ever you want, its a fork. something very common in open source software. no one is afraid of that.
we are afraid of roger or jihan forking bitcoin and call it bitcoin. therefor core is not hard forking. 
@_date: 2017-04-24 05:42:46
do we wait until he kicked out everyone out of the business? or do we act as a community pro bitcoin and not against bitcoin and pro altcoins like btc thread is doing.
@_date: 2017-04-24 05:53:57
it will be fine
@_date: 2017-04-28 15:56:21
tether price is rising 0.5% a day. so in 20 days everything should be ok again
