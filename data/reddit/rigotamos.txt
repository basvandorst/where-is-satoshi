I agree completely. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 02:37:12
Thanks for the input! Yes, this is the future. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:27:43
Would you like to explain how, or should we just take your word for it? 
@_date: 2014-03-19 20:23:46
Yes but, how? 
@_date: 2014-03-21 14:48:39
I guess a college neighborhood would make sense, given the infancy of Bitcoin. It'll spread soon I hope.
And no I asked them about that, it was a spur of the moment thing. They were trying to work out the best way to put a QR code on the tip jar. I suggested printing one out on photo paper.

If this person is in Switzerland, Google Maps says it is here: 
@_date: 2014-03-31 00:44:15
Hahaha, agreed. What's the link?
@_date: 2014-03-30 16:02:52
Thanks for the advise. Also, I am a leaf on the wind. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 20:37:52
Now it is starting to make sense, thank you. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 15:07:09
Robopocalypse. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 03:06:34
Gotcha, thanks. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 01:28:45
That's the one thing, I always feel weird trying to explain it. But I agree, Coinbase makes it easy to understand and use. I'm opening up a store soon and I will most definitely accept Bitcoin. I cannot wait for my first non-fiat payment. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 05:45:06
Oh I am no fool, it was way to suspicious. Especially "The Google Accounts team"
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:55:44
No it is not. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 20:17:56
This doesn't explain anything. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:51:04
I don't understand what this means. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:54:47
It will never reach zero. It will not even come close to it. It's okay, though, not everyone knows what they are taking about.
@_date: 2014-03-03 02:50:18
I would correct you if I know what you know, haha. So tell me please, what would I study to learn all these codes and algorithms? I would very much like to understand this further. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 14:10:50
What a game last night, though! :)
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:46:46
Honestly, that never crossed my mind. I would never do anything to gain the mistrust of the Bitcoin community. I have been and will always be a firm believer in Bitcoin for a very long time and I have started this BitLotto, not only for the worldwide entertainment, but in hopes to spread the word. And that word is Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:59:52
I'd be more lucky winning the powerball than a block! Hahaha. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 23:34:55
Despair?? I am talking about the complete opposite. Context, man, context. Grab a brain while you are it. 
Edit: Let's all up vote the first guy that misunderstood the whole point!! :D

Walked by Antoon's earlier; QR code has been placed. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:59:04
But I do understand your concerns and I know trust is everything. That is why I am open to all questions, ideas or methods and will cooperate in any way possible. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 01:35:15
I agree, the entire financial system is flawed and now outdated. But what sort of fees and restrictions do you mean?
@_date: 2014-03-21 14:11:37
Antoon's!! They're located in the Oakland area. For now they have an address written on the tip jar, QR code soon to come. And it's so smart too because it just makes tipping much more convenient.
@_date: 2014-03-15 00:48:54
How did you find a contractor that accepts bitcoin? That's great. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:28:38
Supernatural? Not so much. We are on the brink of technological breakthroughs each and every day. 
Although, I would not mind a '67 chevy impala four door ;)
@_date: 2014-03-30 05:11:16
They are. Via Coinbase. I have two accounts on Coinbase; my test email account, with a moderately difficult password and zero coins in the account, and my primary anonymous email account with a very strong password and two-type authentication. The former being the email in question. Changed to a very strong password. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:30:27
It definitely would be horrible, in the wrong hands. But what about the correct one?
@_date: 2014-03-03 02:51:31
What would I study to learn all these codes and algorithms? I would very much like to understand this much further.
@_date: 2014-03-19 20:21:46
To conspiracy theorists, nothing is good news. Just looking for a spin. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 02:17:11
I didn't say I don't believe you, sir. I said I cannot agree with that. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:34:17
You say that, but I just cannot agree with that. Do you know how fast a QC's hash rate would be? 
@_date: 2014-03-30 16:00:39
Lol yeah sorry that doesn't make much sense. I have a concussion, made sense when I was typing.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:51:22
Lol, I love how you assume I am a noob just because my account is new. Because there is no possible way I deleted my old account and started fresh ;)
@_date: 2014-04-17 21:24:06
Well I doubt there's any way you'll trust me, but I hope others will. This is truly for a good cause and I would never attempt to steal any amount of bitcoin from anyone. For one it is tracked so you can see exactly where it goes. And two, I don't need that kind of negative attention from the world. I have morals.
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:21:04
Let me break it down a bit as to not confuse anyone. Fantasy world where fiat doesn't excist and crypto brings peace to all. I want a loan to buy my mid-space condo with optional poolhouse. Loans are **.99%. How does that work?
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:19:49
That's fine, just needed a correct direction, should be able to take it from there. Thanks for the info, questions need answered. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:14:16
What is with the down votes? Damn trolls. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:25:48
The next five years should be every interesting.
