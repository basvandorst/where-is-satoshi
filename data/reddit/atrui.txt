Honestly you make more money day trading than hodl retards. It doesn't even take effort. If you set your notifications to send an email when your order has been executed you don't even have to look. But for day trading price doesn't matter. It s not like you can say oh I got in at 965 level. It s more like I got in at 1060 got out at 1103. Got in at 1070. Got out at 1113.

I'm not trying to figure out how high it will go but what price it should be at a given time. 
For example with stocks they use technical analysis and consider that a EPS of X may mean the company has reached overvalued territory. That wouldn't stop people from investing. I know Amazon and Tesla for example defy technical analysis and have not earned a profit for long periods of time. In those cases analysts say yes the price may be justified if X or Y happens or maybe in X amount of time that value may be fair but not at this point in time.

If you look at 1 minute you will go crazy. If you look at it daily you will too. Think about January 2019. Do you think in January 2019 it will be higher ? Then buy and hold. You think it will be lower ? Then sell now. 
Korea drove the market down more than 40% despite being estimated at being 20% of the market. The kimchi premium was over 25% at one point and now it s under 10%.
As a result of government crackdown new accounts have been banned and foreigners and minors as well. New rules start today and will start getting into effect as exchanges start applying them.
You can see Korbit explaining their internal process. I imagine Bithumb and others are going through the same thing. 
Don't trust a stranger with your money decisions but I think this will be very positive in the next few weeks Koreans have already cleared FUD. They are regulated now. And they can go back to invest with more confidence than before. Those crazies will soon drive that kimchi premium higher now that they know for sure government has already gotten a position on bitcoin.

I think you overestimate the power of one country and fail to grasp the concept of a global currency. There are no major kimchicoins localized to Korea. In other words the risk should be spread but something s not right when one country can take crypto down from 750B Market cap to 450B. That's a 40% downside and there's no way you can tell me that Korea is 40% of the crypto market. Even if all of them sold yesterday. 
What I'm saying is crypto needs to be more resilient than this to be the global currency it aims to be.

@_date: 2018-01-18 08:04:36
I keep saying it crypto is too vulnerable to be a currency that is independent of government. A currency that is not controlled by governments can't be influenced by government statements. South Korea has a population of 50m. Not a small number but compared to the 300m in USA, 127m in Japan, 36m in Canada and 700m in Europe it is a drop in the bucket. Even if the entire country was on crypto we are talking about a global project. And yet one country can take the whole crypto down. Imagine how a ban in USA would look or a ban in Europe. If crypto wants not to be controlled by government it needs some sort of resilience to government events.

A few weeks ago Korea regulated and added rules that spooked the market. Now they have banned anonymous accounts and banned people from creating accounts. In a week or 2 new accounts can be created.
For example this is Korbit s email. (I have a level 0 account)
Registration Process for New KRW Deposit Method
The new bank verification and KRW deposit method has begun. If you had tried to previously register on 01/30/2018 and went through the EDD process on the Shinhan site without success or you had issues with the deposit number issuance on the Korbit site, please note that these issues for the most part have now been resolved. 
In compliance with the regulations, all previously issued KRW deposit accounts before 01/30/2018 will be terminated. You will need to register a Shinhan Bank account to be allowed to deposit KRW onto Korbit.
When you register a Shinhan Bank account under your legal name, a new KRW deposit number will be issued.
To ensure a consistent implementation of the new method, we are inviting you in two cohorts to complete the registration process: 
Cohort 1
Registration Period: 10:00 KST on 01/30/2018 to 12:00 KST on 02/06/2018
Eligibility: Hold an existing KRW deposit account as of 00:00 KST on 01/30/2018
Cohort 2
Registration Period: From 12:00 KST on 02/06/2018 onwards
Eligibility: All members
Even if you are in Cohort 1, you may still register after 12:00 KST on 02/06/2018. However, we would strongly urge you to complete the process before then.
The prospect of registering as a new trader is undergoing negotiations. We will inform you once we reach a consensus.
You will be able to withdraw KRW to the registered bank withdrawal account after a temporary interruption that ends at 10:00 KST on 01/30/2018. You do not need to register a new verified Shinhan Bank account to withdraw KRW.
Please review the following to expedite the registration process:
Hold or create a Shinhan Bank account under your legal name.
Enable mobile / Internet banking at Shinhan Bank.
Ensure that the mobile phone number is the same at Korbit and Shinhan.
Those who have already been using a Shinhan Bank account must also follow the procedure to register an account. 
Please note that only Korean nationals may be issued a new KRW deposit number.
Thank you.
Thank you.

The thing is you have to understand the crypto revolution. Crypto currencies end goal is to replace money. To take out centralized locally controlled currencies and move people to currencies controlled by the blockchain. In that future where everyone moves into a single currency bitcoin comes out stronger than other currencies. Think of bitcoin kinda like the euro vs all other European currencies it replaced. Now imagine that bitcoin affects the entire world instead of the eurozone. The euro had volatility too and it has traded from 0.8 of a dollar to around 1.5 dollar. But it is a solid reserve currency right now. The process for bitcoin will be a lot longer because it requires reaching critical mass where people all over the world switch.

Dollars means nothing. Trade does. Currency is just a facilitator of trade. It is easier to trade 50 dollars for a car service than trading 50 cows for 20 computers.
I am originally from Puerto Rico. Years ago Chavez offered us oil and our governor wanted to do it. But we are a US territory. The deal of cheap oil was very enticing but our senate was debating the legality of accepting aid from Venezuela and our status as an effective colony of US. The governor was threatened with jail and what not and it didn't happen. As a US colony PR doesnt control its own trade. The governor hinted he would challenge the US and dare them to jail his ass but he stood down. I thought it would have been interesting from a point of view of setting a precedent in our self determination rights.
Chavez also used oil across South America to cut the influence of the IMF and USA. That s why USA really hated him. He offered loans based on oil. Basically Chavez cut US influence and South America is not fond of US due to many interventions. 
Anyway the point is you can use anything to trade. They traded oil for doctors with Cuba, crops with other countries and many other things. Trade is what makes countries free and prosperous. Every shitty country can be measured by their number and quality of trading partners. NK, Cuba, Syria as obvious shitty countries with very few trading partners. Libya saw Gadaffi removed and trading partners increased and economy growth. 
Tl;dr cut chavez policies out. US will invest in Venezuela and make it prosperous.

"Even as other countries have backed off from doing business with Venezuela, China has doubled down on its support. Over the past decade, Venezuela received over $62 billion from China, which is 53 percent of all money lent by China to Latin America. China currently owns $23 billion worth of Venezuela’s foreign debt, making it the country’s biggest creditor.
Venezuela is in the midst of a man-made economic and humanitarian disaster, driving an unprecedented refugee crisis, hyperinflation, and the biggest oil production collapse in the country’s history. Until recently, China was essentially the sole provider of cash to help the Maduro government honor its debt. Venezuela has not paid a sovereign bond since September 2017 and, according to sources at Caracas Capital, is now in default on 16 sovereign bonds and coupons totaling $1.81 billion."

The thing is people say socialism and ignore the real problem. China is communist, and not exactly a democracy. They are not struggling. As a matter of fact they are set to overtake the American economy unless we change course fast. And our useless congress is not taking the matter seriously to correct course. So to blame their economic system is to take a quick answer that doesn't really address their problem. Their problem is trading partners. 
Remove any US or EU members from the list and you'll see why they have to submit to their will or face their wrath. In reality the problem is that the Chavez policies, which Maduro is continuing run counter to US interest in the region. This is the problem that we are really trying to address. Basically return South America to the IMF and normal sphere of influence.
This is the turning point for Venezuela. Not socialism. Geopolitics man. 
"Venezuela has been loosening its ties to the IMF and the World Bank since Mr Chávez took office in 1999. Venezuela recently repaid its debts to the World Bank five years ahead of schedule. In doing so it saved $8m (£3.99m) and cleared all its debts to the IMF shortly after Mr Chávez was elected."
"The Venezuelan economy has experienced 10 consecutive quarters of sustained high growth. This is due in large part to high public spending and private consumption, fuelled by high oil prices and historically low interest rates."
Tl;dr Hugo Chavez cut down IMF influence in South America and pitted Venezuela against American interests.

China is a communist dictatorship. USA deals with them on a constant basis. Internet is censored. People are monitored. No one bats an eye. Because all in all China still dances to the tune of the USA. 
Saudi Arabia is a monarchy. Women are barely starting to get driving rights. Women still have to fight to have the same rights as men. Muslims theocracy and what not. But we still trade with them because we need them.

On August 24, 2017, President Trump issued E.O. 13808 “Imposing Additional Sanctions with Respect to the Situation in Venezuela.” This Order, among other things, prohibits transactions by a United States person or within the United States related to certain new debt of Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) and certain new debt or new equity of the Government of Venezuela, existing bonds issued by the Government of Venezuela prior to August 25, 2017, and dividend payments or other distributions of profits to the Government of Venezuela from any entity owned or controlled by the Government of Venezuela. In addition, E.O, 13808 prohibits the purchase by a U.S. person or within the United States of most securities from the Government of Venezuela.

You cannot block the American economy. The reason is we have the most trading partners. This is how we sanctions countries to death. Assume the world turned on us. For example cus they are mad at Trump pulling out of every international accord. Let s say EU sanctions us, we still trade with much of the rest of the world. Anything smaller than EU is meaningless and we can cut trade ourselves. We are the main trading partner of much of the world. 
And that is the reason that we can sanction others cus they have maybe 2 or 3 trading partners and we can work with them to block at least 80% of their trade.

There s nothing technical. There is FOMO phases and FUD. Technical people invest in stocks. What technical analysis can you make of a currency ? EUR/USD for example. 
FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) makes it go down. Basically any news that makes weak investors sell. 
FOMO (fear of missing out) makes it go up. Basically greed.

The problem with crypto is that the price is too volatile. When countries issue new currency sometimes they peg to the dollar to gain trust and then they detach and live on their own. Without that stability crypto cannot be used for sales or services. 
Exchanges have made crypto accessible but it s also a point of failure. The system tries to cut the middle man but now your middle man is an exchange. And for the current banking infrastructure it s very easy to mess with exchanges.

"Dip never came" that fomo is at religion levels. It dips EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. If it goes up and you miss the ride it s ok. You can always catch the next dip. Don't get stuck on the price. You all believe it s going to the moon anyway when you hold. So your blind faith assumes it s going to infinite anyway.

This is why you are afraid bro. Terrible math skills. 
1000  = 40
40x365 = 14600. 
Put another way. 
4% x 365 = 1460%

Dude it s fail proof. Wait a dip. It dips every day. Set a buy point. Every exchange has daily high and lows. Wait for a price close to the lows. You can actually set this with a buy order. At this moment for example 9750 is a decent entry point. Once that order executes sell at 4% higher 10140. You could have done that in the past 24h. Come check tomorrow if it s still valid. Do this exercise for a week and you tell me if it works.

Easy to write fud when crypto has been on the downtrend for a while. What you want them to write ? Bullish articles ? It s been like a month of crashing.
@_date: 2018-02-01 04:20:08
You don't get it. Realizing the loss. Is meaningless if bitcoin keeps oscillating. 
Say bitcoin went down 40%. 
Scenario 1 hold. Massive loss.
Scenario 2: realize loss! 
Buy after dip. Ride a 5% Sell. Wait for dip. Rinse repeat. Now watch a chart and tell me how that doesn't work. Just crunch the numbers instead of repeating memes. You could have recovered all your money with this up and down bitcoin has been doing. 
Bitcoin has oscillated between 9690 to 10295 in the past 24h . That s 6% from lowest point to highest point. You can easily make 4% daily. I guarantee you.

@_date: 2018-02-01 04:32:08
No. Just buy high sell low. This market is irrational. All patterns are useless. Bad news are unrelated to the market. 
Korea for example took down the market 40%. No pattern no nothing. Just a crash. This is not a science. Just a bunch of greedy people trying to get rich quick.
All that pseudo science is pointless. By the time you have a pattern it s too late anyway. Just stick to your rules.

I gave you the answer! Choose an entry and exit point. Price is irrelevant. What is relevant is the % you ride to make your money grow. Don't be scared. Try it with 100 dollars. Tell me in a week if it works for you or not.

Because owning your identity gives you freedom. See the passport example.
For a company it could give you access to multiple secured facilities.
For the police it could provide intergovernmental cooperation.

Sorry. My ex and my current gf both have said I lack that thing you are talking about. I honestly don't know what it means.
I haven't lost trades yet though. The only time "I lose money" is when I sell to reposition myself. I sell coins at a loss. Use the money to buy more coins after the dip. I make 2 - 5 % sometimes. (coin value)

Im not betting against butcoin but imagine you had pie  for sale. You are the only seller in town. Now imagine over 1000 other sellers. Imagine that the 2nd guy has 60% of your sales. 
That s the situation. With previous crashes. 
Past performance doesn't necessarily correlate with future performance.

In 2013 bitcoin didn't have many alt coins. Ether is getting close and it looks ready to pass bitcoin by market cap. The distance is getting shorter and shorter. 
Bitcoin won't die but this isn't 2013. Bitcoin market share is 33% now and reducing. Competing coins change the entire dynamics

Institutional money may never get in. Crypto is too unstable and there s no way to predict what will happen or pick winners and losers. For example with stocks you know Google is a winner and duckduckgo is a non competitor. With crypto it s hard to predict that bitcoin will not be the last man standing. Bitcoin may be MySpace but who will be Facebook. Cus they want their money on Facebook and not MySpace. That s not to say bitcoin is not Facebook but who knows!??
@_date: 2018-04-21 21:06:17
The key to adoption is accessibility. In the first few years it was very hard to obtain bitcoin. In comparison it has gotten a lot easier. But that is not always the case for third world countries where technologies tend to lag behind. A majority of the exchanges are either in US or Japan and Korea. Once more exchanges penetrate the world adoption will rise.
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:20:20
Because the wild swings of the Venezuelan, or African currencies are worse than bitcoin for starters. I think Zimbabwe is the country I'm thinking but i forgot. Or Syria or countries where conditions change and currency can quickly deflate.

If you are happy to ignore information based on who is the source you are already censoring half the planet. Is America the only reliable source of information? What if the person listening is Russian, Syrian, Iranian or Cuban? Or worse what if we are talking about people that are not on anyone s radar like Djibouti, Mauritania, Malta, Kyrgyzstan or Brunei? Free speech has no nationality.

No one will throw 5mill in a risky transaction. For smart people high risk transactions should be 10% maximum of your portfolio. Someone with 5mill has many ways to get massive profits from traditional investments. 
What will make bitcoin grow is not traditional money but regular joes moving 100 or 200 dollars. You would have to be completely out of your mind to risk 5 million to a 50-80% wipeout.

We ll see. If bitcoin becomes mainstream it may be possible they will have to jump in. Amazon is making some moves but it s too early to tell. Amazons CEO answers to investors in hard cash. YoY EPS and other hard cash numbers. Not in crypto. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:32:25
Institutional money power play is made in cash. Surrendering to bitcoin makes them vulnerable, not powerful. 
As an example assume that a new currency called Marty is the new trend. Do you think they will move after they have ammassed riches in dollars? What about when a new currency called McFly is the new dog? 
Speculating that they will get in is pure speculation. And I honestly believe that is more wishful thinking. That doesnt mean bitcoin wont fly high. The rest of the world has cash. But the 1% of America and the 0.01% of America that owns over 50% of the wealth will never trade the power of the dollar for anything else. Be it bitcoins euros or yens.
