I see more gloom and doom, Bitcoin Bubble headlines more than anything else, so I guess we are going higher until most Bitcoin critics capitulate and buy into the Bitcoin crazy.

I pre-ordered a pair because I cruise almost every year.  This is cheaper than paying outrageous call/txt roaming charges in international water and more discreet than 2-way radios.  I also want to see if I can hack it to transmit and verify bitcoin transactions if I pair the other goTenna with a phone or computer with Internet connection.

The location of the safe is the issue as MtGox has stated most of the coins were "stolen", meaning they are not inside the safe, but since this is bitcoin and we can looking inside the safe and see all of the money is still there.  So they are basically lying about the money being stolen/gone when the community correctly points out the money is  still in your safe.

Good one, you see right through his BS..  I am really asking this tax avoidance question for another party and not for myself...  yeah sure, this 3rd party is somehow trusting someone who is as clueless about Bitcoin to sell off his multi-million dollars worth of BTC stash instead of researching himself/herself?  You want to avoid IRS and tax?  Donate most of it to charity and you can claim some for yourself tax free.

I understand everyone is dismissing of Goldberg because of his latest $3.50 prediction, but just to counter he is not completely crazy and clueless, his analysis on May 30th is almost dead on, Bitcoin reached a low of $1835 on July 16th.  
People always get swept up by incredible raise in prices, but you know the saying "be fearful when others are greedy".  And let's stop with all the worthless price meme and if you feel the same way, downvote all meme with prices or imply how fast Bitcoin is raising which has no relevant to Bitcoin's future.

Same as Gold and yet it is worth $7+ trillion and there is no limited to the amount of gold you can mine on earth and fairly soon in outer space.  You can’t store gold inside your head and you can’t send gold as easily as you can send email to anybody anywhere in the world.

What is your background?  Tone Vays is going to call bs on this.  He was a Wall Street trader and had a great track record of studying market dynamic of Bitcoins for the last few years.  He said the Future won’t have much effect and the underplaying assets leads the future prices and not the other way around.  Watched his YouTube video and he explained why it is ridiculous to believe future contract to affect 500 different companies composing the S&amp;P 500.

How many stories did you read?  Aren't some of the stories about the same person?  Did you account for duplicates?  Did you track how the # of stories increase over time?  And you do realize as Bitcoin becomes more mainstream, there will naturally be more buyers of all types - those who borrowed money as well as buyers selling their fiat, gold, etc.  Do you see a dramatic ratio increase between Bitcoin purchasers using credit versus asset?
My guess is NO... so you read a **"number of stories"** on this subreddit?  And based on that **you think** "The amount of people taking out loans to buy BTC is **scary**"?
Can you define what is your definition of "scary"?  Scarier than people selling everything and borrowing to gamble at casinos?  buying stock options?  Buying illegal drugs?

Funny, you must be looking at a different subreddit.
Because all I see are useless **meme** telling what we already know.  ATH $5000, $6000, $7000, $7001, $7000.000001 .....
There are more stories of people paying off their house, student loan, debt, be able to eat than people selling everything and borrowing to buy Bitcoin.
If it isn't Bitcoin, it will be some other risky investment like penny stocks, gambling online/casino for those crazy people.  They like the thrill and risk and it is not because Bitcoin making them that way.  Blaming bitcoin or this subreddit is just Stupid.

I don't think you use very good examples as all these companies are still around today and doing well.
So what is your point?  That companies/people made inaccurate predication sometime?  Duh, of course!  And being dismissive of new technology is okay because it didn't really hurt them in the long run?  This runs contrary to most bitcoin fanatics here that think any company or anyone who is dismissive or saying anything negative of bitcoin will cease to exist.  Surprise this doesn't get downvoted to death.

Sure, but is someone going to care for bitcoin 2.0 even if you give it out for free?  BTW, you can't create Bitcoin 2.0 that is completely identical to 1.0 because it will be on a different blockchain and there is no network effect (miners and nodes) to protect it from attack/double-spending, which is what makes Bitcoin unique and valuable.  If I invent a new Internet 2.0 today that use a different network protocol than TCP/IP, which will require computer software change and people to start using this new Internet 2.0, how success would that be?  Even if I make it freely available and no charge.  You think people would just give up using Internet 1.0 and use Internet 2.0 instead?
"there's a reason why US bonds have among the lowest interest rates in the world." and it is not because "Everyone trusts the US ability to repay their debts."  It is no secret the Fed has been backstopping the US government bond market where there are not enough buyers/interest to artificially keep the bond interest rate low.  Just a 1% increase in interest rate = $200 billion extra US government have to pay just in interest for the $20+ trillion debt.

Whenever someone is buying, somebody has to be selling.  The price doesn't go up (or down) much when the supply and demand are at equilibrium.  If Coinbase is somehow selling extra IOU bitcoins that will imply there is higher demand than supply so the price should be going up.  The fact it is not going up disproves your point (or baseless hypothesis).

I am not sure if you are just "dumbing" it down for your dad, but bitcoin (cash) doesn't actually leave your wallet and move to the merchant or receiving wallet.  "Wallets" doesn't actually hold any bitcoin.  Your wallet stores your private key to sign and create a transaction to let the bitcoin network know to transfer a certain amount of bitcoin from your account (matching public key) on the bitcoin ledger to the merchant's account (public key).

Who is this guy debating Peter Schiff?  He is Aweful!
When Peter said the only person who would be willing to buy my Bitcoin is somebody who believes he can also sell it to somebody else at a higher price and there's no other use for it.  Why did he not reply back.  People buy Bitcoin for remittance and to avoid capital control/oppressive government.  That's just the obvious/simple use cases.

Let me help OP correct his/her false statement, it should read: "The sad truth is, every bank investor/account holder is indirectly helping out criminals "  So I guess OP is telling us to withdraw all of our bank deposits and buy Bitcoin and other cryptos!

That's as ridiculous as saying Apple should change their name and re-brand because an Apple is just an apple right?  Before Apple Computer Inc. (now Apple Inc) came along, apple is just an apple, now Apple is one of the most valuable brand names in the world because of what the Apple company has done.  Blockchain Limited started back in 2011 before blockchain is all the rage now.  They make bitcoin/blockchain more accessible and easier to use for regular users and helped grew the user base with their web wallet and iOS/Android wallets.  They deserve to continue using Blockchain as their company name.

Oh the irony!  You are the one who is stuck playing rich people's game not buying bitcoin and holding on to your beloved "regulated" fiat currency.  Have you stop and ask yourself who "regulated"?  Who makes the regulations and are the regulators?  You think these are poor people?   You think they make regulations and regulate for the goods of poor people?  Haha... the joke is on you!
Bitcoin is the great equalizer for those individual and companies who will never have any chance of competing against rich people and companies by removing the power from the riches' bias fiat currency regulations.

Very true.  Deutsche Bank has almost 3x all of Central Bank balance sheet on its derivative book (close to $60 trillion).  And that's just one bank, now imagine how big that number is if we add up the top 50 banks in the world.  The amount of reckless leveraging is insane.

I sent 42 mBTC from my private wallet to my Abra account on my mobile phone and it showed I have around $100 in USD on June 2nd.
If the fund (regardless it is displayed as USD, BTC or other currency) is truly held client-side in my Abra bitcoin wallet on my mobile phone, why did my wallet lost 6 mBTC (~$17 USD) when I tried to change the Wallet Currency display from $ USD to BTC today (June 10th)? It is showing me I now only have 36 mBTC in my Abra wallet when I originally transferred 42 mBTC (already subtracted transaction fee)?
