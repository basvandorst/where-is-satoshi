You mean, nobody except for the protocol that prohibits more than 3 tps? 
Or are you saying we'll need more transactions on chain?


if transactions through LN nodes are banned, they can route through other LN nodes? Which have the same ban enforced by government? You mean, exactly like with banks?

Ban everything that can't be identified? How can you stop authorities from doing that?


I'm not sure it's a choice. LN nodes will tend to centralize due to costs.

Tor hubs can be easily prosecuted actually 
The only reason this doesn't happen more often is only because authorities don't care usually. 
Bittorrent is different because every user replicates the data downloaded. No single entity is responsible for the distribution of data. And Blockchain is like Bittorrent, all users share a big file. 
LN on the other hand is like Tor with its hubs which can become targets for government regulations if things get serious.

It seems a hub is not much different from a bank. Even if it can't practice fractional reserve, it can censor transactions and can require KYC/AML.

Their function is not the point. They are similar in the sense that they are distinguishable nodes that can be easily targeted.  


Let me put it this way. 
With LN you go through 20 doors consecutively, one after another. Every door in the sequence is important for your payment, bears responsibility for it, and will likely become an easily targeted hub. 
With Bittorrent and Blockchain you go through thousands doors simultaneously. A payment is processed by everyone and nobody at the same time. This is decentralization.


This is just a wishful thinking. What is your plan to prevent centralization? Users will naturally open channels with wallets and payment processors. Which will become just like banks except for fractional reserve.
