Was it... Worth it?

Wait are ongoing changes still being made to Bitcoin source code? Who has the authority to accept pull requests?
@_date: 2018-08-13 22:45:09
Why is it so big? How much data do you need to store a wallet address.

People definitely were trying to over throw the banking system in the first century ace. Jesus talks explicitly against the banking system in the Bible.

Bitcoin destabilizes the global economy and world war breaks out. \s

High quality post
@_date: 2018-06-15 22:10:26
Whoa dude, polymorphic.
@_date: 2018-06-27 00:10:05
I know. You beat one and you think. Great, now maybe I can relax instead of fucking around with this dumb game. Then it turns out there's another whole level.
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:20:39
Pretty hard to poop in your own mouth
@_date: 2018-06-02 15:55:38
This doesn't even make sense a lot of these neither hyperinflated, failed, or were fiat.

@_date: 2018-06-01 02:58:59
I hate this sub lol
@_date: 2019-02-24 15:00:59
How does that make any sense?
@_date: 2019-12-20 22:27:24
Yeah but you can get screwed for evading income tax.

I agree that mining definitely seems like a waste of resources, which is bad. But I'm not sure if a better solution yet exists if the goal is to create a decentralized digital currency. Even the articles you link to don't seem to imply so.
That being said I have no financial interest in Bitcoin, I'm just a math guy
@_date: 2018-03-19 06:31:51
Bitcoin people should realize the hodl thing hurts the value of the currency.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:20:09
So, the point of mining is to make it highly infeasible for a single person to manipulate the ledger. Without it there is nothing to stop anybody from lying about the current state of any given wallet. This is the point of a blockchain, which is the technological idea that allowed Bitcoin to start, what you're talking about is also a thing, but it requires a centralized ledger to work.
The 3 blue 1 brown video about blockchain is a great resource for an easy to understand, but technical explanation of how Bitcoin is able to work.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:21:29
Sure, what prevents somebody from double spending a coin?
@_date: 2018-11-15 01:14:41
The market in general is wayy down... It makes logical sense that Bitcoin is going to drop with it. Some people on this sub have some insane belief that Bitcoin is some sort of hedge bet against the USD when that could not be further from the truth.
@_date: 2018-11-06 02:43:02
You clearly don't remember 2008.
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:51:19
That is a great pizza though. Also w/ chicken.
@_date: 2018-07-14 00:20:21
Right if I flip a coin 10 times in a row and get heads every time that's a clear trend, but because a coin flip is an independent event guessing it will be heads again has no logical backing.
Similarly just because the winning teams have preformed poorly the following year doesn't have any bearing on whether the current winning team will do poorly this or next year.
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:23:10
Diversification is for noobs \s
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:49:54
You've never heard of independent events have you?
@_date: 2018-07-15 17:36:26
What about pcp? 
@_date: 2018-07-14 16:28:13
Disagree. It is pretty hard to buy staws though.

If the economy colapsased, you would do what everyone during any collapsing economy does. Exchange your assets and time for things that have utility. 
During the collapse of the German economy bread was worth more than gold. People used paper currency as firewood. If the dollar collapsed bitcoins would be utterly worthless because the common person would be preoccupied with finding food for their family. Beyond that, the collapsing of a major world economy doesn't make the speculative currency market look all too promising. 
This is independent of any opinions about Bitcoin, it simply isn't strong enough to in its current state survive a sudden collapse of the dollar. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 23:45:01
If the dollar collapsed the last thing anybody would be trying to buy is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:36:29
It just doesn't make any sense to make that bet. It's pointless and winning the million dollars doesn't mean anything to Warren, while losing costs him far more than that. The bets are just for publicity.
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:52:26
yeah I misinterpreted his response and read it as only a million BTC currently circulating. which is false. So unfortunately google does not work as a source
@_date: 2018-04-21 15:14:33
Upboating for high quality upboat.
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:23:13
No I'm saying he makes his bets generally to prove points to the public. So betting the S&amp;P will outperform hedge funds makes the point that paying for hedge funds is dumb. But betting Bitcoin will fail is pointless and can only potentially make him look like a poor market futurist.
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:05:13
Wait really? Shit. Source?
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:19:51
Not fiat if there's a gold standard.
@_date: 2018-04-26 15:19:07
Doesn't Satoshi have like 11,000,000 in his wallet? Are there really only 6 million circulating?
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:10:47
I don't know if I'm getting trolled or you're just way too into the bitcoin/buffet-bet side of this(?) or what... But please enjoy whatever opinions it is you seem to be trying to explain. Have a nice day! :)
Ugg I think you are being legit after rereading this so I'll line item it:
1) Buffet can never prove Bitcoin will fail, it either will or it won't
2) taking a publicity stunt bet to publicize an already well known occurrence makes no sense
3) winning that already pointless stunt earns you a negligible amount of money you risked at no potential gain
4) losing that bet costs you the value of the bet and the value your investment firm loses from shareholders because you took a bet, at no potential gain, for no valid reason, and we're wrong.
5) there is a 0% chance it would ever look bad for Warren -not- to make one of his bets against btc... You making this point (if it's legitimate) leads me to believe you need to really step back and see the forest not a tree. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 19:36:03
@_date: 2018-04-28 19:48:58
Yeah. I just think that the bet existing would seem to legitimize the coin. With his other bets he usually has a point to prove to the public where in this case his position is probably the coin will collapse so his point will prove itself.
@_date: 2018-04-28 19:38:19
Making the bet would increase odds of losing the bet. Where as in his index fund bet he helped his chances by talking negatively about hedge fund managers.
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:25:47
Wait? You're arguing against diversification; because one individual feels a particular way? That is insanely bad advice...
