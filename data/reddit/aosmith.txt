That's what I thought, is the memory pool limit still 366 hours?  Back when I was mining (I mined over 100 coins, wish I still had 'em) no fee tx's would go through in a couple hours.  Oh how things change.  Thanks!

The funniest thing I've been dealing with lately is friends that I sent $5-10 to to show them how it works.  Made at least a few thousand-aires.

ViaBTC has been full for the last couple days.  I just did the low priority fee in mycelium which came out to practically nothing ~3 sat/byte.

Isn't the 8 connection limit hardcoded?

I've often found that people will quickly change their tune if you're giving away a little coin to demonstrate how everything works.  I've done this with execs from a few (very) large banks in the past and that got their attention in a hurry.

I'm not an accountant or an attorney so take this with a grain of salt.
Right now bitcoins are taxed as an asset when you receive them, just as if you had been paid in say, butter or gold.  The capital gains is triggered when you exchange them for anything (cash, food, whatever) and is based on the change in value of the coins over the time that you held them.  Hope that helps!
@_date: 2014-12-16 06:33:52
Wait is this about mastercoin?  why is this on @_date: 2014-12-18 06:40:03
It's from 1973, so you're probably correct... But converting it into copper is illegal.

They're a private company and the chairman of the fed makes more money than any other official person.  Isn't this the point of BTC to begin with?
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:07:56
No BTC, this is what OP is talking about...
@_date: 2014-10-27 05:08:18
Why is anyone complaining about empty blocks?  Block rewards still outweigh transaction fees by an order of magnitude.
Aside: Granted empty blocks are bad for bitcoin in general.

Yea I wrote something like this about a year ago when it actually worked... Sadly the best (safe) arb was CampBX to Coinbase and that involved buying a bunch of postal money orders.

Bitcoin exchange operator? :p
@_date: 2014-12-18 22:18:58
Or a commodity... I'm with you.  What do you think of bitreserve?
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:00:54
You're correct.  But what you're not realizing is that miners cannot afford to simply sit on all of these coins.  There are real expenses that must be paid (rent, electricity, power supplies) so a fair portion of these coins have probably been converted to cover expenses that cannot be paid with bitcoin.  
For example running a KNC Neptune for a month generates about 1BTC right now but will use about $150 worth of electricity (assumes 2.1KW, $0.10/kwh, and 3TH/s).
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:05:29
I had something similar happen to me as a child.  Kids should be graded on quality not content, and your son did well on both!

Yea but what... 100nm+ shut off long ago and 54nm is still mildly profitable depending on your energy rates.
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:53:27
That's generally a miners fee / transaction fee.  I think he's talking about an amount that's smaller than a single satoshi which is almost certainly a floating point error.
@_date: 2014-09-28 07:05:26
I think your patient may have posted as well... 
@_date: 2014-10-27 06:11:45
Makes sense, selective processing is bad news but it's also about to start happening on a major scale.  If retailers like 7-11 start accepting btc they will be willing to pay for having their transactions processed by miners at a higher rate than others.
Your point is entirely correct.

These apps are all a little scary -- We have no idea what's going on inside a compiled binary.  I'm lucky to still have my blockchain.info wallet -- as for the rest of these I wouldn't trust them with any significant amount of money.

That's going to snowball into an SEC violation sooner or later.  I am sure people bought paycoin based on that information.
@_date: 2015-01-02 00:29:54
Bernie Madoff was everywhere before his empire imploded.  I think GAW is more or less paying press / media outlets to write positive stories and doing their best to sensor anything negative.
Paybase has also already had a breach... Not good for anything so new.
If any of that is accurate I expect the SEC / RICO charges to be very entertaining.

@_date: 2015-03-29 19:01:58
You won't, you can modify the source to allow more connections.  The line you need to modify is in net.cpp:
static const int MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS = 8;
I've done this in the past, compiled and gotten up to ~1k connections.  This is generally bad for the btc community because it's a form of centralization.
