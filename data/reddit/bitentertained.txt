True, but gold would still be limited to what exists here on earth, and so it would be scarce. Once we start mining space, one asteroid could drastically change the amount of gold in circulation.

Man, I see in *bitcoin* the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.

This defeats the purpose of bitcoin and being your own bank. 
Sure some people might but I think after the next financial crisis people will start to think a little different about money. 


Personally I think any system that engages in fractional reserves will eventually be called on it by a bank run that it can not contain. This may effect the short term price of bitcoin but will not effect bitcoin in the long run as the market will grow stronger from some services failing. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 20:04:32
I understand what your saying and it is very true. It however is not impossible to move up and if one is determined and has educated themselves on how the system works it can be done. I know most of the poor don't travel or move as often in search for opportunities elsewhere but that doesn't mean they can't. I understand we have a class problem but by encouraging those at the bottom not to work, or by setting price floors, this encourages dependency which definitely doesn't help people move up. 
I guess I should rephrase to, people are paid what they are worth, which is related to their productivity. Worth would also include education and experience so that is why some people with the same level of productivity would be paid differently. Better?

I am glad we understand each other. Yes it would be more beneficial to work with the regulators as much as possible, to ensure the minimal amount of regulation but my stance is that they already have all the tools and regulations they need. They just need to apply them to bitcoin, either as a commodity or as a currency. 
This new system is an independent monetary system that can compliment the existing system if the existing system doesn't fight it. It is simply a new medium of exchange and should be regulated like any other. The only focus I see congress working on in respect to bitcoin regulation however is how can the guarantee the taxes on it will be paid, and the simple answer is they can't.

A lot of bitcoiners believe we should incorporate some sort of anonymity by default. For example Andreas Antonopoulos, one of the most notable advocates in the space regularly talks about how not being anonymous by default is one of his biggest problems with the bitcoin protocol. Now that Darkcoin has proven how to do it successfully, I think bitcoin may eventually implement such a feature.

That is true, if your a bank use your own profits or money to lend. not what people deposit. This is why we made a distinction between commercial banks and investment banks with glass-steagall and a big reason for the financial mess we are in is because we repealed it. It is not the same thing if you lend the gold out yourself. You are taking a chance/gambling that it will be payed back. When a bank does it they are betting with other peoples money.

It will be more than currency but that is what it is used as. For the average joe it will be a secure way to purchase on the internet without giving away personal information or high fees unlike credit cards that ask for 3% and require almost all of your personal information to be trusted to the merchant that can be hacked at a later date, examples sony and target. Not to mention the store of value it provides is light years ahead of any other currency. Gyft is a band-aid until we have wider merchant adoption, and even merchant adoption is a stepping stone to a closed circuit bitcoin economy where everything from the funding of a company, to the paying of expenses, to the purchasing of goods or getting paid in bitcoin becomes a reality. 
Bitcoin the network and protocol is open source IP.
However bitcoins the currency/commodity will need to be regulated as one to inspire more industrial and establishment adoption if they wish to save anything from the old system. Otherwise they will be replaced.
I think this adoption will happen with or without the consent of regulators from Washington. As companies such as overstock and dish start working with bitcoins it will force competitors to also investigate and adopt or they will cede part of an incredibly fast growing market. 
With the news today that apple may consider allowing bitcoin apps I think we are on the verge of mainstream adoption and this is without any clear precedent. If Apple the largest company in the world acknowledges bitcoins, I can think of no greater event that would signify mainstream adoption besides the possibility of a country converting it's national currency to it. 
With respect to regulations like i said I think they already have all the regulations they need. All regulators need to do is say bitcoins will be regulated at the exchange and broker level. The can't regulate bitcoin transactions much better than they could regulate cash transactions. It really is cash for the internet, or a digital commodity or a bit of both. Regulators need to take an approach similar to how they handled the internet, which is to say as little as possible to none.

@_date: 2014-06-02 13:30:49
It is only unstable AFTER we have reached a saturated market. Because bitcoin is a new disruptive technology the growth will continue to be exponential untill it absorbes all less competent competition in its market. So far that includes western union, money gram and other remittances services. I also think it will go on to challenge the entire financial services industry such as big banks, credit card companies, and eventually world reserve currency. So I think we have a long way to go before we see the top of this s curve.

Excellent article, but I for one will chose to board the spaceship and escape to mars. Distributed autonomous open source corporations do give privacy to the individual and transparency to the powerful. Also, it isn't magic that makes services appear, it is profit or moral incentives. This is why private charities are better than government redistribution policies, and private orphanages are usually better than the public adoption system. It isn't magic, its chaos theory and it works.

Bitcoin doesn't fit into the current economic system. It is creating a new one. There are ways for the current system to change and adapt to take full use of bitcoin, but in my opinion that means as little interference as possible. Declare that it won't be arbitrary made illegal. Set the tax rules, set the exchange regulations and see what happens. The government doesn't create innovation, the best it can do is get out of innovations way, well unless they want to convert from US$ to bitcoins, that would be the best case scenario but we can all agree that won't happen. 
The possibilities in the short term is a complete overhaul of the remittances market and after that the rest of the financial services industry. Will this require regulation? Yes. However the more regulation that is added the more innovation you will drive offshore. Do we want enough regulation to drive scams and fractional reserve exchanges offshore? Definitely. However it needs to be done in a manor that won't stifle new exchanges from coming online. Historically congress has a tenancy to favor big corporations instead of an equal playing field, so I say get out of the way. Bitcoin came this far without any help from congress and it can go much further if it isn't regulated by those who may not understand it.

Gold is great but we are on the verge of mining in space. Maybe not this decade but I expect it to happen before 2030.

Ok first, mining is the process where a computer process transactions for the bitcoin network. 
Cloud mining refers to paying a company to mine bitcoin for you on the serves they host. 
I advise you to do at least a week of researching all the different alternatives before making any decision. 
For example you could invest in PETA mine on HavelockInvestments which offers 15/gh per share, much cheaper than cex.io and it has a business plan to keep expanding the gh per share through reinvesting 50% of the coins mined into new hardware. Where some mining plans run out in 12 months you will still own the share in this company if it continues to operate. With all investments in bitcoin there are very large risks and you might be better off just hording bitcoin.

A better strategy would be to look at the markets bitcoin will be disrupting and short them because the losers will be much easier to spot than the winners. For example remittances I would short. I would not suggest trying to pick out companies that will benefit from bitcoin due to the disruptive nature this makes it unpredictable.  For example overstock got some press and maybe a tiny boost in sales but this doesn't show me that they are going to profit enough off of just accepting bitcoin to validate an investment off that premise. If you go long on anything, it is bitcoin.

Best case, they regulate and tax the exchange of bitcoins just like any other currency. A little bit worse would be to regulate it like a currency and tax it like a commodity which is what they have purposed already. However they will only be able to regulate services provided for bitcoin that operate in the united states, not bitcoin itself. With the way bitcoin operates however, this is all purely optional for those holding or using bitcoins. They could chose to use unregulated services outside the sates and they could chose to forget they bought bitcoin and not pay gains taxes on it and there is nothing regulators could do about it.

It is at least 2 decades away unless precious metals prices explode raising the incentive. Current prices for some precious metals are drastically undervalued right now but yes, if you mined an asteroid that had 4,000 times the amount of gold than what has been mined on earth I think that would have a significant impact on prices. It just so happens astronomers believe that amount can be found in an asteroid that is currently orbiting the sun.

Yes 99% of the money supply in modern society is debt.
No we don't need to restrict lending in bitcoin.
People who do invest bitcoins are best off if they purchase the bitcoins when they invest them because bitcoins will most likely out perform most companies. This is mostly about improving the bitcoin ecosystem and hopefully getting reliable dividends if the company succeeds. These investments help the bitcoin network grow and in turn bitcoins value grows. 
The bitcoin community wants a divorce from dollars and it is working hard to close the loop so we can buy goods and services in bitcoin - the merchant can pay for the goods and services in bitcoin - the producers can pay workers and expenses in bitcoin - then the worker can buy what he needs with bitcoin. Companies have recently been able to start getting funding in bitcoin and although this is usually at a loss for investors, like I said it helps make the entire network more valuable.

I think $4,400 is the minimum for this bubble. I am hoping to see closer to $10k, especially with what is going on in the markets right now. The US$ is being propped up by someone using Belgium as a front. Eurasia has signed gas deals without the USD so the petro$ is dead in the water. Demands for gold audits and huge buying from the east. Banks are bigger than ever taking even bigger risks than in 2008. Not to mention a huge credit implosion is about to go off in china. But lets pretend that is all **ok**. Bitcoin is still the fastest, easiest and cheapest way to securely send money globally. Remittances is a $500,000,000,000 market.

That is why businesses are rightfully skeptical but as time passes and more and more businesses make the jump to bitcoin that variance decreases.

I understand that a loan increases the perceived money supply if the metric counts loans or debt as equal to real bitcoin but that does not increase the supply of actual bitcoins is my point.

It is up to each individual to decide what is just for them personally. To me, that doesn't justify 50% of what I earn. The tax and fiat money system at work in the united states more closely represents slavery than anything I would deem just.

Bitcoin has no legal concerns. The law can not regulate bitcoin, it could try to regulate around it but that is the equivalent of putting up a fence on a sidewalk and asking everyone not to walk around it. Someone help me out and post the meme.

The remittances market alone is close to $500,000,000,000 globally. Bitcoin can take all of that as it is right now with no further updates. Then beyond remittances the black market, gambling, porn and long term investments will all probably move toward bitcoin. After that bitcoin could challenge national currencies and establish itself as the new world reserve currency. With bitcoin the sky is not its limit.

Look at what bitfinex is doing with bitcoin loans, I am sure with the announcement of the Great American Insurance Company working with bitcoin today that reversible transaction insurance is on the way. Untill now bitcoin most likely wasn't big enough to justify the required capital to start such a program.

All valid concerns, especially hedges manipulating the exchanges but because they would have to buy bitcoins to sell them I think it is a zero sum game unlike the paper gold market where they can issue more papergold than gold exists. Basically an exchange would have to allow fake bitcoin and I am not sure that is likely.  With bitcoin though the main concern is the store of value for the network over the ability for entities to lend bitcoin out.

@_date: 2014-06-03 05:16:03
I see your point, but because bitcoin's price is inflationary unlike fiat, this discourages lending to some degree. I suppose time will tell how the system evolves from here but I see how your concerns could be valid in the future if we allow banks to get away with the same shenanigans that they are using today. Because bitcoin allows people to be their own bank I don't think we will have mega corporations devaluing it on the open market the same way they do with the US$

Why would we mine the asteroid? it would be cheaper to push it into our orbit or knock it into the ocean than it would be to mine it in space. This isn't Armageddon, we aren't talking about sending a drill team to land on an asteroid. A robot could easily attach an engine to an asteroid and then it is just a matter of mathematics/timing to bring it back to earth.

Ok I see what your saying and I can agree with most of it. I think we in the USA are more dependant on china than you give us credit for, china will do what it can to contain the meltdown but the 'recovery' in the us is mostly from number manipulation and accounting tricks, so any systemic problem out of china will effect all western economies and it will be more than enough to hit that first domino. When that happens, china seems to be prepared for it so they will survive it much better than the ignorant westerners that have been brainwashed by mainstream propoganda.

They pay them a million because if they didn't they could get paid that or a little less by another company. I *highly* doubt it. People are paid what they are worth, and that includes negotiating the pay. No one is born with a sticker on the head that says "Your a 1% and will always be paid millions." They earn that valuation, through education and experience and it is determined by the free market.

Yes but they are under paid because of market conditions like you said. Its always in the interest of an employer to minimize costs, its also in their interest to incentivize good workers to stay with raises. Unless the task is entry level. The production and productivity could be worth more in a more free market but in the one we have to work in the work force is saturated and the value of that work is diminished by so many competing for so few jobs. From my experience you have to start with minimizing costs, then you work on maximizing value in those employees you deem worth the extra expense.

Bitcoin does need to grow gradually, and it is. Just because the price follows an exponential curve does not mean it is growing too fast. If you look at a logarithmic chart bitcoins growth has been pretty stable.

This is one of the main reasons that we haven't seen a major push for this already, however I think whoever is first to accomplish this task will single handedly monopolize a precious metals market and that would be worth almost any cost.

Fractional reserve banking is when you lend out more than you have. If you only lend what you have that is not fractional at all. You are assuming risk and that is why you will be payed interest. Some organizations may consider the loan as good as bitcoin but that doesn't make it bitcoin until it is payed back.

Altcoins will have different purposes such as curecoin and gridcoin for research advancement.

I see your Wilson and raise you.
The very word "secrecy" is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control. And no official of my Administration, whether his rank is high or low, civilian or military, should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know.
