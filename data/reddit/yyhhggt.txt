A fool and his money
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:48:03
At least Tulip is backed by something!
@_date: 2014-03-24 02:25:14
That's exactly why they pay interest :)
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:56:19
But with the Federal Reserve Magic Notes, it's no longer a zero sum game. Here, watch as I print out another trillion and give them to my rich buddies!
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:50:58
That's the joke.
@_date: 2014-02-18 13:47:18
He needs to work on his grammar!!!
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:30:34
Well, it must be even better now at $600!
@_date: 2013-05-04 02:16:45
Like my investment in Nortel stock
@_date: 2013-07-05 23:34:08
My point was nothing can grow exponentially forever.
@_date: 2013-07-03 22:48:24
The end of freedom.
@_date: 2013-07-04 06:15:14
Time to sell.

The pogs bubble of 1994. It ceased to exist after the ban.
@_date: 2013-09-15 23:26:23
Look on the bright side, the manufacturer made a bundle off of you!
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:53:01
@_date: 2013-07-05 19:08:13
and then it's gone :)
@_date: 2013-09-25 18:20:09
In 7 days difficulty will be 200M, then 260m, then 340m.
@_date: 2013-05-06 23:31:37
And then everyone goes to jail. It's the drug wars all over again. Have bitcoin in your possession? off to jail you go. 
@_date: 2013-07-05 19:06:28
The only thing that grows exponentially forever is cancer.
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:33:54
You asked a question :P
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:57:08
Contact your bank or credit card company to reverse the transaction.
@_date: 2013-06-18 00:58:35
I recommend a class action lawsuit to recover what is rightfully yours.
@_date: 2013-05-04 01:18:26
After it becomes a problem. See the pog bubble.
@_date: 2013-07-03 05:12:54
That's a lot of difficulties coming up.
@_date: 2013-06-29 02:31:56
1. To have bitcoins.
2. None at this time.
3. Not at this time.
@_date: 2013-05-05 00:39:46
More reason for Bitcoin to get banned in the Western bloc.
@_date: 2013-05-04 22:40:26
Flood of the ASIC and the Chinese 51% majority.
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:46:53
Supply and demand
@_date: 2013-10-20 20:41:37
Are you saying mining is money laundering?
@_date: 2013-09-25 18:21:29
Which means people won't be using it. Only speculators.
@_date: 2013-07-05 18:12:31
Contact your bank to reverse the transaction. /s
@_date: 2013-06-02 16:57:37
Supply and demand.
@_date: 2013-06-15 03:56:37
Yeah and they don't have a computer either.
@_date: 2013-07-12 04:43:47
So why did they changed their mind?
@_date: 2013-05-02 00:22:31
You want litecoin instead.
@_date: 2013-07-03 16:25:49
Time to sell.
@_date: 2013-06-03 00:27:53
Give me your money, I'll give you bitcoins in return.
@_date: 2013-07-05 03:19:49
It's like the net censorship in China. They do the same thing.
@_date: 2013-05-04 01:19:15
Contact the FDIC for your taxpayer deposit insurance to cover it.
@_date: 2013-05-04 03:30:18
Illegal activities.
