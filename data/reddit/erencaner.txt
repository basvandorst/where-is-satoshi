When I transfer it, it says 7 usd for fee, I've set it up for 4.34 usd. This is all I did. Will it be confirmed today?

I transferred it from blockchain.info wallet to another blockchain.info wallet. So in my new address, I can see the balance without confirmation. Can I send it again without any confirmation? So how many days does it need to confirm it estimated?
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:39:40
I don't understand you clearly. So do you mean, probably it will be confirmed today?

For lightning network;
What are the differences between connection weak node or strong node for this time and for the future?
weak node means: nodes which have less nodes.
strong node means: nodes which have many nodes.
which one is better?
