We don't need a Bitcoin foundation. Bitcoin is doing just fine.

is there a pin for this wallet? ...otherwise anyone can empty my money.

Can you make bitcoin plugin for merchants selling online that accomplishes the following:
1: generates a new
Bitcoin address for each purchase 
2: bitcoins are sent directly to the merchants Bitcoin wallet
3:sends a notification that a purchase was made on their online store
4: allows consumer to select a variety of options. For example select what size in pant you want.
5: automatically add shipping / % in taxes
@_date: 2015-06-11 16:01:03
I'm not promoting any companies here. I saw the announcement same time everyone else did and put in my old address (I lived there a big chunk of my life). I didn't know florida is banned for bitcoin services.
@_date: 2015-06-17 03:06:22
enjoy! ;)
@_date: 2015-06-11 19:35:03
Starting to think there is no such thing. An imaginary place that people claim exist.
@_date: 2015-12-24 22:49:08
yes you will be in a large amount of trouble. Send all your bitcoins to me immediately.
@_date: 2015-06-26 05:47:24
In the case of circle and coinbase I would think so because of kyc policies.
@_date: 2015-06-11 16:24:53
THEY LOCKED ME OUT OF ALL MY MONEY.
@_date: 2015-12-26 21:22:01
Currently I'm using mycelium to for my online store but it's basic.
I need my users to select size and color and it needs to calculate the shipping and tax.
Does this plugin have these functions?
@_date: 2015-06-11 21:24:55
That's what I did. I'm waiting now.
@_date: 2015-12-15 18:09:51
Check if Libertyx operates in Canada they allow you to purchase without Id.
@_date: 2015-12-24 07:42:54
strongly agree with you.

@_date: 2015-06-09 21:17:26
We don't need an organization like the bit foundation. The bitcoin movement is doing just fine.
@_date: 2015-12-05 02:02:51
For a website. I  want to know if I can set up my online store with with bitcoin and generate new addresses for each user. No conversion to fiat.

@_date: 2015-06-11 19:42:40
I disagree. They should be upfront about this. They aren't direct about this. They don't say if you have an account and you decide to verify it just know there is a possibility that we will lock you out of your account.
I don't even know how I was able to register if my state was a problem in the first place. They should have on the registration page as I'm filling it out the states that are not serviced. Is that not a logical way to go about it? I have to dig around for something I was not aware of in the first place? They send me to that page after they lock me out?
@_date: 2015-12-12 19:25:07
to ban bitcoin they would have to ban the internet. Good luck with that though.
@_date: 2015-06-11 19:12:36
I did. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 13:56:22
Dude take it from me. I got screwed when bitreserve froze my account. 
I'm strictly using wallets on my phone and laptop. It's not worth leaving it to third parties. 
Bitcoin is special for allowing individuals to hold their own funds.
@_date: 2015-06-17 02:54:19
Hoping this will be bitcoin's new price average.
@_date: 2015-06-11 19:51:08
Nope it's not my fault.
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:26:10
Write down your backup seed/ backup phrase!
Mycelium / breadwallet have backup phrases if you lose your phone, tablet or comp you can always get your bitcoins back.
@_date: 2015-06-11 17:35:04
when can I expect login and withdraw my funds from bitreserve?
@_date: 2015-12-02 19:51:23
I want one sooooo bad!
@_date: 2015-06-03 10:09:45
If I had to guess. It's probably all this uncertainty with the 20mb block size debate.

@_date: 2015-06-11 16:07:27
I don't understand how bitcoin is going to make it when companies start banning entire states. I get what happened in New York but this is Florida. What is going on in Florida politically that I can't use bitreserve! 
@_date: 2015-06-15 21:35:48
went to the site but I don't see any option to pay in bitcoin. I also checked the mobile.
@_date: 2015-06-12 22:27:26
yeah you can download the page and image and swap it with your new design. make sure the image has the same name.

I think that is a VERY good comparison. I haven't been keeping up with it so I'm not sure what Goldman Sachs has to gain from Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-22 04:39:00
She would need to send her bitpesos to a bitcoin exchange to convert to real physical pesos in her bank account.
Bitpesos is just hedge against bitcoins volatility. 
Bitreserve does not send fiat money only the equivalent of that value as bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-15 16:01:57
Thanks for responding so quickly. It sent out now finally I'm just not sure why it wouldn't the last 5 attempts. weird.
@_date: 2015-12-24 07:18:38
As much as I love gold and silver....the problem is you can't even hide it in your butt...lol. Leaving with your gold or silver is near impossible. This is why I see bitcoin's price going past $1000. I can go to any country without anyone knowing I have them. I can send and receive payment under the radar. There is war on people. As fiat currencies crash and economies fail, the state will set it's cross hairs on property and money.

I didn't wait 10mins I waited 10 minutes after they were sent. 
The qr code expired before hand  and its behaving like I didn't send $35 at all.

@_date: 2016-06-06 14:32:01
lol. am I hurting your feelings about bitcoin? I guess its working. I only rant when I run into bitcoin problems which appears to be quite frequently. I can't see how the community will handle this with new users.
all you need is one tx failure, one account closure to turn the masses off. I'll keep bitching until the problems are resolved buddy.
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:39:49
So what else could it be? I buy to hold or to buy things on purse.
I make one big purchase and they closed my account immediately? what other explanation is there?
@_date: 2016-06-06 15:57:19
I posted an update at the the top but lets say that's true...that makes bitcoin purchased thru exchanges pointless. It means you're incriminated whether the coins are yours or not.
@_date: 2016-06-06 13:20:50
I tried calling them but its too early. I have to wait until my lunch break.
@_date: 2016-06-06 13:10:10
no. you are saying its me. I'm automatically a criminal here unless I divulge everything I planned to buy in this Orwellian country.
I was trying to buy some fucking silver from JM Bullion. $100 of silver as a gift to my gf. because 1# - she likes silver and 2# because I can only buy $100 minimum on their site with bitcoin. 
no privacy at all. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:32:45
I guess any purchase over $100 is deemed illegal or something but hey the first guy to comment is claiming he bought $2400 so I don't know what the fuck to believe.
@_date: 2016-06-06 15:10:16
so get this. It turns out that the card they had on file was not my recent card. I just called them now but I wouldn't have known that since they automatically closed my account. you have to admit that is extreme response over an expired card. usually they just tell you to update it. Now I have to wait a day or 2 to get my account back.
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:47:34
look. I just want to buy bitcoins. I'm not using it for anything other than hoarding or buying items on purse.
I can't help but feel like I'm being dismissed as a criminal for simply  trying to get bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-06-06 15:11:18
they never took $110 in the first place. I was bitching about them closing my account.
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:24:11
I'm a casual user. This was my biggest purchase I believe. I either keep my bitcoins or I use it to buy things on purse. I just wanted to buy a birthday gift. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 14:18:41
if jm bullion was accepting dash I would use my stash but believe what you want.
@_date: 2016-06-06 13:25:03
I'm not mad at you just this situation that this forum pretends does not exist. It's frustrating. I was a hardcore bitcoin fan, I thought it was  way out of the banking system but ironically my bitcoins or future bitcoins are being used against me and bar access to bitcoin. The system is creating a bottle neck making it harder to buy it.
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:16:58
I'm not sure how that helps me. I guess my problem doesn't exist if your purchase goes through?
@_date: 2016-06-06 15:10:18
so get this. It turns out that the card they had on file was not my recent card. I just called them now but I wouldn't have known that since they automatically closed my account. you have to admit that is extreme response over an expired card. usually they just tell you to update it. Now I have to wait a day or 2 to get my account back.
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:18:49
honestly I'm starting to realize coinbase and circle is going to seriously hurt bitcoin with these policies. I'm not recommending them.
@_date: 2016-06-06 14:42:58
i want bitcoin to succeed but now I'm wondering if it will ever live up to it original goal, private digital cash. Its not instant, txs fail or take too long, bitcoins are not fungible and exchanges are quick to close accounts from simply buying it.
Just look into my long history of my bitcoin problems. I'm convinced dash is a better option but I keep hoping in the back my mind that bitcoin overcomes these obstacles because right now bitcoin is simply enjoying first mover advantage and word of mouth.
When people start ACTUALLY using it and have the same problems I had they will abandon it and that's a shame. We need a crypto revolution.
@_date: 2016-06-06 15:19:09
fine I accept its my fault. Can you accept the circle response is obtuse?
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:07:56
She had me at bitcoin. Be my girlfriend!

BACK IT UP. BACK IT UP. BACK IT UP!
If you're buying crpyto currencies like bitcoin. You're first thought should be to BACKUP the wallet first before using it.
breadwallet looks good...BACK IT UP.
Maybe I'll use a desktop wallet...BACK IT UP.
I'll try another mobile wallet...BACK IT UP.
Is this getting annoying? THEN BACK IT UP!
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:03:45
It should be a central banker trying to sell you fiat currency and looking shady.
@_date: 2016-06-06 15:27:10
I did that already dude.
@_date: 2015-08-09 15:11:02
When they say it's not a safe haven anymore....it's definitely a safe haven. Buy more when it's cheap.
@_date: 2015-08-28 15:29:59
Don't get me wrong. The design is great. Big improvement for sure but let's move away from the physical bitcoin.
This causes a lot of confusion with new comers. It's counter productive to teach them about digital money and the first image they see on the page is a physical coin.
That aside I love it. Way more professional.
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:49:07
it's fun watching the behind the scenes development. Looking forward to your companies success. Love your product, I bought a ledger wallet from you personally at the bitcoin conference in miami and it works great. Great job.
@_date: 2015-07-03 19:54:09
I use multiple wallets. how do you do it on breadwallet?
@_date: 2019-02-08 16:41:42
No but it’s different! It wetter than previously thought!
@_date: 2015-07-05 03:18:44
send us an after photo! ;)
@_date: 2015-07-11 03:18:19
If it breaks 300 it will fall again from the selling pressure. I'm personally ok with that. The cheaper bitcoin is the more I can acquire. 
@_date: 2015-07-03 18:34:45
I did but they wanted to make sure I was the legitimate owner. I'm ok with it.
@_date: 2015-07-02 05:08:45
So if you make a transaction your basically verifying you're the one paying for it. I could totally see how this can be used against you.
@_date: 2015-07-29 03:25:58
The same way hitler didn't kill any Jews.

@_date: 2015-07-04 14:40:13

which means I can buy bitcoins cheaper! Can't wait!
@_date: 2015-07-04 15:22:37
I feel so sorry for the man. If we can get this guy to the I would be happy to send him some bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:13:21
YO they are using my design! I'm sending this guy 2 bucks. This is sooo exciting!
@_date: 2015-07-28 01:28:56
bitgold sounds like a good idea at first but it's going a step backwards.
Bitgold is a cryptocurrency backed by gold but...as much as I like gold as a true storage of value and sound money...Bitcoin takes it to the next level.
points against Bitgold:
1-we have to trust a third party that they actually have the gold it claims it has.
2-What if the government decided for it's own self interest to confiscate the gold. Wouldn't that make Bitgold worthless?
Points for Bitcoin:
1- Bitcoin is backed by math. Bitcoin doesn't need to be propped up by gold. Bitcoin's technology gives it value.
2 -Bitcoin works under the government's radar. It's not as easy to confiscate bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-07-05 23:28:37

It's a brochure site. Simple informational website, I'm sorry to hear that.
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:03:01
That's great for you but that doesn't mean Bitcoin is working great.
@_date: 2016-09-12 17:52:34
Just finished watching it. It was a great presentation. I think  you made it clear to the audience what bitcoin ultimately does. Remove financial gatekeepers.
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:34:33
Hodl the hips!
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:05:06
i wonder how much i can send before they confiscate the crypto for additional info. a little suspicious.
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:30:59
yes i did. the update for some reason hides the payments you have stored. you can't select the payment on ios. 
@_date: 2015-04-12 16:39:19
just to make it clear. Bitreserve only allows you to deposit bitcoin in other currencies. 
You don't own any of those currencies. it's simply to protect the value of your bitcoins.
Sending with any currency on bitreserve means you send a certain amount of bitcoins based on the value of the currency you're holding in.
so for example if you want to send someone $233 with the USD card, Bitreserve will send that amount of bitcoins (which is currently around 1 btc)
you still have to find someone that accepts bitcoin to use bitreserve.
Does that make sense? 
@_date: 2015-04-22 01:27:44
@_date: 2015-04-12 17:08:58
correct. you're parking your bitcoin's value. You don't own the gold.
@_date: 2015-09-14 04:21:16
I would suggest using bitreserve. So every time you purchase bitcoin send to bitreserve on a stable currency of your choosing.
Many would advise against that since your using them as a bank but it's up to you. Pick your poison.
@_date: 2015-04-03 17:32:48
back up your seed.
@_date: 2015-09-08 19:32:47
yeah I agree. They should use bitcoin on their smart phones. 
bread wallet (iphone)
mycelium (android)
of course they should be educated on their backup phrase and the importance of having the backup phrase written down before accepting bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-09-12 05:43:55
there is not altcoin wallet. You have to supply an altcoin deposit address for shapeshift to send altcoins to.

you would scan the bitcoin qr code with your smart phone and send $500 then walk out with your brand new tv.
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:58:02
if they can break through your phone's pin and the app's pin then yeah.
@_date: 2017-05-15 19:46:39
All I see is bitcoin at $200 discount. Buying some now.
@_date: 2015-11-05 07:53:41
lol. It's already happening under their noses and he knows it. Banks will lose to the greatest innovation since the internet.
@_date: 2015-11-05 00:19:36
yes. It's actually a good idea to put certain amount of USD so you can take advantage when the prices drops. When the price drops just send the amount in dollars you want to acquire in bitcoin. You and I have the same thought process.
@_date: 2015-03-24 22:15:28
The app at some point today Nikki stop displaying the pin code display. 
So I had to use the chrome app. But now somehow I don't have 2fa on my phone and I can't login to the chrome app.
I had 2fa on my phone but now I don't and I need 2fa to access my wallet.
So now I'm in a real bind.
@_date: 2015-03-24 21:50:58
he is currently trying to help me. taking much longer than expected.
@_date: 2015-03-11 22:20:36
maybe so but right now bitcoin companies need to do everything in their power to show the benefits of bitcoin. Not the downsides of acquiring them. 
We won't get mass adoption if we have a growing trend of cancelled purchases of bitcoin. He is a first time user. nothing suspicious was done. just bought $50 of bitcoin.
that shouldn't be a problem now, not while we're gaining traction.

I understand. To make the flow easier download a bitcoin wallet. Once your ready to send x amount of dollars from circle  it will automatically be sent to as bitcoins to your Bitcoin wallet.
If you want to take advantage of the rising value of bitcoins send them back to your usd circle wallet just remember to switch the wallet to usd.
Make sure it's a reliable Bitcoin wallet like mycelium or breadwallet.
Just to be clear you will need to use circle along with a separate bitcoin wallet.
That is how I'm currently doing it.

If you take secure measures you should be fine.

nevermind I see it.

I downloaded it but I don't see the option to pay in bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-05 02:02:02
rules written on a piece of paper has no affect on bitcoin.

lol...I can't access my wallet. Doesn't ask me for a pin now it just asks me to pair my device or signup.
not sure what you mean by pair up my device it doesn't really walk me through it.
I have all my 3 keys but don't know where to go from here. luckily I'm paranoid with new bitcoin apps. 
Only a few cents in there for testing. So how do I access my wallet? Please be detailed.
(update: how do you release this wallet without proper testing?! I can't exit authenticator on chrome and I can't access the mobile wallet either. Since everything is disabled in authenticator mode I can't do anything else. I can't scan the QR code because I get an error due to the fact that my mobile app is already paired up.)
Basically both chrome and mobile app is affectively UNUSABLE.

thanks. This should go towards my supervisor. I hope he will give bitcoin another try.

Thought I was the only one. Been waiting since 9:30am to receive mine.

from what I understand, a seed is just your private key in an easier format?
They both give access to your funds but the seed makes it easier for the user to backup and pull up from bitcoin wallets that support it.

It's too late. The government can't stop this.

I don't see this option on my iphone 5c. Is it not available for my iphone? I updated it.
@_date: 2015-02-12 21:56:06
OMG soooo excited. I've been wanting to code something bitcoin related. I'm familiar with javascript so I would love to play around with it.
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:13:11
and you get a bitcoin and you get a bitcoin! EVERYONE.. GETS..BITCOINS!!!
@_date: 2015-02-10 22:17:33
:/  I have two change tip accounts. send me your address.
@_date: 2015-03-11 22:08:11
ridiculous. I felt like a complete idiot for recommending coinbase.
@_date: 2015-02-13 01:09:48
I'm also stuck at install. not sure how to install it.
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:08:21
I totally agree with this review. Too many keys to write down. I would have been ok with the seed and mobile pin but 3 keys to write down? It's overkill. I don't know what the validation key is for.
I prefer the send and receive buttons stacked so they display at their widest. Interface feels small on my iPhone 5c. 
I like the look but some things need to be rethought. I use mycelium and bread wallet at the moment.

BEFORE ACCEPTING ANY BITCOINS.
You need to write down your backup passphrase.
So if you lose your app, phone or w/e. You can always access your bitcoin balance. This can't be stressed enough.
@_date: 2015-02-23 22:17:33
just know if you download a bitcoin wallet to your phone to WRITE DOWN THE RANDOM PHRASE (even before acquiring any bitcoins.). That way if you lose your phone, drop it in water or have some other phone disaster. You're safe. As long as you can input your phrase you will always have your bitcoins. Sleep peacefully knowing you have your backup.
