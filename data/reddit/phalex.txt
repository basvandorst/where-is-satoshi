All miners are also nodes though, they need a full copy of the blockchain to adhere to the current rules.

I'm worried that Steam won't bother implementing it again and that users won't bother asking for it, since they are used to using alts at that point.
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:55:52
But what is the point though. Let's say the miners choose to signal and mine a new change to Bitcoin. Your non-mining nodes choose to not follow the changes. When you go to send Bitcoin you validate with your node that supports the "true" bitcoin, but nobody is mining that coin any more, no matter how many non-mining nodes agree with yours.

How do I find a specific shop in the LN? Do I need to know their channel, or do I search for it by name and how can I be sure it's the correct one? Or do you always use QR?
Once you open a channel with let's say 10mBTC. Can I reupp the channel with 10 more mBTC without closing it and doing another an on-chain transaction?

Selling your Bitcoin BTC doesn't affect the forked coin balance since they are on another chain. You can sell/transfer all your BTC and then import the PK of the wallet they were on at the time of the fork to a wallet that supports the forked coin. For some of the shadier coins that's actually recommended. The balance of the forked coin will be the same as the day of the fork.

If rewards are low (few transactions) then less people will mine and the ones who mine get a larger share of the fees. Remember, Bitcoin has a difficulty adjustment, so even if there is just 100 miners the difficulty adjusts so that one block is mined roughly every 10 minutes no matter how many are mining. The only problem with few miners is that they can more easily perform a 51% attack.

Yeah. People think everyone can hodl to $100K and then sell it for fiat. As soon as 0.1% start to sell, the price will drop, because you need someone to be willing to buy at $100K. Maybe a few thousand people get to sell at $100K before people start lowering their price to $99K, then $98K .. $90K $80K etc. to find willing buyers.

The old address is still valid. You can make a new address for every transaction if you like. Be sure to write down the private key to your wallet. It's the key to all the addresses of your wallet. If you know the address you sent to, you can look up the progress of the transaction in a bitcoin block explorer

The amount of bitcoin doesn't matter, only that there can't be made more than 21 million of it. Very few trade with whole bitcoins today since not a lot of services and wares cost $13000. The coins are divided into cBTC 0.01 BTC, mBTC 0.001 BTC, and all the way down to 0.00000001 BTC which is one Satoshi. 
Price fluctuations can be an issue with slow transactions, but the price won't go up forever. There is only so much money in the world.

Then he want's to buy meat from the butcher, but he doesn't have a channel open with the butcher, but the coffee shop does. Now Jimmy has $100 in the multi signature address signed by him and the coffee shop. Now when he buys a $20 stake from the butcher, is that taken from the multi sig address? Or is it moved from Jim and the coffee shops address to the coffee shop and the butchers address? If that's the case, what happens if the channel between the coffee shop and the butcher closes before the one with Jimmy and the coffee shop?

The goal is for the shit to never hit the fan. The ideal situation is where people start spending/trading Bitcoin without cashing out for fiat before we reach $100K or 1$M. And for those who just own Bitcoin as a pure investment, they can have their personal "moons". If your goal is to buy a Motorcycle or a House, sell it then (if they don't accept Bitcoin).

@_date: 2017-12-05 07:44:45


What, why?
What value does mining gold have, other than they get more gold?
They destroy forests, pollute waters but the only value is them getting more gold. Same with Bitcoin, miners get more more bitcoins. Gold is valuable because it doesn't break down and there is a limited supply of it and you can't just go into the Forrest and pick up some more, it takes a lot of effort to mine gold. Same with Bitcoin. Limited supply and you can't just mine it on your cellphone, it takes effort.
And the value of Bitcoin is also the technology and the vast framework of decentralized computers handling transactions.

Nothing is wrong with the transaction other than it taking long now because of congestion.
It will get there, when depends on the fee you paid.
If you are in a hurry you can accelerate the transaction.

I'm a bit paranoid about storing it online. But you can encrypt a container and in that container hide the phrase in a document with other text and to a Caesar-shift or some other obfuscation to ward off automatic searches.

I don't like them but  you can trade.
Check what trading pairs are available before you deposit coins. Not all can be exchanged directly, but BTC can usually be traded with all.
We saw a lot of people losing money on margin trading, so don't go into that shit.
We have also seen that exchanges tend to go down during huge rallies up and down, so you might not be able to sell/buy when you want during the largest fluctuations.

It depends on the wallet or exchange. If they support it, they make, or you create a new "forkedcoin" wallet and the balance should show the same number of the forked coin as you had BTC before the fork. If you have you coins on a wallet or exchange where it's not supported, but you have your private key, you can import the Private Key to a wallet that supports the forked currency. You can empty the wallet of Bitcoins first if you don't want to transfer the Bitcoin on it. The forked coins are still on the address you had them on before the fork, you just can't see them before it's on a wallet that supports it. Some wallets support multiple cryptocurrencies. The Coinomi wallet for example.

You can always check the transactions of your public address in a Bitcoin block explorer. You can import the private key to a wallet or exchange you trust when you want to do transactions. You can transfer the funds to a new wallet with a new private key again if you don't trust them.

If your transaction does not go through in 14 days it will just cancel and you coins will go back to your wallet. Depending on the mempool size. There are no guarantees, so some of these probably overpay go make sure their transaction get through.

Well you could give him the Whitepaper. 
 It's not very long or overly technical.
But I could help you with some talking points, if you want to discuss it.
Basically the idea is for Bitcoin to be like gold except you can transfer it electronically to anywhere in the world in an instant. If the work done to mine Bitcoin could be used to run Google or Facebooks services, then that work would pay for itself. You could just implement bitcoin miners in the datacenters and they would get bitcoin + running their services. There needs to be a cost and work to mining bitcoin to keep it valuable and rare.
Gold used to be a currency as well, not just a commodity. But it was impractical to transfer and there wasn't enough of it. Then they printed money that had backing in gold, so you could always exchange your bank notes to gold in the bank. But with the system we have now [FIAT]( there is no backing in gold and they can and do print as much money as they want. So if you own a $100 note and they decide to print twice as much money, your $100 will be worth only $50 in purchasing power because of the inflation.

@_date: 2017-12-15 09:11:12


If it's math then you need to add all the factors.
Hardware cost and bandwidth doesn't stay still.
How much does storage and bandwidth cost now compared to in 2009? 
I agree completely that only scaling on chain will quickly become unsustainable, but I don't see any problems at all with scaling both the according to hardware cost together with Segwit, LN or even 3rd layers.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:41:10

@_date: 2017-12-22 08:44:53
You can't just upgrade the clients though. You need to transfer the coins to a Segwit address which cost fees.

2MB will not decrease the number of nodes by any significant amount and together with Segwit and LN we could have a functioning Bitcoin. The price of hardware has decreased steadily since the 1MB limit was set. If scaling is done in relation to hardware and bandwith prices, there should be no loss of nodes.

Well, as you see on the bottom are the low fee ones measured in Satoshi per byte and upward the transactions with higher fees. If you look at the past two days there are more transactions with higher fees. These are willing to pay to get ahead in the queue because there is a buildup of unconfirmed transactions. If you can, you would want to wait for a level like on dec. 4th or nov. 26th for instance.

Buying the dip is buying when Bitcoin has fallen or is falling. If it falls further, just don't sell until it rises again. No need to be psychic. 
Bitcoin is close to ATH again so the only losers are the ones who bought at the top and/or the ones that sold before it rose again.

There is no desire to see holders face financial ruin. It says they "deserve it", which is a bit hash. But if you take something that is supposed to be a electronic cash system and try to make it in to a store of value with no other uses it will fail once the price starts to drop.

@_date: 2017-11-13 13:55:20
High volumes no, but big money yes. It will support large transfers. People don't mind paying $20 to transfer 50 BTC and will get the transaction through quickly. But millions of people paying for coffe with BTC won't get their transactions through unless they pay more than the coffey cost in transaction fees.
It won't be scaled on the chain but the plan seems to be to rely on 2nd and 3rd layers to handle transactions like Lighning Network (LN). Not sure when this will be complete. 18 Months have been tossed around, but I don't know.

Edit:Oh, the QR-code... I need to set it up again and backup the QR code. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:47:24
I have lot's of examples of people cashing out. It's people who invested in Bitcoin to reach a certain goal. We have seen a lot of student loans being paid, mortgages etc. 
But the most important thing is to not invest more than you can afford to lose. It's not because I think Bitcoin will tank. It's more because we see many examples of people investing too much and get nervous and sells at a $1000 or $2000 drop in price. You need to invest a comfortable amount so you can wait for the price to rise.
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:26:26
Hmm. I think the problem was specific with the QR-code URI. Just enter the address to your wallet manually?

I have two pieces of advice for you. Do not invest more than you are willing to lose. 
And buy after a dip.
There will probably be a dip after nov. 16. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:07:23
I don't buy any reasons for not scaling to 2, 4 or even 8 MB. All the issues with larger blocks such as centralization and nodes are not going to be a problem before way larger block sizes.

Where is this Lightening network?
I should say, I'm not in support of Segwit2x. 
But since the LN in not ready yet and there **is** congestion, why not increase capacity in the meantime at least?
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:37:26
Two reasons: 
1) If you don't control your private key you don't control your wallet. (On exchanges you don't) If you lose your usb/paper wallet, all you need is your wallet ID and Private key to restore.
2)Look what happened during the august split. BTC holders are unable to get their B** from the split because they are held by coinbase until january.

See the bar at the left? That's the fee in Satoshi.
They gray layer at the bottom is transactions of 0-5 Satoshi, and it remains stable all the way. The spike is caused by miners leaving to mine other coin because it was more profitable at the time, thus causing the mem pool to fill up with unprocessed transactions. When that happens people pay more fees to get their transaction through first.
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:39:12
What's the usual fee?

In theory at least. But everyone can't sell at $10K. If even 0.01% were trying to sell at $10K the price would drop because the $10K orders would  be filled. And then $9K and downward.. a few would manage to cash out, but not most.

Somebody has to front the changes. They always knew they needed support to make the changes and they had it at NYA and 85% of miners were with them. When support dropped below 75% they knew it would cause a split and be detrimental to bitcoin and  called it off. Worked exactly like it should. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:11:22


It's more about nodes than mining hash-power. The blockchain will get so large you would eventually need terrabytes of storage space added every year to run a node. Mining is already so difficult it's becoming centralized.

@_date: 2017-11-30 08:14:11
That depends. Have you own goals. If you need the money, cash out what you need. If you don't need it, keep it to be in on the rise. The goal for true believers of Bitcoin, wo are not just investors, is that you won't ever need to transfer to FIAT. The goal is to buy, cars, houses, groceries with Bitcoin. For this to happen, Bitcoin need to scale though, either on or off the blockchain.

This illustration assumes it will be a split
Segwit2x could have different outcomes.
These include:
* Bitcoin's rules change. Most (or all) miners upgrade their software. The bitcoin blockchain continues to function but features larger blocks. Segwit2x's rules become the rules of bitcoin.
* Two bitcoins are created. Only some miners upgrade their software. This creates two blockchains – a so-called "legacy" bitcoin, and a "Segwit2x" bitcoin, both with different rules and unique cryptocurrencies.
* Bitcoin's rules do not change. No significant miners run the new software, and the network continues to run the current rules.

From what I understand, mining is doing work that has a certain **chance** of producing a string with a certain amount of zeros in a row. So it's actually already just a matter of time, except it's doing the same hard work while attempting it. Seems like a big waste to me and it makes mining centralized since there are a few data-centers that do most of the mining because of the hardware requirements.

I don't see any dips in the graph nov. 25 2016 or nov. 27 2015

That's Bitcoin Cash FYI. Still, 3.3x increase in 26 days is not bad.

Having thousands of PC's and cheap ASICS mining instead of a dozen large mining centers could make it more decentralized than it is today. But it's true. Some rich people could catch everyone off guard and fire up a huge mining operation to take over.

If 99.9% of today's miners stop mining, difficulty would decrease and people can mine with the CPU on their 4 year old laptop again.

Only if everyone stopped mining at once. More likely it would be a gradual decline.

This would be good if the number transactions weren't falling.

That depends on how you define success. If it's to become globally adopted and compete with FIAT it needs to be adopted as a currency. It's somewhat successfull now, but a store of value that goes from $19K to $9K in  a month is not really usefull.

It's not about USD. It's about purchasing power. 
If you can buy a keg of beer for 50 sat you would care about paying 50 sat fees.

If it was a sure thing the value would be 400K already, that's how markets work.

The problem is that bans anyone voicing other opinions.

I'm just a normal Bitcoin owner and user. I don't understand half of what's being discussed here. I don't want bitcoin cash, gold or any splits and forks. I just want bitcoin to be fast and cheap to use. The way it is now it takes a long time to transact and it's waay costly. I don't see why bitcoin can't just increase it's block size. I understand people not being able to run a node on a rasberry pie will cause fewer nodes but how much of a hardware increase are we talking for 2MB or even 8MB block size?

If you can't spare to lose the money or can't wait for an eventual rise over 1800's again if it goes down you should sell. I only put money I can afford to have tied up in BTC for years.

A large estabished company like GMO has a bit more accountability than what was originally a Magic the gathering trading site.

I'm loading up if it goes below $2000
