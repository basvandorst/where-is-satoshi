Shit. I'm on day 3 for a wire transfer to Coinbase Pro. I did a secondary wire transfer (non crypt) right after the one to coinbase. Received it that afternoon. But the one to coinbase? Still waiting. For a company that is supposed to be a gateway into "the new financial revolution of fast, easy and reliable banking" sure as hell is doing a horrible job.

I've never heard of of a wire transfer taking 7-10 business days. All resources say the same thing for wire transfer. Same-day or 1 business day. Which has been my experience for years.

This is taking the time travels paradox way too seriously.

You can buy it with anything all a matter of negotiation. Make me an offer I can't refuse.

They might not reference the word a trillion exactly but we definitely use other units of measure that equate to a trillion if not numbers larger than that more frequently than we think.  
Take mining for bitcoin, for example, we talk in TH/s which is how many trillion hashes per second are computed. As Bitcoin enthusiast what about referencing the number of satoshis (21M \* 100M).  
In tech, we use units that represent trillions if not larger numbers quite frequently. A trillion is not that unfathomable. All a matter of what you're counting.

I don't think there is anything technical or fundamental that indicates a 20%+ surge in price. I think tomorrow price will be hovering in the $3700 range.

Forgive my ignorance, but who's pulling their money out?

Oh! Vive la Résistance! Fascinating times to be alive. Will definitely be watching France a bit more closely.

I think you missed the the Supply and Demand concept in the analogy it applies to all goods digital or not. If a person is buying it and selling it then supply and demand governs the worth.

That's going to me one expensive pen in a couple years.
