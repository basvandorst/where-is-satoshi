it all depends on the merchant and the particular deal they have worked out. this really isnt public information. my *guess* is gyft probably makes $3-5 per $100 card.

@_date: 2014-05-31 03:08:22
@_date: 2014-07-17 02:17:25
since you have 1.6, the price would only need to stop like $60 for you to lose money, but that is highly unlikely in the next 4 days. If anything we are at a low point.

never said greatest was a qualification of 'greatest philosopher'... greatest is a qualification of his skills as a philosopher... which is fine. i was just making sure you're going to be consistent when you say he shouldn't qualify. and i think saying "in our time" suggests that he is the greatest among philosophers who are *alive*.

what does registering it have to do with the fact that they kill people. by your logic if something can be used for bad things then it should be outlawed. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:47:47
the government has us relying on them and thinking that the only way people in need will be taken care of is through then (force). in a free society, there will much a whole new level of abundance and opportunity that in the rare case someone cant find a job or work for themselves, there will be far greater charity resources for those in need.

I was thinking about this yesterday actually, and I came to the conclusion that starting a business and donating some of the profits to people, or charities with direct speciality, would be a better use of my time, at least. Then also, encourage other business owners to do the same. 
And yea, the voting/who gets the money thing is hard. Application process would be labor/eyeball intensive and still too much human judgement/misjudgement.

holy shit, whilst!?!? you must be fucking smart.
@_date: 2014-06-15 02:46:45
except the fact that this problem as been solved, there was never a 51% attack, even if there was it wouldn't have mattered, and Bitcoin is doing just fine. Meanwhile, the governing bodies who would be "regulating" said market are responsible for 100s of millions of deaths since their inception. sounds like a good reason to regulate!

I was actually just trying to get your opinion. I am fully supportive of AC's and they are interesting. I dont understand why a person would ever give up ownership of a profitable AC tho
edit: nevermind i guess the AC could amass a bitcoin nest egg and make an offer to be "free" from its owner, probably something like 3x its yearly earnings.

please short bitcoin if you're so sure. bitfinex.com.

by putting Coinbase in parenthesis after Bitcoin, they're telling you which exchange they're deriving the price from. If they were showing Bitstamp's price, it would say Bitcoin (Bitstamp). This is important because, as I'm sure you're aware, there are different prices at every exchange at every moment.

or..... i mined bitcoin in 2011 and have a lot of them to spend, and actually gyft rewards you 3% bonus (no fees) so then i can spend them to get around town.

maybe.. i know what your saying but theres only a few sites i know like that ;)

this is silly... you profited from an investment, but your "biggest mistake in life" is not making much more? sounds like youre just being greedy again. hindsight is always 20/20... NXT could have face-planted. consider yourself lucky.
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:35:58
really? maybe you dont know how "laws" work... but just because you walk down a dark alley and get robbed doesn't mean is your own fault smh.
@_date: 2014-10-20 22:22:04
not really. no miner has a contract with people using the bitcoin system.

you dont spring out of bed when you have something fun to do? and sluggish when you have to work? of course getting out of bed is motivated by rational incentives.

you forfeit only if you dont get out of bed though, hence the spring reaction...

@_date: 2013-07-08 16:31:59
so because you read some circlejerk bitcoin advice on a bitcoin forum (shocking) you negate all analysis, as your original (bad) wizard joke implies? i do like your made up stories about big banksters and price manipulation tho. are you, in fact, the wizard?

so do foolish ones.

you're confused. break even means net profit/loss = 0. converting all my trading assets to USD, i have the same $ as i did when i started.

ahh, i see youre the one that posted it! thanks!
@_date: 2013-07-26 21:33:43
Just a thought, but CampBX requires you have that amount in your dwolla account balance before you can transfer. Are you sure your money isnt just sitting your bank account still?
@_date: 2013-10-21 00:46:25
lol how do u know it originated on @_date: 2013-10-12 16:53:16
The instructions are horrible.
Login to Bitfunder. Click 'Transfer' in the secondary navigation menu at the top. Select your NeoBee assets from the list, enter the amount, and then enter NeoBee for the "User name of the person you are sending to:" field. Then hit Transfer. This is the "pushing" they're referring to.
The address they are talking about is the email address. John (TaT) will also need your Bitfunder username (but he didnt put this in the instructions either).
So after you Transfer (aka Push) the shares to NeoBee your email to tat.investments will look like this.
    Havelock email address: ________@________.com
    Number of shares to transfer: ________
    Bitfunder username: ________
Hope this helps.

well considering USD is still by fucking far more dominate the BTC, and every ticker has the USD price per BTC, thats how a professional like myself keeps track of our gains BRO.

wouldnt it make sense to send your coins to a different wallet or a web wallet with 2FA til you figure it out?
@_date: 2013-09-25 04:33:55
should be noted that the 1 BTC per share of mcxFEE puts the site's valuation at a cool $13 million USD... lol

theres no doubt in my mind if Silkroad goes down BTC price plummets. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 01:20:20
how do you know it happened today? you could have been infected weeks ago, only to have the attacker steal your wallet.dat today.
i dont see how just self posts on could infect your computer, and i considering your on linux is just highly unlikely.
My two cents: wallet.dat was the last changed file and for some reason it was the default folder when firefox browser opened. if someone actually stole your wallet.dat it would have been drained in seconds.
@_date: 2013-10-10 19:34:48
i also received this email, and I do not have a merchant account. 
not sure if everyone got this email, or just people who have dealt with exchanges. dumb move by dwolla.

this is such a childish reaction to the idea of legitimate market analysis. its like a poker player saying "derrrr i have a 50/50 chance to win this pot, either i have the better hand or i dont" ... no 
@_date: 2013-10-24 08:47:41
nah its over bro
@_date: 2013-09-10 13:22:04
le sigh... a market is not a random game of chance. its rational drivers performing rational fiduciary decisions. 
whats even more, is that the gamblers fallacy states that if something has happened a lot, it wont happen in the future. I am actually saying the opposite. That it has happened in the past, therefore it will continue to happen. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:02:30

you can do cash deposit to a bank using a regular deposit slip. make an offer for cash deposit on Localbitcoins, wait for the coins to be in escrow, go to the sellers bank and deposit the cash. seller will release from escrow when he sees the cash deposit.

seriously... this is the 2nd time he's said "bitcoin user not affected" when clearly bitcoin users are affected.
