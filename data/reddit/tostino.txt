And its fucking cold. That's the other thing that sucks about Canada.

Its not technology related though.
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:38:01
Care to explain?

Until the next bubble, when you have to pay it off at 1,500

That does not mean that the money was given for an ethical reason, just that the transaction it self was ethical.

As an example of that not working well... I'm on my android, and all I see is: and apart from anything the   is not as pretty.

Or, instead of burying your head in the sand, you can stay informed about things which may effect you.

Yes, but ltc is a whole lot more safe than btc from 1-3 confs, to btc's 0.

I'm sure that's exactly how a lender would set up the deal. Stealing bit coins is just as illegal as stealing a painting or other asset worth lots of money.

@_date: 2014-03-28 23:34:51
I don't even know what to think any more with all this strangeness going on.
@_date: 2014-04-26 04:32:47
What a troll.

฿ is fine, its the other one I can't see.
Edit: and its not only one app. Its not working in chrome either when I checked.
