He means no charge-backs. No fraud risk.

Nope. You are about 2 years too late. The only people who start mining now are people who do it as a hobby, and who know that they will not get the money back that they spent on their ASIC's.

If they are insolvent, I highly doubt it is due to spending/losing money. My guess would be that they have an immature trading platform that couldn't handle the volume coming through it everyday. They might have subtle race conditions, poor database design and management, and suddenly transactions mysteriously disappear or become inaccurate. Balances on accounts don't match balances in their blockchain wallets. And they have been trying to prop up the system for months now but the truth is, they don't have the bitcoin or the fiat to match what their database says all accounts should have. And when people try to withdraw those non-existent coins, what can they do?

Hershey's Chocolate of course! Mmmm, mmmm.

I think the OP means that $3.6 million worth of mining equipment (servers) are gone.

Through the mt. goat online exchange of course. Send your goats to japan and get bitcoin for them.

He said "young professional", so probably not. And even then, only as a vague understanding of a bad time for some older people. If this guy is 25, 26, 27 years old, then at the time of the crash he had no real wealth. He had no 401k, had no property, and was probably already in debt. To you and me, starting out in the real world means starting at square 1. To him, and millions like him, starting out means starting at square negative 10. That is their normal. So appealing the emotional impact of that event is completely lost on him.

That's the exact justification the ultra-wealthy give to themselves when hiding money in offshore shell companies. Governments don't tax risk, they tax income, and a profit from an investment is income no matter how much risk was involved.
