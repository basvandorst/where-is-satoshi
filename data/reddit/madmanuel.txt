"Best" according to whom?

Let me know when it gets to this point:

That totally explains why Ethereum has doubled in the last two weeks while the other currencies have dropped significantly.
@_date: 2019-07-02 12:34:43
It is essentially the greatest lost treasure on the planet.

Considering less than 8 hours later, and we’re a hairs breadth from 13,000 I think we need to stop celebrating every $1000, and start celebrating every $10k
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:09:44
Gonna have to Gold you for that bad boy.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:33:34
Wow. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:20:26
So a great deal of new blood entered the space.. parents, grand parents, retirees, and probably some well armed veterans.. I suspect even some larger crime syndicates, or authoritarian governmental entities who weren’t in on the scheme - folks with a long reach, and an axe to grind.
Seeing their investment wiped out - coupled with a very obvious villain in the form of Mr. Ver...
If Roger Ver hasn’t spent a portion of his new wealth on personal security services, I sincerely doubt he’ll make it through 2018.. Ver can only hold up his hands and say that insider trading is all part of the game for so long. 
Someone is going to drop him down an elevator shaft on to some bullets.

That only covers the countries who celebrate Christmas.. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:33:20
I greatly appreciate the explanation. 
I can see now that bitcoin will collapse under its own weight, if the only people able to run full nodes effectively are the big boys with millions in hardware to throw at the problem. 
And why lighting transactions are so important.
But there will always be smaller transactions on the ledger too.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:26:31
Reading this, I want to build a dedicated rig just to process low and medium fee transactions.
On the basis that it’s an ignored market, and there for would be low competition..
But I’ve never mined, and honestly don’t know if it’s possible to specifically request lower fee blocks?

Adding 1.5Trillion to the US Debt like this new tax bill will do, plus a president who thinks its 'no big deal' for the US to default on its debt... may cause you to revisit that opinion.

How is Gemini’s trading platform?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:14:44
Gemini doesn't let me buy/trade litecoin.. so for the moment, I'm sticking with GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:35:03
Did you pay in BTC?
If you didn’t.. where did you liquidate your coins?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:33:37
And almost $19k an hour after yours.
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:40:39
Cut out the middle man.
Take it rectally.

The dude died. Otherwise he/she’d be spending their billions.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:15:59
I wish I hadn’t told my family about it. Not because I don’t trust them..
But because every time I turn around they’re emailing me suggestions, advice, news articles on how I’m an idiot for investing, how it won’t last, how it’s a bubble blah blah blah - all written by old school financial folk who haven’t researched their subject beyond ‘if it’s new, and I didn’t get in on it, it must be bad’
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:59:10
I'll say "I took your advice back when it was $5000, and sold"
@_date: 2018-09-14 13:30:05
Mate, you should get yourself checked out, I think you may have Parkinson’s.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:45:02
It benefits the network.
Additionally, my own transactions are often smaller, so the hopes of an immediate single confirmation is a plus too.
@_date: 2018-09-17 14:52:23
Bloomberg does exactly the same thing, and those Terminals are thousands $$.
@_date: 2018-08-11 22:12:52
According to Forbes he's still worth $100million so I think ol' Belforte is still doing ok.
@_date: 2018-08-21 10:59:50
I was considering a sale on Local Bitcoins the other day for some fast cash, but now jesus.. I'll stick with coinbase.
@_date: 2018-10-26 15:35:52
Agreed. I've seen good and bad news come out that would  previously caused significant shifts in volatility.  I believe the coins are being made artificially stable in order to effect a positive result on the ETF proposals.. The past denials of said proposals have faulted volatility in their arguments for denial.
@_date: 2017-01-01 20:41:30
Currencies aren't supposed to 'perform' they're supposed to be stable.
@_date: 2018-06-15 16:58:38
If it’s not a security how do I pay taxes on it?
@_date: 2018-06-27 04:36:23
...until the power goes out.

How the fuck has this not turned into a civil war?
@_date: 2019-08-15 17:16:41
If it’s above $10k, it ain’t a price collapse to me!
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:00:58
This is not a 'bitcoin' problem. This is a 'your friend is a fucking moron' problem.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:52:54
All I’m saying is consider the source before you hoist him up on your shoulders because he says ‘hooray bitcoin.’
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:28:35
Check again - we're over $11k now . 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:13:51
They do when it is volatility that they make their money off pf.

Tell that to the folks who took Cramer’s advice on Lehman Brothers, and Bear Stearns.

$10,666 now... 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:30:37
I'd like to point out that Bitcoin has been skyrocketting well before these two exchange groups got involved. 
It's more likely that these two exchange groups are launching bitcoin futures because Bitcoin is Skyrocketing.. not the other way around. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:33:58
But bitcoin is more than a traditional asset, it’s part of a network.  Network based companies are valued by the amount of regular users squared. 
Or N(2) - that should be N squared, but Reddit formatting doesn’t work on mobile.
Do we need to re-evaluate how bitcoin is valued beyond the traditional asset value?
Even gold becomes worthless if there is nowhere to spend it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:49:06
Until 2030 when it sinks beneath the waves because climate change.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:25:39
Let’s remember though that Jim Cramer also told us to keep buying bank stocks during the housing market collapse.
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:32:35
Have you had any issues selling on Gemini? Caps?
@_date: 2018-03-12 08:45:42
The fuck is up with that kids teeth? 
@_date: 2016-09-29 18:51:00
I wish this guy would stay away from Bitcoin.. Everything he touches turns to shit

Put that on an iOS App Store and I'd buy it.

Without electricity and internet access, I think it's unlikely.
@_date: 2017-09-25 11:47:22
I think the entire world's market capitalization is around $68 trillion..
For 1 bitcoin to equal $1 million, in the next say 20 years the market cap of Bitcoin would have to be in the neighborhood of $18 Trillion.. 
And we're about $62 billion now. 
I can see Bitcoin hitting 200 billion easy ($12,000 BTC) . Maybe even 500 billion ($30,000 BTC)
but I don't think we'll ever hit $1 trillion, let alone $18 Trillion.

Direct from the website, and paid for expedited UPS. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:23:48
Yes! Drop back to $2100 then I'll buy more!

I wouldn't mind being a courier to bring BTC from behind the great firewall to sell on the open exchanges.
Call it 20Btc and I'd fly to where ever. 
No idea where to advertise that as a service tho.
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:38:06
Just double checked. UPS express is delivering tomorrow. 
I chose the expedited shipping because I wanted to make sure to get my coins off Coinbase in a hurry.

The US hit 2.9% inflation just for the month of June.. it’s already started.

No worries, I wasnt holding you to your word, or thinking you were being prophetic. 
Just throwing out the numbers that would have to happen for 1 BTC to equal $1 million.

The ledger wallet website says new orders won't ship til the 15th of November but, I ordered one yesterday, and it shipped out last night.

I bought in mid September @ $4400, and it's up to $5850 now, but has already passed the $6k sell off point... it's still climbing.
I'm betting $8k by end of year.

Personally I think some of the bigger hedge funds got some inside information on the bitcoin hearings happening on Wednesday.
@_date: 2016-10-03 03:41:00
You do know that I can disagree with you, and that's not a troll comment right? .. That's a difference of opinion. 
Grow up.
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:36:26
Tell me about it. I had the opportunity to buy 15,000 bitcoins for. $100 back in '10..
Such a cheap gamble.. And I didn't take it.
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:48:46
If tulip bulbs driven by speculation on 'how high will it go' can be a bubble in the 1600s..
Then bitcoin can totally be a bubble.
