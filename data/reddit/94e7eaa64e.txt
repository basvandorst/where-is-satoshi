People know about this threat, hence they aren't keeping all their eggs in one basket. Most crypto aficionados have their portfolios neatly distributed between btc, ltc, ether and possibly others. If btc goes down, all that happens is one of the several others becomes mainstream. Think about what happens if amazon went down today? Do the people stop buying goods, or will they buy it from ebay, walmart, overstock, etc.? I think its the latter.

Even if bitcoin were to end because of an attack (theoretically speaking), the crypto currency world has become a sort of hydra now. "Cut off one head, and two more shall rise", as they say.

They already have, sort of. Its called amazon gift card.

It surely was American when Satoshi put the bitcoin proposal.

That needs to happen quickly for long-term health of btc. Presently, people are throwing money at bitcoin only because of the "bitcoin story", but like all markets and stories, sooner or later it has to end somewhere. In that circumstance, what will be there to stop btc from going down to the all the way to zero due to selling pressure? Only its wide acceptance as a medium of exchange can help sustain that fall.

It doesn't work outside of US, though. Amazon.com cards cannot be redeemed on Amazon.co.uk, for example.

It has, but not for the [reasons that most people presume](


The transaction cost has surely jumped up for btc lately and these must go back down if btc were to become dominant as a currency, otherwise it will just be an investment vehicle like many others, but never a widely accepted currency which should be the true goal.

That's one thing I'm unable to understand, why have the fees risen all of a sudden. Is it the case that there aren't enough miners to process increased number of transactions, so they are demanding a lot of fees?

True, but even Linux is sort of decentralized and developed well under the leadership of Linus Torvalds, so you never know, centralized leadership could have been a good thing.
