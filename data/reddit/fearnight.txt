"Buh buh but ... Bitcoin is in a bubble. It's about to burst, don't buy." - June 2017
Seriously, if I didn't believe this at the time I would have bought 10 BTC.

Doubt it's the top since it takes up to 2 weeks to get a Coinbase account verified and funded.

So what other trustworthy exchange do you suggest for US users, that accepts ACH USD bank deposits? 
Kraken is too slow. Gemini has a ridiculous $500 daily ACH deposit limit. I liked Bitfinex but they no longer service US customers. Never tried Bitstamp but I've heard similar complaints as with Kraken.
Believe me, if Bittrex or Binance could do USD deposits without Tether I'd be all over that. Right now I feel pretty much stuck with GDAX.

To the moon, brother.

A true dip is when the price touches the 120 day moving average. My reaction is to BUY!

This has nothing to do with Coinbase. They are just picking the fastest fee so your coins confirm within 1-2 blocks. 
Yeah, maybe they should let the user choose their speed / fee, but that goes against the simplicity they are after for their users.

What amazes me are the articles that were published hours ago about how BTC just crested a new all time high of 13k! And by the time most readers were reading it, it was already at $14-14.4k. We are living in exciting times my friends.

This is perfect. This has and will continue to happen to many a poor soul.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:27:46
I think people are overlooking how big of a deal this is. I figure we have about a week - week and a half until their bank accounts are verified and accounts funded.
Almost every new sign up will buy BTC, but a majority will most likely also purchase ETH and LTC. And any new coins that get listed on Coinbase in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:05:00
Long term, yes. Short term, it could go to $10k. Nobody has a crystal ball.

I think I have the perfect wallet for you, especially considering your name.

What is the transaction ID? I've accidentally sent a much lower fee before and it eventually went through after 4 days.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:39:01
Yeah. I bought a 2nd one as backup on Black Friday. Even the regular price is very affordable.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:34:48
Still waiting on that "big" dip everybody keeps talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:27:02
Always armed.
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:35:09
Thank you for your sacrifice. Let us know when you buy back in so we'll know it's the peak.

I'm sure most of us have USB drives that are more than 10 years old. Plug one in and see if it still works.

Assuming you filed your gains correctly, nothing. However, there are thousands of folks on the list that didn't file any gains and are about to get a really large bill and a fine from the IRS. Depending on the amount of money involved, they can be charged with high dollar tax fraud which carries incredibly large fines and jail time. 


Anybody that never reported should probably go ahead and amend their tax returns right now, especially if you had 6 or 7 figures in gains. Pay the taxes, penalty, and hopefully avoid jail time.

US government would never ban it. Regulate and tax, sure. The bigger crypto grows, the more tax revenue rolls in.
@_date: 2018-04-14 01:07:19
And it will go right back into panic and cynicism as soon as it dips again.

The "WHY" is because any exchange is susceptible to getting hacked. Once hacked, the hackers can transfer your funds from your account to their account. 
Nobody said you have to cash out immediately, just to not store your coins on an exchange and expect them to be safe for good. I keep funds on the exchanges I use, but only to keep trading going, and never just let large amounts sit there for weeks or months. Just play it smart and you will be fine.
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:39:39
The keyword in the warning is not to **store** Bitcoin on an exchange. Meaning, don't keep all your funds sitting there for long term holds and assume they are safe. Keep just enough so that you can keep trading, but keep the funds you plan to hold longer term in an offline wallet.

Now that is cool. 
@_date: 2019-05-11 01:15:46
They can't just print more at a whim so that's a problem for them. Sounds a lot like FDR's gold ban, doesn't it?
@_date: 2017-07-30 23:35:08
Which exchange do you recommend for ACH USD bank deposits? I consider myself lucky that my Coinbase BTC withdrawal yesterday only took 10 hours; today it is even higher. I need to find somewhere without such a backlog.
