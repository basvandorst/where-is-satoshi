This same thing happened to a friend of mine a few days ago.
This wallet corruption seems to be a MultiBit HD thing.
Anyway you cannot use electrum to swipe the seed words because it use a slightly different bip39 implementation.
If, as it seems, you have the seed words then there are at least two ways to recover your coins.
1) Install the breadwallet app on an Android 6.x+ or an iPhone phone (I also tried Mycelium but it did not work for me too).
-Start the app.
-Choose "recover wallet".
-Insert the MultiBit HD seed words.
-Let the phone sync the blockchain, it may take some time.
Once synced you should be able to see your balance and to send your coins to another cold/offline wallet (I am using Electrum right now).
2) As already suggested by you can use the Mnemonic Code Converter tool (  )
on an offline computer to recover your MultiBit HD keys.

Here are my notes on how to recover / rebuild / regenerate / extract the addresses and keys used by MultiBit HD:
-In the field "BIP39 Mnemonic" fill in your 12 wallet generation words
-No password
-Coin: Bitcoin
-Under Derivation Path, select the BIP32 tab
-Derivation path (copy paste this): m/0'/0
Your addresses are now displayed at the end of the page.
Now you can swipe the private keys into a different cold/offline wallet.
Sorry for my english.
