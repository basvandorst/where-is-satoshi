It's nice for me not having to listen to 100 people a week in the office telling me why crypto is the next Apple.

So $22k to $7k in less than 6 months is considered secure?

No its not, if you are not sure then why even post? Its the same as any capital asset, you use the average cost basis of to total holding. So if you bought between $1000 and $20,000 you take the total cost you bought and divide by the total number of btc to get the average cost basis. Then if you sell for above the average its a capital gain and and if you sell below its a capital loss. OP do some research or call an accountant, never trust what you read on the internet however correct hey may sound.

If Bitcoin ever wants to be a currency it needs to stabilize. Imagine if the US dollar lost over 50% of its value over the period of a couple months, vendors would never accept it. No one is ever going to accept Bitcoin if it can't hold its value.

The only way they are ever getting there is if more people adopt it and that will never happen in its current state. You can already see it loosing steam.

I would love anyone to make a case for how satellite provided internet could be offered for free.

What makes you think $1 million is the key to it being stable?

Cause a currency that goes for $1000 to $20,000 then back to $7000 is something i want to put my money in.

First reading that I was like WTF, but now I see what you did. Touche

People will actually still need to afford internet and that is still going to be a problem. Satellite internet currently exists, this isn't something revolutionary.
