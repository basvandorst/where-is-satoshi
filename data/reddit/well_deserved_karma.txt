Hmm but people *have* to live somewhere. They don't *have* to have Bitcoin. You only lose money when you sell - unless you lose it all if something 0's permanently.

Assuming bitcoin goes back up to 4300 or higher realsony will end up with more bitcoins, ~4300/3510 x more.

I don't know what you have against your off hand, calling it a stranger like that. It's so cold....

Well, yes. On the internet, I've learned that there's a lot of money in the banana stand.
Now I've just got to get a banana stand.

But also ACH, not that I really understand it, is an antiquated slow system.

But oh boy would it not be fun paying over $300k for the house I thought I owned all over again.

It looks to me like a *great* idea to sell on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, and to buy on Monday. Doesn't it? That is, if you have enough money to invest at all...
