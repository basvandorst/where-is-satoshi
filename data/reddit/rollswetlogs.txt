I will say I really want my investments to increase in value. That idea creates the most anticipation in me at this time. But once that does happen, I hope that the adoption of crypto currencies has come far enough that I can pay off my student loans or buy a house with my coins.

Thats about where I am, I just want to take part of my stash and pay off my student loans and save the rest for real adoptions.

Why? The first part. Do gay and trans people tend to buy more Nestle products? And here I thought people were born gay...

I usually take $20 of my paycheck each week and use it to buy BTC. I don’t day trade, if there is ever a monumental jump in price, like when the FOMO starts kicking in, it is SOMETIMES followed by a correction a few days later. I sell when I start getting antsy, and buy back in in the dip.

So question, since Mining drives transactions and decentralizes the network by rewarding miners with BTC, what happens when the final BTC is mined? What’s the incentive for miners to
Keep the network up?

Why not?
