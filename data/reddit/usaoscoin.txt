You can't do anything - Mt.Gox are holding our coins hostage. All you can do is wait until they are processed manually.
Some people are waiting up to a week.

Needless to say, stay away from Mt.Gox.

Makes sense, since the bulk of users of the other exchanges haven't started their day but the Chinese are just finishing theirs.
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:07:02
At the moment this is taking up to a week in some cases.

This is absolutely huge. The guy is basically like a Richard Branson type figure in Hong Kong - a lot of people follow him and he's in the public eye.
Deposits aren't limited in Hong Kong like China, so I would be sure to keep an eye on the local exchanges there for a huge boost in funds.
