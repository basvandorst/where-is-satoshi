Its almost as if it was supposed to be a currency instead of an investment
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:12:40
Only if you dont care about its value changing
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:42:34
No it is not.
Stock market finances companies which generate value.
(This is a very gross simplification but it gets the point across)
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:40:30
Until bitcoin is actually usable as currency, its all just hoping that whoever buys it from you thinks he is going to sell it for more to the next sucker
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:49:03


Because we talk about far less relevant stuff, as long as it makes BTC look good
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:55:55


I mean when there are posts going "whoa a local mall installed one single bitcoin ATM!!" and they get to the frontpage of the subreddit I think that Microsoft not taking Bitcoin is big enough yes.

People have gone with worse deals because a company backed them MANY times.
Easiest example: blu-ray or VHS
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:43:49
Yeah its just money which is barely, if ever, usable amirite??
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:19:17


The issue imo is that I don't think that even 10% of bitcoin belong to anyone who intends to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:54:33
That... Really doesn't even begin making sense.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:15:08
I do wonder who can afford to mine bitcoin.
Probably the average joe and not those who already hold most of the wealth, right?
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:57:47
BTC doesnt create money anywhere.
By the very workings of the system, someone making money means someone else lost it, its why i hate the idea of 'getting rich with bitcloin'
Getting rich with bitcoin and getting rich from a ponzi scheme are not very different
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:03:02


Bitcoin drop into suicides of course.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:59:55
And in which kind of fairy tale would governments ever allow that, with "Tax" being a concept that exists as well as "Law" being one that often forbids the purchasing and selling of certain goods?
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:13:15
That sounds like it goes against a decent amount of things Bitcoin is about.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:03:50


Oh please do point out how the fluctuations in price make total sense from the fluctuations in assessments or actual utility.
They don't.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:01:11


Which is kinda my point, how are they supposed to tax the gains if it's all in bitcoin? Honestly asking here, maybe there is something I am missing but as far as I know "Anonymous Guy A" makes a transaction to "Anonymous Guy B" for an amount and that's it, how do you calculate taxes based on that? 
How do you make sure everybody is paying taxes? 
What about taxes based on income?
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:09:54


As opposed to the random insecure guy who is always boasting about everything trying to make everybody think he is better?
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:42:08
But how do you actually calculate any of this? How do you tell a wallet and a person apart? How do you account for the belongings of a person in a verifiable way?
I'm talking about it in a systematic way, Bitcoin is built with anonymity into it and even though you can prove certain payment comes from a certain wallet I still don't see how you can tax individuals without knowing their identity.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:41:07
Which is irrelevant to the discussion
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:26:54
My point is precisely that its not the same.
And that even if it had the same properties, age would make it different
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:37:18
The comment especificslly talked about losing money.
I think its obcious I was talking about money
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:39:36


Aaaaand that's the problem, kinda.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:47:07


Well what were people saying?
And sure, you can't take decisions on what people say, but at some point the community has to look at itself and think what kind of message they are sending.
Maybe there will be a crash, maybe there won't, point of the matter is that many people talk about btc like it's a way to get rich when for every dollar won by someone, there is a dollar lost by some other guy and if you can get enough people to pretend the currency is valuable that makes it valuable.
It's not a ponzi scheme but there defenitely are people who want others to join btc in the exact same way people in a ponzi scheme want others to join it.
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:01:06
You could still block them though, same as you can block ads.
The difference is that this (in most cases) doesn't hurt user experience as much as ads. I think it's pretty interesting.
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:28:27


That 'only' is the difference between it being worth thousands of dollars or nothing
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:32:33
Not at all, there is a very important distinction to make.
On one side you have the amount of HOLDERS and on the other you have the amount of MONEY, and I think he is right to believe that the amount of money is more important than the amount of holders.

Because democratically elected government of a sovereign state chose to get into the union, because of considerable advantages of doing so.
Let's not pretend we were taken over or something, it's similar to state law vs federal law.
Could say, Texas start issuing a currency for Texas?

It's an arbitrary amount of work though, and one that consumes a whole fucking lot of energy.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:21:23
At this point I just always assume that posts filled with emotion like this are shills.
The writing style and tone are those of a political pundit and not even on the same level, and the thing is that if the people posting these actually had the point of view to support their own posts they wouldn't post at all, it wouldn't make sense.
It 100% looks like people trying to change people's opinion and nothing else.

No kidding I don't have the kind of money to invest in bitcoin but I kind of envy how fun following the whole thing must be.

Ahh yes, current capitalism doesn't turn the majority of the population into little bitches for the oligarchs fast enough, I agree we need to speed this up.
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:09:46


That's literally wrong though, I won't say that a dollar has an inherent value, it doesn't, but that doesn't turn it into inherently worthless.
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:35:28
Completely agree with the whole post, but you'll probably agree with me that that's not how many people see it or preach it **at all**, so I understand calling it a scam under the premise that it was preached to them in a different way.

So what happens if the EU or the US decide to switch to a crypto of their own, fully backed by the state and law?
Imagine such announcement happening in the coming months, something along the lines of "in 2-3 years cryptoeuro will be the standard for online banking, by law".
What would happen to bitcoin then?
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:13:35


Question is, how many people will take those chances?
I'm getting the impression that you don't even realize what you yourself are claiming is going to happen.
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:27:22


Honestly that's just retarded.
With that kind of logic merchants wouldn't take fiat, and what are you even supposed to do, start talking to the guy? The one who probably doesn't even own the business? Pester cashiers to the point they speak up?
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:37:34


You could say the same about lottery or the stock market, you have to understand what makes a good decision and what doesn't.
Picture this scenario:
You are presented with 2 buttons, one of them has a 80% chance of triggering a mechanism that punches you in the face and a 20% chance of giving you 10 dollars.
The other has a 20% for the punch, 80% for the money.
Obviously the good decision (assuming you have to press one) is to press the second one, it has less risk for the same payback. Your informed opinion at this point is that second button is better, and that decision is best.
So you press it and sadly punch happens, after that I inform you that I lied to you and the buttons worked the other way around.
Was your decision wrong?
No it wasn't, your decision was sound and made the most sense, there was no mistake made on your part, there is a difference between decisions being right and wrong and them ending up well or not.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:22:08
This might be a little misunderstanding, I assumed that by "put the $ at the end of the number" the poster above was referring to putting the currency symbol at the end.
I don't know if French people specifically place dollar signs at the end.
I'm also not sure about UK since it has been a long time since I was there, but I'm currently residing in poland and here the format is definitely "XX.xx zł"

And how is ASIC mining anywhere near fair for that matter?
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:33:05

I don't understand, **someone ALWAYS** loses money.
If I buy at 12 and sell at 18 I've won 6 bucks, but if that guy sells at 12 he has lost 6 bucks.
BTC by itself is really not worth anything, the idea that people profit on bitcoin is based on there being some guy who expects to sell for an even higher value.

You seem to think that people invest in bitcoin out of ideology, not out of greed.
And while there are people who actually do that, about everything points to greed being the motivator for most people. 
Otherwise people would care less about "Bitcoin has just hit XXX$!" and more about "Bitcoin is gaining adoption"
"Hodl" wouldn't be a meme and it wouldn't be considered stupid to actually spend bitcoin.
Bitcoin's problem is not value, it hasn't been value for a long while, it's adoption and trust and I think that getting backed by a state can generate way more trust than what bitcoin has right now, and as long as people keep worrying about nothing but value that won't improve at all.

There is a big stretch between "wanting to kill innovation" and "not being sure this is going to be brutally successful".
And by the way some people act around here you would think they aren't that different.

Japan situation is kind of weird and ultimately very responsible though.
The idea is that you can't just fix the economy by bringing immigrants in, as it's being done pretty much **everywhere else** because it's literally just not sustainable.
Instead of bringing in workers from foreign countries to account for the inflated amount of elderly population, Japan just doesn't, that's what shapes a good part of their economy.
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:06:26


This is what I really don't understand
It's like "Down with the banks!" who in the hell do you think would really benefit from this kind of currency system? People who already have truckloads of cash.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:48:12
More users mean more transactions.
In order to keep reasonable times that requires more miners.
More miners means more power usage.
Is any of the above false? Because that would be nice

When it is using as much power as what it is needed in order to power the homes of an entire first world country then no, it is not fine. Its an scalability problem
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:10:47
Which proves my point?
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:07:20
Exactly, it's almost funny how people think this is good.
The economy doesn't even work if people don't want to spend their money.
Whether that's good or bad is a whole different matter, but a currency that punishes the people who use it has no real use.  
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:39:48


To a large degree BTC disregarded whatever it actually happened to it.
If you note the dates of important stuff happening to BTC and how the cost shifted through time, there is a correlation but the vast majority of prince changes is just people buying and selling, speculation.
Which is why I think it could go up again.
@_date: 2017-09-24 19:41:23
No, depending on infrastructure, knowledge and value either can be easier to secure and transport than the other.

@_date: 2017-10-13 07:31:00
That's the funniest thing about this whole thing to me.
In the end you have two big groups of people who invest into bitcoin, those who do for profit (which sadly, I'd say are the majority) and those who do it out of idealism.
And while the second group would surely cheer at the use of technology anywhere else (may the best crypto win) the first one is the group I believe has most control, but also the one that can make it act like a bubble and nothing more.

It's not that arbitrary if your interest in bitcoin is purely as an investor though
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:36:28


Sorry but no, that's just completely false.
If that was true the value of bitcoin would fluctuate depending on it, and simply put that doesn't happen.
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:28:14


The only way that statement makes sense is if "everything" is inflation of the currency.
