yeah im going to invest £1000 i think. (UK) and if in a few months, its over £5000+ im taking it out, i think. im thinking litecoin, and ethereum look good. but its hard to really know. its a risk, thats for sure.

you're right, thats much simpler

issue is, if you have invested thousands into bitcoin, and now its worth tens of thousands, but you hold it, you still dont actually have any profit, as you dont have the money inside your bank, or property or anything for it, thats why im confused by people just holding, as surely the number on their screen says their richer, or wealthy, but in reality they're still homeless in a dumpster eating ramen noodles as they have no money...

how does the tax get paid? will i get a letter or so. and it wont effect my daily job, at all? regardless of amount earnt? i may sound stupid, but im young and never invested. but im in a blessed position where i earn a reasonably good wage, and im trying to learn a little to capitalise on this.

i imagine if i buy it weekly, it'll become difficult and confusing to keep track of every price ive bought it at and sold it at, and then to prove it...

yeah gotta agree, although at some point you'd wanna take more out as you'd wanna profit, otherwise you're gambling with no return, may aswell be playing monopoly, theres gotta be a point where you decide you're happy and take your returns surely

ive googled it, but cant seem to make real sense of it all... also read other comments on here, unsure if joking or genuinely not worth investing, due to tax on my real job.

ive read up on litecoin, and it seems like essentially bitcoin, but processes faster, so no reason it wont sky rocket like bitcoin did too... probably the wrong answer you looked for, but seemed logical to me

i guess if i invested, once its up, id sell half keep half and see if it rose more, as id want the real currency too, so i can buy property/etc.
