Crowmining.com is probably your best bet pm for questions

Lol why the fuck is the link to pornhub?
@_date: 2019-07-01 17:10:50
Dollar cost average. The idea is say you bought 1 btc for $10,000 but now it is $5,000. You buy another and now your average/break even point is $7,500. This way, you can be making profit sooner than waiting for $10,000.

Does it have to be catching a falling knife or can it also be spreading your buys to DCA? You can’t catch the top or bottom. A little here and there as it goes down is never a bad thing.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:15:23
Which is why it’s down again lol. All those people that were excited about finally getting in.. gone..

“And who can afford a $900 bitcoin?”

I’m buyin with the intent of holding at least another 12 years unless it hits ungodly amounts before then. I think the biggest thing is how high do you believe it will go? If you think 100k or more is a possibility, these are great prices.
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:47:49
Or summon some spirits...

My friend almost bought a bitcoin at 4K, and he said he had missed the boat and didn’t buy anything
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:55:31
I haven’t noticed, weird.
@_date: 2019-06-30 22:11:11
I thought they all either made it to their thirties or died off..?
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:35:32
I consider my btc as the more risky side of my retirement fund. I’m good with 10 years or more ��
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:14:55
No one knows- it’s a roll of the dice.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:12:18
Local search? Maybe see if anyone on Craigslist has anyone looking for gold for bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:10:51
I see we have the same effect on the market
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:14:04
Selling is something rich people do in big boats.
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:47:21
Plenty did, that’s why the price recovered fast! There will be other dips though. Remember too- today’s high could be tomorrow’s low, so no shame in scooping a little bit up at any price imo
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:54:04
I feel you man!
@_date: 2019-06-24 02:03:12
I so would do this if my nonexistent twin and I were them
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:21:03
I would’ve be surprised if new ATH sparks more fomo. With this growth there’s bound to be a pull back. For me, I’m holding a good 10 or 12 years anyway so it’s nice seeing these gains, and it’ll be sad seeing the pullback but I just gotta not think about it lol
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:03:03
You sure know how to get ‘em
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:24:05
Is this a new word? Quick, call Webster!
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:14:12
Those are the times you get excited and buy!
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:32:48
Buy and put it under your pillow for 10 years. We will grab a drink together at that time
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:17:57
I saw it at $13 and said “ya fuck this crypto shit.” Boy if I only knew back then....
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:17:18
Don’t sell... doooonnnntttt sell
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:35:59
They dislike him cause he doesn’t like crypto. Before crypto, these people would’ve had no problem with him, but since he hurt their feewings and he doesn’t like the same asset classes them, they take it to heart
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:15:08
Especially my vacuum
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:34:06
Fomo was happening
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:13:31
I’m in the 10+ year mindset too. This is just part of my retirement fund :)

I could be wrong but I’m pretty sure the pi is not also a wallet. I’d go with the ledger. Tried and true and easy. PM for questions

A big piece of fabric used to help propel early ships, nerd.
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:18:34
Ahhhhh yes
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:11:37
Nice man that’s the way to do it. I got into crypto late 2017 too and cost averaging has put me well into the green, despite depressed prices from what I came in at as well.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:18:42
Nice ��
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:52:47
I got someone here lookin for yu

I felt a bit nauseous for about an hour but that was it.
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:54:43
Happy birthday! Glad your poops are normal lol
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:50:49
Indeed. Tis horseradish

@_date: 2019-06-28 03:48:44
And yet everyone thinks we’re done. I though we had all learned to just zoom out the timeline some to gain perspective. Oh well, if people want to sell and let me buy cheaper then...
@_date: 2019-04-13 04:08:57
@_date: 2019-04-13 23:55:02
I’m gonna also assume you’re single
@_date: 2019-04-13 02:34:28
You think I’m some kind of amateur? I wear a saddle for her.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:22:40
Show us your sell order
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:52:47
Bingo. It’s hilarious how many people are shitting on me for coming to a mutual agreement with my wife regarding a $5000 purchase. I’d like to know how the wives of these guys feel about being excluded from these decisions
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:55:33
Both of us but sometimes depending on the weather shorts are an option and she of course wears leggings and the like
@_date: 2019-04-13 01:44:27
Ya it’s horrible. She was like, “I’d rather you diversify our portfolio then sleep on your bed!” (We have separate rooms). I’m just glad she let me eat in her presence and afforded me the opportunity to buy us some takeout. Usually I eat her left overs when she gets home from dinner with her boyfriend. But it’s ok. I just look for the silver lining on things.
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:46:44
My friend is trying to swing like 1.4 btc. I told him to maybe hold the 1 and trade the .4 but he only wants to go all in. He gone get wrekt...
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:57:09
Where is everyone getting the idea that all the money is mine? Lol what if she brings in 70%?
@_date: 2019-04-14 00:42:53
Yup. I even got her to believe that the house we agreed to buy was $10,000! Hahaha! She’s so ignorant
@_date: 2019-04-13 01:41:56
Ya poop tomorrow will be interesting
@_date: 2018-11-08 00:17:17
Did you base that on the one comment or the downvote?
