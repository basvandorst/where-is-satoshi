Just reduce our population 90% through abortion and stopping all illegal immigration and maybe well have a similar chance with a similar government
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:08:04
99% of the population didn't homes before modern banking?
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:21:22
TIL there was no lending before the modern banking system

I don't invest in bitcoin mostly ICOs and I gotta say it's pretty damn fun making 10x your money in 4 weeks

actually before then, the random 25 year old could just up and afford the house, they'd save their 10-20k, pool money with fam and buy that shit outright.
Do you think prices would be so high if no one could afford a home?
Now you just get a loan on a house you'll never really own.

 Nice, I got lucky with LUX too. Now I’m spreading out and hoping for the next 400% bump
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:31:45
Yes, that’s the ideal, but still 10% of total investment into high risk is best. That way you have the chance to turn 1300 into 10000 like I did yesterday than cash 5000 into btc.

do YOU have a sell price? I really think most people here dont. 
And they should

I think people are misinforming themselves that Bitcoin is NOT a high-risk investment. It is, and it should always be treated accordingly.
I invest in primarily alt-coins, much more high risk than bitcoin, and I know going in i have x$ and i expect to lose 100% of x, but if I get an increase in an alt coin of 10y i'll cash out $z and start again. 
and i'm an anti-stock market traditional investment guy. I'm primarily looking for black swans for the limited % of high-risk investments i make (very limited). The rest of my money is in hard assets. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:11:08
he wasn't saying that it didn't make sense to hold, it's just we won't know the value of Bitcoin until we start spending it in normal commercial transactions like we do with CASH
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:37:06
It's going to be a serious issue until we get the transaction fees down. People think for $ to Yen paying 3% for transaction fee is outrageous but bitcoin is way worse than that (or so i've read, i've never done small transactions before)

i think there will be security updates in the future that will cover that and allow people to upgrade. All those coins in the outdated wallets will then be less secure.
That's my logic anyways

someone will do it eventually if the incentive is big enough. It'll be like a Ready Player 1 novel

The simplest way to say is shorting is finite while hodling is infinite as Long as it doesn’t crash permanently
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:02:53
Ah you’re right. Hmm
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:39:59
that's fantastic. I'm not good with investments because i only take the riskiest. I play the market like i'm gambling, always looking for black swans.
Anyways, my brother invests in alt-coins for me. It's his livelihood. His rule is to sell any high-risk once it reaches 10x. You cash out your original investment and put it into something else high risk. So while you may have 100 smallish super high risk investments, if 1 of them goes 1000x like bitcoin did, you should be set. I always loved roulette
It's tough emotionally but, according to my favorite investment book "black swan" by Talib, it's the way to go.

alts are down as well.

How does it work for people who trade stocks and fiat currencies? I don't understand how it's treated any differently.
If you hold for a year you can tax as capital gains
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:15:30
I treat it like gambling and will continue to do so so I can treat my investments accordingly
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:11:07
i WANT it to crash. It needs its cycle, all this growing makes me super anxious. I'm glad I dont have control over my coin investments lol

I'll take the bet. I'll bet another 10 BTC that Hillary doesn't become president if Trump gets impeached.

I'd actually argue that BTC's association with blackmarkets and Crime is what will keep it strong. As long as corrupt politicians and corrupt businessmen (of which the majority are corrupt worldwide) use BTC to hide their transactions and funnel money it will be stable and popular.

Legalizing pedophilia will lead to huge tax windfalls too doesn't mean we should do it
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:04:36
Legalizing vices is always going to bring more revenue, it's much harder to live in virtue than wallow in vice
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:17:15
how do you think the corrupt officials and businessmen in China get their money out without being caught. BTC. As long as their corrupt officials, BTC will remain strong.
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:31:35
we don't have it anymore because sometimes people want to force everyone to accept something so they don't want the 10th, and then those same people don't want people to force something and want the 10th.
You can't have it both ways. The Supreme Court has really f'd up the 10th

and you declare it you must pay taxes on it. Travelling with 10's of thousands through ghetto international airports like LAX or Chicago or Newark is not advisable.
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:44:58
It's not always that clear, if you earned it overseas and you can't send it viabank because China doesn't allow that anymore, carrying a large amount of cash and then explaining it is not that simple
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:26:04
i meant 22% tariff when in reality it's closer to 50% at the dealership in china.
I like how you focused on a very small portion of the argument. The base is China may say they do something one way officially, but in actuality they do whatever they want.
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:50:39
Works for the media!
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:28:33
you can do that but it's illegal, and if they catch you carrying more than 10K they will impound it.
Something I dont want to risk when carrying 30-40k back and forth from China. It's super strict now. Not so simple anymore.
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:38:04
western union is done inside the banks, and this includes all banks from bank of agriculture to bank of china to  ICBC.
They say you can send money internationally but you can't unless you have 'registered business concerns' or 'student going to school'. They're super strict and have some monthly quota of money sent overseas, If they go over that, then the bank managers will get in trouble.
It's actually really frustrating. They CAN do it, but they won't because of fear of a corruption crackdown. It's quite frustrating, we had to have friends lug over 10K at a time just for a gift on our house. Then I have to do all this paperwork and translations. So much trouble
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:19:07
Quick research in to China also tells you there is no tariffs on cars, but there are.
I was just in China last month and the parents were going to wire us 10k to the US but it was forbidden in all cities and banks due to " corruption  crackdown"
So yes the rules say you can but in actuality it is forbidden
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:26:24
Very interesting.
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:25:53
hard to carry around 10K in cash, especially in some countries. Or when travelling internationally.
