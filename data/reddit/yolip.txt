Jesus Christ man, how long you been into crypto? 3 hours?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:28:48
Nobody likes you.
@_date: 2018-09-20 13:57:51
I don't care about the sexual assault or firearms trafficking...but Bcash??? OK, now that's crossing the line!
@_date: 2018-09-20 15:36:26
I'm not trying to tell YOU anything. I'm speaking on behalf of myself and, I think, many people when I say I don't give a fuck about 3D printed guns or the fact that he had sex with a smoking hot 16 year old. But Bcash? If what you say is true, there's no coming back from that, he's dead to me.

Bitcoin is more like Linux.
@_date: 2018-09-25 15:02:31
Guess they're done accumulating. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 15:27:27
You really think accusing someone of being "butthurt" is the best way to show how much you care about sexual assault?
@_date: 2018-08-30 12:18:15
Bitcoin may be around for a long time, these prices won't.

Not investing could end up damaging his relationships far more. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 12:06:51
A 17 year old shouldn't be investing like a 65 year old.

Right now, at near the end of the bear market, there probably will never be a better time to buy. If this guy spends the rest of his life in regret and bitter at his family, it is hardly good for their relationship.
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:29:50
Well that's, like, your opinion man. I'm sorry you feel that way.
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:47:05
Gotta hand it to ya, that's some serious USD shilling.
@_date: 2018-05-15 13:47:37
Yesterday you had $20k in fiat and 1.05 BTC in crypto. Today you have $20k in fiat and 1.05 BTC in crypto. FTFY .
@_date: 2018-08-31 04:27:18
I care.
@_date: 2018-05-26 01:19:00
You're an idiot who bought at the peak of the bubble, what's there to rebut? 
@_date: 2018-05-25 13:27:18
Litecoin doesn't use SHA-256. Litecoin is one of the most secure coins, period. You meant "bitcoin cash."

Religious people rarely achieve the kind of devotion toward Jesus as you show for the US dollar.

Are you new to the internet? The whole goal is to get at the meaning of something with as few words as possible. That's why memes exist, why Twitter is as it is. "Banksters" is a perfect word for the internet because it conveys so much meaning so perfectly in as few words as possible, that the banking system is essentially a cartel and that the high level people in it do not act much differently than organized criminals. Plus, it's really catchy.
@_date: 2018-10-23 16:26:18
All aboard!!!!
@_date: 2018-06-10 16:51:35
Yeah, cause everyone knows following the herd is the key to wealth.

He was just trading on localbitcoins, that apparently was his crime. The US wants to track every transaction and strip the citizens of their privacy, so they are apparently criminalizing the use of localbitcoins to force people into the KYC exchanges. The "Land of the Free" indeed.
When a society starts throwing young, creative, entrepreneurial talent in prison like this young man, you know its on its way to mediocrity.

Schiff is enjoyable to listen to, but his track record sucks.

Dude, are you completely clueless? CW himself tweeted that that was his plan. Oh, wait, you probably don't even know who CW is. Nevermind, go back to your memes.

Cigarettes were once sold as "physician tested and approved."

I think if you are going to give central authorities godlike powers they need to have some accountability and they need to be representational. These beaurocratic institutions, whether it be the NSA or the FED or the SEC, or any of the other government and quasi government agencies, have no meaningful accountability, they are not representative,  they operate with impunity not much different than the institutions in dictatorial societies. We comfort ourselves by saying we get to elect a president and congressional leaders once in awhile, but practically speaking this has next to no effect on these agencies and institutions. And what they do is they seek to increase their power and broaden their control.
@_date: 2018-11-29 15:10:09


What a bunch of criminals, no different than mobsters.
@_date: 2018-11-12 16:10:55
These posts by people who are short the market seem more and more desperate. Used to be you guys would show up, write a few cocky lines about how doomed bitcoin was, and everyone would panic. Now instead you have to write these long winded posts, with all these contorted logical arguments, to beg people to give you just a little FUD.
@_date: 2019-01-21 16:35:20
He's saying even the internet couldn't help people as retarded as you.
@_date: 2018-11-29 17:29:28
It's just about power and control, forcing everyone to go through them gives them godlike power.

Economics is voodoo science. If you could win a Noble Prize in astrology, it wouldn't mean much more...
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:09:50
They're attacking it because they want the price to go low, either because they are shorting it or because they want to buy it cheap. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 15:40:16
More pseudoscience.

Asking for examples of trolling and shilling on r/bitcoin is like a fish asking for proof of water.
