Because stupid people with no idea of how the tech behind cryptocurrency works keep investing in the first mover...
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:53:05
You know what I meant, don’t mind these tiny details
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:42:55
Not going into much detail, i’m not giving my whole list, but to give you a taste: Substratum, Chainlink and 0x (ZRX) are good choices

Doesn’t take away the fact that bitcoin core is completely overvalued
Edit: keep those downvotes coming, doesn’t make less true. Face the facts
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:38:42
It are just names bruh, who gives a damn...
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:10:51
No that would even be more stupid to put all your trust in Roger Ver. The guy is a lunatic, that read a few books, made an early stage investment decision and hodled. But that doesn’t make him an expert. Spread your investment.

It costs nearly $2000 to mine one btc. The transactions take a very long time and cost a kidney per transaction.  Any price above $10k is overvalue, until LN is released and fully implemented.

It's only a good thing when Coinbase starts giving people access to more altcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:52:01
I haven't invested that much, but my gainzzzz are big. Anyway, I exchanged most of my Bitcoin to Dash and a couple of other alts, but i'm not sure if i'm gonna buy back. I mean there are two options very possible. 1) People buy the dip, price rises to Jupiter. 2) Bitcoin is bleeding out and will soon be dead. 
Yeah, i think i'm passing this one, play safe a bit. Investing in crypto shouldn't be a gamble

If you would have paid with BCH you don’t have to wait 2 hours and you can buy more drinks.
LN should have been already in place. 
I bought pizzas with bitcoin a month ago, because that would be the most iconic payment option. The $50 transaction costed me a extra $24. 1 hour and a half hour later the transaction confirmed but was already cancelled by bitpay. 
Still waiting for that refund
@_date: 2018-08-19 14:01:24
Still more useful than a lambo
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:19:50
And change bitcoin to bcore? Lol 
Edit: it was just a joke, guess a lot of people are triggered

Stockholm exchange already had a couple of ETNs. They are BTC/EUR, BTC/SEK, ETH/EUR and ETH/SEK. All fun and such, but not backed by physical Bitcoin or Ethereum

Do you even read. I want both sides to grow up. I don’t prefer any of both sides.
@_date: 2018-05-05 17:40:13
Yes, bitcoin cash is bitcoin cash. Bitcoin is bitcoin. The only difference is that bitcoin is a store of value and bitcoin cash is a peer to peer electronic cash system.
@_date: 2018-05-04 10:19:14
You could tell the same about BTC
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:23:26
It is misleading. But it’s also very misleading, but mostly childish, to mark BCH as shitcoin.
Where is the professionalism?
@_date: 2018-05-05 21:39:29
Sorry mate, but going in depth on bch in this subreddit means risking to get banned here. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:13:22
This is silly. Bitcoin Cash is not a shitcoin, neither is it a scam. I get why people are mad at bitcoin,com , but this response by coincall,io is childish and not a way forward. 
Coincall,io just placed themselves in the same category as bitcoin,com 
@_date: 2018-05-05 17:19:12
Well, at least they have no censorship
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:31:20
Let’s keep a positive vibe here and give BCH a chance.
@_date: 2018-11-17 12:21:40
Does it work?
@_date: 2018-11-21 12:25:37
Well if I didn’t had to wait 20+ minutes up to an entire day to get a confirmation on my transaction, i would use Bitcoin for payments a lot more. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 18:03:27
Nah, I was just asking on behalf of a friend
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:13:59
The wealthy love bitcoin. Banks love blockchain, not crypto. Economist don’t understand bitcoin, because you can’t apply most economic models on it and Fuck the Gov
@_date: 2018-12-06 05:56:06
How am I the only one here trying to figure out what’s in those bags?
