But, what to do with the 45 min we usually spend waiting for BTC confirmations?

Well. What you are talking about is hopeful future implements to the code. All implements are live in drk. A lot of work ahead and how much time?? drk live now.
*What will drk have accomplished if/when these btc programs have "caught up"?
I know. But do you?

perhaps there's another reason you are being downvoted ;)

Your transactions fees identify you. Read the paper, luddite. Passing them through the mixer again does not save you.

If you attempt a btc transaction with no fee, you likely will see the transaction stuck for a few hours/days. Everytime you pay a transaction fee to mix, you have identified yourself as the person attempting to mix that amount. Try going through 17 rounds of mixing btc and see how much you enjoy those transactions fees, your sacrifice of anonymity being a totally separate issue. Its in the article clear as day but if you are only familiar with btc structure its understandable that you would miss it.

*did you read article or post first?

Fees are determined by input size. They are all sending different amounts, consisting of varying complexities of inputs. When the mixer sends you your funds after mixing, since the funds are not denominated the fee can be used in conjunction with the amount you sent in order to locate your unique transaction amount, identifying you.


Good, then you are exactly the type of person who we need thinking about this stuff.

Good luck with everything. Perhaps our opinions will be more in-line in the future.

Peace to you man, I mean no harm. I suggest that your worldview might be a tad bit smaller than necessary and perhaps if you value your privacy you might be on the wrong fork ;)

*good anonymity. good luck with that. seriously!
