My understanding of faucets is that they are minuscule amounts of "test" money, for people who have never tried it before. If they've never used BTC before, they will need to get a lightning wallet setup, which requires at least one on-chain transaction. If the fees are larger than what is feasible to hand out in a faucet, then that faucet can't be run at all. Perhaps it could work in a narrow set of economical circumstances.

Gave up on the test as soon as I saw years. First of all, the notion of "founded" is vague. IIRC, Bitcoin's genesis block was early 2009, the white paper was released in 2008, and it was probably concievdd of some time in advance of the paper.
But who cares about specific dates? The *concepts* and fundamentals are what matter. As it is formulated, this looks more like a popular trivia quiz than a formal test of cryptocurrencies knowledge.

Is it not possible to build a GUI around bitcoind ( Bitcoin Core) via RPC? That's what I understood from this post and it seems to be a perfectly valid statement and needed--bitcoind is solid, but the GUI (bitcoin-qt) is IMO lacking.
I wouldn't call anything that wraps bitcoind a seperate bitcoin client--the distinction is at the very least moot. Perhaps a different client from an end-user perspective, but certainly not from a technical perspective.

Bitcoin and LN act much like a gold standard. Recieving a payment on LN entitles you to an amount of Bitcoin locked away on the blockchain cryptographically.
Similarly, With a gold standard, bills and coins are valueless other than to be redeemed for a quantity of gold locked away in a vault (and therefore exchangeable with other people who value gold).
You can 1) spend LN BTC/bills/coins without ever touching the Bitcoin/gold or 2) you can redeem them to access the Bitcoin/Gold. The value of these tokens is assured because of the second option, and made convenient to use because of the first option.
LN is a physically independant network that locks away Bitcoin, or any other compatible digital asset and effectively trades the keys.

Market cap is an easy, and easily-manipulated statistic. By every other metric--active developpers, exchanges, users, trade volume, merchants, communities, decentralisation, node count, market liquidity, market diversity, reliability (with self-governamce and security), brand-awaremess Bitcoin is still king by far.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:44:41
Chain splits happen whenever a *userbase* is fractured at a protocol level. Miners alone cannot effectively fork a coin because if there are no users to pay them, they collapse. In other words, a fork that no one is *using* isn't much of a fork. A fork without big miners *can* sustain itself with users who also mine (possibly with a EDA).
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:39:39
There's only one, giant network. You open a single channel with anyone on the network and you can relay a transaction to **anyone** else on the net. This idea of having isolated channels or having to open a new channel to each other person you want to pay is nonsense.
To answer your specific query, balances can shift from one channel you control to another, but you still control those channels. If you can't afford to have those channels open, don't open them to start (or don't accept them). As for the economics, well, it sacrifices a bit of decentralisation for massive improvements to privacy and scale. Plus it's optional, so I don't get all the FUD.
Don't believe me? Cool. Get some testnet bitcoins from a faucet, install Eclair, open a random channel with anyone found on the testnet explorer, and start sending payments right now.

Doubtfull. You would need at least one on-chain transaction to open a channel and connect to the rest of the network. Might be possible with a custodian account, but then you aren't *really* using BTC/LN, you are just watching someone else use it for you.

Now here's the $10-trillion dollar question because SSH and TLS both also use SHA-256. 
If SHA-256 is compromised tomorrow, forget Bitcoin, all digital security is royally fucked. Fact is, SHA-256 has been around for a while and no vulnerabilities are known. That makes it battle-hardened and valuable. But a vulnerability could be discovered  At that stage, it's no less trivial to upgrade Bitcoin to another encryption algorythm than other protocols such as TLS and SSH.

Heaters are just fancy resistors, and computers are just very very fancy resistors (they also produce information, but this information "product" is a human construct and is not bound by the laws of thermodynamics). In either case the conversion into heat is quasi 100% "efficient" (since waste heat *is the product*). Other sources of non-negligible waste energy could be light, noise, and mechanical air movement, but only if you are operating a non-trivial amount of monitor and fans, and only if you disregard the fact that ultimatly light, sound, and air movement are converted into heat as well in a closed room.

Is false. No altcoin has been running continuously for almost ten years uninterrupted.

**Decentralisation is expensive.** And a cryptocurrency without decentralisation is nothing more than a very inefficient Paypal.
The **fees are a feature**, not a bug: a market-based mechanism for allocating limited blockchain resources.
We can bank the underprivileged by sacrificing a bit of decentralization as layers on top of Bitcoin. However, we will never be able to serve billions of people by storing every single one of their transactions in perpetuity, on hardware that these same people will never be able to afford.

You seriously think the miners don't have operating costs? 
Mining doesn't print free money. Mining is competitive and profit from reward+fees-power costs is quite small.
That profit is then likely spent on the same shit you buy: food, clothing, a roof over your head.

Absolute garbage article. The impact of cryptocurrency mining is minuscule compared to many other sectors of human activity, and is arguably one of the greatest forces of good since the rise of the internet.
Furthermore Bitcoin mining can be made from renewable energy (in fact miners that use renewable source are likely to be more competitive long-term), waste heat can be recycled to heat homes, or regenerate power. Blockchain scaling and efficiency solutions are being innovated right now.

Your comment is generally useful advice, but your example is unhelpful: the article contains the term "distributed ledger". I think this article is just pessimistic, but not all that uninformative. It's true however that the author does ommit discussing the *value* added of decentralisation especially in light of it's costs (e.g. electricity consumption).
I think the main critique of this article is the author's seeming expectation that volatility will increase indefinitely. This is impossible, and Bitcoin's volatility has been decreasing steadily with adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:24:20


Who? There are no other crypto currencies (with the same level of decentralisation) that are significantly more efficient than Bitcoin's blockchain. People are complaining about high fees in other blockchains too. No, having cheap transactions because you're chain is unused is not innovation nor is it a solution likely to replace incumbents.
**Blockchains do not scale without compromising their fundamental properties. Period.** We will have scale on decentralised blockchains with second layers. You want innovation? It's happening right now in the form of Segwit adoption and LN (vote with your $). No other cryptocurrency is working hard to provide scaling innovation and efficiency.

If it was useless, people wouldn't spend 30$ per transaction. Tin-foil conspiracies aside, no-one sets the price of of transactions, other than demand. If there is no demand, transaction costs decrease and BTC becomes useful again.


**Wrong** We got a temporary capacity upgrade in the form of Segwit in August (after months of stalling, not by the devs, but by the miners), and a permanent scaling solution compatible with Bitcoin that eclipses ALL types of blockchains is being beta tested right now.

Rapidly decreasing with respect to Bitcoin, but not with respect to other things. Constant unit of account is not a necessary property of money, and something that no fiat currencies have anyway (your USD are inflating).

Spam does not belong in the blockchain, and I don't want to subsidize something like SatoshiDice or spam attacks at the cost of my computing ressources.
Fees are a market-based system of deciding which transactions deserve space on the (limited) blockchains and which do not, and it is necessary for a non-zero amount of transaction to sit in the mempool to create a fee market.

Who cares if the people who just want to make a quick buck get burned? That's just noise.
* Why Bitcoin and not some newer crypto with "better tech"? You missunderstand the value of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has the deepest market, with the least volatility, a *proven* track record of being resilient to attacks and manipulation.

You aren't listening.
By your own words, you think the previous commenter said mrrely"It's the original", which alone is meaningless.
In fact, the previous commenter, said something more along the lines of: "Bitcoin has the most confidence in it because it's had the most time to accumulate a healthy deep well distributed liquid market, the best developpers, relatively good distribution of mining (especially compared to pre-mined coins), the most merchants and users (creating the most utility as a medium of exchange), largest communities, and most importantly, the longest track record of running continuously, resisting attacks and operating on a model of self governance (ETH/ETC is a prime example of problems in this regard)."
If you want to dismiss all of that as "mere branding", go right ahead, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice in thinking that the incremental improvements made to the small handful of not-shitcoins out there are somehow more valuable than all of the above factors combined.

Totally and utterly wrong. The market value of every existing thing is determined **exclusively** by the number of sellers versus number of buyers, **without exception*.


So what?


What? 


Did you even read the link I posted? If a bitcoin sells for 10,000$ and you want to buy something worth 1,000$, you send 0.1 Bitcoin. The seller can then hold it, or convert it to USD immediatly. The future or past value is irrelevant, and any price changes *during* the transaction are usually irrelevant.
Again, purchasing power is variable in all currencies. The larger Bitcoin gets, the smaller that volatility in PP, and the more volatility in fiat currencies.

Bitcoin has been running uninterrupted since 2009, despite being attacked over and over and over... And every other attack that isn't successful serves to strengthen its security as its users and developers learn and evolve to counter threats. And even if an attack did manage to take Bitcoin down, another cryptocurrency would evolve an immunity against that attack and take its place. You cannot stop cryptocurrencies. The cat is out of the bag.
That track record as having a proven resilience is in itself immensely valuable.

Is it? People are *still* peddling the "when the coinbase block reward ends, miners will stop getting paid and leave" narrative. Transactions have to overtake the block reward subsidy eventually.
Blockchain is a *limited ressource*. If the fees are too high, people will stop paying them and they will go down. As long as people are willing to pay the high fees, Bitcoin is still valuable, and the fees are exactly what they need to be. For smaller txs, we will have LN.

You are confused with the concept of "sell" and value. Use "trade for" instead. As in: people won't want to trade Bitcoin for fiat because fiat will be worthless. But goods will still be valuable in relation to Bitcoin, because people will always need goods. 
You can confirm that be looking at the exchange rate of goods to fiat in tandem. **If Bitcoin trades for many $ and a slice of pizza trades for many $, then you know that it is not Bitcoin that is valuable, rather it is $ that is worthless!**

$10 is *your* estimate. Someone else who believes in the tech will scoff at you $10. So your question is nonsensical.


Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies aren't for everyone at this stage. Just keep in mind that understanding what other people see in the technology requires you to do your own research. A lot of it. Are you sure you've considered every use case? Not just your own. Talk to people. Do you understand the technology at a fundamental level?
If envisioning and making the first transistor or the first Facebook was "common sense", we'd all be billionaires today. Risky investing is hard work, be it Bitcoin, or anything else, really.

Buy and sell orders on exchanges. The current price is wherever buy and sell orders meet, or somewhere in between if there is a large spread because of low liquidity.
Technical explanation: 
How do people decide to place buy and sell orders? There's no technical explanation. It's whatever people think Bitcoin is worth plus the opportunity cost of holding one or the other. For example, someone who desperately wants to get out of Bitcoin (because they need to pay someone in fiat immediately) will sell at a lower price than someone who is willing to wait to find someone who will offer more.

We're never going to get billions of people onto one blockchain. It's a pipe dream. And that's OK. Because while we can have traditional banking as a layer on top of a base blockchain layer, the decentralised ledger will still exist, as an option for those that want to pay a premium, as well as all sorts of innovative banking applications that sit somewhere in between (e.g. LN) with varying levels of decentralisation and efficiency.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:57:28
I generally liked the article. That being said, the whole "market cap isn't pumped" argument is extremely moot.
* First of all, if you are going to do an average of the price, do a weighted average. If there is a 20BTC sell wall and the next highest bid is 1BTC it's much more likely that the price will go below 100 than above 150.
* The spread between buys and sells in these examples is huge! Up to 100%! Except for local exchanges, most Bitcoin exchanges have spreads no greater than 0.01%. The smaller discrepancy affects the market cap calculation negligibly.
* Finally, the money in/money out argument is a fallacy because it ommit the effect on the bid/order book size, which in turn changes the price resistance.

It's not "easier" in the absolute sense. It still takes as much capital to go from 1000 to 2000 as from 11000 to 12000. Even though the rate of change is different.

I don't see the direct relationship between spending money and capital gains tax. The act of paying taxes and purchasing goods are independent activities: if you spend the Bitcoins at the price you bought them, there's no capital gains.
The only thing happening is that you are crystallizing your loses/gains when you spend them. This is what everyone pretty much expected was going to happen. This has been more or less the ruling in Canada for almost a year now.
In theory this adds more paperwork, but in practice, no one will bother for small purchases.

That's how I would describe on-line shopping with credit cards and paypal. Especially micro-payments.
I am already using Bitcoin for pay-as-you-go-services, where you can make micro payments as you use the service, instead of paying everything up front and hoping the business doesn't screw you.
The biggest challenges I think are fiat&lt;-&gt;Bitcoin exchange and on-line security. I think both are a matter of time. It might take a year, maybe a hundred. But humans will adapt. We always do. I see Bitcoin as the next step in globalization and a natural and unavoidable product of the internet.

Your definition "digital" doesn't distinguish itself from fiat generated via fractional reserve banking, etc. Neither does "virtual" as a matter of fact. Arguably, "crypto" is better, but then again not all non-fiat currencies are based off of cryptography either.
Virtual doesn't imply *not real* anyway, it just means:


In other words, the scarcity is not generated via physics (e.g. gold, or on paper money guarded by men with guns), rather it is generated via mathematics and the information inside a ledger, which I think is a pretty good definition. "virtual currency" is just the umbrella term lay-governments have opted to use to refer to non-physics-based currencies, and I think non-fiat is implied.

What you seem to want is a direct democracy. There are a few reasons why no sovereign state currently is a direct democracy. The classic problem is a technical one: counting the votes of millions quickly and as neutrally as possible. Blockchains are a possible solution to this, but the advantages stop there. There are still many, many more problems to solve, most of them are not technical, but sociological. Chief among them are the issue of irrational voters and apathy: writing laws, reading laws, researching and arriving at sound decisions is *a lot of work*. So much so that your turnout will be abysmal and unrepresentative, probably over represented by interest groups and extremists, especially on mundane (not emotional but still important), unknown, or complex issues.

* No inflation/store of wealth (issues of volatility during the adoption phase aside).
Maybe none of this applies to *you*--yet. That's fine, not everyone is you. For many people all over the world, these are huge benefits.

The problem is that you can't draw a moral blanket over centralization. Centralization is a design choice with pros and cons, nothing more. Those pros may be leveraged more beneficially against the cons of decentralization in some situations, and vice versa in other situations. People need to make this choice according to their own situation. Turning a particular approach to design, such as decentralization, into a religion is doing everyone a disservice.
So stop talking about centralisation/decentralisation, and start talking about risk/reward, cost/benefit.

The point of Bitcoin is to be your own bank and innovate electronic payment systems. If you wanted to dodge taxes, you are probably better off with cash.
@_date: 2014-01-18 19:55:11
I agree. In my jurisdiction, taxes are collected using the honour system (self-reporting and audits) precisely because tax evasion instruments, namely cash, already exist. As long as the probability of being caught is not zero (and it will never be because of human error), all you have to do is balance penalties with risk. If there's one thing governments are exceedingly efficient at, it's collecting money. They don't fuck around.

Sorry, but this is complete rubish (and exaggerated). For example, if you are transacting in Bitcoin, the "Pulling out your phone and starting some app which activates the camera" phase is already completed. No way am I making payments without verification first. Compare apples with apples, please.
The reason QRcodes haven't taken over the world is a problem of incentive, not design:
* For most applications, QRcodes don't offer value add, but in the digital payment sphere they do. QRcodes don't have to be perfect, they just have to be better than card terminals (Interac). And they are by miles.
* I'm sure BT 4.0 has value add over QRcodes, but this is only limited to BT 4.0 devices. How is BT 4.0 going to help me if all I have is some paper and a printer and I want to advertise my address in physical space?
* I think this idea of automatic payments and instant transfers is too scary for most people for now. This 'clunky' mechanism which is grounded in the real world has the advantage of giving people a greater sense of control. Humans have not eveolved yet to live 100% digital lives.

You are both right. Walking around with thousands of dollars in your wallet is stupid. Walking around with 0$ in your wallet is impractical.

The reverse is true outside of Reddit. I haven't run across Dogecoin in the real world a *single time*, whether in the news, a buisness that accepts it, casual conversation, people owning it.

Exchanges aren't the only points of exit from the on-line world for Bitcoins. Brick and mortar stores, local on-line businesses, customs...

A taint analysis later and all of a sudden you have a pretty good idea of everyone's financial history.

I really don't see the logic here. You don't have to be incorporated to deduct operating expenses, at least not in my jurisdiction. Any self-employed individual can claim expenses. If anything, personal and small business allowances, coupled with the ability to "fly under the radar" will **promote** decentralization, and slow down large mining targets.
It's worth noting that this, and allowable deduction laws is all speculation until a court rules over a specific case about this.

Arguably the reverse is true. No one takes hyper-inflated currency seriously (hence why it's so easy to tip). It shouldn't matter anyway. What matters is expected future growth. Hoarding is good. The very act of hoarding is what influences perception of value.
I also question this 'success' which seems to be self-attributed based on 'community behaviour' instead of more objective metrics like merchant adoption, network security, market cap, no. of iat exchanges, etc. Step outside of reddit (or the internet) for an instant and you will see that Doge is almost irrelevant, relatively speaking.

I think people were expecting to not have to because of the libertarian bent. Surprise, surprise! Technology isn't the solution to politics.
Bitcoin has the biggest, most permanent and accessible paper trail of them all. Fortunately, I think that plays to the advantage of the IRS ruling: tracking purchases couldn't be any easier. The worst case scenario is a bit of wallet software that helps you label payments (social payment services seem to be popping up all over the place right now; that's a gold mine for cross referencing financial information with personal information) and, come tax season, dumps a tax report automatically for you. Best case scenario, the IRS doesn't care about your unpaid 30$ capital gains tax.

I don't think this *needs* to happen as much as it will happen automatically when/if Bitcoin is big enough to be used like that. In the meantime, it's a payment system and a store of wealth and that's all it needs to be while it is in the maturing process. Bitcoin is much more than a currency.

~~What? I don't understand your assumptions. How did you determine electricity costs if the difficulty and competition is dynamic? If mining is not profitable, some miners will stop mining until mining is less competitive, at which point profitability will increase again. As profitability increases, more miners will get back in... so you converge towards equilibrium, leaving only those with the cheapest power and most efficient machines, charging the smallest fees that end-users will accept.~~ Edit: OK, this is just for today's conditions. I was under the impression this was general.


What do you mean by that? Altruism, or hoping the price of Bitcoin will go up? if it's the latter, that's miner's fallacy. It's a better investment to buy Bitcoin *today* than it is to mine it if you are running at a purchasing power deficit.

What limit? [This one?]( Bitcoin inflation due to the increase in the controlled supply is negligible. The primary driver of price is exchange demand. See for yourself: over the last six months, the money supply has increased by about 6% (look at the table entitled 'Projected Bitcoins Short Term'). You'd thus expect about 6% inflation, but instead the price of Bitcoin has deflated by 700% (or increased 7 fold). Meanwhile inflation will affect every subsequent year even less and less as supply converges towards the total supply at which point theBitcoin price will be 100% controlled by exchange demand.

EDIT: Maybe what you are saying is that today's price is a repeat of November 2013? Well, considering the price has been steadily rising over the past three years, unlike the handfull of days it took for the price to do the same in November 2013, I think it's a safe bet to say this is not a repeat of November 2013. The price would have to shoot up to 10,000 a bitcoin by the end of February for something like that to happen again.

I.e., going from 1$ to 1000$ is a 1000x increase. Going from 1000$ to 2000$ is a 2x increase.
A 2-fold increase (or decrease) in Bitcoin's price over anything longer than a couple month is not news worthy.
For some context, back in 2011, it took 2 years to hit 1$ from nothing, it then took another two months to hit 2$. Ho hum.

In ten years, it'll either be worth exponentially more, or it will be dead.

Read [this](
Logarithmic scales are more adapted to emotional decisions than linear scales. This is because they measure scales of magnitude and relative change. To an investor, there is no difference between a price increase from $1 to $2 and a price increase from $100 to $200 (ignoring side effects, such as reduced volatility with a larger market cap). Both are a return on investment of 100%, or a doubling of whatever amount they invested in at the $1 or $100 price points.

It's not an issue. Consider:
* A) 10 t/s @ 0.2 $/t = 2$/s mining revenue
* B) 10,000 t/s @ 0.002 $/t = 20$/s mining revenue
B) is clearly a win/win for miners *and* users (who pay 0.002 $/t instead of 0.2 $/t). The transaction fee is self-regulating by market forces and, in a perfectly free market, this efficiency will benefit both miners and users.
New technologies replace old technologies in free market industries all the time and they generally benefit everyone. Consumers might get more performance/$, while manufacturers might get more customers (because of the improved performance/$) or get more product/$ themselves.

**Wrong**. Decentralization is expensive compared to centralized electronic payment networks; low tx fees for everyday transactions were never promised. The only thing that Bitcoin promises is no currency control fees (i.e. on international transactions) and reduced fees compared to handling commodities like Gold.
**What you neglected to mention:** Bitcoin promises to empower people to hold wealth without threat of monetary debasing (inflation) or censorship. This isn't about buying your cup of coffee conveniently. This is about empowering billions of people to have access to banking who don't have access to it today.


You've just described anything that has ever held any kind of value, be it Gold, fiat, stocks, real estate, baseball cards...


Garbage. No one worth listening to advises this.
Today, fees may be too high to buy a coffee, but not to send or store thousands or millions of dollars. Even opening a payment channel on the lightning channel is competitive compared to the hundreds of dollars or more annually people spend in banking fees, checking fees, credit card fees (direct and indirect), etc.


This statement does not follow from the previous points.


Did you see a community of people fighting to use VISA in 1965?


The price is the most tangible (but not the only) measure of adoption. Why? Because **price it is directly and only correlated** with the amount of money/buyers *entering* the bitcoin space compared to the number of sellers exiting. If you care about the success of Bitcoin, you care about the price too, even if you don't own a single Satoshi.


You mean deflate, but I understand what you mean.


Expect corrections. Corrections happen all the time. Daily even. There have been 6 or so major corrections in the history of Bitcoin, where the price decreases rapidly by more than half, and every time the price has rallied relatively soon afterwards. Of course there is risk. But Bitcoin is truly unique and valuable. That makes it a good bet that there will always be buyers.

A myth. The only scenario in which 100% of transactions move off-chain is one where everyone decides to stop using Bitcoin altogether.
For one, off-chain transactions still have to be regularly settled on-chain regardless, and **users have to make an on-chain transaction to get on the lightning network to begin with**. But more importantly, there's no incentive to move all transaction off-chain if the main chain is empty: there will always be some amount of transactions happening on the main chain. Will the cost of a transaction on chain equalize with the cost of transacting on off-chain? Absolutely not. If a user makes few transaction, it's cheaper and easier for them to stay on-chain. If a user makes many small transactions, it's cheaper to do so off-chain. *Buying property from an individual?* On-chain. *Buying a coffee at the same café every week?* Off-chain.
One other thing to consider: miners could technically hold the network at hostage by saying: *pay us this minimum amount or you won't be included in our blocks*. At that point, the market will decide many things: how much hashing is profitable, whether or not to stick with that blockchain, etc.

You should care about the price even if all you care about is adoption. Bitcoin's price goes up for only one reason: when more people are trying to get into bitcoin than out. Thus, the price is some measure of adoption (that also becomes more resistant to manipulation as the number of participants increases). And who doesn't care about adoption? Bitcoin isn't a single-player activity.

Every market cap calculation *estimates* the size of a market by multiplying market price with the number of coins in circulation. Sites like  make the generous assumption that the number of coins in circulation (i.e. held by people who are ready to trade them immediatly) equals the number of coins issued.
Truth is no crypto currencies have all issued coins in circulation. Most coins you will see listed are premined and have very few coins in circulation: these can be held back from circulation artificially to give the appearance of a large market cap. ("pumping").
The most predominant and older coins with a large and diverse pool of buyers and sellers are less prone to this type of scam, but even in Bitcoin, many issued Bitcoins are no longer in circulation as the keys have been lost permanently. Satoshi notably has control of about a million Bitcoin, and these have never moved since Satoshi dissapeared mysteriously.
In 40-60 years, if Bitcoin is still around and worth something, and quantum computing can decrypt today's cryptography, expect a "digital spelunking" industry trying to crack these long lost coins.

It's wrong. The market cap is nothing more than the number of Bitcoins in circulation times the price of Bitcoin. It's a metric to try to estimate the size of the market (in practice, the real size of the market is smaller as an unknown number of Bitcoins are permanently lost and no longer in circulation).
There is only one thing that affects price: the price of Bitcoin goes up if there are more buyers than sellers and it goes down if there are more sellers than buyers. Supply and demand. That's it.

Barring economic attacks, the price is always affordable: tx fees will be paid by those who agree to them (i.e. affordable--not necessarily cheap).
The only question is: *how many* people will find utility in on-chain and/or off-chain transactions.
The killer feature of Bitcoin is decentralisation, not efficiency. On-chain will have a premium because decentralisation is comparably expensive. You don't need decentralisation to buy a coffee and you can't afford it that way anyway. LN, altcoins, or something more centralised *will* be needed for small transactions.

There are fewer people in the middle (i.e. current price) because they are more likely to find someone to sell to/buy from immediately. Orders further from the middle won't find any buyers/sellers unless the price arrives at that point, if at all, which takes a longer time.
Suppose almost all sellers want to sell at 110 or more and almost all buyers want to buy at 90 or less. Both the buyers and sellers will be waiting a long time in line to find anyone to trade with. That leaves only a few people willing to cave in and buy above 90 or sell below 110. The end result is only these people leave the line and the price varies  between the range of 90 and 110 (at whathever these people agree to) until either buyers or sellers give in and adjust their offers because they are tired of waiting.

Someone has to write code and maintain it and solve technical problems. Sure, anyone can write a few lines of code, but very few people are willing to commit to it fully, and even fewer people are experienced and skilled enough to do it properly. Even fewer can truly claim to be independent. There's some degree of power that comes with that. It's a different kind of power than how users drive demand, but it is still an *influential* component of the system.
Of course there is overlap in the groups. Merchants and exchanges can hire developers. Developers can be users. Users can mine (especially more ASIC resistant blockchains) and miners use Bitcoin (by selling newly minted Bitcoins to offset electricity costs). Merchants are ultimately just a very specialized type of user, though they increase utility disproportionately by accepting transactions from anyone. Exchanges are *influential* in the sense that if you want to exchange Bitcoin to fiat, in/or out, there's only one place to do it efficiently: on an exchange, but can otherwise also be classified as a user.
Furthermore, OP/Andreas didn't mention node operators (at least not in this video). This is another essential/*influential* component of the system with tremendous collective power: the power to say "your transaction is invalid!". In practice, there is no incentive to run a full node without being a miner or active user, but that doesn't mean there couldn't or shouldn't be. It also means that users and miners and other participants can be divided amongst themselves and form their own factions, within the same "component", as we have seen on August 1st with UASF and BCH and possibly with Segwit2x in the near future.

Efficiency is not the killer feature of blockchains. Decentralized trust is the killer feature of blockchains. If you want cheap transactions, go back to a centralised database model with companies like Visa or Paypal, or wait for off-chain second layers to mature. If Bitcoin becomes so congested that you can't even afford to get on and off second layers, that's a good problem to have. There are plenty more interesting cryptocurrencies that can relieve some of this pressure (e.g. Monero, Litecoin).

"Why buy gold when the actual types and volume of rocks and metals in the ground is [virtually] unlimited."
Because we've all decided that gold was valuable and that other metals and rocks not as much, and we've *also* decided to keep it that way for thousands of years. Sure, gold has a few unique properties that make it more interesting to hoard over other metals. Similarly Bitcoin has some unique properties that make it more interesting than otherwise exact clones: first mover advantage, the largest user base, by far, with many active participants ready to receive your Bitcoin *today*, and a large ecosystem of miners securing the network.
And when I see unique, I truly mean unforgable. You can clone the Bitcoin repo hundreds of times, maybe change some properties (or not) but you can't reproduce adoption and mining. There is room in the ecosystem for alternative applications of blockchain (e.g. Lightcoin, Ethereum, Monero) just like other metals with different properties find different applications in different industries and some amount of value in their own right. But even that space is finite.

Guys, you overestimate the vulnerability of Bitcoin to a 51% attack. The fact is, this attack vector is very well known and studied, impractical and expensive, and relatively easy to spot and react to via emergency POW changes, emergency rollbacks, or miner blacklisting. Furthermore, this type of attack is only effective on one blockchain at a time--not enough to kill crypto.
No. There are much bigger dangers. The greatest is probably social engineering, especially spreading missinformation and fear to undermine or even ostracise crypto currency users from society, or, more directly, to divide existing communities. Throwing known users in jail is another strategy that would drive the currency underground and scare away potential mainstream users.

Bitcoin UASF probably refers to BIP148 (recommend checking to be sure). Since August 1st, any blocks that do not signal for Segwit activation would be rejected by BIP148 users causing a split. Well Segwit signaling ended up being enforced before August 1st and has since been locked in and will activate in a couple of weeks, so you can probably ignore it.
Bitcoin Segwit2x probably refers to a potential upcoming hardfork in a couple of months. This hardfork was planned before BCH happened. It's unclear if Segwit2x has as much support now and so far it's anyone guess if the hardfork will actually happen. A hardfork is a guaranteed chain split.

The context of a discussion on a PoW change is that the miners have already or are imminently launching a nuclear missile at Bitcoin. Yes, there would be collateral damage, and not just for miners. I don't think anyone is seriously suggesting that a PoW change should be used just to punish one or two minority pools that aren't a serious threat or to curb minor amounts of centralization.
Preparing a contingency PoW change now, acts as *deterrence to the threat of serious mining attacks*. To dismiss the need for a contingency PoW change is to let your opponent amass a nuclear stockpile while you sit around and do nothing but ask them politely to stop stockpiling weapons.

To really think critically about Bitcoin, you have to spend a lot of time thinking about: what is money? what is the concept of value, how does it come to be and how is it determined? what is medium of exchange? fungibility? unit of account? what is disruptive technology? how wealth in society distributed and how is power structured to secure that wealth? what is the benefit of decentralisation over centralisation?

If you hold your Bitcoin at the same address until after a chain dies there is a 0% of loosing coins.

You could also loose coins on one chain if you transact coins on the other chain without using manual replay protection.
The upcoming hardfork is irresponsible as it doesn't prevent replay protection nor does it have overwhelming support to be considered the only Bitcoin. Be very careful with B2X.

gets it. 
If you still think blockchain technology was invented to compete with efficient centralized technologies, you haven't been paying attention. Bitcoin was built to create a censorship-resistant [base layer for a] global, distributed money, controlled by no one but the consensus of all participants simultaneously. 
We will never serve 7 billion humans on a single blockchain. It just ain't happening. We will have to sacrifice some amount of privacy or autonomy to get everyone banking in Bitcoin. But if we compromise the base layer, then no one gets decentralization at all.

I've read the paper several times: people are too focused on the term "cash". Satoshi's contribution is squarely focused on "trustless" money. Cash, or to be precise, efficient payment networks are not original, and in no way justification for inventing blockchains. Digital trustless money, OTOH, is *revolutionary*.
Anyone who stops to think about blockchains critically for a couple minutes quickly realises that copying microtransactions onto millions of computers is one of the least efficient ways of building payment networks. Blockchains are not efficient databases and they will never outcompete centralised transaction services like PayPal in terms of transaction efficiency.
What Blockchains are good (even unique) at is creating a foundation for monetary tokens that no central authority controls, can devalue, or censor. Decentralisation is expensive. But we can still build optional applications on top of Bitcoin that sacrifice some decentralisation for convenience or cost efficiency--and they will come.
Bitcoin is like the Internet Protocol. Clunky to use as is, but a truly revolutionary and necessary technology that other applications that were never possible before can be built on.

Hashes only prevent double spending. Any blocks mined that don't follow user rules are ignored by the rest of the network (including user nodes). Power in Bitcoin is an uneasy alliance amongst many different participating steakholders. Miners are but a small part of that. Miners that go rogue in this way can also be fired with a PoW change in extreme cases.

Don't know anyone that is claiming that, at least in the way you put it... Blockchain--specifically it's trustless, decentralized, censor-ship resistance qualities--is the disruptive technology here, regardless of what name you slap onto it.
Of course, some communities and implementations espouse those qualities more than others. Bitcoin is the *de facto* reference implementation, especially when taken in a historical perspective. There are of course other coins that implement these properties very well, and that add additional features that Bitcoin does not have, such as privacy--usually at the cost of scale. And then there are *other* communities and cryptocurrencies that don't implement disruptive features quite as much, whether intentional or not.
Furthermore, Bitcoin has the largest ecosystem of users, miners, merchants, and developers. If even the largest cryptocurrency community can be attacked by outside actors, then smaller communities could fail as well. Such an attack would significantly weaken the cryptocurrency industry for many years.

The increase in price in 2013 that lead to a collapse happened in a span of one month, and it took months for that full 75% collapse to happen, and on top of that that, the price was still higher after the crash then before the rise. The market was definitely in a nanipulated state as MtGox dominated trades.

I'm sorry, this video is junk.
* Bitcoin is not annonymous. It is pseudo-anonymous. All transactions are public and, by linking transactions with personal and shipping information, can be traced back to you. See for example *blockchain taint analysis*. There are other cryptocurrencies that do anonymity much better, such as Monero.
* No shit Bitcoin is risky, has anyone been saying otherwise? High volatility is necessary for large returns, by necessity. There is no such thing as a high payout on a low-risk bet. Bitcoin is a disruptive technology with many enemies. It could fail at any moment. Do your homework and inform yourself about Bitcoin: both the technology and the politics.
* There are reasons why Bitcoin is unlikely to be overtaken by other crypto currencies (in the medium term anyway) for the same reason MasterCard, Visa, and Paypal are unlikely to be overtaken by competing non-cryptocurrency payment processors: these were the first, with all the brand recognition, first-mover-advantage, infrastructure, stability (relative to other cryptos) and most importantly, a proven track record. It takes a lot of innovation to make a truly disruptive technology and Bitcoin arguably still has the most active and healthy development community.
* Central bank currencies are irrelevant. The innovative aspect of crypto currencies is not that they are digital (there is nothing new about digital money). The innovative aspect of Bitcoin is that it operates without trust, without any central point of control. A "central bank cryptocurrency" is an oxymoron. 
* Mining centralisation is a problem. But not that big of a problem. There are other POW systems that already exist in other cryptocurrencies that are resistant to mining centralisation, and that could even be deployed to Bitcoin in an emergency.

I don't see why not. You undervalue the censorship-resistant property of Bitcoin. I say, that's the only truly unique and revolutionary part about it. 
You don't need blockchains to have fast, cheap transactions. In fact blockchains are just about the worst way of going about it. However, you need blockchains to prevent organisations from debasing your monetary wealth. You need blockchains if you want to send someone money without having to ask anyone's permission first.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:01:43


Blockchains are *not* efficient, and they were never meant to be--they were meant to be censor-ship resistant, independent, and authoritative: financial sovereignty. People need to stop thinking of Bitcoin as a cheap transaction network. Decentralization is expensive and we need to accept that, either through high fees, or through high node operating costs.
I generally support higher fees over higher node operating costs. If nodes become expensive to run, decentralization is compromised for everyone, not just those who want to "stream" money.

I agree that that the conversation sometimes steers to heavily towards name calling. But don't forget, *Bitcoin* **is** *politics*. It was invented precisely to solve a political problem: *how can I have a trustless system of digital money with a predictable supply of tokens?* and *how can I send or receive money without trusting individual people?*
If a small number of people can influence these things, then Bitcoin--and blockchain technology overall--has failed.

PSA: [**Nodes enforce Bitcoin rules, not miners**]( Running a full node arms you with power to keep miners in check, and thus with financial sovereignty--provided people you transact with agree to run a compatible node: this is what we call consensus. As long as users validate blocks themselves, miners who enact illegal rules will quickly find themselves kicked from the Bitcoin network.
The only responsibility of miners is to prevent double spend attacks. Yes, there is a risk here, but it is minimal, since double spend attacks are obvious and relatively easy to counter. Furthermore, miners can be fired with a PoW change enacted by a majority of users (the nuclear option).

The difference between hardfork and softfork has nothing to do with who deploys. Instead, the difference is how the rules change.
In a hardfork, the rules become more permissive, creating blocks that are invalid on old nodes: not backwards compatible and guaranteed chain split.
In a softfork, the rules become stricter, creating new blocks that are still valid on old nodes while rejecting old blocks from an older protocol: backwards compatible with nodes, and chain only splits if miners continue to mine old blocks.
Users don't create blocks, therefore they cannot deploy rules that would normally create invalid blocks (hardfork). Users do enforce rules however, and thus can softfork. That being said, users can run nodes that are compatible newly hardfork blocks. The term user-activated seems moot in such a case, however.

Unsubstantiated statement.


VISA and PayPal are orders of magnitudes faster than any blockchain will ever be, at least using single layer solutions. Is your point that we should go back to VISA? What a joke.


Wrong. Running an Ethereum node is now or soon more expensive than Bitcoin and so will be BCH, if it someday it comes even close to the demand of today's Bitcoin blocks, or if a spam attack would take place and clog 8MB per block instead of only 1MB. You can't experience a scaling problem if you don't have scale.
If you still think blockchains are just snazzy databases, you haven't been paying attention. The only truly revolutionary feature of blockchains (and it's a big one) is trustlessness. Trying to build another PayPal using Blockchains is a fool's errand.

Hard forks are used when the rules become less restrictive, soft forks are used when the rules become more restrictive. Because of this, soft forks are backwards compatible with old nodes, and do not guarantee a permanent chain split. Hard forks always cause chain splits and compatibility issues (with older nodes).

**WRONG**. Anyone who runs bitcoin nodes executes the law. **Bitcoin nodes enforce consensus rules and validate transactions.** A Bitcoin node has the power to invalidate blocks. Any miner that doesn't follow the block rules as executed by the rest of the Bitcoin node network becomes sidelined: thus miners do not have executive power. The only job miners have is preventing double spending through POW. It's an essential and unique service, to be fair, but not one that can't be replaced (at a cost of utility and disruption).

I didn't sign the NYA. In fact, no one asked me my opinion on it. Nor Core's opinion. Nor the opinion of virtually anyone else here. That goes against everything cryptocurrencies stand for. All participants, including node operators, participate and get a vote. 
Normally I don't care that people fork themselves away from Bitcoin (as is the case for Bitcoin cash, good on them!). What makes it worse is all the *pretending* as though these companies represent their users. This is false. The NYA was made behind closed doors without any sort of technical consultation.

There will always be miners to collect fees on the chain chosen by users. You would have to see more than 99% of hashrate leave for there to be one block per day. No way that's happening, not with 100,000$ blocks up for grabs. The only scenario where that is possible is if (get your tinfoil hat ready) miners are secretly compromised in a massive way and do not respond rationally to the economic equilibrium.
In the event of an obvious PoW attack on Bitcoin, core would release an emergency PoW change, effectively firing all the miners and turning their hardware into expensive paperweights. It's the nuclear option to be sure, but ultimatly crypto will survive, now resistant to compromised miners.

AFAIAC, building another Paypal is boring. The real ground breaking innovation with blockchains is trustlessness through true decentralisation. That principle must never be compromised.
We can build better Paypals ontop of a blockchain, but we can't do it the other way around. In the process, we also have to remember that fees are a necessary part of the system, that guard Bitcoin against spam and DOS attacks and reward miners in the process. With LN, users will have the *choice* to compromise a small amount of trustlessness for virtually free transactions and privacy, scaling to billions of users.

Blockchains aren't interesting because they are efficient (they are not), they are interesting because they are hyper redundant, trustless, and resistant to change.

Market cap is an *estimate* of the size of the market *assuming all coins are perfectly liquid*. In Bitcoin, several million coins at least are permanently lost and will never be liquid again. A majority are probably in cold storage, limiting their liquidity either a lot or a lottle, and probably only a small minority of coins are ready to be moved in less than 24 hours.
Cryptocurrencies that have been premined or that have very large single holders are furthermore subject to market manipulation by witholding coin liquidity to give the appearance of a large market (if I create a currency with 1,000,000,000 coins out of thin air and convince someone to buy one for 1000, or sell one to myself pretending the trade is legitimate, I have suddenly created a market cap of one trillion).

Fundamentally, the Byzantine Generals' Problem (what the core innovation of blockchains solves) isn't just technical, because individual *people* cannot be trusted. It's as much a social and political problem as it is a technical one.
Most people still vastly underestimate blockchains. Blockchains aren't glorified databases. They aren't payment networks. Blockchains are a tool for achieving consensus among individual participants. *That* is the true innovation here: censorship resistance, and removing trust in individuals and organisations, and instead trusting the system (backed not by men with guns but by the laws of physics and economics).

Here's a lesson for all you noobs: today's crypto-millionaires aren't millionaires because they are playing day trader. Most crypto millionaires saw a revolutionary technology that would one day become disruptive. **If you're here to make a couple hundred dollars over night, you are going to get played and lose your money.**
Do your homework. Learn about Bitcoin, what it is, what it isn't. Get a little bit, just enough to play with, then forget about they daily price swings. Worst comes to worst, you got an expensive lesson in technology, politics, and economics. Best case scenario, Bitcoins are worth millions one day and you are rich.

The only truly revolutionary property of Bitcoin is it's trustlessness. If you aren't running a fully-validating node, you are trusting someone else (to some degree) with your money, and therefore you aren't taking full advantage of Bitcoin or cryptocurrency technology.
Furthermore, Bitcoin nodes enforce Bitcoin law. A full Bitcoin node not only ensures that money you receive is valid, Bitcoin full nodes also ensure, collectively, that the rules of the network are adhered to by all participants, rules such as: miners can't debase your wealth by giving themselves more bitcoin per block than they are allowed to under the consensus rules.

The TL;DR, and correct me if I'm wrong, is that Segwit patches Bitcoin so that the Lightning Network can be used, which essentially pools many smaller transactions between a common group of participants as one single transaction on the Bitcoin's blockchain. So from the blockchain's point of view a single blockchain transaction may effectively be dozens or thousands of transactions being performed between parties outside of the blockchain. Where I'm a little lost is where records of these transactions are stored, if at all, and if any more mining is involved.

Greed. 
When you enter a volatile market, you understand that there will be ups and downs, but that your overall goal is to come out ahead. Focusing on price highs with 20/20 hindsight is at least an irresponsible, if not a downright stupid, position to take when investing.


Maybe for someone who got in a couple months ago, cares about nothing but the price, and expects to leave soon. For anyone else, this is factually wrong; the market is orders of magnitude larger than it was 1 year ago and since any time before that too, and the technology has matured tremendously, and can compete more than ever with traditional currencies.


What is there to discuss other than volatility? Nothing new there, other than to say that volatility has been decreasing overall. A large factor here is of course market size. Small markets are vulnerable to volatility.
As always, in a bear market, the best thing to do is to take the time to research and reevaluate your position: ask yourself why you are in this market. If you don't have a better answer than "the price went up and strangers on the internet promised me it'll keep going up", you know you shouldn't be investing.

**Many, if not most, developpers supported the principles on the BIP148 side (cause, you know, BIP148 pushed for implementation of a feature they developped), but were against the risks involved with a UASF and its accelerated deployment.

Well it boils down to supply and demand. If a significant number of people who hoard gold switch to Bitcoin instead (because for example it is significantly more portable), then demand for gold would go down, which would decrease price, which would make mining less profitable, which would reduce new gold supply.
Gold has other uses outside of money and also has some pros over Bitcoin (e.g. resistant to lack of power) so, we'll never completely stop mining it, but decrease in demand could slow mining down.

Financial sovereignty. By running a node, your Bitcoin node validates and enforces the rules of Bitcoin. Not banks, not miners, not exchanges, not even wallets. You do.
In other words, running a node gives you the greatest possible level of control over your Bitcoin and the greatest assurance that the rules of Bitcoin aren't being changed without your consent. The only thing that stops a miner from giving themselves 1,000,000 Bitcoin every block (and therefore massively inflating Bitcoin to your detriment) are full nodes run by users.

Gold still has the edge as a pure store of wealth because it will continue to function with loss of electricity and is more resistant to various disasters. However, Bitcoin eclipses gold as a money due to it's added utility and low handling fees, including things like international mobility, day-to-day transactions, and validation and verification.

PoW can't be faked, but, as long as ASICs are around, is subject to collusion, corruption, and centralization and most certainly does not enable participation of ordinary users. So, for the purposes of signalling network consensus, PoW is horseshit.

There's an implication here that this is a very conservative and realistic figure. It's also implied that there's no certainty here---there never is with an investment---but to suggest that bitcoin doesn't have an honest chance to crack 5% of Gold's "market share" despite being technically superior in most (but not all) ways is incredibly, incredibly, incredibly pessimistic. The sort of pessimism that only companies like Blockbuster had about Netflix's innovation.


Weak argument. A response rate of 0.1% is quite pessimistic actually. Just ask any beggar out on the street what their response rate is. Of course, this strategy is flawed regardless, but, not because the response rate is low, instead, because the cost of soliciting such a high volume of people is very high. Same is true for beggars, even if 1 in 50 people (2%) give them a dime (total of $600k).

It takes very little money to influence a small market (today's situation), it takes a lot more money to influence a large market (some future where Bitcoin might be some non-trivial proportion of the economy). Since 2009, the rate of growth and volatility of bitcoin have been decreasing as the market cap has increased. By the time (and if) Bitcoin grows to be significant, you will not be seeing such wild changes in price simply because there will be no more new adopters and no comparatively big market manipulators.
Don't want to get hung up on the definition of "organic", but what we see today is pretty much on course for what has been a consistent trend since 2009: a rapidly increasing price, increasing at a *decreasing rate*.

Regardless of what wallet solution used and political position held, if any, casual users should contact their wallet developer/provider to make sure that their wallet is ready to handle and guide users through any "planned service disruptions" on August 1st due to BIP148 "network upgrade". That's all casual users really need to know.
Anyone using Bitcoin as a store of wealth should be instructed to not transact any amount of bitcoin that they do not want to risk until the "planned service disruptions" are over. I'm not sure of the timeframe, but my understanding is that a soft fork would play out considerably faster than a hard fork.

Yes. A fatal flaw in Bitcoin could kill it overnight. Or the BU/Segwit "debate" could stifle or even sink adoption. Or a powerful government or bank could try to infiltrate and destroy Bitcoin. Bitcoin is risky. Don't invest more than you are willing to lose.


Bitcoin has increased 10-fold many times before only to "crash" a little bit higher than it was 3 months prior. Over the last 3-months we've barely seen a 50% increase. I don't know about you, but an increase of 50% in three months, while significant, is hardly considered a "bubble", even by conventional standards. And certainly not by Bitcoin standards.

Miners are not the only participants of Bitcoin especially so given the increasing centralization of mining. A consensus among miners is not consensus among users. If users are unhappy with miners, they will change PoW, effectively firing the miners. That's another, even stronger consensus. I hope it doesn't come to that, but dangling that threat over the heads of the miners seems to be the only way to remind the miners that they are not the sole or even a majority stakeholder in Bitcoin. They are at best employees with "employee rights".

One of the miners threatened to hardfork at the same time as, and if,  UASF caused a fork. Well UASF won--- indirectly anyway---averting a fork, but now that miner wants to fork anyway. It's a power play and the ulterior motive, by a part of the Bitcoin mining industry that doesn't like Segwit, one that will likely fizzle. Segwit is popular and mature. Bitcoin will go where the people using it go. A mining network with few or no users is worthless.

And then I respond with "large economic nodes are only large because users chose to organise around them".
Miners and users need to cooperate for Bitcoin to function. However, users have ultimate power because users can survive without Bitcoin (or can more easily adapt to a new cryptocurrency or PoW) while miners cannot. That's what UASF is: calling the miner's bluff.

Price/market cap != adoption. Prices are constantly being manipulated, and many coins are permanently lost or premind and artificially held out of circulation.
There is a technical argument to be made that the "original" Bitcoin follows the 50% chain, but that's a technicality that only historians care about.

You vastly overestimate the importance of miners. Miners have no power if users decide not to reward them through transaction fees or a devalued block reward.
More importantly, miners can effectively be fired via a PoW change. 
Let's be clear, it's in everyone's shirt term best interest that that doesn't happen. But it was also in everyone's interest for the miners to respond to market demand by adopting Segwit without delay. Yet here we are.
This is all it is. A power struggle. Ultimatly, though, **the customer is king**. Users can survive without large miners (by being their own miners as they were before 2012, and/or tendering miners that *will* supply their demand), but big mining can't survive without customers.

You are confusing decentralization with distribution/redundancy. I understand your confusion. The two are often used interchangeably in practice.


The second example *is* decentralized (or at least partially decentralized) because not all ends *are centered around a single point*, it in fact has multiple centers *of control*.

A soft fork has been scheduled by some users (hence *User-Activated Soft Fork*) on Aug 1 which essentially says that, after that date, if your block doesn't *signal* [SegWit]( it is invalid, and rejected by the participating full nodes. This is called [BIP 148]( The most likely scenario is that the blockchain will temporarily split for a few hours before one of these two quickly becomes abandoned. There is also a small chance of a "permanent" chain split happening, a BTC with SegWit and a BTC without, but one of these chains will probably languish as market forces decide which chain/coin to back. Broadly speaking, Segwit is good news for users and bad news in the short-term for *established* miners, hence the contention.
How does that impact you? As long as you don't spend coins until the split is corrected, you remain completely unaffected. The split will likely last only a couple of hours, but if it lasts longer, you will probably have to choose between one of the chains (untill you do, any already existing coins will exist on both chains, creating a sort of stock split). Expect more information as Aug 1st draws closer and it becomes clearer which chain the market will prefer.


For a long time, Bitcoin has been the dominant cryptocurrency with well over 95% of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. However, rising transaction fees, and a split community are slowing down this dominance. Over the past couple of months, Ethereum has been catching up. On paper at least. Ethereum has its own bag of controversies and, more importantly is currently experiencing an unsustainable rally. Expect a serious market correction soon--they all do, even Bitcoin.

There is only one reason not to support UASF and that's because others haven't committed to supporting it.  Ambivalence towards BIP148 is the only real risk here. Hopefully, as we get closer to August 1st, there will be much less Ambivalence. Meanwhile, if BIP148 fails as obviously as you say it will, the BIP148 movement will peter out with little consequence.

I know what you are trying to say, but the way you and the author say it has it all backwards. The value of a single Bitcoin [should] have absolutely no bearing on "everyday people" just like "everyday people" don't worry how much the USD is worth in a foreign currency (the issue of static localized prices aside). 1000$ worth of Bitcoin is 1000$ worth of pizza. Do people go around wondering whether a Micorosoft point is worth 0.1c (or whatever it is worth) or do they worry about what 1000 Microsoft points can get them? Both actually. To think about the value of currency without thinking about the value of *everything* it can be traded for is to be asking the wrong questions. Assuming dynamic prices [and that's just about a necessity with Bitcoin and the internet in general], the only people who should care about the price of Bitcoin are those who care about the size of it's economy and its potential for growth.

This is at least a three-way race.
* There is a pro-status quo camp, that is happy with the current high fees, and want no disruption and no network upgrades, at least not in the short term.
* There is the BIP 148 UASF camp that is fed up with high fees and wants SegWit activation to be signalled by Aug 1 or they will start rejecting non-SegWit blocks, causing a soft fork.
* There is the Bitcoin Unlimited camp + Bitmain, a very large mining hardware supplier with roughly 40% hashrate support, that want larger blocks as a solution to scaling instead of SegWit.
The first two camps both generally agree for SegWit, only they disagree on how soon and in what way SegWit should be activated. If BIP 148 causes a chain split, it will most likely be very temporary, as the majority of the Bitcoin community, including Core, supports SegWit.
The third camp wants bigger blocks, which is a radical departure from Bitcoin's core values of decentralization. For technical reasons, to get a blocksize increase, they will have to have a hardfork, which will guarantee a permanent chain split.
If BU+Bitmain split away from Bitcoin, this will probably galvanize the pro-status quo supporters and the BIP 148 UASF supporters together, since lack of a status quo will force the hand of the first camp into action.
It's an uneasy alliance that will most likely come to an end on Aug 1st, one way or another.
The consequence to you, as a hodlr, come Aug 1st, is you will have a copy of your coins on each blockchain, and the market price of each coin is going to split.

A deeper market is more stable as it has more "inertia" to absorb variation introduced by individual transactions. That variation is itself also dictated by the breadth of disagreement on price by individuals. So I am not sure where you are going with the first part of your question. We all expect stability to increase in the long term as the market cap increases, though there will be volatility everytime traders looking to ride the price rise move in and out of the market.

How is that determined? It's really hard to separate speculators and size of the working economy. So everyone just guesses based on the previous price using some instinctive threshold of rate of change.

Why are you putting the emphasis on "sharply"? No one wants unstable growth... the market corrects itself every couple of days anyways. What is important is that the price is almost directly proportional to the market cap.

Users *can* chain split by rejecting blocks from miners they do not like. That *is* a UASF.
Users can do this on a soft fork because a soft fork is a *tightening* of the rules, while a hardfork is a *loosening* of the rules. Users can tighten the rules by rejecting blocks, but they cannot loosen the rules, because they do not create blocks, unless the user is also a miner. Hence why UAHF, is somewhat nonsensical.
Someone still has to mine blocks on the new chain however. That can come from old miners under economic pressure and opportunity: demand (price and no. of tx) on the old chain decreases as some users leave, while demand on the new chain will increase-&gt;expect supply to adjust along. Alternatively, the new chain can be mined by new miners with a PoW change.
Inertia and risk have prevented this from happening before. But there is more and more pressure to upgrade as transaction fees have increased. Miners are employed by users so long as users are satisfied with miners.

Yes and no. If you are not using a mixing service, it's pretty easy to follow the chain of transactions. This doesn't prove anything, but it's enough to draw attention to you, and could be used in a cross reference with some other lead. Furthermore, what's to keep governments from requiring businesses to track your transactions as well? I submit exhibit A: CISPA. With enough leads, it's pretty easy to triangulate your identity via scripts that crawl the public ledger that is the Blockchain and cross-reference transaction with your shipping orders or whatever.
If you are using a mixing service, you will have a slightly better time (assuming you trust that service), but this isn't a property of Bitcoin. It's a money laundering service and if the government feels that such businesses is a threat to security or some other excuse, all they have to do is regulate it. OK, you can run off to another country. How long is that going to last? What's the end-game strategy when the whole world is on Bitcoin and every country is regulated? Where are you going to hide then?
Finally, all of this is a lot of work. The fact is, the average citizen doesn't *really* care about anonymity anyways, or at least doesn't (know enough to) take it seriously.
The bottom line is that technology isn't the solution to politics. It's just a tool that can be used by anyone and is at best a cat and mouse game.

Considering how easy it is to get ordinary shoppers to voluntarily provide their home address at checkouts, I don't think it'll be too difficult to build a database of customers for data mining---assuming an effective legal framework is put in place to collect this data. With home shipping addresses, this process becomes even easier.
Sure, the criminals who wish to stay anonymous have some tools available to hide their traces, but these are neither perfect measures, nor are they easy to use. This assumption also vastly overestimates the intelligence of the common criminal. Even ignoring the technical skills required to hide Bitcoin transactions properly, fiat is even easier to launder than Bitcoin and people still get caught all the time. Most criminals are dumb.
So, in conclusion, I don't think there's any implication (or possibility) to make Bitcoin perfectly traceable and to catch every single criminal to ever touch the coin. But I think there are some good opportunities (i.e. better than what exists currently) to data mine Bitcoin transaction histories by cross-referencing with customer databases.

You are incorrect because you are buying your Bitcoins in hindsight at $1. Why are you doing that?
You have to base the return on your current capitalization (everything else is lost opportunity). 
Spend/own 90$ on/at $9/BTC, i.e. 10 BTC, if the price jumps up to $10/BTC, you made 10$ because you are now worth 100$.
Spend/own 90$ on/at  $90/BTC, i.e. 1 BTC, if the price jumps up to $100/BTC, you made 10$ because you are now worth 100$.

I think the market cap (i.e. price) is pretty damn important. It's an indicator of performance. The more pizzas you can buy with Bitcoin, the better. We've come a long way from the first Pizza sold for 10,000BTC. The seems like a lot now, but at the time, it really just reflected the limited adoption. Meanwhile, I think adoption is important, not just for it's own sake, but adds additional benefits like increased stability over the longterm against speculation and manipulation by making financial attacks more expensive.

Us armchair economist care because the price affects market cap, which affects stability (consider: the larger the market cap, the more money it takes to move the price and the less people will speculate on it's potential for growth), which in turn affects adoption by businesses and the likelihood that people stop hoarding expecting the price to increase.

I beg to differ. As the market cap rises, merchants have increasing incentive to accept Bitcoin, in addition to the incentive to migrate towards increased profits from lower transaction fees. Physically speaking, Bitcoins are not tulips. Not by a long shot.


How many of these so-called experts honestly thought that an inbred economy was going to succeed? Bitcoin has to be adopted by the mainstream along with everything that comes with it, or fail.
Instead, my main concerns with Bitcoin are mostly technical. Also, I really don't think it will change society unlike what some ancaps in here believe. Will it change the way finances are conducted? Possibly. But issues of government and who pays what taxes? Give me a break. That has more to do with who has the biggest guns than who has the biggest ledger.

Even the ISO doesn't go around saying "OK everybody, all the car odomoters of the world and all the blueprints of the world and all the scientific papers on quantum physics are now going to be denominated in meters".

I think a more exact explanation is simply `value = market cap/trading units` where `trading units` are, for all intents and purposes, constant, and `market cap` represents the total amount of wealth people want to hold in the form of Bitcoin for whatever reason.
Holding Bitcoins can be for anything from investment to instruments of financial transaction. Bitcoin's unique features are the incentive for Bitcoins to be held for the purpose of financial transaction over other currencies.

How is that a thing if Bitcoin is the predominant currency? A Bitcoin will always be worth a Bitcoin, so at that point who cares what the exchange rate is with the USD? Maybe it's the USD that will have a stability problem.

I think the price [market cap] is integral to adoption. The higher the market cap, the taller and probably wider the captive audience, the more incentive merchants have to accept Bitcoin. A larger market cap is also more resistant to market manipulation by individuals. Yes, there is going to be some short term fluctuation, especially as speculators move in and out of the market, but to say we haven't come a long way from the first Pizza sold at 10,000 BTC is silly.

Only for the first few. Every additional ASIC after that will provide diminishing returns because of the network difficulty. Meanwhile, you could have been selling hardware at a fixed cost. Eventually, the fixed cost business model will break even and even surpass the diminishing return model. Furthermore, controlling more than 51% of the network hashing power undermines confidence in the currency and you risk crashing the economy along with your source of profit.

That "work" is transfering USD with your bank. If you want to give your money away, that's your prerogative, but in the world I live in, scanning a god damn QR code is less effort than dealing with credit cards or my bank. No one said you had to buy at an exchange. No one said you had to get in now either. Come back in a year or five when someone is paying you in Bitcoin.

This is correct. The end game is to not need to buy Bitcoins in the first place.

Same way you police anything that works on the honor system: risk of audits along with appropriate massive fines if you are caught.
Furthermore, Bitcoin is not anonymous. Far from it. There's a permanent and guaranteed paper trail to be uncovered by paying off or threatening those people who are known to have conducted business with you. Sure, you can take steps to make identification difficult, but then again, this can be achieved with a duffel bag full of cash too. So, nothing's really changed on that front. It's not particularly convenient for people other than career criminals to go through that work.
Edit: It's also worth noting that data mining could be employed to cross reference you and your money to see if it is associated with certain "targeted activities or individuals". Sounds far fetched? Well, profiling isn't really a new thing now is it? All that's left is to change laws to require conviction by probability of association. Welcome to the police state, enforced by statistics. Hello Minority Report.
As for actually accessing your coins, well human flesh is the weakest point of failure anyways, so that's a moot point.

The answer to this question is ultimately an ideological one. Capitalism versus socialism. We could debate this for years and it has little to do with Bitcoin.
Bitcoin changes nothing about tax collection in the grand scheme of things. Extortion, legal/death/jail threats are still all viable methods of taking your Bitcoins as is traditional (wallet) theft. To make matters worse, you now also have a permanent paper trail ready to be investigated. Your identity is a matter of social engineering those you have conducted business with. Impractical enforcement can be dealt with with the honour system which includes auditing and heavy fines. The more things change, the more they stay the same.
 relevant as always.

The analogy is a little silly.
Energy/cost of playing the lottery once != energy/cost of guessing an encryption password once.
Some numbers, though probably not adapted to wallet.dat's encryption scheme and probably out of date:
Anyways, the odds of winning the lottery are always stacked in favour of the house, so on average there is never a net positive payoff to playing the lottery. That's because the reward is determined mathematically as a function of the cost to play. A wallet.dat on the other hand could contain any amount of reward, and it's sum is probably already known.
@_date: 2013-05-08 07:19:34
This may be true, but it is also irrelevant. The point of failure, as always, is the squishy, non-technical, bound-by-laws-of-physics human being. Traditional governments may not be well adapted to the digital world, but they are exceptionally efficient in the world of pathos and physical threats.
Unlike media exchanged with file sharing, currencies have to interact with the physical world, or remain largely irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. So if the government decides Bitcoin is illegal tomorrow, good luck using it to buy a house, or groceries, or the lawyer you will need if you plan to dodge taxes and money laundering laws. If there's something the government doesn't screw around with, it's money. Don't like it? Tough luck, they'll throw you in prison.

Bitcoin belongs to anyone who wants to see an unregulated currency. That's what it was designed for, that's all it can do.

@_date: 2013-12-28 09:21:50
Meanwhile, the incentive to transact in Bitcoin (there is still a lot of implementation inertia to overcome) is the reduced transaction fees (better margins for the merchant and/or savings for the consumer), reduced chargeback risk for the merchant (irreversibility within 1 hour with Bitcoin compared with months with credit cards), accessibility for consumers shopping online, and finally the novelty aspect.
Larger merchants have more inertia to adopt new payment methods so will do so last. With the exception of novelty, incentive for implementing Bitcoin payment methods should increase with adoption.

From what I see on  and from my own experience with a 5770 and a 7850, yes, you can push it further than the "default" by about 25%, but this often results in a higher power consumption, and more wear and tear on your cooling system and card (doubly bad news if you sleep next to your computer and/or have to pay to pump the excess heat out of the room as well). So your net profit isn't necessarily increasing. For this very reason, the revenue of most CPU mining is less than the costs and is just not worth it.

You could measure purchasing power in pizzas if that makes you feel any better. The end result is the same. Today's 1 Bitcoin can buy more pizzas than yesterday because more people want to spend that 1 Bitcoin to buy more pizza. It's inevitable for a scarce resource. That's the bottom line.

When you carry money over the border, there is usually an expectation that it is going to be spent, or at least stay there. Having a password to 10K in bitcoin on your phone (or worse: brainwallet) doesn't mean you'll be spending it. It's ridiculous to be taxed every time you move that password around because there is no expectation that the password will be cashed, or otherwise pergury for "forgetting" you had it with you.
A better solution (for the non-ancaps) is to declare the address. Feds can then verify that the money was not spent.

While this is generally true, it's not 100% straightforward.
Let's be honest: moving money in and out of Bitcoin is not as easy as it should be. It's not a problem with Bitcoin itself, it's a problem with fiat: transaction fees, transaction and confirmation wait times (makes the 1 hour/6 blocks look like a sweet deal), "where did you get this $10k?".

Oh, you must be new to Bitcoin, or at the very least, I can tell you've never mined. Otherwise, you wouldn't be making that statement. Here, you can calculate for yourself just why this is not a thing right here:  The TL;DR is that mining is [competitive]( The more people mining, the fewer rewards each miner gets. [Check out these graphs to see how difficulty has changed to reflect hash rate over time.](


:/ You are just making statements instead of providing arguments. I repeat myself: what constitutes a guarantee of value? Why is 7 billion people--assuming full adoption here--less of a guarantee than an entity representing 300 million of those 7 billion people? What happens if those three million people asked for their value tomorrow? The USD would crash just like anything else.
There are technical TPS issues with Bitcoin's scale and there are challenges towards adoption, I agree there, but that's not up for debate here. As you said, we are debating the viability of the economic model at full scale.

It is. It's the same fallacy as miners justifying their profit with future gains, and people hoarding Bitcoins instead of spending them.

Tax laws are different in different places. The general rule of thumb is that it's capital gains when you cash out, income if you mine (with operating expense deductables) at the time you recieve the reward (after that it's capital gains), taxable with sales tax if you purchase something with it, etc. The specifics will vary, and in many cases there are still a lot of legal grey areas. [Check in with your local bitcoin community]( for more info. I'd recommend seeking professional advice if you are cashing out a large sum of money. Dumping 100k into a bank acount out of nowhere is the sort of thing that trips alarms.

We have market cap. That's the size of the the Bitcoin economy. That's a measure of performance versus the dollar, and therefor also of the relative performance of the Bitcoin economy. That's why exchanges need to be a part of this. A lot of people here are anti-USD. So fine, convert the purchasing power to pizzas if that makes you feel any better. The point it, the exchange rate is relevant because like it or not, Bitcoin is in competition with the USD.

It's irrelevant if you choose to measure Bitcoin's purchasing power in USD, Euros, or Pizzas. But right now, the USD is millions of times larger and more stable than Bitcoin, or the Pizza market for that matter, so that's what we will use to benchmark it. Pretending like the exchange rate doesn't matter is silly. For one, merchants, the backbone of the economy, have to compete with the USD. But also, the market cap is a huge indicator of performance and relevance.

The fact that this form of investment has properties that enable super liquidity might make all the difference.

In science fiction, the *credit* is usually established in the epoch of writing. 100 fictional credits would buy about the same as 100 USD (maybe multipleid by a nice clean number like 10 or 100) just so people naturally grasp the order of magnitude of the unit without going into great details to explain the differences between the real and fictional world.
The problem is that **the purchasing power of most currencies does not remain constant over time**, especially that of unregulated currencies. Fast forward a decade or a millennium and the problem is right back. Furthermore, you can't readjust the purchasing power of the currency after it is issued because all of a sudden, everyone who already owns some of the currency gets screwed.

Bitcoin already enables this. There is no additional infrastructure necessary. The only thing the reddit tipbot does further is to facilitate transactions between users of reddit.com implicitly without rquiring an adress, which is specific to this community. If you were to implement a single tipping mechanism to be used on the entire web, you would, in fact, be discouraging decentralization. Let each site handle it's own tipping system through a common protocol instead of a common third party. It's as simple as including "Send donations to &lt;bitcoin adress&gt;". No need for a trusted third party to manage the tip.
As for tipping journalists, there are all kinds of ethical implications there: many would consider that bribery.

Yet everytime I hear an 'expert' speak, they get some, if not many, factual, often banal, notions very wrong. It's the sort of stuff anyone can learn by reading the wiki, the white paper, or looking at the code yourself. It could be a misunderstanding of how transactions are funded after all coins are mined 


It could be a misunderstanding of what purpose mining serves or of the proof-of-work system...

Yes, we all know that. The important question is: will that be a self-sustaining equilibrium? To be more specific, will the fee be low enough to provide incentive for users to transact with Bitcoin, while the total fees high enough to fund enough mining to provide an adequate level of security? You need a critical mass of adoption to stay within these thresholds. If you can quantify those thresholds numerically, you can probably solve for necessary critical adoption (in TPS) as a function of time.

Christ, this subreddit can't look past cryptography. The method of policing Bitcoin is simple: throw in jail anyone who is caught using it. You won't stop everyone, but good luck spending your Bitcoins at Walmart or any other legitimate buisness that declares it's revenue. You might also find difficulty withdrawing money from a bank to buy Bitcons. Meanwhile, with cash, better hope you don't run into an undercover agent when exchanging your Bitcoins publicly.

The top chart is price using a logarithmic scale.  It's a more natural way of representing relative change based on multiplication instead of summation (compare graphs of incremental addition: `2+2+2+2+2+...` or `2*x`; with graphs of incremental multiplication: `2*2*2*2*2*...` or `2`^`x`)

The only difference I see between guarantee of wealth in BTC and USD is that the USD guarantee is much larger--for now. Imagine a scenario where 50% or even 99% of the world's wealth is in Bitcoin. We're talking about several billions of people ready to accept BTC. That's one hell of a guarantee.

The thing is, I think a larger market cap/price/transaction infrastructure/more distribution will naturally make the market less volatile as it will be more resilient and able to absorb price swings and attacks much more readily.

When I see these posts, all I see is idealism, never any hard evidence or concrete data. The world is a complex place and, besides information, you generally can't add to/change it without removing/affecting something else.
Maybe Bitcoin/cryptography is different, but it's still a thin layer dependent on the physical world where all the old rules still apply (you are hostage to the requirements of power production and telecommunication channels, among other things such as protection from bad guys), so nothing's really *fundamentally* changed. So long as there are limited resources and humans are hardwired for greed (a byproduct of natural selection), utopia cannot exist. It's about coming to terms with the physical and practical limitations of the way the real world works, like accepting Newtons's second law. I wouldn't call that "bending over and take it". Sure, you could *fight back*, but that wouldn't be changing the system. That would just be rewriting the details to suit your own personal needs. Millions before you have claimed the throne of righteousness and nothing changed still. In many cases it got worse.
The world will yet change, but that day is not today, and possibly not for the better. You'll grow old and cranky too. Do not fret.

There are feasibility limits on the number of worldwide Bitcoin transaction that can occur per second. Conventional wisdom dictates that the free market will increase the fixed cost of sending money anyways, discouraging small payments. Meanwhile, the developers decided to guide the market a little with the official client, I assume to avoid growing pains.
bitcointip (on Reddit) is a third-party, centralized, financial service. Transactions between pseudo-Reddit accounts are independent of transactions on the Bitcoin network and subject only to the Reddit bitcointip service policies until you decide to withdraw your balance. By then, you better hope that balance is much greater than $0.001 because it'll cost you more money to widthdraw that balance than it is worth.
This, along with security and convenience, is why third-party, centralized, financial services are guaranteed to thrive on-top of the Bitcoin network. I wouldn't be surprised if we converged towards a Bitcoin network where transactions are conducted almost exclusively by large entities, sending millions of dollars at a time. Ah, pure capitalism at work.

While I would tend to agree with you, it *is interesting* because Bitcoin's scarcity and natural inflation (due to mining) make it comparable to gold. The major difference is that Bitcoin can be moved around very quickly and easily, which might explain how it evolves at a much faster pace.

There is healthy competition and there is unhealthy competition. Since Litecoin doesn't innovate, I can't see how it contributes at all. If Bitcoin failed tomorrow, Litecoin would fail for the exact same reasons. Meanwhile, adoption becomes splintered. Interconnectedness is important for a currency. Sure, you might argue that more cryptocurrencies means more redundancy against attack, but I'd argue this advantage exists regardless of whether people are *currently* using more than one cryptocurrency or not.

Yeah, I don't see the tax evasion argument. Well, I don't know about the US, but in Canada, at least, no taxes are automatically collected out of your bank account. It is either self-reported, or payed for you by your employer, or collected at the cash register at a fixed rate.
If things escalate, the CRA can freeze your assets, sure, but if you are going to escalate tax evasion anyways they could just throw you in prison until you hand over your Bitcoin keys or seize your physical assets as an alternative. Taxmen existed before central banks did.

Yeah, until you want to buy a house or go shopping at Walmart. Even the local mom and pop store has to declare revenue. You can be sure they will stop accepting Bitcoin the moment a prohibition is declared. The government doesn't fuck around with money. Wrap it up in drug money, terrorism or CP, and the population will agree with any legislation. Oh sure, unregulated cash deals will endure. But they've always been there, and not part of the bigger picture. So what's changed? Well, in my mind, the only thing that is guaranteed is the ability to move your own wealth across borders--assuming the price hasn't collapsed.
Is all of this likely? It's up for debate, and I'm leaning towards no. But there's no question that the government doesn't have a lot of social attack vectors at it's disposal.

On what do you base your claim that cryptocurrency will have a great impact? Don't get me wrong, I'm as excited as everyone else in here about the potentials and Bitcoin should be given a chance, but this is still an experiment--it's never been done before and there is no empirical evidence to support anything so we still need to err on the side of caution.
