Fun fact, whales actually have thousands of microscopic legs but once they get on land the sheer mass of the whale is too much for them to walk.

Crypto killed my parents. 
In all honesty I know crypto bros in real life and they are annoying as shit. The whole bitcoin culture is like a cult.

But if institutions want to get in on the crypto market why wouldn't they just mint their own coin instead of buying into Bitcoin? They're trying to make themselves rich, not early Bitcoin adopters.

Bitcoin enthusiasts and morons seem to go hand in hand.

I want all the lambo/moon crypto bros to lose their ass. After that I could care less.

It's very funny to see all of these libertarians complaining about the rich manipulating the price at their expense. Welcome to the unregulated free market ����
