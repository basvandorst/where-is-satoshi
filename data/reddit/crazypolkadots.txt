What is the deal with this? 
@_date: 2018-09-03 18:27:25
Nobody uses bitcoin for payments anyway. It won't matter what they add on to it, but wow, okay.

Thank you for explaining. Krugman is not alone in assuming a fundamental property of a currency is a stable value. I don't know if any of you have noticed, but nobody is using bitcoin as a way to to pay for goods or services. It is far too volatile. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 15:36:15
You better continue to hodl then. Good luck. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:11:32
Do you have a more reasonable argument than that? Just wondering. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 18:29:13
Sorry. I don't get it. Just sounds stupid. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 11:31:20
Bitcoin doesn't really work as a currency, yet here we are building a second layer payment solution on top of something that is already broken. How are we supposed to take this woman seriously? 
@_date: 2018-08-13 03:03:50
It is not that you can't use it to buy goods or services. More like it is really not that useful to do so. Few merchants accept bitcoin, transactions fees are high, the network is slow and cumbersome, and there are far too many better alternatives. Basically, it is has failed as a payment system.

I think the people who continue to tout bitcoin are beginning to look more and more foolish. I am seeing a lot more people laugh about it these days. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 22:39:40
Hysterical: "The biggest reason people don't use it is not the volatility (calculating conversion rates in the age of computers is trivia), it's the expectation that the value of bitcoin will go up so it's better to hodl it."
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:33:18
What's broken about bitcoin? That is all fairly well documented as well, and pretty evident in the fact nobody actually uses it to buy anything. Way too volatile (merchants who did accept for payment, turn it into fiat asap), too long to process transactions, too much energy consumption, etc. Too clunky, too complicated to use. Basically nobody uses it. Now you are going to bolt something on top of it to pretend bitcoin has a future. LN has its own host of problems. The only purpose in all of this is to lure more fools into invest into the bitcoin ponzi scheme. Eventually, you run out of fools and the value of btc sinks to zero. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 00:04:37
Bitcoin is worth a lot of money because it is "scarce" and requires a ridiculous amount of energy consumption. Makes sense.

I can barely stomach the term "Hodl" anymore. Gag me. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 20:23:44
Sounds great. Keep hodling.
@_date: 2018-08-16 14:23:39
You might want to read up on it yourself. Scarcity has done nothing but add to the volatility of bitcoin and make it more unusable than it already is. Real-world monetary systems do not limit the supply of a currency. They are always putting more in. Otherwise, you end up with a depressed economy. The gold standard did not work. We abolished it for a reason. Bitcoin is not like gold.

Krugman is an economist, not a technologist, and the quote has been taken out of context anyway. Dredging up that quote appears to be a way to discredit everything he says about bitcoin, rather than analyzing his statements from a more rational perspective. He is correct in saying that a currency needs to be stable. Bitcoin's volatility is one of the reasons nobody uses it to actually buy anything. What good is money if you can't use it to purchase goods and services? It just becomes a ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 02:39:19
this is an old fucking article
@_date: 2018-10-06 14:32:31
Lol... the bottom is zero.
@_date: 2018-10-06 10:14:19
Satoshi's vision. wtf?
@_date: 2018-10-06 23:51:29
Nothing. Why? Because by the time quantum computing becomes a threat, bitcoin will be about $10 or less, maybe zero. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 23:42:17
Is this supposed to be funny? I can't tell. Somebody get me a drink please. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 23:41:04
I like repeating bus words
@_date: 2018-06-25 23:15:44
Good luck

Ponzi scheme
@_date: 2018-07-08 02:20:17
I can see right away the mentality of the folks in this channel. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 13:12:57
I'm sure this is exactly what Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 23:16:12
Seriously. Grow up. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:14:16
Ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 11:41:49
Is everyone in this subreddit like 15 years old? Lol. This is hysterical. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 00:55:07
Don't think so
@_date: 2018-07-08 01:12:29
Sure, spend it how you want. But people who drive around in lambos bragging about how rich they are is a) childish and obnoxious and b) pumping coins so their own investment goes up

Another bitcoin delirium 
@_date: 2018-12-13 13:10:19
I guess he can always write off the losses
@_date: 2018-12-13 01:03:33
Yeah, but he does not keep the money in btc
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:03:11
Yup
