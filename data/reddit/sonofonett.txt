Do you not understand that the government has to pay money to keep your property safe? Where do you want that money to come from.

Private funding for many of these entities (police, firefighters, military, infrastructure, courts, etc) leads to untold corruption. Furthermore private entities rarely consider long-term and far reaching effects like a good government should. Your position makes no sense.

Pretty much their highest priority is dealing with teenagers who don't like taxes.

First of all you're crazy if you think voluntary donations will fund a successful government, even a tiny, ineffective one like you describe. Don't you think the courts, police and military would treat people differently if they "choose" to donate or not? The donations would just become bribes and money would simply be justice, even more so than it is now.


You don't think a government should feed the hungry? Help the sick? Manage infrastructure and education to promote trade?
Even if that is your view, a policemen looks out only for the immediate needs of those around him, not long term and far reaching problems which it is ALSO the government's job to do. How can the average person or corporation know about the consequences of their actions 50 years down the road in another country? 


We're talking about paying taxes.


Look man, I'm sorry that "the man is keeping you down" but using ridiculous language like this makes you look like an angsty high schooler trying to sounds smart.

Woah, that's a super cool rebellious attitude you have. I bet your friends in high school love it.

This sub is fucking nuts. You seriously think you have no need for fire stations, police stations, schools, roads and all that they entail? You think these things and a lot more that the government does with your money do nothing to ensure the welfare of your person, freedom and property? Of fucking course the government wastes and misuses some money, it's managing more than 300 million people. Could it be better? Sure. Would you be better of without taxes at all? Fuck no.

Are you being serious?
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:32:49
Sorry I just figured out you were quoting someone else and actually have no idea what you are talking about. Have a nice day.

You're joking right? First of all fees are just taxes, but ignoring that if you think for one second that privately funded police/military/courts wouldn't produce the most corrupt country in the world then you are a complete idiot. Look at the world around you! Read some history!

Hahaha, I was reading this and thinking how much it sounded like Ayn Rand dogma so I googled some of what you had "written." Try to attribute your quotes:
Copy and pasting all those words was probably pretty hard for you. Why don't you take some time and actually think about your argument next time? You're obviously out of your depth here, so I'll leave you alone. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:08:14
You're not that stupid, right?
