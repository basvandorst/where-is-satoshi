Surely you can't be serious. 
BTC costs a fraction of what it costs to print and maintain a national currency. 
Maybe im losing your comments meaning in translation.

Oh yeah? 
What constitutes a "good coin"?
How do you know what you believe is a "good coin" actually is a "good coin"?

If Bitcoin really does become a common store of value then big bag holders won't matter all that much. 
Store of value means people hold their wealth in the store of value until they need it for something which generally means a slow trickle of wealth out of the store of value as the cash is needed. As long as btc annually outperforms fiat then there'd be no reason for someone to pull all money out at once. 
If this becomes a huge international store of value like gold then we'll see a much larger market cap with a more stable price so transfers to cash wouldn't effect the price as much. 
If this narrative comes true then we'd also likely see large purchases transferred in bitcoin so there wouldn't be an effect on price since it would just be a transfer ie, purchase of house, car, land, business, stocks, etc in btc.
@_date: 2019-07-19 02:25:39
....... have you ever looked at how much it costs to make and maintain a national currency?

Huh? Look at the transaction and the wallet address that they gave you. That's where your answer lies.
@_date: 2019-07-19 02:42:00
You're talking about dollar cost averaging. Your "idea" is literally the definition of dollar cost averaging 
As others have said, "savings" is a stable amount that earns a small amount of interest but is stable to where you know you'll always have at least the amount that you put in. 
Im a bitcoin bull but I'm not stupid, there's ALWAYS a risk in any investment that your original value can go down. Replacing your savings with a highly volatile investment is a bad idea.

Banks keep about as much cash as they need for regular daily transactions so maybe a few thousand, probably less than $50,000. I've had to "order" cash withdrawals as low as $4,500 before because of this. I use one of the largest nationwide banks in the country in a large metro area.

Sorry, I missed a couple words in there. *most* icos required eth *at time of ico purchase*. Which means an ico would have zero effect on btc price.  Eth is purchased with fiat and converted to the ico token.
Once the ico sale is over and tokens are listed on exchange then then it can no longer be referred to as an ico.  It's now just a company with a token listed on an exchange. 
I suppose btc price could be bumped up once the token went from ico stage to being listed on an exchange and the holders sold to btc?
@_date: 2018-08-03 10:02:26
@_date: 2018-08-14 21:05:38
I agree.  Just not about ICOs causing the swell in BTC.
ICOs, most at least, require ETH to exchange (buy) for the ICO token.  ETH is bought with fiat, therefore ICOs would be the direct contributor to ETH price swelling to $1,000+ prices but it wouldn't be the contributor to BTC swelling.
@_date: 2018-08-14 14:47:15
I love it. Back to the penny coin days.
@_date: 2018-08-24 02:23:40
Ha! That's funny. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:04:45
It makes perfect sense. 
Icos required ETH. You're saying BTC holders had to convert to ETH. By converting BTC to ETH the price of BTC gets driven down because BTC is being sold for ETH.  (Contradictory to your claim that icos somehow drove BTC price up)
ICOs used their own wallets to collect ETH.
Sure, you traded coins and tokens FROM icos on exchanges, so did I. But you're no longer talking about an ico at that point.  You're talking about the coin or token that was given once ico sales were complete. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 01:08:53
Still far quicker than credit card settlement. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 03:41:43
That doesn't make any sense. Icos require ETH.  EtH is easily acquired with fiat. No btc necessary. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:45:44
Yes that is exactly what I'm saying.  
Once it hits an exchange the "initial coin offering" is over. Irrelevant of what the "company" may try to make you think. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:12:58
I analyzed a lot of icos over the last 12 months, instead in quite a few too. I can't think of a single one that took btc.  
Even if the majority ico investors were bitcoin holders then what you're saying means that a lot of btc was converted to eth for ico investment. The btc to eth conversion would have a negative impact on price. 
What exchanges acted as host to ico sales? And how? 
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:45:29
Sure it sounds funny but you shouldn't laugh....

It's the same thing. The btc to fiat value could go up or it could go down.

Wow, you sold the top and caught the bottom of yesterday's volatility huh? You must be a time traveler lol.
It's easy to say "sell at 13,800 and buy back at 11,400" when you're looking back at the chart. 
More often than not, though, the REAL scenario is "sold at 13,800 thinking it would go down to 11,400 and then the price kept going up to 15,000 so i bought back in and lost some of my BTC"

I don't think it's backward to think like this. Sub $10k and people are still scared to buy. $10k - $20k and btc starts getting attention again, above $20k and people think the value is real and will be fighting hand over first to buy.

I suppose you're also of the mindset that "the market is being manipulated".

True but you and me are already in the game. 
Think of it from a new buyer's perspective. Right now btc is at some of its lowest lows since hitting 20k.  No one wants to buy because they think it'll go lower (plus TA says it'll go lower).  Once the price goes up and stays up for a bit it'll build confidence in the new buyers getting them to jump in.
