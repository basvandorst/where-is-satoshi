The truth is somewhere in between: the 51%er can't hack into your computer and force you to update your Bitcoin code but it can hold the network/all your bitcoins hostage until you change.
So there's definitely a sliver of truth in that statement.

I posted the same comment above, but the truth is somewhere in between.  If you've got a 51%er you can hold everyone's coins hostage until they do what you want.  So they can't force you to update, but they can lock you out if you don't.

I guess this applies to me!  I've been around since before the first bubble in 2011 and I'm definitely not a believer in Bitcoin.  I don't think BTC has a compelling business case and has some inherent UX flaws.
Why do I come back?  Well, I am a hacker and I do enjoy reading about the technology and understanding it.  I'm also interested in business and that side of BTC appeals to me too.  Finally, there's the entertainment.  The bitconomy is a bunch of incompetent schmucks trying to make a quick buck.  Here's a quick list of some of my favorite BTC moments:
* bitcoinica

* BFL
* bitfunder
* activeminer
* amir taaki
* MPOE rota
* transaction malleability

I agree, its weird and I'd love to see a discussion between Davout and kraken to explain this.  I think Davout's referring to internal accounting of internal accounts vs internal accounting of external accounts.  Both balance just fine as you point out.  However, there is an issue with the latter - it reflects that the company isn't fully compliant otherwise they'd do everything themselves.  There are risks here but they don't show up on balance sheets.
As for the physical bit - nobody's bringing up physical distinction and I think that's a poor choice of language.  We're all talking about accounting measures.  It's just that davout seems to hold a big indicator in the accounting of internal vs external accounts bit.

You said:


I'm not 100% sure I'm interpreting Davout's position correctly but it seems like you and the OP misinterpreted it subtly.  Note that he says


and later in the post (and throughout the thread) warns about 


So it seems like he's not talking about commingling (mixing of corp and customer funds) but mixing of customer funds with each other.  Note that davout never uses the word commingling (but I admit maybe he was referring to it in a roundabout way).
I think the point Davout's making is that if Kraken was fully registered you could wire money directly to them (instead of to the bank account in Kraken's name) and Kraken would then hold accounts independent of each other for each customer.  So far Kraken is doing the opposite: they've got a single bank account held in their name that holds all customer funds which is opened in Kraken's name.  In other words Kraken would be the bank-like entity and not be the customer of a bank-like entity.
At any rate I'd appreciate clarification from both sides because I'm pretty out of my league here. :)

You're kinda being vague here when you just use the word "attack" so there isn't a whole lot for anyone to respond to.  However, for the most part these big-picture vulnerabilities need to be countered with the design of Bitcoin itself, going back to the original paper.  If it turns out Satoshi missed something and Bitcoin gets destroyed, oh well.  Time for Bitcoin 2.0 to learn from the mistakes.
Additionally Bitcoin proponents have rejected any attempt at centralization or some kind of social control that sits on top of the network (People propose a way to block spending of stolen coins all the time, it will never happen).  This mindset limits what the community is willing to do in order to protect the blockchain.  Either Bitcoin as it's set up now will work or it won't.

However, with rejecting these evil blocks you need what i was referring to as social control in my first post - someone has to make the call about who is evil.  Bitcoiners are pretty set on not letting anyone hold this hat, even someone uncontroversial like Gavin (the effective lead Bitcoin programmer).  So, any solutions that require someone to make a judgment call about something that can't be decided through software means are never going to be implemented.

There are diminishing returns on how much you can raise through equity alone.  Eventually investors are going to find your equity too risky and won't buy it.  There's also always going to be a large demand for reliable, dependable bonds - if there's a market thirsting for bonds why wouldn't a business sell to it?  Imagining a future where everyone only uses equity to finance themselves is hopelessly naive.

Deepbit commented on the forum that some of the blocks "found" by Zurich were Deepbit blocks.  Blockchain.info reports the finder of the block as whoever sent it to them first.  What's happening here is that Zurich is forwarding the blocks to blockchain.info faster than other mining pools, not that Zurich has a giant mining farm.
As for the 51% attack - you shrug your shoulders and say "Oh well."  Sure, it's possible that the devs could distribute a new client that forces a new, recent checkpoint to get around someone's block but that would basically kill Bitcoin.  The system was designed with the assumption that a 51% is too hard to pull off.  If someone does it you say "Oh well, so much for Bitcoin."  That's the reason why the fallout from a 51% attack seems so scary - Satoshi wasn't interested in guarding against it with the protocol, he's hoping that the economics will keep it from happening.

It's likely that Pirate's bank run^[1] was spurred on by people wanting to sell in the face of the growing price this week.  If pirate returns deposits they may still want to move out of BTC, thinking the current price is still in a bubble.  It's all speculation though, if Pirate pays everyone back they'll be a lot of liquidity all around and who knows where it'll go.

It gets deposited every day I think.  IIRC there was a minimum payout of one cent or something like that, so you need to calculate your int rate to see if you're below that.  If you are below that rate you can still get interest on the days when they really need the money and int rates swing really high briefly.  It won't be much though.
@_date: 2012-09-15 22:28:05
Well, this is just my opinion so I could easily be wrong one day.  In order to get any long-term profit the Bitcoin economy has to grow a lot.  This isn't guaranteed by any means, and looking at Bitcoin's past I don't think it will come.
Remember the big Bitcoin news and bubble last summer?  That put Bitcoin front and center for a few days/a week many places all over the web.  Bitcoin was also heavily discussed among techies who are the crucial early adopters that Bitcoin needs to recruit.  Techies can see through poor software and businesses and detect the underlying potential in Bitcoin.  Last summer all the publicity put Bitcoin under the microscope for techies everywhere and they walked away with a resounding "meh", "it's a scam" or "it's a terrible idea."  Bitcoin had its chance to win over early adopters and it blew it.
Secondly, Bitcoin is a businessman's dream.  Seriously - there's a very unregulated market here and it's a developing market which means that you can make money hand over fist.  Where are the killer Bitcoin businesses?  All there is after a year or two is a giant ponzi scheme and a few frequently-hacked exchanges.  Not only has Bitcoin been shunned by techies it's being ignored by businessmen too.  Something's very wrong with Bitcoin - I won't speculate as to what exactly - but it's bad enough to keep businesses from starting and that's fatal.

Well, the "mining is no longer profitable" is a generalization.  Mining has to be profitable for someone otherwise they'd turn off their rigs.  Mining is basically a race to the bottom: who can run the biggest operations with the cheapest electricity on the most efficient hardware with the lowest overhead.  That person is the winner.


Hey, there's still risk here.  That's not guaranteed in the slightest.


The gain is calculated as the selling price in a year (say $20) minus what you paid to get it originally.   If you bought BTC for $11 and sold it for $20, you made a $9 gain.  If you're mining at a loss and spent $12 in electricity to mine a $11 bitcoin your gain is $8 ($20-$12).  A rational person will never mine at a loss as they make more profit by shutting down and just buying coins.


You are helping the blockchain become decentralized, however that's not really what the Bitcoin needs right now.  Also, if you've got a profit motive mining doesn't increase the price.  Bitcoin's good on miners, it really needs an economy.  Opening a business is how you'd best make an investment in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-08-06 05:27:45
No, that's the thing - Kaminsky shows that over time it becomes so expensive to maintain a mining node that only large businesses (possibly only ones who can mine at a loss) can participate in a network.  Remember that miners decide what transactions get included in a block.  Imagine a future where 10 or so big banks are the only miners on the network because it's too expensive for anyone else to keep up with the transaction level.  Do you really trust that they're not going to use their oligopoly powers to exclude Bitcoin transactions from people who aren't their paying customers?  Do you really think that a bank big enough that it only has 10-20 competitors of its size worldwide can escape government regulation and scrutiny?
Bitcoin needs the decentralization in order to guarantee a network like we have it today.  If Bitcoin gets big it will no longer be like the network we have today.
@_date: 2012-08-19 20:26:10
That's not a sale of 100k bitcoins, it's a transaction of 100k bitcoins within the Bitcoin network.  It's probably just someone moving their coins around.

I'd like to point out to anyone answering Enigma's question that because of Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature all transactions need to be laundered (not just the illegal ones).  A lot of people might not launder coins for person-to-person sales but the two largest Bitcoin businesses (Mt. Gox and Silk Road) do.  Any exchange that involves either business will result in multiple transactions in the blockchain.

The bank can get more coins from other lenders.  They could issue bonds on GLBSE.
I agree that because of the lack of a central bank that bank runs are riskier/more likely in BTC but that's outside of what we've been discussing here - we've been arguing whether fractional reserve is possible, not if it won't happen because risk is high.
@_date: 2012-08-04 20:00:56
Note that a modern bank loaning out more than it has deposits is still getting that money from somewhere else (the central bank or something).  At that point it becomes better to look at the total balance sheet than just customer deposits and your 100% of deposits is a meaningless number.  So, a Bitcoin bank could still loan out more than its deposits, it just has to take on more liabilities from non-deposit sources.  Also, there's risk from their assets losing value but ceteris paribus.
Anyway, here's how a regular bank works:
* Customers deposit money
* The bank uses the money to buy bonds and other investments
* The bank bets on only a few people at a time coming to withdraw all their money
And here's how a Bitcoin bank works:
* Customers deposit bitcoins
* The Bitcoin bank buys GLBSE bonds and other investments
* The Bitcoin bank bets on only a few people at a time coming to withdraw all their money
Both systems have the exact same bank run risk and reward.  Fractional reserve banking is just as possible in Bitcoin.  You might be confusing banking with some kind of online wallet service.  Right now what we have with Mt.Gox could easily be adapted to fractional reserve (although I'm sure they don't want to go in that direction at this time).  I've actually seen someone else in your shoes here on this subreddit - they were convinced you couldn't implement it in Bitcoin but changed their minds after actually learning what fractional reserve banking is.
@_date: 2012-01-10 23:28:51
The design of any system used to control the keys falls under internal controls by definition.  It doesn't matter that bitcoins are a new thing, the field is broad enough and enough freedom is given to accountants to tackle the kind of risk inherent in bitcoins.  There are lots of fields with new, unusual and risky things going on that need special internal controls.  Bitcoin isn't unique.
I'd also like to address your statement about walking out the door with codes.  Businesses already keep critical information about their operations and customer's private information in their computer systems.  The same businesses also take steps to make sure that information doesn't walk out the door.  What makes you think bitcoin keys can't be controlled like that data?
(n.b. I know internal controls aren't perfect, T.J. Maxx, etc.)

Cumulative: This makes more sense if you scoot down the chart to the left.  It's the number of coins that have to be sold in order to push the current market price down to that level.  The number is small in your screenshot because you picked a spot close to the current market price.
Liquidity: The cumulative amount of currency that's in the bid order book up to that point.
The cumulative bits of the above answers mean that if you walk into the market with a lot of BTC and start selling the price per bitcoin that you're getting will go down depending on what orders you're fulfilling on the book.  The sums take this slippage into account.

That was an estimate for the bitcoins kept on hand for GLBSE itself.  The number for actual deposits from customers is much higher, it's just that those bitcoins are quickly routed through GLBSE to the stock/bond issuer.

I think jgarzik had a reading comprehension problem here.  It was clear to me after reading the paper that "users" could be a business or an individual - it referred to a single controlling entity, not a natural person.  They even went and named MtGox and Deepbit as examples of "users" and both are clearly not a single person.
The most damning statistic in that paper (and the one not being talked about at all) is that there are only 75 active users/businesses of the blockchain with any kind of volume - and that's a liberal estimate!

Yes, but the supply side is known to all participants (it's usually something you learn in your first 5 minutes of Bitcoin).  It's already been priced in.  Did you read the one academic paper posted to this subreddit a few days ago?  They ignored supply entirely for this reason.
That means demand is the only thing left.  There have only been two successful bitcoin businesses of any size (Silk Road, Bitcoinica) and one of those closed a few months ago.  Silk Road sure as hell isn't responsible for the hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins in volume on the volatile days that move the Bitcoin price up leaving it to speculators.

You're totally off the mark.  Here's a really quick rundown on finance. 
Here are the two ways you make money off of equity:
* You sell the stock for a profit
* You get dividends
Imagine you get in on the ground floor with an IPO.  Things are already a bit risky - you're counting that you'll be able to sell it for more (demand will grow up, not always guaranteed, see FB!) and that the company will pay dividends at some point in the future.  Remember that dividend checks depend on how well the company does which depends on a whole lot of things.
So, that's the most basic risk for investing in equity.  What minorman was suggesting was that companies would get everything through equity - every time they needed any investments they would issue more equity.  You can do this, but you can't continually do this as it pisses off your equity investors and increases their risk.  Remember the two ways you profit off of equity up above?  When you issue more equity, you destroy  because you're increasing supply and you increase investor fear ("If all he ever does is sell equity this will only get more worthless over time!").  Also, by diluting stocks you reduce the proportional dividend paycheck.  So, you're stacking risk on top of the basic risk above and this risk increases with every new bit of equity issued.
So, this is the reason why minorman is basically spreading a totally unrealistic fantasy: his scenario just makes everyone's investments worse and worse and worse and makes everyone angry.
In order to combat this problem management decides on a capital structure: the proportion and types of debt to take on so that they don't just pump out stock all the time.  You swing back and forth between debt and equity to basically reassure investors you're not going to obliterate their equity investment.  Yes, equity is easy money for corporations - no guaranteed dividend payments! - but you can't do it forever for the reasons stated above..


You're totally off the mark here too.  Companies issue bonds all the time.  You've got a bit of understanding when you likened them to loans - bonds are just tiny loans - but big companies (and governments!) issue bonds all the time.  Bonds are almost always less risky for the investor because they have a guaranteed payment written into the contract.  However, a company can't finance itself entirely with bonds, these mandatory bond payments can get too big and it'll go under.  That's the story behind capital structure: you don't swing too much in one direction as that ruins your company.
Some advice: Take a finance class or two.  Also, not calling you out specifically but there are a lot of people in this thread calling debt "evil."  Stop ascribing human emotions to non-human things!  It's just a tool.  Start thinking about things in term of risk: Debt has controlled risk at the start but as you take on more and more the risk increases.  Frame everything in the context of risk!
Edit: if you're looking to start a conversation here go ahead and ask any questions!  I'll give a shot at answering them.
@_date: 2012-08-04 00:50:32
Well, the commenter doesn't understand how mining works.  It can't be tiered like the Internet.  Miners need to store the entire blockchain and keep it up to date - those are the prohibitive costs that Kaminsky talks about in his talk.
The "lite clients" that only operate on headers aren't really part of the blockchain and thus don't count towards decentralization.
Anecdotally, the Internet isn't really a great example - it's not the Wild West, decentralized network that people like to romantically imagine it as.  It's entirely dependent on large corporations subject to heavy government regulation.  See the Darknet stuff on Reddit for what an Internet that is properly decentralized looks like - it sucks.  Badly.  It's nothing like the Internet we've all come to know and love.
Also, I'm glad to see at least someone else is thinking critically about Bitcoin.  Thanks for asking questions!

Warning: uninformed opinion of a clueless amateur here.
If MtGox still has dark pool trading it could be public orders being filled by dark pool bids.  MtGox could report that transaction at its price but give a volume of 0 as to not give away information about the size of the dark pool.  The zigzag would be buys and sells bouncing between bid walls on the dark pool.
This would kinda make sense with the recent spike in bitcoin price: large btc holders could be wanting to cash out at the recent highs without crashing the price.

Yes, but people have been manually sorting spam vs not spam for over a decade now so there are lots of examples.  With gmail they've leveraged their millions of users and billions of emails to greatly improve their statistical model.  It's not really a problem.

Businesses only respect these agreements because they know courts will enforce them.  Even then arbitration isn't pixie dust, it can be thrown out by courts as well.  In fact, arbitration is a really shitty business and legal strategy - why spend money on arbitration + the possibility of a second lawsuit when you could spend money on just a lawsuit and get a public, enforceable record that can be reused in future conflicts and will almost certainly not get overturned?

Nothing.  Bitcoin can't be completely destroyed (there will always be some cockroaches surviving the nuke) but it can be encumbered enough to make it worthless as a currency for most people.

Miner expenses don't have anything to do with difficulty or the number of transactions in a block.  Transaction costs will go up in the short term because we'll run out of block space and go up in the long term because miners will have to charge users the real cost of their expenses.  Bitcoin is expensive to run and the transaction cost will reflect that.
The scarce resource is the size of the UTXO set and not the CPU time needed to verify transactions.  Mining is also totally independent of transaction verifying (it seems you confused the two with "increased difficulty shows the surplus power available").

The oldest order in the order queue.  Lag of 50 minutes means that 50 minutes ago someone placed an order to buy or sell and it still hasn't been filled.  Lag makes no promise about how long it will take you to fill an order if you placed it right now.

The biggest problems here aren't on the implementation side but the capital, economic and business side.
Transportation benefits greatly from economies of scale.  The existing services are worldwide and are established and you'll never beat them on cost.  So, only people who absolutely need anonymity are going to pay your premium for it.  In addition to that the heavily segmented transportation your plan calls for is going to make things very expensive.  Few users of a system also has a negative impact on the level of anonymity you're able to provide.
If your prices get too high you'll be cannibalized by people just traveling by themselves and using dead drops to create anonymity.  If an enterprise needs to push product in bulk it'll be cheaper for them to go the drug dealer network route.  And finally for letters and similar things you'll never win market share away from PGP and Tor.
One way of implementing your system is to have small, regional dead drop kiosk type things for both shippers and receivers.  However, this is very, very capital intensive - in order for them to be useful they've got to be plentiful (to preserve anonymity) and physical, two things that will drive the capital needed through the roof.
So your target market is sparse, doesn't use the system frequently, doesn't ship in bulk and doesn't use it for letters.  I'm not saying you can't make it work but the target market may just be too damn small.

Spam has a solution: bayesian filtering.  It's been working great since the early 2000s.  There's a reason why the onslaught of spam prevention ideas that drove the creation of the above copypasta died around the release of gmail - a solution was found and everyone moved on.
edit: not saying that gmail introduced bayesian filtering, it just put the nail in the coffin for the debate over what tactic to use.

Time to break out the old copypasta!
    Your post advocates a
    ( ) technical ( ) legislative (X) market-based ( ) vigilante
    approach to fighting spam. Your idea will not work. Here is why it won't work.
    (One or more of the following may apply to your particular idea, and it may have other
    flaws which used to vary from state to state before a bad federal law was passed.)
    ( ) Spammers can easily use it to harvest email addresses
    (X) Mailing lists and other legitimate email uses would be affected
    ( ) No one will be able to find the guy or collect the money
    ( ) It is defenseless against brute force attacks
    (X) It will stop spam for two weeks and then we'll be stuck with it
    (X) Users of email will not put up with it
    (X) Microsoft will not put up with it
    ( ) The police will not put up with it
    (X) Requires too much cooperation from spammers
    (X) Requires immediate total cooperation from everybody at once
    (X) Many email users cannot afford to lose business or alienate potential employers
    ( ) Spammers don't care about invalid addresses in their lists
    (X) Anyone could anonymously destroy anyone else's career or business
    Specifically, your plan fails to account for
    ( ) Laws expressly prohibiting it
    ( ) Lack of centrally controlling authority for email
    ( ) Open relays in foreign countries
    ( ) Ease of searching tiny alphanumeric address space of all email addresses
    (X) Asshats
    ( ) Jurisdictional problems
    (X) Unpopularity of weird new taxes
    (X) Public reluctance to accept weird new forms of money
    ( ) Huge existing software investment in SMTP
    ( ) Susceptibility of protocols other than SMTP to attack
    ( ) Willingness of users to install OS patches received by email
    ( ) Armies of worm riddled broadband-connected Windows boxes
    ( ) Eternal arms race involved in all filtering approaches
    (X) Extreme profitability of spam
    ( ) Joe jobs and/or identity theft
    ( ) Technically illiterate politicians
    ( ) Extreme stupidity on the part of people who do business with spammers
    ( ) Dishonesty on the part of spammers themselves
    ( ) Bandwidth costs that are unaffected by client filtering
    (X) Outlook
    and the following philosophical objections may also apply:
    (X) Ideas similar to yours are easy to come up with, yet none have ever been shown practical
    ( ) Any scheme based on opt-out is unacceptable
    ( ) SMTP headers should not be the subject of legislation
    ( ) Blacklists suck
    ( ) Whitelists suck
    ( ) We should be able to talk about Viagra without being censored
    ( ) Countermeasures should not involve wire fraud or credit card fraud
    ( ) Countermeasures should not involve sabotage of public networks
    (X) Countermeasures must work if phased in gradually
    (X) Sending email should be free
    ( ) Why should we have to trust you and your servers?
    ( ) Incompatibility with open source or open source licenses
    ( ) Feel-good measures do nothing to solve the problem
    ( ) Temporary/one-time email addresses are cumbersome
    ( ) I don't want the government reading my email
    ( ) Killing them that way is not slow and painful enough
    Furthermore, this is what I think about you:
    ( ) Sorry dude, but I don't think it would work.
    (X) This is a stupid idea, and you're a stupid person for suggesting it.
    ( ) Nice try, assh0le! I'm going to find out where you live and burn your house down!

You don't have to realize gains in dollars for them to be taxable.  If the IRS turned a blind eye to those transactions why would anyone ever pay taxes?  It would be absolutely trivial to pay nothing.  Your parent's coffeeshop example is correct (barring specifics).

The time value of money is like Newton's laws of finance, you don't get to pick and choose how it applies, it just is.  All financial systems have to deal with it.


Are you comparing the overnight Fed rates to the rates given to banks to the rates handed out from banks to customers?  The Fed only has a handful of customers which are all large, well-capitalized, yearly audited businesses which employ the best minds in finance.  On the other hand loaning to hundreds of thousands of individuals requires an extensive bureaucracy to evaluate creditworthiness and even then they don't get it right all of the time.  The two loan programs are completely incomparable.

It's used to initialize the random number generator.  If you take a look at   you can see how one is used.  Normally it's gathered from the timing of interrupts on a PC and some other sources.  On an embedded device I can see how it becomes tricky to find a good source for seeds.  There are hardware random number generators that can mitigate this though so it reflects very, very, very poorly on the hardware manufacturer if they didn't bother to include one.

Sorta but not really because it can be easily gamed by someone sending money to themselves, consolidating wallets and such.  In an idealized world where everyone launders their bitcoins in order to keep their anonymity the volume is artificially multiplied by a lot.

But how is he not supporting Bitcoin by doing this?  MtGox isn't the molten heart of Bitcoin and as far as I can tell everyone wants it dead anyway.
Although we can't be positively certain it is very likely that the contract in exhibit A is valid and MtGox has violated it by not allowing access to the database among other things.  From this perspective you have the big, bad MtGox throwing its weight around and ignoring the contract signed with Peter, the little guy.  It's not the most beneficial thing imaginable but it's still defending the community - he's still trying to create a usable exchange within the United States and MtGox (despite having signed a contract to do so) is obstructing him.
tl;dr you say "the potential profit became more important than supporting Bitcoin" but from another perspective Peter is still supporting Bitcoin.

It's not about the revenue of his company, it's about the MtGox revenue that he would have access to over the next 10 years according to the contract.  I just went to Bitcoin Charts and eyeballed the Volume As Currency chart - I'd say the average volume in USD a day since April 1 is around $15 million.  $15m * .007 starting fee * 30 = 3m revenue in a month.  If Bitcoin doesn't die in a year or two his $75m is reasonable and if it winds up taking over the world $75m is was too small.
@_date: 2013-03-12 03:26:07
Litecoin is just as affected by this as Bitcoin is.  It's only been exposed on Bitcoin because of the higher volume of Bitcoin blockchain use.
