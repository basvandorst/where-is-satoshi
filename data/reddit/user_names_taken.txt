"nursing a glass of red wine"
I think this was over a long time ago.
It wasn't the that you lied about the equity.
You should have just told her you were gay.

Oh look a bcash website... bro I won't even give you a click through

Same here. It's sad that people downvote this here on this subreddit. 3 hours 0 confirmations. 
The first thing I do when I have a problem and need to know what is going on is to come to this subreddit to see what's going on. 
As usual I had to hunt for an answer at the bottom of the pile. I hope it confirms for you.
Big thanks to the users that let us know about what's going on with the wait times.

Dude it's been two plus hours here for me for 4 confirmations.  I don't get why you're being downvoted either. This is something that is currently happening and the state of Bitcoin.

That "hardly an issue" is a big deal, it's why an alt coin was just created.  It's why people hold large amounts of XRP and Litecoin. It's probably part of the reason BTC has lost a huge amount of it's market dominance.
Fast, secure, anonymous, and accountable
For somebody who does nothing with their Bitcoin except HODL, it is not a problem.
For anyone supporting the Bitcoin economy by using it, don't you think they deserve a better Bitcoin?

I feel like I'm streaming the lastest episode of my favourite show, with the vid player on pause, waiting for the whole thing to buffer before watching it.

Looking forward to it!

I'm on Newegg.ca trying to buy a PC. There is no Bitcoin option just credit card or paypal
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:50:40
The desktop version of newegg.ca definitely takes Bitcoin. Thank you for your help. I'm excited to get a new computer.
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:42:13
I am on mobile. Maybe thats the problem
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:35:52
I'm on it trying to purchase. There's no Bitcoin option. 
Just PayPal and credit card.
Thanks for the assistance though.

Isn't this how the coinbase website always looks? I thought it was just a place holder until they figure out how to internet.
