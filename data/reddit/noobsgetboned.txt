If miners weren't making money right now, they wouldn't mine.

I remember when Bitcoin was actually useful as a currency.

I didn't mention BCH. I mentioned bitcoin's lacking use as a currency. You see all the stupid "hodl" posts. What you don't see are posts actually encouraging people to use the currency. That's because Bitcoin isn't a very useful currency right now.

Why use Bitcoin at all? A coin could start up tomorrow that has all the currency features people dream Bitcoin might one day have. Why is Bitcoin better than that coin? Because some people already have money invested in it? What do market caps matter when only a tiny amount is actually exchanging Bitcoin for goods and services? 
Bitcoin could very well be the Myspace of the crypto world. The dollar stays around because people have to pay their taxes in it and it has a superpower backing it. What's to keep Bitcoin around when I can't even buy a Snickers bar for near MSRP?

High transaction fees are in the interest of miners, no?

I think you mean to say it will some day have the features you'd want. Because if it had them it wouldn't be developing.
It seems as if the miners don't want Bitcoin to be used as a currency because they won't make as much money as if it's an investment.

But high tx fees benefit all. Larger transactions from investors instead of sandwich buyers seem preferable to them. Edit:*All miners

They make Bitcoin off of transaction fees. So if they see Bitcoin having a higher value as an investment than a currency, they will do what they can to keep it that way.

How many years should we wait? How many have we waited? Why use Bitcoin instead of a coin that already has the currency features it should have?
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:06:43
No, the point of a currency is to be exchanged for goods and services. If Bitcoin isn't easy to spend, it will lose to something that is.

In 2013 I was shopping online with Bitcoin...

Hey man, whatever you have to tell yourself to get to sleep at night. I'm sure you'll have just as much fun doing things in your 40s they did in their 20s.

God forbid they spend their money living their lives now instead of when they're 65.

Massdrop accepts Bitcoin?

I'm doing quite a bit of investing, not in Bitcoin, though. I made purchases with bitcoin in 2013 with ease. Thought "wow, this is cool, I hope it takes off" It didn't. Why? Because Bitcoin is being considered an investment and not a currency. It hasn't been moving in the right direction since then, and I'm tired of hearing about X change to it that is only a year away that will help it make the jump. Then it doesn't.
