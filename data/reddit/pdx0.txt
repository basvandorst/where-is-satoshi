Ahh I skimmed through the paper. If I understood it correctly, Democoin claims to solve the scalability problem by removing the need to download the entire ledger by replacing decentralizing wasteful mining with this decentralized easy-breezy "verifying" process. 
One thing I didn't see was where proposal talks about new coin generation? I didn't quite catch that part, that's pretty important no?


Bitcoin  relies  on  a  very  complex  and  space-  and  time-inefficient mechanism  to  ensure  that  the  status  of  the  system  cannot  be  subverted.   Moreover,  more
and more it is being pointed out that a very large honest majority is required for the system to work properly.
By  contrast,  Democoin  relies  on  a  very  simple  and  very  efficient  mechanism  to  ensure  that a player with obsolete knowledge about the status of the system can accurately and securely reconstruct the true current status of the system.  Moreover,  Democoin only requires that a reasonable majority of the users is honest.

I appreciate your thoughts and I think I see where our views diverge. The value proposition of music.


I play music and I can tell you first hand that the boundless life enhancing joy it brings me is immeasurably valuable. And I've never played for more then a handful of close friends. Money and the things it bought has it's purpose but never once brought me that level of creative fulfillment. I propose sheer materialism never will if you're honest with yourself, only information transfer. When art becomes a product it is no longer called art, it is called advertising. Good art asks a question, while advertising gives you the answer.
This is model I support: I see art which enhances my life --&gt; I and other fans support the artist in a voluntary manner --&gt; they continue to produce art which enhances my life and the cycle continues
I don't claim to deserve to benefit from their art but I will show my appreciation when I do because it will allow them to create more of it if they so choose. And as agentgreen420 has so keenly stated above, the cat's out of the bag on this one.

I think you're mistaking comical irony for arrogance. In my opinion millionaires make 'garbage' music and any band that does it for the love of money should really just sell their amps and instead become bankers, it's a more efficient and reliable source of income.
I work because I enjoy my job and I help make the world a better place doing it. The money I make is just a means to help me increase the well being of conscious creatures on this planet. Money and it's sole pursuit is never more than a fleeting source of satisfaction. True and lasting happiness is in fact attainable once your basic needs are taken care of but this is something you have to discover on your own journey through life.
Music, much like software is information. Software should be open source and freely distributed just as music should be freely distributed. If you don't agree then this is strange sub for you spend your time in. 
Ask yourself this, do you believe that Satoshi gave us the bitcoin software for fame &amp; money or did he spend all that time to make the world a fairer and more peaceful place? I'm going with the latter.

Except of course in China... where some might argue the communist revolution dramatically improved the lives of hundreds of millions of people in terms of wealth, opportunity, education.. etc, not to mention [recently over took the USA as the world largest economy.]( I assume you've been trained to think of China as an evil totalitarian regime which routinely terrorizes it's populace, just like the media has trained you to feel negatively towards Communism, but the truth is the world isn't all that black and white.
Good guys, bad guys and perfect systems of government are idealistic myths, the reality is much more dynamic. I propose that any system of government will lead to an Authoritarian one that does all those vile things you mentioned and always must be revolted against after a time.

Actually ziepheiw's calculations argued that the variance between a 50% and 20% pool is not huge with increasing difficulty but went on to indeed admit that joining smaller pools (15% and below) does significantly increase variance risk.
As I'm typing this, the top 5 pool options I see are 39%, 14%, 9%, 6%, 4%. 
So ziepheiw is actually agreeing what everyone who actually does mining already intuitively knows.. It's just too risky to drop 50k $'s on a mining rig that will be obsolete in 6 months and hope you're not unlucky. Once you're obsolete, you're obsolete. Mining rig lifetimes are finite and this effect leads to risk averse behaviour.

Hello Hadek!
Coinbase gives you a web based wallet and you can keep your coins there if you like, however, I always feel more secure keeping my coins in a wallet I control on one of my own computers. You can think of it as keeping your gold bars in a storage locker at the airport versus in a safe in your own home.
If you feel confident that you can manage your home computer securely and free of viruses, I recommend you download a wallet program called Electrum or Multibit and transfer your coins from Coinbase wallet to one of those wallets on your computer. Next I would encrypt the wallet file (basically set a password to spend the coins).
And that's just for starters, there's lots to learn. :)

We as in anyone who values truly a decentralized currency system, which hope most people here do. Make no mistake, blacklist is a huge first step on the journey to rendering bitcoin as manipulated as any government issued fiat.
"monstrous server side code" is pure hyperbole, generating a new address is trivial. And as a matter of fact all online merchants **already** use unique address for getting payments as this makes for effective order differentiation.
Non-commercial "Buy Me a Beer" user static donation type addresses you're talking about would have to receive on average more than 6 transactions an hour to even notice a difference and actually these types of transactions do not need to be spent by the recipient immediately anyways. But I still contend that their use should be discouraged for the greater good of the payment system.

Industrial and aesthetic uses of Gold do not justify it's value, the vast majority of gold's value is derived only from human perception.
There are a shit ton of cheaper, rust-proof, shiny metals and plastics that can be effectively substituted for Gold in jewelery at a fraction of the cost. Therefore, jewelery is not the reason for Gold's value, Gold is the reason gold jewelery is valuable (not the other way around) and human perception is the reason gold is valuable... just like Bitcoin.
Now gold has properties that make it a good *money*, i.e. fungibility, divisibility, scarcity, etc. however bitcoin shares those properties (and a few more) which make it good for being used as *money* also.
Gold i has been around for thousands of years. Bitcoin has been around for 4 years -- this is a valid criticism.

Don't simply talk about Bitcoin, **SHOW** them!  Do this exactly:
* Use your cell to video call someone in CYPRUS (maybe have them stand beside a famous land mark, show host)
* Ask host to pick a number from 1 to 10. Let's say they say "7".
* Have Cypriot person to send you 7 thousand Euro's in BTC.
* Show host account new BTC wallet balance.
If the host is not a complete tool, some light bulbs should be going off at this point. Capital controls... bitcoin users not affected.
