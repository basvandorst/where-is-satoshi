i'm waiting for when to buy more. bought just before this dip, want to buy at the bottom of the dip. did i already miss it? some think it'll go back to 8000 by tomorrow. it's 1am where i am and i need to sleep. think i should buy now or wait 6 hours and buy/decide then?
think it could keep going, or it could be bouncing back now...
think i'll stay up another hour.

computers have replaced telephones, tvs, cameras, watches, traditional graphic design tools, cell animation
and now they're replacing ovens.

what happened to his faaaaaaace?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:46:55
that's what happened after the last "bubble" burst. people bought up more because the price was low.
bitcoin has greater use as currency imo, because it's always increasing in value in the long run, and the processing fees are low for large amounts. can't beat it. i heard sometimes transaction fees are high for small purchases though, which is a problem.

don't be so salty. you know damn well there's a bunch of people here with "it's over 9000" memes just waiting for that to happen.

it won't at some point. but once it's mined out it'll maintain its value.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:14:35
too bad i'll never use ethereum because they hate white people.

I got into crypto because it was an alternative to fiat currency. Not as an investment vehicle.

as a south african, let me just say, it's cute that they think people are going to cash out their bitcoin for rand. especially as the economy goes full zimbabwe 
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:47:21
does this mean they're going to try and tax it now?

what would you say are the best options available?

i'm not making a regular paycheck now, but when i do i'll be doing the same thing. i'm thinking about buying a bunch with my savings right now though, and would hate to do that before a drop in price.

to short it before you buy more bitcoin, or to invest in other coins.
crypto is the future. one way or another. but we can't really predict exactly what that is going to mean with regard to specific holdings.

a big part of this, as far as i understand, are the upcoming landgrabs in south africa. will probably be a bigger economic disaster than zimbabwe.

i wonder how much it'll be worth once it's mined out. i realize that has to do with external markets as well, but has anyone done any kind of estimate?
my bro runs a [mining company that lets you invest in mines]( the returns aren't as high, but neither are the risks. i'd recommend anyone with cold feet start with something like that.
but i think what a lot of people miss with bitcoin is its potential as a global decentralized currency. everyone just wants to speculate right now for the most part. but when you look at transaction costs for moving large sums of money around, that's when people with long-term views should really drool.

trump can't even secure the border. and that's what he ran on. your pot is going to be fine.
if the republican party was smart, they'd trade legalization for border enforcement, immigration reform and gun rights.

i have some ideas but i like this subreddit and i don't want to get banned for antisemitism. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:34:28
so sell at $10K and buy after the crash?
good advice.
would you buy more now, will this news drive the price up more? always want the most bitcoin for my bullshit paper money, as does everyone.

i got into this to displace the banks that destroy the world. not moon lambo lmfao. i'd have my portfolio nosedive to under $100 a bitcoin if it somehow meant crypto would overtake fiat currency.
