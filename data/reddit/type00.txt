I think MEGA is working on that; Client side encryption, payed with bitcoins of course.

Anti-virus only detect like 20% of the actual working virus, so it may be your computer anyway.
Do what Jiten says, paste a text version of the transaction history.

I see your common sense is damaged. As you can see "anyone" does not include the OP, as he beleives he is safe just by scanning, my comment is just a warning.
Expect no further answers from me. Enjoy your down votes.

I saw this a while ago: 
I think it's a more or less good tutorial for understanding how to mine testnet bitcoins and what they are. If anyone interested.

No no, the price of bitcoin drives the difficulty up or down, difficulty does nothing to the price.
You see, if the price makes mining profitable, you grab your GPUs and mine. If you get your GPU and mine, well, you get some bitcoins if you are lucky, but you sell them at the market price.

I created an account just to say; Yes i want poker with bitcoins, with a responsible non-anonymous staff.
I would add; take so much care with the site security.

Will they ship? yes.
Will they ship to you in less than 4/5 months? i don't think so.

Okay, so let's say i'm interested, but i'm a normal person who doesn't know shit about placing a ATM. Are they going to instruct me on how to do it? how to protect it? how to handle it safe? I mean, who is the people interested? I just buy it, fill it with coins and wait for people to buy? or is it linked to a MtGox pre-founded account which does the transaction at the time of the purchase? 
lol so many questions.

While it's true that FE is a company that sells something, the information described in the link i gave is well known by the security researchers, i just gave zeledga a link so he can see it from other source than "my made-up bullshit".
FE doesn't sell AVs, which is why Av-Comparatives doesn't mention them.
Yes you can have a AV for some minimal protection, but once again, it's minimal protection. OP said "I scanned my computer for viruses. Nothing" kinda discarding a intrusion on his system, which is a bad idea, the intruder can still be there waiting for new bitcoins to steal.
There are lots of wallet security tutorials, i suggest the OP to read those.

Oh damn, i read wrong, deleting.

Maybe because the paying customers with a 6 month delay will have much more competition with that kind of advertising? BFL does nothing but advertise and doesn't care about the customers they already have, they should be fully concentrated in delivering to already paying customers instead of looking for more customers.

Despite your shitty attitude, i will answer you.
FireEye is one of the most important security companies, read the Anti-virus section in that page. You can investigate the ineffectiveness of the anti-virus just by googling this:

You can do that with Coinbase don't you? After verification of course.

Please upvote this comment. Reading exactly what the chinese are believing would be great! And i would tip the guy who subtitles it if i had bitcoins right now.
@_date: 2013-05-04 20:46:01
A question, does the documentary mention ASIC or FPGA? Does the documentary leaves the chinese with the idea of "To mine bitcoin you just sit back and relax while your miners give you money"?
If the documentary explains mining as a extremely simple task, many people will be on board in no time.

Thanks! how about the "easiness" of bitcoin mining, do they mention how hard or easy is to set up a miner? 
Your english level is good.

That's where IT Forensics come into the game, unless you are talking about a inside job that the site wants to cover.

Well, you can unplug your printer from power for some minutes, all stored documents should be gone by then. Maybe packets being captured wirelessly is the most factible scenario ( i haven't tried to capture packets sent to printers tho. I will avoid wireless if i ever print a paper wallet.
