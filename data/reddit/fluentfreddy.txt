You kind of need to explain this more than "lots of things WoC is doing differently".  From where we stand it looks like Localbitcoins for the US only.  Not trying to be rude or difficult, but if you explain the differences you will be doing a lot more for promoting your site than just saying it's different.

Ooookay - so how does the gel with: "Send &amp; Receive Globally
Bitcoin is digital money without borders. You pay no fee to send and receive bitcoin on igot." and "Global transfers made easy
Send Bitcoin to family, friends, or colleagues. It’s free!
Why should I send Bitcoin?
If you’re looking for a
CHEAPER, FASTER AND SAFER WAY TO SEND MONEY TO SOMEONE,
it’s hard to beat if you use the Bitcoin network."

Just asking cos I bought coin on your site and lost about 20% before I was able to send it onwards - took like over a week for the xfer!

So a fraudulent sticker on the machine... Now who wants to entrust their bitcoin to a bunch of Chinese hackers????

And it's this sort of fickle comment that makes people wonder if they should bother with a product in the bitcoin space
