I'm not sure if I understand you correctly.
If you have a phone and an air-gapped device, but you need to connect them to merge the data, then the device is not air-gapped anymore, which will put your key at risk. Your solution would definitely be better than a regular wallet, but as soon as you connect an air-gapped device to one that has an internet connection, there is a risk of losing your key.
It sounds like our solution is exactly what you are proposing, only with QR-scanning instead of "connecting" the devices. QR-scanning is a great way to enable one-way communication. If you connect your devices via USB, Bluetooth or WiFi, you never know what is being sent back and forth. With QR codes you know exactly what is happening. That's why we think it's a perfect fit for a wallet app like AirGap.

You can use our system in 2 different ways.
The **most secure** way is to use it on 2 separate phones. Which of course only makes sense if you store a large amount of crypto and is not suited for daily transactions. (Communication via QR codes)
The other way is to install both apps on the same phone. This approach is less secure because the Vault app (which holds your private keys) is on a device that is connected to the internet. We made it as secure as possible by disabling all networking capabilities. In this approach, the apps communicate via app-switching.
Having a separate hardware device additionally sounds like an interesting idea, we'll think about it!

It is! You should give it a try. Especially the single device setup is almost as fast as a regular transaction, but due to the 2 app setup, it's a lot more secure.
Just remember, when handling a large sum of money, you should always go for the 2 device approach.
