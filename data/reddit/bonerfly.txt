I think a lot of coinbase users also would just sign unto their account in the payment widget. The QR codes are kind of default for beginners though, you're right.

They are presumably owned by their shareholders, which doesn't make them a private company. That being said, this is great example that just because Havelock offers 'shares' and 'IPOs', doesn't mean that the companies are actually public... They are just pretending to be.

If you get an Antminer S1 from bitmaintech.com, you *might* get your money back before it becomes obsolete.
As most have / will tell you, it's easier to just buy a bitcoin. I have free power, and was interested in how mining worked, so I bought one anyway. Been running for 2 weeks, and have paid back 27% of my initial investment. Difficulty is always going up though (like in 2 or so hours today), so it is diminishing returns.

Just sent him a note, thanks for the find!
"Hi Chuck,
As an owner of an e-commerce business in NYC, I wanted to voice my concern with Senator Manchin's recent comments about banning bitcoins.
My company plans to follow the path led by American innovators Reddit and Overstock.com, and integrate bitcoin as a payment option on our site this year.
To Senator Manchin's concern that the US will be left 'holding the bag' IF all other countries ban bitcoin, I would argue the opposite. If the US attempts to ban bitcoin, the spenders of this global currency will go elsewhere with their money leaving American companies like mine high and dry.
I plan on writing the Senator as well with this view, but thought you might be more receptive to this message.
Thank you for your time."

Your 'point' about the market being manipulated is irrelevant. Of course it is manipulated. And you think that *if* we could actually create a craft capable of landing on an asteroid (keep in mind this is still an extremely difficult feat in the space exploration world), and *if* said craft could successfully mine thousands of tonnes of gold and *if* it then could successfully bring this payload back to earth without refueling, only to bring gold's price down to a dollar an ounce, that the same forces manipulating the gold market would fund such a project? Put another way, if we found an asteroid covered in diamonds, do you think for a second debeers would let their multi billion dollar business just die? Haha no way in hell.

This is quite a round about way, but it seems like that is what you are asking for. You can sell silver or gold at and ask for bitcoin payment. A lot of the silver bugs are now transacting in BTC because of no charge backs and low fees.

Can confirm. I made my first purchase through circle on Friday, and noticed my bank charged me a $10 cash advance fee for buying $20 of bitcoin... Not a good rate. Going to try my other CC this week to see if it was card specific.

Hmmm, OK, well I don't want to get into an argument over it, but I'd be genuinely curious which calculator and assumptions you used? I used bitcoinwisdom with an increment of 22%, free power, and a unit cost of 450. I'm on eligius and paying a pool fee of 1% as donation... And I've overclocked to 200GH/s.

Was trying to implement coinbase on my e commerce site this week and ran into this problem. Submitted a ticket to robin  and basically got a "well I don't know" response after much back and forth. perhaps it might be worth reviewing escalating issues internally? I flagged this almost 3 days ago, as others may have done. I imagine 3 days of failed payments on overstock and Expedia is not negligible.
@_date: 2014-06-26 00:18:26
There's still something kinda magic about it though...
@_date: 2014-06-26 20:28:28
In our case, the most common chargeback is marking the item as 'not delivered', or 'general' (not even sure what general means tbh). We have proof via UPS that the item was delivered, in some cases over several months, and we still lose when submitting documentation through Stripe. We're not losing the roof over our heads, but it is enough to be frustrating. 
To be fair to Stripe, they have an amazing API and customer support staff, and we really value their service. Can't wait to see their bitcoin plans pan out, though I haven't heard much since their announcement.
@_date: 2014-03-24 14:31:10
Ditto. I'm a developer and keep working with new technologies all the time, but when deciding how to start playing with something I don't yet understand, I will always choose the option with the most reputable backing. I opened a Box account but never used it, bought my first bitcoin on coinbase, and have since created wallets on blockchain and opened a kraken account.
Edit: grammar.
@_date: 2014-06-26 20:37:34
That's the chargeback fee. The normal fee is in line with Paypal, and the API is much more fun to implement.

Trying to catch a bottom is nearly impossible. You need to look at your own financial situation, your own belief in bitcoin's potential based on your own research, and decide if you are comfortable taking the risk. It is one of the riskier investments out there, but many of us on this sub have decided that in some capacity we believe in it enough to warrant an investment.

This was a new concept for me this week reading through this subreddit, and I think it balances the solutions nicely. CC's lean towards consumer protection, bitcoin towards seller - let the seller incent as they may, and the cusotmer decide for themselves.
@_date: 2014-05-12 15:02:53
I think point 4 is often forgotten by those who argue that bitcoin is not viable for payments. As a merchant I can confirm I lose several hundreds a month to charge backs. Even when taking the time to submit evidence that our product was delivered as promised, we rarely have the dispute go in our favor.

Ha! I'd be worried about the customers we'd get by calling it Boytry. Seriously though, we know it's not the cheapest subscription box out there, but all the products that come are full sized (no snack portions), they're handmade in the USA by artisan makers we pay full wholesale, and even the crate is made in the USA. We could outsource some of this stuff and make it $10 cheaper, but we think the Made in America thing is pretty important.

Mostly because convincing the world population that it was safe to point an asteroid at earth to bring it into orbit would be a tall order.

This is a good point. I am a realist, I don't expect bitcoin to replace 100% of my credit card customers by introducing a discount (I'd even be happy for now if bitcoin made up 1% of our business). I am a huge believer in the technology though, and I'd like to do whatever I can to encourage growth of the network. For this reason, we are planning to convert minimal amount of bitcoin to fiat.

Could be a great promotional item to hand out small amounts of bitcoin to people. I'd talk to someone at Coinbase or BitPay or circle and see if they have interest in this. You could load each one up with a wallet with some bits and a video explaining how to use them and they'd be a great promo item.
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:38:43
The time delay is the biggest thing for me (note: I use coinbase to buy all my coin). A full week to convert fiat to coin severely hamstrings one of the main benefits of bitcoin: near instant transfers.

Are you French? Concurrence = competition :)

Right, this obviously does not have the transparency of bitcoin, but I was surprised by the lack of fees as well. Seems like the learning curve is a little lower, encouraging adoption for extremely non technical types...
@_date: 2014-06-27 02:34:48
Haha that made me laugh

Shit! You're right. Added it to the post. Thanks for pointing that out.

I assure you I am not making this up. This is all I get from our credit card processor - I can email the customer to try to get them to reverse the charge, and submit my evidence, but there is no one I get to 'talk' to, and we've never had one of these claims ruled in our favor despite providing plenty of evidence.

+1 coffee

I peruse regularly. I've learned some good tips on there for saving budgeting, etc.
Refilled my changetip today, and thought I'd spread some of the love for a comment I found particularly insightful.
Got down voted for giving a cup of coffee. Well at least the guy I tipped appreciated it. Haters gonna hate?

Hey thanks!!

Our guy is Bentons main competition. We'll put in Benton one day, we love their product.

Well it changes every month, but is always 6 full size food products from the USA. the photo on the link posted in the OP is what your first month will be. You can see past crates in the 'past bixes' section.

My company does. Right now the sales we do in bitcoin are just a small percent of the total, so we've decided to just hang on to the coins and see what happens. We've also used them to pay for some small overseas contracts that would have been harder to facilitate without bitcoin.

I've set up two alerts on coin patrol - one if the price drops past my previously set buy price, one if it rises past where I'd like to sell some coin. It texts me if either happens, anything in between I don't really care about.

If a reduction in merchant fees allowed merchants to get rid of the "$10 minimum", I'd pay attention!

I keep waiting for honest ed's to open. When's it gonna open??
@_date: 2014-06-27 12:38:49
I only know cause the reverse always got me when learning French. I would always say 'competition' with a French accent ha!
Oh and 'especiellement' was another good made up Franglais word.

I like business insider, but has anyone noticed they have a serious hard on for bitcoin? I don't think its a bad thing (obv.), but curious who on the team has a big stake in bitcoin's success...
@_date: 2014-07-11 16:44:43
I mined with Antminer S1's for about 2.5 months and ROI'd with free power. It is certainly possible to profit a bit, but keep in mind that you are not only speculating on bitcoin price, but also difficulty increases. With buying and holding coins, you're only speculating on price.
Edit: I should also mention it was fun to do for a while, and my understanding of the technology deepened because of it. I think you could achieve similar learning with a cheap $20 USB miner though.

One hell of a read. This explained bitcoin and the blockchain better than anything I've read so far!
@_date: 2014-06-20 20:48:29
Wasn't expecting the third option. I'm a shareholder of PETA and currently mine on Eligius. Is it generally agreed that the best option for decentralization is PETA switching to P2P over BTCGuild or Eligius? I like Eligius, but understand that it is fundamentally no safer than GHash if many people joined...
@_date: 2014-06-26 20:34:06
Thanks! We're two co-founders with a pretty big team of part time contractors filling in the gaps.

TBH, we're not really targeting the health demo. All the products we feature are small batch and made in the USA, so they tend to be very high quality (no fillers, GMO and lots of organic), but we send a lot of 'treats' too that might not be good for all diets!
@_date: 2014-09-12 17:45:14
Just got mine too. Based in New York, so there goes the theory that they weren't sending to New Yorkers.
Man that interface is nice!

As a canuck who just paid $350 to go see the doctor and have a mole removed in the US, I wouldn't be so quick to bash Canada. Having 4 cavaliers ain't all its cracked up to be.

I think you mean Y axis, and that's what log graphs do... take exponential growth and make it look linear.
@_date: 2016-09-18 14:31:31
Yeah I might suggest adding a UX designer to the career section, or at very least hire a freelancer with a strong visual design background.
Not trying to be mean or anything, I'm really vying for you guys and what you to be able to put your best foot forward!
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:28:33
I would watch 12 hours of this.
@_date: 2016-05-03 16:11:15
Would you be willing to share what happened?
