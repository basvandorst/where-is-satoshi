Well yes, that does take a lot of time, too.  I was more under the impression that it was inventory issues than actually waiting for the design to be finished.
EDIT: Spelling.

I haven't looked much into Avalon, but the basic design you're talking about intrigues me.  I was thinking that the design would have to be aesthetically pleasing to sell well.  Would you care much about how it looks, so long as it is a low power/high throughput design?

That's one of the things that I've seen as well as I've started looking into competitors.  I'm currently looking at PCB (printed circuit board) designers that can create a board from start to finish in the matter of 24 hours to alleviate this problem.
Thanks for your input.

Thank you!  I can imagine that being quite annoying.
One of the issues with cooling is the fact that air can't flow over the chip well if it's enclosed in a box.  Would you purchase a board that looks something like [this](

Ease of use is one of the things that I've noticed is lacking not only in hardware miners, but also in mining software.  Not everyone likes the command prompt, and I doubt many users want to deal with (or care about) any source code coming with it.  Windows users just want a binary that they can run, looks pretty, and above all, works.
Assuming that this gets off the ground and is profitable, I'll be providing a GPU miner free of charge with a nice GUI.  Any interfacing that occurs between my hardware and a laptop will also have a GUI.

So how does someone who is purchasing a miner figure out whether or not they will make enough money to beat the cost of electricity?  Do they just trust the manufacturer to say that their device will be profitable?

The only concern that I have with these boards is if someone spills something on them.  But I'd love it if I could use that set of boards made by Terasic.  I own a larger, [more powerful board]( which I used as an undergraduate to build my own CPUs on.

Wow!!  This is quite a long response.  Thanks!  I really appreciate the time that you put into this.
Thank you for confirming a lot of my thoughts.  I left a lot of things out of my post mainly because I wanted to hear what other's had to say, and not what I thought was important.  Power consumption has been a big thing in the computer architecture industry for a while, and that isn't going to change unless we find some magical new material and design process for chips.  
I feel that there are improvements which can be made in terms of both hashing power per mm^2 and power consumption, which is why I still feel that the market can be entered successfully.
Thanks again for your time and your thoughts.  I'll be posting back on this subreddit when the time comes from me to start marketing my product, assuming that it can be done so profitably.

Thanks for the reply!  I'll have to go look at those calculators.
Power consumption will be a priority for my products :).
