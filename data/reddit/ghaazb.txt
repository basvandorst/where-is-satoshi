You're the worst kind of human being possible. Also, you're a complete idiot. Understand things more.

If you have "household debt" you're a member of the global elite. 
Most people would kill for some household debt. 
"Ugh", and we wonder why hipsters try to talk about economics.

Nope.

Accepting Bitcoin would allow me to begin gambling right now (or about 10 minutes from now, or however it takes to DL the client). This changes the fact that I can't gamble right now. 
I'm confused about how you're possibly confused.

You have ran through 250k and drive a range rover, and don't recognize how ridiculously lucky and shitty of a human you are? I'm sorry that you exist, it's not my fault.
No go cry about your debt some more while you drive the bank's range rover and pumps tons of carbondioxide into the lungs of poor people.

I watched the changetip video with the girl with the all-too-alluring whisper in her voice, it was great. Is this all I do to tip:

This is confusing to me. How can a a coin be used more than once in the same block? Doesn't that constitute double spending?

There is the rumoured MasterCard Vanilla or something that I've HEARD works for Stars, but in 2 years I've never been able to find one (and I've literally pulled my hair out looking). I've lost a couple hundred bucks buying different prepaids and finding that they don't work (of course, I didn't *lose* the money). I would love to know how I could do a direct bank deposit (without online banking?).
Anyway, these restrictions are made entirely to keep poor people from being victimized by online gambling. I'm sorry that you didn't know or understand that, but now you do.
I welcome Bitcoin on Stars too, but there isn't anything conceivable that could ever make that happen.

This is Reddit. It's the only place you're allowed to make comments without citations.
If you'd like evidence, live in Canada and then try to gamble online without a credit card.

Never lived in either city, but I know those are both locations of widespread Chinese diaspora in the Southern Ontario region. 
I've actually travelled all over Canada, living in Toronto most of my life but being to both coasts and in between. I promise, all of Canada is full of Chinese, not just Markham/Scarborough. 
Of course, if it weren't full of Chinese, we would have no economy, and we'd probably just belong to America by now.

Lol..... hilarious that I would stumble upon this, as I'm the user who you tipped $20 to. It certainly got me more interested, and it allowed me to participate in micro-trading, which has really lead to my full adoption of the technology, as well as a ton of excitement. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:23:21
Yeah, they are advertised everywhere, never in stock. 
And I don't have a checkings account, I'm poor remember? lol. 
If you're shocked it hasn't happened, you're just not thinking hard enough. When I first read the white paper (late 2013), I instantly said: "WOW, I'm going to create my own micro-trading site". That was already done 1000 times of course, so next I thought altcoin. Already done. As I went down the list, one of the next things I thought of was a gambling site.
My point is, absolutely everyone realizes how Bitcoin could make gambling 1000000000 times easier. It's one of the firstt ideas even a kid like me with no education thinks of. It's *not going to happen*. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:00:46
Haha yep. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 16:28:36
Decent... but this isn't the bigger picture lol. 
Bitcoin is new piping for the financial world, that's it. It made early adapters rich because it's like they invented a new, better money press, then pressed themselves some money. 
It's a better system of transferring money, but it doesn't really fundamentally change anything. The currency itself is completely worthless, and could be substituted by anything really. It's the piping, the blockchain, that is revolutionary. And it's not revolutionary in a way that any of you seem to even remotely understand.

Stupid old white people are fucking stupid. Hurry up and die so the world can begin to move again uggggh. (Sorry to everyone, but your parents, and especially grandparents, gotta fuckin' go...... now).

Go with this option if available. Much safer for such a high volume.

I've never personally met a Chinese person who wasn't catholic (and I live in Canada where most people are Chinese). Of course, I don't ask them all about their religion. I think it's fair to assume that Christmas is pretty big there though. Def bigger than here, at least (by sheer volume).

Primate societies are characterized by class distinctions that are generalized into basic categories, the top and the bottom. In human society, a middle class tends to form due to our implementation of social institutions and economic cooperation. 
On the global scale, any person who has access to credit is in a far better position than (more than half of) the rest of the world, who don't have access to credit, or even financial institutions. This put you in the top 50% already. So, if you were to have, say, 250k debt, you would need to shut the fuck up and stop complaining because spending that 250k probably got you a house and a car and food. Having these items (house and car, at least) put you very very high indeed on the global scale. 
Actually OWNING your own house and car puts you in almost THE most minuscule percentage of humans. If this is your life, you're completely ignorant to what almost every other human being means by "the human experience". You are, but almost any definition, a member of the global elite. 
So stop complaining, literally about anything, and just watch TV until you're dead.

And that's all there is to it?

Wicked man. I'll be paying most of this forward. You're a good guy!
I'm off to find some tip-worthy sutff.

Seems to me like Bitcoin makes Salami Slicing infinitely easier. Gotta pay attention to them transactions lol.

1000 bits @_date: 2014-12-06 10:19:49
Apologies. I didn't mean to break any rules (other than the Canadian regulation of Bitcoin). For what it's worth, this post generated some real love that I will be paying forward, spreading the Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:18:13
Ah yes, that actually makes sense. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-12-19 16:46:45
Meh, I don't know why people are always so concerned about the fees. Wake up and realize that fees simply aren't the things that anybody gives a shit about.
When you tell someone they can make transactions all day with no fees, they actually just become more sceptical (often). 
The reason that Stars should accept Bitcoin (but never will, even in a different universe where Bitcoin is the only currency)  is to circumvent gambling restrictions which exist all over the world. 
Here in Canada, only rich people are allowed to gamble. You may not make a deposit with Paypal, your bank account, or even a prepaid credit card. You MUST have a credit card to gamble. 
So, unless Stars wants to be completely banned from most places in the world, they're not going to start accepting Bitcoin probably ever. The idea that they would is ill-conceived wishful thinking with no basis in reality. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:57:28
Man, holy crap. You're the man.
I will send you the $20 on paypal right now if you want, just inbox me your email. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 11:28:55
Hmm, that's really bad eh. 
Here in Canada, I'm pretty sure it's just enforce some of the gambling restrictions, but they also just don't know what to do with Bitcoin yet. 
We'll see how it pans out. I'd really appreciate if my government didn't force me to break rules in threads or go to shady vendors to get Bitcoin. I want to buy from the trusted sites with Paypal. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 08:31:42
Fair enough. I feel a little dumb now I suppose.
