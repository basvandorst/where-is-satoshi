will I have to meet in person there?
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:55:27
registration required.
@_date: 2017-03-12 05:40:24


does bitcoin core do that automatically -- throws away unnecessary, old data, in the prune mode?
@_date: 2017-03-16 02:56:02
I'm not asking about that shit
@_date: 2017-03-06 09:47:43
@_date: 2017-03-12 06:14:38
alright. I have bitcoin-cli, bitcoin-qt, bitcoind. which one should I run with "prune=&lt;N&gt;"?
also I have electrum.
@_date: 2017-03-11 11:56:22
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:41:47
i said bitcoin core
@_date: 2017-03-11 11:06:49
how can I specify the path where it should store the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:51:42
and a computer.
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:17:26
my question isn't what I can and cannot.
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:04:28
maybe I should I run it in the prune mode instead?

@_date: 2017-03-13 05:40:31
1) so there's no support yet and that's a workaround? 2) what makes a wallet watch-only in your example?
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:14:04
and electricity
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:06:28


I need a infinite number of them, as many as whatever amount of customers I'll have -- each customer for each transaction will have a new address. How can I handle that?
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:15:47
why not?
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:04:14
how can I add an address via cli?
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:19:29
yeah, but I'll need to generate an address first. How?
@_date: 2017-03-12 08:44:07
1) on a server, however, I have to use bitcoind only, right?
2) on a desktop, how to get bitcoind or bitcoin-qt to share the same folder for downloaded blockchain? 
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:08:36
that's not my focus at this stage. watch-only address will do.
My question isn't about "what", it's about "how"  exactly.
@_date: 2017-03-12 06:08:28
the full node size now is over 100 Gb, how much will it take in the prune mode approximately?
@_date: 2017-03-11 10:26:47
so how can I download it?
@_date: 2017-04-01 10:28:47
ok, thanks.


can you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:30:41
yes, during the night. if a customer comes to my website at 2 am, I'll have to reload a page in browser every minute to make sure a payment has come through. and do so for each customer 24/7.
@_date: 2017-04-16 05:15:58
they're not set
@_date: 2017-04-04 18:03:53
porn, or not porn - whatever. there're different timezones, you haven't been aware of that?
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:07:15


 
do you mean compared to walletnotify? why?


can you elaborate?
I have to wait for 6 confirmations for each transaction/receiving_address, right? Do I have to merely keep calling "listtransactions" until there're 6 of them?
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:17:23
thanks. but. I'll have to call "listtransactions" every few seconds, then iterate over each transaction, extract a receiving address from each one and the compare it with one I'm waiting a payment from, and only if they match I'll have to check how much bitcoins have arrived and the number of confirmations.... that's a lot of work and not efficient, isn't it? 
@_date: 2017-04-04 05:42:50


can you give me the links?
@_date: 2017-04-03 10:37:42










Walletnotify will get triggered when:
1 First receiving a payment
2 First conformation on the payment
3 You send a payment
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:33:56
right, but a receive address is stored anyway.
@_date: 2017-04-04 16:41:00
if I used an 3rd party service, why would I care about listtransactions?
@_date: 2017-04-17 04:50:10


for example?
@_date: 2017-04-17 18:04:09
even dbcache=10, maxmempool=100 didn't work on 512 ram
@_date: 2017-04-04 16:42:14
I store a receive address. But how does it solve my issue? I still have to call listransactions every minute, iterate over each of one and they might be a lot of them, look for a receive address in each one and compare it with the one I'm waiting btx from, then check the balance and number of confirmations ..... that's plenty of work, isn't it? I mean, iterating over all transactions each time because tx_id can change
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:52:40
what is your question?
@_date: 2017-04-01 07:56:48


which one will I  need?
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:28:55
i don't understand
@_date: 2017-04-01 00:39:41

"moreover, they're deprecated in bitcoin rpc."
@_date: 2017-04-16 04:43:34
doesn't work.
I don't want to set them. for what? only to make a python library happy?
@_date: 2017-04-16 04:43:51
why? bitcoin works well without them. moreover, they're deprecated in bitcoin rpc.
@_date: 2017-04-17 04:49:43
how much ram is recommended?
