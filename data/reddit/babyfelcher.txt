Insanity Wolf approves.

Anyone tried getting Ting onboard?

Right. What I'm hoping for at this point is a baseband processor that talks to the rest of the phone through a network interface rather than through shared memory or whatever.
If that interface to the cell network has to be a black box, fine. But then it needs to be the bitch of the rest of the phone, and the rest of the phone needs to be fully open source **and** audited for security and integrity all the way down to bare metal. There needs to be an actual hard switch on the outside of the phone that I can use to turn off the baseband processor, too. Why? Because I fucking feel that way, yo.

It's because most people don't realize that it's a problem, and the ones that do feel like there's little that they can do about it. Making a smartphone is a very difficult thing to do. 
No, I have no recommendations, because there isn't really a viable option right now. Because even the most open platforms still rely on proprietary firmware, and all of them require the blackbox, potential privacy/security nightmare that is the baseband processor.
The companies and the governments own our mobile devices. They own everything we do on them. They own the data that you create through using your phone. They own your conversations, your text messages, and your email.They own the infrastructure. They own all of it.
And once Bitcoin becomes a real threat to them, they'll hire the best engineers and spend all kinds of money on building a vast mining operation that lets them own that too, unless Bitcoin people can think of a way to mitigate that before it happens. That needs to the focus of the conversation above anything else.
But anyway, this is about mobile phones. 
Smartphones aren't made for us. They're for them. If you want to give corporations and governments all kinds of telemetry on you and your personal life, then pretty much any mobile phone is equally good at that. Take your pick.

The Blockchain keeps track of it for eternity.
You have to go out of your way to have real anonymity with Bitcoin. It's dangerous to spread the myth that Bitcoin will automatically allow you to transact privately.

Everyone has to initially exchange phone numbers now. That process isn't foreign to anyone, and exchanging public key fingerprints isn't much of a stretch. This is only as unlikely as getting a new communication app to catch on.
Oh, PGP? Yeah, that won't be widely adopted in its current form. But wrap it up into something shiny, and people might use it.

Doesn't solve the problem of shady hardware and firmware.

It's more like you've leased it from Apple for a one-time payment. You can't reverse-engineer it. You aren't allowed to know how it works internally. Not that Shitdroid is all that much better.
We need a mobile platform that isn't a glittery piece of shit dropped by the ass of corporate America.

Your private key isn't derived from your passphrase. They would have to gain access to your machine first to decrypt your messages. This isn't a huge concern if you're only worried about mass surveillance.

Yeah, it's a start. But until we have a semi-trustworthy way of interfacing with the cell network, you can only trust the phone itself so far.

People are going to stick with polished applications that work well and that their friends use. Normal people don't even know what open source means. 
Free software is the broccoli that you sneak in under the macaroni and cheese. Figure out what the mac  n' cheese is in this context, then people won't know or care that they're using the green vegetable called PGP.

Yeah, running a datacenter on a thousand of Richard Stallman's magic laptops isn't going to cut it.
