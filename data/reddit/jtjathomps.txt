Institutional investors have hardly weighed in.  There aren't even good vehicles for them yet - only things like GBTC.   You're conflating some stories in the news with the 'public' phase, when in fact most of the public has no idea.  This happens when people in the know live in a bubble talking to others in the know all the time.    The market cap for gold is 7.8 TRILLION.  Crypto market is still in the billions.  Only a few percent of the public at large have ever owned any cryptocurrency.   In the US for example, only 2% of millennials have ever owned Bitcoin (the largest group of owners by demographic.)

It's pretty much prima facie that he violated title 18.
18 U.S.C. § 486:
Whoever, except as authorized by law, makes or utters or passes, or attempts to utter or pass, any coins of gold or silver or other metal, or alloys of metals, intended for use as current money, whether in the resemblance of coins of the United States or of foreign countries, or of original design, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

I think some of us here gave Godaddy some credit for reversing their position and backing what we wanted in the end.   If you boycott someone, they have a motivation to change their ways.

to me 
I actually like the idea of alternate forms money that are outside of government control. However, my point is that it will never supplant the dollar or gold. If bitcoins were widely accepted the government would lose revenue from sales taxes; and that won't go over too well with the states. They would find a way to shut it down. And, if accepted broadly, counterfeit bitcoins would appear readily and that would erode all confidence and destroy its purchasing power. I know u don't think it's possible, but I'm sure that nobody knows. If you are worried about central banks, just store your wealth in gold.

You're a little confused.  Human nature is this - for people to take action there has to be a certain level of benefit.  The greater the benefit, the more likely action will be taken.  If companies think that changing course has a great enough benefit, they will change course.
Think of it this way.  You want your mom to quit smoking.  You tell her, I'm not coming back to your house until you quit smoking.  She quits smoking.  You don't go back to her house, because you were mad that she was smoking in the first place.   She says screw it, and takes up smoking again.
