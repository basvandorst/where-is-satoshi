No doubt people have been trying to call a bottom since the spike and subsequent correction. The difference here is that the price has reverted to the norm. That is proven by the moving averages converging. We haven't broken the long term uptrend and the prospects of Bitcoin adoption and innovation couldn't be better. You don't make money investing in the euphoria phase. When it's the toughest to buy psychologically is when the opportunity to make money exists. Still a ton of risk but I'm a long term believer.

I'm from Pittsburgh and our goalie is Marc-Andre Fleury. I'm not even going to change it.

Because I just bought here and I want everyone else to as well.

Very cool of them. I just fear that calling it the Bitcoin Bowl will confuse people who don't know much about Bitcoin, which are the vast majority of people. Anytime someone asks me about Bitcoin I always have to spend 5 minutes explaining to them that its not a company or entity and that its like email in that no one owns it or controls it. This seems to be a hard concept for some people to grasp and this might make it seem like Bitcoin 'the company' sponsored the bowl.

This is a good explanation for its simplicity but I still don't understand how, given that the network knows purple and red they can't figure out blue.

I'm talking more about quantifying it. Like when the price tanks and everyone is freaking out someone could point out that investment and # of start ups are up 20%.

Using this for voting is really interesting.  I doubt it would ever be implemented but it would dramatically reduce voter fraud and save millions.  Unfortunately Bitcoin and the blockchain will continue to hit resistance because it flies in the face of the status-quo and the threatens the concentration of power in very few hands.
