Many people will soon realize their S9 mined the same amount of BTC as it costed (electricity incl.).
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:02:42
They'll make they own shitcoin ?
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:58:29
UGH MY EYES !!
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:06:51
Suggestion: Don't
Just buy BTC directly. You'll end up with more BTC than mining it.

I currently live in Quebec.
Price is 0.04$CAD/kwh - 0.06CAD$/kwh (depends on the period of the day)
That is for residential.
Commercial rates are ridiculously low.
I wish i had contacts. I could def. manage a mining project.
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:50:32
Why would this be better than their shitty fiat ? 
They'll control a crypto instead of paper. They have to be in control of it to control their economy (lower or increase monetary mass etc. and basically have economic policies).
Same shit.
If this was not a scam they'll use Bitcoin.

let your wallet closed so there is no constant rebroadcast.

Just dont mine imho.
Did it with antminer 180GH in 2014. Guess the result ?
Invested 4BTC. Mined 4.001 BTC at term.
Conclusion: Just buy bitcoins directly and save a ton of useless work.

@_date: 2018-01-08 03:21:14
Use bitcoin core 
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:17:16
And that's why you use Bitcoin core and not shitty products you don't even need.
Just imagine how safe are your bitcoins now.
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:18:46
Its simple, we kill the Bitman.
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:39:02
Pffff 200- 250$ Really ??
Nah I'd feel like I've been ripped off. Don't like that feeling.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:19:46
I meant there is no direct individual benefits running a node. You get nothing.
Beside a stronger and safer network which is not  a direct individual benefit (like mining which give you coins).
I am running a full node since 2014.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:24:42
I don't understand people using hardware wallets.

Its not that low so it might get confirmed in a few hours or days. If not it will be dropped from the mempool after a week i believe (it varies).

Holy wall-of-text.
Any tl;dr version ?
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:15:27
At least now more people know about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:50:00
Yes, mempool size, the number of unconfirmed transactions and ridiculous fees are the large obvious obstacles that everyone is trying to ignore and pretend everything is fine.
Having to wait 2 weeks for a transaction or having to pay 500$ in fees is not okay.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:38:08
47,987$ USD
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:13:49
Sold &amp; shipped by crytoHWwalletCOM
In short: Does not mean anything.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:47:15
Yeah withdraw limit is 0BTC if you are not advanced verified or whatever its called. There is basic verification which is a way to get you on the hook, then they say it failed then ask for the complete package (driver's license and all)
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:16:51
What ?
What is this pop phone... what ?
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:59:41
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand you got hacked.
Don't come crying when your coins go poof.
Keeping this in your phone, are you serious ?

"This is an unsustainable trajectory. It simply can’t continue."
Why not ? Not explained. Sure it can continue and it will.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:55:21
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:11:43
Yeah Bittrex is a scam. They let you deposit and when times come to withdraw they rub the 0BTC withdraw limit in your face.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:15:38
If you set the fee too low it might never get confirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:26:51
Nope don't care.
IF anything, its time to buy.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:16:16
One way long term volatility (cue: To the moon). Yeah
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:38:29

@_date: 2017-12-31 02:30:34
Do they make these in XXXXXXXXXXXXXXL
Maybe that is why that guy in Ukraine got kidnapped.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:02:51
I guess lol
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:32:34
lol'd at the last sentence.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:06:37
I do not think.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:25:49
Probably worth it then.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:10:10
Actually low fees mean more like no confirmations at all.
400 sat per byte would cost me 600USD fee for the lastest transaction i tried to do.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:22:55
BTC dev need to fix this crap ASAP.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:57:07
Nope LOL
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:04:06
Yeah its showing on the blockchain.
Bitcoins are actually completely unusable.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:05:10
I'll take good note of that. Sir.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:58:43

@_date: 2017-12-14 20:02:53

Very bad business practice.

@_date: 2017-12-26 01:04:17
Good. Good.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:56:36
Its called a satoshi. i'd start from there.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:37:27

@_date: 2017-12-31 02:13:05
I thought it would be a USB asic miner or something.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:57:07
3 weeks left to hit 20k.
Possible imho.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:19:03
Depends on the number of bytes.
For instance, someone who mined in 2014-2016 and has an address with 300-1000 inputs. Moving all coins could cost 500-3000$ in tx fee
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:53:21
RemindMe! 25 Dec 2018
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:56:44
Shiet, i have one stuck for 2 day with 8 sat/byte.
Paying 200 sat per byte brings the fee to 400$ for my transaction. Fuck that seriously.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:30:37
Updates are coming guise.
Will fix that.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:06:23
BECAUSE !
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:28:57
Pretty strong circumstantial evidence to me.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:42:08
Something along the satisfaction of ultimate triumph or success especially after being scorned or regarded as a failure.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:38:34
LOL Ver is actually Andreas's wingman.
IRS don't know what to think now.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:11:57
300-400 sat per byte for fast confirmation.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:09:48
How does replace by fee works. I mean i can initiate another transaction even if the wallet balance is 0 ? Since its gone in the other unconfirmed transaction ? I did not opt-in on the first unconfirmed transaction.
Forget accelerators lol.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:26:27
I'd say no unless privileged access to ASIC or free electricity.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:29:00
Dont panic sell. Thats all. And you failed.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:25:36
Too many transactions. Fees go up. Thats it.

@_date: 2017-11-27 02:07:50
There is none.
Network health. Good for everybody. Me included.
Hell it cost me 4watts/hour. (prob. 2-3 bucks per year)
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:42:33
Probably a both.
@_date: 2019-02-23 18:47:43
Looks legit af.
@_date: 2019-02-14 17:15:17
Step 1: Don't mine and buy BTC directly. This way you'll end up with more BTC than you would have putting cash into mining equipment.
Step 2: HODL.
@_date: 2019-02-28 17:08:01
Don't use a ledger would be a better title.
What if i told you that there is probably other "bugs" like this.
@_date: 2019-06-03 03:19:28
Interesting ! Indeed
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:16:03
2019 ?? more like 1919
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:26:00
This is not mining.
Its a simple relay that ensures the network is strong. It gives nothing to the person operating the node.
Google it.

@_date: 2017-11-27 00:34:15
1) nope. Longer the better for the network though.
2) 150GB download the first time then a few GB per day.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:58:36
Install anti-virus and let the bitcoin core run !
No particular risks. (i would not use that particular wallet for transaction since the computer is on 24/7 and accessible).
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:00:35
Easy. Just run the bitcoin wallet (Core) from bitcoin.org on a laptop or low wattage machine 24/7. See guides on google for adjustments.
That is it.
To see if its working : 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:49:06
I'd get an el cheapo netbook instead. Saves a lot of troubles and a lot easier to run on windows. 
Running a node on a Rasp. pi IS possible (Linux). Google it.

@_date: 2018-03-04 04:16:05
Did not even bother reading.
Here is the only bullish sign i need:
Price is going up since a week.
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:07:38
You did not lose anything.
You never owned it. 
Pheeva did own the BTC.
Use adresses that you only control/know the private keys.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:09:07
Yeah i know its not bitcoin and all but still funny how most exchanges go against all what bitcoin is about.
Coinbase is clearly an extension of the police state.
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:10:45
Backup wallet.dat
That was hard oof.
@_date: 2018-02-19 14:57:16

@_date: 2018-02-04 23:59:31
They don't need to.
People with fiat won't be getting them (for obvious reasons) so they will be available to buy form crypto people.
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:11:44
It easier sure.
Not safe though.
Exchange closes/gets hacked/steals.
Game over.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:36:35
Using a third party website based wallet on a mobile with more than 1BTC.

They have the duty to protect your shit so they steal it. Seems very legit.

Truth is you never owned any BTC.
Hardly got stolen.
You own nothing if you are not the only one controlling your private key. Is that hard to understand.. geez.
@_date: 2015-03-15 01:34:56
They can already freeze and seize your bank account whenever they want.
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:53:49

I would send that via registered mail and wait for their answer.

Download bitcoin core.
Encrypt wallet with a long passphrase.
Backup the wallet.dat (that is located in the bitcoin folder) on usb keys and hdds. 
That simple.
To gain access, drag on drop the wallet.dat into the same bitcoon core folder path on the same or another system and it will load.
Holy crap at the unnecessary bs in this thread.
