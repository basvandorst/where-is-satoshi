That's essentially utilitarianism, and I tend to lean toward 'do no harm'.  Several medical breakthroughs in the 20th century came from deplorable testing on humans during WWII, I'm not sure the benefits justify what it took to get them but I can still be glad we have them.  As far as ethics go, its always going to be: it depends.

Saying that it couldn't be that bad because of all the progress we made is claiming the ends justify the means. Not that I agree with them, but I don't typically agree with such logic.

I was working on a PCI project for one of our affiliates, ONLY focusing on 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3 of the PCI DSS and I have trouble seeing most companies pass just that.  Let alone the rest of the requirements on top of that.  Like you said, it is frustrating that many of the rules come down to an auditor's interpretation.

If you read what it takes to be PCI compliant it makes me fairly certain there is no company in the world that is 100% compliant.

Entering the market bit-by-bit, as in dollar cost averaging?  Most of the ideas you mention have actual names if you are unaware.  So how is it that you understand the concept of market manipulation but didn’t know what short-selling is?

Trump makes an executive order in his third term that trading bitcoin is considered treason and outsources enforcement to private prisons.
