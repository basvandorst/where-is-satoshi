I am one of the other affected users with the exact same issue, relating to a trade with BTC-OTC. I have been chasing this with Localbitcoins for a long time now. I am also about to pay a lawyer in Helsinki to take on the case. I will also be seeking damages. I’m planning a trip to Helsinki end of this month. Please get it touch so we can maybe help each other out.

Hi Ray. If you have contact with Nikolaus or Jeremias, perhaps you could advise them how your company legally seize bitcoins from scammers and return to the victims. It seems LBC are unsure or unable to legally proceed and so the case has stalled for some time.

I’m in same situation as OP. Tried through support ticket system, email, Twitter, LinkedIn.. even sent a physical letter to their offices via international post with tracking.
The few replies I have received from Max have been vague and also false promises of contacting police to explain the situation. They do not even specify how much I should claim (including BCH swap or not).

I am in the same situation as OP. I have already passed all KYC checks.
It seems Localbitcoins are able to return the coins but want us to force them through the courts before they do so.

Max @ LBC just emailed me about this situation. He said they have put more people working on this and will have an answer soon. I am hoping it gets sorted ASAP so I do not end up spending thousands on travel and legal expenses.

I was quoted much less, about €3,000 from a Finnish law firm and around £2,500-£3,000 from a UK based law firm. Both with some experience with crypto and finance.
This cost covers between 8-10 hours work by the lawyer. They claim to be able to get the job done, however no guarantees on how many hours it will take/cost.

Thank you for responding on this thread. I have not received any reply on ticket 397528 since Max opened it in December. Would you mind updating me with the extra detailed info on my support ticket? I am not aware of any further information apart from the message that states you have seized and recovered my coins. If there is further information on this case, could you please update my ticket?
Many thanks!

That’s correct. Max did contact me by email but these did not include any extra details about the case. Thanks for looking into it anyway. 
Yesterday I received a final email from Finnish police/NBI and UK police/action fraud, both I have forwarded to Max’s email.
I look forward to hearing from you guys soon.

Get in touch. I have same situation as you. Hopefully we can take LBC to Court. I have contact with UK and Finnish lawyers about this and am about to instruct them to take the case (after paying them thousands of pounds!)

I feel your pain. Next Wednesday will be 3 months without a reply on my support ticket.
I have been a LBC member for over 4 years and got defrauded of over 5 BTC some time ago, LBC told me they got my funds back last December and I should report to the police and file an asset seizure request. I followed their instructions and then it all goes silent. 
It is really odd because i would not have been aware of the recovered coins if LBC did not inform me. Maybe they decided to keep my coins instead of returning them? I have no idea what is going on. The worst part is the silence, not the length of time. 
I hope there is a rational explanation for the silence and delay. The only options I have left to chase it up are expensive and very inconvenient.
