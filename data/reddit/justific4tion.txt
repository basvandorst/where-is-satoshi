The funny part is, the ones who have the best chance of making it off the boat alive will be the people who have been rushing in recently to get rich quick.  Anyone using a private wallet who wants off will be screwed as mempool goes parabolic.

I'm not convinced that it is censorship resistant.  I think the US government could eventually crack down on bitcoin if it gains enough traction.  They could shut down US exchanges and prevent businesses from accepting it as payment.  Banks already report "suspicious" transactions to the IRS (which is pretty much all money transfers over a couple thousand $$) so they can also interfere with individuals using exchanges outside of the US to circumvent the ban.  They could also use their influence to pressure other governments to cooperate/follow suit.

This. If it didn't need a reason on the upside of the bubble, why does it need a reason on the downside?

Consider BTC is at $8000.  Market cap = 8000*21M = 168B
Now a trade happens at $7999.  Market cap = 167.979B
Change in market cap was $21M, but only required $7999 volume.  
Now apply this to many trades happening on a downtrend across all coins.  The difference in market cap is not equal to the trade volume in $.

Unfortunately it fails miserably at being a currency.

So in this analogy, coins = websites?  In that case, bitcoin = AOL.  It actually kind of works -- AOL was the gateway from offline to online.  Bitcoin is the gateway from fiat to crypto.  
The future looks bleak for bitcoin (and virtually all other existing coins) if the analogy holds.

Pump &amp; dump.

In your scenario BTC won't mean shit.  You better hope you are well armed.

Fun to watch in real time.

Take out as big a loan as you can and put it all on ~~black~~ bitcoin.

You probably shouldn't gamble with money you need to pay your bills.

Doubtful you'd be a multimillionaire: you probably would have sold after some early gains.  I imagine there are very few people, if anyone, who bought in 2009 and held until now.  They'd really have been crazy to without a crystal ball.

You're assuming the correction/crash is over...  maybe, maybe not.

US government is much more powerful than a lot of people in this sub seem to think.

How much did you lose?
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:29:26
Consider it a good lesson.  Don't put your entire life savings into high risk investments.

Why did you take an actual picture of your screen, rather than just print screen?

A gamble that paid off was still a gamble.  :P

There's a big difference between losing $10k and losing $1MM.  If you are young and your life savings are in the tens of thousands, then it would hurt but you could recover pretty easily.  If you're middle aged and lost millions then it's a different story.

Buying bitcoin is not investing, it's gambling.  It's like picking a single stock.  If you want a solid, long term investment, then diversify.
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:01:57
You and 100 other people living on bitcoin without banks doesn't make banks obsolete.  The majority of the world uses banks.
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:07:59
Your employer will not pay you in bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:29:34
Well, for one, by claiming that banks are obsolete.
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:31:57
It would be like asking to be paid in gold, or silver, or crude oil, or Apple stocks.  They will say no.  Why would they change their entire payroll system to accommodate paying you in a non-standard currency?
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:08:04
You're out of place in this sub.  Haven't you heard that bitcoin is a no risk guaranteed millionaire making machine?
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:26:02
You thought high risk speculative investments only go up?
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:18:19
Sounds like a gambling problem.

I think most people are here to get rich quick by doing nothing tbh.
