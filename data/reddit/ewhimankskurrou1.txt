Marketing strategies work.  Companies sell their products successfully by employing them.  Reddit is no different.  What you are describing is marketing via word-of-mouth.  That isn't a real strategy, and it's naive.
I wasn't suggesting we "spam" Reddit - quite honestly, we wouldn't even have the ability to have that level of impact.  All I was suggesting was a coordinated effort to allow us to upvote a few tips in key subreddits.
p.s. If people keep suggesting it in maybe it's not that flawed after all!
@_date: 2013-06-01 01:20:09
No dude, this is simply not applicable.  When you do business with a company and you have an account with them - that account is not "your property".  It is the property of the company you are doing business with and the gov't can absolutely seize it for criminal violations.  Similarly, if a company simply goes bankrupt, your "account" makes you just another creditor, similar to anybody else the company owes money to.

Yes, but a real trader would not do that for the exact same amount at the exact same price.  It wouldn't make sense - especially at nearly 1BTC.
@_date: 2013-05-24 18:29:35
No. MtGox requires 7.  Some have argued it should be more...
@_date: 2013-05-23 20:24:29
My philosophy is that any order more than 2 dollars away from the current price, is just bullshit.
@_date: 2013-05-24 18:32:10
Exactly.  This wouldn't be killing Bitcoin - it would be making us all rich and guaranteeing a successor cryptocoin.

@_date: 2013-06-01 21:14:14
MtGox does the conversion and always present a single order book to everyone.  HOWEVER, MtGox applies a 2.5% currency conversion fee.  So if your order on the EUR book your order will have your price, but when I see that order on the USD order book, it will be at a 2.5% worse price (so it'll likely execute on the EUR book first).
The impact of cross currency transactions is more apparent with less traded currencies - such as Thai Bhat.

@_date: 2013-06-07 13:44:39
What you are missing is that most of what is written on this subreddit is complete bullshit.  
The reason it goes up/down has nothing to do with inflation/deflation.  The inflation/deflation rate of the BTC currency is tiny tiny compared to the speculative pressures on the market.  
Let me put it this way, the BTC economy does maybe 50 million USD worth of business per YEAR.  That means if one BTC was worth one USD, the BTC would only need to change hands about 5 times PER YEAR to make that economy happen (again, at $1=1BTC).  ...and that ratio is still probably too low since a digital currency can arguably change hands many many times per day.
That means that at a price of $100/BTC, 99% of the market (at least) is purely speculation.  Speculation only markets are extremely volatile and cyclical.  ...the impact of inflation (which is around 10% per year now, but, you're correct, deflationary in the long run) is trivial compared to the -10% PER DAY swings we are currently seeing due to the speculative cycle.
@_date: 2013-06-07 20:30:18
Yes, but they wouldn't gamble on the Bitcoin price.  They are funding businesses that will earn income on service linked to Bitcoin.  There is no reason to expose themselves to the BTC price volatility.  If you look, none of the main businesses associated with the Bitcoin actually buy and hold bitcoin.

That's not really true.  In the cases of Liberty Reserve and eGold, the gov't seizures still allowed law abiding citizens to reclaim their funds (they were required to demonstrate their identity and reasonable evidence that it was not earned from criminal activities)
@_date: 2013-06-07 13:49:37
Current sales on all above markets combined = $4.37.   Who-the-f is going to convert their USD to BTC to make these kinds of purchases.  There are many 100 people in the whole world who actually EARN BTC.
@_date: 2013-05-23 22:42:18
Gee, what a coincidence; whenever there's a trading gap, a trade of exactly 0.95234249 occurs!
You can see the trading history directly on its website that during moments of no trading, they are injecting fake transactions of identical amounts just under 1 BTC... 
I believe they are trying to displace BTC-e as  in the exchange market by faking their trading volume numbers.  
I suppose it's easy for them to do since they can just execute fee-less trades between the bid and ask price when there is a spread.  ...but this really removes my trust in these guys...
@_date: 2013-06-07 14:50:51

@_date: 2013-06-03 02:36:06
...but who would hold BTC for a full month?  Any semi-intelligent business would liquidate their BTC immediately.  Given average BTC volatility, most businesses would go bankrupt every other month if they didn't.

hmm...  I don't think people are "waiting", I think there's more limited liquidity in the market now that Dwolla can't fund MtGox.   That was also the cause of the spread between MtGox and the other exchanges, wouldn't you agree?
@_date: 2013-06-07 15:19:56
I would put your BTC in an exchange to at least give yourself the option to sell.  They aren't going to get shut down in the next month as MtGox and BxCamp are publicly saying they're willing to follow the law and the gov't has said it's not looking to crack down as long as exchanges follow the law.
@_date: 2013-05-24 18:34:04

It was the opposite, and for good reason.  People were using CampBX to exit the market.
@_date: 2013-06-07 15:04:57
There's a big difference between the sellers and the buyers.  The buyers are buying 1, 2, 3 BTC to try and day trade on the volatility.  The sellers are comming in every 3-4 hours and dumping 1000 BTC at a time.
It speaks volumes...  It means the people with all the coins are trading out of the market slowly, while the newbies are fighting over the little volatility scraps (51% of them losing more money than gaining).
Eventually the most naive whales (cough Winklevoss') are going to realize their losing their shirt and will trip over each other to recover their remaining investment.
It's a long way down...
@_date: 2013-05-17 21:03:57
Some traders are running arbitrage between the exchanges, which really reduces the volatility overall.  There's currently a small spread against MtGox due to their Dwolla issue, but there's not nearly enough trading volume to indicate any exodus.
As far as "moving their money into another exchange"...  Most the other exchanges don't have sufficient liquidity to cash out much BTC at all - and their services are not very good.
@_date: 2013-05-30 13:57:34

Actually, I think it would make sense to prioritize processing of larger transactions over smaller ones.  Treating a $5 Trillion dollar transaction movement in the same queue as a $1 transaction, doesn't make sense to me.
That way the system scales along-side it's ability to process more and more transactions.

As the price drops miners are the first to sell out - so I would expect all the BTC on the sidelines to start selling soon.  It's not like there's a real "economy" that BTC is tied up in now.

**The motive:**  More volume -&gt; more publicity -&gt; more trust -&gt; more transactions -&gt; more transactions fees -&gt; **profit**.
**The evidence:**  These "trades" always occur right after a lull in trading when the bid/ask spread is wider, and that lot size you see in the image, 0.95234249, was never in the order book as an open order for bid or ask.

There are **millions** of active Reddit users, and only a fraction of them have ever heard of Bitcoin.  In reality, they are the perfect market for Bitcoin adoption/awareness.

I'm willing to donate the balance of my tip account (~$6.50), so that's at least 65 tips.  *You know what*, if enough people agree to do this with me, I'll throw a full BTC into it!  It'll be a **Tipping Bonanza!** That's 1065 TIPS!  I'll have to tell the wife I'm working late :)
