I'm lost. What are you people talking about? 8K, 17K, 1.4K? Where are you getting these insane numbers?

If you're going short term and you bought at less than whatever it's at right now, I'd sell. Buy again when the dip bottoms out. It's nowhere near in sight. Slight positivie correction just now, but it's bound to go down again structurally for the rest of the week. The media attention cuts both ways. The new people are all selling.

 has only 1 BTC left. We're in an upwards line again.

I bought at 2750, 200 turned into a lot less very quickly. Looking at the dots and slow but steady decline and slight positive corrections this looks like it's going to continue for half an hour at least. But that's fine, it's all in the game. I'm going for long term anyway.
The insane rise is over for now, though. I bought too late. The 3k+ at the end of the week projected by this sub is not realistic.
It just broke the 2300's and looks to be breaking 2200's in the next 2 minutes.

Three hours late, buddy. It popped.

And just after you say this, another loss of over a hundred dollars happens.

Do you still think this?

Okay so by now it's obvious that if you haven't sold yet, you better hold, right? They're about to plummet. 3k in June is completely unrealistic. If anything it's going to be 1.3k. Maybe in a year or two they'll get back to current levels.
Mark my words, 1.7k in five hours.

10%+ drop is hardly insignificant if you're going for shorts.

Do you realize that we just went down from almost breaking 2800 to 2400~ in the span of about 30 minutes? I have a feeling that people who bought in two hours ago aren't too happy.
I get that this sub tries to perpetuate positivity, but the best time to buy simply isn't always "now".

I bought for 200 at 2700~. Bought for 50 at 2350~. It luckily cancelled eachother out. I have 250 EUR in BTC now. Now let's get this shit in the green again!

7.4 coin, yeah. They differ from country to country.
