just like there's a fucking time traveler, jesus fucking christ people get a grip on yourselves. Invest responsibly and keep ignoring shitcoins.

There’s no way around it you have to disclose it

This literally happened in 2013  - markets dubbed it the ‘Taper Tantrum’  - and guess what? The markets got over it.
@_date: 2019-07-06 18:26:31
Yeah right let’s be real
@_date: 2019-07-23 18:10:31
Most retail investors will not self custody their crypto, period. Just like most people don’t keep their monies in their mattresses.
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:40:10
guys, simply being a bitcoin fanboy is not a valid argument - we need to have very frank discussions about this if BTC is to be taken seriously and not just be another libertarian fantasy. There is nothing stopping the Federal Reserve from using open market operations to decrease the money supply substantially or changing the reserve ratio as well. I think BTC serves well as a hedging tool since it is not correlated to traditional asset classes. I don't think currently it is stable enough to be used as a currency because it is too volatile - too many arbitrage opportunities exist between BTC and USD/EUR/etc and thus managing foreign/crypto exchange risk would be crucial - it's not as simple as supply and demand. Plus, you need more regulatory framework and scrutiny for it to be successful  - simply acting as your own custodian for BTC won't fly for most people - they will always use need a depository institution to hold their funds. I am frustrated because I want BTC to succeed but in its current state it is not enough for most people. Most people want convenience, quick access, and security. I am still long BTC.

It’s all up to you whether you think you’ll get more from Fortress than through bankruptcy
@_date: 2019-07-27 15:33:51
That’s not entirely true
@_date: 2019-07-07 03:40:16
Because bitcoin is treated as property here so you have to report gains and losses foh
@_date: 2019-07-15 04:28:01
This is fraught with so much disinformation I don’t even know where to begin.
@_date: 2019-07-06 18:24:10
Y’all are dumb

A liquidity crunch still is not something central banks look forward to doing even if it’s what they do when they buy bonds to inject liquidity into the market.
@_date: 2019-08-20 00:00:10
Stop using that word

The charts never lie
@_date: 2019-08-15 08:14:53
This is not the reason
@_date: 2019-10-19 21:23:36
By this same token, why don’t most people stash physical money in their mattresses? Most people custody their cash in depository institutions. All power to you that you can self-custody your assets - want a cookie? Again, most people will not do this.
@_date: 2019-10-13 18:27:27
Some of y’all never took any economics courses and it shows
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:11:29
If you read into Robinhood Crypto’s sections on their website they indicate they are working on the ability to withdraw your coins - no timeframe available.
@_date: 2019-10-19 17:12:36
I agree: most retail folks will not self-custody their assets so this notion of “not your wallet, not your bitcoin” is ridiculous. This is cumbersome, which is the entire reason for banks existing because they fulfill a need in the marketplace for secure storage of deposits and other assets. For crypto, the lack of insurance coverage is a major reason for retail customers not getting into crypto because assets are not insured like traditional assets with FDIC insurance or SPIC coverage for brokerage accounts, etc. What I struggle with is finding that happy medium whereby I can custody my own crypto at an exchange or bank but still hold full control as if I was the beneficial owner. I guess this could be similar to how participants hold stocks, for example in book entry at DTC under their nominee  but those assets ultimately property of beneficial owners. Sorry to ramble.
I work at a banking institution in the custody business line so these things come up with traditional assets all the time. Happy to explain further if anyone needs further explanation.
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:07:37
If someone read Robinhood’s website you’d know they are working on the ability to withdraw BTC to wallets in the future
@_date: 2019-06-25 00:10:57
Your honesty is refreshing
@_date: 2019-06-21 22:47:33
They’re not stupid, they should be more progressive just like our tax brackets instead of long term and short term gains if you ask me. 
If we don’t have taxes how will public services be funded? Let’s be real about this.
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:58:47
I think GBTC only trades OTC so maybe the ETF can trade on NYSE Arca or some other exchange that have more liquidity.
@_date: 2019-06-13 22:50:34
Great more garbage
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:13:55
It was mostly for the others....but yeah I’m waiting too. They’re a little busy trying to go public in a few years
@_date: 2019-12-26 19:30:27
YEAH DELETE ALL THE SHITCOINERS OFF YOUTUBE
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:38:02
Yes I agree more I’ve been waiting for a pullback
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:21:04
This seems fake especially with the horrible formatting
@_date: 2019-09-04 04:52:23
Stop calling it an ETF because that’s not what it is
@_date: 2019-09-04 17:38:04
I use Celsius instead of BlockFi but only for USDC since it provides better rates than my savings. (Yes I know it isn’t FDIC insured but I don’t work day in and day out for 2% interest on my savings)
@_date: 2019-09-04 17:36:38
Report this motherfucking shit
@_date: 2019-09-18 23:20:41
Total shitpost why is this on here
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:49:43
What part of private and confidential did you not understand????
@_date: 2019-09-07 00:46:51
That’s cuz you’re using BofA which relies still on ACH or EFT to Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-09-02 19:16:41
I think definitely before the next halving. I think if you’re doing an ACATS to another broker that supports crypto they might let you withdraw provided the assets are received appropriately.
@_date: 2019-09-16 15:25:32
I don’t listen to Tom Lee.
@_date: 2019-09-04 11:14:39

@_date: 2019-09-07 13:32:07
if you use any traditional bank they all use ACH and EFT or Wire Transfers  - you're not going to get away from this that is just part of the process, this is not a feature of any cryptocurrency. I use my traditional bank to deposit money but it does take time, which I am fine with.
@_date: 2019-09-07 16:08:23
Wah wah wah

Don’t be a pussy when it goes down just buy more.

They are currently working on solutions for being able to withdraw your crypto at this time, though obviously they do not do so at this time. See link below:

You can already buy fractional shares from a number of brokers out here in these streets.
