I think these people could give less of a shit about two cents of doge if they lost $26,000 on gox.

I don't trust their design capabilities.

These "what x thinks I do" comics are 100% shit, but this one is quite accurate.
@_date: 2014-03-20 14:23:01
Haha, no, unless you have a strong following of fools.

Oh the social injustice of one experience!

Can someone explain how additional merchants affects the market? Seems like it has the opposite effect that we would expect.

@_date: 2014-02-25 15:54:44
This is actually good news! 
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:50:06
That sucks.

That's the stupidest combination I've ever heard in my life! That's the kind of thing an idiot would have on his luggage!

How much USD equivalent did you invest?

Extensive verification processes are the enemy :D

Social feels aside, I found it pretty funny that, *at* a bitcoin convention, he was bewildered she knew of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-15 03:14:15
I must have upset eight masochists
@_date: 2014-03-21 14:17:07
What is the address?
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:41:59
It is painful to see how much of a dumbass the anchor is. Sadly, she is more informed than most people who don't understand bitcoin. Patrick handled it very well.

Some people need to overcome the phobia of sending their first bitcoin out of their coinbase wallet. Coinbaseophobia

I love stamp. Stampy stampy stamp. Here it goes down, down into my belly.

A shortcut to a textfile in the same folder, extremely suspicious behavior. If the phisher had been smarter, he would have had a nice folder structure with shortcuts at the base folder.

Agreed, most would not respond to that if he wasn't attractive enough.

I bought some when it was 300 and considered it cheap. Now the money is gone. Womp.

Props! Looks fantastic.

Why did you bother to post this? Is this what r/bitcoin is for?

You didn't get any shares of HTTP?? Time for an HTTPRegret subreddit.

Sweet! One bitcoin for my work! I just made a thousand dollars!








@_date: 2013-11-27 19:42:00
The reoccurring question is "how does bitcoin work? There's nothing there!" Like the other posters here, I am the sole person with interest in it on my floor.
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:46:27
I am quietly raging, waiting for my first coinbase transaction to complete, while the price has risen 300 from when I bought...0.01 btc... v.v

@_date: 2013-12-05 15:38:46
Soooo, business as usual
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:27:48
Whatever it is, we are about to see a huge jump!
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:46:31
Wheres the sauce

Anyone that did that really needs to have someone else manage their money.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:48:47
That is why I havent gotten any, the wait is too much to bear. Waiting for the 10 btc instant buys
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:37:37
The real question is, what is the dealership doing with that 216 BTC? :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:47:51
They will only continue to shake their heads in disbelief :)
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:06:52
Only a few months out ;)
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:50:18
Check the article picture. Made me chuckle.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:03:41
each of these dips :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:52:40
I don't see any other reason for the teacher to act like this. I've talked to other ignorant people who share the same limited knowledge on bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:00:30
such formats
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:37:25
Someone up the chain has a vested interest now, I doubt the reporters have the time or drive to jump in themselves.
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:39:35
I think the ~50 people with a quarter of the bitcoins in existence could care less about their political affiliation unless we see some regulations coming into play.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:04:42
I thought this was for Bitcoin news, not "Look what I can do!" Carry on.
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:40:21
It is not an awkward moment, it is a redpill moment. Many will pass the opportunity by, few will bite.
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:13:16
 will help get you started :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:23:45
such similarities
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:14:49
Yes, the question is, how low to buy?
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:36:29
Ah, the perfect turnaround to catch the viewers eye; "Bitcoin is the best thing ever - must read!" when all they have been hearing about is the scams and theft.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:05:38
I wanna know more about this lifestyle 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:03:31
Lucky you got it at the current price. Whole thing worked out well in your favor, granted that bitcoin stops crashing.
