Nah, after high school you're allowed to make different friends..
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:47:54
Wait, you think I'm a troll for telling you that not everyone becomes an asshole when you're rich? Yeah you have an extremely cynical view of what friends are and what being rich is. Might want to check my post history. Definitely not poor lol

Lol please read up on Vancouver. Your ignorance and lack of education are showing.
In case you didnt know, the word argument has more than one meaning. Please do some research before getting so worked up over nothing.

Youre right. Screw other people who has time for them when you have bitcoins, amirite?
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:49:23
Nah for not being yourself. If you think your friends aren't going to be your friends just because you're rich, you need better friends.
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:46:27
Lol your friends must love you.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:48:46
You're quoting an anonymous person lol
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:07:14
You have a cynical view of it. Not everyone is a mooch. Get better friends.
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:47:41
Lol you've never been rich before clearly
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:30:56
I can tell you didn't go through it hard enough. I mean that would just be impossible in that short amount of time. I talk about my life in Mexico and how I have property in Vancouver Canada where the median price for a home is over 1 million. I'm not sure why you're arguing about this rather than your point about losing friends when you're rich. Instead of being used, most people rather help their friends out. Weird concept eh?

Why do you know shitty people?
