So far I see nothing as a normal consumer that would push me to use Bitcoin. The Cash app by square does all the benefits of that have been besides the sending money out of the country. I haven't been out out the country in 10 years so that is not a big concern to me. And Cash app doesn't charge any fees not even the 7¢ bitcoin does. 
For me the biggest draw to bitcoin until it becomes more widely accepted is just like mint.com labels it as an investment. Most people in order to get bitcoin will have to pay an exchange fee anyway so the only way right now to make that viable is to have it increase in value.

I agree but coinbase was the exchange that started me in Bitcoin so they have a special place in my heart... Of course if my first exchange was Mt. Gox I might not feel that same way.
