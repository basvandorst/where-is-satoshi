Shameless plug - we take bitcoin.
But keep in mind, even a $25k touring bike may shortly be a "$100k" bike if BTC keeps on this tear.

Just because we don't need to pontificate doesn't mean we aren't here. ;)

Not good enough. Voldemort separated his soul into 7  horcruxes.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:53:51
We need to use a smaller unit or people will be intimidated by the perceived high price of entry. You should say 7 Half-ears.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:29:25
Funny, I'm female, and constantly trying to educate my male peers on BTC. And as a buyer responsible for over a million dollars in inventory and a sizeable staff, I resent the implication that I am somehow raking "the fruits of the pyramid."
Seems like I'm planting those fruits tbh.

All the people telling you her reaction is your fault can pipe down. I'm a chick, and it makes no sense to me why she would react this way.
If she knows you've invested everything and have made 6x your wage this month via that investment, why is she not interested? Seems like it's pretty important to you. Should be important to her.

A day late, but certainly not a dollar short.

Reminds me of this story. Maybe contact the person who wrote the article and see if they still have the contact who helped them?

As a woman invested in crypto, and working for the first Harley Davidson dealership in the US to accept bitcoin, I must agree. I wouldn't want someone as emotional as Jamie Dimon handling my money.
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:15:47
It looks like there's a dealership in Texas that does!
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:44:12
Darn, sorry to hear that. That directory site seems to be a little outdated - I haven't been able to get us listed there because their help desk is down.
Yes! If there is a particular bike you're looking for, we can locate it and ship it to you. I can put you in touch with our Sales Manager, and if there is anything in particular you want on the bike we can also install it before shipping.

What a strange photo choice.

I work for Old Road Harley Davidson in Santa Clarita, CA, and we are now accepting Bitcoin for bike purchases. To my knowledge, we are the first Motorcycle dealership in the US to do so. That being the case, there isn't a lot of info for new Bitcoin merchants on how to get the word out.
Is there a directory you use to find out where to spend your bitcoin? Which is your favorite? Which Social Media platforms do you prefer? Any and all feedback is appreciated!
@_date: 2017-09-30 02:22:16
No, Harley Davidson dealerships are all independently owned and operated, but we can arrange shipping! To my knowledge we are the only HD Dealer in the US taking Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:12:47
That goddamn Loch Ness Monsta.
@_date: 2017-09-06 23:52:58
Yep! We were just approved for processing $100,000 USD/day through Bitpay, so we are excited and ready to process the first Bitcoin bike purchase. :)
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:30:53
Was this a new bike at a Dealership? I know this isn't the first bike to be sold at bitcoin, but to my knowledge we are the only HD Dealership accepting this. This is why I specified "new".
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:12:42
Added to coinmap.org yesterday.
Our Dealer Principal is acquainted with the General Manager of the Lamborghini dealership in Newport Beach that accepts bitcoin. It has increased their sales by 2 units per month average. That may not sound like much, but that is roughly $150k/mo. in volume. Of course we don't expect anything like that to happen, but we do want to make ourselves as visible as possible. :)
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:34:22
We have a gray 2018 Fat Bob in the dealership now, and it looks awesome. Grey denim. I haven't seen the  other color you chose yet but it looks great in the builder.
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:01:28
That would be great if it's not too far a drive for you. Are you in LA County? We will need to know your county in order to calculate registration and sales tax. 
I've passed along your bike build to Dave, he is working on finding the bike for you. If you'd prefer to share your information privately, my email is MCManager

Well, my BTC has "only" doubled since I bought in, where my LTC has tripled in the same span of time.
@_date: 2017-09-30 04:37:37
Very true, though they don't accept Bitcoin. Our shipping fee varies by state but is usually under $1000. Hopefully some day it will be an easier (and more economic) process.
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:56:47
Good choice. I'm really liking the blacked out look we're seeing lately - it's standard on some models starting this year.
Unfortunately in CA there isn't a way to get a 2-into-1, we aren't allowed to sell them. There are some Aftermarket options but we wouldn't be able to sell or install it. I'd talk to Dave, our Sales Manager. He may be able to point you in the right direction. (661) 964-0506.
Glad you're close enough to make it down to the dealership, it would save you the shipping fee!
My name is Patrice, I'm the MotorClothes Manager. Let me know if I can answer any other questions for you.

Just a basic difference of ideology - people who see the volatility of a new market as risk vs. those who see it as opportunity for exponential growth.
Those people don't realize that the BTC market can be extremely reactive while BTC itself remains robust due to its innovative nature.
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:22:29
Give us a call any time! Hodl on and keep the shiny side up. :)
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:12:24
Dudette ;)
And you're correct! Old Road Harley Davidson in Santa Clarita, CA.
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:28:49
A new bike at a Dealership? I'd love to hear more about that! I know there have been plenty of private party sales of bikes, just not inside of Dealerships. That's why I specified "first new Harley".
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:27:47
That would be about $405 per bitcoin, and coingecko is showing prices that month as being in the range of $395-$450, so very possible.
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:21:32
Welcome! Though I'm not much less of a newbie than you. 27F merchandising manager, who also works with cryptocurrency as part of my job at a motorcycle dealership that accepts it. 
Yeah, being a chick interested/invested in BTC can be a varied experience. I bring up cryptocurrencies to other women as often as I can; we'll never reach mass adoption if only half the population is interested.
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:21:28
It's almost as if people bought into a volatile new market, and it is in fact demonstrating some slight volatility.
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:05:41
Let's say you had bought at $4300 and the price dropped to $3500. Do you buy, sell or hold?
If you say hold, then what you are really saying psychologically is that you don't believe the price will go down further. If you do think the price will go down further, then you should really sell and then determine if you want to buy in later at a lower price. That makes sense right?
Not to me. If I bought at $4300, and it dropped to $3500, and I felt that it would drop further (but rise again shortly), I would hold. If I bought at $4300 and sold at $3500, I would lose $800 of my original investment. I might choose to buy more in addition to my original investment, but I wouldn't sell.
Am I missing something here?
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:41:46
This is awesome! I work for a Harley Davidson dealership that is now accepting bitcoin. Would we be able to list some of our bikes on here?
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:27:07
You need to get that out of Coinbase stat. Before the fork. it will be converted to Bitcoin 2X and depreciate like a stone in a well.

It's Q3 going into the holiday season?
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:03:06
We'd love to have you! Our store owner is very interested in cryptocurrency, I'm sure he'd love to chat with you.
@_date: 2017-09-20 16:26:06
Did you get your soda?
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:28:18
Dude, don't recommend holding in Coinbase. After the fork next month, all BTC stored in Coinbase will be converted to Bitcoin 2X, and likely depreciate.
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:35:43
We just sold our first bike this week (no markup), but our store owner prefers to immediately exchange to USD to prevent the accounting nightmare that holding it would create. I believe he has a seperate bitcoin venture and plans to hold, and I am doing the same in my off time.
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:53:33
Lol, it won't be 'going towards mass adoption' if it's only educated men (generally white men in their 20's-40's) getting on board. Hell, not even if most men period start investing.
Women make up 47% of the total US workforce, and more than half of management and supervisory positions. It's imperative to get them hooked on BTC too.
