Wow only 7,400 running I'm shocked. I never rely thought about it but would have guessed a much higher number.
I've been running one on my desktop for months. Other than the initial hit to my drive space I haven't even noticed it's running.
Apparently I'm an ass though and have been running it without forwarding the port. Liked like it was working. Didn't realize I've been sucking up connections. I'll fix that ASAP.

Thanks for everything you do and I'm excited to see another big name accepting bitcoin donations. 
You're right about the ability for micro donations to be easily sent and really add up.
Also thank you for making the email optional and making it easy to donate.

Yeah I guess I just suck at estimating. I know it's not mainstream and overall has a relatively small following (that is growing). I just thought it'd be higher, not sure why.

I hope this is okay to post here. It just recently came out. It's a general history podcast episode about the history of currency in America. There is a lot of discussion about Bitcoin though.

Great video thanks for posting. I've read and watched a lot about Bitcoin. I agree this is one of the most clear breakdown of it's basics that I've seen.

To run a full node the blockchain alone is more than 100gb so you'll need 60 more gigs of storage.
I love DO and have a $5 VPS myself. Because the drive space requirement it's not cost effective for me to host a full node there.
