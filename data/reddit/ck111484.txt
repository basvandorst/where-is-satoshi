Checked it out... any chance of getting screwed on there? I haven't gone through the whole process but it seems like you could give them your gift card details and then they never send you any Bitcoin.

I'm sure I screwed up somehow, but that does not excuse or change the fact he is a scamming  scumbag, or that now I have $5 in my Bitcoin wallet instead of $95.

That sound like a lot of time and effort. I'm trying to make a purchase ASAP.

Not following.

Which wallets? You mean Coinbase and Blockchain? I know about Coinbase (I actually deposit bitcoins into my Coinbase wallet and then transfer them into my Blockchain wallet because I haven't figured out how to deposit hem directly from ATM-&gt;Blockchain, haha (newb, I know). But I thought Blockchain was really good?

No kidding! Wow, thanks, I'm going to give them a call tomorrow and see if they'll do it just to make sure. Something like that is exactly what I was hoping for!

I tried, it didn't want to take a gift card. Said number was invalid. Unless I did something wrong
@_date: 2019-12-28 20:36:44
Where might I find a local Bitcoin exchange? Sorry, outside of Bitcoin ATMs I'm pretty clueless.
@_date: 2019-12-29 00:39:38
Yeah, I noticed :/ Like $39 worth of Bitcoin for a $50 gift card. It'd still give me enough for what I want to buy, but sucks getting gouged like that.

Unfortunately I don't have a bank account at the moment :( Long story

Welp, looks like I got completely screwed by trying to trade for Bitcoin here on Reddit by "hidude1212". Awesome dude, scamming someone out of their $100 gift card Christmas present. I suppose there's no recourse I can take, is there?
@_date: 2019-12-30 05:35:39
I tried posting and it was immediately removed :( I think I don't fit some of the criteria (probably for quality posts, lol)
@_date: 2019-12-30 22:10:35
After some research, it looks like I can just buy straight from Coinbase with a Visa gift card. Anything wrong with that?
I just want something fast and easy.

Wow, thanks for the awesome reply!
I use CoinATMRadar to find Bitcoin ATMs where I just load cash into my wallet l, but I've never seen (or at least noticed) any way you could use them with a debit/credit card... is this possible at some of them?
Otherwise I will give some of your other suggestions a shot. I'm really looking for the fastest/easiest way possible, since I'd like to make a Bitcoin purchase ASAP, so bar being able to use a Bitcoin ATM with a card, exchanging them online seems like the best bet.
I used to use Coinmama all the time to buy Bitcoin, but I thought they stopped you from being able to use cards...? I don't remember exactly, there was some reason I stopped using them.

I get it. I really don't need this right now, I'm  pissed off at myself as is.
@_date: 2019-12-31 18:52:57
Yeah, I'm just especially mad because I'm really hard up for money right now and nothing makes me angrier than when I screw up. That Bitcoin was really important to me. 
Don't worry, I won't be paying anyone for Bitcoin ever again.
@_date: 2019-12-31 03:10:46
Yeah :( He fooled me with his fake "verified trader" tag and positive feedback, but now that I look at it it was probably just him using fake accounts.
I REALLY needed that Bitcoin. Should have trusted my gut and done more research on buying from a legit website.
@_date: 2019-12-31 08:17:16
I'm stupid and have too much faith in humanity I suppose. Never again.
@_date: 2019-12-31 03:20:20
Yeah, I'm just a newb and didn't really understand how to do it, and he PMd me wanting to trade, and his history at a glance looked legit. I know better now :(
