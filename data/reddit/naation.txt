I feel I'm going to cry. The first step is to accept greed as a normal human sentiment, and stop looking at Bitcoin as a philosophical, epic, battle between evil and good. Its all about money and to respond to the real mass markets who are the real drivers everybody here has to lose the libertarian poetic bs and start building for regular consumers.
Lose the tech jargon too.

Fiat currencies are a great success and are not nearly, in the process, nor will be in any danger. Bitcoin is a great value reserve, but difficult to implement as a currency for it 10 minute delay in confirm, silly decimal points (0.00003467 WTF!!), the fact that it depends on millions of dollars of miners, and its centralized "core" developer dependence.
These thing can be changed and should be so Bitcoin can be a currency and not just a value reserve.

This is a very high risk experiment by the Fed in my opinion. But extremely interesting nevertheless. It seems that in a big economy where the fiat currency is widely adopted outside its borders the market gives it more credit and velocity doesn't accelerate the way it would (and does) in economies with bad track records like Argentina and Venezuela.
Also, it seems that total money supply is not growing because people are not using the money created by the central bank. This is happening in Japan and Europe too, very interesting because in my mind it changes the supply/demand paradigm and how people behave in terms of supply vs demand vs price. ITS NOT THAT MECHANICAL.

This is very long for me to digest I just wan't to know if this is the same as any broker dealer/bank regulation, more or less?
By the way: this kind of regulation kills any startup and entrepreneurial activity.This is great for established players like banks, investment banks, broker dealers, etc. But forget innovation and competition.
