Pretty sure that is exactly what Monaco is offering.  1% Cash back on all purchases for the lowest lock up card.

This is a stopgap solution to use your crypto in a fiat world.  Your position is idealistic and not realistic.  Even if BTC adoption continues we're atleast a decade from replacing fiat.  
Edit:  For a lot of people this will get their feet wet in the space and get people to dive deeper.  Any adoption (even this) is good for the entire space.

Eventually the wallets will route payments through the best possible channels and methods.  You won't know you're using LN, it'll just be you sending money to someone.  It could very easily be to the point where you just enter a username and don't even need a public key.  
Imagine the number of protocols interacting and routing that go on for you to view a website.  It didn't start that way, but as time goes on it improves.

Personally I'm still buying.  It would make sense to dollar cost average over a few weeks and gradually build your position.  
I don't think prices are high right now, I think we're consolidating and will see further increases down the road.

As it stands now?  No.  BTC Exchanges don't even run on BTC.  Front running would be a big issue, as well as transaction speed.

It's an old statement, from months ago.  And he's said the same thing of anything tech related, and admitted he doesn't understand technology.  If you look behind the scenes though, you should follow actions not words.  BNSF in the BiTA.

There's enough of this on Twitter that you can't even read responses anymore.  Do you really need to try it on Reddit too?
