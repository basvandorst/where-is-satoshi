Say GPG is your house and bitcoin your bank. 
If you use a specific lock for your house, you can use the same key to open both your house and bank ;)

It is not desirable for security purpose since we are extracting private key from GPG. Script would need to be extended to deal with key encryption/decryption.
This is a first step in trying to use an OpenPGP card as hardware wallet. Next will be to use middle ware to communicate directly with the card instead of GPG and hopefully sign transaction without touching private key.
You can also imagine PGP keys becoming a bitcoin address linked to a PGP id/email and send bitcoin just like you send a PGP encrypted email.

Why would they indeed?
I wonder as well, and my only ideas is that they are either really not checking their sources either part of the scam...
I contacted NewsBTC about that to get there feedback. Their post was clearly promoting perbtc.com and disappeared soon after webdotcom took the site down...
No feedback so far... Wait and see...

After a week and two mail to NewsBTC I still did not get any reply which makes me suspicious.
Are those market watcher just copy/paste idiots or are they part of the scam?
Unfortunately I have no copy of other news site than NewsBTC but I would like to investigate a bit further and see if I can find any correlation/leads. Can anyone send me copy of article mentioning perbtc.com ?
