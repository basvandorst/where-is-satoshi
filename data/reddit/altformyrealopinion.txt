So if I'm a major mining outfit that has a bunch of stolen coins, couldn't I just circulate them exactly like this until it's all spent, and gets recovered as clean mining fees? Since I'm a big miner I'll collect a good amount of those fees. There's a loss involved, but I'd be getting a pretty good return of laundered coins as fees that way.

This. At today's prices I paid $5000 shipping for a 30 megahash usb miner back in the day. :(

I bought at $319 in 2013, oh no I temporarily lost 3 months of gains.

I've had a crazy tinfoil theory for a while now that someone somewhere who has a large percentage of mining capacity at their disposal is using transaction fees to launder stolen bitcoin. You have a huge amount of stolen coins, how do you get to them? If you've got a major slice of the mining pie you cycle payments over and over with huge transaction fees, and mine a percentage of the fees. You won't get it all, but over the very long term you'll recover a percentage of the stolen coins as clean mining fees.

I sold at $1295, trying to gain more bitcoin  in the upcoming drop because i knew we wouldn't hit a new ATH. So of course it jumps to a new ATH.
You're welcome.

Bought at 120 and held for 6 years, through Mt gox even. I finally get the nerve to sell at 1300 and rebuy more on the dip, and this happens literally days later. 
Most depressing 1000% profit ever.

I bought at $120 and held for 6 years, and the *one* time I decide to sell some at $1300 and rebuy when it drops to try and gain more, this happens. I held all through Mt. Gox and everything in between. 
So you're welcome for the price increase, clearly this was punishment for my selling.
Most depressing 1000% profit ever.
