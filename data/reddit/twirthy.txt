Awesome. Thanks so much. I greatly appreciate the rapid response. And yep, it took me awhile to burn the words into my mind but I've got them secured-- short of a tramautic brain injury.

Update:  I resynced my wallet and the previous balance appeared however I am still confused as to whether I will receive payments coming in to my old address. Any input on this would be greatly appreciated. Also, in the event that I can no longer receive payment from the old address does anyone have a recommendation for a wallet for a homeless person that doesn't erase the address without permission of the user?

Yeah, I'm not much a fan of address reuse but I'm not much in a position yet to procure multiple qr codes. That's one disadvantage of being highly mobile.  That and McDonald's laggy wifi. And as far as remembering the words: just create a sentence that uses all of them--simple.

I read the link you posted and it does raise privacy concerns. It makes sense now why governments are hellbent on kyc/aml at the digital currency on ramps.  So if I go to spend my micro pennies on socks and toothpaste the transaction will show all the numerous addresses the  btc came from. Does that mean I can go to jail if someone tipped me 0.20$ from an address that had ever received funds that had been considered stolen? It doesn't make sense that criminals would ever use computer money when it is so easy to trace.
