People don't seem to understand that it's miners who decide not anything else which coin will survive...Or if both will
You better hope it's not too profitable to mine it, because that will kill BTC

At some point. . .. That we can't even imagine right now
So why would we take this step in 2017? It ameks no sense to piss on what took us from a 1 dollar to 3000
I grant the theoretical here. But we're not there. 
And even if we were BTC NEEDS BIGGER BLOCKS YOU HAVE SEEN PROOF. 
Segwit/lightning will reduce the need for constantly enlarging blocks. Not make it go away entirely. 
Lightning providers need to be able to move their BTC too, and with an ever expanding network the need for larger blocks will grow and grow.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:47:23
You're very confsued
It was centralization that saved the chain. . .. One pool owner decided he didn't want to do what was profitable. Without slush pool there would have been probably 0 or near 0 blocks mined
If it's not profitable to mine NO ONE should be mining it. You don't buy hardware to mine as a charity. 
It was only pool centralization that kept any blocks flowing at all
And all miners want centralziation becuase it' makes their profits easily predicable. THe smaller hash rate your pool/node controls the more sporadic your payments will be and the more time you'll need to reach your projected income (or less if you're lucky)
I don't want 1 BTC this week and 5 the next. I want 3.5 every week on a schedule preferably. . .

Ver has been around a long time
And black market boys aren't fans of segwit lol
You think they care about lightning network? Yea let's trust some liquidity provider that should probably be regulated under US law to facilitate my transaction in ill gotten BTC. . . .Does that sound like something you would do if you were a criminal? 
I'd put my bet on the some one in the core team getting hurt before Ver by some bad hombres. If the bottom falls out on core no one is gonna blame Ver. They're gonna blame the guys who refused to put EDA in an let the chain die
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:59:48
Yea I live a sheltered life. . . 
Says teh guy who thinks big boys are invested in bitcion. . who do you think is a player here?
The market cap is so small. Big players play with other peoples money, if they're in it's not with their $$
You need to leave whatever delusional land you live in. Bitcoin is a small small thing dominated by early adopters and people seeking privacy. No one else who could amass wealth would keep or leave it in such a volatile market. 
I'll say it again. Why would anyone hurt ver? What would they gain? 
Nothing. 
You're just a white boy with no perspective. . . .

@_date: 2017-11-14 21:09:21
We can't scale to Visa levels if the lightning providers can't move their BTC aroudn. People seem confused.
For lightning providers to have BTC to exchange they need to be able to move it around. So under an attack like this lightning will come to a standstill as well very quickly. 
Segwit/lightning reduce the overall blockspace that will be required deep into the future of BTC. It will not eliminate the need to increase block size. . . If the cap remains the fees are going to be so high mining won't be about getting "normal" block rewards any more. Just getting your hands on those a piece of those fees.

Difficulty adjustment and bigger blocks
like every other POW coin
node size increases are not a problem, memory and bandwidth get cheaper every year there is no reason it can't scale. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:48:49
Why would you imagine today's fees matter?
Nice worthless anecdote *wonders if you understand what a fee market is*
I don't even put the coins in cold storage anymore. . . . It's too risky the chain si so bad
edit - and to you people who can't read. . ."the fees" again do not relate to his anecdote. lol
We hit all time high fees on blocks just last week. How dense can you be? 
You core supporters are so obscenely uninformed. Go use the coin more than once a year and then come back. . . 
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:02:43
Yea fees generally, not the fees he paid on his one transaction of probably no BTC that was him just moving funds around.
Of course he didn't try to make a transaction with another party because that would be insane the way the chain is running right now. He'd just convert to a more useful currency to make a transaction. . . 
Do you not understand what an anecdote is and why it's not important in this context? Just ridiculous to even bring it up. 
We had more rewards on the fees than the block last week. . . . All time high fees. No one cares about you kids moving around pennies. . . . Some of us like to have confidence we can move our coins and how much that is gonna cost. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:33:37
Yea did you guys take a fucking vote?
I doubt it
Granted it may be a given that Slush's stance on this is clear and you all expected this. . . / IDK the details or even how the profit worked out. 
So maybe you made the right call. Or maybe you saved your portfolio and the mining in that moment wasn't all that important relative to the bigger picture of your wealth. . . .
But you're not a charity don't get all sanctimonious. Don't lie either 
Because you're either lying or you're stupid. And I doubt you're stupid 
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:21:36
If you think all those Tx's coming up are just random you're confused. .. . . 
When there is an attack going on peopel want their money on exchanges. . . So the block chain blows up because peopel are moving their BTC out of cold storage. Or trying anyway. 
You honestly think everyone just placidly watches this? They don't need to fill up the blocks it's organic. 
People are such fools
Voltality = money. And if the price is volatile the blocks are gonna start to fill. Combine that with a hash lowering and no one has to do anything. . . . . It's why raising the block limit makes sense. And adding some sort of difficulty adjustment algo
These guys all know when teh pump is coming they're very aware fo the EDA. . .they had moved their funds long ago. What you're seeing is the rest of us reacting. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:18:36
Think back to your standardized tests. . .lol
I think we both know you can't read you naive and ignorant little shit
"profit doesn't' dictate what we mine"
Slush says it does, surprise. Anyone sane would
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:20:35
So let's say that it was a spam/ddos attack
(which it is not lol you think peopel aren't moving their coins out of cold storage en masse? maybe they started it when the fees were low but once they get high no way that's spam, those are people trying to get on exchanges)
Either way we're vulnerable 
Tripling the block size would make it much more expensive to do (again assuming this was all an attack which it obviously was not most of those transactions were "legitimate" as you would define them)
Still need bigger blocks
Segwit/lighting doesn't stop that
And it is a solution, it's just not a permanent solution. 
The biggest draw back to raising the block size is having to do it all over again x amount of time later. 
Relative to givking up market share to LTC/VTC or opening up to regulation it seems like the much more rational path to those of us who don't have some odd hard on for tech no one cares about. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:08:28
Bitcoin core has all these problems in spades. . . .
Reliant on the same miners. (no bigger blocks do not make mining more centralized, miners wanting consistent profits makes the system more centralized, block size is irrelevant next to that concern for miners, it's why no one runs their own node to mine anymore)
The downsides to bigger blocks are a few extra tb hard drives on nodes and the constant discussion of if and when to increase block size limit. (anyone worried about free block space is an idiot, no a few hundred dollars ins't going to change whether or not you run a node) The other concerns are minor
The downsides to segwit and lightning are endless. Regulation, risk, giving up market share, and just the obvious of if segwit was so great why the hell isn't LTC number 1? And we're going to make it easier for people to get rid of their BTC and swap it into shitcoins? 
We didn't get from nothing to here because of segwit. 99% of that growth is from a basic POW coin. 
And this centralziation problem is in no way solved by lightning/segwit. And lightning providers still needs blocks to flow . . . . 
If you really think BTC is "digital gold". You'd want to avoid playing with the formula that got all these people buying into it. If people were buying BTC for the tech again another coin would have passed it longggg ago. Like LTC
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:03:07
Yea uh huh how many blocks ahve you ever mined in your life?
How many times have you ever made a transaction with BTC?
The answer for people like you is always 0. Same with the bitcoin core dev team. Dudes don't even own BTC
If segwit was so great LTC would be number 1. 
Lightining so we can chang BTC into shit coins and opne oursleves upt o regulation?
I'm a criminal and crypto user. I know what the appeal to crypto is.

Again you're a small child if you believe Ver bothers. 
Is some one using bots to do this? I would not doubt it. 
The guy worth probably well into 9 figures? LOL ok bud

@_date: 2017-11-14 21:23:25
Unless you're ready to retire. You're a liar. 
Maybe you're lying to yourself. But you're lying to some one 
How about a scenario where your miner wouldn't even pay it'self back? Running it at a loss into the foreseeable future? 
You still can't admit you'd switch? lol
Would it take exchanges switching BCC to the BTC ticker?

You understand the Asians don't see it this way at all. .. . Right?
They see BTC as some segwit crap coin that's gonna give up market share because lightning stupidly inflates the value of other coins (see vert pump, that i have a right to complain i was in on that pump)
We had a simple problem and the bitcoin core dev team figured since they're so good they should just try to make BTC shiny. When in reality a lot of people who bought BTC look at segwit and think "this opens us up to regulation and gives up marketshare by exchanging into other segwit coin for infinite scaling we don't need"
Pretty much sums up the argument
That sounds a lot worse than constantly having to increase block size which is very simple and conservative. Very little risk to our nest egg
So what if we have to increase node size? Bandwidth and memory prices go down all the time. . . .There is no reason the block size can't scale with that change. 
The alternative is lightning network, liquidity providers (which probably aren't legal without licensing most places so there goes the centralization argument). WHO ARE GOING TO FACILITATE SUCKING BTC'S MARKET SHARE OUT. 
And the fact you don't see the Asians who have more people in crypto already or will soon matter more than us pretty much says it all about your view. . .naive. We're English speakers we have great currencies beyond maybe the Rupee. GBP, USD, AUS, CAD all of them have very little incentive relative to a chinese or japanese national to get into BTC beyond an investment. 
Business will be done with coins outside places where they don't have the kings of fiat. 
That's where you get this whole equation wrong. Asia, Africa, Latin America 
BTC needs bigger blocks. Period 
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:16:32
Yup /the donald community members 
Pointing out logical fallacies since 2016. . . ?
The fee market is a terrible idea. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:31:15
No we don't
We need bigger blocks on BTC. . .. and will need bigger sooner or later on BCC. It's not that complex
There is no evidence that hemorrhaging market cap with something like lightning will be good for teh coin. 
It's a simpel fucking system. 
Businesses have a thousand avenues to move money, we want mass adoption. Especially 3rd world adoption
Fees have to be next to nothing on the chain for mass adoption. Period. 
Lightning isn't going to solve this for us anytime soon. Probably never will (lightning liquidity providers are going to need licenses from teh state or they're going to get censored. . . Who would want that as a side chain? What is wrong with you people? Why are you in crypto? You think you can just exchange coins in the US with no licenses? Are you people insane? Why would i want to involve myself in that?)

@_date: 2017-11-12 06:50:30
The same people control the hash in BTC and BCH
Segwit/lighting is a terrible overly aggressive idea that angers miners, is not consensus (as in a vast majority of stakeholders), and opens us up to regulation.
We got this far on teh white paper from nothing. ASICs are always going to be a problem on the number 1 coin. . . not even worth worrying about in this context. 
Pointless concerns that aren't solved by the current iteration of BTC anyway.

Yea so instead of investing in charity they dump money into "charity" hash for an asset that has made everyone an obscene amount of money voer the last year?
You're a child if you would do that.
Find some better shit to do with your time and money. Go to your local food shelter for fucks sake
Are people charitable? Sure. Do people buy mining hardware to be charitable? Not any significant amount of it. 
Slush came and defended the move saying it was just as profitable depending on what snapshot of time you take the ticker from and what exchange. Which is fair
Not a charity lol

No you wouldn't
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:42:54
Yea I totally acknowledge  fees + saving your cold storage coins value probably "made" all you guys more money than just mining BCC. 
not to mention the good press for the pool 
And you saved a lot of the market cap too for the rest of us (although i was ready to dump it all and you fucked up a good thing those of us who put our coins on exchanges had going hahaha)
 
I would argue without you mining the prices we would be comparing would be A LOT different. 0 blocks would have sent that price well below 5k and BTC would have looked like the pump and dump.

Even if you tripled it every few years it would add like 1k usd worth of memory to run a node over a decade. It's not a concern worth having. If you do the math even if we're increasing it all the time it's not a concern. . . .
Running a node already costs a few hundred dollars. Having it jump up to 1000 changes nothing. 
memory is so cheap, the cost is a terrible POW coin where no one knows if they can move their 6 THOUSAND DOLLAR A PIECE BTC is so unbelievably high. 
Or we could force peopel running nodes to buy more hard drives at very little cost to anyone. Less than a few hundred thousand in hardware for all the nodes in the world. 
Hmmm what should we do. ? lol wtf

you're giving up market share. . ..
Bitcoin core supporters are so ridiculous. . . Maybe try moving some crypto around before you try to talk in these issues. All the technical knowledge in the world won't help you if you don't understand how people use crypto. 
And you want these high fees so people running nodes need less storage in an age where the price of a gb of memory drops every day? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:46:42
You are a liar
You're not a charity
You would mine what is profitable even if you wanted more BTC. . . .

The fee market is a terrible fucking idea and will drive people away from BTC. Beyond stupid

Ivy league professors don't have idiots for nephews. . . Just not how the world works. General point was i could have that degree too if I wanted. Which should be pretty obvious considering the context. 
IDK why you think this is anything like "my dad is strong than your dad". You brought up IQ. I was just letting you know who you were talking too. 
I had a128 IQ on the only proctored test i've ever taken. . . So yea
