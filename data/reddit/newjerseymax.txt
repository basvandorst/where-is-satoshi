Turn off CNN and Fox and live happy life. If you want actual facts and not left or right then look for news on USA from another country.

It can happen to the best of us. I was transferring coin from exchange to wallet using copy and paste. Well once the “copy” didn’t copy and used wrong address.
Luckily I was easily able to import my transaction to correct coin. Having keys was essential to solving the problem. It was over 5k

Do you still believe in fundamentals of bitcoin or have you shifted to many other alt coins?

Never ever FEAR sell. At this point you might as well hold out. You have a chance at gains, if you sell now your a Guaranteed loser

A bitcoin bar where you can’t pay in bitcoin is pretty stupid IMO

I still think it’s oversold and above trend line. RSI looking like its trying to get healthy.
I put in a stop buy for $9800 and need to watch closely and raise it slightly.

I felt that squeeze at 13k bought. I felt squeeze at 11k and bought. I felt squeeze at 9k and bought more. If I feel the squeeze at 7k,5k,3k I don’t care I will buy more.
When it hits 50k that’s a lot of juice.
Did same with my favorite alts...

Honestly I took some profits off the table just today at $10900 after buying $6800 as my lowest. My first purchase was at 17k... I know, but kept buying as it was falling. And now I keep selling once I hit 30% profit on each purchas and will wait with USD on sidelines until next dip. I am still learning the charts and starting to see how much media plays into it.
