Why the Bitcoin Price "Drop" is Irrelevant.
Bitcoin is at $10,000? Oh No! Two months ago the community had the opposite reaction. Two MONTHS ago. The community has brainstormed a host of factors to explain this downturn. Was it the holiday money leaving the system that started all this? Or was it due to Bitcoin's valuation growing 400% in the four months prior?
Then came this Korean FUD that the government was banning cryptos. Then China made a similar statement. Then India. And now Tether seems to be the next FUD to "Pop the Bubble".
What happend after each FUD? The community became stronger. Korean citizens petitioned against their governments fake news. Now, six major South Korean banks are ready to link to the coin exchanges. In China, the crypto community has formed fundamental connections with the likes of NEO and VEN. Tether could create another drawdown. The community will find a solution and only grow stronger.
Price is addicting to follow, but at the core, bitcoin is about technology. Lightening Network makes bitcoin transaction speed insane and fees almost irrelevent. Segwit Wallets are increasingly accepted by exchanges. The Bitcoin transaction backlogs and fees has decreased. We have a lot to be excited about. This is about The Internet of Money. Stay strong community, we shall persevere.

@_date: 2018-01-23 16:43:39

@_date: 2017-12-16 11:44:25

@_date: 2018-09-01 13:47:35
Bitcoin is the international currency.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:40:59
add more btc to it so a transfer is worth the fee. hodl or spend. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:24:55
amen! in the name of the hodl father
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:44:33
youre doing it again.  you have your chance to buy now before pensions and endowments enter the market
@_date: 2018-09-01 13:57:35

seems wasteful to use gold as money when it actually has industrial uses 
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:39:15
fair enough...but what about near future..few years? surely you must know how it plays out far before all are mined since you consider noobs stupid for even asking about the limiting case?
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:28:32
what about a few years? or even after the halvening? do you see motivation to mine being sustainable? thats essentially the question that I see being asked
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:31:36
since its a "eli5 to a noob question" irrelevancy would still count as a good question...as that would be a type of question a n00b would ask....wouldnt u say? stupidity is not the same as ignorance
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:17:04
so..you are saying miners will continue to be motivated for long to come?
@_date: 2017-01-26 14:12:50
cool. i was just there in travel. could have helped!
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:04:43
good question
@_date: 2018-06-16 17:33:04
have the fine be payable only in btc
@_date: 2018-06-01 22:14:02
3.33x more expensive, or 333% higher.  
@_date: 2019-06-11 09:47:18
per year.    its 49m/yr.  but about 10b oz total of gold
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:19:26
 However, seeing an asset go up in price is not a good reason to buy.  Just as seeing a price decrease is not a good reason to sell. 
Dont forget!
@_date: 2019-12-15 19:44:13
I share this concern as well.  However, I dont understand how the tail wags the dog.  
I havent been able to figure out how.  Do you know?
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:25:18
thats a pretty penny 
@_date: 2019-12-15 19:51:37
Sure. Ok.  Makes sense.  The futures market must reach a certain size to dictate a significant aspect, say 50%, of the spot price.  Any idea when its a danger? Surely this is a current concern now for the btc spot price.

einsteins bday today
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:15:16
48? damn u old.
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:48:56
btc is money
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:04:55
Dont worry, your life probably didnt peak at 25, and even if you are living life as an old person, its probably far better than not living at all!
Just being alive is the real peak considering the context of the last 13.7B years.
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:25:21
good idea
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:23:13
Hehe. Im sorry.  I was trollin.  I tend to think 80+ is old.
