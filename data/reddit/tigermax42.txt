You are actually better off transferring the cash to coinbase pro and then buying the coin there due to lower fees. Also you can set orders rather than buying at market price.
It takes about a week for the money transfer

I had this problem sending from GDAX to ledger, so I sent it to my exodus wallet first, then to the ledger. Cost an extra $0.04 but now it’s safe at home

Double check if you have your 2FA code written down or saved somewhere. Or change your setting to SMS verification before you clear anything.
Honestly I wouldn’t trust iCloud to move it especially if you have a lot of funds on it. I recommend moving any assets off the exchange and/or logging into your account from another computer while you do the transfer. I’m no expert but I’ve heard coinbase customer service is terrible so you don’t wanna risk your money waiting for them to figure shit out

Could be your 2FA code

You make a coinbase account then free transfer to coinbase pro. Takes a week to load the account. Then you only pay 0.05% fee

Considering how well Dash has been received in Venezuela, I think it will be accepted as currency for a while to come. But still no comparison to big daddy BTC

No problems here. I think the treasury Gestapo lowered the reportable limit from 10k to 5k

TD bank is based in Canada, the teller there tipped me off before Litecoin’s moonshot (cashed out at 300) and also gave me a Binance referral. F yeah!

Get a friend or relative to just make an account, then transfer purchases to your wallet

Bank transfer takes a week with them. I usually just transfer some money over every week before I even know what I wanna buy
