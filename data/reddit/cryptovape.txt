Bits is fairly future proof, we're all hoping/expecting things won't cost so many bits as the value goes up!
@_date: 2015-06-23 20:03:37
Also, we can add the inflation of gold itself through mining and, more importantly, the creation of paper gold.

Nice.  Would like to see those internet speed, hard drive storage, and BTC adoption rate graphs.

Just need a way to prevent gaming incentivized nodes.
@_date: 2015-06-05 13:47:56
Invite them to participate by downloading a wallet and then send some to each participant.  Then they can send them or sell them to each other afterwards. That should capture their attention!

It's called block withhodling.  Selfish mining is when you save your found block and release it once someone else finds it, giving yourself a head start to build on your own block. It's what makes you able to find all blocks with over 50% (more or less) hash power. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 01:55:35
@_date: 2014-07-28 21:08:44
Excellent point. And he could just wait for darkwallet to spend the coins, not to sell them, which is counterproductive to the project. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 19:15:10
Yeah I think people finally realized they were giving their money away.  Srsly tho all things bubble, it's part of human nature, maybe the next changetip bubble will be tipping on news articles on ad free sites.

If there was a side chain for microtransactions, tipping for example, wouldn't the coins created on the side chain essentially inflate the supply of BTC?

the concern involves how larger block sizes will affect mining pools, especially p2pool.  it requires you to have more bandwidth to transmit the block first.

I've heard of smart heating elements in homes. I like that idea because it's so decentralized, and economical.
@_date: 2014-11-28 05:49:37
Nice thoughts. With bitcoin as a global currency, people will hold bitcoin, causing its value to go up.  This will throttle the economy as less money is invested in businesses, which will cause the value of bitcoin to stop going up. This causes people to invest in businesses in order to see some return, which increases the value of bitcoin. The currency value reflects the value of the economy. So, the current algorithm self regulates.  Deflation isn't a problem because people will always buy living essentials.  It just gives them an incentive to save.

"Terrorism, money laundering", looks like bad news. So... Buy?
@_date: 2014-06-13 10:54:56
And by choosing what transactions to process, can't they control the fees?
@_date: 2014-07-25 17:25:26
Banks can afford to offer interest because they can safely invest in things with greater growth than the fiat currency.  Right now you can't safely beat bitcoins growth, so interest doesn't work.
Furthermore, in a world with only bitcoin (and mining period over) bitcoin value goes up on par with the value of the whole economy. So to offer interest you'd have to "beat the market". Essentially bitcoin has invisible interest built in, no bank necessary.

It's the size of the trade. 1e-8 is [scientific notation]( for 1 x 10^-8 which is equal to .00000001 which would be 1 satoshi

Very cool. With bitpay they have the option to keep a % as bitcoin, and probably can cap that at your paycheck level.  Worth talking to them about!

Often they reply "Yeah we take everything, if it swipes, we take it" :P I've grown to love asking.  I just drop the question and at the very least it's good for some laughs.  Just like you and me, these people need to be "touched" by the idea a few times before they'll look into it. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 17:09:06
And if you want to keep a backup, fine, just in case they lose it or throw it away you can give it back to them at a later date.  That would really impress them!

@_date: 2014-12-05 21:21:53
How about after?
@_date: 2014-12-12 21:45:17
Nice explanation.  To build on that, it's going to keep going up even after everyone uses it because no inflation. Just like computers, phones, and iPads go down in price, everything will do that.  Everything advances, electronics is faster. Advances = price drop.

Welcome to BTC young gentleman!  At this point, instead of mining, I would just buy bitcoin with $ you can afford to lose.  Buy over time, some from each paycheck to minimize volatility risk.
Edit: circle.com and coinbase.com are good for buying with a bank account, but there are other ways to buy with cash
@_date: 2014-06-14 22:18:29
People spend dollars quickly and with credit because there's no gain for hodling.  Deflationary currency gives reason to save and not need credit.

Right now 3,000 bits are 1 US$, So the bit is 3x stronger than the rupiah.

At $10,000/BTC, 100 bits = $1

At $1,000,000/BTC, 1 bit = $1

But if it's smooth, it's a sure-win bet, and thus many get in (Bubble). Then price flattens, some get out, and then more get out as it drops.  Regular markets bubble constantly. Bitcoin just grows faster because it's new tech like TV and microwave.

I don't think 1-2 million BTC were purchasable...  I heard about it at $5 but got in much later. That's why I got in later: If I first heard about it now I wouldn't be in now, so we're blessed to be in now.  Sure, many have heard about BTC, but few get it.
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:38:44
Yes, BTCing is believing!
@_date: 2015-01-29 03:38:00
I believe credit with bitcoin will actually have risk, as credit is supposed to. Lending coins puts you at risk of not getting paid back, and no one can create coins for you if you don't.

They advertised their messages. Bitcoin is a decentralized project, so we the members of the community do the promotions. The difference is it's less social engineering than commercials and more giving others the idea and letting them decide if they like the project.
@_date: 2017-02-21 03:16:51
i think you're getting mad because i'm making sense.
but you actually made my point:


right now, the miners are restricting access to the blockchain by mining small one mb blocks.  this is a current real problem, unlike the hypothetical one you're focused on.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:29:58
yes... other proposals are just noise.

I see you have a BTC address on your site, nice.  I also recommend searching alternative treatments, as they are not nearly as costly.  Sending you wishes and prayers.

Bitquick.co seems the best option, as you just deposit cash at a bank without having to meet any strangers.

It's so simple that if people hoard money, they will have more money!  That's the real economic stimulus.  The people having more money! 
@_date: 2015-04-01 15:49:08
Why is an altcoin necessary to store documents on the bitcoin blockchain?
@_date: 2015-03-10 14:41:59
Can't wait to hear the metaphor :)
@_date: 2015-03-26 03:17:40
Very cool.  Now if there's a master public key setting for the seller, it could remove the 'enter payment address' step.  
@_date: 2015-03-17 02:11:13
You're right.  I suppose in bitcoinworld banks will give loans denominated in BTC with lower interest rate (but similar real interest rate).  But the bank's risk will be real.  Regulate yourselves and Wells see how FarUgo.

The fact is no one knows.  It's common thought that  BTC's success will come with great opposition. Also we don't know who controls Mt. Gox coins.  
That being said, I have confidence bitcoin will overcome any opposition.
@_date: 2015-03-12 15:21:50
And the whole credit system can be gone when bitcoin replaces debt currency with asset currency.

@_date: 2015-03-11 20:34:38
Cool utility!  So maybe if the address were shortened (like casascius coins) it could be encoded to a short memorable phrase.
@_date: 2015-03-26 02:27:58
That's great. So it seems the seller has already signed the tranaction to release funds to himself before the buyer has.  
@_date: 2015-03-18 17:33:01
Now that just sounds nice!
@_date: 2015-03-17 01:52:39
Hmm interesting thought, has anyone thought about doing that to BTC?
@_date: 2015-03-11 21:14:47
Over the phone seems like a definite use case. Would you consider making a BIP39 version or would it require too many words?
