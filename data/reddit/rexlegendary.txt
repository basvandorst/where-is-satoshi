Anything that can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. Maybe you're the one who is bad at logic.

It's a win-win for me. Either he pays me or his reputation is trashed. The worst that can happen is OP is somehow right and I have to get a lawyer to tell him I'm not paying him.

I can post a reddit thread for you, but I must warn you that my fee for that is 251 bitcoins.

Hey I'll take the bet. Specifically, I bet that you *will not be able to prove* that you own a profitable solar miner in the desert, as you have described. **I** don't need to do anything, right? Just post pictures (as well as receipts and proof of your identity), and if this subreddit is generally convinced that the evidence isn't forged, I'll send the 250btc to an account of your choice (I don't have 250 btc but I have the cash to go buy it). Make sure the pictures show the greenhouse from multiple angles. I may ask for further evidence if yours is inaccurate.
If you can't or won't post the evidence, then I claim victory. You can send the 250btc to International Childcare Fund (ICCF) Holland: **13UUaGK8ZDLxjY7RYu2bKEabqjww2KDyxD**
Since you said 2 hours ago and 4 hours ago that you were going to post pictures. I'll give you two more hours for proof and 24 after that for payment.
edit: I can afford around 400 btc so I have no complaints if you want to raise the payoff even more

Probably the escrow service itself. I took his bet and he demanded that I post a new thread about it. The current thread was on So, I dunno, looks like he wanted me to advertise for him?
Why do **you** think he doesn't just post proof of his setup whenever someone asks for proof? Do you think it adds to his credibility? Do you think it is very likely that a bilingual physician with a math degree can make profitable solar bitcoin greenhouses but can't use his phone to take believable photos? Is that more likely to you than the guy being dishonest?
edit: tldr think critically dude
