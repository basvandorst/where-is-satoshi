If you did the middle stone as the BTC logo with the links attached to that... that would be insane!! Strong work though, I like it.

The plan is that it will be worth Xamount in the future and be spendable as is. Not needing to cash out.  If I can buy a house, car, payoff school loans, etc., with BTC why would i need to cash out.

The reason for the drop just now is because I just bought more /s wtf!

Do you do them on a small scale? Where can they be purchased? D you sign and number each piece?

Shhh, don't bother him. He is trying to buy some right now!

or.... don't sell and just eventually buy and pay for whatever you need with bitcoin when it is worth 10 mil a coin..
Unles you are older.. say 60+

Just sold some of my shitcoins for more BTC. Feels good.

And I was nervous when I bought $200 worth at 10K, Now I feel so smart!  Usually, every time I would buy in the past it immediately went down...remember those days.

cover it in plastic (water damage)
If you are worried about fire, buy a fireproof safe they are pretty inexpensive.

I always wonder if I would have bought at that point in time or if I would have just thought it was a stupid idea.
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:36:39
Maybe do it increments. I wouldn't sell it all at once, especially with it continuing to rise.

Go for it!  There is no sign of this thing stopping!  If you haven't watched it yet... watch the video on youtube called "10 million dollar bitcoin" and then tell everyone else you meet to watch it too.  It helps with the headache of trying to explain BTC to anyone.

YouTube: "10 million dollar bitcoin", it's about 45 min long.  you'll end up buying more when you finish watching it.

don't touch it!
If you think that way you will be pulling your hair out.  just put money aside every pay and try to buy when you see the big red dildos in the charts. and then forget about it. I assume you too believes that this will someday be worth more than at least 100K a BTC and at that point right now won't matter.

Why didn't I just buy 2BTC when it was at 3k!! Damn hindsight! its so crystal clear now
