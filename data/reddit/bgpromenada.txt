yep keep Bitcoin for 2 years and you are done.
@_date: 2019-10-30 01:47:49
Reason for this is they all moved out! Normal people are buying in east Palo Alto. 
That neighborhood is not what it use to be! Now is "Fancy"
@_date: 2019-10-20 22:19:41


I think the same. Its going up very soon
@_date: 2019-10-21 21:35:06
Depends on a market. Now maybe not but if market goes up 20-30% then price for then will increase too! Also depends on your electricity rate.
@_date: 2019-10-24 03:37:53
BTC will be around with Lightning network even more support
@_date: 2019-10-20 20:40:39
Hey very simple. Contact TokenTrade. They can do this for you. Whole invoicing thing. Also they have QB integration.
I did it with them. Very low fees.

Yes but in that case dollar compared to other assets would worth nothing.
You can also cash out all your Bitcoins but compared to other assets can be much less than what it use to be. 
So if we all start selling USD for some other assets USD would go to 0 meaning you won't be able to buy any satoshi.

100-200 AUD? Its not like you are risking a lot.
I think I would rather ask myself do I want to miss out opportunity to make 10x-20x on BTC in next 2 years.

I am just asking if is grammatically correct :D
@_date: 2019-10-20 21:13:50
@_date: 2019-10-28 03:17:43
yeah maybe but still it would be nice though owning 10 BTC.
@_date: 2019-10-20 19:46:41
LOOOOL 
No wonder BTC is going up. Why would you hold your assets in something that get printed like there is no tomorrow. 
@_date: 2019-10-20 21:12:38
Land is limited. 
To build apartments and houses you have room to grow like 1M x of current supply so for me that is limited. 
The thing is, oil will really never end. The reason is that from 30% up to 70% of oil in an oil well just remains there — buried underground.
In order to retrieve it you need to expend a lot of money by either using advanced recovery techniques such as polymer-treated injection fluids or even by injecting LPG into the oil well so you can make sure most of the oil actually gets out instead of just clinging to the reservoir rocks.

some people do
@_date: 2019-10-24 03:34:20
The only thing that sucks is that bull is about to come. Next bull will be like 100-200k and you will remember what you had. That will be real pain for you. I ak sorry bro.
@_date: 2019-10-21 05:07:49
Great comment! :)
@_date: 2019-10-21 07:34:55
Hey any of those wallets is decentralized ?
@_date: 2019-10-21 04:19:22
I would buy it if building is hermetically sealed!
@_date: 2019-10-20 23:25:24
Just as proof that TA is not always right! 
I think we are on the verge to spike ATH.
@_date: 2019-10-21 03:13:55
I wish he is. Then we know that master wallet is lost for good :)
@_date: 2019-10-24 04:48:18
I would do 80% bitcoin and then others
@_date: 2019-10-23 00:44:57
Are you sure that it was edited?
@_date: 2019-10-29 04:48:21
and that is perfectly fine. 20k and more you need to report. Dude you have to report 10k in Bank account in another country too.
@_date: 2019-10-20 05:48:15
Shouldn't node be faster? Like super fast fiber optic. 10-20 ms ping to certain server etc?
@_date: 2019-10-24 03:29:49
yes Bull is coming!
@_date: 2019-10-24 03:28:52
first thing stock and housing dump
@_date: 2019-10-24 04:04:30
If you want long term and you have above 1 BTC do it on a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-24 01:25:21
Nah Death Cross has been crossed. Bring it on. Time to load more BTC.
@_date: 2019-10-21 03:51:37
Ok then one big is centralized exchange issue. You really need to trust CoinBase to store anything there. 
This is why more people are enabled about hardware wallets.
@_date: 2019-10-24 01:30:21
There is no 'lower break-even costs'. Its all fake. 
People promote 0.035c but in reality its 0.07c POWER COST ONLY. 
Its bunch of BS. Power world wide cost is 0.07c. THis is WHOLESALE power on the open market. 
50 euro per MWH.  (about 0.06c USD). 
This is without transit (power line lease). 
So all those commercials about 5-6-7c per kwh are big BS or scammers.
@_date: 2019-10-28 04:44:38
What do you mean by "Backpage" ?
@_date: 2019-10-24 02:34:16
Don't worry I will screenshare once It drops more!
Because I am a buyer thats why. You always have buyers and sellers. Someone wants in someone wants out. Very simple. I am bullish because I am buying soon.
@_date: 2019-10-24 01:23:22


ANYTHING "E" Basically. Probably even airplane, stock market everything would need to collapse first
@_date: 2019-10-21 02:15:35
not produced but mined. Problem with that is we don't know where is the end of new gold coming out from mines.
@_date: 2019-10-21 07:26:30
All right. I will try some of those. :) 
@_date: 2019-10-24 05:55:35
Because it would be crazy. Price is about to go up big time. Bull is coming.
@_date: 2019-10-20 23:36:14
@_date: 2019-10-20 20:00:01
The same for USD
@_date: 2019-10-21 21:34:01
If I ever build ATM it will be like 1% fee.
@_date: 2019-10-21 04:08:09
Land is only finite. Because high rises can go 500000feet high! Practically speaking unlimited
@_date: 2019-10-20 20:53:47
Just check Unlimited QE. All those little instability in certain regions is nothing compared what is coming.
@_date: 2019-10-24 01:25:43
@_date: 2019-10-28 02:19:26
It will adjust like always. Before next halving BTC price will be 20-25k at least.
@_date: 2019-10-21 03:40:38
There are many possible reasons. 
person dies, goes to mental disability state, lose email, phone, they ban his country, hack, forgot about coins...
I am wondering why there are no more 'lost' coins than current estimate.
@_date: 2019-10-24 03:38:05
This time gone for good
@_date: 2019-10-20 21:13:29
I don't understand.  With pre-deposited $$ on Coinbase you can do it very fast.
@_date: 2019-12-09 19:50:36
it will increase a year or two after halving
