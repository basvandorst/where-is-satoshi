Hey man, its pretty cool that you're making that proposal, just out of curiosity, how are you addressing the security issues of bitcoin and the fact that they can be stolen?
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:13:08
Yes I got a mycelium wallet.
Edit: just realized I had blockchain on my wallet as well and it has qr code. Gonna use that instead

Find it hard to believe that people who are savvy enough to invest in bitcoin are willing to waste their money on buying porn.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:41:36
because its exciting to see how it does. The recent spike is due to China mainly and right now its volatility can be attributed to the hearing.
@_date: 2013-11-10 17:51:59
probably gonna tip it forward to spread the word, thanks man.
