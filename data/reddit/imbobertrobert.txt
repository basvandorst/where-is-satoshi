Clearly you don't understand the 'equality' of how the government works.

And remember that if some guy runs off with a bunch of shots, you'll feel a lot less drunk, and those around you might feel a lot more angry.

How can I find the transaction ID? If you mean the one on the blockchain, I can't, because according to the blockchain the transaction doesn't exist.

Thank you so much for linking me that, I feel kinda stupid that I didn't look for the FAQ for multibit -.-
Restarting it didn't work, and resetting is taking a while, so I'll post later if it fixed it.

That's what I'm trying right now, and it's almost done (80%). 
I have been thinking about trying a few newer coins instead of just Scrypt alts, but I haven't tried Electrum yet.

EDIT: see my edit above, nothing in the wallet can be spent. I don't know if this has anything to do with it.

Hey, I have that same PSU! I love it, since the fan isn't always on.

This Bitcoin Vs. Dogecoin shit is really getting pathetic on both sides. A few random Dogecoin-goers spam this subbreddit, and then you guys complain without doing anything about it.
Yes, they don't have any reason to be saying these things, and really, it's just rude, but don't shun all of them just because a few of them ruin it for the rest.

Oh you precious, precious thing.
