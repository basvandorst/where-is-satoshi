Interesting. Thank you, at least I can see how the number is created.
If only 40 cards of a full deck are taken into account then we get only 196 bits of entropy, am I right? Does it matter for the security of the wallet? I've heard that more than 160 bits of entropy have the same security as 160 bits.

Thanks for the suggestion.
I would like to use cards but how can I make sure that the generated raw binary is random when using cards as a source of entropy? With dice I can compare the results to other sites, but iancoleman's site is the only one that offers card entropy.
I understand that each card has a number from 0-51, I verified that via binary-&gt;base10 conversion. But let's say we've got two cards Jd (23) and and 5c (4), then the binary converts to 1176 in base10. How is it done?

You are on the right path. But it could also be generating easy to guess (for the creator) private key through a well hidden bug. That's why it would be necessary to enter the dice throws into multiple separate generators to verify that you get the same private key, not just address.

I think something is wrong with the card to number conversion. 
I used a randomly shuffled deck:
    5c6sac2s8c5h8sjcqs2htc8hqd9c3s2c7hts4sqcah3c6d7s8djdkh
    3has9dkd5d4d7cadksjs9h7d5s2d4c9sqh6c3d4htd6hthkcjh
and got a raw binary:    000110110011100111001000100010101001000111011101011110111100010111010010001010011000111101101010100110010010101110111111110101010010100110011110111000000101100111110100111100000001010101100110000110010011011010000101110100101
which I converted to base6:
    40432321313504115003044242402202220244020444040024044424404040002040422224222244424240
And visually noticed that  it's mainly 2-4-0 .
The results (number - occurances):
   0-22,  1-4,  2-24,  3-5 , 4-29,  5-2
Results of your provided deck were similar, 1-3-5 appeared ~3 times while 0-2-4 appeared ~25 times. I think the entropy is much lower than 225 bits for a full deck.
edit: sorry about formatting. I added 4 spaces before the lines but they're not formatted as code for some reason.
