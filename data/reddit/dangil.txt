so this is why prices are down?

the transaction velocity of bitcoin is something subjective
on a clean network, with no pending transactions, one transaction will take about 10 minutes for the first confirmation
to be safe, usually people wait for a few confirmations to make sure the transaction is fine, so you wait about an hour
but every 10 minute block only has space for 1M (or 4M segwith) bytes of transactions. so every node arrange the queued transactions from the mempool and make them valid in a mined block
today we have about 100Mbytes of transactions on the mempool.. every 10 minutes we can reduce 1M(or 4M in segwit) of that pool... but new transactions keep incomming
to help your transaction be picked by nodes to be included in a mined block, you can give more fee... this leads to an open market, and that leads to high transaction fees
if you are not in a hurry, a lower fee will do the job
the main issue here is that the fee is a fixed amount, based on the size in bytes of your transaction, and not on the amount of btc transfered. so a low value transaction could have a high value fee depending on the size of the transaction. 
how many inputs and outputs the transaction has influences the size in bytes.

the hard part is getting the hash right... you have to keep trying until it hits the right number of zeroes, based on difficulty.. it's a probabilistic result. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:30:13
In a way yes. The hash guarantees that nothing in that block will change, and since the last block’s hash is part of the data, it makes the chain sound
But what really “authenticates” is the proof of work. The longest chain. The chain that had more cpu power.

The money is not in the wallet. It's in the blockchain. 
The wallet only saves private keys. 
@_date: 2014-11-28 20:04:58
At what difficulty it's easier to bruteforce the private key than to mine?
@_date: 2014-07-14 14:33:10
How electrum or other similar wallets determine your wallet balance without the full blockchain download?
@_date: 2014-03-29 22:08:11
Can you use those to brute force sha256 hashed passwords with a software update?
@_date: 2014-02-08 21:02:58


and it's not even optimized
@_date: 2014-07-14 18:36:31
How can we be sure electrum is safe and doesn't send our private keys to their servers? Also, why imported keys are less safe then generated ones ?

Bank and money are two different things. Bitcoin isn't a bank.

... The odds...

so much rez

That’s why you hodl btc and bch until the end

It's not the money in itself that is flawed. The flaw is that the government creates inflation by printing money to pay its own debt. 
If a government eventually adopts bitcoin as an tax payment currency, then it would change the game. 
If it remains a parallel currency with large enough adoption, than it might be a good investment. But not a game changer.

so now's the time for bitcoin rain to repay what was stolen
@_date: 2015-04-10 21:35:04
That doesn't mean btc price will be $10,000 real soon now. 
@_date: 2015-03-29 04:16:56
Stupid news headlines. 48% of what? 1 in a million to 1.48 in a million? 
@_date: 2015-02-07 16:50:12
Banks could attribute any value to bitcoin fractions when doing trusted transactions between them. For example, they could agree that 0.001 BTC equals to 1 million dolars. This wouldn't affect BTC mainstream price. So the whole size of economy divided by number of bitcoins math to predict its future price is bogus in my opinion. 
@_date: 2019-05-13 03:23:04
it was a simple 1000BTC transfer... the other 47000 was transfered to a second wallet by the same guy... simple hierarchical deterministic wallet
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:46:20
I can say that I sold lots of bitcoins there, and they sent me the fiat quickly
