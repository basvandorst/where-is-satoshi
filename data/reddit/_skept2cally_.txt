Gavin Andresen ‏  3h
I'm disappointed Newsweek decided to dox the Nakamoto family, and regret talking to Leah.

You are correct. But as far as the courts are concerned, bitcoins aren't assets or liabilities since mt.gox didn't list it. It isn't up for consideration.
Also, I wonder since mtgox didn't sell any goods or merchandise, is it liable to its customers? People are selling to and from each other, not with mt.gox. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:58:44

What did you use if not mtgox in 2011 you worthless fucking shill?

I'm not cherry picking anything. I'm just stating a lie he told.


He lied. 


 
And I provided proof that refuted the assertion that dorian barely speaks english.


Well if he is using a LIE to prove a case...


I'm not even concerned about the overall point. I'm just STATING A FUCKING TRUTH. If you demand integrity and truth from leah goodman, then hold yourself to the same fucking standard. 


No. It's a lie. Stop trying to sugarcoat it. You fuckers are no better than the journalists you malign.


And stop making excuses. 


Oh stfu you worthless shill. If it was leah goodman who made an OBVIOUS mistake to advance her agenda, you'd be all over that. And rightfully so. 
Same standards should be applied to both idiot journalists with selfish-intentions and retarded jew bitcoin shills with greedy-intentions.
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:30:03
Well at least we can put the "he can't speak english" nonsense to rest now.

You stated in the interview that dorian satoshi can barely speak english...
You cleared lied.
Edit: I don't know who is or who is not satoshi nakamoto, but it seems like the bitcoin fanatics are just as interested in spreading lies as leah goodman.

No you wrote "The whole point of Bitcoin is that it is a trustless system!". 


The fact that it was one of the largest and oldest exchanges?


What a fucking idiot. What's your point? Using your logic, we can't do anything with bitcoin. If you order something with bitcoins and the vendor doesn't send you the protect. It's YOUR fault right. Dumb fucking shit. So if you try to trade on coinbase and coinbase just takes your money, it's your point. Also, you don't understand what "trustless" means you dumb fuck. Also, you do not understand the meaning of "bitcoin is a trustless system". It has more to do with lack of centralized control rather than not being able to trust people. Dumb shit parroting words you just heard.


It wasn't just random people you dumb cockroach. So stop with your nonsense. And ONCE AGAIN, using your logic, bitcoin is useless. How would you ever trade bitcoins you dumb cockroach. 


My father and I don't have the close relationship as you do with yours. 


Hey keep peddling them bitcoin you worthless useless cockroach.

The more this guy talks, the more suspicious I am that he is satoshi.


His english isn't flawless? What does this even mean? The guy's been in the US since he was 10 years old. He attended university, got a physics degree, been married to two american women, etc. His english is fluent or flawless as anyone else's. 


Now I'm really suspicious. So he admits denying something. But he denies he's no longer in "engineering"?


Bitcom? Now it seems like he's deliberately trying to sound stupid. 


Sounds "flawless" to me...
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:50:19
This gets to the frontpage? Honestly, how fucking insanely insensitive and greedy are you fucking degenerate shills? 
So if someone' family got killed, you'd post "Today my family wasn't killed..." If someone got cancer "Today, I didn't get cancer..."
Instead of letting people who lost their bitcoins THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN be, you try to marginalize them to protect your bitcoin investment? 
Honestly, parasites are worse than wall street. Honestly, someone lost bitcoins on mt.gox should hunt you down and make your bitcoins disappear.
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:01:25


That's not how VCs work you dumb moron. Most VC ventures fail. If you don't know what you are talking about, shut your trap fucking shill.


In what way exactly? They don't expose anything. No volume data, no transaction data, no order book, nothing.
@_date: 2014-03-05 15:25:59


What was their fault?


Except that it was vouched for by a lot of people. 


How do you know? Does it mean that they deserve to have bitcoins stolen from them? What kind of idiotic logic is that you fucking bloodsucking reject? There is difference between RISKING and LOSING due to bitcoin price drop AND HAVING IT FUCKING STOLEN. You parasitic greedy dimwit.


That's like saying if a woman dresses slutty, she deserves to be raped. Or if you didn't lock your door, you deserve to be robbed. Are you fucking retarded?


What a fucking greedy filth you are. So if someone robs your house while you are away, then it was your fault right? 
Good. Hopefully people are hunting for you right now.

@_date: 2014-03-07 22:27:57


I presented you with video evidence of him speaking english. You have to be an exceptional retard to cling to your position. The smart thing to do is just admit you made a mistake and move on. 


This shows that he doesn't understand what bitcoin is. Not whether he can or cannot speak english.


He barely speaks english and yet you were able to pick up on what he said. Strange. What language was dorian and the reporter speaking? Certainly not hebrew...

You are the epitome of the know-nothing shill.


You don't understand the difference between equity trading and currency trading. Compare likes with likes moron.


You are too stupid to realize that is not a good deal. Most online brokers charge a fixed fee for trading equities. For example, I pay $2.95 whether I want to buy $100K in AAPL or $1000 in aapl. The reason I haven't bought any bitcoin is because the fee structure for buying/selling bitcoins is RIDICULOUS. 


Yes. If a "hacker" steal from my online broker, I don't lose my money. If the owners of the brokers decided to steal customers' funds and declare bankruptcy, I don't lose a dime. 


Are you retarded? You don't enjoy any level of protection. Ask a mt.gox customer. I can't be "scammed" or "robbed" of my online trading account.


I'm done wasting my time with retarded shills like you. EIther you are exceedingly stupid and ignorant or you are the slimiest shill on earth. Fuckers like you should be removed from the gene pool either way.

The government created the internet.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:47:59
It shows that the amount of money transacted is diminishing greatly. It means less and less people are buying bitcoins.
You can have ten transactions each worth $100 for a total dollar volume of $1000. Or you can have a million transactions each at $.000001 for a total dollar volume of $1. 
Also, the number of transactions are greatly skewed due to shady "bot" trades of insignificant amounts of bitcoins to give the illusion of price stability.

No you haven't. You are a fucking liar. 
Edit: What the fuck is the point of arguing when YOU CAN SEE THAT HE CAN SPEAK ENGLISH FLUENTLY. It's like seeing that the earth is not flat and yet continuing to argue it is. Are you this fucking retarded?
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:44:57


Yes moron. The problem is PROVING it. It's mighty difficult to prove someone stole your bitcoins. 
Who is going to jail for stealing bitcoins in the mt.gox case? That's right, no one. Dumb fucking cockroach.


Did I say otherwise retard?

You are confusing bitcoin with mtgox. Mtgox is an exchange not a cryptocurrency. Stop with your nonsense. Bitcoin didn't steal from people. Mt.gox did. 


Random website? The CEO was a director of Bitcoin Foundation. It was the oldest and most widely used exchange on earth for most. It was vouched for by bitcoin "insiders".
Can you fucking retarded trash stop with the nonsense. I know is a boiler room run by greedy rats but this is getting ridiculous.

Yes. That's what mt.gox users did... Don't breed. You are too fucking stupid to exist, let alone procreate.


No moron. I didn't say you supported raping women. I said you are blaming the rape victim for getting raped. Learn to read and think. You are blaming the victim. 


Yes and there are horror stories for every exchange. Google it. So using your logic, we shouldn't use any exchange. But I bet if we read your comment history, you pumped exchanges before. I wouldn't be surprised if you pumped mt.gox in the past either. There are horror stories of people who's computer got hacked and they lost their bitcoins. There are all kinds of horror stories.
But you can also google gox support stories you worthless shill.
Not to mention that the ceo of mt.gox was a director of the BITCOIN FOUNDATION  YOU WORTHLESS FUCKING SHILL. 


So the insiders of bitcoin are crack addicts looking to steal your money? Okay shill...


So handing over your "wallet" to the largest bitcoin exchange is handing it over to crack addict. 
Just fucking stop already you deranged fucking filth. It's like debating a fundamental christian. A cultish logic from pure fucking greed.
Like I said, hopefully the hunt for you has begun and some mt.gox victims can be made whole...
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:58:27


Firstly, a customer isn't a debtor. So mtgox damaging their customer's "property" isn't damaging the debtor's property. Secondly, mt.gox did not list bitcoins as an asset, property or anything. So to the bankruptcy court, bitcoins are worthless, do not exist, do not matter.

"Gavin Andresen is the chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation"
Gavin is one of the few people who actually knows who "satoshi nakamoto" is. He pretty much confirmed the story is true.
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:55:04


If he meant "a nakamoto family", why didn't he write "a nakamoto family" instead of "THE nakamoto family".
Also, gavin could've tweeted, "that's not the real satoshi". Why did he say he regret talking to leah.
There is no smoking gun, but there is a compelling case that it is satoshi...
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:41:16


Can't. Never owned any bitcoins and most likely, never will.


Forgive me for seeing through your bullshit pump and dump. 
You should post to @_date: 2014-03-06 18:15:55
Holy shit, what fucking deranged batshit insane drivel. This is like the reaction you get from a cult member who has his "faith" tested. You are foaming at the mouth kid.
Who cares if he is the creator or not? Did you have a mythical image of satoshi that is being shattered at this very moment? It's the protocol that's important. Not the inventor. And even if he is not the real satoshi, the real satoshi is bound to be more in line with newsweek's satoshi than your fantasy.
Although newsweek hasn't provided proof, they have laid out a compelling case. Of course they have ulterior motives- generating attention to their relaunch of their print edition, but they laid out their case.
Also, the fact that gavin andressen hasn't rejected the story outright leads me to believe it is true.

You are terribly mistaken. Mt.Gox did not list bitcoins as an asset. You can't use a non-asset to pay off anything. 
Bankruptcy courts look at your assets and liabilities. They decide how much of the assets goes to the creditors and how much of the liabilities to forgive. If bitcoins are not assets ( according to mt.gox filing ), then it can't be used to offset liabilities...

In his scenario, his japanese skills would deteriorate, not his english skills. He's been living in the US for 54 years. Not in japan. If you moved to japan, married a japanese woman and lived there for 54 years, it's your english proficiency that would suffer, not your japanese.

It's all starting to look like an act. Who knows...
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:20:07


Unless they admit to stealing bitcoin, there is no way to prove theft. It's unregulated so there are no legal requirements to keep an audit trail, transaction trail or to even track your customers' data. 
That's why karpeles isn't facing a criminal probe like madoff. Karpeles could just say they were hacked and it's his word against no one's.
