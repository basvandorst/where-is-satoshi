Check out CoinDesk's "State of Bitcoin" report. This one is for Q1 2014, but there is also one for the entire year of 2013 when they started doing them in December.

I'll check back in a bit, tried that number and their website number to no avail. Hope they're around

Look up their multisig accounts. They offer the ability to require both your private key AND theirs in order to make a transaction. And their private key is actually your phone, pin and palm scan. More info:

I thought BitAccess ATMs were not KYC compliant?

Yeah, it is true. I guess I hold more trust in them as opposed to Chase or Bank of America. I've actually met their entire team in Las Vegas and they seem like really down to earth guys. I trust my gut with them.
Although it may not work for you, there's millions around the world that it does work for. Those people will perpetuate the growth of this company.
ATMs are a necessary technology during the age of transition between fiat and digital currency. And that age, my friend can last decades.

Decentralization of education is equally as important as direct voting. They go hand in hand.

No, although I would like to omit names for their privacy. We'll be talking about implementing Bitcoin initiatives in the city of Syracuse. Obviously, the proposed Bitlicense puts a damper on the parade, but everything is up for discussion.

Yeah... That's true. Google and their website said they're open daily until 10pm.

Looks great! What font is this?

I agree. Especially about those private/public keys getting easier to manage :) it would be great if Bitcoin was all ruling but simple facts like we can't pay our taxes in Bitcoin make a transition service from fiat to digital REQUIRED.
To me, this is the best way to go about said exchange service.

You think he would come out for this?
@_date: 2014-08-14 20:53:43
Those are some great points, I've written them down and will include them. Thanks so much for your input :)

Update: ran into a friend on the street (so random) that knew the owners and had their number. Meeting up with them tomorrow. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 22:13:21
Couldn't hurt to try. Also messaged their fb page. He contacted me :)
@_date: 2014-05-03 03:07:03
Oh well, thanks anyway!

Sure thing! More private schools with a more diverse course menu. More specializations and less generalizations. Nowadays we have a "1 system fits all" for school children. Less subsidies for public, general schools and more subsidies for private, specialized schools.
This could mean more homeschooling. This could mean more freedom in what the child can study or maybe less freedom. We just need more diversification because when we try to control what is learned, the ones that learn a different way are chewed up and spit out.
I hope that answers the question.

I ordered 1000+ but never received a reply via email. Can I still assume they are coming?
