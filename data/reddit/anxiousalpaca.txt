This may be an effect of the dip (stop loss?), not the cause.

people who use them know what they are, specific patterns of 0s and 1s.


by that standard the whole society would not be durable, as it would collapse if the internet and all computers shut down.
@_date: 2012-03-15 14:10:18
Whoops yeah of course.

The only way this could be biased is the believe in property and that one that one owns their own body and their product of labor.   
If one rejects property of course it's not gonna make sense and throwaway-o's explanation is biased.
@_date: 2012-09-30 14:23:03
Well that's true, but you are not at fault for that.
@_date: 2012-03-15 12:54:17
Can you use the 10^x notation?
Billion in the US means 10^9, but for example in Germany it is 10^12.
Using numbers would prevent confusion.

Probably this, although i probably wouldn't mention Bitcoin at all when doing my taxes.
@_date: 2013-07-22 17:05:59
What types of people do you want to attract to Bitcoin? Why would they not respect the advantages of Bitcoin that are recognized by libertarians?
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:36:10


wat. what did they expect the price to rise to?
@_date: 2013-03-15 19:03:16
So i guess this isn't..
I'm not even a skeptic, i believe over a longer time period the value will increase and be more than now, but apparently you cannot even talk about possible negative scenarios here without being downvoted.

I never claimed that Germany was in any way libertarian.

Most internet persons have a gif reaction folder among other image folders.

only if you bought when the bubble began. even if it corrects to $20 or so still more than the btc geeks have bought them for.
@_date: 2013-01-08 13:40:00
this exists already? i wanted to start working on bitcoin credit chips in the near future..
@_date: 2013-03-15 16:43:51


i've heard there are some critics here as well (although downvoted)
@_date: 2013-06-27 09:23:25
@_date: 2013-03-20 20:45:05
But what if someone does not want to use one of the services? He still has to pay. That's not acceptable.
@_date: 2013-06-27 10:59:39
Yeah if someone has access to it. I certainly hope that the government doesn't (naive as i am).
@_date: 2013-07-22 17:38:33
I'm just trying to find out why you think that a simple link would turn off many people from Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2013-06-27 09:05:26
Note that liberals in Europe means something different than in the US. It describes (more or less) libertarian people.
@_date: 2013-06-27 09:43:06
In fact, one of the few libertarian politicians - the one who requested information about Bitcoins tax status, is despised and avoided by most politicians here in Germany.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:57:24
I mean only in terms of loss in US dollars or Euros. Of course the exchange rate is relevant.
@_date: 2013-07-22 16:52:35


Well if they advocated Bitcoin for a long time as an essential part of their agenda, why not? (not that i knew about this)  
I'm getting the vibe that you just don't like libertarianism (and all of its subcultures) and therefore want it removed.
@_date: 2013-07-22 16:40:02
They're related thematically though, looking at the history of Bitcoin. I know Bitcoin does not have something to do with politics inherently, but why is a link under "Non-Bitcoin communities" bad? Viewers of both subs can broaden their horizon and discover something that may interest them.
@_date: 2013-07-22 13:47:22
Agreed. But the sidebar link doesn't hurt either.
@_date: 2013-03-20 21:12:57
You assume that there would not be law enforcement without taxation. As you said you would gladly pay for it voluntarily as kind of an insurance, so why not make it an insurance? I'd pay for it too! And if there are competing agencies maybe some power hungry cops could be held at bay.  
I digress, but the point is that the services which people value would be paid for voluntarily anyway, even without taxation. It's not like we are all kids who simply have a "fuck authority" attitude, i value parts of our society very much but at the same time i do not think it would decay as soon as there wasn't taxation (as a supposed price for society, like some frequently claim).
