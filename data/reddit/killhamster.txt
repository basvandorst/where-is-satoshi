Is what I was getting at. I love the video format wars and this is one of those weird myths that has persisted for some reason. Sony's major mistake was not licensing the tech and having short recording times.
If porn was hard to find on Betamax, it's because everything was hard to find on Betamax. I hated having a Beta deck because it meant I couldn't rent a damn thing anywhere.
If you can find some citation on the sony/porn thing I'll concede but it's my understanding that it's a pervasive myth that has no basis in reality. Porn was rare on Betamax because VHS was already dominating the market when studios really picked up on making releases on home video.

I now have 7 bitcoins to my name! Decided to buy them this week, so I checked out localbitcoins.
Got in touch via Skype with a guy that wanted to sell 7 bitcoins, I low-balled him at $700/each, it seemed like he needed the money so he agreed. We met in the local walmart parking lot late last night and he asked me to show him the money first. I did, all $4900 of it. Actually $5000, as I had forgotten to take out a bill, but I told him it was a tip. He transferred the 7 bitcoins to my wallet and once the transaction was confirmed I suddenly pulled a pocket knife on the guy. It was only like 2" long. He couldn't run anywhere because he was like 400 pounds and his rascal was looking pretty worn out. I ordered him to give me back the $5000. He started to piss his pants which made me a little uncomfortable, but then he handed it over.
As I drove off, he was staring pretty hard at my car, probably trying to read my plates, but the lenses on his glasses were probably too covered in pizza grease for him to make anything out. I imagine he went straight home and is now pretending the police give a shit about his situation. I sure am glad bitcoin doesn't have chargebacks, otherwise I'd be out $5000 and only have 7 bitcoins to show for it.
I'm so happy with myself and my wife is proud of me because we just made $5000. I don't know what I'm going to do with it. Such a wonderful experience.

Sometimes being old is pretty cool. We've seen some rad tech.
Laserdiscs were indeed awesome and I remember my buddy had a combination LD/5CD changer deck that was just mindblowing at the time. I was actually thinking of some of this goofy shit the other day that's completely useless now. We had a 50 disc CD changer for a while that we had to tediously program disc/track names into with a tiny uncomfortable IR remote. I keep more music on my phone now and it kind of makes me sad.
The last time I saw a functional phone booth was in Tokyo and their payphones put ours to shame.

Comedian Joe Rogan does what he can to promote virtually any conspiracy theory that he stumbles onto, apparently accepting them all uncritically with a wholesale embrace. He believes the Apollo astronauts did not land on the moon. He believes the U.S. government was behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He believes the Oliver Stone version of the Kennedy assassination. He believes aliens crashed at Roswell in 1947 and the government is covering it up. He thinks Men in Black from Project Blue Book stole his friend's camera, even though Project Blue Book ended over 38 years ago. The worst part is that he promotes these ideas to the public at every interview opportunity, but gives himself the intellectual "Get out of jail free" card of not needing any evidence by hiding behind the childish debate technique of saying "Hey, I'm just the guy asking questions." Joe, if you're going to put so much effort into promoting conspiracy theories and eroding what little rationality the public has left, at least have the courage to come forward with a cogent argument and well-sourced evidence, instead of the lameness of "I'm just the guy asking questions." Take the responsibility.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not blaming the currency itself. The community surrounding it, however, is mostly toxic and seems to revel in get-rich-quick scams and pyramid schemes, condemning them when they finally fail or some guy runs off with all the money, then welcoming with open arms the next one, seemingly without having learned a lesson at all from the experience. I have seen this happen over and over again and it is baffling.
If it's not blatant scams, it's exchanges getting "hacked" and disappearing overnight, the owners never being heard from again or, in some cases, they "recover" and pay back a portion of the stolen funds, and then disappear.
Why are bitcoiners so willing to accept these as inevitabilities and blindly leap into the next obvious scam?

Has nothing to do with scammers and other assorted buttcoin community scum.


No, but the fools who just hand their play money over to "exchanges," "banks," "investment firms," and other ponzis and obvious scams have certainly allowed for massive amounts of theft and fraud. Sure, the protocol has never been hacked, but the human element involved makes this easy as all hell.


Until someone gets 51% of the processing power. Regardless, the people involved with using the system are as solid as fucking mud.
Bitcoin was co-opted by horrifying sociopathic internet libertarians. This is a ***very bad thing***.

This is bullshit and you know it. All those exchanges/"banks"/wallet services/whatever seemed reputable and fair enough until they all took the money and ran, so to speak. Oh, sorry, they got "hacked," and some mysterious others stole the buttcoins.


You might not, but there are plenty of suckers who want to turn their no-effort "money" into more through some shady website or can't-lose "investment" that ends up fucking everyone over in the end. This has happened so many times that buttcoiners should know better but they keep lining up for the next big scam and throwing their Ron Paul funbux at people in the hopes that they can get more and cash out before the collapse.


Never said it was, just that its primary "investment " avenue seems to be a pyramid of Ponzis.

Hi, what is comedy? How do I laugh at a stupid or ridiculous thing? Only the newest of the new is acceptable for mockery. We now know that we can never be on the cutting edge of comedy, only showing off computers with video cards held in place by twine and zipties. Not even FPGAs can provide even the faintest chuckle. No, only the fastest and newest may be mocked and the return on humor investment on these is marginal at best. Why bother with anything? Nihil.

BUT THEY CAN BE DIVIDED UP TO EIGHT DECIMAL PLACES is one of those shrill cries about how versatile these awful things are, and it's *oh so convenient* to calculate and spend 0.008904* bitcoins instead of a dollar.

Banking regulations, bro. They're not make-believe. Moving $10K+ triggers reports that get sent to the IRS.
His terrible and shady answers to their questions will have also set off red flags but may not trigger the suspicious activity report since it seems to have been done in one lump sum. Either way, people are watching, because this shit is shady and bitcoin does not have a good reputation.
People in the real world have to deal with grown-up laws, like it or not.

From a user perspective, maybe not, but you also have to take into consideration the wishes of Jimbo and the rest of the Wikimedia folks. If they have objections to it, for whatever reasons, they're just not going to do it. I've been part of the admin team for a large wiki that eventually gave in and showed ads to support itself, and it can be a tough decision with arguments both for and against becoming very heated.

my advice would be: don't.
@_date: 2013-06-08 01:55:14
It can't have a reasonable supply of "coins," can't process quickly (transaction times are a joke and it's nowhere near as quick or convenient as other payment methods,) it can't scale well (seriously, the blockchain is up to what, nine gigs now? it was eight the other day when I brought this up.) Bitcoin has absolutely no oversight, and as a result it's a hotbed of scams, ponzi schemes, and other fraud. It's not at all user-friendly. etc. etc. etc.

You then have to consider the implications of such an action, however. I believe it is their intent to provide the information available on WP free of ads for ideological reasons.

There is no "probably," especially with the shady answers he gave. The bank is watching him very closely now, and the feds are probably keeping an eye on him as well.

@_date: 2013-03-27 17:22:47


Not once. However, I have had to deal with unauthorized recurring charges, charges made and then not refunded properly, and overcharges. If some bitcoiner were to do any of these to me, and they're not a perfect gentleman (or lady) then I'm SOL. I've seen this happen numerous times; someone makes a mistake and enters the wrong address and sends X amount to the wrong person who then doesn't return it because they're a greedy asshole. This leads to fights, callouts, and in one case, Roger Ver doxing someone. Super awesome consumer protection there.

how about instead of approaching these things as an investment vehicle, you just use them for their ostensibly intended purpose, and buy things with them?
