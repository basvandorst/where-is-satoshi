A Bitcoin device needs to be small to be portable - to use in shops etc. If it is that small it can indeed be lost or stolen - so can a physical wallet.
Maybe something on a chain that goes round the necks is the answer? Or a Bitvoin watch would be cool.

You can say that about Gold mining as well -but that is not what a ponzi scheme is.

Well cash is physical and needs to be stored securely. 
I would also suggest that a bank is the very worst place to keep money as we will no doubt see in the near future - in fact that is one reason people are keeping funds in Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is stored on computers and smart phones like any other data.
I agree completely about wallet stealing malware, but with 2FA, multi-sig, hardware authentication like the Trezor etc it is not an issue.
Incidentally - with blockchain.info you still technically keep the Bitcoin yourself because you need to keep the private keys.

I would have serious doubts about it myself - the "insurance company" is clearly only there for marketing purposes.
It is a conflict of interest because only they decide which claims to pay out on, and they can easily claim user negligence to avoid paying.
Xapo looks to me - as someone who has been in technology for 40 years and seen countless startups - like it has been put together to make a case to pitch for investment capital as opposed to anything that actually fulfils a useful purpose.
Any large companies have the technical ability to figure out how to configure a cold wallet with paper backup, and they keep total control over their own BTC.

Does anyone else find this sort of comment from the "Bitcoin Foundation" who purport to represent Bitcoin disconcerting?

We should keep in mind that it is impossible to regulate Bitcoin itself - only the central aspects such as exchanges and wallets.
The Blockchain.info wallet is seamlessly integrated with the Bitcoin blockchain and cannot be touched, whereas Coinbase is off-blockchain and can be regulated, accounts frozen etc.  
The future is Bitcoin being the defacto standard monetary system, but until then if exchanges, wallets etc are distributed and peer to peer, then there is nothing that can be done to regulate of interfere with it - which is how it should be.

Bitcoin does not pay interest or dividends it simply trades like a commodity or currency based on supply and demand. When people buy Bitcoin they are not expecting a return other than potential profit arising from an appreciation in price.
Bitcoin is very similar to Gold in that respect.

I define being bullish or bearish as a measure of sentiment - a feeling.
Of course it might be a gut feeling, wishful thinking or based on some more tangible analysis or fundamentals - everyone is different.
I think with many people it is a gut feeling, and there is nothing wrong with that.
In my experience the most powerful way of trading is to be in tune with the market - feel its pulse - what does it want to do next - and taking the bias and other factors out of it. Also having a deep knowledge of the fundamentals.
Either way, the polls are intended to be a measure of current sentiment whatever it is based upon.

Bitcoin is a currency in its own right, and whereas the price can vary, it cannot simply fail in the same way as being "too big".

Caution accepted, but there are plenty of precedents in other technologies that began as less than perfect, such as Linux as opposed to Unix.
Bitcoin, for all of its current shortcomings, has sheer momentum, weight of numbers and billions of investment Dollars in related companies behind it.
Any potential successor would have to be public domain/non-commercial, open source and not for the benefit of any individual or organisation.
Bitcoin will evolve and be made to do all that is required of it.

It doesn't matter if a wallet has 1 BTC or 1M BTC if the private keys are lost they are gone.
I know the lost keys is a long shot, but that would explain how that many BTC can go missing where all other explanations such as "transaction malleability" do not.
Not even Karpales could fail to notice 850K Bitcoins leaving his wallets - especially Mt. Gox own 100K - well - you would think not especially over a long period of time. Same for random theft - makes no sense.

The BTC will not be considered to be a primary debt - there are many classes of creditors ahead of the customers.

But is does not "pay a return" - meaning dividend or interest - or promises one - and there is no new capital - only new coins mined which is not the same - so it is not a ponzi scheme.
People buy Bitcoin to use as money, save or speculate with like any other currency or commodity.
Profit does not depend on further investors - the price can go up without any additional participants - again like Gold etc.

I can speak from experience actually, not academics.
I founded the first fully national Internet Service Provider in Britain over 20 years ago, when it really was primitive - slow modem connections, everything was customised and cobbled together to make it work etc.
Anyway, over the years I lost count of the number of times I heard that bandwidth, DNS, IP address space, server technology, routers etc etc would never scale to any sort of usable level, and certainly not in to the millions of users or speed that would support audio/video.
The fact is, and history supports this, that anything worthwhile - desktop computers which I was also involved with from day 1 - the Internet - will ALWAYS evolve as demanded by the people - so will Bitcoin.
The devs are not official devs, they are volunteers, and they will have to be flexible or be replaced - simple as that. There is too much investment in Bitcoin to be at the whim of a few techies. The same happened with Linux and other innovations - once once the people want it, the religious arguments become moot.
Having been in technology at a national and global level for 40 years, and seen it all before, I am totally confident that Bitcoin will evolve ad-infinitum to become whatever humanity wants it to be.
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:02:31
People are often happy to participate in ponzi or pyramid schemes out of greed, hoping to get out before it collapses. Of course there are always some that get the timing wrong.
Bitcoin of course has no resemblance to a ponzi or any other scheme.
Mt. Gox were running a sort of ponzi scheme, or at least fractional Bitcoin scheme, and users knew that but continued anyway.
It will take some time to detach Mt. Gox from Bitcoin for the public at large who know nothing about it, taking in all the propaganda instead.

You may have overlooked the fact that while the IRS now taxes Bitcoin as "property" thus imposing an onerous accounting overhead that the general public will never accept - why should they - other countries such as the UK have ruled Bitcoin is a currency and not taxable.
Even assuming a technical solution could be found, and only applied to US citizens, tax returns still become more complex when most find them complex anyway.
Don't expect the mainstream to find a solution to make Bitcoin work, Bitcoin must become acceptable to the mainstream by making it easier and better than currencies.
The practical benefits of using Bitcoin are obvious, but will be moot if it is not financially viable or desirable as is the case under the IRS ruling.

The issue is - no one is buying right now.

In a dispute Paypal/eBay always sides with the buyer for no other reason that the buyer can go straight to their card company to get a charge back if the Paypal decision goes against them.

Not if people believe that market is going much lower or are even undecided - the fear factor.
At these levels the market has been going nowhere and ignoring all good news while reacting to bad news - that is a weak market that needs to go lower until a level is reached where the perception is that it will not go much lower and is fairly priced.
Ultimately it is all about sentiment. If the market is climbing day after day from a lower base people will feel more bullish and confident, and there is no reason to stop feeling that way unless there are situations that stop it such as China.
I would also point out that this is exactly how BTC has been behaving - sells off and then begins a new bull run.

All the most successful traders in history including Jesse Livermore traded by being in tune with the market and the trend.
That is how open outcry traders trade in the futures pits - do you think they bother about all the stuff you mentioned in the chaos of the pit? No - they are tuned in to the market and trade instinctively.

The only future for Bitcoin exchange is peer to peer.
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:37:28
All this discussion will have been worthwhile if people learn the lessons from it.
While exchanges are still around - they will become extinct as regulation, ATM and peer to peer distributed systems take over - use exchanges to exchange - not store. I.e make the conversion and withdraw to a bank or trusted wallet.
Bitcoin exchanges will grow until the other systems take over and then they will  be too big to survive on ever reducing profits, going the way of Mt. Gox.
Caveat Emptor.

I agree - ANY online wallet service is a target for hackers and regulators.
If you don't hold the private keys you don't own the BTC plain and simple.
NO web based service is safe. 
Cold storage of the majority of BTC just keeping enough hot BTC to spend is the only way to go.
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:42:35
There should not be ANY BTC at an exchange.
An exchange should be matching buy and sell orders and managing the proceeds.
Mt. Gox lost so many BTC because customers chose to leave them there - using Mt. Gox as a bank, instead of doing the exchange and immediately withdrawing for safe local keeping.
The biggest asset are the customers, but that has been seriously compromised now unless whoever buys them is very convincing.

Bitcoin has always been legitimate. It is the efforts of mainstream media and their disinformation campaign that scares people away, and that is unlikely to change any time soon.
Approaching the mainstream perhaps, but this taxation ploy renders Bitcoin unusable for most people due to the extensive and complex accounting required. The general public simply wants to exchange Bitcoin for goods or services in the same way as cash - no longer possible in the US.
The UK tax authority have just declared Bitcoin a tax free currency.

Thank you for expanding on your thoughts - I respect that.
The fact is this is a community of 116,000 readers even now, countless of which are interested in the market, analysis, polls etc - that should be obvious by how many actually vote.
I am making a positive contribution by writing daily articles about every aspect of Bitcoin, not only the market, and sharing it here for those interested,
If you are not interested personally then simply ignore, dont read it and down vote it if you must, but bashing the efforts of others and ignoring the needs of others is not in the best interests of the community.

Who decides whether to make it official? Or how do we make it mainstream?
Bits and Sats are great for sure.
Of course if/when Bitcoin hits say $100,000 it will probably need to be divided by more decimal places, so we will need Bits, Sats and something else.

Do we really need hedge funds and big money?
The relatively few Bitcoin in circulation are for spending on goods and services, not to be cornered and controlled by banks.
From that perspective lack of regulation is a good thing.

Inflation is proportional to money creation/printing. The more money the Fed prints thereby increasing the money supply, the more it dilutes/devalues the currency as a whole, causes inflation and everything to become more expensive.
The same inflation applies to everyone using the currency, but in practice the vast majority of new money being printed is going to the banks which are using it to pay the "1%" bankers huge bonuses - for losing so much money - so indirectly rich people are benefiting.
So the "rich" want as much money printing as possible, and as they control the governments they want inflation. As usual it is the 99% who suffer - the Dollar as it is today has been devalued 86%.
Not many decades ago the man went out to work while the woman stayed at home to look after the children and house, and they had plenty of money. Then it became necessary for both partners to go out to work to pay the bills. After that came both partners working and having to take on debt, credit cards etc to pay the bills, after that started the house repossessions.
That is inflation and how the 99% are suffering and paying a heavy price.

Offshore banks keep reserves of all major currencies, particularly US Dollars. That is not the issue. If an exchange is located offshore and has access to other currencies through the local banking system then it can operate  - and there will always be enough reserves.
The issue is regulation of the actual Exchange where it is located - e.g. USA. If the exchange is located for example in the Cayman Islands, where all the banks carry large Dollar reserves, there is absolutely nothing the USA or any other country can do to regulate or interfere with it. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 16:01:20
I agree generally, but the IRS tax ruling has killed Bitcoin as a currency for US citizens, and other countries may follow.

Unfortunately because the BTC was all lumped in to a Gox account to which they hold/held the private keys, they are considered their assets.
This is the problem with all exchanges and off-block chain wallets. If you do not have the private keys you do not own the BTC - they were given over to the trust of Gox.

I have been heavily involved with the Internet from the early 90's, creating the first fully national service provider in Britain - a tremendous technical and logistical challenge - and involved with testing etc first web server, first web browser and much much more.
I can say that Bitcoin is following a very similar pattern to the Internet. In the beginning the Internet and those involved were ridiculed, called geeks etc and lots of calls for regulation.
I now see the same, if not more potential in Bitcoin,
I can say that Bitcoin is actually doing better than the Internet did because people are more technical these days and not afraid of computers and other technology such as smartphones.
My view is that the future of Bitcoin is assured as the de-facto standard Internet money and perhaps global money, but there will be many trials and tribulations along the way - but should feel fortunate to  be part of this crucial and exciting new technology.

Offshore in the broadest sense, as applied to tax havens for example, means off the shores of the USA or other major country -  - i.e. out of the jurisdiction of the USA. For example Panama is "offshore" even though part of mainland American continent. Even Japan where Mt. Gox is located is offshore to the USA, but can be regulated by Japan.
In practical terms it means offshore islands such as Grand Cayman, or offshore British islands, Gibraltar - there are hundreds of them - all with banking system and Internet connection.

Bitcoin cuts out the middleman completely as well as most fees and does not need a processor. 
Who will pay Paypal 3.4% to use Bitcoin when Bitcoin can be used directly?
Customer friendliness will be down to wallet design etc.

There will be escrow and multi-sig which will avoid many disputes.

Bitcoin cannot be regulated - impossible - due to its peer to peer, distributed, encrypted nature.
Only Bitcoin services can regulated such as wallets and exchanges. Offline software wallets such a Armory and Multibit cannot be regulated. On-blockchain web based wallets such as Blockchain.info cannot be regulated.
Exchanges that are not in a regulated jurisdiction, e.g. offshore cannot be regulated.
Governments that do not understand Bitcoin can say what they like, it doesnt mean that actually can regulate Bitcoin.
Shops can be regulated - i.e. be required to take photo ID from customers, but that would be very inefficient, and all shops need to do is to incorporate a trading branch outside of a regulating jurisdiction.e.g. offshore.

I understand what you are saying, the issue is theory versus actual application.
And I do understand Bitcoin completely like many other technologies - I never talk about anything that I do not fully understand or use. I own and operate all my own technology, Linux servers etc.
The point is - if the decision whether to launch Bitcoin was left to academia, then it would never happen and it would be lost to the world or written off in some research paper somewhere.
How many things were thought "crazy" before there time and then became part of every day life- telephone, TV - the list is endless.
Bitcoin is much more than an experiment. It was extremely well constructed from the start - and so far it has scaled just fine and will continue to do so - just as the Internet, computer CPU's and RAM etc did.
Why do you insist on calling non-academics/scientists "laymen"? Most of the greatest innovations in history were invented by "laymen" and not people with university degrees - in fact many of them dropped out of university.
I started out as a scientist myself - a chemistry degree and worked as a scientist for a multi-national chemical company - then I left and founded the first national computer software company - 37 years ago - there were no qualifications available for that even.

I have been a pioneer in both the computer and Internet industries over the last 37 years, and I see a recurring theme.
A bunch of enthusiastic techies get together who love to hack code, and decide to create a solution for a problem that does not even exist.
Because they are so young and enthusiastic and convincing, they often get VC companies to splurge millions in to the company, because they understand neither the industry, technology or principle behind what is being offered.
Usually all the VC millions go on fancy offices and high salaries before the "product" is even launched.
I am not saying Ethereum is like this - I dont know - but I do know that Bitcoin is the future, nothing will replace it, and the entire focus should be on evolving Bitcoin to a world class monetary system.

I was heavily involved in both the beginning of the desktop computer and Internet. Everyone said the same about them - in fact they were more skeptical than with Bitcoin.
I personally do not see how Bitcoin could possibly fail - ymmv.

Well it isn't that obvious to most. I have been tracking the markets for 35 years as well as researching deep in to the dynamics and those behind the markets and it is clear to me that the USD is in big trouble.
50% of the US GDP is military - they need wars to survive which is why they have been starting wars ever from Vietnam - keep as them in business - just - along with petro-Dollar. Then along comes Putin and deprives Washington/Pentagon of further profitable wars. That is why they are after Russia, but Putin is way too smart for Obama and co.
If Putin refuses payment in USD and only accepts other currencies the USD and global banking system is toast - and it would take out the British Pound, Euro and most other fiat currencies as well.
This is why Russia and China have been amassing all the Gold they can get - a lot of it - they know what is coming and are prepare for it.
People in the street will buy Bitcoin and Gold/Silver, and the BTC price would likely rocket.

So you think your pending PhD makes you an expert?
40 years technical involvement in the trenches, doing real development and solving real problems, as well as being involved in core Internet technologies such as tester for the first web server, web browser and much more, makes me a bit more than a "laymen". As a matter of fact I used to advise university lecturers who would phone my company to ask about the latest developments.
Of course no one is going to de-throne the Bitcoin developers and neither should they. The point I was making is that they have a responsibility to an ever larger audience and huge investment, they will have to be flexible and not stick to their own ideas and ambitions. More developers are needed anyway - too few right now.
Desktop computers were an experiment, the Internet was an experiment - most worthwhile innovations began as experiments.
Bitcoin is much more than an experiment, it is a reality. I believe it will succeed because it must succeed, and when humanity wants something to succeed it will.
If it was left to academics pontificating about things, nothing would ever get done - it would always be dismissed on some technicality.

The only future Bitcoin has is totally decentralised, distributed and peer to peer.

No - I never down vote without good reason, even if I don't agree, because everyone is entitled to an opinion.

It seems to me that they were effectively stolen because they were used and still  in circulation. Mt. Gox just doesnt have them any more.

According to latest reports, Gox is filing for bankruptcy - so the end of them.

I have been involved with the Internet from the beginning - set up the first national ISP in Britain, was a tester for first web server, browser and involved in testing and development of numerous other products and services.
I would say that comparing Bitcoin to 1993 is about right.
Everyone said the Internet would not scale. I started serving people with a 256kbs modem and our routers - which were modified Linux boxes with serial interfaces - and servers were not designed for the Internet - nothing was - it was a case of hacking and making it work. We had to write our own software to connect Windows to the Internet even including modem dialler.
I am sure Bitcoin can be made to scale, but not as it is programmed today. Also the blockchain will become massive, and downloading it needing a lot of bandwidth and storage - so that will need addressing as well.

The market is definitely becoming more bullish.
I expect further consolidation around $500 then a new leg of the long term bull market to begin.

I lived in the Isle of Man for 19 years, just up the road from the Grandstand - the atmosphere and racing is amazing.

Bitcoin is consolidating.
The $1000+ was an anomaly caused by Chinese buyers, the price is fair now.
The ultimate price will be many orders of magnitude higher than today, so hold and be patient.

Actually it makes complete sense and already happening - Local Bitcoins for example. There are many peer to peer systems on the Internet.
All it needs is a more sophisticated version of Local Bitcoins which is easily doable.

Not by me it hasn't. This one looks convincing to me - but of course all it takes is a whale to sell it short.

Well we will have to disagree on that one :)

I think "Now accepting Bitcoin" on Wikipedia pages would be a win-win situation. 
The Bitcoin community is extremely generous as witnessed by the current donation initiative for Dorian Sakamoto which has raised $27K in Bitcoin so far in just a few days.

If the market does capitulate to the lower level it will not stay there long I am sure. People will buy all they can - unlikely get another opportunity.
Either way a period of consolidation would be a good thing to provide the basis for the next leg of the bull market.

I disagree. How Bitcoin has behaved until recently was totally unrealistic. It is behaving more normally now and will grow organically at a more sustainable rate.

That option has been added retrospectively, but I agree it should have been added to start with.
Will ensure all possibilities are included in future - thanks for pointing it out.

The reason for that is - and as happens in all countries with high inflation -people want to spend their money to convert it in to food and hard assets which are always getting more expensive.
In a deflationary system it is the opposite. The currency increases in value so more sense to hold the currency and have more buying power later. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:12:11
The USD like the Dow is just delusion - no resemblance to reality - manipulated to make people think that all is well with the "economy". It isn't - with countless trillions of debt, the USD is bankrupt.
That said, since XBT/USD is an exchange rate pair, if the Dollar gets stronger the value of Bitcoin will be proportionately weaker - same with everything denominated in USD - so that might account for a little bit of the price drop.
The underlying reason is supply and demand. There are no new buyers while miners and merchants are dumping BTC constantly, therefore suppressing the price.
An equilibrium will be reached and BTC find a low, but it is going to likely be at least 6 months to a year to know where that low point is for sure. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 12:03:40
I would say the blockchain technology is analogous to TCP/IP with Bitcoin running on top of it - as could many other applications.
So HTTP is to TCP/IP as Bitcoin is to the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-01-27 15:42:05
If Bitcoin replaced even a fraction of a major fiat currency it would be worth over a trillion in circulation.
Also XBT/USD is an exchange rate pair. When the monopoly money generated out of thin air called the "US Dollar" implodes, and is reduced to worthless, Bitcoin only need hold its value to be worth trillions.
There are multiple scenarios that could push BTC to many orders of magnitude where it is today.

I have been heavily involved with the Internet for 25 years - before it was even called the Internet - was involved with testing Mosaic and the first web server - before that it was a text app called "Gopher" - and many other technologies being used today - founded the first ISP to bring the Internet to the whole of Britain.
I agree with this excellent article. The parallels with the Internet and Web with Bitcoin are very close. I remember the immense challenges in providing Internet services  - no server software, mass connectivity, PC software etc available - making it work and keeping it running on very slow modems. We had to write our own Windows software to give to people that enabled an Internet connection - Windows did not have it.
I also remember that most users were technically competent enthusiasts who could hook up to the Internet at all.
Many people told me that the Internet was a passing fad for geeks and nerds and would never take off because it served no purpose. That sounds familiar with what people say about Bitcoin.
The rest is history.
Bitcoin is following an almost identical but much faster trajectory.
Everything that needs to happen is happening and happening fast, it is just a matter of reaching critical mass and crossing over in to the mainstream.
It will happen. When? I think we are looking at 3 to 5 years depending on many factors. When the global financial system inevitably implodes it will be a major catalyst for Bitcoin.
In the meantime price is irrelevant - it needs to find a base and equilibrium to move up from. That could happen this year, but it will not be going to the moon until mainstream acceptance happens. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 11:26:56
If you think banks are secure, watch what happens when the global financial system implodes soon. I hope you are not trusting the banks to keep your cash safe - more likely they will bail it in and empty your account. 
I never keep more cash in banks that I need to pay regular bills, online transactions etc.
Instead I have always kept the bulk of my assets in gold and silver, selling when I need to for cash.
I would like to store in Bitcoin of course, but not until it reaches the floor and a sustained uptrend is established.  
@_date: 2015-01-27 07:35:47
I totally agree with this. Just because Coinbase is regulated does not mean we are forced to use Coinbase. For Bitcoin to become mainstream which is the key to its success as a de-facto alternative to fiat, it must  first be accepted by the mainstream. Aside from ease of use - yet to be achieved for most - a trusted system is crucial. Yes - I know that trusting banks is totally misguided, but that is a different matter, it is public perception that matters.
Just as fiat has always had a thriving anonymous, tax free offshore banking industry - used by those in the know - so too will Bitcoin have an offshore exchange industry - it is happening right now - as well as darknets etc. which the rest of us can use.
Eric is right - let exchanges like Coinbase pseudo-legitimise Bitcoin for the majority and make it mainstream, and the rest of us can stay beneath the radar.
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:25:01
With all the BTC being dumped by miners - almost all of it at these prices just to remain in the game, it is surprising that the price has held up as well as it has.
Only new mainstream participants will change things around, and there is nothing out there that could be a catalyst for that.
BTC needs to be extremely simple to use - like cards - and totally non-technical - for mainstream acceptance.
@_date: 2015-01-27 12:36:33
I think most here share your concerns including me and have also written a lot on the web about these very matters.
However, if Bitcoin is to make the mainstream it is time to be pragmatic and put idealism aside in favour of the future of Bitcoin as a whole.
In my 25 years in the Internet I have seen this sort of situation many times yet it always works out fine in the end.
There will always be plenty of legit offshore exchanges to trade Bitcoin anonymously - we can use those while the mainstream can use the likes of Coinbase.
I am intrigued to see what Circle will do.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:30:58
Hope they change the data source from Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2014-03-16 17:27:54
Or hardware based devices such as the Trezor or BitSafe which offer complete security with ease of use.
