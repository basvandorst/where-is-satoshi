Nuclear War is not good for bitcoin, because it destroys the currently fragile technology infrastructure supporting it.  Even its EM side-effects render electronics obsolete.  Of course the blockchain is data and copies of it are everywhere, so it would likely survive and come back up somehow.
I think the *threat* of nuclear war is good for bitcoin though because it falls in the category of loss of faith in traditional institutions to ensure prosperity and safety, which drives interest in bitcoin as safe haven.

I don't see how "voting" is even a possible option. There's massive pressure not to fork, and that is inherent in the reality of many users with diverse needs relying on it.  Ultimately, difficult or not, consensus (as opposed to majority vote) is the only way to go forward without dividing the user base.  I'm not saying there's always an outcome that can make everyone happy, just that the dynamics of the situation are biased to make as many people happy as possible.  This may be less true as bitcoin becomes more entrenched, but at this stage anyway the risk of disenfranchising users is an existential risk.

You can use Purse.io to buy things from Amazon using bitcoin, and actually get a discount.  Sometimes books are found in overstock.com's catalog as well.  Another option, which I've only used one time, is snapcard, which bridges bitcoin with a wide range of ecommerce sites using a bookmarklet.
Do you ever travel by air?  I haven't used a credit/debit card to buy airline tickets since early 2013, thanks to bitcoin, using cheapair.com.
Here's an example of bitcoin helping me tremendously in a situation: I couldn't get cash from ATMs because the bank was taking their time to send me a new ATM card after having had my card cloned and robbed from when I used it at a CVS ATM.  During that week and a half period I attended a event in Oakland where many things were cash-only.  Thanks to bitcoin, and Mycelium Local Trader, I was able to arrange a transaction with someone near UC Berkeley almost immediately.

I appreciate facebook raising awareness about email encryption and privacy practices, but notice that when they send you these encrypted notification messages they can easily send the same message unencrypted to a government agency.  And being a U.S. corporation, you can be sure that whatever they say publicly, they are giving the government whatever is asked of them in secret.
It's a great start though. What would be even better is for Facebook to advance and encourage (through a browser plugin perhaps) client side PGP encryption of chat messages.

This is great... I think they should change it to allow for more pseudonymity though. Create any identity, multiple identities that you manage, etc. As far the decentralized namespace (glad they made the right choice, to not create another centralized point of trust/failure, BTW.)

To me the best reason a government might have for creating bitcoin (not mentioned by pg) is that transactions are public, though people feel comfort due to the pseudonymity. Not in a thousand years would people agree to a government-forced effort to impose such transparency on our personal financial lives.
At least that's a reason why governments might not try to stop it, now that it exists and is gaining wider adoption.
Personally, I think it was an independent group of cypherpunk hackers, possibly Nick Szabo and a team he brought together (not because of the half-assed stylometric effort but because of all the other evidence for this.)

I wouldn't say Ripple is a scam, but they have a weak story on trust/node integrity (not trust-free, based on trust-- and right now there are not yet any third-party validator nodes, they are still all run by the Ripple company) and an even weaker story on how coins are distributed (no incentive system, just ad hoc distribution by the system's creators).
It's important not to write off Ripple as "centralized", this is false, its actual design is decentralized. Many people will hear "centralized" and not bother looking any further into how it works. Basically, Ripple addresses the double-spending problem without mining, using what are called validator nodes, which are kind of analogous to the purpose miners serve in bitcoin (and all of its variants, ltc, doge etc) that is to say they ensure that the public ledger is kept in agreement and that no double spending may occur. To grossly simplify here a bit, the validator nodes vote on every transaction, and have a system of coming to agreement when there is a conflict, and the entire network must agree in order for a transaction to be added to the ledger.
The obvious advantage of that is the transactions are completely verified in seconds rather than minutes. But there are some caveats. One is that, as mentioned above, the company that started Ripple is still trying to figure out how to put validator nodes into the hands of a large number of  independent parties (the fact that they currently run all of the validators is why it is often called a centralized system, which it is until they get others running validators.)
I personally don't yet have much interest in using Ripple, but I think it has some good ideas. It also has some bad ideas. I think some of the bad ideas, such as the lack of automated trust, and the non-approach to distributing funds, are not unsolvable problems for some other Ripple-like currency.

Bitcoin + Coinbase shiftcard is essentially Venmo with much shorter times to be able to actually use the money you transfer.  Being able to use the money in an hour versus 10 minutes is not just a matter of degree, it is a qualitative difference in the usefulness of the solution.

Anarcho-capitalists and left-wing market-anarchists are very close on many questions.  Both support radically open p2p markets with no state/centralized regulatory control.  However the former uses the word "capitalism" and the latter calls itself "anti-capitalist".  The former criticizes crony capitalism and corporatism, but left-wing market anarchists argue that this critique does not go far enough, allowing for statism to creep back in to "free" markets.  The solutions offered build on thought developed in the libertarian socialist (anarchist) tradition, American individualist socialism traditon (Tucker, Spooner, DeCleyre, etc), and the Austrian economic tradition (Mises, Rothbard, etc), among other sources.

The interviewees had a lot of pretty impressive responses IMO, especially for people not engaging with it at a technical level.  Most of them are better at talking about than Craig Wright is able to, IMO!

The whitepaper has airtime for ruminations like "Humanity is not wild, but engineered. It is, and always was, engineered and manipulated by relatively small groups of people," but little to say fleshing out the claims that seem worthy of a nobel prize in mathematics.

The flaw in that thinking is that it means bitcoin *already* lacks that trust-free property, due to extreme mining centralization.  Bitcoin should not be protected by miners' reflection on the look of actions undermining confidence (although that incentive might be a weak protection that will help) it should be protected by it being actually resilient to control by a few.  Unfortunately control is actually in the hands of a few, and that might mean bitcoin is ultimately not 100% what we hoped it would be. As for the value, I could see it continuing to increase despite these known imperfections. After all, these flaws undermining the core of bitcoin's real unique value have been widely known about for years, and yet it keeps growing while no alternative currency has come anywhere close.

I'm nowhere near knowledgeable enough to definitively take down the claims or design of this system, but what little I do know triggers some bullshit detectors for me.  1. it's based on dependently typed lambda calculus, but my sense of the state of the art is that it is there are major problems left to solve before dependent types become useful for practical applications that non-trivially benefit from their promised superpowers. 2. they claim that dependent types solve the problem of computational undecidability that turing complete languages suffer from. In what sense is that true?

Here's another twist: assuming the NSA is not bluffing, Donald Trump  knows who Satoshi is. Obama had them use stylographic analysis to unmask the author of the paper supposedly.

I would have predicted that people would run to move their funds to the secure chain (BTC) but that doesn't seem to be happening.  It seems odd that BCH nonsense would have any impact on BTC other than that, although there's a lot of uninformed speculation now so a model based on traders having a clue might not be helpful in predicting what happens.

The idea of a portfolio is typically in the context of traditional investing.  Many of us have never bought a stock. Bitcoin lowers the barrier to entry. Whether to place a bet on it going up in value or for use as money/store of value.

The problem a blockchain solves is open permissionless participation in consensus on global record of a total ordering of events.  A private blockchain is therefore an oxymoron, because right from the outset it aims to restrict participation to authorized users. It's just a merkle tree.
Certificate Transparency is an example of a use of a merkle tree, which is great, it's just not a blockchain.  It doesn't need to be a blockchain for the problem it solves, because the order doesn't matter.
For decentralized money, you do in fact need a blockchain.  The order of transactions matters, because double-spending is possible without it.
As for whether a token is required for a blockchain, in all existing approaches to open permissionless ledgers, the token plays an important role in the functioning of the system, and is therefore indispensible.  Miners are incentivized to spend their computing resources by receiving the block reward (probabilistically.) Miners are needed because without proof of work, anyone could pretend to be a zillion different nodes (a sybil attack), so no scheme of accepting a consensus view of the total event ordering could be trusted.

Ok, this is not a terrible argument. I'm less sold on the text analysis than on the guess that others already made years ago regarding Szabo. In a way it's kind of like "duh", maybe the person who worked on something (bitgold) that bitcoin is more closely based on than anything else, but it is not cited as a source, is the author. That's what is more convincing to me.
In Szabo's response to gwern, he suggests that either Hal Finney or Wei Dai are possibly Satoshi. It is interesting that he would state that some of his peers are the most likely candidates. That logic would more strongly imply that he is the most likely Satoshi Nakamoto (possibly collaborating with others of course), and is perhaps even giving an intentional wink to suggest that, given this logic.
But who is Skye Grey though? This appears to be their only blog post, probably a one-off created blog for anonymity.
