I would say if I was top 6 at virtually anything anywhere I would be making over 500k. Top 6 is a ridiculously rare achievement in any field, especially one like investment research where there are hundreds of thousands of people doing the work.  The average investment researcher is probably earning $100k, which is less than the $120k that developers are making. Worse yet, researchers claim to work 70 hour weeks (though I really doubt the truth of it).

The alphanumeric is likely your address. You can look it up on an explorer to see how many bitcoins you have. The long string of words (likely 12 or 24) is a mnemonic key, which is functionally your private key. A pin, no idea, except if your friend also gave you a ledger hardware wallet. You don’t likely need a pin or anything. Just download a reputable bitcoin wallet and type in your long string of words to see if it gives access to the address

The difficult thing is, say the price of BTC suddenly fell to $300. Then the fee would be $0.25. But then it would be attractive and more people would want to use it, so the price would go up and so would the fee. Eventually you reach an equilibrium where bitcoin is used at capacity by people who feel the fee is fair.

While true, it's arguably never correct to sell. Because we don't know if the "correction" will start at 25000 and then dip to 18000. History has shown this to be very hard to predict. Missing continued increases can be much more costly than getting hit by a dip.

No, but it will be a major talking point during the next bubble. However, the price can only get so high relative to the price of energy, and that time is nearing. At some point price will only double every 4 years, and then you'll see mining stagnate. If the price does less than double in four years, as it will in its maturity, mining will decline. I predict that mining will be the highest during the next bubble (2019-2024). Then, green energy sources will take over and most of the future generation would be using green sources, so it wouldn't be a problem.

You think bitcoin is pogs and then say to create something. How about a decentralized currency with Thousands if developers, tens of billions traded every single day? Is that worth anything?

The issue I have is I got in over 3 years ago and feel like nothing has happened since then. Sure the price is going up but why? I've never used any of my Bitcoins and don't know anyone who has. So is it really a ponzi that will crash once nobody new comes around to hold ? I sold a few recently because I had them in coinbase but I couldn't bring myself to buy back in somewhere else. I can't be the only one who feels this way. If you bought in at $1 and sold at some point how could you ever fathom getting back in? I feel like I have an anchoring bias at the price I originally bought

I recently sold most (not all) of my coins because many things that people were saying were great about bitcoin in 2013 are not true today. One of the greatest selling points was low fees and that is no longer true and it is not competitive. I also sold my coins because nothing really that interesting has happened with bitcoin since 2013. There is not much more merchant adoption. People aren't using it for really much of anything other than holding, and to me that seems like a failure. It is often called the internet of money but it is developing very very slowly in comparison. WWW was created in 1989. 8 years later in 1997, nearly 2% of the world was using the internet. Despite the fact that bitcoin exists on the internet and is very readily accessible for all, almost nobody is using it.
Since selling some of my bitcoins I have noticed a few things, but the most important is that I feel that I really don't want to buy any more.

It's because nobody is actually accepting bitcoins. All the systems out there that merchants are using instantly convert bitcoins to dollars, which is the same as selling bitcoins.

Not likely. Myspace was not nearly as popular as facebook is today. It's going to be very hard for something generic to come along and give a reason for people to set up an additional social network home. You think Myspace's measly 2 year life span compares to facebook you are wrong. Remember when Myspace sold in its peak for $580M? Facebook is worth 373 times that amount today. Facebook will be the dominant social network for decades. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:14:32
I wouldn't. The problem with bitcoin as an investment is that you can participate in many of the benefits of bitcoin without having any exposure to it. The vast majority of people will participate this way, so the expectation that the future of bitcoin will require more people to hold it thus pushing up the price is not true. The price of a bitcoin could feasibly be $1 even with all things positive.

@_date: 2014-04-08 06:43:00
That's great, but that's not necessarily maximizing because you don't know the probabilities of the payouts. Plus the person you replied to wasn't attempting to maximize anything, just showing that you can set up a profit on each side. The problem with what you did is the downside
Your payoff on win:
-1000 + 444 + 1000 = 444
Your payoff on loss:
-1000 + 4444 - 1000 = 2444
OP payoff on win:
-450 + 200 + 1000 = 750
OP payoff on loss
-450 + 2000 - 1000 = 550
x = probability of win
(x) 444 + (1-x) 2444
(x) 750 + (1-x) 550
So, is your set up really better? Depends on the probabilities. Breakeven is 86% probability to win (if the probability that bitcoin reaches 200 before 2000 is 86%, buying 1 bitcoin is better than buyin $1000 of bitcoin). 
Someone else might look at past volatility to determine the likelihood that bitcoin reaches 2000 before hitting 200, could be an interesting analysis.

Yeah you could argue that bitcoin killer app becomes securing independent asset networks in that case. I don’t see why you wouldn’t pay $20 or even more when that security represents 100000 transactions done on separate chains. It’s essentially layer two with economic incentive to “stake” in useful networks. But that’s a very anti maximalist viewpoint since you assume bitcoin can’t really be used for anything but a security engine for large networks. I don’t hate it for a store of value narrative

I'm never using this. Maybe good for the exchanges in this club, but this shouldn't be news for bitcoin users. Don't use or rely on these centralized solutions for bitcoin. Sure, let private business clubs keep trusted tally of who owes what I guess. No reason to prevent that. But if ever bitcoin starts to depend on commercial, presumably for-profit technologies for transfers, you should be concerned. 
My impression is that the usefulness here is to allow exchanges to transfer assets with each other both quickly and cheaply.  It could also dramatically reduce transactions on chain, which is also good. But this seems mostly useful for day traders and exchange arbitragers, not actual users.

Because the borrowing rate would be massively lower? You won't have 6% student loans in a bitcoin economy, they'd like 1-3%. A secondly, when bitcoin is adopted it wouldn't be very volatile, so it wouldn't be as risky to take a loan in these conditions.

if you are DCA in to BTC, basically a spend-and-replacer, you will almost always have some lots at a loss that you can use for your spending. If not, you are literally at the ATH of bitcoin and probably not as bothered by it. So this idea that crypto is bad to spend because of taxes is bullshit.

That’s probably not the case yet just based on its cost. Sure there are a few people with millions of dollars of bitcoin and millions of other assets but they are very rare even among millionaires. With bitcoin at $150k the millionaire status is still up for grabs for most people who want it

It will be profitable. But if bitcoin price stays the same then security is what halves. Without fees It doesn’t take long for the profitability break even to be near zero total security.

An attacked can use illiquid markets to hold up the price of an attacked fork long enough to get passive miners to mine, so hash rate is not informative enough. These attacks can last years I suspect, and so it’s best to hold coins of all forks. A fork that has economic value is still contending. I don’t think these votes resolve in 1 hour. You have to wait for the attacker to run out of money, and in the meantime you should just hold and not change assets. People storing value on bitcoin and making no action are at zero risk as they have value on all chains and attacks go to zero eventually.

When the reward halves the mining halves, all else equal. This means bitcoin can sustain a 19% annual ROI forever and the mining will not increase materially. Mining isn't just for minting new coins, it's for protecting old ones. Nobody is going to double their mining just because the reward is halved. They either won't sell anymore until the price doubles, or they'll turn off half their machines.

There aren't greater fools buying bitcoin because bitcoin acts as a great portfolio diversifier. It is therefore suboptimal to not have some bitcoin. Currently, the greater fools are those who have zero bitcoin, because their portfolio is higher risk than it needs to be. When you buy bitcoin at 3%, you aren't even speculating, you are optimizing. Currently, when you buy more than 3% bitcoin you are speculating that the rest of society will optimize their portfolios to minimize its volatility and that this transfer of wealth mathematically must result in high prices for bitcoin ($~150K-300K). 
@_date: 2019-01-18 22:29:52
If you hold your coins on an exchange, they have the private key and really just transfer digits back and forth like upvotes on reddit. You hope that when you request them to send you actual bitcoins that they actually still have their keys secured and that they can send you bitcoins. This typically leads to exchanges being huge targets for hackers because they end up storing value for like 10K people, so why hack 10K people when you can just hack 1?
Keep them in a wallet is just a phrase used to say 'know the private key to an address that has coins'. You can use a software wallet for this, which gives you functionality to transfer the coins easily to others, but the risk is that your private key is not super secure from malware, key loggers, etc. The transfers require entering your key, AKA password. All wallets typically also keep a record of all the transfers you have made from various addresses and other convenient information about the cryptocurrency
A paper wallet is something you print out with your private key on it. You usually make this thing while offline. You dont have any functionality to send money to anyone because it isnt software, but it's not vulernable to malware and keyloggers because its never touched the internet (or possibly even a computer). This is often referred to a cold wallet, particulary because you dont do anything with it but store coins.
Then there are hardware wallets. They encrypt and secure the key and do transaction signing in a way that malware and keyloggers cant access, so you get the benefit of software wallets for using and paper wallets for storing.
Now one critical question for you. Why are you on if you don't know how bitcoin works? Join us here and learn what bitcoin is, and you won't return there after long.

The reason cryptocurrencies will be adopted by big wealth managers is because the fees for an SP500 index is fast approaching 0.08% or lower, whereas cryptocurrencices, while much small market cap, will likely be charging 3-5% annual management fees. So SP500 has ~24 trillion market cap, and crypto has $0.4 trillion, but its fees are 40x larger. 0.4 * 40 = $16 trillion equivalence. But it's not equivalent, because there is no real competition yet, and increased competition will be met with increased market caps anyways, so crypto as an asset class will remain super attractive to large asset managers for the next decade.

A project that has an ideology of never changing to make it more dependable and reliable long term (as bitcoin does) is different than one that constantly changes and takes on that risk. If bitcoin gets obsoleted by these fast moving technologies it doesn't mean the fast moving technology can get obsoleted. It used to be a saying that if an altcoin had a good technology bitcoin would adopt it and thats why it cant be obsoleted, but this isn't the way it works these days. Stability and dependability have become more important than innovation. So far that ideology is working for bitcoin. Still, if another altcoin does adopt the best technology and does so often, then a new tech coming out doesnt just obsolete it since they could just adopt it. You could argue that the higher value a coin becomes, the more likely it will prefer stability and no changes, which I think is probably fair and likely, so your statement is likely true in practice, but not necessarily true. Besides, you could hold a managed basket of cryptos and gain exposure to all the changes at once and avoid this problem entirely, so you could still have crypto as a store of value, but maximalism in any context would be dead.
I think bitcoin itself depends on high volatility to survive, so the store of value narrative is not really one like gold. A good bitcoin manager is one that harvest volatility, which means buying dips but also selling bubbles, which will come again and again and again for the rest of bitcoins life.

Depends how rich you are. If you are poor, young, and educated, even being 100% crypto is fine. Leverage is stupid though, because volatility will consume all your money. When I started I did 5% into crypto. That was the reasonable thing to do, but the smart thing to do was to be 20-30%. When the market crashed in 2014, my 5% lost me $3000. Who fucking cares?

Institutions can enter through doing business with the same custodians who would wrap their holdings in an ETF bow. Gemini for example, you can just buy bitcoins and store them there. The user experience for buying bitcoin is the same as it is for buying ETFs. Hop on a computer and click a few buttons. This isnt' the same for other things like owning physical gold, so ETFs make a lot more sense for that kind of commodity. 
Additionally, a Bitcoin ETF is materially inferior to custodied bitcoin. The liquidity is drastically reduced in an ETF and the trading hours are tiny compared to 24/7. And you likely have significant fees. I have no idea why anyone would actually want an ETF when similar custody services are already available and superior.

Take $8000 usd buy bitcoin, sell bitcoin for $20000 USA of rial, sell rial for $20000, repeat. Rial is always sold, so it’s price declines relative to usd. More bitcoin is purchased so it’s price increases towards $20000. More bitcoin is demanded by US fiat and rial fiat  because it’s appreciating  in both. This causes a contagion where people flee to bitcoin even though only one country fiat was out of balance

So stop buying scams. It's really not that hard. It's also not fair for you to say 96% of cryptocurrency have collapsed or exit scammed. Collapsing and exiting scamming are not the same, technically nor morally. You do this to make it seem like its all exit scams, when really that's quite rare. Most of these collapses are because people start new networks and nobody joins. That's like saying the internet companies are worthless because most websites don't survive, and yet you probably own many internet stocks.

Yeah I use some of those. A bit different than tricking bitcoin users, who presumably care about decentralization and trustless finance, to use a custodial wallet for their assets though. I suppose you can just move it all into bitcoin ETFs from fidelity some day and never use on chain again. But if you're going to go custodial, you probably want a reputable custodian. I have no idea who bluewallet is and I dont think they have a reputation at all.

Bitcoin holders are unaffected by forks. If you had bitcoin before you have both now. Only people accidentally buying BCH get stung and they deserve it. I’ve not known a single person who accidentally bought a coin or any product for that matter so I can only imagine the level of recklessness required to achieve that here. These buyers are the most dangerous to the space anyways because they contribute so much to bubbles and crashes with their fomo.

I'm all for mainstream shilling, not just because it would make the price increase, but the price HAS to increase to attract more capital, developers, businesses and as a result produce a sturdier ecosystem that can't be destroyed. i don't care who does their part in getting the message out nor what their financial motivations are for doing that, the end result is the same for the quality of the asset class. Right now, everyone makes their money by shilling and getting their investments to go up in value. later, the price will be pretty stable, and businesses will make their money by actual services (like coinbase for example, which is a great example of a late-stage crypto business). These late-stage businesses will include CNBC, Goldman Sachs, Amazon, you name it. They won't make money by the price increasing, because ultimately it will be pretty stable at $700K a coin, they'll making money by moving money and providing services. The same as its been for banking for centuries.

I come from an investing background, what's great about bitcoin is it has no payroll and not debt obligation, yet produces massive amounts of innovation rivaling many billion dollar companies.

[Here's a list of some Bitcoin companies, many of which employ dozens of people](
[Here's some for bitcoin](
[Here's over 1,200 Ethereum projects]( A single project from this list,[golem]( has 30 contributors and nearly 6000 commits.
[Here's a handful of projects on NEO](
[Bitcoin repo shows 486 contributions and ~2000 commits so far this year.]( And that doesn't even include external projects like [lightning network]( which itself has 111 contributors and ~4000 commits since its creation in late 2016. 
Investment in blockchain businesses and projects are $400 million so far this year. This is to fuel business that support the ecosystem, and doesn't include ICOs.  $400 million in new business so far this quarter could add over 1000 full time jobs. Facebook, which is currently valued at nearly 2x the total market cap of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem has 25000 employees. Back in 2014 when it was valued at the same market cap of the crypto ecosystem, they have 9100 employees. 
searching "blockchain" on indeed.com yields [1500 results]( This is only people who are willing to pay you to work for them to build their blockchain business. This number doesn't include the number of new entrants contributing to free and open source projects.
Summing all this together, it quickly becomes clear that this industry will, and possibly already does, benefit from more engineering work than any single for-profit technology company and it doesn't pay a dime for it. 
The cryptocurrency ecosystem is at worst fairly valued right now, but most likely severely undervalued. It isn't a single company that exists to generate profit and pay back debts, and it grows and supports a robust ecosystem of businesses, much like the internet. If the internet had a valuation, it would likely be in hundreds of trillions. Cryptocurrency, as a niche of this, will mature to a valuation in the tens of trillions, larger than any single company. But of course, not everyone agrees with my assessment or we'd already be mostly the way there. nevertheless, cryptocurrency remains the best possible investment that exists in the world today.

If it gets to $1m and nobody is using it, your definition of use needs modification. One of bitcoins best use cases is to minimize portfolio variance in wealth management. You need 1-3% for this effect, and that’s $4-12 trillion market cap. The whole world can continue to use Venmo and this will still be bitcoins best use case. This is why I hold bitcoin so it’s already succeeding in its use case for me. When Btc is $1m it’s use case may improve or worsen depending on how it’s correlations change. If it’s volatility declines but it’s correlation stays the same, it’s weight can rationally increase even further. My guess is that volatility will decline and correlations will increase, so target allocations won’t change much

Frequent and start to learn the ways. You can still achieve early retirement with a career change and investing 4 years and some money is a good play. Not everyone needs to or wants to be a programmer but that still is the fastest and cheapest way to a good income. So I’d recommend looking into all the variety of programmer type roles there are. There are so many you’re certain to find a niche you’d like. My advice would be to try to get one bitcoin (or $5k worth), but also to accept that you might need some student loan debt to really lever your human capital, which at this point in your life can be worth several million. After that, pay the student loan debt first if the rate is higher than 5%. Then we can re evaluate in four years

Hey don't say I'm running out of replies, I can go all day if you want. You have a loop in your argument. The mining is high because of prices and the prices are high because of mining. You can't fail! Unfortunately, we all know that mining follows prices, and prices dont give one shit about mining. 
The SF argument is interesting but it fails. There are many currencies with better SF ratios, for example monero is PoW and has a higher SF now. But is has lower mining because its price is lower. People won't go mine it just because it has better SF. The SF model must break, and very soon, or otherwise bitcoin will be priced at near infinity in just a few decades.
The only part of the SF model that works now is that bitcoin is an antique and priced as such. But you don't need all those fancy charts to say "bitcoin is expensive because its an antique"

It's just a good clickbait headline. Very smart of the writer who likely got a lot more income with the sensationalist headline.

I ran a correlation of SP500 vs Bitcoin over the past 12 months and it was ~0. There are cases where correlations move towards 1 during tail events, so that could be present. I will say anecdotally, if stocks crash, my buy price for crypto would also lower. This should be true for everyone since stocks crashes increasing their crypto allocation relatively, so crypto would have to crash even further to hit the lower bound of their allocation targets.

Market cap that is
@_date: 2019-05-05 19:53:33
Yes but price changes are a random walk, whereas subsidy is declining. That means our expectation for 2 years from now should be that hash rate also declines because our prediction for price should be $5500. Fees need to replace $4.5 million per day two years from now or price must be $11000. This may be feasible now. But after several halvings it becomes less and less feasible

Good narrative but not accurate. There are many assets with 0% new supply. It doesn't mean anything
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:16:22
If you value the asset at $2T some time in the next 10 years you wouldn’t have been correct to sell at $20K

I found the argument that bitcoin was neutral and not launched by one person like altcoins to be the weakest I’ve heard. Nobody ever heard of satoshi nakamoto? Would the instinsic value of storing in your brain apply to literally every altcoins the shittiest of shitcoins? So it seems to me those arguments why bitcoin would win certainly reduce the space significantly but it doesn’t eliminate the value of altcoins. Further, who cares if a technology was launched by a known entity ? Once it’s out there it’s just as unstoppable

You can still mine monero profitably with those cards though. Plus if you happened to be a crypto millionaire having a mining operation is a good diversifier

Who did you side with? My entire identity as a human being depends on your answer.

Easy. Is it exceeding your max allocation to crypto as a percentage of your total wealth? If so sell some.

The alt/Btc ratio has been increasing since before the 2013 bubble, which means the majority of Btc life has been underperforming alts
@_date: 2019-05-10 01:40:12
Probably has a lot to do with 1) fidelity offering bitcoin only soon and 2) Binance deposits and withdrawals are down so people may sell risky alts for bitcoin, but not stablecoins because it’s a bull market with many fiat gateways to bitcoin still open
@_date: 2018-12-08 23:14:23
That doesn't change anything. The market for fake bitcoins is independent of the market for real bitcoins. People who are waiting for an ETF or whatever are not buying bitcoins today. Their demand does not exist in prices. There always exists an equilibrium between supply and demand for real bitcoins and real bitcoins will always have a non zero price if the network exists.

Altcoins are proof of stake in a decentralized currency called “crypto”. You make votes with money for what money should be, and if you are wrong you lose some or all of your stake. Choose wisely, bitcoin is one of those choices too.

I dunno who is buying bitcoin these days. Young college kids don’t care about crypto, they all are statists happily using Venmo and Apple Pay. Old people don’t like it either, they are happy with their SS and don’t know how to use technology. That just leaves people in the late 20s to early 40s. How can bitcoin expect to get to 400k without any real adoption outside of trading? Where are the merchants not using crap like cash app or some other insta sell service? The adoption we have is not the adoption we were supposed to get

I think it will have an impact but that it shouldn’t. I think most people buying bitcoin are clueless and don’t even know halvings even happen, which results in them not being priced in at all. Miners are generally not holders and I assume they sell their entire stash and will continue to do that forever. As a result bitcoin should approximately double every four years for the foreseeable future (19% expected annual return)

About $3.50
In 2004 Iran produced 5.1 percent of the world's total crude oil (3.9 million barrels (620,000 m3) per day), which generated revenues of US$25 billion to US$30 billion and was the country's primary source of foreign currency.

Perhaps lite coin will  provide evidence whether coins go up just because of halvings or if it’s something that is priced in. I’m skeptical that litecoin will go up any more than other coins but I hope I’m wrong (I don’t have any ltc)
