Actually none, people care more about the price and the bullish. Many just hope that ETF is one of the factors that bring back the crypto glorious days

Either that country ban bitcoin or put high tax.
In australia you have to pay GST + Tax when you sell your bitcoin/cryptocurrency
Additionally, your banks may quietly freeze your bank account from trading with crypto exchange.

BTC drop = Alts drop
BTC up = Alts drop
BTC Stable = Alts Up
BTC just need to park its ass somewhere (3k, 5k, 10k, 20k, 50k I dont care) and Alts will up

180kWH? Yeah right. I have 26 panels with 265watts for each panels in Australia (blue sky ,bright sunlight and no cloud at all during summers) and only produced 40-50kW a day Or average of 5000kWH. 
So i dont believe the crap that your 26 panels can produce 3x the amount of kWh of my panels. I dont see any commercial panel in the market has more than 1000watts per panel.
So this story is big BS, nice try though

What??? I am not hostile. I am spending my times to explain as I have solar panels installed and I am an electronic engineer,so I am used to this kind of units and calculations.
Jesus Christ, some people just can’t chill and listen to someone opinions/explanations.
@_date: 2018-07-22 06:45:56
Well in Australia that means is 4 panels. I dont see anyone sell 1 panel = 1000 Watts. Eah panel roughly about 250 watts to 300watts, depend on the brand and model of solar panels.
So the price of 4 panels is about 500-1000 dollar after Australian Government subsidy. Range of price depend on quality, grade and your supplier.

Bitcoins and family too many dramas
@_date: 2018-07-22 10:18:21
180,000 kWh to 15,000kWh is very big differences. Contradicting your first statement heavily. 
And there is no such thing in unit as annual 15,000 kWh(incorrect unit) or generating 15,000kWh(too high for residential). That is very high voltage, your house not power station. If you mean 15,000 kW unit per year, that is still acceptable. 
But it is consider average to low for 32 panels and 300watts/panel to produce that much only , probably due to the atmosphere in your area or quality of your panel.
We do not lose efficiency to the heat due to quality spec installed. All we care is the amount of sunlight radiated from the sun and amount of light reach the panel. So cloud blocking or dirty panel may effect the kWh.
For you, Maximum daily production will be as below: 10-20% of your total kWh
If you have 32 panels x 300watts/panel
That is about 10,560 watts in total
Due to many factors max daily production is
10,560 x 10-20% roughly 8,500 to 9,500 Wh

You shall not listen to the comments in reddit, be confidents with your first choices, most the comments in the reddit are junks. Keep your portfolios spreads. 3-5 cryptocurrencies and dont touch for weeks, months or years till you think is profit enough to pull out
