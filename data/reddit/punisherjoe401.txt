I just wanted to send some to my friend so they see what Bitcoin is all about and I didn’t want to send a lot. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:11:55
I love Bitcoin but it’s true long confirmations and high fees will kill bitcoin. I spent 5 dollars just to send 5 dollars. This is not cool.

Is it true that you can be mining BU but pretend to signal for core?? 
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:39:58
Well now the miners can manipulate the price by supporting either way. So support for segwit price go up and support for BU price go down.

Wow can't stop laughing. ������

Coin dance is a BU shill, Idk this is what bitnodes stats are and you can also verify your node on bitnodes. Maybe the 11% is worldwide and 3% in the USA.

Weak hands will never prosper even if they read these warnings. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:43:22
Miners love making money �� and high fees are great for miners. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 05:27:56
I am supporting SegWit with a node on my Home computer. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 18:01:43

Asshole BCH will be centralized because of the your dumb big blocks. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 21:23:46
I got banned lol �� I was rely mad at first and then quickly realized I was a fool. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:54:48
If everyone would just start buying maybe just maybe it will be true. So go out and buy up all the bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:08:37
ok got it lol ���� I was really pissed and didn’t want it to be true. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 17:52:39
I want a Tesla Model X white on white with satin black rims. ��
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:01:27
Yeah mines too �� I also kept buying all the way down but I’m still hodling strong but it does get stressful at times. Hopefully this bear �� goes away and bulls comes back.
