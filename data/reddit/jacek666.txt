it's called sarcasm.
they only way to find out how the coins were stolen is not to presume that bfx and bitgo had a good security. 
cloudflare is definitely a weak point here, because there must be thousands of people around the world who have access to their "cloud" - and that's yet before you include hackers.
when you enter your password at bitgo.com, see a secret QR code, or receive an API key which later allows you to remotely execute withdrawals - all this info goes **in a clear** through cloudflare. and even if some info isn't going through CF, being _inside_ CF allows you to modify the content of the scripts and steal any data you want. 
who and how would find that the application was altered inside cloudflare, yesterday or a week ago? 
@_date: 2016-08-18 17:12:22
they say "china", so I'd assume it would be more about some kind of MITM attack on the HTTPS connection, rather than replacing the file on the server.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:04:50
Well this topic suggests that the thief likely used bitgo API (controlled by the secret API key), to execute withdrawals.
How he'd get the key is obviously not known. But if he did not get it from bfx or bitgo servers, then the third option is that he got it from the cloud. And the last one is most likely, because I'd assume that CF has much more employees than both the other companies combined.

When you go to the hotel and something goes missing from your room, who is the main suspect? The staff of the hotel, of course.
It's always more likely that a _hacker_ works at a company that controls the infrastructure, because his job is much easier then - suddenly impossible becomes possible.
And because CF has much more employees than bitfinex and bitgo, statistically it is more likely that he works at CF. But he might just as well work in a data canter that CF uses, not really being a CF employee. Or he might be a cleaner in a data center; a self employed contractor, officially cleaning toilets. It can be anything, but I'd definitely look for someone who had access to the infrastructure involved.

the average fee has risen by ~20 spb and people became more cautious making transactions which they often don't really need (e.g. started withdrawing from mining pools less often).

It enables MITM attacks for people either working for that company or having access to their infrastructure.
How secret is a _secret API key_, that has been distribution over the entire CF infrastructure while being shown to the user on the bitgo's web interface?

But if it was a leak through CF, there is no way to prove it. Even if the thief works at CF, which is likely, the company would be insane trying to catch/expose him.
But it's the bitcoin wallets and exchanges that use CF who are insane. The entire SSL traffic is 100% unencrypted at the CF level and not only passive sniffing, but also MITM attacks are easy to conduct for anyone with an access to this service. And then it is almost impossible to expose the thief.
So again: How many more bitcoins need to be stolen, before the suckers finally learn to stay away form CloudFlare?

@_date: 2016-04-07 06:53:53


.. would be a bitcoin reset.
or rather it wouldn't - as a different PoW system would not have been bitcoin anymore, but just another worthless altcoin. whilst the original bitcoin chain would not be even bothered with it, still doing well and mining new bitcoins. and if anyone would decide to swap their valuable old fashion bitcoins to the new altcoin, based on a new PoW, just to prevent the old fashion miners from controlling the protocol of their virtual currency - that would be the most stupid thing to do.
you obviously don't understand where the value of bitcoins come from. it comes from the scarcity of the number that the miners have been, are and will be looking for - it does not come from some _nodes_ accepting some _consensus rules_. 
without the scare numbers your bitcoins are as good as hacked pay pal accounts - simply speaking: worthless.
@_date: 2016-04-05 06:15:27


@_date: 2016-04-07 05:08:25
there is no such thing as _everyone_.
bitcoin is a machine and the rules of its protocol are simple: the longest chain rules. 
and the longest chain is built by the miners - so they set the rules.
and it is the design, not an accident.
btw, it's so funny how people here think that miners have expertise to built a multi-million dollar enterprises, using state of the art technology solutions, but they would not be able to create their own implementation of bitcoin software, had they needed to.
apparently _everyone_ is living in a dream world.
reminds me one of the interviews when gavin andresen was asked about _what if he decided to change the bitcoin protocol_... his answer was: _I'd probably be fired_
apparently even this guy - the one calling himself the chief bitcoin scientist, is living in a dream world. because in reality (and we've seen it already), the only thing he (or any other developer) can change about bitcoin is his socks with a bitcoin logo on it.
@_date: 2016-04-07 07:19:33
It's the other way around. The value of the bitcoins haven't gone down to zero, because the highly decentralized mining infrastructure protecting it cannot be beaten by any forces that have tried, are trying and will be trying to destroy this currency.
The mining is the only thing that keeps the protocol secure and therefore the only thing that gives it value at the end of the day. 
It's been very clear ever since Satoshi published his whitepaper. But obviously, even still today, only few people get to understand it.
@_date: 2016-04-06 18:14:50
the blockchain is a super highway - it's the main road and it's great for fast long distance travels, bu it can only fit so many vehicles. natural way of managing the highway is using tolls for controlling the traffic and not allowing the jams to slow it down.
now, you still have a choice - you can pay a high toll and go on the highway alone, in your own car... or you can split the toll among manny people, e.g. by going on it in a bus.
simply increasing a block size is not making the road wider. it is just letting more cars into the old narrow one... so it would most likely end up in a disaster.

If they don't allow you to withdraw a certain amount of fiat, they should not have allowed you to sell so many bitcoins.
Had they allowed you to sell 500 BTC and then blocked the withdrawal - I think you are in a good position to sue them, especially after they'd refuse to refund your account with the original amount of the deposit.
They just cannot do that; charge you with a fee for trading at their platform, and later refusing you to withdraw the funds - I'm pretty sure it's illegal and the court case would rather be easy to win.

Whether I am for or against an increase of block size is irrelevant, just like Gavin's ventures are irrelevant in the matter.
Incentives is the only thing that matters, as they will be the driving force of further development of the protocol.
Miners' incentives will drive the the size of the blocks and thus the transaction fees, while the users' incentives will drive a possible development of side channels...
Gavin's incentives - these only drive a bullshit coming out of his mouth.

And the miners want only one thing: bitcoin to the moon!

You are putting a trust in SSL certificates, that are well known to be not quite secure. Who cares that it is more convenient, if it is less secure?
When someone looses a money because of a compromised SSL certificate combined with his own ignorance - are you willing to take the blame, because you had been a supporter of this technology? I don't think so. And that is why you should not advise people to use it.
Anyway, suit yourself. Myself I will stick to the already tested for years old fashion solutions; GnuPG's web of trust and bitcoin-otc profiles. The payment protocol is just one big piece of shit designed to create an illusion of a security. May I remind you that the very reason 0.9.1 had to be released was the payment protocol in 0.9.0 that was leaking wallet's private keys through the Hearn's _secured_ solution?
@_date: 2014-05-23 16:40:03
No - they are not following the law.
Had they been following a law, they would have cited a reference to the actual law that they are following. But there isn't any law (at least in EU), that would require a private corporation to ask a customer where he has his bitcoins from. That's why the only reference they can make to is their own silly "KYC".
The thing is that their KYC is not the law!
In fact, IMHO, they are breaking the law asking this kind of question. It isn't any of their business where their customers got their bitcoins from and they have no right whatsoever to ask this kind of question, especially after they had already sold these bitcoins to another customer, charging both the parties with the trading fee.
I mean, of course they can ask anything they want, but people would be stupid to answer this specific question, in these specific circumstances.
So myself, I would just answer: _none of your business where I got my bitcoins from. You should had asked this question before taking them from me. Now you bought them already, charged me with your trading fees and I demand to withdraw the fiat that I got for them and which essentially has became my property. You have no right to hold my property hostage. Send the fiat to my bank a/c or see you in court. Moreover, had you refused to withdraw my funds, I will seriously consider notifying a proper prosecutor about a possible crime of an embezzlement, which I believe this case would clearly meet the definition of._

Why can't you just understand that mining pools only provide a service for users spread all over the world?

Better think about the fact that the banks are broken and the biggest ponzi scheme in the earth's history (the fiat money, based on perpetuating debt) is about to collapse - it is inevitable.
And considering that we are living in an internet age, there is literally no other alternative except bitcoin for a new form of money to come. After this lesson is finished, nobody is going to trust any central authority anymore. And nobody is able send gold via internet. Bitcoin is just the only way to go - and it's nobody's decision to make, the laws of nature will make it happen.
So instead of telling people that they should not be selling bitcoins, I would rather tell them that they should not be buying fiat, since buying a toilet paper with your bitcoins seems like a much better investment these days.

People, please understand that the entire SSL protocol is one big piece of shit - it's not the first, nor the last security hole that someone did/will publish.
If you really care about your security, bear in mind one thing: the entire concept of the SSL and the centralized certificates - it is a total bullshit!
The only _security_ it guarantees you, is the one that whoever messed it all up in the first place did not manage to cover. And whatever he had covered - has a backdoor.
PGP - that's your security, used and proven unbreakable from 1990s.
SSL - it's just bullshit, for lames, that gets a new exploit published at least once a year. 
How many more years do you need to understand it?

I am kind of a hacker myself and trust me: it is much more likely that it was just someone inside, who did not need my password at all. If the passwords I choose were weak, I would have coins stolen from all over the places.
But if you don't believe and want an evidence - be my guest!
All you need to do is to create a fresh dropbox account with a username / password that you find secured enough. Then just upload there an unencrypted wallet.dat, with like 1 BTC in it - I dare you to do it! :)

Yeah, but note that nowhere in the world a bank has any interest in refusing anyone to take his money. :)
I know big banks are afraid of bitcoin and they try to fight it by discriminating its users, but that is why you need to find a bank that is getting advantage of this fact and taking over their customers.
I am sure also in Canada there are plenty of banks that don't care about bitcoin being a threat to the current financial status quo - ones that don't care about big politics, but only about a condition of their balance sheet. These are actually the only ones that are going to survive at the end. People who run banks might be always greedy, but they are certainly not always stupid :)
Remember: you have bitcoins and therefore: they need more you, than you need them! :)

I also got my bank account frozen for like a day, and they also stole some money from me, saying that they were just 'reversing payments' - like there even was such thing.
But then I opened an account in a different bank and sued that assholes, after they rejected my complaint not even providing any legal base for anything they have done. 
The case is ongoing, I'm going to win it - and in the meantime I keep trading at LB with the new bank - it's a great service, you shouldn't give up on it, just because a bank scared you - that's what they do. How do you think they make money? :)
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:47:52
No, I'm in Netherlands ING bank now - they seem ok, don't give a shit where my money comes from. I mean they must know it's from LB, since each incoming transfer has LB... In the description, but they know I do nothing illegal and if they disturb me,  I'll just go to another bank - along with my money.
All the bank care about after all is to have your money. After they kick you out, it's just a matter of time when they start to be a sorry. Just educate them that they don't want your bitcoin fortune to end up with the competition ;)

Backdoors are always in implementation.
The problem is that SSL protocol has been deliberately "designed" to be one big non-auditable and non-portable mess. And that made the reference implementation, OpenSSL, the only library that is used nowadays to handle this one big mess.
Had it been a simple protocol, there would be many different implementations of libraries that support it. But that would defeat the point of creating the mess in the first place.

That's also a possibility. It is very hard to get cash in Venezuela and whatever you keep in a bank is not really yours. That would also explain why they hate alternative cash, like bitcoins or foreign currencies.
However, during my stay in Venezuela I changed dollars many times, on the street and in shops and nobody seemed to care or feel threaten.
@_date: 2015-05-31 11:52:58
Yes, you are wrong. 
By design a bitcoin node looks at the longest branch of the blockchain and the longest branch will always be the one with the miners' majority. 
By design only miners (and nobody else) control this network. Users, merchants, developers, politicians - they have no saying in the Bitcoin protocol changes. Moreover this is a very important security feature, not a flaw of Bitcoin. There is no way to work around it. 
Only mining majority controls the protocol.
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:36:34
You're talking bullshit man.
GHash has no incentive whatsoever to attack bitcoin, because they profit in bitcoins. Why would they want to sabotage their own profits? Think! It doesn't hurt.
Moreover, even having 70% in practice they cannot do a shit. As soon as they would had even tried to conduct any attaack on the network, all the users of that pool would have immediately abandoned it.
Mining pools are not a problem, as long as the hashing power stays decentralized - you dont need Satoshi to figure that out yourself. Mining pool is just providing a service for the miner and each of these miners would immediately disconnect from the pool having even a shadow of a suspicion that the pool acts against his interest. And attacking the block chain is acting against the interest of all the miners - always.
So stop wailing, people. You are only embarrassing yourself, by advertising the lack of understating of what you are talking about. And on top of that I'm getting sick already of your GHash/50% whining.
If you see one day GHash attacking the chain, then feel free to come back to us with your posts. But now STFU, please. Or say something smart / original - at least once, for a change.

Of course you need "to register". You need to register, even if you move to a different city, inside the country of your origin. Everybody knows that.
But by registering you don't get a "Residence ID card" nor "the residence permit sticker" in your passport - WTF?
They just put in their records that you live at a new address, so they would know that from now on you get to pay taxes from there. It has nothing to do with any residence permits.

@_date: 2015-01-25 12:43:31
Not really to warn. I didn't loose any money there - they allowed me the last one-time withdrawal.
I just thought it would be interesting for people here to learn why the BTC price at hitBTC is slightly higher. Because they come with shitty excuses when you want to withdraw your fiat, so the early adopters are less likely to use this service, for selling their coins.
And besides it's quite funny, how they tell me that I have been living in the country illegally, for so many years; I bought a house here for a quarter million euro mortgage, opened several bank accounts, driven few of my own cars with a dutch registration, on a dutch driving license, worked for a dutch company, then registered my own private business, have been submitting my taxes in the dutch tax office, even ended up in jail once for _insulting a police officer_ - and all of this without anyone realizing that I was missing the so much needed residence permit :)
It's funny - I think its funny enough to be posted, though probably it was too long so people didn't have enough patience to get to the funny part.
@_date: 2015-01-27 14:30:28
Yeah, but from my experience, this specific exchange that you are talking about gives a shit about the law even less than the banks.
One day when you request a withdrawal, out of nowhere they just send you a list of strange, totally privacy violating, questions, like _where did you get the bitcoins from and how much more of them you have?_
And they tell you that they have put your $10k+ withdrawal on hold, until you make it all clear with them...
Asked about the law that they are following with these withdrawal holding practices, they just dismiss you saying _it's based on our KYC policy that is required by the law that we must follow - we ask these questions when your account reaches a certain trigger of the volume_
Then you ask them to refer you to any specific legislation (that they have built their KYC policy on), plus what is the volume that triggers the questions. And they answer you that they cannot say... because it's secret.
The bottom line: banks at least would never dared to tell you they just follow a law/regulation, but they won't refer you to any legislation, because it's secret :)
@_date: 2015-01-25 09:22:07
So enlighten me: why do you think don't they do an arbitrage on that exchange?
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:54:48
IMHO, the price is following the pattern from 2011 when it reached $30 for a moment. This caused lots of money being invested into mining facilities. And just like back then, today also each bitcoin that is being mined is immediately being sold to cover the operational costs - thus there is a pressure on the price.
This is going to last until either a next bitcoin _promotional event_ (like a bank holiday in Cuprus was) or until the mining reward halves... I think an event will come first, but even before it the price will see the bottom and start to slowly go back up - it's just hard to say whether we need to wait one or fifteen months for the bottom... But it is the same pattern repeating, for the same reasons - just a different bottom (200 instead of 2).
@_date: 2014-04-08 17:12:31
We would not. Whatever you think you are securing with SSL - it is just an illusion.
Better to be conscious that there is no security, than to be sorry after being unconscious about the fact that there wasn't any.
Still, PGP and (it's digital signatures and a well established web of trust) gives you quite a reliable technology to base any security on.
The only thing you need to do, in order to get advantage of it, is to not screw it up by begging a corrupt corporations to developed a _secured_ communication for your personal needs.
@_date: 2015-01-25 10:12:51
Yes, you are right - I can still deposit fiat, but cannot withdraw, because of a totally bogus reason.
If they came out with a stupid reason in my case, I would not be surprised if they give other kind of stupid reasons for other users, to disallow them withdrawing fiat.
Either way, the most obvious explanation why the BTC/EUR is more expensive at hitBTC, is that they make it hard to withdraw EUR. Which I'm sure they do, at least in my case.

Don't you think that had I needed a "permanent residency proof" to live where I have for almost 10 years already, I would be a one to learn it before you?

Bitcoin is totally immune to all the garbage that I was hoping to escape - exactly because it doesn't give a fuck about the politics; the community, the ethics or about what anyone wants. Which makes it a perfect form of money!
Had you hoped for Bitcoin coming down and freeing people from the oppression of greed and corruption that comes with the instrument of money - obviously you are going to be disappointed. Because the only way to get rid of greed is to get rid of the money - not to invent and embrace a more perfect form of it.
Bitcoin is evil, just as much as all the money is - it is going to corrupt people and make them fight wars for it.
It solves very important problems in the monetary system and is a huge invention in a field of economics.
But it is not going to free the mankind from greed and corruption that are eating our civilization, like a cancer - just deal with it!
The developers, the users and the lobbyists are just people - pawns in this game; conditioned by the system to make profit out of the money and they are going to behave exactly the way you should expect them to behave, if you understand the system.
In other words: stop wining as it sounds pathetic. Bitcoin isn't here to save the world - it's here just to replace the money we had known.

If you can see just look around and you will notice that it's been kind of proven by the nature that the existence of money inevitably creates greed, hate and competition (as the opposite to friendliness, love and cooperation). 
Money is the instrument that allows an entity to gather (and keep for itself) more wealth than it can carry - even more than it can spend for the rest of it's life. And that's the problem, as this is solely against the nature of a living beings. You cannot have something without taking it away from the environment. So in the world where you are able to have more than you can carry, this creates a very serious environmental issues - and that's the whole problem.
Things like fiat money or money creation tricks are just consequences of the existence of the money in the first place. These economical pathologies were in fact created by entities who had gathered too much money in the first place and then started using their wealth to change the rules.
If you want to get rid of people (or institutions) using their accumulated wealth to enslave all the other people, and destroying the environment, the ultimate solution is to get rid of the money itself. If you leave the money to be there, all the problems will quickly reinvent themselves. And the new 'tricks' will be even more outrageous than the current ones are - trust me.
People don't control money. Money control people!

I don't think you and me actually have the same understanding of what is the definition of _work_
Back in 2010 Satoshi left, leaving Gavin admin access to the github repo with the Bitcoin's client source code. Gavin, by this very day, calls himself to be Chief Bitcoin Scientist.
But what do the scientists do? They solve complex problems using a scientific approach.
Already in 2010 everyone knew the scalability was a very serious issue of that day's protocol. We all knew that when the Bitcoin grows bigger it wouldn't scale.
What has the 'Chief Scientist' been doing for the past ~5 years to solve the Bitcoin's most important issue?
Absolutely nothing!
He's just been waiting, promoting himself for a celebrity, having a backup plan for when the shit hits the fan: he's been proposing to modify a constant in a header file, to 'fix' a very complex problem.
Don't you idiots fucking think that if solving this problem was as easy as changing a constant in a source code, Satoshi would had done it himself? Instead of leaving solving it to a guy who he obviously misjudged as a competent engineer, but who in fact has turned out to be just an other politically driven whore.

Man, you are not the first one who has realized already that banks don't give much shit about following laws and regulations.
Yes, you can probably sue them and you would have probably won. But they know, you won't sue them for $15 and even if you did, it would take years to get your $15 back.
Though, if I was you, I'd have filed a complaint to my own bank and asked them to explain. I had such a situation once (receiving SEPA transfer of €100 from Greece, they deducted €5 as some mysterious fee). They answered that investigating of my complaint would be expensive, so what would I say if they just give me €5 instead? I said 'fine', they added €5 to my balance and we are even.

:) Give ma a break.
These gambling sites that base their business model on zero confirmation payments are there to be ripped off. Having a mining pool, I would have ripped them off myself because they are just asking for it. But it isn't acting against bitcoin; it is acting against stupidity of some reckless people.
Accepting zero confirmations payments is not safe - how many times do people have to prove it to you, before you learn? Users or entire mining pools exploiting this are not to blame here - it is just how bitcoin works.
51% attack is about something completely different than double-spending unconfirmed transactions. It is about wasting own users' hashing power on creating long forks, for an actual double spending (of deeply confirmed transactions).
Another malicious thing that a majority of the network could do would be to not include transactions at all - or to discard all the blocks mined by the competition.
All the cases I mentioned are very easy to be detected, and as soon as it had happened the mining pool's users would have quickly acted upon it - as simple as that.
Obviously none of you guys (whining about GHash) is a miner. Otherwise you would understand how easy it is for a miner to switch to different pool. And that is why the miners, not the pool operators, rule this network. So chill out man, don't panic and just trust the miners; I guarantee you that they will choose the right pools, because unlike you they spent a shit lot of money on their mining equipment and they want it to keep making profits.

Yes - this is exactly what I think. Only the miners have an unquestionable incentive to keep the value of bitcoin as high as possible - no developers, no merchants, no exchanges, no banks.

@_date: 2017-03-04 17:12:46
Do you understand that going against the mining majority you leave your 'main chain' 100% vulnerable to 50% attack? Meaning: any coins on this chain are practically useless as no sane person is going to accept a transaction that can be reversed with the already existing system in place.

Miners have been and will be looking after their own self interest, which is the profit from the mining.
Anyone expecting the miners to not be looking after their own self interest (but e.g. fulfilling wishes of some _community_ or a lobby of developers) is going to be surprised.
I am not a miner myself, not anymore, but I am a big supporter of this system, invented by Satoshi himself. I want the protocol to be controlled by the miners and I want the miners to be looking after their own self interest. Why? Because miners profit in BTC and I am a BTC holder.

the payment protocol is not a "community accepted standard".

Man, I'm sorry for you. 
I've been to Venezuela recently, I loved the country and the people,  but what the government is doing with the money is just insane. Whoever is responsible for this situation is hugely incompetent - no fucking way they know what they are doing. 
In Poland in early 90s we also had a huge inflation, just like Venezuela now. But there was always a bigger banknote on time and people didn't have to carry bags instead of wallets. 
I don't know what the Venezuelan government is thinking, but this is fucking insane what they allowed to happen.  
And now they are blaming money changes and bitcoin miners for the mess they created themselves by their own fucking incompetence. 
Even Cuba has much better monetary policy than Venezuela. Maybe Maduro should ask Castro for an advise? Because for what he's doing now, Chavez probably would have fired him himself :)

Yes, like ETC is. 
However ethereum is totally different from bitcoin because it's mining seems to be very centralized and basically controlled by the ethereum corporation.  
Bitcoin mining is highly distributed and no single entity controls majority of it. Which is a good thing!

The community is split much more than in two. 
I am on neither side (think both sides are wrong) and I'm sure there is plenty of people like me. Most of them think I'm also wrong, on top of it. :) 
But I'm confident that bitcoin doesn't care about this BU vs UASF propaganda war and it will be just fine, not giving a fuck about either of the two.

There is no my chain, or your chain - there is only the chain.

No it's not trivial. 
If it's trivial then show us how it's done. 
And testnet3 has longer chain because it's difficulty falls back to 1, each two hours or so. 
It's not a real block chain, as invented by Satoshi. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:56:02
Whatever you want to call it.
Since the blocks in the chain are timestamped and the protocol discards any blocks with timestamps more than 2 hours ahead, in practice the longest chain and the most worked chain are the same thing.

@_date: 2016-03-21 12:50:32
No, I think it wasn't like that.
Trendon Shavers had "customers" - people who were "borrowing" coins from him, giving him USD as collateral. 
At the moment he decided to close the business, these "customers" refused to return the borrowed coins and at the same time managed to freeze his bank account so he could not buy the coins with their money to pay back his debts.
if you want to know who got the 400k BTC from SR accounts, I'd strat looking into who Shavers' "customers" were. I am pretty sure they existed and they were actually the engineers and the only winners of the BS&amp;T scam.
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:25:23
Just think... People say that after SW is activated, LNs should come soon... LNs mean less demand for on-chain transactions, therefore lower fees. And lower fees mean less profit from the mining.
Not to mention that SW itself means bigger blocks, therefore more supply for on-chain transactions, which can also lead to lower profit from the fees.
The fees has been going up, the BTC price has been going up - the prospects for the mining future look well. Why would they want to change it, risking unknown? 
There is absolutely no evidence that if SW/LN get activated the BTC price will raise (just because of this) enough to compensate them the lose from the mining fees. Perhaps Litecoin will be a good testing field, if its miners decide to try the new tech.

it it absolutely understandable. the financial system is coming down - like every other ponzi scheme before it. 
they were hoping to ease down the pain of it by throwing further banking regulations on the people - capital controls, deposit confiscations, banning of cash, charging money transfers with a huge fees, you name it; any crazy idea to get your money - they had it on the agenda...
but then suddenly comes bitcoin - allowing people not only to store their cash outside the banking system, but also to transfer funds to any other entity on the earth within an hour, without a permission from anyone - this is their worst nightmare! it instantly ruined all their further potential business models.
they are not nervous - these are corporations, they have no feelings. but they understand the danger and hey are shitting their psychopathic pants, facing the doom brought by a weapon that they have absolutely no clue how to defend from.
the banking system is going down - these institutions are going to die. their only hope was that their death would destroy the economy but bitcoin is here to preserve the economy while making those dinosaurs totally obsolete.

The BU part od the pie says "do nothing" as well, because almost all of it signals 1MB max blok size.

@_date: 2017-03-17 17:22:56
It's not Soft Fork - don't believe that. It will split the chain if enforced without mining majority. 
BU at the other hand - I haven't seen a single technical thing on how they would cause a hard fork. They advocate for bigger blocks, but they have a voting mechanism in place and from what I've seen almost 100% of the miners who participate in their voting method say that they want 1MB blocks.

I like Kraken - it's definitely my favourite exchange.
Before I was using Bitstamp, but since they told me that in order to get back my money, I had to answer some weird KYC questions, because they were "just" following some "laws" which they couldn't disclose - I've been happily using Kraken ever since. Fuck Bitstamp and fuck their _secret laws_!
Anyway, at some point Kraken gave me some "free Kraken credits", which I still seem to have, so I basically pay zero trading fees for selling my BTC.
And my SEPA withdrawals always arrive within one working day - as fast as the banks work.
What else may a bitcoin early adopter want from an exchange? :)
Keep it like this, Kraken!
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:26:58
Sorry, I have just checked it.
Every single block (from the BU part, but minus Classic) says "/EB1/AD6/". Meaning all of them want to stay at 1MB block size.
So, it's actually:  27% segwit | 72% do nothing | 1% bigger blocks

Why do we even need the mining in the first place?
We should just ask the "more than 100 projects and businesses" to sign the bitcoin blocks with their private keys.
Imagine how much energy it would have saved... Perhaps we could even get some UASF support from Greenpeace? :)
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:04:29
It's not true. Almost all the miners, especially the ones that 'use' BU, signal max block size of 1MB.
Do your research before spreading FUD. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:33:58
I think you mean 6 blocks mined on top...
My guessing is that yes, this is the idea behind "AD6". 
But that would be assuming that:
* They are actually using BU, not just a core putting "/EB1/AD6/" string inside the coinbase TX (e.g. to get some dosh from Ver for _mining with his client_)
* This functionality in BU actually works. BU devs obviously could not have tested such a feature on the live system yet, while the quality of their development has not been very impressing so far.
These are both very big assumptions. I don't think anyone is going to bet 6 consecutive blocks on them, even seeing that over 50% of the miner indicate "/EB1/AD6/".

Oh, trust me you will see, if you ever happen to do your UASF without the mining majority. 
But I'm betting you won't, because UASF is a crazy idea that will never happen.  
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:18:25
No, they obviously don't know what's up, if their message doesn't even mention UASF.  
There is no real threat of BU changing the block size and forking the chain. They don't have the hashrate to push through with it. They haven't and they won't - not in a foreseeable future...
The only possible threat of a fork coming soon enough is UASF.   
@_date: 2017-03-05 21:38:03
 supported stealth addresses for quite awhile, but they got switched off in version 1.7.0, since there was no interest.
you can still use them with clients version pre 1.7.0 and the wallet (even the latest version) still allows spending to stealth addresses.
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:29:39
They are, but they just don't get it. 
They really believe that UASF is actually possible, that they can just change the block chain protocol without having mining majority :) 
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:07:30
Define 'support from the miners'. 
There is absolutely no way they or anyone else can get 51% mining to push block size increase. 
Miners don't want bigger blocks. 
      
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:17:13
I just want to say that your UASF is the most stupid bitcoin feature proposal since Mike Hearn's black/red/white-lists.

So just prove me wrong by deploying this anti-Chinese-miners feature.

Are you serious? 
If they have more hashing power, they can:
1. Send btc to the exchange. 
2. Sell it on this exchange. 
3. Withdraw fiat to a bank account. 
4. Reverse the transaction from point 1.
Do you see the problem?    For the exchange that doesn't respect the hashing majority... 
@_date: 2016-01-23 04:44:21

Yep. I remember his idea of adding 'redlists' - it was around 2012, when he was still officially working for Google. Almost everyone smashed his idea, but he kept insisting that it was a needed feature...
BTW, Andresen wasn't very much against the redlists feature either.

My guess is that Roger Ver has moved his funding from inflating transaction fees, to paying miners for blocks with "/EB1/AD6/" string inside the coinbase.
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:49:35
I'm not quite following this. 
The message says that there is a high risk of BU forking off the chain. 
It doesn't mention that it's actually the Core with its UASF idea that is trying to fork off the chain. 
Reading through reddit posts, I think the chance of the later happening is actually much bigger. 
If Core forks off the chain with their UASF, while the miners majority keeps mining by the old consensus rules (using old Core, BU, or whatever else) - what is their plan for such a likely scenario? 
@_date: 2017-03-04 21:26:02
So what is the exchange going to do when half of the deposits from the last 24 hours get reverted?

@_date: 2017-03-17 21:47:02
No. 
If exchanges have decided to support UASF then they need to state it clearly. 
In the meantime I'm only reading in their message that they are going to consider BTC what is following the old consensus rules. The thing is that for all I know BU is following the old consensus rules - it's segwit that needs new consensus rules and some people are threatening to split the chain just to have it activated on their branch. 
Still, it doesn't answer the question: what are these exchanges going to do if UASF comes into reality and causes a fork?
Why can't they just answer it? 
Which one they will call BTC and which one ABC? 
Mind that we're talking here about a fork that would have nothing to do with BU! It would be just: old (mining majority enforced) versus new (UASF enforced) consensus rules... 
Their message doesn't answer the most important question today, about the most likely fork to happen in a near future.      
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:15:47
Bitcoin was designed to resist any change that goes against the interest of the mining majority.

They just said that they will stick with the "chain that is the most popular amongst miners". It has nothing to do with any software version politics and is in fact the most reasonable thing to do.

The true about this poor pathetic man is that if he only could create a minority branch, he would have done it by now. But he can't!
Today nobody is taking him seriously anymore - not even the mainstream media, as even they have already realized that Gavin Andresen is just an attention seeking idiot, promoting himself for a celebrity by using fancy titles like Bitcoin Chief Scientist and talking loads of bullshit - and apparently that's all he can do.

@_date: 2017-03-07 12:25:42
I believe Gavin Andresen an some other folks once tried this and failed.
They wanted to introduce a hard fork and make it the bitcoin's main chain, just by convincing users, exchanges and merchants that the mining majority does not matter.
They were saying that after a specific day they'd just start mining bigger blocks, not minding that they have less that 50% of the network's hashing power.
And I was laughing at it back then as well.
So I wonder, why exactly do you think they filed, but you will succeed? Because your solution has a cooler name? :)

Isn't this exactly what all the other pools indicating a "support for BU" do as well?

I have a cheap laptop which I use as a cold storage wallet, to sing transactions offline. 
It might not me as portable and user friendly, but it is cheaper than any h/w wallet you can buy. Actually mine was free, as I had the laptop and wasn't using it.
I don't quite trust h/w wallets. On the laptop use my own software which I trust. Plus any data moved from (and to) this laptop goes through USB stick, so I have a full look into the communication. Which I would not be able to do on the USB connection between a PC and a h/w wallet.
@_date: 2017-01-25 23:45:25
Soft fork is superior to hard fork - sure.
But maybe miners don't want to increase the block size, by any kind of fork?

Your fee (0.0001 BTC) is too low, in relation to the size of the transaction (616 bytes).
It comes down to a fee of 16 SPB, which is definitely not enough to jump high enough into the current queue.
Either wait for god knows how long, or redo the transaction with a higher fee. I'd suggest at least 5 times higher...
Also, if you want to save a bit on the fees in the future, use a wallet that operates on compressed public keys.
@_date: 2016-11-24 09:31:09

.002BTC seems a bit excessive, unless your three transactions were unusually big.
Yo should educate yourself on how to control the fees manually, if you want to save some bucks on it - at the end of the day it is you who decides how large fee you want to pay. If you give too little, your transacion will take more time to confirm.

@_date: 2016-11-24 13:26:30
But compressed keys save you only 32 bytes per transaction's input. 
In this case, your transaction would be 520 (instead of 616) bytes big.
That would allow you to reduce the fee by about 15%, keeping the same confirmation time.

I don't have to tell - I'm not coming here to gloom on how great systems' developer I am.
But tell me please a name of a system that your idol Gavin Andresen has ever build - the one you admire him for building? You don't seriously think it's Bitcoin, do you? :)
He has not done shit for building Bitcoin. This guy would not have built Bitcoin, even had you stuck the Satoshi's paper right into his ass - it sounds like a joke, but it is just a funny reality. He's just a pathetic parasite, feeding on the Satoshi's invention. 
That's all I have to say about his ambitions of "building systems".
And yes, I have built systems so I know what I am talking about, though I don't give a fuck about you believing me.
@_date: 2015-08-25 07:31:37
Pools don't own the hashing power - their customers do. Switching to a different mining pool takes zero effort.
@_date: 2015-08-06 17:25:16
Perhaps you don't understand what **building** systems is about.
If I was to say that e.g. _I built a house_, I'd not be referring you to some 400+ remarks that I made to a design of the house made by all the other people. 
Gavin Andresen has not built Bitcoin, you morons!
He's a fucking politician with a funny beard and I would not have hired him to built an IT system, even for a minimal salary, as he's so lame in this.
@_date: 2015-08-10 07:06:25

The consensus relies solely on mining majority and doesn't give a fuck about your whining. 
You will shit yourself million times, before you manage to change the bitcoin protocol through crying on reddit about your pity life. 
You want to change the protocol, better start investing in mining equipment - that's what defines the consensus, that's the whole idea of the satoshi's invention. But you obviously still don't fucking get it - like a total moron who will burn himself dozens of times without realizing that fire is hot.
@_date: 2015-08-02 12:09:11
Who the fuck cares what Mike Hearn thinks?
@_date: 2015-08-07 07:09:54
Well, the man surely isn't Arnold Schwarzenegger, but what makes him a politician I meant is not the CV. It's the things he does. 
If you look at the recent Andresen's publications, they sound politically, not scientifically. If you look at his achievements, it's even worse. Let me remind you that after Satoshi left this man was supposed to drive the development forward. It was like 2 or 3 years period when he basically had a carte blanche and almost everyone had trusted him. That was exactly the time when a developer was supposed to build a system that would work for hundreds of thousands of people. But he was just sitting doing nothing - some pity features that nobody even cares to use, like the payment protocol. 
Now, after over 5 years of building the system, the only solution Andresen can come out with to build the system "for hundreds of millions of people" is... increasing the block size. Except that increasing the block size has nothing to do with building systems, while it has loads to do with convincing people that this is what they need.
It'd be quite tragic if it wasn't so funny.
@_date: 2015-07-31 17:01:16

It's amusing how different people like to use an argument of _"this is what Satoshi would have done, because that day he said..."_
I am quite sure that Satoshi would have never delegated Hearn to speak for him - so why won't Mike try to make some own arguments, instead of bringing an authority of a person who would likely despise him, had he still been around.
@_date: 2015-08-06 16:40:14
He said he was interested in building - so I would like to see him building something. I mean except some obvious cheap PR propaganda that's he's been so much involved with for the past couple of years.
@_date: 2015-07-29 14:50:03
No, they didn't fight. Satoshi was just ignoring Hearn - same as most of the people who despise him today.
And you know that Hearn was openly being paid by Google back then, don't you? And now he's still paid by some shady powers - no doubts about it. Most likely the same shady powers that also pull Andresen's strings.

You have some good point, but you are coming from the assumption that when segwit gets activated everybody will switch to segwit transaction.
You can't assume that and at the same time claim that miners use ASICBOOST to reduce cost of mining. 
If miners can save money by using ASICBOOST, then they will prefer to mine non-segwit transactions. And this would inevitably reduce fees for non-segwit txs, at the expense of increasing fees for segwit txs.
So why would any user switch to using segwit transactions if:
1) not all of the miners mine them 
2) they don't even have lower fees
@_date: 2017-04-01 11:09:02

@_date: 2017-04-06 02:16:40
Of course it's another effort to activate segwit. I wasn't born yesterday. You don't even need to read his post between the lines. 
Now, why the miners don't want to activate segwit and maybe because it'd make their mining more expensive - that's a different story and I don't disagree with it. It's actually a very good point. 
However, is it really such a bad thing? 
Because I could swear that like a week ago reddit was screaming that they don't activate segwit because they have a plan to destroy bitcoin. Whilst today they suddenly don't activate segwit because they are just greedy... So which one is it? And which one is worse? Because I'm kind of lost here. :)

What is interesting however, is that Gregory Maxwell is using big words like attack or exploit to justify the idea of what can only be called his original proposal of User Activated Fork - yet another try to activate segwit, not only by forking the chain, but (worst) doing it against the mining majority.

It's just another kind of an attack on the network. And another failed one as I think there is no way they will even mine a single 2mb block, wasting $10k for basically nothing.

But why should he? :=
@_date: 2016-02-10 05:24:55
I think they have a mechanism to minimize orphan blocks and this is a side effect of it. 
When the pool receives a new block from another miner (before it fully verify/process it), it already start mining a new block, on top of the received one.
Because they (the pool) always have a period when the previous block has not been processed yet by their system (which likely uses some kind of not very fast, distributed UTXO database), they don't know which txs they are allowed to include in the new one... But, they need to start mining a new block ASAP, to minimize loses. So within this 'new block committing' period they are mining an empty (or almost empty) block.

@_date: 2017-04-06 13:14:16
Correct me if I'm wrong, but AFAIK even with segwit activated the miners are still free to mine blocks without segwit transactions inside, thus not needing to include the wtxid commitment, thus still being able to use the 'attack'. 
So it's actually BS that they block segwit activation because of this reason.

@_date: 2017-04-06 01:35:00
I'm pretty sure I understand everything. 
The publication is saying that with segwit wtxid comments mandatory, it won't be possible to use that specific optimization. 
The publication calls the optimization an attack, or refers to it as 'exploiting a vounrebity in the POW function' 
The publication proposes User Activated Fork, at the fixed block height, to solve the problem. 
Now, which part do I not understand?

Just an observation.
I don't remember people putting much attention at the previous halving. Except of the miners :)
@_date: 2012-06-08 18:58:03
two things come to my mind:
1) use a buitcoin build which does not enforce a transaction fee (you can find some mods on the bitcoin forum), set the fee to 0.01 and I'm sure some miner will mine it out pretty soon, despite of the size.
2) export the private key of this "1CdSE..." (RCP command "dumpprivkey"), then import this private key into mtgox (funding-options/add-funds/redeem-private-key), wait for 6 confirmations - and then you can sell the coins at mtgox, or just send them out from there.
@_date: 2016-09-28 17:38:13
I guess if someone would design a compression specifically for bitcoin blockchain, you could achieve significantly better numbers.
But I doubt in 3:1 - the signatures, hashes and the keys (which occupy the majority of the blocks' data) are _designed_ to have maximum entropy. And maximum entropy means zero compression.
Where you can compress with a designated algo would be a repeating transaction id's and and re-used public keys.

I'd like to see how it performs doing the Full Blockchain Validation. I'm quite sceptical on the promises...
IMHO, at this moment the most advanced, alternative full-node implementation of the bitcoin node is gocoin.
It's been maintained for years already and it's always up to date with the latest protocol changes. for instance the recent version 1.7.2 has support for Compact Block Relay (BIP-152)
@_date: 2016-09-15 13:28:38
just one remark.
if the private key is stored on the device, there is always a way to extract it. the only question is: how much would it cost.
@_date: 2016-09-28 16:34:26

I never said there was such a thing.
There isn't such a thing - but there can be, if someone makes it.
And I'd see it more as client (blocks DB engine) specific, rather than any extensions to the blockchain protocol.
We were talking about compressing the blockchain on the disk and a compression method that would be optimal for it.

Two possible reasons:
1. They want to feel important by "improving" Bitcoin by making a change that does not require any technical skills, since they have not technical skills to offer.
2. They want to destroy Bitcoin's P2P nature, by making running of the nodes (and thus the Bitcoin network itself) much more expensive than it is now. And it is already quite expensive.

I think you confuse compression with weather forecasting :)
Compression is about statistical analysis of existing data, not predicting anything.
You can make a global index of repeatedly used values of hashes and public keys and put a short reference whether they occur in a block.

@_date: 2017-10-04 14:47:37
They are not to decide which protocol changes are wanted and which are unwanted.
This is miners' job.
The fact that they are thinking that they have a power to decide on block chain protocol changes - it only shows how incompetent they are. 
Not to mention how they screwed up even that - instead of sorting btc1 nodes out, they only forced them to stop introducing themselves. And now, playing their own game, btc1 nodes are implementing "features" that are meant to abuse core node's resources. One had to be a real idiot to imagine that it could have ended otherwise.
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:13:13
We will see how it develops.
96% of the recently mined blocks has "/NYA/" tag inside the coinbase. If the split and the post fork hashrate distribution end up with such proportions, your bitcoin core project is doomed. And the "reply protection" bloating the core's UTXO set would be just the final nail to your the coffin.
I guess that's what scares you :)

Maybe it's "strumming along", but I have already got rid of all my BCH. Haven't you?
You do understand how Bitcoin and mining works, but you seem to be quite clueless as for where the value of bitcoin comes from.
You seriously seem to be thinking that it comes from the army of the idiots who post in this sub. And you think that the more idiots you convert to your side, he more valuable your post fork branch would be.
Well, smart people look at the hashing power distribution, not at your propaganda.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:15:58
That's not true. Nobody had said that UASF would never be implemented. We were only saying that it won't work, if the majority of the hashing power won't follow it.
You must admit that it's quite interesting, that today 96% of the hashing power keeps claiming that they will follow the segwit2x road map. Perhaps they are bluffing, but we can't say for sure, can we?
FWIW, I also hope hey won't do it, because I really see no need for that.
But if they do - if they take 90+% of the hashing power into the other branch, then there is no way I'd keep the coins backed by a minority of the hashing power, even if Satoshi himself came public and backed up the core branch.
Whether I's keep the other ones - that I can't say now :)
Nevertheless I think they are bluffing :)

there is no economical or practical reason to further increase the block size ATM - the reasons are purely political; it comes down to the power play on who is going to be the bitcoin's ruling elite of the future :)
nevertheless it was the core and their "feature" to disconnect btc1 nodes, that started the war on software "upgrades" that are nothing but attacks aimed solely on the other implementation. this "replay protection" is a designed attack and is quite right about it.

Bitcoin has had competing implementations for years, but the majority of people is too lazy to even find out about them.
But I guarantee you that each of the big mining pools uses its own implementation of the node, as they cannot afford loosing money by waiting for the devs to tune the reference code according to their needs.

The two addresses you gave only have 76 unspent outputs, with 0.09431529 BTC
Using average fee from the last day, you can combine it into one output for about 5% of the value.
Spending only 1% for the fee should also work fine, just will take more time.
Gocoin would have no problem with it: 
EDIT: 
Sorry - I've only counted inputs with at least 0.001 BTC.
You can recover these ones for the cost given.
As for the remaining outputs, with less than 0.001 BTC - the fee will go up, up to the point where some inputs would cost more to recover than they carry.
To recover all coins with at least 0.00001 BTC, for a fee of 6 satoshi/byte, you'd need to sacrifice ~1.4% 
- 
Note that using a higher fee factor (than 6 SPB) would not be profitable at 0.00001 BTC, since each input adds about 150 bytes to the transaction.

You would need to use a wallet that supports it. Gocoin wallet would be an example of the one I know.
The majority of nodes (miners) will not let you to replace a transaction unless it was marked as a possible RBF. That has to do with the value of "sequence" filed(s) inside the transaction to be replaced.  That is the main reason why Bitcoin Core cannot be used for it (otherwise you could just try to delete the tx and make a new one).

Banning Bitcoin is this or other country is also not a good idea, but such kind of topics do not get ~80% down-voting.
You down-voted the topic because you don't want reddit to promote the idea that there are other means of addressing low fees micro-payments, than centralizing mining industry by lifting the block size limit. 
Whether you are a minion, or maybe you just have a self interest in promoting a centralization of bitcoin nodes - this we can eventually discuss, if you want.
@_date: 2015-10-24 14:04:40
I agree with you, but I also think that there is no reason to worry about government tempering with the bitcoin protocol.
Satoshi left because he was already confident that the self interest of the miners had became powerful enough to take over any further protocol changes in Bitcoin. And they have. Developers no longer control the protocol, whilst governments were never even close to it, as Bitcoin was designed to resist central planers and the design has proven to be working.
Whether we like it or not, we live in the world ruled by money. These days the governments are being controlled by money, not the other way around. And bitcoin is the most perfect from of money known to man.
IMHO, it is just a matter of time before we see bitcoin overthrowing governments.
Also you should note that only because other bitcoin developers cease to openly express their political views doesn't mean that gmaxwell is the only active developer not corrupt by the central planers. Trust me - the most active ones are those whose names you probably haven't even heard. At the other hand those who make a lot of noise - these are not even developers anymore. Andressen himself haven't develop a shit for a few years already. But crazy kids and central planers like to use him along with the label _Chief Bitcoin Scientist_. Whilst for me, the man would have been a scientist only if propaganda was a domain of science and scientific publications were staring from a title _Debunking myths about..._ These days this is his favorite way of expressing "science":

You just came with your own (or someone's else) claim, stating that side-channels do not solve the scalability issues. Moreover, to support this claim you are calling an authority of the people whose authority you had rejected before even coming into this topic to disagree with me.
Personally, I totally disagree with the claim that side-channels are not a solution for the bitcoin scalability issue. 
I believe that side-channels are the most obvious way to actually address the scalability issue. And this statement is based on my personal experience/expertise, not on what I heard someone once said, what was his name and who he was working for at that moment...

You're talking like there was some kind of an apocalypse that I missed, while in fact GHash.io pool has done zero harm to Bitcoin while having the 51%.
The miners had nothing to protect, as their interests were not endangered. 
And I never have said it would not happen for a single pool to have 50+%
I could however have said that had a mining pool tried to exploit such an advantage, in any way that causes the bitcoin price to go down - this would have been its last day on the market, as all the miners would have immediately turned against such a pool.
Could a pool, at the other hand, case the bitcoin price to go up while _exploiting_ the 50+% advantage (most likely by changing the blockchain protocol) - their network share would have quickly grown even more.
Guarding the protocol by the miners is all about self interest. 
The strength of the bitcoin protocol is not based on ethics, but solely on greed. 
And that is why Bitcoin is still here - stronger than ever.
Because (sadly) we're living in the world where greed is always stronger than ethics.
Therefore we can rely on a security of this system :)

Unlike Bitstamp, Kraken doesn't ask you where you got your bitcoins from, when you try to withdraw fiat.
@_date: 2015-10-25 10:53:17
I don't see a problem here.
Pools are just services for miners. Miners using them can switch to a different pool instantly and at zero cost, if they only see the pool acting against their interest. 
See how quickly GHash went from ~50% of the network's hashrate to basically zero these days.
So it's still the miners, not the pools, that control the protocol. And the miners are going to work in their self interest, which is keeping a high value of the currency. Which is also an interest of anyone holding bitcoins.

If you haven't down-voted this topic, then why have you said that I called you the Hearn's minion?
I'm not assuming that every down-vote is a result of the block size debate, but there is always a reason why people down-vote certain topics. 
And in my opinion, expressed in my initial comment, this topic has been down-voted by the increase-max-block-size lobby (aka Hearn's and Andresen's minions), which (undoubtly for me) are quite active at this sub-reddit.

Nope. Satoshi built it in the fist place.
Mind my friend that even since he left the project Bitcoin has not really changed - it's the same protocol, only different looking client.
Now it's just different influence groups trying to drive the project in the direction of their own interests.
But Satoshi was a genius who made it in the first place. And he made it in the way that the _groups of people_ cannot break it now, no matter how hard they try and how strongly they are corrupt.
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:24:54
Miners have a power to reject any blocks they want.
You can tend to move to bigger-blocks-fork, but the main rule of bitcoin protocol is that the _longest_ chain always wins.
You guys are debating a topic that makes totally no sense.
Do you really think that the miners are going to care what DeathAndTaxes, Peter Todd or Gavin Andresen think about the block size limit, before making their own decision?
Well, let me enlighten you: the only people I know who give a shit about what these people think, are you - nobody else. Which makes you just pathetic. :)

What I am saying is that if they are launching the platform, there should be a big sell order (set by the service owners, amounting to how much yet unallocated bullion they have in the vault). And from this order the new people should be able to buy the gold with their freshly deposited bitcoins.
And that wall should be set at the current price of gold. And the current worldwide price of gold is called the spot price, AFAIK.
Instead, what I see in their system is a sell order that is 10 grams big... And if you want to buy more, you need to pay much more than the gold is actually worth ATM. And that is not quite fair, IMHO.
@_date: 2015-02-13 23:50:04
So who is selling this gold to "the market" in the first place?
I'd like to buy some at the actual gold price, but it seems that there are not enough sellers...
You guys charge 0.5% as the transaction fee, plus (for what I see) another 0.5% for BTC/USD change... and then you sell the gold at a higher price than any spot price I can spot...
That is not quite fair, is it?
@_date: 2016-10-20 09:33:24
But RFB spec says that max-nSequence transactions are not supposed to be "replaceable".
So your observation rather confirm that the nodes suport RBF these days.
Mine too, BTW, as I'm getting regular replacements for txs inside my memory pool. So the nodes I'm connected to must support RBF.
@_date: 2016-05-30 12:53:44
Then you need to tell them how did you earn your money and what you are going to do with the bitcoins after buying them. Plus, what is your occupation, how much you make per year and when was the last time you had sex, with or without your wife. 
The list is actually 10 weird questions long, but it should not surprise you as they are only obeying a _law_ asking them to you. Although they cannot tell you which law, because it's secret.
@_date: 2015-10-13 13:11:48
It's funny how this topic is only 86% up-voted as this is actually a pretty great news; a solution that addresses not only the bitcoin scalability issue lowering down transaction fees and allowing more of them, but eventually also improving a time of confirming a transaction.
The Hearn's minions lead by Andresen himself must be really pissed of now. :)
@_date: 2015-02-13 21:59:54
Sure guys, down-vote me all you won't - be my guests! :)
It won't though change the fact that had Satoshi worked with others, Bitcoin would have never been born.
The successful anti established projects have never been build by groups of people and down-voting the truth won't change this fact.

Is there anyone who takes you seriously, including all the 12y olds on reddit?
The 1MB block size limit is going to stay for long, no matter how each and any single one of you are going to shit themselves trying to change it. None of you has power to change it - only the miners have the power and they will use it carefully, minding their own interest. Just deal with it.

just because some people added one feature does not make them the inventors of bitcoin. it they had not added P2SH, bitcoin would still be here and it would be just fine. moreover: multisg transactions would still be possible, only the addresses would be longer. 
bitcoin was solely invented and put into existence by satoshi - not by a group of anarchists! and that is what makes the difference - that's is why open bazaar project has been failing; because it does not have the single guy who would just drive it.
or let me put it otherwise. why won't you sir enlighten me with your wisdom, answering the OP: why do you think open bazaar hasn't launched, despite of so many people spending so much time on its development?

why does it require more time to be done, despite the amount of people working on the project?
let me remind you that these people had said themselves that the fist working version would be ready by december 2014 - nobody had forced them to make such a commitment. yet they did it, and failed to deliver.
project management is indeed an issue - or rather a lack of it... which was my only point: that's what happens when a group of anarchists starts to work together on an IT project!
and I mean no disrespect to anyone - that's just how it is and it's nobody's fault. though I find it quite amusing how they vote me down, hating what I'm saying. :)

Sorry, I am not from US - can some please explain me something here.
Where I live, the country has three types of institutions: legislature, judiciary and executive (government). All the three types of power are fully independent and it would be solely against the constitution if one gets into the other's shoes.
As far as I am concerned FinCEN is an executive institution and they cannot make laws, nor judgement. And if this is true, why do you even care what they think? Their interpretation of the existing laws is as valid, as anyone's else.
In a democratic country only judiciary institutions can make an actual final ruling and it bases on the law that can be changed only by the legislature institutions - government has no saying here, so why do you care so much about what they think?

Well, then now I fully understand your initial comment. It apparently wasn't as much stupid, as sneaky.
But you know, where I live, smuggling ads through comments is called "spam" and people generally don't like it. Not to mention that it is just dishonest. But I actually heard that most lawyers and bankers are dishonest, so it all makes even more sense now.
And BTW, even though my school was not about a law, I would rather represent myself in a court, than hire an expert as _sophisticated_ as you. If someone like you has managed to become a _legal expert_, then obviously anyone can do it. So I bet that I would have won alone, without a lawyer, against the bank. Not that it would have been my fist time.
So thanks man, but people don't really need your sophisticated knowledge - just trust me! Though I am almost sure that you can use it now to demand a refund from your school, since they charged you for teaching a law, while apparently they taught you mostly how to spam reddit with stupid comments and discourage people from fighting for their rights without a need of paying fat fees to social patricides like you.

If you don't pay cash, but via a wire, it is normal, because there have been cases when money was transferred from a hacked bank a/c and then the sellers went into problems. Some of them got the payment 'reversed' and are now now busy suing their own banks to get it back. Others just gave it up, booked the lose, but now are much more careful about buyers with no history.
I would be an example of such a seller and I also asked a fresh buyer for his photo ID once - because of the reason. No evil intentions whatsoever, but just to avoid a need for suing my bank again, since it isn't really that funny.
When you show your ID to the seller, along with a bank card - he can be much more certain that the account he's received a money from has not been hacked.  But if you feel uncomfortable with it, you don't need to do it - find a different seller. At the other hand, by making a wire from your bank a/c, this will give him your name anyway.

The "bitcoin payment protocol" is the biggest waste of time and development efforts that I could think of.
Only crazy or unconscious people are going to submit their personal details (like phone number or home address) to StartSSL just to get a *free* certificate, though at the price of having their data logged directly into Mossad's database. And submitting it to a different CA, then paying like $30 for it, does not make it anyhow better for the poor user who just needs to receive a bitcoin from another user.
PGP and its digital signature (that is totally suitable for protecting a validity of a bitcoin address) was invented in the 20th century. The core bitcoin dev team reinventing the wheel 20 year later... I cannot even find a right word to describe it, but the most gentle coming to my mind is: **disappointment**.

Yes - I completely agree with you.
You can authenticate your messages with a private bitcoin address, instead of a private PGP key and it will work just as well.
Which makes it even stranger why the core bitcoin dev tram is pushing the community towards using the non-anonymous, centralized and government dependent solutions.

Oh, trust me, I am the first one who says: fuck the police! I know exactly how they can abuse their power, but I also know that the German police is not that bad, comparing to other counties. 
Still - they are usually uneducated low income workers, so don't have too big expectations towards them. Obviously if you let them scare you by showing how unaware of your rights you are, they will tend to abuse their power even more.
And this is exactly why I keep repeating: everyone is innocent until proven otherwise - burn this sentence into your head! And proven you guilty can only be done in a court. 
Why do you think they unblocked the guy's bank account?
Only because they realized that blocking it in the first place was unlawful.
You cannot seriously think that it was an act of a mercy? :)
Guys, learn your rights - that is in your own interest!
But the sad part is that instead of learning your rights, I see you prefer to be scared and even get to attack a guy who is trying to teach you your rights.

Maybe for you Mike Hearn is a god, but for me he is a guy who works for the very same corporation that built in the backdoor into the Android's random number generator - the very same backdoor that was discovered recently by the bitcoin community after some money got stolen. If we did not discover it, the backdoor would have still been there.
Bitcoin is the money of the people, created by an anonymous scientist (not by corporations like Google), to be an electronic cash with the focus on providing **anonymity** and **decentralization**.
SSL at the other hand is the opposite of anonymity and decentralization - you cannot get a certificate without logging your personal data at some certificate issuing authority. And we all know that each of these authorities is in a close relations with governments.
This payment system that they are introducing and promoting so much goes solely against the recipient's privacy and against decentralization. I did read Mike's propaganda promoting this feature, and it is just full of BS. For instance, not to look far: he literally stated that this system *increases privacy*. Hell, from what I remember (the forum is still down) he even mentioned something about this feature being useful for *SR vendors* - how ridiculous is that?
Do you think people are stupid? Well, some of them obviously are, but I would not count on too many people using this stupid and dangerous feature, if I were you.
@_date: 2013-10-16 21:27:25
Tell them that they have no right to take your money without your consent, and if they do so, you will sue them.
If they claim that they have a  right to do so - demand them to quote the actual law (legal basis) that allows them to do so. But there isn't any so they wont find it.
And if they will still take your money, make sure to sue them! Otherwise they will never learn.
@_date: 2013-01-16 14:51:31
well in such case report it to their customer support - that's all I can advise you.
unless you were withdrawing to an mtgox address?
because in such case transactions do not appear in the bitcoin's blockchain, so it would be expected to not see it in the chain. though then the money should arrive to the destination a/c immediately.
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:10:51
Again: you are an idiot.
I'm pretty sure you mean "invalid" by your definition,.
In Bitcoin, whether a block is valid or invalid is defined by the consensus rules.
And the consensus rules are guarded (and therefore defined) by the miners - not by you.

But keep hoping - if it makes you feel better... :)
@_date: 2013-10-06 15:43:34
CERTIFICATE - we are talking semantics here.
Let's stick to the point. What this new great "payment system" is doing, is being able to connect some virtual identity (e.g. an email address) with a private key that authenticates it's messages, so they could be trusted by the recipient.
What they are proposing is a bunch of central authorities that will be doing it for us, so we supposedly will not need to worry about: *Does this private key indeed belong to this email address?*  And then our bitcoin client will conclude (for our convenience): *Yes, it does, because StartSSL says so!*
Well, thank you very much sir, but my brain is working well and I do not need a third party to establish a connection with my trade partner, just to receive his actual private key. I am totally capable to do it myself. And if I need his ID, I will ask him for it - I have no need whatsoever to involve Mossad in this process.
@_date: 2013-10-06 17:14:42


Yeah. Sorry about that - I know it isn't quite fair, but people ought to be cautious with who they trust.  It is a well known fact that Mike Hearn gets salary from Google and I believe we are all smart enough to figure that Google (or any other corporation) does not pay people for promoting interests other than their own.
So it's more of a *guilt by a motive* :)
Additionally for me it's also quite visible that Mike has put a lot of effort to promote this new payment system that is allegedly meant to be turned into a decentralized anonymous web-of-trust whatever, but all we know now for sure is that it will be centralized, non-anonymous and authority based. 
I don't buy a cat in a bag and nor should anyone else - that's what we say where I come from :)

@_date: 2013-10-16 18:04:30
It's a baseless theory.
There is no law that would allow a bank to reverse a wired money. They can do it with credit card payments, but not with wires. It's totally illegal.
If you state otherwise, then please quote the law that allows a bank to reverse a wire - otherwise you are just doing empty talking and misleading people.
I have been there and I know already that there is no such law, therefore they have no right to do this and if you allow them to steal your money, under such a silly pretext, then you are just a one big sucker.
@_date: 2013-10-16 20:16:10
Because that is their job. They have regulations that any transaction above a certain volume must be checked - thus they check it.
Obviously it is tax related.

But I don't really understand your question.
How does a fake ID would allow anyone to log into my bank account?
I have my own password and my own RSA security device - they have nothing to do with any certificate, do they? 
So I still don't understand the logic behind a need to provide my stool sample to a CA, in order to receive a bitcoin payment :)
@_date: 2013-10-15 18:51:46
First, I never used a phrase "control money" - only "create money" to "control people".
Second, in other words, you admit that:
* federal reserve creates the money, by buying bonds
* banks create more money, on top of that, giving loans
But what you fail to admit is that both; federal reserve and the banks put a pressure on the government to kill bitcoin. And why do they do it? Because it is a big thread to this 100 years old _status quo_ of the money creation monopoly.
I'm just saying...
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:48:40
Because StartSSL - the only provider of the *free* SSL certificates is based in Israel, and Mossad is their equivalent of the american NSA. But if you prefer, I can start using the word NSA, in place of Mossad, from now on - for me it is all the same shit, anyway :)
@_date: 2013-12-28 14:17:51


Right. That would explain why US government gets to execute people with drones, all over the world, without even bothering to get a court sentence or something.
But just out of a curiosity: it must suck to live in a totalitarian state like this, does't it?
I mean, if your own government has a right to kill you without a trial - that's far worse than China... hell, probably even worse than North Korea, isn't it?
After all it makes me wonder even more about the organization of the american democracy. If your government has a power to make a law and to make judgments, then: what are your the parliaments and the courts for?

Even if there is no source to support it, there is definitely an incentive for MtGox to act like this; withholding fiat withdrawals to pup up the price, and then start buying coins on other exchanges while selling them on their own with 5+% profit. After a month or two, they can just re-start processing of the withdrawals, saying 'sorry' like nothing ever happened, though being so much richer at that point already.
And who is going to prove them any wrongdoing?
It would also explains a high volume, despite of the fact that they have not been an actual exchange, for far over a month already, but only a service that sells bitcoins, at a price 5-10% higher from the market.

Because whoever controls the money creation controls the country - it's actually a quote from one of the US founding fathers.
Currently the banksters control the money creation, thus the country.
Bitcoin, as a money created by the people, is a huge threat to this status quo - this is the very reason why "US Government Feel Threatened By Bitcoins".
But you should keep in mind that it is not a real democratic government - it is just a puppet government setup by the banksters. Not only in US - it's all around the world.
And they will all fail, as Bitcoin will prevail.

Just send your 10 BTC directly to CIA and they will eventually end up in the same place, as if you would have sent them to Wikimedia Foundation.
And in case if you did not know how to send your bitcoins to CIA:
Buy some Afghan heroine on SR and just throw it out upon the arrival. :)
Don't try it, though - it's very addictive.

Whether something has been stolen or not is not up to a bank to decide. 
I don't know where you live, man, but in civilized countries we have courts for that.
Moreover, it is illegal for a bank to wire any money that comes from an illegal source. 
As well as it is illegal for the receiving bank to book a stolen money on their customer's account.
But it isn't even technically possible, since when doing a transfer banks move their own money on behalf of a customer. And the money that belongs to the bank cannot be a "stolen property".
Don't be stupid - know your rights!
@_date: 2013-12-26 10:27:19
If course you did say a lot about that.
You said that one has to not only be familiar with a law (including "nation's banking regulations" and "international banking law"), but he himself needs to be a lawyer - otherwise he should "refrain from claiming..."
If you don't want to say certain things, they just don't say them, instead of blaming people for pointing out what you wanted to say. And what you wanted to say is pretty obvious - it is literally: if you are not a lawyer familiar with all the possible banking laws, do not sue your bank, no matter what.
Again: he most stupid comment I have ever read on reddit.

He is to blame? No - I never said it.
I'm just saying that he is incompetent and if I get to use a Bitcoin software I'd prefer it to be made by someone who had not been beaten by NSA in a past.

I believe I already expressed myself clear enough: no design is better than this design, since this design is moving bitcoin backward, by promoting centralization and wasting dev resources on useless features that nobody needs. You have been busy with implementing this "protocol" for like last 6 months already and it will probably take you like another 6 to polish it up... but who needs it anyway? From what I see, only the people who you have managed to convince that they need it...
If you'd really want to do something useful for a bitcoin community, I can give you a number of things that needs improvement and people are eager to see - but none of which you would obviously find more important than "the payment protocol". 
And are we really supposed to believe that Google pays your salary, while giving you a card blanche to do whatever you want? C'mon man :)
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:26:29
What I don't understand? Trust me, my friend, I understand much more than you.
For a starter, I understand that a system which Mike Hearn once developed for Google has been exploited by NSA.
I also understand that NSA is, and will always be, one of the Bitcoin's biggest enemies. And that is exactly why only crazy people like you can trust such an _expert_ to build the security of Bitcoin.
And what I understand most of all, is that your hero Mike, after NSA had kicked hiss ass badly proving that he doesn't know shit about designing security solutions, instead of saying _mea culpa_, Mike says _fuck NSA!_ - and this seems to be a great way to impress you...
Ehhh, you poor stupid american slaves. :)

The guys are just admitting that they are some total lames who designed a _secured_ replication systems that even lame underpaid (everyone says Google pays best) NSA employees have managed to break... and you call him "one of Bitcoin's best assets"...
Shouldn't we hope for _Bitcoin's best assets_ to design an NSA resistant software, instead of just saying "fuck, they were smarter than us"? :)

I know what you mean. I actually have a similar feelings about "my government". If it was up to me, they would all have been in jail now, for getting themselves corrupt by an international cartel of a financial institutions. But the public prosecutor refuses to investigate the case... :)
Still, I think it is important to educate people that there are things like _human right_ and the three types of power, none of which has (should not have) a competence to enter the other power's domain - at least in a democratic country of law, which our governments claim that we all live in.
Unfortunately, as it turns out, it seems that these days there is a fourth power on top of the good old three: the corporations. But the only way we can get things back to normal is by fighting this corruption - there is no way for it to go away with us staying nice and polite towards it.

I suppose they can, if you don't have any contract with them for running your account... I'm surprised though that they let you to open an account without a contract.
Where I live, ISP cannot block your access to websites of their choice, phone companies cannot block a phone calls to number that you did not request to be blocked and banks cannot block wires to your account, just because of some bogus reasons. When they do, I first complain and if they don't fix it, then I sue the bastards - that is my civil duty and it should be a civil duty of everyone here. How otherwise will they learn?

Let me guess: you received a _fraudulent transfer_ from Postbank and so later they demanded your bank to _reverse it_? Oh, you are among many, sir :)
But demand your money back. Banks have no right to reverse transfers. Technically they can do it, but legally they cannot - it's stealing.
If they don't give you back your money, sue them. Trust me - the law is on your side here.
Don't let them scare you - be aware of your civil rights. Germany is a country of law; if you did not break any law, don't worry &amp; be happy.

There is no reason why honest people shall refrain from mentioning "bitcoin" in the transfer details, since trading bitcoins is not illegal. And even if it was illegal, banks have no authority to decide on such things - they are giving themselves rights that were never given to them by any law. Only court can decide what is illegal and it isn't a bank's business what a transfer is for, just like it isn't their business where did you get from a cash that you would want to deposit at your account.
They are actually violating a customer's privacy by reading these descriptions - judging their content is even worse and is totally illegal. I can bet on the fact that it is illegal.
Many people I sell BTC to mention it in the description and my bank has never had a problem with it. Well, at least my last bank - the previous one I had to sue... :)
@_date: 2013-10-15 14:29:19
But who is talking about _net worth_?
I was talking about **money creation** - an opposite to a _wealth creation_, thus a _net worth_.
FED creates the money, along with the banks. 
And you sir - you obviously have not herd about a _fractional reserve system_, since you seem to state that money is only created by _people buying government bonds_.
You are wrong! Money is also created by banks, when they give loans to people - no bonds required then.

They won't be the first ones. 
There already is a working bitcoin node, written in Go:

I don't know how they do it, but I would have implemented it in a way that the address which was never seen in a block chain before - this one gets the change.
If none of the two addresses was seen in the chain, then just take a half of the transaction's amount.

What are you talking about?
You private PGP key is a certificate - just like an SSL certificate. 
Just like with SSL, you can use a private PGP key to sign as many bitcoin addresses as you want, thus giving the recipient of your message a proof that the bitcoin address you are sending him was not altered by a third party - isn't it what all this is about?
The difference is that a PGP key you can generate yourself - while getting an SSL certificate requires you to take your ID to a CA, where you get to pay them for logging your data.

sorry man, as much as I would like to answer you, my initial comment has been totally voted down by the scared american slaves, so I will just not waste any more time on posting there where nobody reads. :)
but I see that you get my point.
personally I think that banks feel threatened by bitcoin itself and therefore they attack people from the bitcoin community, using all the possible tricks they know; and that includes pulling string in governments.
but this is normal and expected.
what is not normal and worrying is that the bitcoin community is such a big bunch of fearful pussies. they not only are totally afraid of fighting for their constitutional freedoms, but also attack people who try to encourage them into doing so.

Just install a standard client on a PC that has no internet connection and run it.
This will auto-generate a new wallet.dat for you. Make sure to have a reliable and safe (password protected) backup of this file, before transferring any money there!
Now, if you transfer any coins to any of the addresses from the wallet (you can get them from the offline client), they will end up in a cold storage - you will be able to spend them later on by using wallet.dat from the offline PC. You won't see the coins in your offline PC since it cannot acquire the blockchain, but they will be there (use blockachin.info to check the balance).
Don't ever move wallet.dat to an online PC, until you want to spent the coins! 
There are also ways of spending the coins while still keeping wallet.dat only at the offline PC, but that's another story.
@_date: 2013-10-16 21:32:01


Technically it is possible, though it is not an actual reversal, but just a transfer going the other way around. It has been known that some banks do it sometimes - especially to those customers who don't firmly protest.
Legally - not, they have no right to do it without your consent, unless the transfer was a technical mistake, like a typo in a/c number and so you were not even expecting it. But it is obviously not the case here.
Remember that as soon as the bank books an amount at your account, it becomes your property and it gets protected by a civil law, a constitution and even the european convention on human rights (protocol 1).
Don't buy into a bullshit about a bank protocol requirements or something - there is no such law.

OK, thanks.
So it explains why FinCEN issues licenses, but it doesn't seem to give FinCEN a right to (re)define what a "money transferal service" is. Unless you missed that part?
If FinCEN does not have a right to define what a "money transferal service" is then nobody in a country of law needs to care about their _ruling_ on the matter. And from the part you quoted, it seems clear that their job is to issue licenses, not to decide who must have a license and who can go without it.
