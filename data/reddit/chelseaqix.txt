Bitconnect coin is absolutely not worth .2BTC how is $50 20% of $2900? .2 is $580 lol... try .0175

I'm not saying they don't appear to be the most legitimate. I use them myself for converting fiat to bitcoin. That doesn't mean that I don't believe anyone there is capable of fraud and it only takes one bad egg to clean or siphon a little off the top of their cold storage. If they had a massive issue with theft it would be in their best interest to try to replace what was stolen than to shut their doors or let everyone know.

I feel like you're trolling
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:21:29
You're right. No one would commit fraud in America for millions of dollars in profit. That's absurd. The laws will prevent them from being greedy or bad people. Thank goodness you set this straight.

I had a bitcoin and ethereum shirt but i stopped wearing them considering i've been trading since 2015... now I'm scared someone will have increased reason to steal my macbook.
This laptop is worth $3000 and people rob 7-11's for $26. If they only knew how much money I had just in my hot wallet that I'm trading at any given moment.
Am I the only one whose become paranoid with bitcoin hitting $6k+?

"Pam Beach, Florida"
For a legal document involving 10 billion dollars I would think they'd spell "Palm Beach" correctly.

how's your ROI
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:36:35
I was gonna say the same... I've been trading since 2015 and I'm currently at somewhere around 20,000% profit. When I do the numbers I always think I'm doing something wrong but no... I'm up twenty thousand percent...

You can afford the entire supply of bitcoin at $300? That's roughly 5 billion dollars...
@_date: 2017-05-22 01:48:26

@_date: 2017-07-17 00:09:16
shit I have no interest in swapping back into bitcoin unless the rate is .11 again
@_date: 2017-07-22 00:55:44
This made me laugh way more than it should've... reddit is ruthless.

Oh you bought with bank transfer... Yep. You're locked in. Enjoy the ride.

Someone gonna let the US government know they missed like 8 million dollars?
@_date: 2017-07-29 09:32:11
So.. you found $21,000 in your attic?
@_date: 2017-07-29 23:04:14
I like how you morons downvoted me just because some person on the internet said so
Read the article and learn how tumbling works. If this is a coinbase wallet they stole 160 million dollars because if you look there's thousands of transactions breaking that 160 million into 50k over and over.
EDIT: I just realized his name is ... are you guys slow?

2.03... sarah
@_date: 2017-07-17 01:58:09
it's at 163 so sell it if you're scurred
@_date: 2017-07-29 09:35:05
BTC-e tumbled the coins away. The US Government didn't screw you. The guy who stole all the coins did.
@_date: 2017-07-29 23:07:43
right now they're probably moving bitcoins from cold storage periodically so I imagine that's what's slowing them down. They could've avoided all this effort by just producing the BCC lol
@_date: 2017-07-27 23:18:43
BitconnectCoin is a massive Ponzi scheme anyways.... Even though BitcoinClownCash is a joke it'll probably outlast bitconnect.
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:04:50
I've been experiencing this problem as well... Maybe someone knows a fix?
