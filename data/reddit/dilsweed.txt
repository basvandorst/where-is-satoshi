So say you earn 20% and $1000 profit. You decide to go and treat yourself to a dinner, or pay bills, etc or maybe reinvest into an altcoin and spend half your profits. You still have your initial capital investment and 50% of your 20% returns ($500) invested.

Yea you sell $200 of bitcoin for spending cash and keep the rest invested. That's not day trading, it's taking profit off the top of your investment. That's what a lot of people do, because after all, your investing to have more money to spend.
Personally I'm running the long term hodl. I never sell. 
Day trading would be selling crypto just to try and buy in lower that same day. This is incredibly difficult due to the random volatility and many people, including myself, advise against it.
If you just choose some solid coins and walk away for a year, you will likely come back to 8-10 times your original money (800%-1000%).
Edit: now if bitcoin makes a giant run up like we recently saw and you sold at $10k because you had strong reason to believe a correction was coming and watched it for a week, that's different. Again, day trading is making multiple daily trades trying to predict price movement on a day to day basis.

Firstly, it's practically impossible to build a computer strong enough to just "dominate" the mining sector. Each bitcoin is harder to mine than the last and our current technology is a major limiting factor.
Nobody controls millions of bitcoins (that I know of). There is also a cap at 21 million bitcoins. If someone starts buying off huge sums of bitcoins in an attempt to own a large portion of the market, the only thing that happens is price goes up. That would take billions though. As for dumping large amounts into the market, we saw a huge dump just the other day. This is the result (pretty minor imo, just discounted coins).
I don't wanna sound like an ass, but if you know this little about the currency don't invest. You owe it to yourself to understand what you're putting your money into. I know this post is a form of research, but it's pretty inefficient. Go hit up YouTube, tons of great explanatory videos there

Taking profits off the top to spend or reinvest into other coins is one thing. That's a pretty normal thing to do.
Attempting to time the market or trade around altcoins and try to work more bitcoins into your portfolio daily will wreck you. You'll end up with less bitcoin worth than when you started.
Unless you're a seasoned day trader with years of experience, I would suggest that the crypto market is not the place to learn. It's your money though, I'm just speaking from personal experience and witnessing countless others lose bitcoins over time.

Hit up some YouTube videos, there's some really good ones out there. There's some good info in these comments too.
There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence (even less in our lifetime). This means that if it ever becomes popular enough that hundreds of millions of people use the currency, owning one whole bitcoin will be a pretty rare (and expensive) thing.

Well if nearly the last decade of history says anything....
Yea it's gunna hit 5k. We just finished a bull run, the market is due for some bear activity. Anythings possible in the crypto game though (like seriously, shit never ceases to amaze me). If it hits just 5k though and stops I'm not even sure I'd call it a bull run, more like a spike or a correction. If it doubles in price in under a month again, I'd call that a bull run.

By nature, most bubbles have similar structure. However, using this to predict future prices is crude at best. You can really only ever guess what phase you're in. So basically, if capitulation or despair hasn't hit, then you know you have more down, but you cant decipher how far down from such charts.
