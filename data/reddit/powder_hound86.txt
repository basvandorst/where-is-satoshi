Lol no. 
Miners will have half as many coins to sell to cover costs. 
Less sell orders = prices move higher

I think they were implying that the libertarian belief that bitcoin would disrupt the financial system is a pipe dream


The financial system juggernaut could easily dominate the bitcoin network and market with their vast resources. Does anyone doubt they heavily manipulate other commodity markets? That is what this article is implying, that bitcoin isn't going to change a damn thing in terms of vampire squid TBTF banks

I haven't fallen for anything. I don't blindly accept anything written, I guess I shoudl say: If this is true then it concerns me greatly.

No, because apple's defining feature is not decentralization, rather the opposite.

If you want mass adoption, yes.

not quite. 
If the aircraft is capable of accelerating vertically that means it has more thrust than weight and can climb straight up indefinitely until the engines start to run out of oxygen. 
Any plane can go vertical and typically will *decelerate*  until they stall. You can see in this GIF this jet isn't far off a stall towards the end. I suspect this is boeing showing capability and they probably have the jet stripped down entirely for these maneuvers.
LEts hope this isn't what actually happens to bitcoin.
