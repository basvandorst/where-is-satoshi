Is it bad to run a full node every once in a while? Like on a desktop that only gets powered on a couple times a week? Let the synch catch up and help process transactions for a few hours to a few days?

That link is about lightening nodes. I was more so wondering about a core nodes. I would let it run at least 6 hours and give it time to exit properly before shut down.

So this guy thinks that the price will go from (approximately) $2500 in 2021 to $250000 by mid 2023? what could possibly trigger such an increase all the while the price held steady or slowly declining from now [Aug 2018] to 2021 proposed bull run? Is that similarly represented by the 2016 run from $200 to 2017's $20000?

I always thought it provided leverage against Visa/swift and credit cards in general because it took multiple days until the recipient had absolute control of those funds whereas cryptocurrencies provide faster attainment of said value. If the mentioned is true, what is stopping the more popular transaction methods to establish similar or improved fungability and upon bringing that to fruition.. what happens?

Is this Nasdaq's doing? Getting ready for their exchange launch this month? Trying to stir up some excitement?

But what if they are just miners or other btc income receivers that are only trying to liquidate at a higher price?
@_date: 2019-04-06 01:21:47
The ascending triangle that was trackable since March was pretty clear when the launch would be on a weekly chart. I've definitely witnessed some common  lt recognized bullish sybles play out in high probability.

Just the total of less funds in the exchanges cold storage will appear less and possible strengthen the scarcity of the currency. I do believe there is potential in some people losing some of their value through improper handling of their recovery seeds and what not. But, just the impression of them viewed with smaller market shares could also encourage them to buy more at the same time.

if BCH had more transaction volume to make up a larger block, their fees wouldn't necessarily go up, right? Because your transaction would most likely fit into the "next" 32MB block?  BTCs blocks are often full and individuals or algorithms choose to pay more fees to be included in the next block. I'm just wondering, if the volume was flipped, would BCHs blocks be like 10MB by now? how much longer does BTC have to wait for their transaction to be cleared through the mem pool at 1sat/byte when it could have been included in the next BCH big block?

Calling on someone to create a nano pie bitcoin miner that is nearly plug and play with a few set up commands and sell it for $49.99. I'd imagine a ton of people would connect it to their wifi to contribute to the decentralization. I suppose the biggest issue is storage. I think, the hardest issue for me is keeping my computer on all the time

I don't think the price would go down if he transferred them to someone else's wallet. If they were put on an exchange then yes, the price would react to the sell pressure but I don't believe that is what OP is suggesting. Granted, if those individuals would receive the coins and even the minority of them would attempt to sell, the price would go down but in this hypothetical, wouldn't Bitcoin be the dominate currency in the world and selling would be futile by that time.

Looking at the transaction volume at the end of 2016 doesnt align with my charts.
