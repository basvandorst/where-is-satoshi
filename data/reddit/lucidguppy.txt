When banks exchange money digitally - what prevents one bank from giving the other bank fake digital money?

Thinking about it - they should just set up gyft - and then use the btc you send them.

OK - I might not get it.  It's all fake money.  I just thought there would be some "blessed" spigot from the fed, and everyone else would keep their books straight.

You might get something going if remittances were in bitcoin.  The average person can't trade goods or services for bitcoin outside of Venezuela. I don't see bitcoin working in collapsing economies until there is a cheap and easy phone app that works on low end phones.

It would be nice if the government gave a program to us to figure out taxes owed for all our transactions for businesses/individuals in bitcoin.  (Open source of course to ensure they're not sending unwanted stuff).

I just downloaded multibit as it's the download recommended...
Perhaps I'm over thinking this stuff - but there's so many warnings and recommendations (  They were recommending tor ( - and that's where I got tied up with gpg sigs trying to install multibit (as that had a gpg signature too).  The pages make bitcoin seem complicated/scary.

So more like $15 and $200?

I have a feeling people are working on this already, but I thought I'd ask first and give it a try as well.

Whoa thanks!  That's actually great motivation. ;-)
