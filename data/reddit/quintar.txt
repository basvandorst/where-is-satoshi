I can't speak to how connections others have, but mine tends to hover somewhere between 40 and 60 connections.  54 right now:
    [root ~]# netstat -nap | grep ESTABLISHED | grep -c 8333
    54

I'm with ya.  The nerve of some people expecting facts along with their assertions.

The author in the article made a big mistake.


That image clearly shows Chinese Yuan, not dollars.  I hope that wasn't a mistake and that the author has successfully predicted the future value of bitcoin.

Unfortunately this does practically nothing to apple but alienates those whom are still doing business with them.
Limiting choices helps bitcoin how exactly?
This is the kind of shit PayPal pulls.
You're welcome to do as you please with your company but you are not speaking for the entire bitcoin community by any stretch; just those with loud knee-jerk reactions.

I checked the hot, the new, and the rising front pages and saw nothing.  Sorry, I guess I should've put changetip in the title.
Nice account name btw.

If you read the [TOS]( it says:


So, you might be breaking the terms if you let us know how it goes for you, haha.


I guess there's not much of a risk with that small of an investment, but I choose not to do business with companies this secretive, and I do read their policies before agreeing.  I wouldn't possibly ever agree to this.  Legally they can charge you 50 Billion just for logging in without letting you know ahead of time.  Likely?  No, but I won't enter into an agreement that would allow it.
And, contradicting their FAQ which states they are 'registered', it also states:


Their marketing and legal teams cannot even agree on what they are.

My vagina was perfectly clean until this douche came along.
Oh the irony...

Teach a man to fish and he tells you to go fuck yourself for not fishing for him.
Have you seen your own comment score? It's negative bro.
Edit:  Just because I've never used sodisfund either, I felt I should give you some advice.
The domain sodisfund.biz was registered 33 days ago.  The domain was registered using a privacy service, thereby hiding the actual registrant's details.  There is no physical address located anywhere on the site that I can see, and no toll-free number listed anywhere.  They are 'officially registered' according to their FAQ but no mention of whom they are registered with or what for.
Please do us all a favor and test it out.

That still doesn't make it the first art fair.  
You should get a job in American journalism; you fact just as much.
Argue all you want, I'm just trying to clear up misinformation about my city (or I guess as you would describe it, quaint 3rd world village without running water or electricity).
We even have our very own [modern art museum]( that's been here for 45 years.  
And that's just one of the many cities that are lumped into 'Silicon Valley'.

It's nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be.  Over 2 months, a little over half a TiB.  This is on a VPS that's open to the world, not behind a NAT that's unreachable from the outside.

Probably after seeing 'first Art Fair' and then actually reading the article.   Its the first time *this* art fair was held..  
As for being the first art fair (ever) in Silicon Valley (which is how I read the title too), there's nothing about that statement that's argueably accurate.  There's a monthly art fair in downtown San Jose the [first Friday]( of every month for starters.

So what you're saying is workers (bitcoiners) should band together and form a union (bu) to negotiate against management (core)?

What a sad state of the subreddit if bullshit like this is the top post.
