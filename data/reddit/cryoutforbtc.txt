 This is JetFlashTranscend 8GB fitted with my 5.5 bitcoin!
But im on the oher side... Its gone. While ago i play 10$ tourney at Americas cardroom, cash out, 
and stored. Oon this drive. Forgot up until this week. Its 110k$ from last night score in fiat. I 
put my drive in my PC. Bad sectors. Im try all data recovery software. Even find a guy, that tell 
me use DMDE. He says its the best around, put it on FULL check, if nothing happen, only some 
university with special equipment may help u. It was bootable usb with Lubuntu and electrum. It 
doesnt help me. nothing help me. I live in Ukraine and work for a 160$ in month. Do it some 
makeover with University, for me its like going to the moon.U need be in Ukraine to feel it. My 
live changing money gone, MATRIX has me. I already get drunk. Tomorrow will cry again.
P.S. Happy New Year.
