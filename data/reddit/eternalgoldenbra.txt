I don't think inflation is much of an issue, altcoins pretty much  share a fixed amount of worth between them I would think. The big deal for me is when explaining bitcoin to (already confused) friends.

There are so many differences, but even if everything was exactly the same, one major thing differs by definition: it has happened before. - Which should speed up the process. The 2011 crash removed a whole lot of uncertainty about 0 as a likely value for one thing.

I always use SEPA transfers. You just transfer (in EUR) to MtGox's Polish bank account. Usually takes three days.

I was surprised by the crash, but (the way it unfolded) not that it continued down. I think it is caused by a one off event of some kind and thus that the former price (100-120) is a better indicator of the "true price" than the current price, but short term (&lt;2 months) is impossible to say.
So we disagree on everything it seems

Sounds like you might have a faulty hard drive.

I think Peter Thiel might know as much or more about bitcoin as you. Be sure to report back what he says, should be interesting.

So could I move to Germany and not have to pay tax? Currently I live in a neighboring country and have over €30k of bitcoin taxes to look forward to when I start exchanging back to fiat.

Been there, done that. I sold at ~75 and rebought at ~75 (I thought) on the day the exchange rate bottomed out at $50.1, but ended up with 150 BTC less. Live and learn. I broke my own rule, won't happen again. Cheers!

Zero is about as likely as a thermonuclear war.

You really should get a programmer that knows what he's doing when handling money instead of just copying code and hope that it will work. Chances are there will be security holes long after it seems to work. (Maybe that's what you're hoping to achieve with this post?)

Yes, but they are growing pains, this particular round was courtesy of fincen. I think it is fine if people continue to use mtgox if it works for them, whatever they do they can't stop things from improving :) So I think it is worrying only in the short term, and I think people would be better off ignoring the short term when it comes to bitcoin.

Where do you see that the number is rising? It is probably just how many real shares the person handling the pass through has. It will increase if someone with real share converts them to PTs to be able to sell them on an exchange. There are many different PTs for asicminer - DeadTerra, BurnSide and so on.

But giving GPU miners something to do can never be a reason in and of itself. Someone needs to pay for those copycoins.
As for the other reasons you list, the hash that differs between bitcoin and litecoin is only used for proof of work, so any (reasonably) successful attack on sha256 would only be met by increasing the difficulty.
Faster confirmations - sure, but it is a trade off, Satoshi choose ten minutes for this.
The real reason in my opinion is that people wish they were in on BTC from the beginning.

I was thinking about the same thing but I ended up buying shares in Asicminer instead. "My" part of AM's TH/s isn't as big as I would have gotten if I had bought my own mining gear, but on the other hand it will be upgraded over time, by a team of electrical engineers that have actually delivered so far.
Also, no waiting time, within a week you'll have your first dividend payment (currently around 1% of what you buy for).
* Pass though shares (or a bit of a hassle converting them)
* Shares are not very liquid, you need to find a buyer before you can spend your coins (but dividends are in BTC of course)
* A bit tedious to set up account at the exchanges

I'm so glad I sold at $2.50..........

It could be memory and power supply too. Memory is easily testable so start with that.

Great, I think that this is the best recommendation to give people that come in to bitcoin with the intention to mine on their GPU or CPU. Buy shares in a goldmine instead of going digging in the ground yourself. Those days are gone.
@_date: 2013-07-06 05:14:26
Are those numbers graphed somewhere? I had the feeling from the start that someone was trying to sell off a shitload of BTCs without disrupting the market too much (good luck), or maybe he just wanted to get payed.

Sure, there is very little bitcoin-commerce still, but no one in their right mind could ever have expected anything else. What reason does the average user have to use BTC instead of their credit card? None
We're still only at the point where VCs start pumping in money into new ventures. Like the boo.com days of internet commerce.
So I don't think that failed expectations is the reason for falling prices.
Somehow, I get the feeling that the fall started because one big fish started a massive slow sell off. (Then the scourge of the earth - technical analysts - began working their magic.)

E-Gold is very well known in the bitcoin community. E-gold is to Bitcoin what Napster was to bittorrent.

I sold half of mine because I really don't understand what's happening. The problem for asicminer in the long run (but what's great about bitcoin) is that the transaction-signing business will be open to all comers, so all the success they are having right now will mean very little in 2-3 years time. Still, I believe that they will do well and maybe hang on the a 15-25% part of the network in the long run, but I can't really back that up with a real argument.
@_date: 2013-07-06 23:27:04
Yes, that's why I phrased it like I did.
My take on it would be that the price still is a couple of magnitudes short of the final price, making huge swings unavoidable. I think that there is manipulation, but it is not needed to explain what we're seeing now.
Also, this far, bitcoin price has been a better predictor for media interest than the other way around.

Bitcoin is decentralized because it is a p2p network without a central server. Let's not reuse the word for the case "one company has a big marketshare, and might affect the price somewhat for a limited time if it fails"

The market shot to the moon because it has no depth and it is sinking now because it has no depth. Neither matters, and in a few years it will be a thing of the past.
