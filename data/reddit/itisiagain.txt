Never say never.
What prevents the satellites from being disabled?
My point remains the same, Bitcoin is vulnerable to a single point of failure.

IMO, Bitcoin is here to stay.
BUT... the only value of a monetary system is the actual use of that system.
So if you buy Bitcoin and just HODL, you are in it for greed and not really in it to develop and use the no-trusted third party value transfer abilities of the system.
So again IMO, no system can eliminate greed from the equation.

I know.

There are costs for everything.

Also true.
But two people aren't going to be able to transact much business alone, so there wouldn't be much point.
I am not against Bitcoin as a value transfer platform. But talk of it being invulnerable is naive. IMO.

More complexity equals more things to go wrong.
Do you have the equipment to access these satellites?
Probably not.

All require communal efforts and networking.
None of it can be done alone.
And anyone who understands Bitcoin knows why the banks are terrified of the idea.

True. But the post is about banks and Bitcoin.


Also agreed.




Having an effective network is optional? A car doesn't need a driver to be a car. But then what is the point of having either?
IMO, both are simply tools to accomplish an end.


I am definitely talking about both the scale and networking sides of the issue. IMO, both are necessary for a functioning system.


I am not trying to say what is right for anybody.
And we both agree the possibilities for blockchain technology are amazing.

Just be sure the Internet never goes down.

Very cool.
Thanks for the info.

If you truly believe no one should ever sell, how will Bitcoin work as an exchange medium?

If you go there you can buy the domain for 99 cents from GoDaddy.
Not a very good sign.

Gold and Bitcoin suffer from the same scarcity mentality.

A Swiss bank account in your pocket, as long as the internet keeps working.
What could go wrong there?
