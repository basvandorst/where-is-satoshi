I only sell. My bitcoins are generated through services I offer. Some are held for investment purposes, others are sold to pay living expenses.

Graphic/Web designer here just wanted to give my input. You say:


That animated video was really well executed and I think it turned out very good at explaining the very basics to someone new.
As far as everything else looking aesthetically bad as I said before I'm a designer and I hope to make an impact on aesthetics in the bitcoin world. I have worked with many companies and individuals creating logos/websites and other graphics for their businesses. Other designers are actively working in the bitcoin world and improving it one step at a time.


I agree this looks bad. A little bit of design work and a logo could really improve their traffic and the credibility of bitcoin. This is a very good point. I would really like to see this done.
Just think about how "real" bitcoin is right now and how much improvement there is to be made. I don't see it slowing growth anytime soon personally.

Because it's easy to use and fast. Also 1% fee is a reasonable price to pay. My 2 cents.

a "normal person" you say... I'm not normal? Hahaha. Good post it's true, bitcoin has a long way to go as far as making it easier to use but luckily it has a great community backing it and pushing it forward. I often get very optimistic thinking as you said "Oh man...in X amount of years each bitcoin will be worth so much!" and then have to talk myself down and keep myself in check. I love watching it grow and being a part of it. I hope to see it never stop growing until it completely takes over. Bitcoins are one of the greatest inventions I've ever heard of, and to think I only heard about them because I grabbed a bite with a friend at Five Guys one day.
