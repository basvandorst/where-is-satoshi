Understandable, i'm a dude and I'm wary. Still, this looks pretty good to go to next time

Thank you! The block size. So that is related to all the posts I've been seeing about Segwit lately (I left bitcoin awhile ago but keep my nose poked in from time to time). 
@_date: 2016-11-20 08:15:23
Has Bitcoin solved that transaction time problem? Where only a few transactions in the world can be processed at one time, meaning it's no longer instantaneous?
@_date: 2012-04-18 07:02:28
No taxes for welfare, roads, schools, hospitals, investment in the future, huge pension bills, international debt repayments... I'm generally a low-tax kinda guy but when kids can't get medicine at hospitals and they can't pay staff, then your country is fucked.

cheers bro... how bout posting up some of them details then, hey

You guys should review cryptbro.com, developed by another bitcoin aficionado (and also a redditor).

Well, I'm not going to play a game of "Yes, but..." however that seems needlessly complex and will result in higher prices for patients (like the broken American system). Profits in the healthcare sector should be minimised or outlawed. 
@_date: 2012-04-19 07:07:33
No, you have a situation like Australia, where it's Government controlled and you pay for it in your taxes, where I cut off part of my finger and had emergency surgery, plastic surgery, and two follow-up consultations for absolutely nothing. Be careful what you want to privatise. When I go to hospital, I want to be a person, not a dollar sign.

It's what the guy who hacked bitcoinica was doing.

Care to explain that to me?

What is a gox, anyway.
I'm guessing Mt. stands for MagicalTux. 
Gox is probably a substitution cipher for something secret ;)
@_date: 2011-09-12 00:56:55
Ah, I see - my mistake. Thanks for the update.
@_date: 2011-09-27 04:34:48
They are the only people USING Bitcoin how it's meant to be used.
I suggest you idiots waiting for the price to rise actually do something with your coins instead of waiting. Contribute to your economy rather than just being a parasite!
I support this action. Go Robots!

He runs the MtGox subreddit, he seems legit.
@_date: 2011-09-11 03:43:43
Honestly guys bitcoin's biggest problem IMHO is the BITCOIN COMMUNITY. All of a sudden you have crypto nerds who never owned or ran anything in their life becoming business owners and managing other people's money. 
This is fine - but it should be seen as a spur for growth and learning. Being smart and knowing about bitcoin does NOT mean you can run a successful business or even be any kind of investor or speculator. 
There's a rough road ahead - scams, hacks, people going under, etc. If we embrace the communities who are actually using bitcoin properly (anti government types, drugs, silk road etc) we might actually get somewhere. 
I don't think you realise how dangerous Bitcoin is to governments around the world. You are all now defacto criminals in their eyes, and if you're not prepared, you will be chewed up and spit out.
@_date: 2011-09-11 22:14:23
I see your point, but its rather "thintelligent." You have to take the wider picture into consideration - you can't buy or use the US dollar without considering US problems, can you? Or the AUD or the Swiss Franc...
Just the same, you have to realise the Bitcoin community has a large influence over the currency, and you have to take that into account. For example, the pump n dump schemes, the price spiking, the hack and selloff, silk road etc. 
@_date: 2011-11-14 07:43:10
Thanks - I've been keeping an eye on them for awhile, and was hoping they would have a cash deposit option. Any idea if this is on the agenda for the market?
@_date: 2011-06-20 00:35:57
Great work, thanks!

Okay, groovy 
@_date: 2011-09-01 22:05:37
Its important to note that this is a test run. There will be a bitcoin 2, and 3, and 12... and you can mine all of these as an early adopter.
This is the future, its just not evenly distributed yet.
@_date: 2011-05-24 07:57:38
That really does sound good.
@_date: 2011-05-24 01:07:12
How do you pronounce it? I mentally say "Mount Gox" when its probably pronounced "Em-Tee Gox" or something, right?
@_date: 2011-05-19 22:32:52
Hey, they look fucking cool. Are they legal to send to Australia? Or rather, will they get picked up ;)
@_date: 2011-06-09 21:50:55
CMONNNN SOMEONE HIRE THIS GUY
@_date: 2011-11-14 07:48:15
Ah - that makes a lot of sense. Thank you. So I should monitor the markets and on a day with low volatility, purchase the coins at hopefully less of a gap?
@_date: 2011-06-06 08:22:43
I can't see the link between the precious metal and the digital currency. Explain?

Would this be easy to set up?
I.e. battery charger, inverter, bank of car batteries... timer?
Don't know how much the grow lights would take, but if you could store a few hours worth of electricity in the batteries, thats all you'd need.

Yeah, I don't understand this preoccupation with ethics in bitcoin .. we are running an alternate currency to the USD... countries have been bombed for that. You either win or you die, game of thrones style.

Just curious - any idea why the price is $2.21 AUD per coin on the main page, but is $3.20 on the Buy AUD/NZ page?

Ah, found one from about 2 and a half months after the genesis block:
@_date: 2011-09-11 03:32:54
@_date: 2011-11-14 03:48:19
Absolutely. 
I feel like it will soon reach the point where it will be the currency for our generation. And naturally, you have disillusioned losers dragging it down, as they will anything that has the potential for success. But with our father's generation's financial systems in disarray, its about time we create something new.

Because its a currency they can not control. 
That is more threatening to governments than bombs exploding or terrorists on planes. All of a sudden the people have their own money. No Fed, no reserve bank, no interest rates. No taxes. 
No government.
@_date: 2011-11-14 06:49:57
Agreed. I hadn't heard about Moneypak, it sounds good. I wonder if there is an australian equivalent.
@_date: 2011-09-11 05:04:08
Definitely. Well written and something everyone should read.
If the power in Bitcoin goes entirely to the nerds, the concept itself is doomed. While I disagree with you on the negative stigma of drugs (it can prove to be a huge drawcard for the currency) essentially you are spot on. 
Basically, Bitcoin needs balls.
@_date: 2011-06-03 10:02:37
a SEE SAW UPWARDS! 
@_date: 2011-08-01 09:18:11
I doubt Mt. Gox could have honoured the request. 
@_date: 2011-07-29 00:55:36
Agreed. I think its time to start discussing the dark part of Bitcoin - and how we can profit from it. 
@_date: 2011-06-09 04:48:12
You're right. 
When you stop seeing bitcoins as a currency and start seeing it as a method of money laundering, drug currency, a method for oppressed people to get money out of failing regimes, things like that - that you can also use to buy night lights and send cash to people and donate to the EFF... you start to see how it won't really fail, but will skyrocket. 
When the mafia start using it, you will see a lot of trades, not necessarily a lot of storing of coins... as they will simply use it as a transaction method to wash money and move it around the world. 
@_date: 2011-11-27 00:24:12
I thought it was great too. Much the way that I enjoy Hollywood movies, you turn off your brain and enjoy.
The Last Symbol, however, was incredible for me, because I'm into all that Hermetic stuff and it was hugely inspirational. *"Know not that ye are gods?* - Hermetic Saying

@_date: 2011-07-29 00:58:27
Respect. 
Hey, just because some other people have failed to monetise this doesn't mean you can't.
You're only limited by yourself. So make a laundry - and advertise it as a way to hide your money if you're divorced, like we said above. Sell it to drug dealers. Whatever you want, and whatever you have the balls to do!
THE FUTURE IS **YOURS**.
@_date: 2011-06-04 13:56:00
*Deep advertising voice*
When you buy Bitcoin, you're not just buying a secure, cryptographic currency. You're also buying anonymity, freedom from rules, freedom from regulations, from interference, from inflation.
Your Bitcoins can be used at hundreds of merchants across the web, with many more being added daily. You can make Bitcoins in the security of your own home. And you can make payments and send money instantly, for no cost, around the world. 
Bitcoin. Its the way of the future.
@_date: 2011-05-16 01:21:57
You're absolutely right.
When people figure out how to use btc for money laundering, the price will skyrocket and stay there. 
its main strength is its anonymity and its secrecy. put 1% of the global drug money through BTC and it will explode.

No source that I can give you offhand, but it's true of many financial jurisdictions... in fact it's the default in a lot of cases where countries don't have an information-sharing agreement. 
Jump onto the Google and look at the tax and bank secrecy laws for the HK SAR. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:06:09
Like money? Or gold?
@_date: 2013-01-28 02:05:42
They don't report anything to overseas authorities. It's illegal under HK law.
However, lately they are co-operating with authorities more often once a crime has been proven. So basically, you're free until you get caught and they know of the accounts existence.
