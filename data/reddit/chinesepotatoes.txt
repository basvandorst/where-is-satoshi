What actually? I’m moving all my funds out of it
@_date: 2019-06-23 18:34:23
I’m done being fair with their opinions lol
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:11:41
It’s true, but it’s also a season. Bitcoin may moon, but its naive to think the money and profits won’t be hedged into alts at one point or another. Just market cycles
@_date: 2019-06-23 18:23:23
Amen brotha

I think the ones making a real difference are educating their own personal circles while having a healthy disrespect for the big news that is clearly lacking perspective.

Haha no one uses it but we got the sticker still
@_date: 2019-04-25 06:28:43
Mining is getting crazy up here. It’s becoming the new oilfield
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:10:53
Very naive perception of parkour: but thanks for the comment
@_date: 2019-04-25 06:29:07
Thank you ������
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:11:36
Sure I’ll see if I can upload some on here
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:26:59
Up here in Canada we can easily pay utility bills and pay off our credit card, or convert to cash within minutes
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:32:14
A couple have: but most coin holders are hodlrs at least until another bull run. 
Bitpay makes bookkeeping easier, and allows us to invoice and such so it’s necessary
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:22:00
I love playing with blockchain
@_date: 2019-04-27 16:13:40
Yep figured it out :)
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:29:54
That’s right. We are the youth!
@_date: 2019-04-25 03:39:12
Right haha
@_date: 2019-04-25 18:14:35
Yo know it. Just operate on it. No capital gains that way
@_date: 2019-04-25 19:27:57
Yehi get that but before you know it we’ll be on lightning. Plus we’re going to be working with Ternio - which is currently the world’s fastest blockchain at 1million tps
@_date: 2019-04-25 18:13:48
 New facility in a year :)

@_date: 2019-04-25 15:27:41
No. Most people just think I’m a craskpot and swear they will never pay with bitcoin. Waiting for them to choke on their words lol

Don’t give up at all: think of Parkour as “Movement Capacity” 
You cannot look at someone else’s movement capacity and be discouraged. You need to look at your current movement capacity and seek ways to expand it. 
That’s the simple answer, and it’s a lifelong thing. But I will say that I can help more if you specifically message me. We can talk about ideas for you. Ive helped tons of adults rediscover their movement.
@_date: 2019-04-26 21:06:42
- there is a vast difference between the kids who train with us, and their classmate counterparts in terms of physical literacy and general fitness capacity. That’s not a debate.
- we take an educational approach: and fill many of the gaps of the Canadian Physical Education Cirriculum. 
- in an age when parents are concerned for their child not having that natural physical literacy we all had growing up, they appreciate and highly value our service.
- we provide a sport/safe haven place for kids who don’t fit into other, more competitive sports, to come and just be theirselves while learning how to set goals and achieve them.
- parkour has tons of technical detail involved in improving human movement capacity, whatever the demographic. Being able to move safely and efficiently applies to everyone. 
- the cost on the healthcare system in Canada from preventable fitness related disease is over 4 billion: this highlights a true economic need for actual physical literacy, and not just playing dodge ball in gym class. 
- we are contracted by both individuals and government organizations to give our expertise. People recognize this is not the type of activity you can just teach An average gym teach to use in their class: you need specialists with proper insurance: which didn’t exists, we had to develop that from scratch.
This is my life passion dude, I can go on and on
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:26:10
A couple but not many yet. Lots of people mining up here but little spending. anticipating lots of people using it after the next bull run when they’ve made some money
@_date: 2019-04-25 20:00:37
Odd are in our favour. 1 BTC holders are insanely more scarce than the current 1%
@_date: 2019-04-25 03:44:58
Thanks man I’m sure there a local parkour community out there if you want me to look them up let me know
@_date: 2019-04-25 06:59:27
I don’t have the lightning network set up yet
@_date: 2019-04-25 03:45:19
Yeh bitpay for now
@_date: 2019-04-25 06:26:24
No, we pay our taxes
@_date: 2019-04-25 05:00:34
Thank you I will look at this
@_date: 2019-04-25 18:15:36
@_date: 2019-04-25 18:15:06
Sure thing I’ll post that in a bit
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:11:17
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:22:51
Never too old because it’s all about increasing general movement capacity. If you can move, you can improve.
@_date: 2019-04-25 06:32:02
Please do. I would love to be the first in my city on this map
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:10:18
Settle down. Us Og parkour practitioners who have been training 13+ years have no more injuries than the average person gets. If anything we get less
@_date: 2019-04-25 04:59:58
I will be setting that up ��
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:30:54
@_date: 2019-04-25 06:32:56
Lol: there are quiet a few tax advantages though as the price rises haha
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:29:27
Yes! There are several specific techniques and drills that can be practiced in a controlled environment, plus it’s snowy here most of the year
@_date: 2019-04-25 07:00:25
I think we are the 7th or so parkour gym in Canada- I think we may be the first in the world to accept bitcoin officially
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:23:25
Nobody uses it but for whatever reason the stickers came with out POS
@_date: 2019-04-27 02:55:36
Tribute to an OG
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:30:38
We just have X amount of bills in the bank and we can pay our bills directly with bitcoin so it’s not as bad as people think

@_date: 2019-04-26 00:07:20
I know looks funny but it’s not fake lol. I actually bought all these stickers with bitcoin lol
@_date: 2019-04-25 06:27:03
A dream to do parkour, my friend?
@_date: 2019-04-25 01:14:39
Haha yeh our door looks horrible except for the beautiful bitcoin sticker lol
@_date: 2019-04-25 06:27:59
Haha, yep there’s quite a bit of us now but definately not a lot. Some of the parkour people I know where also some of the first I know to buy bitcoin
@_date: 2019-04-25 18:25:05
Grande Prairie Alberta: but I also do online fitness coaching globally
@_date: 2019-04-25 03:38:53
Hodl for now
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:25:19
I don’t get why people think it takes so long. It’s so fast
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:28:39
We get a new facility soon, but this one is pretty standard. Walls and rails check it out [gym facebook](facebook.com/apeparkour)
@_date: 2019-04-25 06:30:53
Not at all it’s faster than our debit and MasterCard system. Only needs the first confirmation to fulfill the invoice

they should be careful how they use the word Stellar... they don’t know wtf they talking about anyway
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:53:38
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:31:19
Let me know ��
@_date: 2019-05-19 17:27:33
Ok I understand. Not a big deal because it was lost a while ago but yeh I was just curious and thought it would be worth asking Reddit - thank you for the info
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:06:51
I know it’s still cheap now: I think it’s still cheap under 100k to be honest lol
@_date: 2019-05-27 23:16:14
Absolutely I know bitcoin is just numbers anyway nothing glamourours - have you looked into blockstream green?
@_date: 2019-05-08 16:59:29
Let the FOMO begin

@_date: 2019-05-24 17:06:54
While the wallet is unlocked
@_date: 2019-05-07 04:00:38
Use an incoicing app like bitpay or CoinPayments and then run everything through Edge wallet for books
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:12:29
I feel like this should just be a given that everyone is HODLing
@_date: 2019-05-04 15:52:41

No I won’t

Thanks for the question man. Honestly if I told you it was a single thing, it would be less of a valid statement. I personally don’t know how any OG whale would sell right now: after seeing the speed of blockchain industry since 2017 bubble.
@_date: 2019-05-11 02:21:09
I mean I am hedging a percentage of my BTC gains in these coins

What club are we in if we have 21 million BTC ?
@_date: 2019-05-05 05:26:27
No I have no reason to make them look bad, I just want my money back. 
I submitted my withdrawal in February! 
Have had multiple broken promises from the CEO himself for completing my withdrawal. 
Just when I think he’s doing it, I get an email saying the address I input was invalid. I thought that was strange because I always copy and paste addresses so there’s no chance for typos.
Luckily, I had printed of a copy of my withdrawl history prior to being on their radar: and went back to it to compare it to when my account said. Surely enough: the withdrawl address was changed in my account history.
