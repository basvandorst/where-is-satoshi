"Whereas gold can be physically stolen, bitcoin cannot"

That system is based on debt, but yes, it certainly is convenient.

Sure, they just need to be told to do it. If they can't handle backing up their seed, then they shouldn't trust themselves to own bitcoin.
Otherwise, the Trezor is pretty fool proof. It walks you through the entire backup process. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 13:28:39
I'm optimistic because bitcoin is scarce like gold and can't be manipulated by governments. Nor can it easily be banned. I think the technology is beautiful in its simplicity. Buying and storing gold can be difficult for some people, but bitcoin makes it easy to save money because of its nature as a digital currency (i.e. infinite divisibility, easy storage, etc).
As the infrastructure builds up, bitcoin will eventually have a UX that's simple enough for cautious or less intelligent people. As it stands now, bitcoin is relatively easy to lose. Although this is already easy to avoid with about 20 minutes of education.
I'm specifically interested in bitcoin because of the network it's built up, and its history of immutability.

Nah, $99 isn't too expensive for the target customer.

I think bitcoin is ready for smart and careful people. Once you buy some, my advice is to practice sending transactions so that you can become comfortable with your encryption password. And so you can see how it works.

Does anyone have reviews? How does it compare to the trezor?
@_date: 2016-08-25 14:21:43
I prefer using bitcoin on mobile. If you have Android, the mycelium/trezor combo is ace. 
I'd recommend writing your seed backup in a place you'll never forget. Also practice using bitcoin so you get a feel for it. Send a few transactions.
The mobile bitcoin experience is easy, secure, and feels the most futuristic. 
@_date: 2016-08-28 00:18:09
Of course it's a trade off for security. But the seed is better than the wallet.dat file. 
It will only get easier to use, but you have to be patient. I have no expectations of the masses adopting bitcoin in the current year. But it's silly to call the mnemonic seed "dumb shit".

I noticed that when I plugged in the trezor, it didn't prompt me for my pin. I would prefer that it did.
There's some serious stuff on this app like removing the pin and passwords. I didn't want to turn those off, but if I try, does it then prompt me for my pin?
@_date: 2016-08-27 21:15:18
Yeah, it's certainly an important perspective. Most people won't understand the importance of bitcoin backups. Physical security is much easier to understand because it's an age old problem.
That said, the author isn't even trying to understand bitcoin security. If you take the time to read up on it, it's easy to see that bitcoin security just takes a bit of extra knowledge.
But this is an article meant to promote gold investment. I don't expect him to bother with bitcoin because it's not part of his business. It's our job to explain the shortcomings of his article.

Bitcoin is an investment, like gold or stocks. It's a way to diversify your portfolio and control your wealth. 
The average redditor doesn't understand money and economics, so I wouldn't go into the FED, financial freedom or fiat currency. I would tell them that I predict that bitcoin will eventually jump from a $9B market cap to a $90B market cap. I think it's a great, undervalued asset. 
I would ask them, what are you gaining from leaving your money in the bank? Most people likely do so for the sake of comfort and familiarity. New technologies are scary and money/wealth is important. 
And then if this piques their interest, maybe they'd ask me why I'm so optimistic about the future of bitcoin. If they don't, I'd take their lack of curiosity as a lack of interest and I'd move on.

I can see why someone would be excited about buying a Tesla with bitcoin, and I wouldn't want to crush their enthusiasm. Bitcoin is money and you can be excited about it no matter what you use it for. 
More than 70% of bitcoin hasn't moved for 6 months or more. It seems that most people are using it as a safe haven asset and that's what I'm most excited about. I don't want to spend my bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-04-06 18:05:26
A grocery list would be an unnecessary flourish. No one is going to be aware of your million dollar bitcoin keys. You can smuggle them in your brain, on paper, or in a flash drive/mobile phone/laptop. Gold is way more conspicuous. I wouldn't feel comfortable moving any amount of gold across the border.
@_date: 2016-04-03 23:31:36
What's the point of bitcoin? Isn't it a form of money that can't be censored nor controlled by force? Either way, I think it makes sense for the author to be excited by a bitcoin purchase he's enthusiastic about. But is it a big deal? Maybe...

@_date: 2016-04-15 15:40:52
I think it's both. As long as bitcoin is secure and the network is running smoothly, consumer demand will affect the price. If another billion dollars enters the bitcoin economy, I'd expect the asking price to increase. 
@_date: 2016-04-15 18:25:43
I'm not sure. I think both are important, but is security more important? Maybe. Bitcoin can't exist unless it's secure but it won't be demanded unless it's easy to transact.

Don't go all central-planning on us! People will use the money they want to use. For most people today, that seems to be cash and credit cards.
The current fiat currencies will eventually be replaced, but cash should not be abolished until then. If you want to spend bitcoin, go to purse.io and spend bitcoin. But keep in mind that bitcoin's still just a $6billion market and most people aren't using it.

I like the idea of private, decentralized money, and bitcoin is probably the best yet. Gold is good too, but it's more expensive to secure and can't be sent globally for $0.07. The benefit is that it's proven itself and it works easily without the internet.
I say buy both. Bitcoin doesn't feel like a risky investment to me. Investing in conventional finance seems riskier. That said, once this stock bubble pops, I'll begin investing there and from then on, I'm going to use Harry Browne's permanent portfolio strategy with some of my own tweaks (i.e. replace some of the cash with crypto).
It's very exciting times if you're paying attention, but seriously, if bitcoin seems like the riskiest investment to you, then you should be interesting elsewhere.

I think it would be more convenient to use one currency as a store of wealth and a cheap method of payment. Bitcoin is better than gold in that it's cheaper to store and transfer (albeit not as shiny) and it's better than dollars in that it's predictably deflationary, decentralized and is backed by solid tech.

Yes, you will be able to sell those 2 on both forks. But the coins on one fork should very quickly have their value reduced to zero.

it's important for you to accept each other and nurture each other's passions. 
I've been married for 42 years and have gone through couples therapy for proactive maintenance, and this is one of the most important things I've learned. It's very frustrating when your life partner tries to stifle your passions. 
That said, you need to respect her too. I would advise against compromising your passions because you could build resentment, but also I think it might be a good idea to negotiate with her and come to an agreement on how much to invest in Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is the future but so is your marriage =)

Bitcoin doesn't need to fail for another cryptocurrency to take its place. If the market decides that a competitor is better than bitcoin, they'll just move their money around and the bitcoin market will gradually shrink.
That said, it would be very difficult to displace the first mover with 7 years of network effects.

Ethereum isn't meant to compete with bitcoin anyway, so why would this matter?

He says that government can't tax bitcoin and you say they can. I'm still on the fence, but if he didn't support his claim, then you definitely didn't, so why call him out on it?
I think that governments can technically tax bitcoin, but it would be more difficult. They can certainly still force merchants to charge sales tax, but once bitcoin has a method for increased anonymity (i.e. BIP47's reusable payment codes), it will become very difficult to know who owns what.

My nightmares usually have scary monsters and super creeps. I've never had a dream about a 51% attack and it really isn't something I'm concerned about in waking life either. Some people are worried about free-market monopolies, but I don't think it's much of a concern as long as there's competition and voluntarism involved in the market. If the Chinese government cracks down on miners, then mining will have to move elsewhere. On the other hand, I'm not sure what would happen if the Chinese government took control of the mining companies and tried to attack the network. I may have some nightmares about this tonight...if I can fall asleep in the first place.
@_date: 2016-03-09 16:46:32
You can, but it's my understanding that the word "bitcoin" is both singular and plural when referring to a non-specific amount. It's completely aesthetic though and you can say whatever you want.
In my opinion, saying 3.4 bitcoins sounds better, but "a bunch of bitcoins" doesn't sound right. I think it's because you're referring to an exact amount.

Because it would satisfy people who want an increase in block size. I mean, 100% consensus isn't really possible, but what's the point of bitcoin classic if core sticks a block size cap increase in a hard fork that they're already going to implement.
In fact, I think it would be a huge slap in the face if core pushed for a hard fork and didn't include the 2mb bump. This is obviously just my opinion, but I think other people would share it.
@_date: 2016-03-09 13:42:53
No I don't rely on benevolence. I think that in most free market economies, the incentives of maintaining/advancing the network have a positive effect on everyone. When manufacturers fight to lower cost, the consumers benefit from lower cost products. Hell, even the employees who may receive lower wages at least benefit from cheaper goods in other sectors.
If miners are naturally incentivized to harm the network, that's a problem. I think it would be better if the block size cap could be removed without destroying bitcoin, but I guess if there are other ways to scale the network, then everything could work out just fine.
Keep in mind that I don't understand the technicalities underlying bitcoin, so I'm just going off of what seems logical to me economically. I'm always happy to hear the counterpoints.

I dislike bullying tactics too, but a lot of the bitcoin community is confused about the conflict, and I think it would be okay to appease the part of the community that wishes for 2mb blocks. I'm not technically inclined, but a raise from 1mb to 2mb doesn't seem like a big deal.
There's something to be said about the value of putting a community at ease. It would be helpful if your average bitcoin joe knew that the core developers are acting in the best interest of bitcoin's growth. 
I'm a capitalist and so I sometimes feel like siding with the classic crowd, but I know nothing about the technical side of things, so I prefer to stay out of the debate and just ask questions to try to figure things out. 
It would help me if the core developers had a marketing push to communicate with non-technical bitcoin evangelists and bitcoin customers. Ideally, the bitcoin businesses would be doing the marketing, but it usually seems like the conflict is developers vs. businesses, or coders vs. salespeople.

Thanks for the answers. Yes, I know that not everyone agrees on a hard fork. In fact, it seems like most of the developers are against it. I was suggesting it as a hypothetical.
So, for the block size cap, are you saying that block size cap and block size are the same? Is there an incentive for miners to max out the block size at the expense of the network? If it's a problem to have very large blocks, then why world miners piss everyone off for more transaction fees? After all, each fee is only a few pennies.

Depending on how much money you have in bitcoin, there are different levels of security you might like to use. For more security, make sure you use a wallet that allows you to control your private keys.
iOS: I hear breadwallet is very good
Android: I use and love mycelium
PC: electrum is excellent
If you want even more security, consider looking into paper wallets or hardware wallets. These allow you to keep your private keys off the internet.

Climate change isn't a problem that can be solved. It's existed constantly throughout the Earth's history and it was happening well before the industrial revolution.

@_date: 2016-03-08 23:33:15
This is why I think that the cap should be raised to 2mb if the core team is already going to implement a hard fork at some point. It's important for bitcoin to resist change so that it can't be subverted by the state, but if everyone agrees on a hard fork, what's the problem with it?
One thing that I still don't understand is the reason for the block size cap...
Satoshi implemented it initially because it was fairly cheap to spam the network to death, right? Why is it important to keep the cap so low at this point?
@_date: 2016-03-11 21:32:59

Yeah, this debt based money that we've been forced to use allows government and citizens to spend beyond their means. The fact that the US gov't is trillions of dollars in debt means that they've spent (potentially) years worth of funds that they can't afford. And then all the unfunded liabilities means that they're promising the citizens that they will rape the planet even more in the near future.
Marxist environmentalists aren't actually seeking constructive action toward environmental protection. They just want to ruffle feathers, increase state power, and divide the country.
If they truly cared and if they were honourable people, they wouldn't tolerate this debt-based monetary system. The problem is that they're largely a bunch of unthinkers that prefer rioting over debate.
@_date: 2016-01-05 20:04:49
I think the idea is that by 2140, the bitcoin network will have enough activity to support miners with fees. My thought has always been that mining will become more decentralized when the rewards dry up unless there's enough money in fees to run an industry, but this really isn't my area of expertise.
That said, if I just go with my imagination, I could see the millions or billions of bitcoin users maintaining the network with their personal devices, whatever form those may take 100 years from now. With the price of bitcoin having reached its potential, there will be enough wealth in the blockchain to maintain its integrity.

You have a good point there. But is there any way to make bitcoin wallets recoverable without making transactions reversible or breaking the encryption? I think that the best way to do this is to buy a trezor, but if you want something completely foolproof and fully insured, you need to trust your funds to a 3rd party.
I lost my password once, and 7.5btc along with it. Fortunately, it was only worth about $200 at the time, but I learned my lesson. Since then, with HD wallets, it's much easier and I haven't lost any bitcoin since. The problem is that people don't take their bitcoin wallet seriously. It's really not that hard to keep a 12-word seed safe and backed up.
Trezor is solving the problem as we speak. If you want to keep your bitcoin safe and low-stress, buy a trezor.

Bitcoin is a great way to store wealth. You can sell it anytime on local bitcoins, so there's no benefit to keeping your money as inflationary currency.
Bitcoin is only a $17 billion dollar market and it's going to be huge.   
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:19:27
That's okay if you disagree. The internet was too difficult for most people to use too. Making lost bitcoin recoverable isn't a priority to anyone. If you want someone to take care of you, yes, you're going to have to use a 3rd party. Although, you've probably noticed that it's become way easier to back up your coins over the past several years. HD wallets have made everything easier. At this point, if you lose your bitcoin permanently, and you can't figure out how it could have been prevented, you should stay away from it for awhile.
What sort of solution are you hoping for?
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:21:23
That's a feature, not a bug. A bank-like company could try to come along and take care of people who have trouble keeping their money.
Bitcoin's like cash. If you lose it, it's gone. For that reason, some people don't like to carry cash. Bitcoin isn't for people who aren't responsible or don't trust themselves. They can use credit cards or entrust their money with a 3rd party.

It's the network effect. There's 7 years of infrastructure backing bitcoin, it has the most mining power (i.e. security), etc. It could be replaced, but if you're interested in crypto, bitcoin is it right now.

@_date: 2016-06-03 14:34:21
The leftist government is only interested in getting more power over your money and your life. I airways recommend buying off localbitcoins or quickbt.com if you're in Canada. Use cash for less friction and more freedom.

I want to keep buying more, so let's us smart people keep bitcoin quiet for a little while longer. Besides, your average pleb has very little interest in actually buying it. They don't understand the world enough to care. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 13:38:55
If you buy one, you will generate private keys and a backup (list of random words). From there, you'll just send your bitcoin to one of the public keys your ledger wallet produces.
This would be a great option for long term storage. Just make sure you keep the backup safe.

There wasn't a lot of price movement last time. But shortly after, the price went up from $12 to $200. Maybe the price lags the decrease in inflation. We'll just have to find out.

No no, I would actually say you're a nihilist if you don't support Trump, not necessarily a communist. 
I'd prefer to live in a stateless society too, but we don't have that option. We have to live in reality, and the reality is that Trump is clearly going to decrease the size of the state way more than Clinton.

KYC/AML is a legal scam. Even if the company is lawful, they can still very easily screw you. This is what bitcoin is meant to prevent so everyone should take this as a lesson and use unregulated exchanges. Or buy with cash!
@_date: 2016-06-16 13:17:47
KYC/AML is the evidence. I used fake information when I set up my Bitgold account so that I could just see what it's all about. I was hoping I could use it anonymously with bitcoin, but that's not allowed. When I decided to add my real information, they told me I had to call customer service to do it. 
Even if they provide good service, bitcoin is way better than gold as a digital asset. Gold is a physical asset, and serves that purpose very well.

Yes, It is indeed discrimination. Trump absolutely favors Americans over Mexicans and Muslims. Go figure. It's not like he's the leader of America or anything.

@_date: 2016-06-21 13:20:33
Meh, I'm not selling. If I had Fiat left over, I'd probably buy more. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 15:16:20
Put your money where you're confident putting it. Dollars are for spending. Bitcoin is for saving. You could have $5 in fiat savings right now and you'd still be fine as long as you have a job.  
Don't forget you can sell your bitcoin any time.   
@_date: 2017-01-03 05:24:50
I got lucky and for some reason didn't buy any bitcoin during the bubble. Maybe I was too broke or something.
But yeah, 2014 was a boring year. Great buying opportunity though. 2014 was the year I bought a trezor and started selling off my fiat currency.

Although, the rise of bitcoin is equivalent to a Japan that's just discovering that they can buy and sell real estate. At first, the market is worth nothing, but it grows into a multi-trillion dollar industry as the Japanese people learn the benefit of owning buildings.
A modern real-estate bubble is due to rampant money printing and capital flight. And of course there are other factors, but for the most part, real estate bubbles are no stranger to inflation.

The Berlin Wall divided Germany. The MAGA wall is a barrier between America and Mexico. It's more similar to Israel's border wall. The border exists for a reason, and the wall will improve it.
For the sake of European existence, I hope that America's nationalism (as well as Hungary's and Poland's) leaks into your part of the world. Otherwise, try your best to survive life in a 10%+ Muslim country.

It's better in some ways too. 
- storage is free and security is tight
- cheap to send (virtually instantly) all around the world
- Infinitely divisible on the spot
Now all we need is a robust way to use bitcoin offline. I like what OpenDime is doing but I think we need more. If the power is out and you don't have any cash or silver/gold, you can't access your money. I don't want to rely on internet and electricity availability.

The twentieth century was only brutal because communists were trying to take over. The nationalist regimes fought back, but unfortunately, the communists won, and millions of people died because of that. 
I love bitcoin because I'm pro-freedom, but bitcoin isn't worth very much unless the freedom-loving cultures (i.e. White European and American) maintain their strength. 
I don't give a shit about bitcoin if my city is invaded by Sharia-lovers like what's happening in London. Bitcoin is an incredibly important invention for the future, but love of western civilization comes first. If enough Muslims/Mexicans move into New York City, New York City becomes Syria/Mexico.
You can call Syrian "refugees" doctors and engineers all you want, but Muslim countries are still dominated by Sharia Law (i.e. pedophilia wife beaters). You'll see what happens if enough Europeans are like you. But America will become stronger, despite your autism.

My point is that there's a fair bit of interest in Bitcoin and small markets are more volatile. You can't really compare Bitcoin's volatility to most other markets because a relatively small amount of money can cause price swings.

Thanks for explaining it. I definitely think that it's a nicer looking device and it will be good for trezor to have  competition. But as a trezor owner, I don't yet see value in buying another hardware wallet.

I just read an article by vitalik buterin on public vs private blockchains and I get it now. The blockchain is a consensus network. If a bank or group of banks creates a private blockchain then they can improve their consensus network and reduce cost.

To be fair, gold's value is hugely affected by all the paper (i.e. fake) gold floating around. If people lose confidence in the US dollar, there could be a default in the gold market that leads to a massive price appreciation.
If this sounds crazy and deters people from buying gold, then I'm really not too bothered. 
The same goes for Bitcoin. If people don't yet see its value, then I'm okay with that. Part of its value is that it separates economy and state. Does that sound crazy too? Oh well...
@_date: 2015-08-05 17:00:18
Yep the mainstream media is still behind. It's difficult for them to understand that the ledger entries are intimately tied with Bitcoin, and without a cryptocurrency, the blockchain doesn't actually exist.

It doesn't work yet. It would have been nice if they announced it after it was fully implemented...
@_date: 2015-08-05 20:17:23
They could do that, but the beauty of blockchain tech is that it decentralizes the maintenance cost. What would be the benefit of them running their own miners and nodes? If one party controls all the miners, what's the benefit?
Of course I could be wrong, so I'm open to suggestions. One idea is that they could create an altcoin for their bank and run all transactions through that network. If it has value, then people will mine.

Why don't they take shortcuts now with the current limit? If I'm a miner, can I just confirm a few transactions and then close the block?

No, I respect it for its strong community and unique branding. There are also things I don't like about it, but it's clear that it has value. That said, it would be nice if the inflation wasn't so high. I think it would be better with a value of about 10 cents per coin, but that's just my preference.

That's true, but how much will the big block miner be affected by a higher orphan rate? Are bigger blocks always more profitable? If that's the case, if we removed the cap, how big do you think miners would make their blocks? Where do you think the equilibrium would be?

That's not centralization though. Bitcoin banking could become a very lucrative industry. There will definitely be competition for coinbase. 
Decentralization just means that no one can manipulate the fundamentals of the currency. No one can't print Bitcoin and if you destroy them you're only hurting yourself.
What you're talking about is just a slight centralization in that everyone will put their trust in a central trustworthy group of companies.

Oops, I meant that you take 7mb worth of transactions, negating my work. So now I have to start again on a new block.
If there's little incentive for miners to process transactions, then surely the fees need to increase as the block rewards decrease.
@_date: 2016-02-29 18:37:20
Thanks for the answer! Now I'm stuck on propagation. Could you quickly let me know the basic path that miners take to complete a block? If you don't want to, do you know of anything I could read to get the basic outline of mining?

@_date: 2016-02-24 16:35:51
This is one of those arguments for central planning. The supply and demand are determined most efficiently by the free market. The transaction cost will rise gradually as the block reward decreases.
I still don't understand why we want to artificially constrict the supply to forcefully increase tx fees. If anyone can explain how this makes sense economically, I'm eager to hear it.
As of now, I'm unconvinced that centrally planning bitcoin's supply is a good idea. But if there's a technicality that affects bitcoin's economics, please let me know.
@_date: 2016-02-24 16:31:05
I get that fees will eventually need to replace block rewards as the main incentive to mine, but why do we need to force a fee market at this point?
Wouldn't a fee market emerge naturally, based on decreasing block rewards, changes in transaction volume, etc.?
I can understand why a lot of people want bigger blocks to allow more transactions with smaller fees while the network is still being subsidized by inflation.
@_date: 2015-07-06 13:23:09
How would you know the difference between a p&amp;d and an actual price rise. Bitcoin has actual value so ultimately, it pumps itself. Especially with the bond bubble that needs to pop eventually, hard assets like Bitcoin and gold have clear value.

Of course they understand that. You need to have fiat money for spending, but it's counter-productive to save in fiat. Your wealth gets diluted. 
I don't want to spend bitcoin unless I get a discount. That's because I'm speculating on a higher future price and it costs me a fee to buy bitcoin from a trader. That's why I use bitcoin as a speculative savings account.

@_date: 2016-02-24 21:14:21
I agree. It's the block size cap that is an example of central planning. Nobody knows what the supply of network resources should be. The only way to set the supply is by considering the transaction cost, mining cost, block reward, etc.
The block reward + tx fees need to cover the cost and provide profit to the miners, but there doesn't seem to be any good reason to forcefully increase fees by reducing supply while the network cost is being subsidized by inflation.

The non-technical bitcoin users certainly can't tell the core developers what to do. It's not a democracy, but they should still listen to their customers to a certain extent.
It's just that non-technical users should shutup about the technical intricacies of bitcoin development and stick to demanding features so that developers know what they want. And if the developers refuse to satisfy their customers, then maybe other developers can take over.
The concern with hardforks with less than 90% consensus makes sense to me. We don't want bitcoin to be co-opted by corporatist/statist interests, because it is in their best interest to squash alternative money technology.
I would love it if the developers were more open with us, but I'm very hesitant about passing bitcoin's reigns off to a new team because I like what the developers have done so far. 
Politics are complicated and counter productive, but there's no way to avoid it in the creation of new money. This work will make the state way less powerful and they can't be happy about that. If they can't control the money supply, then their size and power must contract. It won't be pretty for them, but whatever, they're a bunch of parasites.
@_date: 2016-02-29 16:39:47
"Big miners actually benefit by slow propagation due to the same effects in selfish mining"
I'm not sure what this means. Wouldn't small block miners be able to complete blocks faster (depending on their hash power), causing the big block miners to experience a higher orphan rate? Also, what do you mean by the "effects of selfish mining"? Isn't mining always selfish since they're trying to profit from their work?
As mining becomes less profitable, it seems that it would naturally become more centralized. Already, I can't mine on my CPU and so mining requires a great accumulation of resources...a 'centralization' of resources. Do you think that centralization is a bad thing? I just want to see competition in mining, and I think that the ideal block size could be found by competing miners, as long as the proper incentives have been built into the network. 
Last thing, what does it mean to get edges?
Thanks for answering my questions. I'm really trying to understand the block size cap.
@_date: 2016-02-13 08:31:25
Any thoughts on how mining would look as a service?
@_date: 2016-02-29 03:24:44
Well, it was a measure against spam at first as we all know. But obviously, there's still some reason why it continues on, fallacious or not. Here's what someone else told me about why we need the cap:
"Miners will accept the biggest blocks possible. But now only a few people are able to validate those blocks as valid. This means that only the biggest miners will be able to determine if it is valid or not. This means you now have to trust third parties to tell you what is on the blockchain rather than figure it yourself."
So it seems that this person thinks that miners are incentivized to capture as many fees as possible, but I don't fully understand the position. Here's my response below. Do you have any thoughts on this?
"Why will miners mine the biggest block possible? Aren't there benefits of mining smaller blocks too? For example, what if one pool sets their block size at 10mb and another sets theirs at 7mb? How would that play out?"
My thought is that if I want to mine a 10mb block and then you come along and include some of those transactions into a 7mb block, wouldn't you be out-competing me with a smaller block size?
Or am I over-simplifying the process?
@_date: 2016-09-14 04:35:22
It's like any asset. You can buy it in a lump sum or you can dollar cost average your way in. Decide how much money you want to invest, and then do it.
You should get a hardware wallet. I'd recommend the bitcoin trezor. Then, make sure you remember your password/pin, and write your backup in a very safe place.
Practice sending bitcoin transactions to get the hang of it before you buy thousands of dollars worth.

Collapse of anything is possible. That's why you diversify. The only problem is that all non-crypto assets (aside from gold) rely on a third party, and I trust nobody but myself, Satoshi, and the jewish god of precious metals.
Also, I disagree that it's irresponsible to base my assets on bitcoin. It's high risk, and that's how I roll, bud.

Using bitcoin for payments would result from mass adoption. We need the infrastructure to continue being built and we need the price to go up to drive adoption. 
Unless you're a bitcoin developer, the best thing you could do is sell your dollars for bitcoin. Bring more money into the network. Spend it if you'd like, but since you have to buy above spot, the incentives are against spending it. 
Edit: Also, increased liquidity would be helpful.

No, central planning is about forcing people to act in a certain way. Bitcoin is about making finance jobs obsolete. Not to mention, no forced redistribution of wealth.

Conventional finance wastes the most precious resource of all -- human capital. Think of all the people employed by Banks. They could be doing something more useful than processing transactions. They could be creating or building something. 
And yes, everyone knows that bitcoin hasn't scaled yet. Be patient. Eventually it will be part of a financial system that's far more ethical than what we have.
And last thing I'll mention (you asshole), far less wasteful than the fiat debt system we're currently suffering under.

That's not true. Spend them if you feel like it, but it's cheaper to spend dollars. 
Spending bitcoin is the equivalent of selling bitcoin. Saving is what will increase the price because by saving, you're taking some bitcoin out of the supply pool.

That's an important question. When you create your wallet, it gives you a series of 24 words (called a "seed"). If your trezor breaks, you can use this seed to restore your wallet on another trezor or some other wallet softwares such as mycelium.

@_date: 2015-04-22 13:59:36
Thanks for the response! That's a lot to take in, but here are my initial thoughts.
So after the price crashes, would it become useful as a currency again? It sounds like deflation is a good incentive to save. It's a good thing that Bitcoin is infinitely divisible and cheap to transfer. 
I like to save and deflation would further incentivise that, but I can't eat Bitcoin so I would be forced to spend it. I would just try to put more into savings.

You can worry if you want, but yes, Bitcoin is new and it's a very interesting technology with sound code. The way economies grow is by making certain industries obsolete and freeing up resources. Bitcoin could do this for finance.

Either way, he should look to the Red Cross for guidance. They promote their brand while helping people without seeming 'disgusting'.
That said, I'm not disgusted by this. It's not a big deal, but in a free market charity environment, you can think whatever you want. 
Edit: I'd also expect people that post on the buttcoin sub to be disgusted by this, but without provocation, I'm not sure that your average person (i.e. doesn't know or care about bitcoin) would be bothered. Buttcoiners are extra soft and easy to upset. ;)

I've heard of you and I've used your service once, but since I'm in Canada and our dollar is shit, when I deposited my $5 worth of bitcoin, I got only $5.03CAD. That's the downside of a weak dollar. I prefer bitcoin. Your site was very easy to use. The only thing I'd prefer is a mobile app and more options for stores. If you could somehow make it so Canadians get savings too, that would be very nice :)
I can't speak for others, but I trusted your site enough to deposit $5 right off the bat. I just wanted to test it out.

Let's say Bitcoin replaces the dollar and the price increases. All of a sudden, people with savings have more money. I can't speak for everyone, but if the value of my savings increased, I'd also spend more. If it continues to go up, then I'll be able to spend more and more. I'm really only trying to save money so I can spend money on bigger things.
You're right that not everyone can just save without producing anything, but you need to get paid somehow. Also, some people are interested in getting very wealthy. Deflation of their currency may not get them where they want to be. 
The price can't just increase forever. It's only worth what people are willing to pay for it.

We need a magic 8 ball to settle this because otherwise, no one knows what will happen. I'm looking at the features of Bitcoin tech and I see value so I speculate.
How do you know the amount of buyable stuff wouldn't increase? The price of Bitcoin isn't going to skyrocket over night and not everyone has Bitcoin. Only a relative few would increase their savings. Deflation would increase the price further only gradually and the economy isn't going to just stop. Who knows what's going to happen? This is why we need empirical evidence. There are just too many factors to make a conclusion either way.
I'm just speculating based on my perceived value of Bitcoin.

Both spending and saving make a strong economy, but I don't get people referring to saving bitcoin as though it's a bad thing. I value it as a store of wealth more than I value the dollar but when the market grows and people start trading bitcoin more often, I'll definitely want to spend my coins. 
When I can pay rent and buy food in bitcoin, I'll spend, and I don't see the bitcoin ecosystem slowing down for that reason. Right now, relatively few people are saving anything in the American economy, and that's because they're not very wealthy.
I'm not an economist so please feel free to prove me wrong, but if you just want to point out that I "have that completely backwards", then I think you should shut your mouth. That said, I'm completely open to correction.

@_date: 2015-04-22 14:28:31
Hmm...I would think that the market would reach an equilibrium between investment and savings. The price goes up and people save, then the price goes down and people invest. Sometimes money is more expensive but it fluctuates.
An inflationary currency like the dollar doesn't seem to reach equilibrium though. It's not so easy to remove money from the money supply. Isn't that why the value has dropped by 99%since its inception? 
What would you say are the ideal characteristics of a currency?

Food is still more expensive. It's just that if you subsidize junk food, what do you think poor people are gonna buy? Good food is still getting more expensive. Go to the grocery store. It's way more expensive than it was 10 years ago. If the price of computers is decreasing because of REAL WORLD IMPROVEMENT!!!! (I don't know how to bold), then why the hell isn't farming technology improving? It's weird. 
A free market starts with a free market of currency. Bitcoin is very nice because for the first time, there's a choice. You're right, I could try to start using the Ruble instead of the CAD, but it's really all the same shit. It's all based on the health of the USD and it's all state controlled fiat.
It's so cool that we can disagree on this now. Before bitcoin, there was really only one currency option per country. If you're right, then bitcoin won't work. The dollar doesn't work, and so it's failing. The same could happen to any currency. 
When I refer to a free market, I'm referring to one where there's a choice. It's especially important that we're able to choose which currency we use. Decentralized, centralized, inflationary, non-inflationary, and any other option you can think of. The government has made it ILLEGAL!!! for us to transact in alternate currencies for so long and we finally have a choice. You can argue against bitcoin all you want. It's a FREE COUNTRY!!!

That's a great solution to use a different google account and I definitely get where you're coming from.
Based on what I've been reading, the r/bitcoin community will complain to you about how they want to decentralize your service (and that will likely happen sometime), but gamers won't give a shit, so this is great. I want to play Smite for bitcoin. Please make that happen :D.
Edit: Oh, one more question. Is your blockchain algorithm open source? I'm not a developer, but it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy when centralized services let the internet audit them. It's not necessary once that company's built their reputation, but I'm just wondering about your approach. I wouldn't expect a small company to show that card early on, but as you grow and fill your hands with more cards, the software becomes a smaller part of what you offer.
Edit for another: Instead of showing +10 when you get a kill in Call of Duty, do you think one day it might say +10B(itcoin logo)?

@_date: 2015-04-21 20:33:20
I'm surprised there were no fees. The biggest reason I'm into Bitcoin is that it's decentralized. Theoretically, its super easy to transfer and retains value like gold.
It doesn't sound like Bitcoin would have been faster for you though.
@_date: 2015-09-24 19:36:07
Yes, because Bitcoin depends on centralized services! No, but seriously, don't listen to this guy. If you want to buy with Bitcoin, your options are limited right now because the market is tiny and not many people care about Bitcoin at this point. That will likely change because Bitcoin is a stellar currency for online transactions.
@_date: 2015-04-15 13:47:45
Only a small proportion of people are willing to speculate. The technology needs to become useful before people will buy in. 
If you're talking about selling the idea of Bitcoin to speculators, then maybe some work needs to be done, but the long term value is in the usefulness of the network.
I'll go read your other thread now, but please feel free to reply.
Edit: I agree that price is the driving factor for adoption right now, but I think that practical use for the masses will need to become the main driver instead of speculation if we're to see long term growth. I think this will happen with all the money being invested in Bitcoin and blockchain companies. Building value in a company without IPO bullshit is a long process, and it looks like the same will be true for Bitcoin.

It takes some time for Bitcoin companies to create products and services to attract new users. Right now there's very little incentive for most people to invest in Bitcoin... What would they use it for? Gold is a more proven store of value and PayPal is quite sufficient for transferring money online.
Bitcoin will not appreciate in value for no reason, but there are millions of dollars being invested in the ecosystem. We'll see if the potential is realized.

I went to open an account but the bank closed at 4 so I came back the next day. I signed up online so I only had to sign some forms. The in-branch customer service was great, but I had to deal with the telephone customer service because they put a hold on my account.

In that case, I'm unclear on the benefits. Can anyone else explain?
@_date: 2015-04-22 03:56:28
I'm just comparing currencies ("mediums of exchange ") and I prefer being able to retain my wealth, at the very least. I'd rather not lose value on my cash due to inflation. Sure, I could buy gold or something else that's historically maintained value, but it's not as convenient to store as Bitcoin.
You make good points though. 
Edit: what I actually want to know is what characteristics u prefer in a currency. Any thoughts?
I hope all my edits didn't throw you off. I'm typing on my phone so editing can be laborious...

3 tps is not permanent, but you're right that the *real* use cases are short right now. But banks are going to have to downsize once people realize that they're not needed for storing money at 0% interest anymore. In the long run, Bitcoin beats inflation, so it's potentially a very safe investment. Bitcoin's potential is in its strong technology and its nature as an economically sound money.
I'm not distorting reality. I understand that Bitcoin has a ton of potential, but I'm certainly not taking out a mortgage based on projected ROI.
@_date: 2015-09-25 02:42:14
This idea has so much potential. If it lands on the major consoles, it's gonna make games incredibly appealing. I think there's going to soon be a market for open source gaming consoles, because there's no way that Microsoft or Sony would get away with adding 'gambling' to their consoles. 
I'm curious...how do you store/transfer coins on your network? Is it p2p or does it go through you?
Edit for another question: Does it require a google account to sign up?
Edit for yet another: Are the transactions off chain? This could easily drive more traffic toward bitcoin. Video games are huge and I bet tons of people would much rather be playing them for money. Oh man, this is going to burst open the market for gaming skill. Mind blown.
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:26:08

Nice, I finally got quoted on that silly satire sub. I'm not involved in charity and I'll leave it to the experts, but if it was possible to donate money to a family, I think that would be great.
I don't care what kind of money is donated, it's nice either way. Bitcoin users want to donate bitcoin because it makes them happy to help people using a technology that they care about. I realize that this may not be a practical way to help, but if this is a problem for anyone, then quite frankly, you can go suck a lemon.
That angry satirist that quoted me... I hope he/she is donating to this cause. Otherwise you can go suck a really sour lemon... And maybe something else too. ;)
I think you people are getting angry over petty bullshit. Don't sweat the small stuff or you'll go bald and get ulcers. I'll happily donate some bitcoin for your hair transplant if you're nice, but you're on your own for the ulcers.
And yes, I'm aware that I'm being passive aggressive.

You're right. Spending and consuming doesn't grow the economy, but if people are able to more easily save their money, then they can more easily invest in businesses. If the amount of deflation is greater than the amount that can be made by starting or investing in a successful business, then you're absolutely right that something needs to change.

Deflation is always bad? What about computers and other similar types of technology that are always going down in price? 
I would definitely like everything to get cheaper. It would make sense for things like food to get cheaper as technology improves, but instead the opposite is happening because of subsidies and inflation and shit like that. I'm just thinking about my best interest. A boy's gotta eat, ya know?
The reason that I think a decentralized currency is ideal is because the government doesn't allow a free market of money. So they can take down any centralized competitors, but they can't take down something with no single point of failure. That's why this whole thing is so exciting. You might be right, but I'm super interested because anything would be better than a currency that's forced upon the entire population.

I also thought "why not both?" when he was saying that we need to make a choice. I definitely think that the cap should be removed. It only seems like a necessary restriction if you ignore the fact that supply and demand always reach equilibrium in the market. Unless of course the supply or demand are manipulated (i.e. block size cap artificially restricts supply and prohibition artificially restricts demand).
These rules of economics were put forward and proven over a 100 years ago. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 02:31:08
That's really interesting. Maybe they failed along the way, but if they did, why would they have priced their product so high?

Even if Bitcoin is intangible code, it's still scarce and it's still property. It's definitely theft. That said, its not like the police prevent theft anyway so it won't  stop thieves from thieving. But prople want to prevent the loss of their assets, so they'll demand protection.
Any Bitcoin company with insured security will be much more popular if Bitcoin becomes competitive with fiat currency. I could see insured companies like Circle et al. Providing a valuable service...
That is, until something better comes along...maybe open source security built into the wallet... Seeing what happens is the exciting part. Bitcoin is such a new and unrefined technology.

The ledger is open but how will the state find out who owns which address? HD wallets make it very difficult and the burden of proof is much higher than a bank account with your name tied to it.
The blockchain may be open ledger but it's still way more private from the eye of sauron/government than your bank account.

No one is claiming that Bitcoin is a completely safe investment. The price is volatile and you can lose your money just by forgetting your password or having your hard drive fail. Only invest in Bitcoin if you think the technology has value. If you think that free market money is superior to the fiat currencies that we're all forced to use, then Bitcoin is a really interesting investment.
Also, don't invest in mining unless you have the capital to invest in an entire warehouse full of active miners.

Rarity is a feature that turns Bitcoin into an effective store of wealth. I agree with you, but I'm not concerned. He can think whatever he wants. The supply cap is somewhat random, but if the network agrees to increase it, they are agreeing to reduce their Bitcoin wealth. Even if the miners would like to increase the cap, they have to consider the users' opinions or risk their business.

There's lower risk for sure, but the greatest aggressor in the world (USA) already has so much debt. I get that there's lower risk when the borrower has a gigantic military and can hang the taxpayer upsidedown until all his money's been extracted, but what if a country has $18 trillion of debt already, with only $3 trillion in annual revenue? Eventually its unsustainability becomes so obvious that only fools continue to lend.
This is my take and why I understand that debt cannot pile up forever without pissing off the lenders.

Fiat currency works best for spending but it's not so good for saving money because of the unpredictable inflation rate and because it's debt-based. Bitcoin has a predictable inflation rate so that your wealth will not be leeched away by central banks.

The people that are spending dollars and saving bitcoin are actually driving the price of bitcoin up. Then we have the speculative traders who buy and sell, and this increases the liquidity so that anyone can enter the market quite easily. Obviously it's not as liquid as gold. You can't buy $20billion in bitcoin at any one time or even at all right now.
Fiat is a corrupt ponzi-scheme. Right now it's quite useful and people are generally happy with their dollars. They spend all their time accumulating them and simultaneously, they shun scarce moneys like gold or bitcoin. This is actually because they know dick all about economics. 
It's okay for the economic-illiterate to laugh at bitcoin right now. They're just not knowledgeable or smart enough to care about such things. However, they'll be forced to confront reality when their government's house of cards comes crashing down and all the bitcoin enthusiasts and goldbugs are comparatively wealthy.
I see absolutely no problem in the wealth concentration of bitcoin. This is how it has to happen. There is no "fair" way to distribute wealth equally. That's called communism. Absent government interference, capitalism is a meritocracy. Only the wealthy and intelligent have the foresight to invest in bitcoin and gold right now while the dollar is strong. 
This will result in a wealth redistribution to the intelligent. That's a good thing. Increased "velocity of flow" will come when the bitcoin network grows. Wealth concentration is not a bad thing, especially when there are more than enough satoshis for everyone to grab a piece when they're ready.

Bitcoin is a safer bet right now. Until ethereum proves itself as a store of value, or proves itself useful to consumers, I don't trust it enough to invest. And because I'm not invested, I don't much care if it succeeds or fails. 
The free market is competitive as all hell, and it's not un-libertarian to choose a brand. Ethereum is a risky bet right now, and I'm fairly slow to trust. Bitcoin has proven itself to me as a store as wealth and I find its monetary policy is much more predictable. 
Maybe I'm just a dinosaur, but if I was a dinosaur, I wouldn't be so invested in bitcoin.

But the thing is, people don't like telemarketers. If bitcoin was sexy, it wouldn't be sold over the phone. Its investors would instead run a gorilla marketing campaign or something. 
Once the fiats start noticeably losing value, then people will see the gorilla ads promoting bitcoin and their curiosity will pique.

Many people like to plan their purchases and ensure that they're getting the best deals. I'd definitely prefer to see the deals ahead of time so I have a chance to consider them. I want to make sure I'm getting the best deals - bitcoins or dollars.
