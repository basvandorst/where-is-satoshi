Exciting times ahead! My original entry point was mid December, just bought twice as much as my original investment. See you on the moon ��

It’s definitely going to, either, go up, down or sideways. You’re welcome.

What are your thoughts on Bitfinex? In my country they have a very user friendly app so it would be easy to trade while away from home. (Crypto noob, redditor for 2 weeks and bitcoin hodler)������

I hope so, been hodling for long enough and buying the dips. 
Do you think there’s a surge coming? Tired of this slow bleeding out.
