They don't give you any ability to specify fees when you sell or buy. :/ 
I'm guessing the guy who has my case just doesn't know what he's doing or has never seen this bug before because the canned response he gave me was entirely unrelated.

Interesting, is this risky? I see lots of people offering to deposit cash in an account. Seems pretty quick and painless.
@_date: 2014-01-10 13:52:42
Tacit as in acknowledging without actually offering to do anything. Something to the effect of: "It's happened 4 times in a row? Cool story bro, let us know if it keeps happening."

Does Bitstamp work for US accounts? Will I actually be able to get my money out?

Yeah good point! Been ready to flee this country for a while. Maybe Bitcoin will push me over the edge.

I received the same. I also wonder how they got my email. Was Coinbase hacked?
The most troubling part is the email headers make it look legit:

Seems like Russia is a market that's ripe for this sort of thing. In Russia, every street corner has a little terminal where you can feed in cash to pay bills, top up your mobile, etc. They print a little receipt that could even have a QR code on it. The terminals are run by just a handful of providers. So if one or two of those providers added bitcoin to the myriad of payment options, it could add hundreds of thousands of physical bitcoin purchase locations.

I've had zero issues with Coinbase so far. Buying, selling, transferring in or out.

My company opened a merchant account and they gave this to us. There's nothing confidential about this. Any business who opens a merchant account will be provided this.
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:31:59
There's no way to know if fit was exchanged for this though, right? Could be someone moving from one wallet to another?

Think of it differently:
Let's say I will probably buy a Subway sandwich next week. I can buy $5 worth of Bitcoin today. And assuming Bittcoin rises in value between then and now then I won't have to spend all of that Bitcoin to buy the sandwich.
Putting aside the risk that Bitcoin will go down, there's very little reason I would NOT want to pay with Bitcoin by first purchasing the Bitcoin I need with USD.
It's for this reason that I'm seeking out vendors who accept Bitcoin for as many of my day-to-day purchase as I can.

Here in New York City they are actually pretty good. Big Box stores are rare and harder to get to. Radio Shack is everywhere in neighborhoods and is a good place to go for headphones, accessories, and such when you can't wait for shipping.

I imagine Visa also did not do 6,000 transactions per second when it was introduced in the 60's.

You can tell it's shopped because the coins are too new-looking. After holding into my bitcoins for so long, they are pretty tarnished.

I love that you can do this and that's probably what I would do, too.
But I also love that Coinbase and Bitpay are around to bring BTC to the masses who don't wish to meddle with such things.

I bought all new furniture for my apartment with Bitcoin from Crate and Barrel via Gyft.com.

I also just moved and spent more than $7,000 worth of BTC to furnish my apartment. A lot of it via Gyft.
There is real money at play here. A lot of people want to spend their Bitcoin!

The first time I paid for something using the Coinbase app and a site that used BitPay, I was just blown away with how slick it was.
I couldn't believe I scanned a QR code and sent money across the skies. And I just held my phone up to the screen, pressed send, and the screen updated instantly saying my payment had been received.
Bitcoin is going to change the world.

I panicked when I read about the Target credit card security breach because I shopped at Target during that time (and I rarely do).

I would be extremely leery of a business selling high-demand products at huge discounts that only accept cash.
Bitcoin is a form of cash and this retailer won't accept anything else? And they're selling things at below-Amazon prices?
This is shady as fuck.
Please be careful people. Use your head. If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.

I've spent a ton through Gyft and I do love them. But, to be fair, unless you are actually gifting the cards to other people, it's kind of a hack. A stepping stone to bigger and better things with Bitcoin. It would be far more convenient to pay directly to the merchant via Bitcoin.
And there are occasional headaches. Like the time I ordered $1,000 worth of custom framed art from Art.com, only to find out they only allow 1 gift card per order. And Gyft only sells $300 gift cards for them. Which meant laboriously breaking my order up and paying a little under or a little over for each order.
I can't wait until all these merchants can accept Bitcoin directly! Maybe Gyft needs to inform them of how many people are buying gift cards for their stores via Bitcoin.

How exactly does it do that? Generate some temporary visa number and pay with that?
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:59:47
Agreed. There is zero downside to the word "bitcoin" appearing more and more splashed across those TVs above the treadmills at the gym. We need everyone and everything talking about Bitcoin and Ron Paul on primetime Fox News is good news.
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:59:39
I'm not disagreeing that Bitcoin might need a lot of work, upgrades, or even an overhaul to sustain those rates. 
But one could likely say the same thing about any network or service when it's first born, and one could certainly say the same thing about Visa when it was incepted.
Imagine some IT guys in the 60's sitting around a table saying the same thing: "If this even takes over a *fraction* of the world's daily purchases, there's no way it's going to be capable enough. It will take a huge overhaul of systems and massive upgrades."
