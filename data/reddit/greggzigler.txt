When I read  I found a relevant section in the standard:
"The Unicode Standard does not duplicate encodings where more than one currency is expressed with the same symbol. Many currency symbols are overstruck letters. There are therefore many minor variants, such as the U+0024 dollar sign $, with one or two vertical bars, or other graphical variation, as shown in Figure 22-1."
The standard seems to consider variations between common representations of the Thai Baht and your proposed BTC symbol to be typographical and not meriting a new Unicode character.

Thanks for replying.  Two comments.  First, I think the context of the symbol will make it clear whether it represents baht or BTC; the use of two English words for one symbol is no more problematic than the use of 'dollar' and 'peso' for another symbol.   Second, the Unicode Consortium will need to approve any new symbol, outweighing any webdev concerns in my mind.

Sort of like how GitHub shows number of consecutive days of code commits. It's a badge of honor for many developers.

I, too, was very pleased with the overall tone of the article. In particular, his closing remark saying that a cryptocurrency could replace the Euro and that we are not too distant from that possible future!  
At one point, he incorrectly asserted that all cryptocurrencies suffer from built-in deflation, and this this is a "problem" that must be solved. Otherwise, I didn't notice any factual problems with the article.
Interesting that he calls Bitcoin a good payment methods but a bad currency. This is almost the opposite of Peter Thiel's assessment that Bitcoin created a currency "but the payment system is lacking."

Why not?  Because of loss of privacy?

Hah, brilliant, I just accidentally tipped the tipper.

Interesting choice of words: "cooking" the books is a bad thing in the article, but "baking" verified transactions in is a good thing. Looks like there's a risk of using lots of food metaphors when writing an article on an empty stomach. :-)
