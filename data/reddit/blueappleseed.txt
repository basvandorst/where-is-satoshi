That's complete bullshit. 
Bitcoin has no minimum age and anyone can use it. A lot of exchanges don't allow minors, but it's completely legal to trade bitcoin as a minor. Minors can easily buy Bitcoin from BTC ATMs, LocalBitcoins, Changelly and several other sites. It's harder to get on exchanges as a minor, but it's not in anyway illegal.

You could try convincing a trusted adult to help you create a Coinbase account and purchase bitcoin. You could have them purchase bitcoin on Coinbase and then send it to you. Your situation sounds kind of tough. It's hard to buy bitcoin as a kid if you parent's don't like it. 
If none of that works, you could try to earn bitcoin on the internet. Or possibly check out different faucets.

Here is a link to the website, you should include a clickable in your main post. 
I think that you have a great concept, but one thing I dislike about your site is the "survey section". I was kinda of annoyed by the first two questions. The first question asked how long you had been involved in cryptocurrency, but there was no answer choice for more than 3 years, but after 2000. The second question also annoyed me in that, you left off everyone who was under 18 and older than 40. My age group wasn't included, and I felt that it should have been. 
I think that you guys have a great idea, but should work on the site some more and also put a contact email at the bottom. I would also take away Particl and ETC, and then add ETH, IOTA, and Dogecoin. Ripple would also be nice. Instead of ""Crypto Gather While You Lather" as a slogan, I think that you should use "Gather Crypto While You Lather".

I do agree with you that the OP probably told/made his kids do this for the internet.
For perspective, I do believe that my parents are good investors and installed good values on me. My mom prefers a more traditional approach, while my dad was an early Bitcoin adopter and started mining it when it first existed. He really likes the technology behind it. My step dad, on the other hand, holds a lot of BTC/LTC/ETH, but only in Coinbase and he is only in it for the potential profit. He doesn't really understand the technology.
I also feel that while a lot of my peers known what bitcoin is, not many of my classmates actually understand it or have any. I took a different approach to money as a young kid, and my peers often had a different mentality. Most of my classmates on focused on shoes, fashion, candy, social media and people of the opposite gender. Most don't care about the economy or banks or bitcoin or investing.
But, some do, and I'm one of them.

Bitcoin currently has a market cap of ~$150 billion and according to figures from the St. Louis Federal Reserve from July 2017, the monetary base and USD market cap was nearly $3.8 trillion, including coins and deposits. The monetary base has increased more than fourfold from the Great Recession, and it's currently about 25 times larger than that of bitcoin, even after bitcoin's enormous run.
No one knows the exact number of Bitcoin users, but Coinbase has 13,300,000 users and Blockchain.info has more than 19,000,000 users. I would guess that there are about 150 million bitcoin users. I honestly don't know and its hard to calculate because:
1. One person can have thousands of different bitcoin address so we can't use this to find the number of users.
2. One person can have bitcoin wallets in multiple web wallets so their number of users can't give real calculation.
3. Everyday new people are starting to use bitcoin which makes calculation even harder. 
4. A lot of people don't use web wallets, and some keep everything on exchanges.

As another fellow teenager and bitcoin investor I have some advice: 
- Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. This doesn't really apply to you, because you could lose all of your money. It would suck and be really bad, bit it wouldn't screw up your life.
- If you are buying more than $1,000 I would definitely get a hardware wallet. Always make sure to backup your keys and keep everything in a safe place. I wouldn't invest all of your money, but you can if you want. You could possibly buy $500 a month for a few months. 
- I would also look into some altcoins for diversification. May people in this sub disagree, but I believe that some other cryptocurrencies have just as much potential as bitcoin. 
- I also don't think that you need a financial advisor. Most don't know anything about bitcoin, and he probably won't be much help.
- Always do your own research and be careful of scams.
- Good luck. If you have any questions, comment here or send me a PM.
