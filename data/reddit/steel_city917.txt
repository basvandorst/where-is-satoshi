Shit, where I come from in New York you can get calves (with a decent deal from someone you sorta/semi know) for about a $160 a pop.

Hell yeah man! Hopefully it treats you well. I put $20 last October/November and I'm up to $600 now for me.

Hey, do you happen to remember the wallet recovery phrase? Or did you have 2FA or anything set up? 
Send them a support ticket no matter what, because I changed phone numbers and lost my wallet recovery phrase, and had to send a support ticket and then they had me submit some form to the Admins which allowed me access into my account.
It may not be 100% workable, but it's worth a shot!

You realize that in the US, there is still a ton of “paper money” that circulates from WAYYYYY longer back than 20 years? Also, our “paper money” is a paper/fabric blend like everyone that doesn’t have a plastic blended currency. 
Paper money, nor a leather wallet will deteriorate within twenty years. 
My father has a leather wallet he uses daily for the last twenty five years, without conditioning or any upkeep, and it’s still in great condition. The majority of wallets could easily withstand twenty years use if people didn’t fuck them up. 
And “paper money” left in a wallet for twenty years would look exactly the same as when you put the money in the wallet. 
Your narrative is a poor one and you are honestly making stuff up just to fit your narrative.
