Gotcha. Thank you. That's what I figured truth be told.
Sometimes as a writer who's dabbled in backend code (mostly Python) I'll mix up what's actually possible, and what's still in the realm of fiction.

So, here's my take as someone who wants to go into economics, politics, and finance. Full disclosure, I'm an undergrad however I do not have a personal stake in BitCoin, I have watched it from the side-lines for years. I do not claim to be a major authority on BitCoin, the following is only my opinion based on years of observation and conjecture.
My main concern right now is that Wall Street isn't treating BTC as though it has potential outside of making them money. They're day-trading on something that was designed to be used as a method of payment. With the approval of BTC futures coming out and now banks getting squeamish it's my assessment they have no fucking clue what they're doing. They see the hockey-stick like everyone else, they see the market cap rising, they see the ASTRONOMICAL rise of BTC day-over-day, adoption in Asia (with S.Korea recently legalizing several exchanges) and they think "oh! We can do that too!" No. Push the breaks.
I've spoken to multiple professors both in the technology field and field of economics and while some are VERY dismissive ("they're the modern tulip", or "isn't that used for underground transactions?") they at the very least recognize **it's not something you should fuck around with if you don't know what you're doing.**
 The fact that the futures will be tied to a normal trading day when BitCoin can be bought and sold 24/7 365 is only the beginning of why short-term futures (which I assume that's what they're going for) are the worst possible idea next to Russia trying to open their own version of BitCoin. Even with **assumed** Wall Street or relatively wealthy entities entering the market whoever it is or isn't, now has caused a move from 16k to 19k back down to 15,000 per coin, all in a single day. It's absolutely unsustainable.
I imagine the financial analysts in JPM and all the other banks are now **correctly** starting to see that this is isn't as easy as they thought. If they were to invest in this market directly to have some actual skin in the game, there's no way to offset a correction as you might in a normal trading market. When it drops it drops. When it rises it rises. They're constrained by a normal working day, everyone else is free to trade as they please.
The only reason it's classed as an asset for tax purposes is because, as you might expect, as of now it is has no legitimacy in the Untied States as a currency, however it is still something with value and something people make money off of-therefore, it is a financial asset. That's where I think the mixed signals are coming from. BitCoin supporters and others who've read into this see it as a currency, whereas Wall Street, the general public, billionaires, people with means, they see purely a financial asset to either get rich, diversify their portfolio, or both.

Regulations. Not bitcoin trading, trading of the futures.
