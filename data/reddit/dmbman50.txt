Just take the morals instilled by the media without ever doing your own reserch or adjusting your perepective to think in the shoes of others who don't have as much money/don't think they should have to pay a certin price for a totally objectable exprience. If you don't like a game/movie/song I don't believe you should have to pay just to listen to it. I thought artists created purely for to create and not for money, and though they need it to survive they can't just slap some shit together, put a high price tag on it , and sell it off as somthing special. Sorry not every video game is worth $60 (especially call of duty, everytime you buy the new one all you are getting is the same game with different looking graphics)

Which would create a great time for people to buy bitcoin which would then make it probs go over 50k ....so I don't see a problem. Long-term investment is a scary though for some people.

Interesting way to put it. They split everyone gets new coins. They all trade those coins for more bitcoins/cash when the price raises ,thus crashing the new fork and giving more value to bitcoin and giving those that participanted a little somthing extra.

He's a hero. Dont care what you say. He saved more lifes by providing a clean source of narcotics for people who would have been taking to the streets for them anyways. Sources like the silk road stop overdoses and laced drugs from killing people.

No it was stealing. Having bitcoins in a account that allows people to buy drugs is not illegal. Possessing and selling drugs are illegal. So whether the intention was to buy a legal or illegal item off the market wasn't question, everyone just got their money taken regardless if you were to to buy LSD or a piece of glass/rolling paper/ grinders/ books you lost your money. Even though only one of those items is illegal.

That's the whole controversy behind the TOR network. It creates a medium for illegal activities yet courts havnt been able to make the use of the TOR browser illegal along with ruling that use of the browser is not probable cause. I'm sure there's more than a few courts that would accept that.

Like a lot of depression drugs on the market only work for certain people why take away the option of someone getting heathly using ketamine? There's a lot less people getting addicted to drugs than everyone thinks
