There already is...
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:01:20
Took 6 hours for me yesterday in pending

same thing here... Everyone complains about the fees on coinbase but in the end the fees aren't bad at all for what you get.

: )
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:41:04

@_date: 2017-12-13 03:50:24
approved

Could you triple it in 3 days ?
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:43:55
Sell on the low buy on the high?

Coinbase is slow to send right now.  Took mine 6 hours to move from pending.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:49:36
Why would gdax pay the fee?
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:42:25
Thank you for taking the time to thank him for thanking you.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:25:55
 its happening to a lot of people.  Mine took 6 hours or so.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:39:39
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:43:47
Copy and paste and double check before hitting send ?
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:35:11
Million bucks 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:07:43
idk but I was always told to buy direct from them.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:38:00
I just set a high and low alert on blockfolio.  That way I don't need to think about the price till my phone starts going off.

so exclusive and hip
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:02:10
So if I get another nano s.  I put the seed words in from the first nano s?  And can use both at same time?
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:47:18
this is why I'm never doing a long trans in gdax again.  Coinbase could have locked in the price 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:19:21
If they charged less you would never get the transaction confirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:30:03
sounds fun 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:14:11
My buddy has been trying for over a week
