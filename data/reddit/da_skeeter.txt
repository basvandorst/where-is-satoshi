I understand I don't want my uhmm clouded judgement to affect my reasoning. I've read through about half of it and I will take a few re-reads and give you some constructive criticism hopefully.

exactly what I saw: one guy happy because he was/is smart enough to realize what is going on, and four dip shits that CNBC told to shut the hell up because they have no experience on what to say.

I do not think anyone that endorses Bitcoin is a true "liberal", but rather we are all moderates that have grown tired of the traditional banking, and governmental system. 
I.E. Listening to shills that take millions on millions from oil and and banking industries...
Yet we still have a moral compass that denounces things such as the death penalty, taxes, and under regulation of our food and energy agencies...

Back in my younger day when the sight was still highly active I had thought it was the most awesome thing since sliced bread. However in the meantime I've though about all the people with problems that have OD'd and how we should have been able to save them as well. And that's when I realized the problem with legalize or decriminalizing all drugs...
