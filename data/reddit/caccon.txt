Lol "news" like this is feeding the already mind blowing level of delusion that exists around this. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:13:21
The delusion I am talking about is the delusion of putting in irresponsible amount of money and hope into this that one day you will buy a lambo and expensive house without having worked for it. Wouldn't it be nice if everybody can be rich. 
Okay let's just say that bitcoin is worth a million dollars one day. You think that million dollars is still going to buy you the same things that a million dollar today? It would mean that so many people have lost faith in the dollar and the government behind it. I'm not saying it's not impossible, but if this were to happen, the route it would happen would not look pretty, and you probably won't want be living in America and be spending us dollars here. Is this what you are hoping for by buying bitcoin and hoping it goes to a million dollars?

Not completely sure what you mean by not having any purchasing power. Also not sure how you took my statement and extended it to all form of investment.

Opposite works the same way lol people who believe bitcoin is the future and pouring money in is making it relevant. It's how this speculative market works brah

I'm not saying money cannot be effortlessly got from money. But the big part of the delusion is the ridiculous expectations that bitcoin will rise exponentially as it has in the past.  They are expecting triple even quadruple digit returns in short period of time, the idea if which is fueled by this "news"

I cant believe I tried to understand this nonsense

You aren't taking into account how many bitcoins and the portion of the person's net worth

Cmon guys some people need this to be able to sleep at night leave them alone

I think it's because they are uncomfortable with the idea of "easy money". Many people work second or third jobs, working over time just to make ends meet. If people are making easy profit with just few clicks of a button what is it saying about the work they do? it's making them fools for working hard for their money. When people get punished for wanting money without working hard for it, it's satisfying.

You better believe it. Many people who wouldn't have gotten into stocks otherwise got into crypto, myself included and many of the people i know lol the reason people been calling it a bubble is because peoples gardeners were doing no loss sales pitch about crypto to grannies

You will be hard pressed to find logic about many things in life, and that's wisdom my friend

And you might say "what about stocks? Other forms of investments? That's easy money" but none of these are as hyped up by media and not as prevalent in the average Joe friends group as bitcoin is. You get more emotional about things that you see in your personal life
