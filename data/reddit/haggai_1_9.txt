All of the militant atheists that I reached out to in hopes of a compromise and only received condescension and mockery in return.


I am sorry you can't accept that worldviews are chosen by the individual based on what they perceive to be most important. You obviously value empirical and logical data, whereas I believe that there are qualia that cannot be grasped logically and due to their subjective nature inherently confound empiricism. And I assert that we as humans are not simply a set of deterministic chemical reactions with all of our decisions fated for us by a set of unexaminable initial states.
I have found my worldview far more effective at predicting and understanding the interactions of thinking beings than any form of math, physics, chemistry, biology and modern psychology has currently demonstrated.
Therefore, for my qualifications, a non-empirical, non-deterministic worldview based on emergent wisdom gleaned from the only book that has maintained any form of relevance for the last 2000 years is a far more effective and productive worldview than the one currently en vogue with modern empiricists. 


How was it a dick move? No miner I know gives a crap about what the block headers contain. Eligius has no transfer fees and is therefore more profitable than almost any other pool I have mined in.
The dick move is instead on the part of rabbitcoin sensationalizing a pretty innocuous thing.
If you used a library for years for research, and then one day found out that a page from the Bible was set as part of the foundation, would you feel compelled to no longer use it's facilities?

Even though the next question you asked was at the end of your last post, I am responding to it first because I doubt you will read all of my response, and I want to make this very clear first:


I was an atheist and a secular humanist from the age of 14 to the age of 30.
Now I return you to your regularly scheduled response


Sacredness is a concept, there is no such thing as a universally and perpetually accepted concept, you are setting up a strawman, and you know this, yet you persist in relying upon fallacies to make your argument seem stronger. Keep this up and I will end this dialogue.


From what I have experienced, it is because of the prevalence of atheistic indoctrination in our colleges and other centers of advanced education. The same could be said of Objectivism during the early and middle parts of last century. There is a high correlation between capacity for intellectual excellence and the attendance of college. Ayn Rand, as wrong as she turned out to be, was quite popular amongst the intelligentsia of the time, and many professors and students actively espoused her poisonous doctrines. Unsurprisingly, a high correlation between people who attend college and people who identified as Objectivists occurred. Considering how similar the doctrines of Objectivism and Empiricism are, it is expected that the same brainwashing process would occur in our modern centers of education.
I would be interested in knowing what the comparison of non-college educated individuals of genius level IQ that identify themselves as atheist versus those that have attended college and identify themselves as atheist. My hypothesis would be that you would see ratios reflecting the more mainstream percentage of atheists per capita.
As an interesting note, are you aware that there is a strong correlation between people who attend college and homosexuality/bisexuality? Also there is a high correlation between people who attend college and people who commit suicide.


I love this, you insult me and when I call you on it you claim that I am responding out of mental aberration. This is very similar to the techniques used by most anti-establishment groups to justify their venomous rhetoric. Again you have taken the low road in this conversation. I will give you one more chance, and after that I am done with this pointless attempt at discussion.


Yes you are, you and everyone else who has the absence of a belief in a divine being are atheists. You are a group, just like the group of all people with red hair, the group of all people who enjoy pasta, and the group of all people who have successfully climbed K2. 


Pure speculation, the same post-purchase justification and suboptimal purchase selection have been noted amongst all demographics. And to refute your claim, there is an interesting trend noted by several tech advertising firms that show high-intelligence customers to actually be less capable of making optimal purchasing decisions and even more likely to justify their decisions. I cite for you the current war between Nvidia and ATI (AMD now I guess) video card owners. People who purchase and install their own PC hardware have a high correlation to intelligence, and therefore by your own assertion, have a higher correlation to atheism. 


Me explaining this to you would be as meaningless as explaining color to a blind man. The point I am trying to make with this statement is not that we both are right, but that the qualifications for something existing are flawed. I am not trying in this explanation to say that there is a parallel between the subject of my allusion, but I am using this framework to demonstrate the inadequacy of your qualifications for existence as based on an exclusively empirical worldview.
Democracy exists, it is plain in the fact that it has been documented, nations claim it as their method of government, books have been written about it and people have died for it. Yet you cannot point at a single physical thing and say "This is Democracy". You cannot weigh Democracy, you cannot effectively put it under a physical microscope.
If you then say, that by your empirical standards, Democracy exists, then I contend that God has had orders of magnitude more influence on the events of the world and the lives of it's people than Democracy ever has. 
Again, I am not saying that God only exists as a concept, as Democracy does, I fully assert that He exists as real as the ground beneath your feet, as the air in your lungs, I simply am using this illustration to demonstrate, as I have said above, the inherent weaknesses of purely empirical or logical evaluation of the existence of a thing.


Again more Dawkinisms and generalizations. Please, for the love of all that is good and just have some kind of independent thought.
There have been right bastards on both sides of the fence, and in pretty equal proportions. We are people, which means we are imperfect. For example, one of my imperfections is that I am so amazingly annoyed by the misconceptions that atheists have that I feel the need to try and explain in a rational way that Christians are not inherently lacking in the capacity for logic and critical thought. It has never worked, not once, not in the several hundred conversations that I have had on reddit and IRL.


You have got to be kidding me. Seriously? Do you even know what oppression is? Here is what I see of atheistic oppression from reddit and the web: "Those stupid theists put up a nativity scene in a public park. A PUBLIC PARK! How DARE they force me to be aware of their magical sky wizard's magical virgin baby's birthday"
over **100,000** clergy members were brutally executed during the Great Purge in Russia. The only crime they were guilty of was believing in a God when the atheistic government had outlawed religion.
Don't you **DARE** talk to me about oppression.


I understand that religion has been the single most unifying force in every single human society since the beginning of recorded history.
I understand that there are people who are resentful for the negative impact on their personal freedom that they perceive religion and religious people instigate.
I understand that the more intelligent a person is, the more complex and apparently truthful their justification for struggling against established social institutions.
My goal is the maximum happiness for the maximum amount of people. Science has a part in this to provide medicines, advances in technology, and explanations for natural laws. This is only one facet of the overall picture. Atheistic societies have historically been linked with corruption, immorality and self destruction. You think that atheism is something new? You think you have discovered a precious secret that will overturn the world? Maybe you should research a bit more into pre-19th century atheistic societies, and have a glimpse into the world you strive to create.
I'm done here, you are no different from the hundreds of other self-entitled, close-minded Dawkins spouting, pseudo-intellectual atheists I have encountered in my last six years as a Christian. Do they crank you people out at a factory somewhere? I swear not a single one of you has said anything even remotely original.

Frankly I wouldn't care. It has no impact on my mining nor on the results thereof, like the buried page it exists but imparts or removes nothing from the function of the whole. 
And if apetersson is to be believed, the new block headers also contain slander against Luke-jr now also.


Confirmation bias and the Illusion of asymmetric insight actual both state that it is highly unlikely for anyone to change their position, no matter what evidence is presented to them, and this applies to both atheists and theists equally. Nevertheless you were compelled to become an atheist, and I was compelled to change from secular humanism to Christianity. Funny old world, yes?


And as I point out, whatever he puts in the headers is meaningless unless someone looks for it and chooses to be offended.
I have my most treasured concepts insulted hourly by the atheist community on reddit, in almost every forum that I visit. Not even has been exempt from their antagonistic hatred. And yet, I have no right or power to prevent this. The part of me that seeks a balanced world by my own value system would say "that is just as fair as this" and move on.
In truth, you and your kind find absolutely no meaning or sense in the values I hold dear, and that which you value (logic and objectivism) still has meaning to me, but it is superseded by the personal experiences and truths I have found as a follower of Jesus.
I have not cast away logic, I am an IT professional and use logic as a tool in my daily work.
I have not cast away empirical examination, I am also a teacher and I use this tool often to bring complex concepts to my students.
But these are tools, not ultimate truths. Not even ultimate tools, because they do not reveal anything about internal personal experience.
In fact, according to deterministic empiricism, there is no personality in which to experience, this is a concept that I find as ridiculous as you do the "magical sky wizard" that I worship.

Here is the most important question you have asked me this entire conversation. I hope to answer it thoroughly, so please don't think that I am ignoring your other statements, if after reading this you are still interested in me responding to them I will, but if I included both the below answer and as detailed a response as you deserve for each of your other questions or statements, I fear it will be too much to read easily.


A series of extremely statistically unlikely events over a period of two years that took me from the co-owner of a moderately successful consulting company to being homeless and living out of my car and addicted to drugs. (No, the drugs were not part of the loss of my company and finances, they came after as a stupid method of self-consolation). At the lowest point of this experience, when my misery was too great to bear I attempted suicide (that is one thing atheism had going for it, the promise of non-existence, which I greatly desired at the time). There I was, self-medicated to the point of numbness, sitting in my broken down car at 3am, two hesitation slashes already on my wrist and bleeding pretty freely. And I see a cross light up a few blocks away above the top of some trees. Something in me stills for a second, I stare at the cross and wonder how unlikely it would be lit up just now considering that there was very little chance that someone would be in the church at 3am to turn it on, and I thought: "Why not, maybe they can help me, and if not, I still have my razor". Keep in mind that I did not seek them for spiritual guidance, I was still an atheist, I was more looking for a meal and a real bed. 
After another five months of seriously unlikely coincidence, I ended up in a Christian drug and alcohol rehabilitation program, again initially not looking for a spiritual experience, just for (as they call it in the homeless community) "Three hots and a cot" (three meals a day and a place to sleep).
Over time I began to wonder about the peace and compassion expressed by the staff and more senior students at the program. Since it was a fully self-funded ministry via repairing and reselling donated furniture, electronics, clothing and other items, there was plenty of work to do. 
Time and again when circumstances arose that had, in the lives of my atheistic and non-theistic friends in the past, would have caused varying degrees of stress, anger or despair, I witnessed these people maintaining a positive outlook, provide useful and workable advice regarding real-world circumstances dealt with in Biblical ways. They really did live more fulfilling and productive lives than anyone I had known in the past, including several of my "successful" business-owning peers and rivals in the technology and retail sectors. 
And the common denominator between all of these people was a theistic belief, and a trust in the loving benevolence of a divine being.
Being a man of logic, I was determined to construct a method to test the existence or effectiveness of these beliefs. 
One of the few things that God in the Bible directly said to test Him on was the effects of tithing [Malachi 3:10](


I thought, this is a perfect opportunity. Every week, all the students in the program received a small monetary stipend to buy toiletries, cigarettes and the occasional snack or soda. It was really a tiny amount compared to what I was used to having as a consultant. We received it on Fridays, and without fail I was always broke by Monday. Here was my thinking:
"I will not change my spending habits, I will choose to give a tithe (10%) of what I receive.  Logically, because of my increased spending, I should run out of money even sooner, or at the very least, around the same time. If I am right, I have proven that God is just in their minds, and is a placebo effect.
The very week I began tithing, again a series of highly unlikely events began occurring that drastically improved my material situation. The department I was assigned to work in began giving out financial incentives for good performance, which I won consistently. Without any request on my part or logical reason, people I didn't know very well began being amazingly generous to me with no desire for compensation. The few times that I did run out of money before I was able to purchase all of my necessities (razor, shampoo, etc...) we invariably would receive a massive donation of the exact item that I needed, and the staff members decided to distribute them amongst the students.
I lacked for nothing that I needed, and I had access to many more of the "small luxuries" available. (I hope you have experienced the simple joy of a cool bottle of iced tea after a long day mowing the grass)
And yet, I should have had less, because I was giving away a dime for every dollar I had, it made no logical sense!
Yet I could not deny it's affects as I looked over the spreadsheet I had created to track my income and expenditures. I had also tracked the occurrence of gifts or donations that supplemented my standard spending pattern. And the only conclusion that I could come to was that an unexplainable and counter-intuitive thing had happened: Giving away money saved and made me more money!
I made sure no one was aware of my tithing, so that their generosity wasn't based upon them witnessing me tithing, nor did I treat anyone differently at this point, yet my financial situation continued to improve.
Now, unintentionally, I did not tithe some weeks, not as a controlled test mind you, but as circumstances or greed and poor judgment  prevented me, the bounty that I had experienced dried up almost instantly, until I returned to tithing again.
So I had tested God, and over a period of several months, He had consistently provided for me in highly unlikely ways. Would these events still have occurred if I had not tithed? There is no way short of time travel to test this, but each week I tithed, I had all I needed and a lot of what I wanted. Every week I did not, I had to get by without.
So this opened up in my mind the possibility that there is a being that exists that can exert subtle and pervasive alterations of the universe in the way that the Bible claims that the God of Abraham is able to do. I began testing various other aspects of the promises that He has made throughout the Bible with a skeptic's incredulous eye, and each time He has revealed a little more of His aspect to me. With new eyes I began examining the Bible, especially Proverbs and the words of Jesus himself, and I began to piece together a greater understanding of the world around me and the interactions between it and people, and between groups of people. 
With this Biblically based knowledge, I have prospered. I have become IT manager at one of the ministries campuses, I have also been asked to be a teacher for our Anger Management class (An honor that fills my day with greater purpose than any other job I have had, no matter how well paying). Every day I am able to be part of a process that transforms broken and addicted men and women into productive and happy members of society.
Our alumni have come from every strata of society, we have had self-made millionaires, migrant farm workers, professors and tradesmen, atheists and satanists and almost every denomination of Christian under the sun. And they all come for various reasons, now I would be lying to say that each and every one leaves here clean and sober and returns to a productive life, but our success rate is far greater than AA or NA over a 2 year spread, even greater than every publicly and privately funded 90 day program in our state.
You may argue that religion is detrimental to society, but I demonstrate every single day that not only can it be beneficial, that it can be better at some things than a secular version offering the same services can be.

That is incorrect. If what you just stated was true, then there would be no word "sacred" to label things as such. A more accurate statement for you is "I think nothing is sacred" and I would agree that you think nothing is sacred, and I would point out that this is the root of many problems in society today.


No, I think people insult me when they use hateful and abusive language to refer to me, to the social structure that I choose to participate in, and to the institutions an concepts that I deem important.
Plenty of atheists have told me, "there is no god" and fine, they disagree with me, they are not insulting me.
But when they say: "How can you be so stupid as to believe in a magical invisible sky wizard that lets babies die and murders live", then this is an insult. I have gotten far more of the latter statements from the atheistic community.


Yeah, every time an atheist mentions this to me, I like to point out that the single greatest mathematician in history, with a far greater capacity for reason and logic than you will ever have, Isaac Newton, was a believer in a divine creator.


Ah, echoes of Dawkins here. Why does every atheist I speak to insist that my choice of faiths is completely arbitrary? I have heard the argument several dozen times and it is based upon the insistence that only regional social pressures dictate the choice of religion. There is no evidence that, given the widespread adoption of many non-local religions all over the globe. Please have an original thought, thank you.


Such a thinly veiled allusion to Christians, and by extension my, lack of logical thought. Please see my above reference to Newton.


Again such a great example of the shortsightedness of your empirical framework. Black and white, right and wrong, real and imaginary. You fail, as most of your ilk, to realize that there are very few absolutes in the universe outside of man's self-created conceptualizations. Occam's razor isn't always right, and what is important can't always be measured.
Logic and reason, along with experimentation are fine tools for use on certain problems. You cannot console a youth who has experience his first breakup by telling him that what he is experiencing is simply a series of chemical reactions instigated by an archaic fight-or-flight mechanism evolved to deal with a chaotic environment. Also, you cannot calculate the speed at which altruism travels, it is meaningless to even consider it.
There are many questions that logic and reason dictate are unfalsifiable, yet have direct impact on the lives of millions of people. If empirical methods are ineffective at addressing them, then there must be a toolset that addresses these needs, and there is.
You are like an electrical engineer that interprets everything they experience according to the rules that he understands, and therefore he and you miss out on so many nuances and concepts that fall outside the comparison of your relatively narrow viewpoints.


1) You have no concept of what "open source" means then, I take it?
2) No I don't have a problem with it. Please, post the entirety of your atheist manifesto as headers in the block chain. 
3) Did you know that when the file format for the .EXE was being developed, the header characters were chosen to be MZ for Mark Zbikowski, one of the designers at Microsoft that helped develop MS DOS. So almost every executable file ever made is a digital homage to this man. Most people never knew, most people that new didn't care. Please extricate your cranium from your rectum, this isn't a big deal.
What IS a big deal is that every singly forum I attend, EVERY ONE has you atheists whining about how oppressed you are, and how wicked evil religion is. Please get over yourselves, that is all.
