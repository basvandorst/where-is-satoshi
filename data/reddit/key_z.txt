i was replying with how to deal with the situation *before* the phone got stolen/lost. In other words, if you didn't write down backup code and realized that was the case.
If you didn't write down backup code and didn't realize that was the case until after you lost phone.... then I don't know what to say.

disable and then re-enable 2FA. Doing so will allow you to copy down the secret key for 2FA.
Then, if phone gets stolen or dropped into toilet, you can re-establish Google Auth on a new phone by using the secret key.

agreed - this is a super shitty situation.
work around: get on GDAX, pull coin from coinbase wallet, sell coin, and withdraw to bank account.

work around: get on GDAX, pull coin from coinbase wallet (or deposit cash if buying), buy/sell coin on exchange, and either send coin to coinbase wallet or withdraw $ to bank account.
