Most nodes will die, like 90% of them.
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:49:51
They check the validity of the transactions themselves with their own node, they wouldn't trust your node, just like you do when a transaction is relayed to you.
They could absolutely make their mempool smaller. However why would they do this? They'd make a lot less money.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:19:28
If I were you I would just suck it up yeah. Maybe you want to visit the IRC channel to see if there are ways you could make the transfer cheaper.
Honestly at 2 BTC, the transaction fee percentage is very small, and the gains you made (or you will make) on those 2 BTC pay for the fee.
Just make sure you transfer the coins to a segwit address in your ledger.
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:21:29
Segwit opt in is more like, yo you should really use this thing new thing, it'll lower the fees by a lot, but I won't force the upgrade on you and break your website.
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:10:14
Yes, though I wonder how it would work if the recipient doesn't have a channel open. Not sure about the UX of it all.
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:50:55
That is a great question, and actually I guess miners could make legacy blocks as long as no segwit transactions are included.
However, I think they are incentivized to do include segwit transactions because they get to pack more transactions within the same space, so they get more in fees. There are probably more technical reasons as well related to the address format but I am not sure.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:41:57
Yup. And if you think about it, there's no difference between a normal transaction and a one time LN transaction from the sender's perspective. Seems like a clean way to transition.

It was activated by miners, they all support it. They could in theory decide to not mine segwit blocks but they'd have to also not include segwit txs in their blocks, thus missing out on fees.

Doesn't work for you?

Did you check out the LN demos? Looks pretty good!
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:46:26
Not because of Segwit. Have you tried to look at other blockchain explorers? Does your ledger show the transactions?

I use it. Seems stupid not to tbh.
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:26:43
Well they might be able to use LN if they sneak in a segwit-like patch under a different during one of their scheduled hard forks. I am not sure what happens to the old addresses in this case, dunno if it breaks backwards compatibility. I seriously doubt this would fly without splitting the chain either way.
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:45:21
Yes we need more tutorials, people making youtube videos showing mock stores, etc.

@_date: 2018-01-12 07:30:17
The dude is mistaken, you need to set up a channel by making a transaction on chain. Once it's set up, you can do as many transactions within LN with the node you established a channel with.
You're actually making Bitcoin transactions within then channel, but they're only between you and the other person instead of broadcasted to the network. Those off chain transactions are built in a way that prevents the other person from cheating you.
And then when you want out of the channel, you just push the latest off chain transaction to the network.
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:52:34
That fork would never replace the main chain.
@_date: 2018-01-13 07:42:29

@_date: 2018-01-05 09:51:17
It's because you're sending from gdax. Basically the transaction hasn't been pushed to the Bitcoin network yet.
So, you'll see the transaction whenever gdax decides to create it.
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:41:46
I'm sure there's a thread somewhere but, bitstamp is quite good and supports segwit. As far as wallets go, you should get something like a Ledger. Or you can take a stab at running a full node if you're somewhat technical.
@_date: 2018-01-24 08:02:23

@_date: 2018-01-09 07:43:58
In LN, you're actually doing bitcoin transactions within your channel, they are just done only between you and the node you're connected to. The transactions have to be cryptographically valid. It's not like a database where you can just update the btc amount of a column. My node is gonna check that you send me valid transactions with the right keys, signatures or whatever. In LN, you use the blockchain as the ultimate judge to punish bad actors.
The only way I can try to rip you off is by closing the channel without your consent, by pushing an old state of the channel. For example, I'd use the state of the channel that we had before I sent you the money for the coffee.
Good news for you, you just doubled your stack of coins! Noice
When you and I agree to update the state of the channel (which happened when I bought the coffee from you), you get the secret that lets you spend the coins from my previous channel state.
So basically, I push the old state on chain, but because of the way the contract is made, I have to wait a week to spend those coins. However, you have the secret to that old state so you can spend them right way.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:56:27
The reason people call it spam is because they could do simple things to use a tenth of the space they are currently using. But instead they choose to remain unoptimized and pass on the cost to their users and to some extent, the network as a whole.

@_date: 2018-01-09 15:57:06
I guess you're right as long as the block doesn't have any segwit transactions in it.
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:56:07
Ot may look complex, but this stuff is easy if you're a dev. This means that it's going to be easy to create user-friendly UIs for it, you just have to wait a little bit.
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:33:15
No, this would be a private connection between you and your friend.
For the best buy example, it's reasonable to assume that their node would be well connected with a bunch of other nodes. Actually they would probably outsource the node stuff to a payment processor.
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:52:46
What matters is the minimum fee to get confirmed within 2-3 blocks, not how many unconfirmed transactions there are.
In theory, you could just submit a bunch of 1sat/wu transactions and get to 1m unconfirmed transactions, without noticeably affecting the fee other people would have to pay
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:42:48
No, he's talking about a different kind of segwit address. The one in ledger will work pretty much exactly like the legacy address.

@_date: 2018-01-23 05:11:07

If you use segwit you get your blocksize increase. It's really that simple.
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:52:04
Bitcoin is like a 2 lane highway, and coinbase is like a truck that's parked on of the lanes.
Right now, adding more lanes would destroy a bunch of houses. Those home owners are one of the groups of people that decide to add more lanes.
You're asking the people who architected the homes to fix this situation.
Even if the architects wanted to build the new lanes, all they can do is try to convince all the home owners. There's also a bunch of teams architecting different but similar houses. Those would need to change their plans as well.

@_date: 2018-01-30 03:29:47
You can still do a on-chain transaction to show Bob. I guess the dream is that LN reduces the demand for on-chain transactions, so it should in theory reduce the on-chain fees.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:33:58
Well the reason this works is because the cost is pushed down to the end-users of coinbase. If this was a single actor, then it would be insanely expensive for them to raise the fee floor like this. 
And to be honest the network is still working fine, it's just more expensive to transact. But the nodes are not on fire. Imagine if we had bigger blocks, then coinbase would have no incentive to optimize, they could fill up the blocks for cheap and cause most nodes to shut down.
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:42:26
Try setting up a node on testnet first, it's kinda fun and you'll learn a ton.
If you're looking for an easy way to do this, then you'll have to wait a little bit longer I'm afraid.

@_date: 2018-01-10 05:59:40
Yeah the blockchain layer is a broadcast network. When you send a transaction it has to be sent across the planet to most nodes. Ethernet works kinda the same way on a network. We need the tcp/ip equivalent on top of bitcoin, which is LN.
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:44:44
for real lol
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:49:17
As a community, how can we help to solve this issue?
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:37:00
The hard part was getting segwit. Now that it's enabled, we can use LN to transaction with websites and other services without going on chain. So we don't need to depend on exchanges to adopt it. It's also pretty simple to integrate it with your website, so this should help. It also gives us atomic swaps so we can do trading without going on an exchange either.
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:14:41
Legacy blocks are not accepted by nodes running 0.13 or greater, since segwit was activated. Those blocks will be orphaned and the miner won't get the block reward.
EDIT: Alright fine they can get accepted as long as they contain no segwit transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:25:34
I think if you have a modern router, you don't even need to worry about it. I could be wrong though.
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:55:49
Not sure why you're being downvoted... having a bunch of inputs does make your transaction bigger in terms of size. Might be a good time to consolidate into a segwit address if you haven't already, though not sure if that changes anything for legacy inputs.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:42:59
No, he's talking about a different kind of segwit address. The one in ledger will work pretty much exactly like the legacy address.

Segwit is basically the car improvement... sort of I guess. I'm sure if there was an obvious way to fix it for everyone immediated, without compromising the network, it would have been done.
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:01:46
Yeah dude! It has crashed many many times, so don't worry. To be honest the run to 19k was kinda abnormal. This seems much more stable to me.

It would be up to the miners to do this, nothing you and I can really do about it. But why would they?

True however you could say the same thing about an exchange. Just hack coinbase and short Bitcoin. I assume most of those hubs will be run by exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:24:38
I would not worry about too much about it. As far as I can tell, your coins are safe. 
Even though the transaction is in the node that your ledger interacts with, it looks like your transaction was ignored by the network.
Did you set a really low fee? Like, less than 10sat/byte? If so, it's possible most nodes are not relaying the transaction. I'm not sure what's the default min relay fee.
EDIT: Sorry I might've misread your post. You are looking at the address in the block explorers, but what about the transaction ID? Are you seeing it?
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:05:17
I agree with this
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:58:48
Hopefully this is the economic incentive we need to get them to stop the spam and optimize their stuff.
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:31:47
Nah they'll merge it back in, but they'll call the feature something else.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:34:42
Your node dictates the rules you adhere to. If a miner starts obeying different rules, then from your perspective the miner is mining an altcoin. It would be like losing hashpower.
If only miners can run nodes, then they get to do arbitrairy changes to the rules on your behalf. It's actually the same thing if you don't run a full node, except youre letting the wallet decide the rules for you.
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:03:24
Just make small batches
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:23:38
Mining nodes definitely all support segwit otherwise they'd be mining an invalid chain. You must mean something else.
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:28:17
see table here:
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:33:11
You pay less fees for the same transaction so it's way cheaper to get into the next block.
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:52:38
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:56:57
The exchanges are raising the fees quite a bit.
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:46:20
Maybe there's something we could do to help, like a bitcoin integration / optimization dev task force?
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:32:46
Whats your use case?
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:55:27
Transactions have an identifier, basically a transaction number. This identifier / "number" is built from the info contained in the transaction (the real term for this is a hash).
The problem was, nodes can change the info within a transaction such that the "number" (hash) changes, but the transaction itself remains valid. One way they can do this is by changing the signature data in the transaction, like adding some dummy data at the end of it. This is transaction malleability.
The problem with transaction malleability is that you can't use the transaction "number" as a unique transaction identifier. You could have two numbers that represent the same transaction. This makes building something like LN really tricky. 
So, segwit changes the structure of the data within a transaction such that you can create a unique transaction number (hash) for a transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:38:23
The bch hardforks are going to be glorious to watch omg.
@_date: 2018-01-14 06:24:37
The problem is, the mempool is a thing that only exists on a per-node basis. It's subject to the policy of the node itself, not the network.
There is no concept "latest transaction". Imagine a miner in canada versus in china. Let's say there's two transactions made simultaneously, one in Canada (txA) and another in China (txB). The Chinese miner is going to receive txB first, and then txA. The Canadian miner will get txA and then txB. Let's say that the chinese miner gets the block first. How does the miner (node) in Canada verifies that txB was done before txA? According to his node, txA was first.
So you can't really create a validation rule that can be enforced based on a transaction timestamp.
The only "time" that everybody can agree on is based on the block ordering. And even then we can only agree on that after a certain amount of "time" (i.e. blocks) have passed.
That's not to say that what you're suggesting can't be implemented as a node policy. It could be done as a node policy, but you'd have to convince miners to do it. Perhaps it could be done as a second step. Sort by fee rate and then sort by time. But again something like this can't really be part of the block validation rules. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:43:03
Why so negative? This is pretty cool imo
And for the fees, I mean even if you have to pay for two transactions, you will at least be able to do a bunch of other transactions for nearly no cost within LN. And assuming this drives segwit adoption, the on-chain fees overall should decrease.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:54:09
Btw you only get the benefits of segwit when you do:
Segwit to segwit OR segwit to legacy
You get no benefit for gdax to segwit, since gdax has legacy addresses.
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:25:02
Yeah but if they try to do this, I'm pretty sure you can just set the unconfirmed commitment transaction of the thief as the input to your revocation transaction, put a high fee and get it confirmed.
That fee would be paid for by the person trying to rip you off. You can set the fee to be as high as the value of your channel without losing money.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:32:05
I think what you're doing is a really good step, identifying and calling out blockchain anti-patterns like this one.
Another step could be to demonstrate how to actually do some of the optimizations in code. If I try to google something like "transaction batching bitcoin tutorial", there are 0 tutorials or how-to's.
I think that a lot of companies won't care, because they're busy with other things, but if the information is more accessible, then may be easier for people to build a competing product.

The ATH was also not really sustainable. The price just shot up from 11k in a day or two. This seems much more stable to me.

You know, you're actually incentivized to monitor for fraud attempts, because if your counterparty tries to rip you off, you get to take all the coins from the channel.
The commitment transaction is set up in a way that gives you a lot of time for you to contest it in the event that the other person tries to rip you off. So, you definitely don't need to be always online and monitor.
For a phone wallet, I assume the monitoring will be done automatically.
On a node, if you only want to run it for yourself, then it's fine if you don't run it 24/7. But if you want people to create channels with you, then should be online 24/7 anyway. Otherwise, people will just close their channels and find a new node with better uptime. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:32:03
Either way I agree with what you said, if it's something that must be done, it's probably the only semi-difficult thing to do.

His argument is that the chain grows too fast, and at 300kb chain growth keeps up with the tech advances.

box I'm using has a 2.8ghz i7 with 16gb ram (mbp 2015). I could try to sync on one of my servers later (some 32core xeon with 256gb ram and 1gbps symmetric connection), should give an upper limit lol. It makes too much noise to power on right now.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:11:28
Yeah I guess you can't get people you establish a channel with you unless you have a public IP, at least right now. That's the only way I got payments to work on eclair without getting a routing error.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:58:54
This!!! The segwit upgrade was backwards compatible, so by using non-segwit addresses, you're not getting any benefits of the upgrade. When you use segwit addresses, your fees will be way lower because you're using the upgrade.
We just need to get more merchants and exchanges to support segwit. Bitflyer supports it, apparently Kraken also does.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:07:13
I'm not sure they do, however the exchange is quite good! 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:26:35
You can really easily create segwit addresses via the CLI tool, I did it the other day to test out LN.

You shouldn't really look at overall unconfirmed transactions because it doesn't mean much. There could be a bunch of extremely low fee transactions that wont be confirmed anytime soon.
Instead, you should remove all the transactions below a certain threshold (say 50 or 100 sats) and look at the trend. If it looks like the trend is going down, then you can probably use that fee if you need your transaction to confirm quickly. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:34:55
You submitted your transaction literally during ATH / peak demand for block space.
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:17:07
Threads like these are cancer.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:27:40
That's not happening anytime soon. Always comes back down after 2-3 days. 
But you can use replace by fee. You do an initial transaction with a low fee. If you need to speed it up, you just resend the transaction with a higher fee. 
Much cheaper than child pays for parent. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:39:36
This is what I thought, thank you!
@_date: 2018-09-05 07:01:18
It is a bit complicated but very cool. It has to do with how you update that channel balance within LN. It is a bitcoin smart contract cryptographic magic trick.
When you update the balance with the other person, you're exchanging keys that will allow you to unlock the full channel balance if the other person pushes an older balance on-chain.
So let's say I fund a channel with 1BTC (i.e. 2BTC total commited, 1BTC from you and 1BTC from the other person / merchant). This is a bitcoin transaction, confirmed on-chain. Let's call this State A.
Then I buy a TV for 0.3BTC in LN. So the balance is now 0.7BTC on my end, and 1.3BTC for the merchant. Well, when we updated the balance, we created a new transaction that, when it's pushed on chain (i.e. close the channel), it will give us the correct balance. This transaction is not pushed on chain yet, it only exists between me and the merchant. Let's call this State B.
Now, I don't want to pay for that TV... So I push State A on-chain. It gets confirmed. Do I celebrate? no I cry instead.
When we updated the balance to State B, we exchanged secrets that can be used to unlock the full channel balance if State A is pushed by the other person.
So, when I push State A on chain, well I am basically telling to the bitcoin blockchain: "hey guise, the merchant can spend from the full channel balance".
The secret exchange is not optional. We both do it and we both have to agree. If the merchant disagrees for whatever reason (ex: they are offline), then I have no choice but to close the channel.
One thing to note: The merchant only has a certain amount of time before he can claim those coins. After a certain amount of blocks, I can claim them. This time period is about a week by default. This is something we both negotiate (the computer does it) when we open the channel.
@_date: 2018-09-26 17:11:37
I guess this sounds like good old security vs usability. Thanks for the insight!
Seems like with this kind of open OS, there's an opportunity for standardization which should make it easier to cut them off from the internet (specifically for pushing firmware updates).
Though I know nothing about miner fleet management software so I assume something exists already.

@_date: 2017-12-26 15:03:25
I'm not against LN. I just think that you'll want to connect to a large hub because you want it to be online pretty much all the time, at least right now. I dont want to open a channel with a random dude running a node for fun on windows at home. Also those big hubs will be able to reach a large amount of the network so that's good as well. I already am running a LN node.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:17:32
Try out an exchange that supports segwit like bitflyer ( They opened up in the USA recently, I think it's the biggest japanese exchange.
If you're not buying a lot of coin you can just verify using your address and I think you get access to 2 or 3k.
@_date: 2018-09-27 01:37:47

I guess we really need to make that mining more decentralized then somehow. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 15:37:23
Miners should be checking sigs. If they mine a block with a bad tx, your node will reject this block and they don't get paid.
@_date: 2018-09-26 04:49:22
When did the first light wallets appear? In other words, did satoshi anticipate people not actually running full nodes? Seems to me like he's talking about mining nodes vs non-mining nodes, which would be both full nodes.
@_date: 2018-09-26 06:43:06
Any node that's vulnerable will work. I just said exchange as an example, because that'd probably be a good target to double spend on.
I was gonna say that you could maybe "encircle" the node and make sure they only see your blocks. Turns out this is called an Eclipse Attack:
Apparently there are some countermeasures described, and "several of these were incorporated
in a recent bitcoin software upgrade." (as of 2015).
Version 0.14 (released in 2017) and beyond are affected by the vulnerability, so I think countermeasures are active in the vulnerable versions.
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:57:11
The underlying block chain is what makes it possible to use without trusting the other person.
With LN, you open up a channel, which is just a fancy Bitcoin contract/on chain tx. That contract is set up in a way that if lying happens, you can simply close the channel (push another tx on chain) and the chain will resolve the balance in the honest party's favor. Right now, if that happens to you, you get the other person's channel balance plus yours.
This mechanism is quite cool btw. The underlying block chain has your back.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:59:23
You can already do it on the testnet chain, it's pretty easy but you do have to mess with the config a bit. Not hard if you're familiar with this stuff. Check out the repo for eclair.

Gemini is a pretty great exchange, you guys should check it out. Doesn't really hurt to be verified on many exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:48:13
To be fair we will likely connect to huge hubs run by exchanges and payment processors. But that's cool as long as the base layer stays decentralized.

@_date: 2017-12-25 21:03:54
I guess that's why it was good that it was implemented as a soft fork? Gives everybody time to upgrade at their own pace.
Hard fork would've probably hurt a lot of services since its basically upgrade or die. However my mental model may be flawed so I'd love to get some insights here.

Assuming you find a vulnerable exchange, this only works if a substantial percentage of hashpower is unpatched. The patched miners are going to re-org you.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:36:42
I used bitcoin core to create a segwit address, and I used it for my LN node. So not sure what you're talking about... 
@_date: 2018-09-26 15:24:35
Just curious, why do the hashers need to be connected to the internet ? I would've thought the job distribution would be handled via some central job dispatch server on your end that's connected to the pool, instead of the hashers themselves.
@_date: 2018-09-26 15:17:03
I think I get, but technically I can just switch my coins via an exchange. Is this better because it's done via the network instead?
@_date: 2018-09-05 00:05:25
I don't know about the network but it certainly supports devs which is probably even more important at this stage.

Have you ever transferred any IOTA outside an exchange? It's not really usable at all in its current state. I do like the fact that it's not a copy-paste from BTC or ETH, and the SDK works (ish).
@_date: 2018-09-25 07:37:15
It can be used to trigger a hardfork. As a community, do we embrace the bug or do we re-org? Both outcomes would've sucked.
It's safe now though.
@_date: 2018-09-23 10:36:26
I agree but it would be and true test of strength, especially since most exchanges would get rekt by the reorg...

@_date: 2017-12-26 05:49:08
Depends on how you see it. For example let's say all Chinese miners are forced to break consensus. The full nodes will not accept those invalid blocks even if the miners were able to create the longest chain, right? So the end result would be losing hashpower on the main btc chain and a fork with all the hostile minrrs, as opposed to a rule change on btc chain. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:50:55
You should try to open up an account on Gemini and Bitstamp, that's what I did when coinbase kicked me out. You probably want to wait a few days before transferring your BTC though, since the fees are high at the moment. You should buy some kind of hardware wallet like a Ledger or Trezor.
The learning curve is quite steep at first with bitcoin, but you'll start to understand everything soon enough.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:42:12
Wait how can you just "fork back"? What if the miners don't want to fork back? How do you do this without splitting the chain further? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:00:04
You should help them out!

Bitcoin mining is not profitable to do at home anymore (it has not been for a long time). This is a good thing, because it makes the chain much more secure. More mining farms are coming online soon in Japan and Russia, which will help spread the hashpower away from China.
You don't need a lot of money to "invest" in bitcoin. It is divisible. So you can buy, 0.0001btc for example. When you buy bitcoin from an exchange, you will have to pay fees anytime you cash out or you transfer it. Those fees are relatively expensive if you plan to only buy a small amount like $20's worth.

As long as you don't have more than 50% of miners colluding, everything is good. They also invested a lot of money to build their mining farms, so they have an incentive to keep the network healthy to keep making money. Bitcoin is designed to become harder and harder to mine over time. It adjusts the mining difficulty such that blocks are found roughly every 10 minutes.
If a hostile government or mining corporation tries to take over, we have a defense mechanism: nodes. Everybody can run a node to make sure the miners are following the rules. There are MANY nodes running out there, all over the planet. Miners are incentivized to follow the rules, because if the nodes don't accept what they mine, then they don't get rewarded, which means they can't pay for their electricity. This is part of the decentralization aspect of bitcoin.
And then we have the nuclear option. We can make all the mining farms obsolete by changing the mining algorithm (i.e. the Proof of Work algorithm).
The hashpower is ultimately what gives bitcoin its security and value. Nobody can tamper with the ledger because it takes too much computing power to do so. If you had that much computing power, you would use it to mine bitcoin.
You do not need to mine bitcoin to use as an investment or as a day-to-day currency. You can just straight up buy it. You don't need to buy one whole bitcoin.
The web-based miners are for mining other types of currencies like Monero. You cannot mine bitcoin in this way.

The problem is, the bigger the blocks, the harder it is to run a node. Fewer nodes mean more centralization. Less nodes is very bad.
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:44:59
Things aren't that great in IOTA land. For example, the android wallet just crashes when you enter your seed. A bunch of coins are locked up right now due to a previous issue with the network, and to get the coins back, you have to go through this manual recovery process (I'm still waiting for my coins). The SDK is very unstable, and you have to reverse engineer the wallet to get the right code for the PoW. Oh and also, my node frequently get OOM crashes.
IOTA is really really new. BTC has been around for almost 10 years, and it works fantastically. Some really, unbelievably smart people are working on the code. The best of the best. These spam "attacks" are not cheap at all, that's why they don't last. And they're only getting more expensive.
BTW the miners are getting the fee rewards. There is no incentive for the devs to make users pay high fees.

Eh at least they are talking about it and understand that each currency have different properties.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:51:27
So there are two types of fees. The first fee you will encounter is the exchange fee. Exchanges like coinbase.com will charge you for buying bitcoin. Such is life.
The other fee is the transaction fee. When you transfer bitcoin from one person to another, you need to pay a fee. This fee goes to the miners, and it's a defense mechanism against spam.
When miners mine a block, what they're doing is, they are grouping a bunch of transactions together and "sealing" them. They do this every 10 minutes, more or less. The amount of transactions per block is limited. So, the more transactions that being transmitted to the bitcoin network, the more competition there is to get your transaction into a block. Your transactions need to get into a block otherwise they are not recorded in the blockchain. If your transaction is not in a block (i.e. if it hasn't been confirmed), you can "reverse" it (though it's not really something easy to do for beginners). Once it's included in a block, it's almost impossible to change. After a few blocks, you would need some kind of fusion reactor or perhaps a dyson sphere to reverse your transaction.
The transaction fees are configurable. So, if you need your transaction to get confirmed quickly, then you must set a higher-than-average transaction fee. If you don't need it to be included in a block right away, like if you're sending money to a friend that trusts you won't revert the transaction, then you can set a lower fee.
If you just want to hodl and not spend bitcoin, then this doesn't matter much because you won't be making transactions. This is what I call "investing" I guess.
If you are going to be making transactions, then your wallet software can help you set the right fees (though they tend to usually over-estimate). Unfortunately, when you're using wallets on an exchange like coinbase, the fees are not customizable and they are way too high. So expect your first few transactions to realistically cost you $10 to $20 in fees. 
I honestly just keep my coins in a hardware wallet and chill. If I were to buy something with bitcoin, I would immediately replenish my stash by buying more, so I wouldn't lose any gains.
Even though bitcoin has been around for almost 10 years, there is still much to be done. There was a big release on August 1st that will eventually allow us make transactions cheaper and faster, while still retaining the same properties of bitcoin. This is called the Lightning Network and it's being tested right now. And yes Bitcoin was just the first cryptocurrency. There are TONS of them out there now. Also there are a lot of scams, and lots of misinformation, so be careful. Be especially cautious of the ones that claim to be bitcoin. The ones on coinbase are legit. There's Ethereum which is like a big, planetary-scale virtual computer. Then there's Litecoin which is what I would use to make transactions. It is very similar to bitcoin. There's Monero for anonymous transactions. And more!

The block reward is actually a transaction included in the block they mine. It's a special transaction; it only lets them spend the reward when there's 100 blocks mined on top the their block.
He also gets the fees from any other transaction he includes in the block. I'm not sure what that looks like in the block.

You could have both the old and new PoW on the same chain. It doesn't need to be an immediate switch, it could be gradual. There are many different ways to do this without compromising security.

Have you ever hosted a website before on a cloud server before (ex: a plain HTML page)? Do you know the basics of command line? Hosting a LN node is not that different.
So I suggest starting to learn by hosting a simple website on the cloud. It's not that hard and you'll figure out the gaps in your understanding. Here's what you can try if you feel like it:
0. Create your cloud machine
1. Give it an elastic IP
2. SSH into your new server
3. Open up the firewall to allow traffic to port 9000
4. Create a user account called 'website'.
5. Switch to that user account, go to home dir and create a simple HTML file: `echo "hello world" &gt; index.html`
6. Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` (this spins up a ghetto web server on port 9000).
Then in your browser, go to: ` elastic ip&gt;:9000` and look at your website. If you can figure this out, then you can likely set up a LN routing node.
When it comes to running a successful LN routing node, the most important part is to have very good uptime. Otherwise people won't want to stay connected with you. Hosting it on the cloud with a static IP is good for this.
@_date: 2018-04-21 00:22:19
Did you try it out? The underlying tech is hard to understand, but the end user wallets are quite nice. It's only going to get better over time.
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:15:00
... in theory. I don't think the network is there yet for it to be fully reliable. OP got some errors.

The summer run was fun tho.
@_date: 2018-04-19 05:42:03
Depends... I'm pretty sure connections are established via IP address instead of by some kind of other address derived from your public key.
So, if people are connected to you by IP address instead of by a hostname (assuming connection by hostname is even possible), then you should close your channels before moving your node. Otherwise they won't be able to connect back to you and you're going to get uncooperative channel close.
That said, perhaps this scenario was handled by the devs of your node software. Maybe when you boot up the node on that new box with the new IP, it could tell the peers to update the IP for your node. This probably only works if you can actually connect back to those nodes (i.e. it wouldn't work if the peers are behind a NAT).
This is a very interesting question BTW, I suggest posting this on IRC and reporting back if you get some good answers there.
In any case, you should get a static IP. I would suggest closing your channels unless you get confirmation from the devs of your node software.
@_date: 2018-04-02 03:24:25

@_date: 2018-04-29 21:47:09
There's many ways to double spend a transaction, even when blocks are not full. Otherwise, you wouldn't need mining. One way would be to exploit differences between node policies, which has happened on the BCH network already.

Yeah, there's a type of segwit address that sacrifices a bit of space for compatibility. These addresses will start with the number 3, and it's what you have in your ledger probably. So that's why you were able to send from [blockchain.com]( to the segwit address on your ledger.
But you're only getting the benefits of segwit when you send coins from a segwit address.
