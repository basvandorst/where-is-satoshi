I think it's fairly logical. If the losing side always had to pay fees, large companies with deep pockets could make lawsuits against them so exspensive to lose that few would dare it. 
Imagine suing Apple for $100,000 but you risk paying $1,000,000 in their legal fees plus whatever you've paid for your own representation. I think many wouldn't want to risk that.

I'm sure you can get Apple to refund the money if you've paid for a fake app. That still doesn't make Apple responsible for any loses you've incurred from using that app. 
If OP or OP's friend think he has a case he should of course consult with a lawyer. But they'll tell them the same thing, you're never going to make Apple responsible because legally they aren't.

It really isn't. OP doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell of winning that lawsuit and Apple will never settle since it sets a precedence of paying out for losses they aren't legally responsible for.

I very much doubt Apple has ever promised that the app vetting process is foolproof and it certainly isn't something they're legally required to do.
Furthermore when you sign up for the app store, you agree to not hold Apple responsible for any damages incurred by apps in the store. So unless OP's friend live in a country where such an agreement isn't legal Apple has no responsibility to compensate anything.

If Apple had promised that their vetting process was 100% effective and malware could never enter their store, then maybe.
But even then you'd most likely be stopped by the fact that when signing up for the store you agree to not hold Apple responsible for any damages incurred by anything in the store.
Plus, Apple has almost bottomless pockets, the best lawyers money can buy and an interest in not being responsible for damages. Even if it was absolutely 100% their fault it still could still end up in a multi year lawsuit that would cost way more to win than OP's friend lost.

No, they don't. In general, it is the ones committing a crime who are responsible for that crime. If someone pickpockets you in a store you can't (successfully) sue the store either. 
The only way Apple could ever be held accountable is if they were somehow in on the scam.

That's by no means certain, in fact it usually isn't the case, at least not in the US.

It really isn't, especially not in civil law. There's always two sides to a case and often it comes down a specific interpretation of case law. 
If the winner and loser in a given case was always crystal clear then no plaintiff would ever lose, since who would want to initiate a lawsuit knowing they won't win? But as it stands many people sue and many aren't successful.

Well yes. They have a responsibility to refund what you paid for the app if it wasn't as advertised and I'm sure they'd be happy to do that. 
That doesn't make Apple responsible for damages incurred from using that app because, again, Apple takes no responsibility for how you use it.
