Zimbabwe Dollar was a highly predictable currency, yet look how well that turned out as a store of value.

The US wouldn't; but other countries like China would be interested to play that game.

In the wake of massive bank fraud, collapses and cover-ups... LIBOR... I believe Bitcoin is much better in comparison.
Were it USD instead of Bitcoins when Mt.Gox went down; the story would be the same as the remaining bagholders would regardless be still out of pocket (be it BTC, USD or otherwise).
edit: fwiw; I have no interests in gox aside from being an outside observer.

You know how many emails these tools have reported to them?
An attack of this nature (not to do with Bitcoin, the design of this attack in general) is far more serious than the millionth email from everyone's Nigerian Prince cousin having trouble transferring that million dollars worth of cash out of the country.

Only if he sells when the price is lower.
For example; if I bought one bitcoin at the last peak of ~1300 USD, I'd only realise the loss on that value if I sold that bitcoin today at ~350-400USD.

Mine didn't, I threw it in there myself with disappointment at Google for lacking a more direct means of reporting scams like this email.

Old hat but a Cheque (British for Check) in the mail, marked Non Negotiable worked rather well in my experience.

He is correct in the context of this reddit post (free markets).
No net loss in freedom here either; pock.io has exercised theirs in removal of Apple gift cards and you in turn can still exercise yours with the freedom to obtain such products elsewhere.

In my experience people are too trusting of the program and will allow it to do what it asks (even config.sys is not safe from monkeys and false positives reports, +1 for backups).
Unfortunate also that A/V software isn't as intelligent as people make it out to be, PUPs - potentially unwanted programs - and the odd false positive being some of my own experiences.

The community, if they are so inclined to buy these gift cards, can still exercise the freedom of choice by shopping elsewhere.

The most beautiful piece of irony when it comes to arguing about the value of gold (and silver/copper for that matter) are that the means of debating the matter online involve a significant amount of these metals. :)

The investment is betting that Bitcoins will rise in value against the money spent in their accumulation, how you cash out the investment (same money, goods or even some diversification into 'traditional' investment vehicles) does not strictly require it to be back into the originating resource used to accumulate the product invested.

Maybe their Primary wallet is actually that small change wallet, as opposed to their main BTC holdings in cold storage?

I admit that I am surprised at the possibility that someone could possibly beat BFL to the bottom; with regards to this twitter response (not mine, I don't have a Twitter account).

Even if BTC goes to $0 USD you'd still have it with 0 risk of confiscation (say hi to Cyprus for me).

Drug sniffer dogs also (traces of it on notes, with exception to freshly printed consecutive notes).
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:24:01
limited compared to current usage yes, otoh this would be balanced out by Bitcoin (or again in that event, an alternative crypto) being able to still have a market under the pressure of extermination by the US [read: fed reserve] government.

Yep, see India as an example.

"show me how bitcoin has increased their international sales or if the reduction in fees covers the cost of currency exchange."
I'll show you one example; AmagiMetals saw a huge increase in business when they accepted Bitcoin payments (via BitPay) and without themselves advertising their services (Affiliate marketing came about later which increased sales figures more dramatically) and that is still occurring now during the present shortage of Bullion products being experienced by all sellers of Precious Metals.

I'd lean more towards printer ink, benny and the InkJets (US 'federal' reserve) can't get enough of it.

Giant game of whack-a-coin (mole), would make Bitcoin (less likely but; or whatever alternative crypto that survives this game) even more valuable once it survives everything short of disabling the internet entirely [I acknowledge they would be extremely desperate and have far more important issues to deal with were that to occur].

We do, but it does carry a hefty premium.

Modern alternative is the recent reddit submission of 25 BTC printed on a 1 troy ounce gold coin but IMO the current premium is rather heavier in comparison. =)

Humble beginnings on this grand adventure, but yes do remember this is Bitpay merchants and not all Bitcoin accepting ones (example; were Paypal to make a similar directory it would only list ones that accept Paypal and not all merchants that accept the USD).
Please note that I'm not comparing Bitpay to Paypal, the former is a much better service in my experience.

I don't partake but support it for the economics it provides; the free open and unregulated market that is one of the core inherent values of Bitcoin.

Given what the USD actually is (Global Reserve Currency) and the headaches we are all still suffering from the Nixon Shock (hint: Gold); I'd rather you kept your financial aid and skills in its management within your own borders.

Are based on trading bits of paper that is highly leveraged against the actual (if any) gold amount and secondly said bits of paper are actually not redeemable in the metal (USD only, not sure about the non US based exchanges).
Knock out the paper market and we'll really get to see how much people value the good old fashioned store of wealth when they can't get their hands on it (Silver gave quite a taste of that earlier this year, ask the US Mint about that shortage of American Silver Eagles).
For the record I see a place for both Precious Metals and Bitcoin (and/or alt coins if it comes down to that) in regards to trade, investment and simply a way out from the rubbish that is the USD (and other currencies backed thereof).

Interesting, sounds like the way this thing jumps the air-gap according to the article is similar to Modems [Acoustic Coupler] back in the 80s.

Instead of the above, this malware will substitute a computers speakers and microphone on each machine in place of a phone handset like in the above system.
Spooky; but I can appreciate the ingenuity of this Malware design.

The benefits of a lawful society would be far greater than the comparatively measly pay packets of those tens of thousands of employees. To do otherwise cheapens the rule of law.

Same stick of gum costs 3% more at time of maturity of those savings. If all your after is gum then your better off buying it now.
