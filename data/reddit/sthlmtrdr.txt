Eclair didn't warn you about "duplicate channels" because it is fine to to have multiple channels open to the same hub!
Nothing wrong with having multiple simultaneously channels to the same hub.

I do not think a node has to advertise a exact value. At route setup the requester can ask "can you handle transfer of X value" and the node can answer TRUE/FALSE.

You can sum up all your incoming payments and check that the end balance match, total sales minus expected fee's for that.

I found a block back in 2010 then I was mining on a AMD GPU card. It was in a pool so I didn't get the 50 BTC block reward. But it's cool experience anyhow to find a block :-)

Yes, it's also for regular persons. Just that the amount of funds you can commit decides how much simultaneous traffic you can handle.
A regular person with $1000 can handle some amount of simultaneous payment transactions, someone with $100,000 can handle a lot in more volume.
So everyone can operate LN hubs if they do like.

As a end user you do not have to think about or care about the infrastructure plumbing underneath.
You just pay to the sales cleark at the counter or point-of-sales payment terminal. Or send and receive money from an app in your phone or computer.

Believe a company/business will not have a channel with every employee. It will go through a intermediatiary that is the one that has has the channel open to the employee. Every company of decent size have it's own bank or payment processor that it transact business through.

But a side-chain for smart contracts can run at a very high speed, can't it? it does not need any difficulty.
Bitcoin could facilitate a platform for distributed apps and a decentralized USD pegged stable coin too.

There is a three piece article series on Bitcoin Magazine about LN worth checking out.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:30:54
But that is not how LN will work if I understand the design correctly. 
One does addition and subtraction over the same channel. The same channel may stay open for weeks, months, years.
You as customer will not have a open channel with McDonalds. McD has a channel open towards their LN hub, and you have a channel from your online wallet to your LN Hub. There may be multiple LN hubs in between, like A-B-C-D, where A is McD and D is CoinBase, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:18:06
Will see both usage scenarios. Some businesses will operate their own LB hubs and have channels to their employees and contractors, some will purchase it as a service from an external service provider.
LN is decentralised peer-to-peer, but not distributed peer-to-peer. There is a difference between the two architectures.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:13:05
They can pay their employees though the same channel that they receive payment from the customers, can't they?
If the restaurant received $2M inbound for sold items and they pay outbound $1M for salaries and $0.5 for goods and services, the channel can continue to stay open, could it not?
The company's primary bank that operates the LN hub can convert to fiat at their end, so employees may receive their salaries in USD.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:59:17
Yes. The only thing I can see in advanced mode is that it lets you manually select the route so you bypass certain hubs that you do not want your transfer to pass through.
One may for legal or moral reasons want to bypass certain countries or companies that you do not want anything to do with.
@_date: 2018-09-19 11:33:26
Eventually merchants will do because of completion and they will get more customers and do more business by passing the savings to the customers.
Online store A sells item for $100 with visa/mastercard fee embedded.
Online store B sells same item for $97 using Lightning Network.
What store will get most business? where will the customers go to shop.
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:04:20
Transactions are split up and send over multiple routes simultaneously. So single transactions of &gt;$10,000 will be no problem in the future. They will be sent over routes that can handle the volume.
Today there is a cap programmed into the software on amount allowed to be sent, it's there to protect people from losing money.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:05:29
That may be true. The hub is both receiving and sending so the total balance should be the same.
Alice sends 0.10 to Carol through Bob. So Bob will receive  +0.10 on channel A and send -0.10 on channel B. Total amount is the same for Bob, just that it shifts between the channels.

I'm hoping some kind of NFC support will be included in the BIP that is currently work-in-progress.
Modern point-of-sale terminals got NFC built in and it is just a matter of software update to support LN payments by NFC. Just like they have received updates with support for VISA, MC, Apple Pay over NFC.

One day in the future LN will be operating at 1 billon users, all thanks to Snorr signatures, channel factories and other optimizations.
Lets make LN the worlds first payment system where everyone globaly can participate, also the unbanked masses in africa, south/central america and asia.

I read Starbucks have plans to accept LN payments in the future. That would be really cool and could boost adoption of LN as a global payment rail.
It will happen eventually that LN will become the defacto global standard for payments. But if larger corporations adopt it early global rollout will go faster as it is kind of a quality seal and other corporations will look at that and also start thinking about adopting LN.

Well, good or you then. The thing is if one own assets, one can have the cake and eat it at the same time. You can use the continuous returns from assets to spend every year for the rest of your life vs. spending only one time and have nothing left.

Yes, similiar to "liking" a post one can "gild", ie. make a micropayment tip/donation on the tweet or a tweet comment. The content creator get some money and Twitter get a cut though a fee. So Twitter will have a possible income stream for each tweet and each comment made on the platform. The huge amount of posts and comments volume we are talking real money to be made for Twitter. That is where LN come in, it's the perfect technology for this. This "Gilding" also be applied any other social media platform like Youtube, Imgur, Facebook and so on.

Yes that future is soon here, especially together with decentralized stable coins like DAI, one can do not only crypto trading but also fiat currency trading without touching an exchange. One will be able to trade currency pairs like USD/EUR or USD/YEN without an FX-broker which is a really cool thing.

What is the true BitCoin is what have majority of mining power behind it.
At least 95% of mining capacity will switch to 2M blocks this fall. What is left on the old 1M chain you can rename to BlockstreamCoin. It will be an niche alt-coin just like BCH with no users.
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:25:22
SegWit gives at best 50% more capacity. The 1M hard cap remains so 1.5 MB of capacity. Not that much, maybe enough to last 6-12m into the future.
@_date: 2019-03-09 14:31:06
An expensive car is the worst thing you can spend your money on. Only losers waste their money on shiny things that deprecates in value by twenty percent a year. It just says you are a dumb person, not a smart person.. don't take it personaly.. just saying.. lambos and bullshit like that is nothing to look up to.

Corporate takeover is exactly that Core are trying to do. They are pushing their corporate agenda of Bitsteam against the best of bitcoin users.
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:08:52
Yes, the 2M chain will be the true Bitcoin. The 1M chain they can rename to BitStreamCoin or something. It probably die pretty quickly as all businesses, stores and vendors will support 2M that will have &gt;95% of miners.
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:59:30
There is also a group which prefer SegWit AND block size increase. 
This group is larger than both Core and BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:20:15
They vote by signal on the bits in the blocks. Currently &gt;90% of mining capacity is signaling for BIP 91.
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:46:44
The 1M chain will die out, it is a dead end. All merchants and business users of Bitcoin will leave to the 2M chain.

Something has to be done to solve the congestion and the high transaction fee's it bring.
Bitcoin should have moved to larger blocks serval years ago.
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:46:56
It's different from BCH. In that case there was a small miner minority going their own way, basically only viaBTC.
In this case it is 95% of miners going their direction and keeping the Bitcoin name. Segwit2x = BTC
Bitcoin Core = useless alt-coin with no community support.
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:23:13
No, it is the opposite. After the hard fork the current 1M blocks are invalid.
Miner majority decides the consensus rules. If miner majority is on 2M that means all other blocks are invalid.
Core dev-team have ZERO power to decide or change rules. Only miners can do that.

There is 9 billion people on earth. 15 million users is nothing, basically only one large city on whole of earth.

No, consensus is decided by miner majority. If miners what to change current rules they do so.
You know, all the power is in the hands of miners. They are the only ones that get to decide how things should work. Others can only put forward suggestions.

Lightening wont work well without a block size increase. The current 1MB blocks are full so there is no free space on it to fit the Lightening transactions.

Of course it's a business operating as a middleman, the whole point of BitPay is to charge a fee. How will the corporation turn a profit without a fee?

An LN channel may stay open for years. It doesn't have to be closed.
And with Channel Factories (LN 2.0 or what you may call it) in the future it will be even multiple factor cheaper to close LN channels.

False. If you need something you will buy it regardless, food, clothes, toilet paper, tooth brushes, plane tickets, hotels, food, beer and wine at restaurants, washing machines, home electronics, etc.
If it's something you need or it's broken you will buy a new replacement, regardless of monetary money deflation.
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:40:30
A channel from/to your own personal wallet. If you have your own wallet with 5 channels to different LN endpoints you may keep them open.
One can refill a channel by using submarine swaps or by sending money from one channel to an other channel on the same wallet if one likes. or another wallet that you got.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:39:13
LN is for spending money. It's not a savings account where money stay idle.
You can always transfer money out of your LN wallet to a BTC address or other LN wallet  if you have to much money sitting there. No need to close a channel for that.
LN is for every day spending and consumption. Buying coffee, pizza, gas for your car, paying utility bills, airline tickets, etc.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:03:05
LN channels may stay open for a very long time. No need to close a LN channel if not absolutely necessary.
Google "channel factories", which is a proposed future scaling solution for LN that multiple channels can share the same on-chain transaction. So one can open and close LN channels without an on-chain transaction.

One should keep in mind that LN is still early Alpha/Beta software at the moment. The group of developers that are involved in LN at the protocol level is small. They all know each other, cooperate and have meetings/mailing lists where they discuss the various things around LN, improvements, changes, standards, etc.
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:49:14
So they want to build their own gated community on a empty plot of land, that is fine. The local economy and the native people living there will benefit from that, will create work and income for restaurants, hotels, construction workers, carpenters, plumbers, maids, taxi drivers, etc.

Innovation is big part of the comeback this year. Lightning Network is doing great. If developers and community keep focused on improving up on LN so it can become the worlds default payment system both online and POS, the price will continue go higher due to innovation and new improved functionality in the Bitcoin space.
SegWit was great improvement. Schnorr, Taproot, SPV, MAST, etc. will all provide a positive boost to Bitcoin.

There is no such thing as "white" money or "black" money. Money does not have a color. "black" money is just some nonsense that the government/state has come up with for non-taxed money.
If you ask your neighbor who is a plumber to fix your leaking faucet and pay him $20 for the service. Now this $20 is "black money" according to the state (tax authority). Everyone knows it's just bullshit and any individual have their human right to purchase goods or services from any other private person.

It was bad idea. A pegged sidechain will get into the same scalabiliity issues as Ethereum has?
What you want is a turing complete platform there you can lock money into smart contracts so the smart contract now owns the money and have full control over it.
Why can't LN payments be used for this? ie. send a normal LN payment into the smart contract platform and it can pay you back to the same address used to send the funds. The SC platform can be stand alone and does not have to be linked to the Bitcoin blockchain. If SC platform just can receive and send LN payments, that is all that is needed?
