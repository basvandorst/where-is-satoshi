If IIRC, Google practices strategic open sourcing, in that Google open sources what's entrepreneurially convenient and keeps key things closed source, like their scaling machine learning code and their ranking system. Granted, it's much better than nothing, but I imagine the more purist open-source crowd wouldn't like how Google does open source. I'm not an expert though, so I can't say how Google's form of semi-open sourcing would or wouldn't be a roadblock to the feds.

I imagine daily payments combined with wages based on products/services sold or some other metric controlled by merit would allow for more immediate feedback to employees on their quality as a worker, which could be better for getting employees to do better work.

I'm someone who thinks cryptocurrencies-as-company-stock is the future of crypto-coins, so you seem to be preaching to the choir here.

You mean to tell us that a system that was suppose to be run by everybody is now under control by the minority of people who actually had the time and resources to control it? Where have I heard that before?

You would get paid more?
Yeah, this looks like a topic that is better handled by someone doing this and getting a bajillion dollars if this is a good idea. Everything short of that is just internet debating.

The thing is, open source needs to get it's spare of billionaires to get the innovators on board and the customers to care to make it worth said innovators' time.

I don't see why you couldn't have a base pay that's meant to be adequate in of itself.
