This is true. The problem is that they do so either without any understanding of the anarchist movement or a with a desire to co-opt our language. Their pervasiveness online is actually *changing* what the word means as people, like OP, come into contact with an-cap blogs before ever learning one word of the ~150 years of anti-capitalist struggle of anarchists around the world.

A libertarian socialist is a person who belongs to any of the anarchist tendencies or one of a few kind-of-anarchist-but-not-really groups like the IWW or the council communists. Basically, it's the anti-state wing of the socialist movement, socialists who believe that the way to free the working class from capitalism can't come through the state.

The word "libertarian" was originally interchangeable with "anarchist" but both originally meant the anti-state wing of the socialist movement. Hence terms like "libertarian communism." "Libertarian" was the qualifier on what sort of communist you were, standing in opposition to the Marxist variety. The term "libertarian" was successfully co-opted by the right about half a century ago. They're trying to do the same with "anarchist." Make no mistake, anarchists in the real world are anti-capitalist.

Is that why Chomsky belongs to multiple anti-capitalist organizations?

So, I just want to be clear on this. You're saying capitalism predates history? That it predates money, markets, states, private property, and even agriculture? Does capitalism predate the existence of capital?

Not having a monopoly on violence is the definition of not having a state.
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:11:27
Libertarian socialists aren't so rosy-eyed. We know that capitalists will lash out to protect their privileges with violence if they have to. Large-scale attempts to achieve socialism through libertarian means have usually involved general strikes, occupations, and the formation of workers' militias.
@_date: 2013-05-10 16:32:39
So the entire history of the anarchist movement before Rothbard was what, a lie? They didn't set up monopolies on force but they certainly used it. Notice the [guns](
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:38:30
Ok, getting an idea of what capital *is* is the first step, although that definition isn't the one used by economists. In any case, what sort of relation do people have to capital under capitalism? Who controls it? When labor is done to increase capital, who owns the product? Capitalism is not the same as "trade." It's a way of arranging production which emerged over a particular period of history.

It's worth noting just how farcical the (on paper) guarantee is. Wage theft in the restaurant industry is rampant. I've seen everything: unpaid overtime wages, rounding schemes, being told to work off the clock, failure to pay the full minimum wage when tips aren't enough, and even workers not being paid **anything** by their employer. This is, of course, fueled by fear of employer retaliation and lack of an actual avenue for restitution. Want to claim your $75 in unpaid wages? Hope you like being unemployed while you fight a multi-year court battle, if you even realized the wages were missing to begin with.

Well, not really. Under capitalism, it isn't the person who added the value that gets to own the product. Instead, ownership over accumulated capital rests with whoever owned the starting capital, not with whoever did the labor. It isn't the case that workers contract out of their product for a wage. They never owned the products to begin with so they can't make contracts with it. Rather, workers contract out their *labor itself*, which is spent producing things that their employer owns. The worker never owns the product of their labor. They only ever own their wage.
@_date: 2013-05-10 08:32:45
Capitalism also requires violence. That's why, historically, force has been deployed to create private property and markets where before there had been none.
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:50:46
Under US law this is legal so long as the amount tipped out does not exceed 15% of the server's actual tips and it doesn't bring anyone's total wages for the pay period below minimum wage. That said, not only is minimum wage far too low to live on but enforcement of labor laws in the US is a joke. It's almost always more costly for the workers to seek enforcement than to just suffer the wage theft. As the Wobblies say, "there is no justice for workers in the capitalist courts."

Unless that government has no monopoly on violence. That's a moot point anyway because the anarchists in that picture *didn't* establish a government.
@_date: 2013-05-11 05:15:50
The anarchist movement is replete with violence. The first time the black flag was flown over a city it was after pillaging the police department for arms with the workers chanting "Bread or Lead!" as they barricaded the streets. Anarchists have fought in multiple civil wars. The CNT-FAI militias numbered in the tens of thousands. The RIAU numbered more than eighty thousand infantry and twenty thousand cavalry. Anarchists fought at Kronstadt and Shinmin. They fought in the Mexican Revolution with Zapata and in Nicaragua with Sandino. Anarchists have killed monarchs and ministers and clergy and many other members of the bourgeoisie. They've razed buildings and looted churches, robbed banks and pillaged bakeries. Anarchists have shed blood on five continents in the struggle against capital.
You can dislike the violence, you can hate it, you can believe it's misguided, you can believe that there's another way. What you *cannot* do is pretend that the entire hitherto history of anarchism wasn't "real anarchism" because you don't like the definition of the word and you think it's yours to decide.
Anarchists revolt against capitalism and collectivize land and means of production. We take what should already be ours by right and we set up radical experiments in democracy and autonomy. That's what anarchism *is*. That's what everyone who ever called themself an anarchist all throughout history has done. Weighed against this history, the opinion some guy on reddit who says it didn't count as being a part of our own movement because of some semantic quibble means nothing at all.

It could also be because restaurant sales have slacked. I make less than $10 some nights because I only get three tables and their checks combined are less than $60. My employer won't make up the difference for that shift because it's calculated by pay period.
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:58:21
And then, since that's illegal too, you can sue your employer for your job back. Then you get to spend years unemployed and fighting an expensive and difficult court battle over what amounts to your employer's pocket change.

As long as the vast majority of the Earth's people lack enough capital to self-sustain, contracts aren't really voluntary. You *must* contract with someone who has capital and thereby sacrifice the fruits of your labor to a boss. The history is clear. Anarchism has been an anti-capitalist movement for over a century and a half.
@_date: 2013-05-10 16:28:14
Scrod may be arrongant but they're correct. Anarchism has a long history of anti-capitalist struggle and these "anarcho-capitalists" are, knowingly or not, trying to co-opt our language.

Capitalism is a lot more than just "voluntary exchange." People have been exchanging stuff since before the written word. Capitalism is much younger than that.

Except that a boss-worker relationship usually isn't symmetrical at all. Unless the worker has very exceptional skills, the boss will have greater bargaining power. If you're poor and unskilled (as most people on the planet are), you need a job more than the boss needs you. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 08:40:34
Anarchists have never really had a problem with using force. I think history is quite clear about that. In fact, there have been multiple, large-scale anarchist militaries.
@_date: 2013-05-10 16:24:23


It does. Capitalists are rulers. That's why anarchism has its roots in the workers' uprisings of 19th century France instead of among those same workers' bosses.

Clearly he thinks that capitalist authority does not stand up to scrutiny.
@_date: 2013-12-31 16:55:49
I'm having trouble thinking of a job where the worker owns the raw materials, the employer owns the machinery, and in which the employ*ee* pays the employ*er* but owns the product. Can you give me an example? I'm having trouble wrapping my head around this.
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:26:05


Your definition of capitalism is way over-broad. Unless it addresses the role of *capital*, your definition needs work.
@_date: 2013-04-29 23:57:33
Yeah, that's way too much credit. My managers don't do shit. One literally does nothing but come in and take the money, occasionally stopping to discipline anyone who violates the non-existent fraternization policy.
