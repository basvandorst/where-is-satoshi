We had no idea.

Bitcoiners always seem to have friends who are completely amazed and in awe when shown how it works. 
I showed some friends and nobody gave a shit.

Yes you are. Just not through them. Makes perfect sense for a money transmitting service. Stop using them if you don't like it.

Mass adoption any day now.

Use some common sense. 
Really, all these scams are so transparant yet Bitcoiners always seem to have problems recognizing even the most obvious ones. 
I guess it has a lot to do with greed. The promise of free money.

Reality bothers you i see.

If you actually did search you would know the answer.

Finally some self awereness why people make fun of this sub. Now that's what i call real enlightenment.

Nobody wants to hear this.

Bitcoin isn't riskier than fiat?
No way, just no way you actually truly believe this yourself. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 19:06:16
Offline of course. Where else would you store your internet money. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 16:26:31
The same reason they don't support 1000's of other money systems. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 20:24:05
Oh man, is this shit ever gonna stop. 
If they were interested in Bitcoin they would've used it. Obviously they aren't and i can list 50 possible reasons why. 
A few passive aggressive Bitcoiners spamming their customer support won't change this, believe me. 
You people have been trying this spam method for years now and it failed over and over again. How many more years are you gonna try to keep this up?

You nutters scare me. 
@_date: 2015-04-24 08:57:06
You look very stable and sane. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 16:27:58
No, they know what everybody knows. That hardly anybody uses Bitcoin. They have absolutely no reason to start accepting it. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 20:36:56
Of course it's good for Bitcoin! Is there anything ever not good for Bitcoin? I'd say go ahead and spam them like there is no tomorrow!
