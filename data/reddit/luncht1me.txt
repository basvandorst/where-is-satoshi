or 64bit ints.

I don't think you understand what he means by "complex"....
By adding another layer of libraries to handle something that can be done with a 64bit int is called adding complexity.... You're using another library, which means MORE calls, which means LONGER function run-times, which means less performance, which means larger file sizes, which means more server load, which means more energy used to do something that could just be done in a simple manner.

64bit int dude. Easy.

As many people have said.... you DO NOT WANT TO STORE FINANCIAL DATA IN FLOATS.
Helloooooo rounding errors. That leads to lost data and in turn, money.
When a programming language has a perfect way to deal with a situtation natively (In this discussion, it's storing BTC value in a 64bit int), you USE THAT AS IT IS THE SINGLE MOST SIMPLE WAY TO DO IT.
KISS - Keep it Simple Stupid.
When you try doing basic things with an additional library, you're adding waaaay toooo much complexity to such a menial thing. Increased Runtime due to multiple function calls, more energy used by the server, it just is not a good idea. Sure you may feel uberleet by importing a lib and making a function call to get your desired result, and feel like a wizard for not having to actually understand or create your own solution..... but you're just being inefficient, doubling, tripling the amount of computational time it takes to achieve the same result. 
Why would you run 100 meters to your goal if really all you had to do was take a single baby step?
@_date: 2014-09-18 18:44:33
Hmmm, doesn't seem the proper way to do it, as then lots of BTC gets shaved.....
I don't know why you'd want to store in $dollar at all.... btc is simplier.

Hence there's the 'Bitcoin Day' metric! Coins that have not been moved in a long time contribute more to this volume metric than those who have been moved recently. Gives a more interesting statistic imo.

An exchange hack is a completely different thing than a blockchain attack.
For this to happen on BTC, the 4 largest pools would have to come together in secret. Antpool for example has 147,600+ workers on it (147,600+ individual machines). So rough scaling, about 500,000+ existing ASICS would be needed to attempt a 51% attack on BTC's blockchain. That's at today's hashrate - which continues to grow. In a short time, it'll take a million ASICs to attack BTC. What do I mean by 'existing ASICS'? Well you couldn't introduce 500,000 NEW machines to do the attack. With new machines, you'd have to introduce as many machines as there are currently mining to do it - which obviously, is an extremely expensive endeavor. Nobody is going to spend billions of dollars and Gigawatts of power to try and control the BTC blockchain. All of those machines have to be coordinated to write the same illegitimate blocks - it's a huge undertaking. Sure, the top 4 pool owners could do it - but it would have to be in secret for as soon as there's any word of it miners would drop off their networks like flies since BTC miners typically hold a philosophy against ever doing a 51% attack - so the majority would choose to not participate in the pools attempting to do so.
So yes, there is a LOT stopping this from happening. It's much more profitable for pool owners to just keep taking their cut of the pool instead of messing with their status by colluding like this. The reward is control of the blockchain - the risk is losing all your miners forever and never profiting from running a pool ever again.

Unfortunately, new people into the scene can be easily mislead because of this.
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:59:15
It truly only ever became a thing because of the purposeful confusion.
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:58:34
Because it is a scam. It was solely created to confuse people into buying the wrong bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:28:00
I remember mentioning on twitter at some point recently how incredibly easy it would be to 51% attack BCH lol. Just a tiny fraction of BTC miners would have to migrate temporarily to do it. You need a strong network for cryptographic security.
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:33:12
The trees said so after the fact.
@_date: 2019-05-25 09:23:52
Found the guy who bought BCH.
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:57:06
Most BTC miners if they caught wind their pool was colluding with the other big 4, they'd jump ship so fast to other pools to mitigate the chance of 51% control.

nah have this downvote.

Definately! Central banks will try and bring it down, you can count your stars on that. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:03:22
you COULD get someone (or yourself) to code a super clever buy / sell bot w/ the various exchange APIs.... Or instead of trusting your money w/ some code, at least have it pump out ideal situations of when you could manually buy and sell. Cold hard math sometimes is the best answer.

I hate the fact that some places are saying 'the reputation is ruined after today's market manipulation"
Fuck off you central bankers trying to destroy the thing that'll end your vile regime. 
@_date: 2013-05-05 22:00:19
Boom! I love seeing this kind of stuff
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:59:41
Right there with ya! Unfortunately, I did buy $700 worth at $190, just to wake up to $90 prices in the morning today. BUT IM NOT DISHEARTENED. I have another $500 coming in tonight at the low prices! We WILL see $500 / BTC REGARDLESS of how hard this apparent 'central bank attack' keeps up. 
For liberty!

It's gaining some momentum. And with more and more people realizing how bad the current monetary system is.... one can only speculate :P
