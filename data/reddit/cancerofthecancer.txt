has said that they will be back up in the next coupla weeks with this feature, plus other options. He seems to be affiliated with bitinstant, so I guess we will just wait to see what is up.

I hear you on that. I'm trying to get a bankroll going, with the goal of not using any actually money, I've been using the free stuff, and am thinking about investing it once I get a good chunk (1-3 btc) but was looking to see if anybody has had any success with it. I don't know if I am tarded or if its too hard but I cant seem to get anywhere using coinworker.

Love it? Hate it? Never heard of it? I'm new to bitcoin and have been doing some searching. I don't have the resources to mine it. So I have been looking for ways to increase the size of my wallet

from the research that I have been doing I'm just going to have to bite it.

"sucks" might be a  little strong, but it does add another step, which takes extra time, sometimes it can take awhile for blockchain to confirm each transaction.

I honestly don't know, I never took the time to find out exactly how the payout works, but  it did seem like they encouraged you to use the money earned to buy amazon products. I will have to check out bitcointalk.org

Its still usable, but it added in another step. I had been just transferring the btc to my bitcoin address. now the quickest way that I can find is xfer from bitinstant using a cash deposit to mt. gox.
