Give it a try and let us know how it goes
@_date: 2015-02-07 23:35:31
Yes private key is on the back
@_date: 2015-02-08 00:41:07
Yep that's pretty much it
@_date: 2015-02-08 01:49:08
yes, both are gone. The dollar bill first then the card shortly after. If you scroll down you'll see someone got there just a few minutes too late.
@_date: 2015-02-07 23:35:42
yes still there
@_date: 2015-02-07 21:37:30
That requires knowledge that both have value. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 22:28:04
The bitcoins are still there. Should we see how long it takes to be claimed? A week, two weeks, never?
@_date: 2015-02-08 00:06:15
No I haven't. I'm pretty new to reddit. Didn't know there was such a thing...
@_date: 2015-02-07 21:07:52
If they take both they take both 
@_date: 2015-02-08 02:15:26
It's possible. My guess is someone may have recognized the symbol "BTC" and is now doing research on how to unlock the funds. 
Either that or someone just put it in the trash (there is a city ordinance against posting things on telephone poles) 
@_date: 2015-02-07 21:08:25
It's $10 but you get the idea
@_date: 2015-02-08 01:13:16
The qr code you see in the image is the public address, and the private address was on the back.
@_date: 2015-02-07 20:56:12
Follow along 
I'll check the telephone pole every 15 mins :)
@_date: 2015-02-07 21:09:45
Ok I'm watching the pole from 30 feet away. Will try for video :)
@_date: 2015-02-07 21:15:42
Or the worst ;)
@_date: 2015-02-08 00:05:03
It's raining and getting dark, so I'm guessing it's still there. I'll take a look later though
@_date: 2015-03-15 20:08:54
Seattle wood fired pizza company. 
Pretty much the only thing you can buy with BTC that I know of.
@_date: 2015-02-08 05:50:00
It didn't get thrown away, grabbed it. And my guess is that PoleSistah is very familiar with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-07 21:26:31
Magnolia :)
@_date: 2015-02-07 21:16:38
Yeah it $10 but still 10x more than the paper 
@_date: 2015-02-08 01:17:45
Someone grabed it, doesn't seem like it was that difficult
@_date: 2015-02-07 22:21:15
It was pinned to a telephone pole. I'd say that's up for grabs
@_date: 2015-02-08 01:38:52
No it's already been picked up. I don't know who has it though.
@_date: 2015-02-07 21:23:14
@_date: 2015-02-08 05:19:16
I didn't claim it.
@_date: 2015-02-08 00:29:54
Yep its gone
@_date: 2015-02-07 21:20:49
I've watched at least 5 people walk by and not even notice.
@_date: 2015-02-08 05:29:44
Punctuation. Really
@_date: 2015-02-07 22:10:14
This guy doesn't even care :)
@_date: 2015-02-08 00:41:40
OP will not grab it
@_date: 2015-02-07 23:58:44
It's on a well trafficked street, with ok foot traffic. Maybe 1 or 2 people every 15 - 20 mins if its not raining. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 01:29:14
It wont work every time. Stuff like this only work once.
@_date: 2015-02-07 21:00:41
Just to be clear, the private key is on the back
@_date: 2015-02-07 21:43:31
Someone did. Interesting...
@_date: 2015-02-08 01:24:19
Yes I do know the private key for this address, but whoever grabbed it will probably move it somewhere else very soon. At least they should.
@_date: 2015-02-07 22:18:28
Ok, the dollar bill is gone!
I missed the taking though
@_date: 2015-02-08 05:18:03
fine - deleted, you guys are harsh
@_date: 2015-02-07 23:36:21
@_date: 2015-02-08 05:26:54
My account is two years old. Google me i'm not hard to find
@_date: 2015-02-08 00:51:15
It's gone.
