Coinmarketcap is during highly volatile periods kinda slow

(Yeah, this prediction is really bad. (Monte Carlo Simulation)[ is based on randomness, BTC price is based on alot more.

That's the moment you stop taking in customers. This can be done 2 ways, stop all new customers, or increase the minimum order. If they didn't expect it, they should have acted to keep the quality of the site higher.

There are banks with 100 million customers. And coinbase, gdax is not just a local bank. It's the biggest trading platform out there for the US and Europe. 
If you can't handle the traffic, stop allowing more customers. And if you're having problems with the traffic, don't introduce a new coin to your trading system. I'm expecting, like everyone else, a working trade platform.

It is understandable, 1 euro is worth 1.18 dollar.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:13:23
Dont think so, there is a huge wall at 10.000 euro

Lately it is only shit. I've always been browsing rising and new and top "last hour" and last week quality was so bad I don't bother to browse it anymore.

Coinbase is not US only. 32 countries are supported.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:47:16
I don't believe in ether, but you missed out already, bitcoin passed 10k mark 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:14:29
So South-Korea is going to implement the same policy every other big exchange is already enforcing(like coinbase)? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:00:48
The Netherlands has regulated bitcoin under "other assets", so you do have to pay taxes over bitcoin.

Use a secure computer, firewall, virus scans, no teamview, use linux if it is really a "significant amount". Linux has less virusses, however is really hard to use.

Trust the stranger, it's based on transaction fees. This will change in x months, when the network will be updated.

Bitcoins are taxable in a lot of countries.

Sure thats why you created an account to simply only comment in bitcoin. Oh yeah your post history states this,
getting pretty tired of watching red lines.. thinking of selling at a loss and grinding my way up again. sucks but damn.. this never ends.
So and get back to bitcoincash subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:36:41
Youtube is a good source, just look at the likes/dislikes ratio for quality. Search explicitly for stop, limit and market orders. And ofcourse some general videos. You could also use the [GDAX]( site itself, however this isnt sufficient.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:43:31
We need a new bot, words like, "fee, stuck, transaction" should point them to the sidebar.
A lot of people join reddit just for these questions, they probably don't turn to active users. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:29:58
Setup an account at GDAX, it is normally very reliable, except today when the west coast US woke up. Normally GDAX works just fine. GDAX has low fees, and one of the highest prices because it is so reliable.

Are you high? 
But if we're wearing tinfoil hats, the homeless guy from across the street told me 2018 is the year of mars. Mars is better known for being further than the moon, being our destination, our only hope. We are the Elon Musks of our generation, creating, designing, investing in our future and creating a better world for our children. Like an other astronomer once said, “When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favour.”. The key difference is, right now, the odds are in our favour.
On July 31, 2018, we will reach mars. If not then, we have missed the oppertunity, BUT ANOTHER ONE WILL COME IN OCTOBER 13TH, 2020. As an fellow astronomer, you should know why.
After that, Bitcoin has settled on Mars and is mainstream. Bitcoin will then stop being volatile, and be in steady orbit. We have then created a new technology driven by our confidence and investments. 
"The future is vastly more interesting and exciting if we’re a blockchain-faring civilization and a cryptocurrent using species than if we’re not." 
~Elon Musk

You shouldn't use your pocket money to buy bitcoin. Buy candy instead
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:14:52
If you can't handle the orders, stop taking orders. This doesn't mean "crash the whole site", it means: stop taking new customers and work out problems with your current customers. 
The current customers have money stuck in transactions, new customers don't have any transactions yet. 
We can expect this from billion dollar exchange, even the small exchanges do this in my home country. They don't want to crash their site, so they don't allow any registrations. Last week was really amateuristic.
I do agree that some people on this sub behave childish, but it's reddit, one big echo chamber. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:57:37
Okay, I could have used Google to look if it existed... But we're still being flooded. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:10:19
Nope, psychological barrier. 1 euro is worth 1.18 dollar, people stopped buying bitcoin because the 10.000 euro barrier is scary. Currently bitcoin is at 9985 euro, sitting around that value the whole day already.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:23:58
Got the same thing. Made a thread already today though, so that might be it. is being flooded with posts, maybe they decided, just like gdax, to pause everything.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:17:26
From a wallet to an exchange is probably a miners fee, but I haven't used an online blockchain wallet, but you're going to pay a bit. When sending btc from wallet to gdax, gdax itself does not have a fee. 
Coinbase to/from gdax transfers are free though, but I recommend using gdax since buyer and seller fees are significantly lower. Gdax is harder to use, but everyone should be able to understand the basics in max an hour. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:06:45
No customer support. Bitcoins stuck in transactions, money not being transferred and disappearing, site failing during crucial moments, Insiders trading. Enough examples? 
It's indeed pretty easy, but when people are investing thousands of dollars they are expecting a working site, and at least a acceptable customer support. 
Alternatives are bionic, bittrex etc. They are out there
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:06:19
1 bitcoin is 1 bitcoin. The price depends on what people will pay for it. However, some exchanges/wallets have (hidden) fees when transfering bitcoin, and that will reduce the amount of btc you have. Negative? No, just store bitcoins where you want but sometimes it has a small price to transfer/buy/sell bitcoin.

Newcomers aren't newcomers anymore, and these "newcomers" don't Google bitcoin all day anymore.
