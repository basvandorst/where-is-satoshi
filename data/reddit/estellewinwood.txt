Wow, ok. They are clearly having problems then. Who did you decide to open an account with instead? If you don't mind me asking.

Yeah, have you ever tried contacting their support for anything? I haven't gotten any response. I imagine a business account should take longer than a personal account, but a month with no contact whatsoever is ridiculous.

You are absolutely right. Except I am not trying to trap anyone. I am just legitimately curious about the responses. That doesn't mean I am lying though.

Oh man, what a small world it would have been if I was Vanessa. I am sorry to disappoint :(

We don't have a very high balance. So it's not really that big a deal. I just thought it made a fun post.

I agree

That's why I love google

It has been paying off for us. For years. If all crypto were to completely crash and die away tomorrow we still would have come out better off than if we never invested. We aren't rich by any means, but we are doing well thanks to bitcoin. It's important to pay off debt but if you aren't saving and investing at the same time than you are just wasting time. Also I am a transwoman. If I were a transman I would consider my self strait and not a lesbian. I know others may not accept that premise but I do. I therefore act as if I believe that premise. Simple as that. I only mentioned it in the post to show how diverse the crypto community is. I just think it is important to fight some of the more toxic stereotypes that keep popping up about people who invest in this technology.

I suppose that depends on your perspective. If I were to consider myself a crazy male instead of an anatomically unfortunate woman then maybe. However, there is no utility for me in believing that I am nuts. How could I act off of that premise? It would mean every decision I make is fundamentally irrational.. Including investing in bitcoin.
