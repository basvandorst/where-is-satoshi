Because mainstream and radical are antonyms.

All online payment processors charge fees. The bitcoin strategy does not need to be completely free; it only needs to be cheaper.

That's a nice ideology, but I seriously doubt the banks would agree with it.

Thank you for being the first person in this thread to present any kind of actual argument.

How does the concept of "pre-mined" even apply to Ripple? It's not a blockchain-based cryptocoin; there's no mining.
edit: never mind, I was thinking of [the other Ripple](

Interesting. I'm a bit leery of trusting my money to an explicitly religious institution, though. How much of a risk do you think there is of being shut down for "immoral" behavior like pornography, gambling, or revolutionary propaganda?

This doesn't necessarily follow. Why mustn't it stabilize at a point that's merely somewhat unprofitable? Type (c) and (d) profit-negative miners (graycloaks and idealists) might be willing to accept *small* losses.

What's the purpose of this? It seems like those giant canvas sacks with dollar signs from cartoons.

Do you have any recommendations of specific countries to especially consider/avoid?

Mining with your graphics card (GPU mining) used to be the gold standard, but it was overtaken my FPGAs, which in turn were overtaken by ASICs. At this point, unless you're getting your electricity for free, it's cheaper to buy bitcoins than to mine them.
You might want to look at some of the links in the sidebar for more information.

You seem to be repeating what I said in the first part of the post. Are you agreeing? Disagreeing? What is the function of your comment?

Or just a substantially lower price, like 30 mBTC.

The task would have to have all of the following features:
* Difficult for a computer to perform.
* Easy (or at least less difficult) for a human to perform.
* Easy for a computer to *verify* the solution once found. (Otherwise, verifying the integrity of the blockchain is as difficult as producing the blockchain in the first place.)
I can't think of any task that fulfills all three of these requirements.

Thank you, this makes sense. To put it another way: the presence of incentives other than profit will reduce the equilibrium profit below zero.
@_date: 2013-09-01 19:18:14
The forces you name tend to make the price a stable equilibrium, but it's not quite obvious to me whether the equilibrium point will be at negative, positive, or zero net profit.

My understanding is this:
1. It's not a service, but rather software that you install on your own server.
2. It's a paywall, not a donation box.

I was rather hoping for somewhere that the US would have a harder time [swooping in]( on, but maybe there is no such place, short of China or something.

Are there any plans to enable BitMonet to work without Bitpay? It seems that a Bitpay merchant account requires giving real-world personally-identifying information, which in my opinion undermines a major strength of Bitcoin. I strongly believe that the Internet in general, and Internet money in particular, should be anonymous or pseudonymous by default, just like email and reddit and blogs and the rest of it.

Why is it a briefcase? Wouldn't it make more sense to have an ATM be harder to steal?
@_date: 2013-09-01 17:19:48
Exactly. Yes, your bitcoins *might* increase in value by an order of magnitude by the end of next year. But they also might become completely worthless. If people were *sure* that the price was going to go up, then they'd already be buying and selling at that higher price *now*.

Bitcoin needs the tip of a 6 inch or footlong penis.
