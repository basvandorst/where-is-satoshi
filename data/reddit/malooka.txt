I've told people for years, Coinbase are scum who will make things retroactive to stick it to users.
@_date: 2016-01-07 21:44:44
Coinbase always has an excuse to stick it to people.
@_date: 2016-03-26 04:03:28
I've told people for a few years now - Coinbase is just awful.

Being ethical would include sterilizing people on welfare for more than a year so they can't reproduce more low IQ drains on society.  And yes, intelligence is mostly inherited.

In the US (and the world) the bottom 50% of the population are, for the most part, idiots.  You think stealing from the better off to pander to losers is good policy.

Here's my comment.
@_date: 2015-07-09 20:57:22
Coinbase has always been awful.  They actually kick users for buying knives?  Disgusting.
@_date: 2015-07-11 17:06:55
What did I say that was incorrect exactly?  I see this sort of "argument" all the time - name-calling and/or references to this or that, but no facts at all.
@_date: 2015-07-14 19:54:16
Anything that would insulate sellers from being ripped off is frowned upon by eBay. :(
@_date: 2015-07-11 03:35:33
I fail to see the logic in this argument.
Relying on the US dollar is relying on Israelis who run the Federal Reserve to do the right thing over the long term, plus a lot of other factors.
Bitcoin is risky as well, but it it's backed by what is by far the most powerful computer network on earth.
Israelis vs most powerful computer network.
I'll take the most powerful network.

Yes, and when you tell the truth idiots downvote you.
@_date: 2015-11-04 16:30:12
Give me a break.  Are you still taking people's money from bank accounts, then telling them it's "high risk" and sitting on the money for days while not selling BTC?  Your company has always been a scam.
@_date: 2017-05-13 18:49:46
Bitcoin is now Shitcoin.  Stupid Chinese assholes won't do anything to fix it.
@_date: 2015-10-02 22:09:18
The fact they advertise this as being able to mine (what, .08 per month tops?) tells me it's BS.
@_date: 2015-10-27 01:03:36
Withdrawals from last Friday still stuck, and still no response at all from Craptsy.  
They are simply criminals.  But don't worry - their prepaid card rollout is going smoothly!

Here are some facts.  They're criminals.
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:15:44
Not unsubstantiated - substantiated with screen captures and multiple stories from multiple people.  Coinbase might work for you - and they might rip you off.  
I've lost a few hundred dollars just from one small purchase they failed to fulfill - I had planned on buying alt coins with the BTC and this weekend alt coins have gone crazy while  I'm sitting on the sidelines.  Thanks Coinbase!
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:12:36
It's normal for them to lie to customers, yes.
Consider using money orders at a different place, like Campbx.
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:27:31
Coinbase is just a joke.  Jump through their hoops so you can buy BTC - then you can't buy BTC because they exceeded their buy limit.  Then wait days, while they take money from your bank account - only to cancel the order at the last minute because the price of BTC went way up.  
Read some of the horror stories about Coinbase here: 
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:38:45
No evidence aside from stories from many pissed off customers who have all been stiffed in the same way.
@_date: 2013-11-24 04:46:59
I sent in a support ticket and was given a line of BS.  They gambled with my money and won, so want to return the money and keep the BTC profits.  It's called "fraud."
Check out  for the real story on these con artists.
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:53:26
I did TRY to email support, I was given the typical lines and was told it would be escalated.  Of course nothing happened.  I'm learning how typical that is now, too late.
I'm "rather impatient" - after your company lied to me and failed to perform the transaction agreed upon, and you still have my money.  Nice one.
You work for Coinbase so what would you say?  That you've made a fortune stiffing people this week?
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:50:41
Coinbase is a horrible scam.  I attempted to buy my first .5 BTC from them earlier in the week.  I verified everything, they TOOK THE MONEY from my bank account, then canceled the transaction saying it was "high risk."  Less than $300, from a verified bank account, with verified ID, was "high risk." 
BTC went up all week while I waited - so they never had any intention of fulfilling their contract with me.
In the cancellation email they also mentioned trying again in a few weeks.  No thanks.  These con artists can gamble with someone else's money.
Check out coinbasefraud.com for a few stories that will make your flesh crawl.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:22:17
If the prices keep climbing you may not get it at all.  I suggest sending a money order to Campbx via Priority Mail if you're in the US.
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:17:47
The Coinbase "risk algorithm" Olaf speaks of is more than likely an algorithm designed to maximize the profit of Coinbase while using the excuse of "high risk" to steal profits from unsuspecting customers.
Do NOT use this company! 
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:16:32
The fact that Coinbase claimed they would supply me with BTC after I deposited money is not "theoretical" - it's what they claim all over their site.
With no warning whatsoever, they TOOK MY MONEY and THEN decided I was "high risk."  They waited ALL WEEK to inform me of this, so my money was tied up and I couldn't do anything about it.
They still have my money, I've missed out on BTC profits, and can't even try to buy BTC since, again, they STILL have my money.  Hell of a way to get interest free loans and play the market, isn't it?
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:05:33
ksmathers, Coinbase Crusader.  I have evidence in the form of dozens of people, large and small transactions, all getting stiffed.  One person put $100K in and out of Coinbase, only to be told they were "high risk" once the price went up.  
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:26:05
I'm not an affiliate, and I'm waiting on them right now - but CampBX seems to have a better model, in that you can send a money order Priority and within a few days you're in.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:19:00
Last week Coinbase "borrowed" $288.57 from me to purchase .5 BTC - which is now worth approximately $441.
Let's hope they aren't so bad they'll rip off a charity.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:30:31
Hi Cowboy - all I got from customer service were excuses.  The issue was supposedly "escalated" but I've not received one message from them.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:49:20
If Coinbase rips you off report them to the California AG: 
They ripped me off on a small transaction this past week.  Check out  to see what they are all about.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:34:50
They have a "steller" (sic) support team that will ignore you for days on end after they stiff you, believe me.  Don't waste your time.
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:35:38
Yes, you've been busy with all the profit you ripped off from suckers like me.  Keep hiding behind your terms, we'll see what the California AG has to say about your fraudulent practices.  
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:38:07
Avoid Coinbase if at all possible.  Eventually you're going to be disappointed.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:24:44
Don't believe marketing hype from these hucksters. They'll take your money, sit on it, and if the price of BTC goes up they cancel the transaction.
Check out  to see stories from several people.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:19:58
What a joke.  If BTC continues going up watch and see how many orders are canceled as "high risk."
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:39:10
Just one example.  Still waiting.  I can provide PLENTY of examples to back up my viewpoint.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:46:01
You don't need any Coinbase threads at all.  It's pretty well established that they're con artists.  
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:00:49
Coinbase stiffs veterans when they try to buy BTC - take it from me.
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:12:50
*"I don't think you'll have further problems from the risk algorithm going forward in any case. "*
You don't **think** I'll have any more problems?  Well thanks, that makes me want to waste more time and money while you guys play your games.  Nothing has changed about me or my bank account - but I shouldn't have further problems?  Right.
I'll get the word out anyway I can to get people to avoid your scam.  Scamming people like this then hiding behind an arbitrary "agreement."  How you look at yourself in the mirror is beyond me.
is a start.  A complaint to the California AG is another step.
Have fun.
PS You must have lied in your response to me last Friday.  You said you were escalating this but no one ever contacted me about it.  Thanks for ripping me off when BTC was around $576. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:20:29
Coinbase is something.  I will add your story to the collection.
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:48:56
Good luck getting your first transaction through - they're notorious for canceling at the last minute, leaving you with nothing.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:08:45
If you're don't want any BTC, and want someone to tie your money up for over a week, Coinbase IS amazing.
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:13:17
And the reason my funds are tied up is because YOUR COMPANY REFUSED TO FULFILL THE TRANSACTION IT AGREED TO.
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:36:28
Told everyone not to use these criminals.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:09:58
Campx.com takes checks/money orders and they won't sit on your money for a week then lie about you being "high risk."  Money orders to someone who accepts them would be better.  Coinbase won't take money orders because then they wouldn't be able to sit on everybody's money for days at a time.
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:35:14


This ^^^^
is a lie.  It was a requirement for me when I tried to link my bank account.
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:17:04
Here's my proposition for Coinbase: let's go back in time and not stiff me on .5 BTC so I could invest in alt coins and have a few thousand $$$ now.  OK?
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:17:15
It's fraud.  If they flagged people as "high risk" BEFORE taking their money, it would be a different story.
If they didn't say "you may have more luck trying again in a few weeks" - without any additional verification! - it might be a different story.
I'm out a few hundred thanks to these parasites.
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:22:19
I wish companies like Coinbase actually fulfilled their contract to sell BTC instead of gambling with customer's money and sticking it to them.  Check out  for the full story - it's disgusting.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:53:41
It's worse than that, because Coinbase will sit on your money all that time, then not follow through because you're "high risk."  Funny how so many people suddenly become "high risk" when the profit margin is high.
I would sign up at CampBX and send a check or money order.  No fees, the time frame is the same (or better) than using Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:36:32
Coinbase can cancel your transaction any time for being "high risk."
Check out campbx.com and perhaps send a money order?  It worked for me.
@_date: 2013-12-06 07:32:10
Yes they do, and it was their site.  Please, ask Coinbase yourself and stop lying.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:21:27
They aren't a reputable company from my experience with them.  If they don't like being labeled as such they shouldn't play games with other people's money.
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:27:35
There are a lot of issues with Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:59:15
Upvoted 
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:53:04
Sign up at blockchain.info, get an address, and ask they send to that address.  Then you can send it to your wallet.
Do NOT use Coinbase.  
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:56:17
They're quite a scam, to put it mildly.
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:22:49
I just uploaded a scan of my driver's license to Coinbase less than 3 weeks ago when I first tried them.  They asked for it.
Maybe it wasn't a requirement for you but it was for me and others.  Stop saying I "fabricated" the story, you're the one lying now.
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:16:12
Yes, it is why they cancel transactions.
Find me one person who spent $1000+, watched the price plummet, and then got canceled.
I'm waiting.
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:48:36
They don't care, they'll stick it to a veteran near Veteran's Day.
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:01:46
Coinbase is out and out fraud.
They still have my money, and I have nothing - while the value of BTC is going up and up.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:47:30
Yes, that's why I started the website.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:11:12
DO NOT waste your time.
They'll sit on your money, the price will keep going up, then they'll cancel your order after making you wait all week.
I sent a money order to CampBX and it went through within the stated timeframe.  They're more committed to honesty than Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:45:46
Here's some priceless advice - avoid Coinbase!  Contrary to what some here have said they are incredibly sketchy.  Just look at some of the horror stories:
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:45:32
They did not help me out in anyway.  A simple .5 BTC order for less than $300, with verified ID and utility bill, verified bank account - "high risk."  They canceled after the price soared and I was planning on using that to purchase MEC, PPC, and XPM.
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:08:44
Good for you.  They never honored my purchase.
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:51:16
They do.  You can sign up for a new account, then when you try to link a bank account they'll ask for it.  See for yourself then you can come back and apologize if you have any degree of honesty at all.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:39:43
Here's some advice when buying: right now, in the US, use a place where you can send a money order.  That way they won't sit on your money for days then refuse to give you what they promised like Coinbase does.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:37:17
They pulled this with me, then stiffed me when the price climbed.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:49:57
They took the money from my bank account, sat on it, then canceled.  Then it took a few more days to get my money back.  Hope yours goes through!
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:57:26
No, they took my money, sat on it, didn't perform the transaction because of a "high risk" excuse ($300 verified is high risk in what world?).  In the meantime the window to buy cheap MEC and others closed.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:07:36
Coinbase is a joke - they may stiff you if prices go up.
Buy and send money orders to a place that will accept them.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:27:58
DO NOT waste your time with Coinbase.  Send a money order (via Priority Mail or even Express) to Campbx or some other reputable place that accepts money orders.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:38:17
It depends.  If you buy it and the price goes up while you're waiting you may never receive it.
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:08:48
You thought wrong, so I guess you're full of shit.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:13:45
You don't find them STILL sitting on my money appalling, when I've lost out on hundreds in profit - but telling the truth about them is appalling?
I'm not making up anything.  They do what they do.  They want to play games with my money, now we'll play.    
And if you've been ripped off by Coinbase don't hesitate to file a complaint with the California AG, Kamala!  
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:15:52
You aren't going to be able to buy with PayPal, at least it isn't likely.  And stay away from Coinbase.
