This is my worst-nightmare scenario with Coinbase realized.
I've been faithfully using them to buy BTC for a while now, and have never had trouble sending the coins out to my Core wallet.
It's the "When it's time to sell my Bitcoins for fiat, what sort of shit am I going to be forced to go through" factor that gives me greatest concern.
Hope you get your issue resolved :( Being robbed sucks.
@_date: 2017-04-17 20:02:17
So, if I buy BTC from Coinbase, send it to a new address under my control with my Core wallet, send that BTC to another BTC address, that then spends it on a DNM, they will ban MY account ?!

Well, that's the issue exactly. I was home-mining on 120V circuits. Mining with what was available to me at the time.
Seems like the days of supporting 120V circuits are coming to an end, effectively killing off small hobbyist miners.
And yeah, me installing a 240V circuit on my own would probably result in my own death, so...

Question for you then about Autopilot.
Your post actually inspired me to give it a whirl, with not quite as much funding as you have ;)
However, does Autopilot currently, automatically close and reopen channels to rebalance routing, or once it's established a channel, it's effectively permanent until the node operator manually closes the channel ?

It didn't start out this way, but the fiat value of my Bitcoin holdings have now exceeded my cash and stock holdings.
I'd probably say my net worth is about 60% Bitcoin, 40% traditional investments, at this time.

TBH, I'm surprised they lasted as long as they did.

My wife just withdrew less than 4 BTC from her Coinbase wallet an hour ago, and still hasn't hit her Core wallet.
Hopefully it's there in the morning.
EDIT: Took 5 hours, but she got her transaction.

1) Download Bitcoin Core
2) Sync blockchain - This will take a couple days
3) Stop Bitcoin Core
4) Replace wallet.dat in the Bitcoin data directory with your old backup.
5) Restart Bitcoin Core
6) See old coins

I'm surprised Core hasn't done this already. I'm stubborn and always run the Core bitcoind on my node.
Whatever they support is what I'm supporting.
Don't feel like compiling custom shit for signaling.

Waiting for Core to do something.
If it ain't Core, I ain't running it.

Fuck all y'all.
I'm running stock core until they figure their shit out.

I wake up and don't even blink any more, if my BTC stash swings +/- $100k overnight...
Hodlers gonna hodl.
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:15:15
This is pretty spicey.
I was just at dinner last night with an eclectic group of over-40 established friends (software engineers, a lawyer, a VC...), and Bitcoin was brought up; they know I have considerable hodlings from my mining days.
I was telling them about the recent "crash" off $3000 and the current trading price. They asked "What if it all crashes to zero ?"
My response was "I've already sold enough Bitcoin to cover all my mining, electrical, and other related expenses. Took some fiat in profit and bought some nice expensive toys. Everything I'm hodling onto now is a bonus. If it all crashes to zero, oh well. It was a fun ride."
@_date: 2017-07-20 01:52:15
This is terrible and you should feel terrible.
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:45:57


As far as I'm concerned, if it's not Core, it's not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:24:26
Take a piss in a restaurant that doesn't ?
@_date: 2017-06-17 20:41:55
Every day I'm hodling...
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:18:47
That's cheating.
Wish the Core team would take a firmer stance.

The Dark Times started when Avalon went evil with Batch 2 and taught KNC and Butterfly Labs how to become pro-level scammers.
It Dark Times peaked when MtGox imploded.
The Dark Times overran Bitcoin when Jihan Wu went full chaotic-evil.
This brings us to &lt;current_day&gt;.

AFAIK, if port 8333 is the only port exposed on your box, you should be OK, security wise.
In theory, anyway.
