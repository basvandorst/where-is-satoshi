I suppose that's possible, but the coins remain unclaimed so not sure? I'm gutted, it took me ages to build them up. To me it seems Multibit has created this change wallet and paid change into that, but there's no way to access it from my PC?
@_date: 2014-04-09 12:51:43
No, as I said, I sent over some coin to Crypto, which it sent over fine, but it also sent the remainder of my coin to this "change wallet"? I didn't create the wallet, Multibit did, but I don't have private keys for this new wallet?

Hi, I'm not at home at the moment, so will check all this later. OS is Windows 7, and here is the info from blockchain
14DU4CVpTtn4uqxvpVcoYwMY1WSZmMV1vN is my good wallet that I use regularly
@_date: 2014-04-09 10:18:42
I don't this you are right to be hones, and apologise if you are, but when I looked in the log file in my multibit folder, it did mention that it had created 0.423 change. I will post that later when I get home if it helps.
@_date: 2014-04-09 09:42:59
No, I didn't create it, maybe a human did get hold of my keys, but is that possible, nobody has access to the PC I use at home?
@_date: 2014-04-09 10:07:06
Could I not ask Multibit to generate the keys again for the wallet they created? Or is that a stupid question?
@_date: 2014-04-09 09:59:51
No I just have two addresses, well now 3 but one I cant access
@_date: 2014-04-09 12:12:42
So do you think it's a bug, or have I been robbed by someone?
@_date: 2014-04-09 09:36:30
Here are the TX's, 0.10 went over to Cryptsy fine and this is what happened to the rest of my wallet balance
1NuNVDdGnKs6YUM9nyQ4SCw8vLXdp58rDw 0.423 BTC
14DU4CVpTtn4uqxvpVcoYwMY1WSZmMV1vN 0.00013077 BTC
@_date: 2014-04-09 12:55:43
I'll post my log file here when I get home, that should prove it is a "change" issue
@_date: 2014-04-09 12:06:45
OK, can I export all the keys at the same time, or do I have to go into each wallet to do this manually. I only ask because the wallet that the coins were deposited in is not showing up in my Multibit?
@_date: 2014-04-09 10:55:17
If that's the case, what happened to the guy who had virtually the same problem as me yesterday? I can prove from my log file that a change address was created. I can post that here tonight when I get home if it helps?
@_date: 2014-04-09 09:39:05
I haven't sent 0.423 to anywhere, that's my problem. I'm fairly new to this but when I checked my log file in Multibit it did mention 0.423 change??
@_date: 2014-04-09 08:55:36
Hi, no I got it from their official site so I'm sure it's fine. It's definitely a change problem, I have checked the log in my multibit file, and I can see there that it has created a change wallet, but cannot retireve any private keys for it?
@_date: 2014-04-09 09:32:42
Sorry, info from blockchain is here
@_date: 2014-04-09 11:27:31
Yes, the wallet is showing that, but I have no private key for it as far as I can see. Multibit has created the wallet I am sure of this, but haven't provided me with the PRIV KEY?
@_date: 2014-04-09 08:44:05
Yes, I briefly spoke to that guy last night. The more people that highlight this bug the more chance we have of dev looking at the problem. Thanks for the reply.
@_date: 2014-04-09 10:30:37
OK, thanks again. I guess maybe I was robbed :-(
@_date: 2014-04-09 09:51:43
Thanks, I will do that when I get home.
@_date: 2014-04-09 12:53:20
And I would agree with you, only in my Multibit Log File, I can see the same amount there as "change"
@_date: 2014-04-09 12:31:23
? I have every idea what happened, I've seen it in the log file, not really worries about being downvoted, just want my coins back
@_date: 2014-04-09 10:27:08
No, the 1NUNVD address is not showing anywhere in my wallet, apart from in transactions?
Again, I do apologise if you are right about me being hacked, but would it help if I sent the log file part where it shows the change being created?
Thanks again for your help, really appreciate it, I'm gutted about this.
@_date: 2014-04-09 12:52:25
Great help, thanks
@_date: 2014-04-09 08:58:05
HI, definitely got it from their official website, and my wallet has a strong password, it's definitely a change issue. I can see the transaction on blockchain, and the amount has remained unspent, with over 150 confirmations?
@_date: 2014-04-09 09:48:51
OK, I'll run hitman pro when I get home, I'm using Windows 7, software is up to date as far as I know.
