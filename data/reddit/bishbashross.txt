Arguably, there's a stronger incentive to appear to decentralise than to actually do it.

Virtual virtual  currency.

Ha, I love the UK but couldn't imagine not having a passport.

In fiat...
@_date: 2017-04-10 22:51:42
But if everyone can use it, nobody makes more money.

I was also under the impression that computer graphics is still heavily CPU based. I use VRay, a very popular renderer/ray tracer and that is CPU based. Render farms like Rebus are Xeon based. Only recently have GPU Based renderers become more widespread but are often very limited compared to there CPU based alternatives. See Iray or Vray RT GPU. They also have issues with limited memory.
In fact I'm inclined to believe you have got it the wrong way round.
TL;DR Are you sure?

I think they have crypto in the history of money section.

Does the Amazon one work if I order from Amazon.co.uk?

I am in Mile end and would buy 32 for 200 quid if you like?

I believe  except bitcoins already, though I don't have an account to confirm this.
@_date: 2011-08-04 18:03:09
I am in London. How many bitcoins are you talking about?
@_date: 2013-01-21 19:51:11
This is all just speculation on my part, but I wonder if those recent large Bitcoin purchases are somehow related. If Bitcoin really is being considered as a payment option then there could certainly be a lot of money to be made with a little insider knowledge.

A problem occurred while scanning or using the QR code. Please try again. This is the latest version I think, on nexus 4.

I think they're just operating under the assumption it's VAT exempt, until they get are ordered otherwise. VAT would pretty much kill legitimate Bitcoin use in the UK.

Cool service, good luck!

Sorry, probably wasn't clear enough. I mean when we purchase Bitcoin with GBP  do we have to pay  20% VAT like Silver?
@_date: 2013-07-08 19:03:40
How does this affect VAT. Will we have to pay VAT on Bitcoin purchases?
@_date: 2013-10-29 14:27:27
This is a good point. Now that BitPay offers 0% transaction fees it doesn't matter either way. I know they can convert to fiat immediately so I imagine that could be a consideration as well. I'm guessing Bitpay doesn't just dump them on an exchange?
@_date: 2013-06-01 15:59:43
Aye, It's a great pub too.

Why are posts that clearly break the rules of the sub being allowed? I'd rather an unbiased sub than one the moderators are free to manipulate to their own benefit. Whatever your qualms with Quark it doesn't belong here.
