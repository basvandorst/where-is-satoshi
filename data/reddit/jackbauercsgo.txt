I'm not well versed enough to argue specifics of USD vs USDT.  What I *do* know is that these insane leaps on little volume often begin on Finex.  Also, they fund through "Tether" (which some say is fake money), and the owner has admitted to playing games with banks in order to move cash off the exchange and into fiat.  The artice on "spoofy" did a good job of bringing all of Finex's shady moves to light.  I'm not here to argue if "spoofy" is real or not, but that article had some pretty damning evidence that makes it obvious Finex is shady at best.

I have a number of problems with your statements.
* 1) That is not a perfect exponential curve.  That curve is approaching infinity in the period of 1-2 months while it's been valued at $1,000 or less for 7 years.  The curve is FAR too steep. Over a couple years, absolutely - I'd agree with you there.  Within 60 days, HELL NO.  
* 2) While you mention a "high net worth individual" may be the cause of the BFX action, I would disagree on the premise that there's currently no way to add or remove funds to the site.  And this one individual is estimated to be swinging $100 million or so based on buy/sell walls that are added and removed in an orchestrated way (within seconds of each other, multiple times).
* 3) Many of the recent sudden increases in price were in direct opposition of most analysts, "TA experts", and long term bitcoin veterans.  Nothing about this latest run up has felt normal or organic, and almost anyone would tell you it's clearly been manipulated in some way or another.  Just as people start to guess BTC is going to fall, a sudden burst of 10,000 market buy orders push the run up another $250... and guess what exchange keeps leading the charge?...
* 4) Adoption has NOT increased for BTC, as many of the sites and services I use first hand have refused to accept BTC as a currency.  I remember when several of my sites used them, but not anymore - removed due to volatility. 
 Also, dark markets are moving over to other mediums as well.  This all leaves me to believe BTC is being given a high % of speculative value, instead of value from real world usage.  Additionally, BTC has been rebranded "internet gold", but those of us who've been around long enough know that was never the intention - it was to have a decentralized currency anyone could spend.

Curious, what would happen in this case? The money sent is forever lost in purgatory? Or is refunded at some point?
