That gallon of milk cost about an hour of work. Now it costs about 20 minutes of work. That tracks closely to the dollar but not bitcoin. How do you expect me to set a salary for someone in bitcoin if it is so unstable?

I just mentioned the answer... just cause you don’t like it, doesn’t mean it’s not right

The argument? I mean it is a bubble... that’s the whole point. It’s literally the bubbliest bubble in history. Anyone who denies that just seems to be intentionally deceptive, almost as if they have something to gain out of deceiving people to think it’s not a bubble. I’m all in for riding the rollercoaster and seeing gains, but denying it’s a bubble? It’s just so ridiculous

Donate gains from bitcoin so you can deduct it from your taxes and get Reddit karma all while doing it ��

And getting gang raped by a volatile, unregulated scammer prone coin is better? Hard to put confidence in your life savings in a coin more unstable than the Ruble. Rather hold my money in US treasury bonds, the most secure in the world.
Not saying I won’t play this slot machine of a market. But when talking about where most of my money is gonna sit you bet it’ll be somewhere more secure.
Don’t let ideology and your hate for big banks make you a bad investor.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:45:40
But how do you report losses/gains if its a currency? If I buy something with bitcoin do I report that? Is that purchase all from gains or from my original investment?
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:07:09




This sums it up pretty well. The federal reserve is that boring responsible guy who holds growth down to stabilize the economy that crashed after the last get rich quick scheme went bust. And it’s boring to learn about all that. Why learn about that when you can just focus on the next get rich quick scheme that may crash the economy! 
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:48:35
Sounds like your too deep into it to appreciate that being more volatile than the Ruble is kind of a failure of what was originally set out for with Bitcoin. By all means ride out the bubble and make tons of money (or lose it all). But don’t blind yourself so much by the gains that you no longer are willing the recognize the negative aspects of this currency. The more volatile bitcoin is the less relevance it has as a suitable currency and thus the greater the bubble grows.
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:31:14
Does anyone in their right mind actually think bitcoins market cap could hit $17.5 trillion? That’s about a third of the worldwide market. Not only is that ridiculous but spreading the amount of volatility in the current bitcoin market to a third of the worldwide market would be a literal catastrophe in the making.

Realistically though gold won’t become worthless overnight. It’s a real world scarcity that props up its worth. You can store gold under your bed and be confident that it’s value won’t depreciate into non existence. Can’t say the same about bitcoin. At a fundamental level it isn’t real. Worst case scenario it could be hacked and it becomes meaningless (almost certainly impossible). But a far more likely scenario is that people stop caring. That the market shifts. That a new crypto becomes the center of focus. The moment a new technology comes about that makes bitcoin obsolete its over and its value is gone. The list of new potential cryptos is unlimited. And there’s truly nothing special about Bitcoin that would make you go back once you left, like you may with gold. Bitcoins entire worth depends on how many people are in. And currently its price is high because people are mistakingly conflating increased investments with increased implementation of bitcoin as an actual currency. And it’s worth as a currency is only there is people are actually using it. If a new technology comes along and noones using bitcoin then its worthless.

I’d trade it all for a little more
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:05:04
Hopefully but maybe not. And probably not. Bubbles pop bigger the more people are involved. And Bitcoin is hitting the mainstream on a level not seen in previous bubbles. Every market is a movement of entropy and an organization of that entropy following basic laws of thermodynamics. Bitcoin is no different, it just does it in a different and new way. The problem with it now is if the market value could ever actually be where it is now. It’s over $100 billion and it’s hard to see how it’s capturing that much of the e commerce market. It’s not. It’s only valued that high because of the bubble. In the future it could hit that point but it would have to be able to hold down its two most pressing issues: volatility and energy consumption. It won’t be able to function adequately as a tool of transaction if the value changes more than be Ruble. No business is going to want to use it for transactions. The same is true with energy costs, they’re far higher than the energy required for more traditional transactions. These problems overshadow the benefits of a block chain and make it hard to see its market cap growing much past where it’s at now without it being a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:04:51
Maybe the whole crypto market, but that would mean a decline in the BTC price as other cryptos fall into favor. The reason no single currency will ever have as much lasting value as gold is because at any moment it’s value can be completely worthless. The crypto market as a whole will never be deemed completely worthless. But bitcoins certainly could be.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:28:01
Why would this be a bad thing? The whole point of decreasing the value of the dollar is to decrease past debts. I certainly would never take out debt with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:42:10
Pretty sure that’s what we call a bubble... you have to ask yourself if there is any real value or reason it’ll hit $100k or why you picked that number. If not then by all means ride out the rollercoaster, just be aware of what every bubble looks like and that being at the highest peak of any bubble ever doesn’t build much confidence in continued gains
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:07:25
The fundamentals of Bitcoin may infact make it unusable. With no central authority to regulate the market you can get extreme volatility. Volatility of a coin makes it pretty unusable as a coin. Compound that with a complete inability to assess the true value of a meaningless internet coin which doesn’t build confidence as a source to store your money. And then the extraordinary energy needs that requires almost 10X more electricity than traditional banking that means economic waste. The biggest factors contributing to the lack of usability may be issues that will persist.

Printing money is a valuable tool to help limit the impact of a huge debt burden. You can pay down the debt or print more money. Leaving significant debt for future generations is stealing from them, inflation helps to decrease that burden.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:11:01
Bitcoin is volatile... the whole premise of it being an effective currency has failed and now everyone’s here to just ride out the bubble. If you’re going to criticize other economists at least be honest about what’s going on here.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:15:34
I said Bitcoin is in a bubble because of the volatility that takes away from the real world function. And you responded “Um, No”. Whatever dude. If you’re this hostile to any discussion on this currency and so defensive about proving your own intellect then maybe you should take a step back and sit on the sidelines for a bit. Cool off dude.
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:16:22
That seems like a pretty good argument of why not to invest. Better to pick a coin that’s expanding equally to the overall expansion of the pie. If the overall crypto currency pie is increasing at a faster rate than bitcoin then probably best to stay away from bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:08:33
Or it’s too late. Hard to really tell. That’s what a bubble is. Either way hard to suggest that Bitcoin market cap actually is over $100 billion. It’s only there now because of hype which suggests this isn’t the time to get in.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:35:27
I mean maybe. But you have to see where the benefits and drawbacks of such a system would be. Right now running a system with a centralized bank and using incentives from that bank to promote different internet protocols is less energy consuming than a block chain whose only benefit is decentralization. The benefit seems more ideological than practical, and worse it seems like the drawbacks of a blockchain are economic. When your benefits are ideology and drawbacks are economic that’s not a winning market strategy.

Why can’t you respond in good faith? Why must you lie to push an argument? Where did I say Nazis can’t freely organize? I said good luck trying to get a gig as a Nazi, a TV show or a movie. Let the free market of our cultural decisions determine who gets the microphone. 


LOL you have every right to be an asshole. Don’t expect to keep your job or friends. 


Again lying and arguing in bad faith. You know I never once suggested having government involved. I talked about community criticism. Why lie?


Lol the “alternative” is the world we live in right now. And it’s far better than the hell hole dystopia you dream of. We live in a society now where the type of humor you appreciate leads to your friends not wanting to associate with you, your job wanting you out and no one wanting to hire you. It’s fucking great. Teach you to not be such a fucking bigot and all done with the help of the free market and no government intervention. God damn America is great.

Oh god you did not just try to pull a “Michael Scott is the victim” argument... good god you’re too far gone in your own dystopia world view.


Nope. Lies and propaganda are hidden in joke. Joking about how black people are stupid and Mexicans are lazy is a way to justify the shit policies that whites perpetuate against them. You hide those lies and propaganda in jokes. You want to live in a dystopia where white men hold all the power and get to make fun of everyone they want to. Go ahead. Don’t expect to have a job.

wat. Where have you been? Bitcoin has seen some of the largest hyperinflation of any modern currency...

You really don’t understand what 1984 was about... please go back and read it. It’s about government controlling speech. At no point does it suggest that a community shaming someone for being a Nazi is bad. Stop citing the book if you never even read it. Not booking any comedy gigs because you’re a racist isn’t “1984”, it’s the market and community’s working as they should
@_date: 2019-02-11 02:31:04

And you’re point? You’re the one defending the characters jokes and saying his type of humor is funny. Carell is pointing out that it’s not funny and the Office only works if you appreciate that. Literally going against everything you said

@_date: 2019-02-11 03:15:33
Well if you’re laughing with Michael Scott then the joke really is on you... the show is literally making fun of you and that type of humor.
@_date: 2019-02-10 21:12:09
You’re defending unfunny. Look at any of the best humor of the past decade and you can see that it never focuses on attacking individual groups of people. It’s lazy and unfunny. The Office is arguably one of the best comedic works of our generation and the only humor that actually attacks individual groups is from Steve Carells character where the joke is on him and you laugh cause of how unfunny, stupid and an asshole he is. Sorry that you identify more with his humor and are scared that society is pushing past you. You’re a snowflake that’s terrified of the changing world, worried that humor that makes you feel superior to others will no longer be accepted. And it’s honestly not. Try to get a major TV show, movie or stand up gig with that type of routine these days. Good luck lol. 
Not sure why you’re still on about 1984. Clearly you’re wrong and didn’t read the book. It’s about government control. To suggest that a Nazi not booking comedy gigs is “1984” is appalling. There’s nothing worse than a world where someone so unfunny and racist could book comedy gigs and be cheered. What a dystopian nightmare that would be. Far worse than anything 1984 imagined. And yet that’s how many minorities lived for decades in the past.

What freedoms have I been chipping away at? Letting a Nazi book a comedy gig? I supported a community that criticizes and doesn’t book unfunny comics who can only make fun of groups of people to get laughs. You claimed that was 1984esque lol. By all means point to when I ever suggested the government should get involved... god you’re dumb

@_date: 2019-02-10 20:50:33
Lol clearly you haven’t read it. Funny how you couldn’t answer my previous statements. Where in 1984 did it say that not giving comedy gigs to racists was authoritarian? The book is about a government controlling speech. Having the free market and communitys say this speech is unacceptable is the exact opposite of 1984. Like you couldn’t be more wrong. 
And how much of a degenerate asshole do you have to be to scream 1984 when someone says “hey trans jokes aren’t funny”... that much of a snowflake bro that you can’t handle any criticism of what you find funny?
@_date: 2019-02-10 19:55:59
I’m not being a gatekeeper I’m just stating a fact. It’s not funny. The joke that is being made is a joke at the expense of someone else. There’s no humor in that. The humor is tied to a belief in superiority and the only reason someone finds that type of humor funny is because they believe themselves to be superior to the target of the joke. I’m sorry you’re such a fragile snowflake that you can’t handle being called out for being an unfunny pos but that’s a fact.


Lol says the person promoting attacks on a minority group. Sounds like you need to read 1984. 1984 is about government censorship not you protecting your own fragile ego from your community that doesn’t find you’re offensive jokes funny. God how dumb can someone be to cite 1984 and not even understand what it’s about? Please point to the part of 1984 that says everyone deserves to be protected from criticism from their local community... and then using that nonsense to defend your shitty jokes. God what a snowflake
@_date: 2019-02-11 13:27:04
