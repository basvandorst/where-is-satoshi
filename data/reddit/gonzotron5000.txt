Spend enough time in a service industry and you will discover that most people only survive on cobbled together routines and "common" knowledge. Ask them to think about who they are or what they are doing and you will get canned answers. 
You can learn some interesting things from alot of people but the only truly intelegent people will create something useful.

I'm a firm believer in immutable block chain. It's not trust less without immutability. When you have to trust an entity to handle your transactions it's no better than a bank. This is why etherium  classic is surviving. The forked etherium chain can be changed to the benefit of the etherium foundation.

At first glance this is baffling.

My assumption is they have made a leap in efficiency for their mining hardware/software solution. This will be used to mine small amount of BTC to be then colored and used in a separate micropayment system. 
I wonder if they have made such a leap in efficiency that it makes it cheaper to mine on this scale than to buy. They may be betting that the price is going to the moon as well.

I think the assumption is that big miners dump most if not all of their BTC block reward onto the market. If they constrain thier hashtrate they are receiving less BTC and dumping less on the market. 
Since the same amount of BTC is created regaurdless of total hash power that reward, im assuming, goes to smaller miners that will HODL.

If I understand correctly, if we have an 8mb limit we will still be at about .5mb blocks at current usage. This would give full nodes some time to adjust with demand. 
The only thing it does not account for would be a spam attack that would fill the block up to 8mb and knock the nodes incapable of handling it off the network. I don't know what the repercussions or the severity or the feasibility of something like that would be. I read that the 1MB block limit was to prevent a spam attack and and a jump to 8mb (according to this article) would open that up again. 
I think I favor a floating limit over a short term fixed increase over 2 to 4 mb, based on this article.

frictionless entry to the bitcoin ecosystem of micropayments. Device to device micropayments.
@_date: 2015-09-23 15:20:18
This is an attempt to make bitcoin frictionless. Just plug in a device with one of these chips and it will pay for whatever service it needs like a wifi adapter paying a router for access. This device does not need the user to set up a wallet and password. There is no need to load it with bitcoin since it can mine it itself. I do think that this assumes BTC price will go an order of magnitude higher to make it work.

Install app, create account, attache bank account, buy BTC, point the app at the thing you want to buy. Repeat that manually evertime you need to buy something. Dont forget to keep the your BTC wallet topped up. Make sure that wallet is backed up and secure. 
We dont really know but the proposed idea is that a consumer device with this chip can purchase services without user interaction. The miner is there to provide funds to make the trade. The user provides it with power (something that it would have needed anyway) to get BTC. The cost of powering it goes up and no additional accounts are needed. 
There are still alot of unknowns (like the cost of this device in a consumer product) so I dont think its reasonable to say that it is "at best useless" when its not fully released and one can imagine use cases for such a device.

@_date: 2015-09-23 15:06:31
The going theory is that the mining chips come along for the ride to mine for 21s pool and clear tiny transactions for free - transactions that would normally cost more than the amount transacted. Envision a router and a wifi adapter that both have these chips embedded. The router could immediatly recieve payment in exchange for the wifi cards access to the internet. No user interaction or payment methods or accounts needed other than a wifi adapter loaded with BTC. This is what i think they mean by "frictionless".
@_date: 2015-09-24 19:32:56
Yeah thats one of the mysteries and I think its even only $0.05 a day.  Im guessing they are anticipating another bubble or they will use the satoshis for colored coins. Another possibility is they expect that devices will be buying *and* selling services to augment the mining income on the device. What little amount of literature there is eludes to this. The API will provide onramps as well from non 21.co devices to purchase from 21.co devices.

Sharp increases in mining difficulty lately. Dont expect a short term profit and if the market stays flat expect maybe a slim profit.

This is my own jaded experience mining in US with a few ASICs a couple years ago. It was fun for the cutting edge nerdy thrill but I barely got a ROI. 
EDIT: Here is a rough cost analysis on an antminer S7 (about $1500 w/out power supply)
EDIT2: So you may double your money if prices stay the same. You will have to decide is it worth it to tend to this process for one year for ~$1500 profit. after a year you will want to reinvest to stay competitive or just live with reduced income due to rising difficulty factor and reward halving next year. If you take that and reinvest you are not profiting in dollars but you are accumulating BTC below market value. The market could tank, new technology could flood the hash pool and squeeze you out. lots of considerations my friend. Good luck and have fun should you decide to do it.

Here is the way I see it. Currency is a stake in the economy. I go to work and and contribute to the economy and get dollars in return. My work on a  a widget allows others to provide a service with that and so on. Things work well and the economy grows. With  a deflationary currency my stake in the economy grows since I contributed first. Then as the process continues those that contributed after me have thier stake grow  as well and so on. Inflating currency reduces my stake in the economy when more currency is created and then distributed to others at the whims of the currencies creator. IMHO the latter situation is what bitcoin aims to remedy.
