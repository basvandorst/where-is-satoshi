I would run an LN node &amp; get paid for the service.  
And so would many other people - leading to further decentralization!

They'd be missing out on real fees from other people's transactions.  
Opportunity cost.

Lightning is working great on Litecoin. It's done.   
UASF SegWit gives us 2-4 times the capacity w/o LN too.

 * Biggest ASIC manufacturer  
 * Propaganda media (bitcoin com)  
 * Several largest mining pools  
 * Some ragtag coding outfits  
 * Now the top payment processor  
Ruled by the same couple people. And I thought Bitcoin was decentralized?

True, but not enough since those few people are blocking protocol upgrades for millions &amp; putting **other people's money** at risk to the tune of tens of billions.

I meant it's mainly psychological - I suspect people no longer trust wallet estimations and set the fees higher and higher in this vicious cycle.

Take some profit at 5K or just hold for now?

Is the button grayed out?
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:24:13
Sorry, but I think there is a merge button there somewhere - ready to be clicked.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:23:38
If there's a "Merge" button visible to the maintainer I consider it ready :P

I've got a solid solution for blockchain.info V2 APIs implemented on a Skyhook.  
Somewhat of a custom approach, if anyone is interested.
@_date: 2016-07-25 19:20:11
That error is due to the bc.i V2 API, correct.  
My solution (well, any solution for bc.i V2) entails a number of steps, some outside of the machine itself, I've documented them here (EDIT, fixed link):   
So far no one volunteered a cent :(  
Depending on your tech skill &amp; setup (in-house, a shop elsewhere, servelet) - fewer or more steps are required.

What a pile of crap (around 5 min 10 sec): [Bitcoin was created before Sept 11th]( !  
The rest of the scam is of similar quality. :(

What a pathetic bootlicker.
