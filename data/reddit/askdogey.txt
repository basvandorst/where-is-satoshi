1. I'm up to 5 pull-ups now. 
2. My friend took me to the baseball game we sat in really, really, really good seats. 
3. I learned I could use a wine stopper to preserve the bottles of beer for a day or two. My beer from 2 days ago tastes great still.

1. I was able to update and submit my resume despite working crazily for 14 hours. Hoping for the best... 
2. I finally got around to eating some leftovers that have been in the fridge for 4 days. Still tasted delicious, plus now the fridge is clear! 
3. My bike pedals came in the mail. Can't wait to try them out.

I am interested in Bitcorn.
@_date: 2014-07-09 04:07:38
It looks like we'll both be doing pull-ups for the next month!

Hit up Sake Zone on Clement for mediocre sushi. Then hit up Ramen Underground in Japantown for mediocre ramen. Mediocre yes, but fun to support the currency. 
Then hit up Cups and Cakes Bakery on 9th St for a cupcake. 
Then once you're hungry again find out where the Curry Up Now truck is and order a curry burrito. 
Also catch an sfgiants game if you can. There's a ticket seller on craigslist that takes bitcoin. 
Also follow  on Twitter.

1. My new sunglasses came in the mail. Just deal with it. 
2. I had a delicious burger and fries. 
3. I took a shower. That's a rarity when working from home.

1. Downloaded and watched snowpiercer. Really good Sci fi, worth the watch. 
2. I ate a drumstick ice cream cone. 
3. My cousin sent me some pics from her vaca in Japan. Really cool.

7/9 
1. I worked from 9am to 10pm. But learned more things I guess and am better at my job. I will be asking for a raise soon... 
2. The lady made really delicious chicken. I ate 4 thighs. 
3. Did just 3 pull-ups, but I did em. And even though it was late, I did my Python lessons. Diving into conditionals now. Fun stuff. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 16:14:02
1. My friend gave me a kick ass coffee mug. 
2. I did 4 pull-ups. Haven't done pull-ups in probably half a year, so need to start again. 
3. Keeping up with my Python lessons, did another one last night right before sleep.

Merchants don't need to discount their existing margins. I only meant to pass the savings from not using a credit card processor onto the consumer. It doesn't affect their bottom line at all and there's no risk. Similar to a cash discount vs credit card when buying goods locally. The few % in savings goes a long way in attracting buyers.

7/11. It's 5 mins past 7/11... I got home late. 
1) went to a baseball game. Giants won! 
2) took my bike for another ride. Getting better on my new bike. 
3) I had the greasiest pork skin and belly sammy ever for lunch. Then I had 2 scoops of ice cream for dessert. This is how to live life to the fullest.

1. Rediscovered one of my fav bands from my younger years: alkaline trio
2. Bought a beer pack, looking forward to drinking it 
3. Visited my cousin and aunt. Always a great thing to spend time with family.

This is what I've been using, very basic and easy to follow.

1. I smoked my last cigarette. I don't usually smoke but I had a leftover pack from something. Now it's killed so no more of that. Which is a good thing. 
2. I'm encouraged about pursuing a new job to get myself out of this current hell hole. 
3. 7 pull-ups!

Just ate at Sushi Zone last week on Clement who also take bitcoin. 
Payment was awkward. They presented the QR code to me from their blockchain.info account on a laptop. I keyed in the amount on my Android app and sent it through. They wanted to wait for a confirmation before dismissing me, so I said I would wait back at my table rather than standing at the counter for 10 mins. POS could definitely be improved.

1. I had time to watch Noah again. Even better the second time around. 
2. Got a lot of things accomplished at work. 
3. 6 pull-ups, Wooo! 
@_date: 2014-07-22 06:45:22
1. Obviously I'm not good at keeping up. I blame my busy  work, which I've eluded in several posts. Luckily, rsmoz says still wants me to keep going and won't penalize me. Such awesome. 
2. I bought a new tshirt. I like it. 
3. My dog has been sick for a few days too. Diarrhea and bloody stools. That also took me off of this thread. Fortunately she's a lot better today. Solid poo ftw! 
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:26:46
1. I started teaching myself Python from YouTube videos. Hope to stay motivated. 
2. My gf gave me a leftover egg crossiant sandwich. 
3. I finally took a broken lamp to get fixed. It's been almost a year. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 03:03:26
Coke and hooker party. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:37:52
I realize this is pretty hard. I pretty much work when I wake up til when I sleep, so nothing really happens in my daily life, especially on weekdays. 
1) my mom bought me a wallet. I probably won't use it but it's the thought that counts. 
2) the lady cooked a really delicious fish for dinner. 
3) I ordered a tri-tip Sammy from the corner store instead of the usual. It was surprisingly good.

7/7 in a grumpy mood cuz I have to work today so let's try this out. 
1. Finally watched Noah. I love all Aronofsky movies. Noah started really interesting but ended a little slow and predictable. 6.5/10. 
2. Put in another hour into learning Python. Using code academy in conjunction with youtube.
3. Met a really cute waitress at the noodle restaurant. She asked me if I wanted anything else when it was last call for food. I said no thanks.

Thanks guys. I guess I wasn't the best candidate for this. I have a pretty hectic life and schedule at the moment. But this did teach me to more actively seek out and find positive things in my life, even when none are apparent or obvious. One last hoorah:
1) As you may know if you followed my posts, I hate my job. Item 1 today, I nailed my second interview for a new company earlier today, and I expect the 3rd (hopefully final one) next week.
2) I'm leaving on vacation next month. It will be a well deserved one, the first after 18 months of grueling work. I did a lot of planning and plotting yesterday, and got around to booking my hotels too. I kept procrastinating the longest time because of work.
3) We finally found an affordable but qualified dogsitter for our 2 week vacation!

Gotta start replying here cuz my app doesn't support going that deep into a thread. 
1) I lost $300 at the casino, but at least me and my friends had fun. We talked about bitcoin. 
2) I rode my bike all over the city and had a great ride. 
3) my dog attracted the attention of bikini bathers at the park. I got to chat with them a bit.

I use Square and PayPal for my "business" which are about 2.75-2.9%. Even a 1% savings to the consumer would cover the Coinbase cost. You're right, it wouldn't typically go over 3% for domestic business. But i think what would really shine here is international payments, which eliminate friction from conversion margins and additional fees. 
 I think 2% savings, which nets an actual 1% savings after Coinbase conversion fee, will go a long way in encouraging bitcoin adoption. Most shoppers want to maximize the value of their dollar.

1. It's the weekend! Finally, too much work 
2. Fantasy football is about to start. 
3. I had a free burrito at a party today.

$PCLN is at $1835. Fake news. Besides, per unit price is meaningless. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:14:43
Because I asked about selling, not buying. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:06:53
yes sir
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:12:02
I want one. Pretty steep for a t tho
