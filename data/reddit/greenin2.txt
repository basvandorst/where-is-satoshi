I thought Alcor worked with living people who decided when and where they would want to be frozen?

What's needed is a money that's not issued by the state that is also human-usable. 
What happened in this story is an example of why Bitcoin is not yet ready to be human-money. Trying to take human judgement out of money is a terrible idea for 99% of people, who will make errors like this, and aren't responsible enough to keep their private keys safe. 
The needs of regular people need to be served by Bitcoin as well.

I'm sure Satoshi bought some BTC on MtGox or was mining on separate hardware for a secret stash he could cash out. He knew he couldn't cash out the motherload, but why wouldn't he have at least a few hundred coins for playing the market and taking some profit?

That tweet only sounds like a successful threat to people who don't understand the actual value of electronic cash outside of trading it for worthless shitcoins.
