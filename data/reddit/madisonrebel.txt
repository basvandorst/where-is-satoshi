What if I told you
you could have divested weeks or months ago and waited out the storm?

So wait...you're claiming Trump is only concerned with division, yet you just marginalized someone else into a category of "/t_D troll", thereby dividing this community along your arbitrary lines of tribalism.
Take a big dose of self-awareness, and call me in the morning.

What is Nakamichi? I've heard of the rest, but not them.

People here seem to be missing the point: the US govt seizing all those bitcoins immediately helped legitimize bitcoin as a valuable currency.

Orrin Hatch is pure establishment, but this is impressive. I hope it's in earnest.
As for me, all the Bitcoin I buy is donated to Edward Snowden and Julian Assange. I'm a libertarian. Suck on that, Koskinen, you smirking little shitbag.

I owned 75.
In 2012.
Sold at $5 apiece.
Spent it on a cockatiel.
Most expensive pet ever.

Watson, actually. When I named her I thought Bitcoin was a fun experiment that went nowhere. In all honesty, if someone offered me today's value of the bitcoins for her, I'd refuse. Having a screaming little maniac excited for me to come home every day is priceless.
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:49:55
Oh, it easily was. If someone offered me $225K for her, I'd refuse. Made my life far better than money would have. Money can't buy someone who'll lose their mind with happiness when you walk in the door.
@_date: 2017-07-24 08:20:50
Absolutely true. I mined back in the Radeon 5850 days. Held for over a year as it tumbled down to single digits. Back when $30 was a distant memory and it seemed that Bitcoin might go nowhere. Learned lesson.

Okay...but you do understand that your rights come with the responsibility of respecting the rights of others to do shit you don't like, right?

ELI5: what ultimately will Bitcoin users now have to do after August 1st? Or will current wallets and clients keep working?

Really. It's because they were "smart". You must be so "smart". Tell me what Bitcoin is going to be at 30 days from now. Tell me how this "smart" works in terms of predicting what currencies will do. This should be fun.

I'm not talking about any particular government agency or even the US government. I'm talking about the people who happen to be part of government and those agencies, but who have cohorts all over the world, manipulating economic factors to facilitate their get-rich schemes at the cost of many people's lives. Like currency traders driving business owners to suicide with their manipulation of a nation's currency in order to make a fast profit.
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:32:20
Perhaps I'm misinterpreting the thrust of your argument. I've just noticed, particularly over the last decade, the rise of a sort of pseudointellectual hatred of the "disengaged". If someone isn't as fired up or on the same side of certain issues, or even avoids news altogether, they are seen as some sort of subclass of idiots who shouldn't even have the right to vote. I think it's fair to argue that in today's environment, filled with superficial narratives about unimportant bullshit(from Kathy Griffin to transgender bathrooms), people have less incentive than ever to pay attention to the news or politics. That's not a problem with people. That's a problem with our institutions responsible for informing the public, that have been taken over and turned into either propaganda producers, or noise machines.
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:56:47




Straightforward question: if it were the Democrats, would you feel it was as "wrong"? Or do you only consider Republicans "disgraceful criminals"?
@_date: 2017-06-02 07:15:13
I wouldn't say it's fucking stupid, but it's a poor decision. However, most voters are just that - single issue voters. So, really, no different than the majority of people.
@_date: 2017-06-04 16:34:14
Fair enough. I consider them both reprehensible criminal overlords as well. However, that has to be at least partly hyperbole on both our parts as they haven't managed to revoke the Bill of Rights yet. And sadly, even though I voted write-in and hoped third parties would make a decent showing, they didn't. It was dismal. Either the process is rigged(which it verifiably is in numerous legal ways), or the parties still manage to do just enough to keep life livable in this nation. So when they actually stand up for something that is worthwhile, like protecting Bitcoin users from having their records handed over to the IRS, what choice have we got? We either give them incentive to protect our rights, including privacy...or we give them no incentive. I'm not suggesting that the two-party system is good, but after Trump vs. Hillary and barely anybody other than me voted neither...one must be pragmatic.
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:29:34
What's the fundamental problem? Why should people have to have a full menu of views to vote? There are too many other things going on in the world for all people to constantly keep up with the modern 24/7 news cycle full of noise and distractions and mostly superficial bullshit that doesn't matter. Look at how long Kathy Griffin has been in the news. WHO FUCKING CARES?
@_date: 2017-06-02 07:19:44
Not really. The internet has made politics a lot easier to deconstruct and break down into digestible morsels that give you far more information than CBS or the New York Times. The number of people informed about such things is growing, and growing quickly. Generations are being raised in a world where politicians are increasingly held accountable for their actions.
I don't like Trump, but the fact that Hillary was not elected means that we're not totally fucked yet.

Ross helped create a completely unregulated market utilizing a currency over which the lords of the world have no control. He made them realize their control is not absolute. They will extract maximum punishment for his transgression.
But it cannot be stopped anymore...

The value of Bitcoin dropped about 15% in a single day. What do you expect after the highs lately?
@_date: 2017-06-05 00:26:08
I've done way too much of that shit myself, probably way more than you. Helping others to be less like me is my penance. Good conversation. Glad we could be civil with each other. Such discussions are far too rare these days.

Nevada just got a whole lot more popular. Come on, state's rights. Let's make this a trend.

Too bad all my coin moves through a hardware wallet that can be deleted in five seconds. 
The great thing about Bitcoin is not only is it technology, it's complex technology. The government can barely handle regular tech. Complex tech baffles them, and the work and effort that would have to go into going after individuals with this info is going to make it not worth it for the likely sentences they'll face. People who are technologically savvy have an immense advantage over the government until they start employing more competent people. Right now it's mostly self-serving d**kwads who want Cadillac health insurance(although I've heard that might be going away, boo hoo).
@_date: 2017-06-03 20:04:05
There isn't misinformation here, though. Do you not believe that the Republicans in earnest want to keep the IRS in check? Especially after the truth came out about the targeting of conservative groups? It's a real thing and if someone on a Bitcoin subreddit, who is probably going to read news more than the average person, wants to vote for them based on this point, who are you to say it's wrong?
