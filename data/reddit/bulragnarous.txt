Who is she and why is she important to BTC? Googling her name came with exec position in a big company.

Why would they buy smaller problematic banks?

If you are not breaking their Terms, you are the owner of whatever is in your wallet. You cannot transfer the crypto... yet - refer to the previous comments for more information. BitPay does all the cryptocurrency work for Neteller and Skrill (Paysafe group) for the moment I suppose they will hold it for you. Where does BitPay get their coins - internal information and it is normal. I assume its theirs.
Could you please elaborate what is fishy and what are your sources?
As per how they safely store the cryptocurrency or the normal funds - no fintech company will disclose such information per security concerns/competition advantage. You can obtain only general information, same goes for the banks.

As previously discussed, if you are right, the compensation will worth the effort and the time.

On the contrary, for the moment they offer the possibility to buy up to 4 cryptocurrencies and you can hold them in your wallets as price may surge OR you buy at 7k and when price is 8k Skrill can buy your coins back. This is daily trading made simple for beginners or people with less knowledge on the matter. The currency is kept there for you and nobody will touch it. Rest assured that the issue with "Not your keys, not your coins" will be adressed, but by then, why not just buy them  at the lower price hold them or sell as a trader? Development requires time, coders are always short - does not matter the project or the company.
Edit: Buying vapour? What about Bitcoin? You never get to touch anything, you only see numbers that are yours, but yet again banks operate the same way, you get to touch cash if your numbers are less than X or Y amount.

As previously discussed, this is the early stage of a bigger project. Quality requires time. If anyone can offer something new - they will. If you have ever created something that required legal approval you would know how hard it is to get it out without hurting someone's interests. Let's wait and see.

Cryptocurrency exchange is a feature in the new beta wallet offered by Skrill. The service is now available for 5 countries, which i do not remember by heart but Italy and Poland were in the list. The cryptocurrency is segregated from the normal wallet currency for easier usage. Fees are displayed when you enter the Exchange section. You cannot use the crypto balance for other uses than trading within that section - this will change. You can buy crypto or convert crypto to fiat, no funds with the Skrill card for the moment.

This exchange feature is in early stage. Have faith, they are not silly and they know it will not bring a solid customer base if it remains in its current form.

This fee is stated as "Repair fee" in their Terms of Use, which you accept upon the account creation. This fee is inserted as penalty for registering false information that needed major correction.

Skrill is GDPR and financial services compliant. This feature is not here to spy on you, but a marketing strategy to attract potential new customers as the fintech industry evolves. To continue on that, this is not a move to stay in business but instead it is an example of adoption.
Just as Mr. Antonopoulos said for the companies that did not embrace the Internet - they did not adapt and went bankrupt.

Disclosure is not always possible as per "security reasons" - if you are a creator of something, you do not wish to give people ideas what got them banned/restricted in the first place and how to bypass it the next time.

You bash Skrill as if other exchanges offer all the positives and Skrill offers all the negatives. It is a service, good example for adoption as they are owned by CVC and Blackstone - take it or leave it. I do not promote them, I simply share experience.

As previously explained, its current use is to "play trader or holder", but this is at the moment. If you want to withdraw funds, simply deposit via Bitcoin in Skrill from they Money In section and withdraw to your bank account (always check with their support if your country is available for this type of transaction)
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:11:52
Haha, just like a little child is never guilty. If you are truly not guilty, seek legal assistance and a lawyer can help you. Should Skrill is mistaken, you will be financially compensated.

I recommend y contact them via email or phone for this confirmation, not via social media as this is not really general information inquiry to be discussed over facebook/tweeter.

Very good to point that out, but the project is not yet fully developed. I assume they will try to enter the wallet game by offering one of their own. The proof for the moment is in your transaction history but you cannot check the addresses... yet. The transactions cannot be erased and are legally protected. They will release more features as soon as possible to be competitive, just as other companies do not rely on what they have built so far.

You are concerned about the security of your documents, but you post a selfie with passport in a forum? You are not bright and in my opinion you are not ready for the crypto tech.
