But even that is kind of useless if you don't pass it on, isn't it?

We've all gotta start somewhere. A little advice, don't share how much Bitcoin you have publically. People might stalk you over it later.

I mean you basically just need to leave them a string of 12 words. You could leave them with a lawyer in a will, you could hide them somewhere and leave instructions on where to find them with a lawyer, you could set up a program with a deadman switch that will email the 12 words to two trusted family members if you don't activate the deadman switch after a time period of your choosing. There are a lot of ways you can go about it.

What I always wonder is, how does this advice jive with the common advice around here "Never ever keep your coins in an exchange!"
Can't have a stop loss in place if your coins are in cold storage...

Thank you so much for the thorough explanation! I really appreciate it.

Because if you're on an insecure system, like an old version of Windows or you've got a virus or something, a hacker could get into your system and steal your keys. For sure don't run anything like TeamViewer on any system that you're storing your wallet on. Realistically you'll probably be fine, but a lot of users on this sub are going to tear me up for suggesting a software wallet, so I'm covering my bases. In my opinion, a hardware wallet doesn't make sense until you have significantly more money in Bitcoin than it would cost you to buy a hardware wallet.

In your own wallet where you are the sole owner of the private keys. Type of wallet doesn't matter as much. You can use a software wallet like electrum (though you've got to be very careful about getting hacked if you do this) or you can use a hardware or paper wallet. Point is, you don't control the private keys, you don't really control the coin.

Sorry, this is going to sound really ignorant, but how do we sell b2x now when we don't possess it? We get b2x after the fork, right? Can you walk me through how to do that? I'd like to get the max value for my b2x.
Edit: And if I sold the futures, and somehow B2X won, and became the new bitcoin, that would mean the usd value I currently have in my BTC would basically be wiped out, correct?
