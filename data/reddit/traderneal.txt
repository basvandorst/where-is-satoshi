You just choose an exchange (preferably one with high volume) and trade according to what your TA says for that exchange. In most cases the TA pattern will also happen on the other exchanges sooner or later anyway (because the price differences are very small) and the few times it doesn't your TA signal should still be good enough to give you an edge.
@_date: 2018-09-25 17:39:59
Well TA should be based on some kind of logic behind it and not just on some kind of magic caused by the signal itself (in my opinion). It's just a tool to easily identify market sentiment and more easily identify turning points. The most important thing to figure out is when to use it cause you cant just blindly pop up a chart, put your favorite TA in it and start trading. 
For example during the hype period last year the herd behaviour of the masses was pretty easy exploitable with TA because this caused clear trends in the crypto's which could be exploited with TA. I traded pretty much everyday on the short term and made consistent profits doing so. Then the turning point came and the crashes started to happen which caused a change in TA strategy to be made but still buying the dips of these crashes could be exploited using TA. After that the masses left and volume and volatily just went to much down for me and i pretty much stopped trading the crypto markets. Now im just waiting for another hype period to happen to start following trends again or a big crash to buy the dip.

Well that last one from yesterday isn't really set yet has it? But I agree that around $7300,- is a very important support zone atm. Just as $9000,- is important resistance. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:37:30
Really depends on where you are setting your stoplosses. If you set your stoplosses at for example $8001,- a 1 dollar spread is probably enough beceause there should be laying a shit ton on $8000,-. But if you are setting you stoploss for example on $7999,- you better set a spread of atleast $30,- if you want to be almost 100% sure your order gets filled (because the momentum/stoplosses triggered when going trough such an important support most of the times will push the price significantly lower in 1 instant without filling any of your sell orders if set to tight).

Saw a little uptick. Knew this comment couldn't be far away. Was not dissapointed. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:42:14
Well first of all let me say that I think it's great that you did some backtesting on a strategy that you think might work and share your methods and results on here. 
Just as a feedback these are the things that I don't like about the backtesting you did and which for me makes the backtesting unreliable:
1. You backtested on a total of 17 data points which for backtesting is far and far to little (should be atleast be in the hundreds and preferable thousands for any reliable results). This alone for me makes the results negligible.
2. The backtesting period you choose to backtest your short strategy is during a clearly overall downward period of the market which would make almost any short strategy come out on top. You should test the strategy during multiple market conditions not just the one that favors your strategy the most (hindsight bias). And also choosing the weekends because you know that bitcoin has dropped the most in the weekends during your backtesting period is clearly creating hindsight bias. And indeed I don't think it's a good idea to see the backtesting period (the screenshots) in full before doing the backtest because ofcourse this could influence your results if you (knowingly of unknowingly) take this data into account.
3. You don't really clearly specify your entry and exit rules. You say your entry point is 'after Bitcoin rises somewhat on saturday and then when you think you found the peak you go short' and then 'when it rises to much you kill the trade'. These really arn't clearly defined entry and exit rules and should be specified much clearer to prevent subjectivity influencing the results to much. For example 'On saturday after the price of bitcoin has risen more then 5% I will go short after it then falls for more then 2% from the top. Then I will exit my short position after it has dropped for more then 5% en then rises more then 2% from the bottem'. 
4. You state that the strategy would have worked during the backtesting period because you only got 2 losers and 11 winners. These results alone do not prove that the strategy would have been profitable during that period. You should be looking at how much (in percentages or dollar amount) your winning and losing trades make and then check if your winners outweight the losers and by how much (you can have losing strategy's that have far more winners then losers in it because the risk/reward is not good enough). 
These are just some points that I myself would work on for futher backtesting but in no case am I some backtesting legend myself.

On Bitfinex hundreds and hundreds of bitcoin are traded every 15 minutes. That some random guy sells some on Bittrex doens't mean anything.
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:48:25
It's not about predicting the market but more about recognizing good trading setups with a positive edge so that in the long term you win more then you lose (thus making a profit). And a lot of traders are doing this and are living of the returns.
@_date: 2018-03-25 18:55:24
I understand it was 100% of the existing data of the period that you believe was clearly different then the period before that (and I don't say it wasn't). But just because that's all the data you can get doesn't make the results reliable. It just means atm it's not possible to really backtest this kind of strategy with reliable results (not enough data points, overall downward market which positively influences all short strategy's). 
And maybe the second point that I made wasnt enterly correct cause I understand what you are saying. But hindsight bias happens when instead of first formulating an hypothesis like 'I believe bitcoin tends to fall in the weekend because (fill in some reason/I myself really can't think of one)' and then start backtesting this hypothesis. You start with observing something (hey I notice that bitcoin falls more in the weekends) and then just backtest the thing that you just observed (over the same period that you have just observed it in). 
For example: I could just backtest all the days of the weeks seperatly for the last 12 weeks and identify per each day if the bitcoin price on average has risen more or dropped more. Then I could say well Bitcoin seems to go down on average on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday but goes up on average on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday but would you then really think that this says anything about how Bitcoin will perform in the futher on any of these days (beceause for me it certainly wouldnt). At I minimum I would then have to get data from a different data set and see if these findings still hold (which probably they wouldn't). 
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:13:53
You mean the steady downwards trend without any upwards momentum? Yeay really bullish sign for a $1000,- pump.
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:06:39
The fact that the price still dropped in the end is because on all the exchanges thousands and thousands of bitcoins were sold not just that 1 guy on Bittrex. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 14:23:59
Data snooping bias - Was the strategy preplanned before backtesting? Does it have a reasonable explanation, and is not just a random finding after the fact?
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:33:15
To the moon? I'm sold! Where can I sign up?
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:16:37
The prices are going up by a small amount and you are long in the market. So compared to yesterday you made a thousand dollars.
@_date: 2018-03-29 06:04:26
You shouldn't (in my opinion) base your investment/trading decisions on your P&amp;L.
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:33:38
And the day before that....
@_date: 2018-03-25 18:23:19
Ok, in the end we kinda agree then. So besides the guy on Bittrex other traders on other exchanges were (massively) selling bitcoins as well which made the price drop. If the guy on Bittrex created some kind of momentum by aggresivly selling his bitcoins which created a snowball effect on the other exchanges I can not say but in theory ofcourse could be possible. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 21:12:41
Maybe because 8.5k isn't some magic barrier and btc can go much lower then that? Not saying that's its going to crash or something but just because we once jumped from that price doesnt mean its never going lower then that. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:18:29
Maybe 1 Million in the next 5 min?
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:03:28
Very wise, now your thinking like the "smart" money does. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:56:28
You keep being hilarious. Bravo.
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:03:52
Exactly arbitrage does the rest. So if only 1 seller is stupid enough to sell hundreds and hundreds of bitcoins on Bittrex in 1 go the price just rebounds very quickly because the price hasnt dropped on the other exchanges that have far more volume and people would just buy on Bittrex and immediatly sell on the other exhanges. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:20:31
Arbitrage is basically buying a security in one market and simultaneously selling it in another market at a higher price, profiting from the temporary difference in prices. This is considered riskless profit for the investor/trader.
From Investopedia
So in this case due to someone buying 300 coins in 1 go on Bitfinex the price on Bitfinex was temporally higher compared to the price on the other exchanges. So big parties which can trade without transaction costs (so called market makers) can make a (almost) riskless profit by selling on Bitfinex and simultaneously buying on one of the other exchanges.
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:45:35
I have exactly the same feeling. Although I also feel like everyone is expecting it which makes it from actually happening less likely in my experience. For now im just following it from the sidelines and will not buy before a significant drop or until we go above 7500.
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:04:34
Why is it 'to early' and why is this 'to fast'. Have you ever ever looked at the movements of cryptocurrencies before? A 33% rise in 13 days is everything but 'to fast' especially after the bottoming out of the market after a 70% decline from the top. Your just spewing bullshit. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 11:59:59
I really don't think the spikes are a bad/manipulating thing myself. It's just that big players are trading the markets at the moment with different viewpoints on where the prices of the crypto's are going to go. Every time an previous resistance is broken there's just an over demand because the one that believe the prices will go up are then buying aggressively because they think this really is a good opportunity to buy while it's still possible while at the same time the shorters are closing their positions because they can't handle the losses anymore or are changing their viewpoint on basis of the recent price development. Just my point of view. Expecting a change in sentiment to go slow and gradually is just not how these markets work.
@_date: 2018-04-08 12:30:02
Pretty sure it was just a market maker. Someone bought 300 coins which caused an arbitrage opportunity. As soon as the prices from the other exchanges got to that price he cancelled the order. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 10:41:27
Well that happened sooner then expected. Now well see. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:58:42
It doesn't matter how long it takes for the coins to get to the other exchange. They just have coins on both exchanges and sell on the one with the higher price and buy on the one with the lower price. Then they send the bought coins to the other exchange.
And for the risk of holding the coins they can just short by the same amount on 1 of the exchanges. (or when an arbitrage opportunity arrives go short on the exchange with the higher price and long on the exchange with the lower price). 
@_date: 2018-04-20 10:36:39
Are you guys ready for a big pump? Personally expect that when 8500 is broken near 10.000 will be reached in a few hours/days and I’m normally really not the one making these big price predictions but this resistance area is just to important to be ignored by the big players.
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:10:13
Lol, since we broke the 8500-9000 area it's impossible to draw a downward sloping line from the top of 20k on 17 December even on the logarithmic scale (on the linear scale it was not possible since we broke the 8k barrier). So people must be really desperate to still claim to be in a bear market from a TA perspective. Only thing they can hold on to is that we haven’t broke the 12k barrier yet.
