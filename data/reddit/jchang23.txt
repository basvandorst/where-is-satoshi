best time to invest in bitcoin is when you have money you can afford to lose and want to make a reasonable gamble 
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:27:08
Nice saying, and sounds great. Reality is, trying to catch things while they are going up creates poor people, catching drops "falling knives" is what creates wealth. Obviously if you don't think BTC has a future, then sure, it's never a good time to buy.

Hey, there are different trading styles out there. If everyone traded the same way there would be no volatility, no sellers, therefore no buyers and you would have a zero sum asset.
Funds spend billions of dollars a year just on data. In fact, Goldman Sachs alone spent about 400 million on data last year. Why? Because if you have data and see patterns and signals you could make money. 
Bitcoin is no longer something that some private people trade from their home. As big money moves in, it will start to behave like any major asset class, AND all liquid volatile asset classes have the potential to form patterns that are actionable. 
I have nothing against your trading style, I would compare it to how Buffett and some long term smart money investors buy stocks. However, others might have different ways they trade and make money off things.
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:12:15
A correlation does not always translate in an exact dollar value. Gold was always the safe place investors piled their money in during times of uncertainty (even short periods) it was never an exact science, it was just known that gold spikes when the market declines, there was no point for point.
I suspect maybe you are thinking about an inverse ETF style hedge, I am not talking about that.
In the coming months if we see this continue, the correlation will only get stronger. 
A lot more data is needed for there to be actionable probabilities for traders.

why buy an alt coin? If you have 500k create your own alt coin, it will carry the same value as the one you will buy and based on what I am seeing there are enough sheep out there that your alt coin will be worth 5 million on day one even if you do real bad.

Sometimes greed is relative to the outcome. 
If I buy BTC at 7500 because it dipped and then it ends up crashing and burning, I would be called greedy.
If it ends up going up way higher, people would tell me I should have purchased more. They certainly would not call me greedy.
I have been in this game long enough to know that I don't know. I believe that long term BTC will grow, but predicting short term trends is foolish.

@_date: 2018-05-24 11:59:19


If BTC goes to 15k then "NOW" is early. If BTC goes to 5k then "NOW" is late. 
BTC is limited to 21 million coins. On a overall scale, its acceptance now is pretty much zero compared to its potential. 
At some point you will have more people accepting it than those that stop to accept it. This will cause very powerful rises in the price of a coin with the risk of a decline being limited.
In fact, that might cause businesses to offer discounts for those paying with BTC (as some already do) and the consumer might not want to spend their coins that often, causing more of a rise in its price. 
I buy BTC for long term, my time horizon is years not months. Because of that I don't own that much because the money I can afford to risk and be out of for years is not that much.

Total number of millionaires that own a Lambo 11,999,999
Minus 11,999,999 that already have a Lambo = 21,000,001 that don't. 
This means that 21,000,001 will want a bitcoin. 
It will be that 1 single BTC over the 21 million that they will fight over that will take us to the moon.

My point was how easy it is for people to make chargebacks without first needing to call the company and getting info.
It is not uncommon for small businesses that really dont have much money in their account, to get overdrawn because one customer made a chargeback. 
Chargebacks should not be allowed unless the customer tries to call the company, visits the site, and gives time for a company to respond.
There are some credit cards that will call the company with the user on the phone, we got those calls all the time.

Brings me back memories of my very first job. I was an intern and worked in the billing department for a company that sold refurbished electronics online. 
From 9-5 I would call people that charged back. These are people that ordered a product from us, got the product, yet for some off reason told their credit card company they did not recognize the charge.
We made sure that their credit card statement has a descriptor that showed our website name and next to it our phone number.
I would call these people, remind them that they placed the order and we see it was delivered, and in most cases they would say "oh, I didn't realize that the company that sold me the TV was called...."
I remember my manager would get so upset when a chargeback came in that was over 1000 bucks.
With bitcoin you dont have to worry about this. 
Some people abuse the chargeback process in significant ways.

I suspect that during the high in December many used their credit cards to buy coins. They figured it will go up and up so who cares.

@_date: 2018-03-18 13:43:50
The past year has been a very humbling experience for me with bitcoin. I learned that unlike with stocks that you have a chance to predict its move based on a whole host of things, with bitcoin, I cannot predict anything at all in the short term.
So why am I holding on to it? Because long term I do think that it will be just as a common as a way to pay like credit cards are today, and with a finite amount, it would have to keep increasing in price. 
In the past 6 months alone, the innovation has been incredible, and there is the compounding effect going on because so many are getting involved in this space every day. 
In 10 years from now, its either bitcoin is gone or its worth a lot more than it is today. Do you think it will vanish? Do you think if it survives another 10 years the price will be where it is today? 
Not everyone is pro bitcoin, however, some very smart people who have a good track record at predicting tech trends, fully support it.

"Hodl on" that was added without a doubt to get to the mentally weak. Nothing wrong with saying those words, but you added it to help your con.

@_date: 2018-02-04 19:22:05
Let's not ignore the reality. Once upon a time people saw BTC as an anonymous way to send or receive funds. That is a basic fact or else so many criminals who have been apprehended would not have used it.
Now everyone knows that it's easy to trace and exchanges at least in the US, Most of EU and in Asia have to get all types of ID or they will get shut down.
The first main use of BTC online by end consumer was for illegal items or to pay extortion money mostly to those that encrypted their system.
BTC now is trying to be made more mainstream. The consumer and businesses will need a real benifit if they will use it. 
For now the major cause of BTC rise or fall is by speculators. Some you can explain by news items some are just traders being traders.
As it stands now I cannot see why a end user that has a credit card would use BTC at a merchant that offers CC payments.
Things can change.

Wait, isn't this the same like a bucket shop? 
"As defined by the U.S. Supreme Court, a bucket shop is "an establishment, nominally for the transaction of a stock exchange business, or business of similar character, but really for the registration of bets, or wagers, usually for small amounts, on the rise or fall of the prices of stocks, grain, oil, etc., there being no transfer or delivery of the stock or commodities nominally dealt in.
A person who engages in the practice is referred to as a bucketeer and the practice is sometimes referred to as bucketeering."

"So as long as they're actually buying / selling based on your purchases it is not a bucketshop."

Respect the law of probability, it will help you make money.
" Obviously anyone who thinks Bitcoin is going to collapse shouldn't be investing in it at all"
Nonsense, money can be made even in things you know are nonsense.

Throw in a beanie baby too, why not. Copy and paste the following into your post:
Edit 3; We also got her some beanie babies just in case the price goes up. We did everything everyone suggests we do in the comments. We even printed out a copy of this thread so she can see it when she is 18 just in case this sub is so exclusive by then that only those with 15 lambos and 500 btc can gain access to it.
These falling bitcoin prices cause people to take more meds than usual and they show up here with nonsense stories.

Wake me up when a company makes it easy for people to buy bitcoins without having to send over their DNA, a Limb and a copy of their electric bill dating back to when they were born. 
Let's mature a bit and stop crying like babies when the fact is pointed out that for the average user (not you) getting bitcoins and keeping them safe is far from easy.
I must add "this is great for bitcoin" or else some of you will have a heart attack

Fairytales 2.0
Who ever thought that a byproduct of bitcoin will be an endless stream or fantasy stories. 
Ideas on how you can keep this BS story going:
If Bitcoin drops to 5k tomorrow, you can post:
"I loved the cruise so much that I am going again and I got out of that 7k coin at $6995 right before I boarded the ship".
If Bitcoin goes to 10k tomorrow
"I was so excited that my order was filled at 7k that as soon as I got home I got another 50 bitcoins at $6800".
I figured you must be so tired from that cruise and you have so much catching up to do, that I would help with the next chapters in the story book. 
Hopefully someone appreciates my work and they hire and pay me in bitcoin.
I just got an offer to write fairy tales, the guy wants to pay me in bitcoin but using the conversion of 4 years ago! Just checked my account, he sent me 1500 bitcoins! 
Please send me a link to that cruise, I can finally afford it and will even drive to the ship in my lambo.

Lawyer: Your honor, my clients honestly thought that this is how you mine for bitcoin, a perfectly legal activity. 
Judge: I accept that explanation, I was confused myself as to what bitcoin mining is.

In the past two months its all been BTC pay except when the client insisted to use something else or if the client is not technical at all. In the past he mostly did integration with coinbase not bitpay.

My guess is that if these billionaires are telling us now they are getting in it means they are already in and possibly lost a lot and now are using this to get others going so they can get out. 
They are rich for a reason, they don't think and behave like the rest of us. 
IF they really are just getting in now you will see BTC rise significantly within weeks. However, I think the past rise was because they got in and some did not get out on time. 
They are lining up the sheep, something the rich investment bankers are masters at. 
We will see what happens, my personal opinion is that they are looking to get out, not in. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 05:26:44
In my opinion he is already in and is down big, this was an attempt to get the price moving higher so he can get out.

Same reason they banned telegram, nothing to do with crypto and all to do with controlling the mostly youth that are tired of that regime. Too bad they did not succeed in their last uprising.

Nobody stopped to consider the population numbers? 
For example, the Automobile was invented in 1885, world population was right about 1 billion. 
50 million people today amounts to about 1% of the global population, this means that if 0.2% adopt bitcoin a year for 5 years you have your 50 million, not much of a big deal.
