Everytime btc goes down, someone pops out and tell their i quit story.
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:52:14
I just hope that you made the right decision.
@_date: 2018-06-30 11:31:31
Its not fomo, its market manipulation.
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:23:22
Smart guy
@_date: 2018-06-29 20:56:56
I hope that it wont crash like bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-30 11:28:27
Smart move, i did the same.
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:10:46
I agree
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:59:33
Aha, i say bs.
@_date: 2018-07-02 15:02:32
Funny /s

He outsmarted himself when he sold himself to bitmain.
@_date: 2018-04-26 18:28:20
Draw a line and tell yourself it can go up or down. ��
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:18:59
It will go down again, its too fast. FOMO kicked in.
@_date: 2019-09-25 02:58:21
I laughed.
@_date: 2018-04-26 18:58:59
I would say dipping sour cream pattern
Sell: NOW
Buy: 6700
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:39:26
Not gonna happen
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:38:52
It was super obvious that it will drop to 8800
@_date: 2018-04-26 09:58:07
Rising to the bottom right?
@_date: 2018-04-26 11:36:35
We are heading back to 6700, same pattern.

@_date: 2018-04-26 11:46:33
Noobs lost faith in btc, so now its fight only between vets.

Panic sellers
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:49:05
Just dont lie to yourself. Its pump and dump. 8700 and less. Bitcoin is just a big gamble, nothing else.
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:39:06
Aaaand i was right
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:05:59
Almost 500k and its not enough for you? Thats just silly.
@_date: 2018-04-26 12:05:40
Im realist, nothing more. Its same with gpu mining shitcoins. All noobs got scared and ran away.
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:01:28
I told you, back to 8800 ��
@_date: 2018-04-27 06:18:12
But not smarter than asians and europeans.
@_date: 2018-04-27 05:50:51
Asians are smart, followed by europe. Americans are those, who can be easily manipulated by fomo. And Roger ver
@_date: 2018-12-05 08:59:44
No
