Does not, no. My question remains though - traded by whom? I'm really curious whether it's funds (traditional, crypto, algo, etc), or solo-traders (crypto-millionaires, traditional, day-traders, etc). Any numbers / research would be really interesting to look at (if they exist - probs not).

This. I buy the theoretical argument that people could buy and sell the same coin, thus creating volume not profit. But who'd bother? Waste of time + money (fees). There is someone taking the other end of the trade. Who is that someone (especially the buyer)?

Just to clarify - what is a huge risk? That Bitfinex controls tether and that a lot of people are trading against it?
Side question - you think most of USDT is used for shorting / hedging?

Really interesting observation - you are right top markets are BTC/USDT - [
What does this mean? I'm trying to think - people are backing up into Tether (risk off) and back (risk on)?

Pretty convincing math. 1k \* 1kk = 1kkk, so 33% of probably washed volume. I can buy that there are 1k traders around the globe who are sitting on a mil each.

Sort of. I'm asking who are the people that buy $300bn of bitcoin every day, and who are the people that sell $300 of bitcoin every day. Like are they funds (what kind?), individual traders (what kind?), etc. I'm just trying to understand who's in the ecosystem today.
