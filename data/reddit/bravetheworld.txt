Slight....wow. I honestly don't get why ppl who know nothing about bitcoin are in this thread
@_date: 2014-08-05 16:13:52
that's exactly what I've been saying. And when I'm on next week I'll be using the online gold analogy for bitcoin so his listeners can digest. this is a VERY good step for bitcoin exposure. I'm excited.

"We must declare our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the Planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts.
We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace."

amir is one of the only people I know who actually does what he preaches, lives his philosophy, and is honest throughout. He doesn't pander or censor himself. That's what ppl REALLY have issue with. Period. Need more like him. Refreshing really.

Since there are so many troglodytes here, I thought I'd point out some facts that should be obvious. 
1. Companies adjust smartphone prices depending on the country and standard of living. This means that my cousins in buttfuck village Russia that can't afford to move out or eat well still have a better phone plan than me, in Canada. 
2. Obviously remote areas of Africa will not have smartphones. Yet. But they will have smartphones way before they have an exploitative banking infrastructure. That was the entire point. And people in Zimbabwe were using digital phone currency before the innovation of bitcoin. Big picture people. 
3. There are projects underway now to help distribute bitcoin tech to desolate parts of Africa so they can send remittance  for basically free. That's huge. 
4. Bitcoin is not for privileged  white ppl. I just stayed with the dark wallet team in Barcelona. They have 0 money to their name. All they have is their laptops. Their community also actively educates underprivileged youths in this tech. So anyone who preaches white privilege is simply living in a bubble of their own positive circumstances, blind to the actions of others around the world.
