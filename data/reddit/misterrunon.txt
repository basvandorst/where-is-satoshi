the federal reserve acts in both the interests of the wealthy bankers AND government. maybe there are some shades of grey, but that is its de facto function.
bitcoin is also traded worldwide, so its success does not fully hinge on U.S. law and regulation.

why would they do a fake auction then? they'd just keep the wallet in the hands of the FBI.
@_date: 2014-09-26 21:27:34
let's not play with apples and oranges.
how plausible do you think it would be that government would or could ban the use of bitcoins (if it were to threaten government's livelihood)? banning it would mean all the big name merchants wouldn't accept the coins, and there'd be panic selling. that would, in turn, relegate bitcoin to a radical/fringe cryptocurrency in addition to crashing the price.
this is already happening in russia and china. i don't think it's a coincidence that last year's bull-run died down (in part) due to china tightening its regulations on bitcoin.

i'm most likely going to get downvoted for saying this in but he does have a valid point. no government is going to let go of its grip on printed money. if or once bitcoin gets so big that it impinges on government's ability to regulate cash, then you will see not so positive regulation on bitcoin.

this might become a long winded debate. i don't think paper money will disappear if billions of people start using it. and to believe that it will just happen because a popular proponent of bitcoin is saying so.. might fall into the bitcoin evangelism territory. 
i really hate the internet and bitcoin comparison. they do share a similarity in the ability to revolutionize the world, but they are not the same thing. when you need to purchase/exchange assets or goods, you have an alternative to bitcoin - paper money, gold, whatever. when the internet was created, there was no other alternative to it. those two factors have a role on the level of adoption. i don't see how billions of people will adopt bitcoin, especially with luddites/technophobes (like our parents) who can't even fathom wtf it is.
to say that money will be eradicated.. i find that crazy. someone's going to end up losing a lot of money.

apple does not listen to their customers.. and they don't really give people what they want. if that were the case, they wouldn't hold back widely available features (from other brands) for a year.. and when the next cycle comes, they announce this "new" groundbreaking feature.
steve jobs never listened to what people wanted; he only listened to what he thought he wanted, which in his mind was an extension of what people really wanted. he never liked consumer panels/testing, he thought increasing the iphone's screen size from 3.5 was ridiculous, and a 7" tablet would never work..

i think people who are talking about bitcoin replacing USD are the ones who give it a bad name. it will never replace paper currency for plenty of reasons. 1) governments like to manipulate cashflow.. do you think they'd give all their power away without a fight? 2) bitcoin is deflationary, which discourages spending. 3)in order for a currency to work, there needs to be price stability. 4) if it were used as a world currency, the blockchain would balloon to a point where it'd be very difficult to support.

no, it's not possible and even if it were, we're nowhere close. 
i've been over this with bitcoin evanglists ad nauseam. 
- the minute that bitcoin threatens a government's ability to control money, it will be outlawed. power likes power, and bitcoin can definitely threaten government authority.
- the size of the blockchain would become unmanageable if most of the world began using it. you can't just say that we'll somehow magically fix the problem and count that as evidence.
- bitcoin does not appeal to the lowest common denominator. there's a high risk of losing/misplacing them due to its non-reversible feature. it's also a lot of work - do you really think old or technologically slow people would be open to it?
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:23:46

i'm not saying bitcoin won't be big. the original point was that bitcoin will never overtake the dollar, and i still contend that it still stands.

yeah i am noticing a lot of bugs myself.. i learned how to use it 2-3 days ago and it was really confusing.
my two issues are: 
- you can export the private key on a watching-only wallet. of course, it's not a real private key since a watching-only wallet doesn't have your seed.. but i was confused at first.
- i have a transaction that shows as unverified, even though i have the funds in my wallet already.

i don't know if SR is actually a good thing. it seems like so much seedy stuff happens there. that's not to say that it's only a midwife for bad things to occur, but some people tend to disregard all that blackmailing/hire for murder stuff going on.
@_date: 2013-11-06 02:02:33
yeah i just did that.. am i not allowed to have two wallets at once? i'm looking at my old wallet right now, and i don't see an option to add an additional public key. i know i could just save my wallet.dat file and then recreate a new one, but there's no other way of running two wallets simultaneously?
@_date: 2013-09-02 03:29:27

@_date: 2013-11-17 11:53:40
There is no way to not be worried about that.  A lot of people wear btc colored glasses and refuse to admit that btc is no guruantee.
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:29:51
well, it does use a server's blockchain.. as opposed to armory which uses the local bitcoin qt blockchain.
btw, i can use my offline device to sign transactions as well right? but if it's not online, wouldn't my wallet not update itself? the private key would be used just for signing the transactions, wouldn't it?
is this the way it works?
- create wallet on offline computer.
- export the public key, and import to online computer to check balances etc. the online computer only has the public key to check balances, without the seed (which is used to identify the private key).
- the private key does not get exported (unless you want another backup), and the seed should be kept secret.
i think i'm starting to get a clearer picture of how this all works.
@_date: 2013-11-06 02:17:41
thanks.. i thought i had it all figured out, but after importing my public key, i'm for some reason able to export the the private key. i'm gonna have to backtrack and see what went wrong.
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:47:01
this would make sense, especially for people who meet in-person. meet up at starbucks, buy some BTC and a cup of coffee.
@_date: 2013-10-13 01:43:48
makes sense to me. before SR went down, people did not know how well bitcoins would fare without SR. now that we know that bitcoins are not so dependent on SR, the value should be higher.

@_date: 2013-11-06 02:55:25
alright, i'm stuck here. there's something i don't understand.
i exported the master public key from the offline computer, deleted the old wallet to start a new watching only wallet. i then tried to export my private key, which actually worked.. i thought using the public key meant that the watching only wallet does not have access to the private key?
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:32:35
this is strange... when i enter the public key, it says "error: no seed." i get what you're saying, and it should be safe, but i need to do it myself before feeling comfortable. i'm gonna try importing it into another wallet and will get back to you.
edit: yeah, the new key is inconsequential, i compared it to the original. strange how they did that.
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:15:17
yeah, there are people speculating that it'll reach $500 by year's end, and then 10,000 by the end of next year.. based on what, i don't even know.

@_date: 2013-11-06 04:33:52
think i'm set now. i'll just back up the .dat and the seed. if i back up the private key, and if someone gets ahold of the public one, they could use my coins without having to bypass a PW (.dat is encrypted with a PWB).. but then again, they could do the same with the seed.. but i memorized a few of the seed and will omit them in my backup. 
that makes sense, right? 
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:08:39
alright, so one last thing... thanks for answering all these questions btw.
backing up the wallet: the seed is used to identify the private key. should i also keep a copy of the private key though? in addition to the wallet.dat?
i'm not sure how to recover the wallet by importing the private key.
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:45:53
that would be a problem if bitcoin didn't trend upward, as it obviously is. being volatile is part of the high risk/high reward status.
once bitcoin is stable, what do you think will happen? it won't skyrocket like it has been.. at  which point, would you say "the problem with bitcoin is that it doesn't skyrocket anymore."
@_date: 2013-11-07 13:11:52
depends on how big it gets.. but still, it would be a redistribution of wealth.. and even though we techy/nerdy bitcoiners salivate at the sight of bitcoins going up and up... i trust nerdy/tech guys much more than politicians, businessmen, lobbyists, lawyers, and other assholes.

i still don't know how government will allow companies to use bitcoins, especially since it can't be traced. even if target voluntarily paid taxes, couldn't it just make up a number on their income, and then withhold a certainn portion of the bitcoins they receive (since it's untraceable)? 
wouldn't it be easier for a small business to use bitcoins to evade taxes?
@_date: 2013-11-12 07:16:16
Well, that's the problem. Recommending it at $5 could mean that he had a large pile of coin and wanted you to buy in. He could have a vested interest, and it would be you buying bitcoin.

Makes absolutely no sense. If i had btc, i would pay her $300 for an hour vs. $1100 in btc. If she thought btc were too risky, she could cash out asap. 
it's like saying "if you have euros, I will take 600 per hour.. or if you have USD, i'll take $300 per hour." all i'd need to do is trade my euros for USD, and then see her for half the price.

@_date: 2013-11-08 21:43:09
yeah it's okay.. on your watch-only wallet, the seed or private key are not imported so there's no way of getting the private key out of that machine.

it does have its purposes though.. for illegal activities. and not every druggie or gun buyer has caught on to it yet too.

all i'm saying is that the safest way to protect your asset is by cold storage. a lot of people did not have the foresight to spend time to protect their assets, or actually spend the time to invest in their coin. now they really regret not doing what was considered the smart thing.

can i ask you this? what happens if im using armory and my blockchain client is wiped out.. i'd still be okay as long as i have backup copies of my wallet.dat, right? i'm currently in the process of figuring out which to use: electrum or armory. i like that armory has more features and your encryption can be done offline, but i'd hate to lose anything because of hardware failure.

@_date: 2013-11-06 01:22:48
thanks for the info. so as long as anyone gets ahold of my private key, they have access to my coins then.. that's kind of unnerving. the encryption/pw is for preventing other people from exporting your key then, since there's no way to apply an encryption to the private key.
if there is no seed for your key, it means you can't send funds.. which means there's no way of creating a wallet without a seed right?
@_date: 2013-05-24 23:29:31
another potential issue is.. who is going to manage the bitcoins? what prevents someone from transferring the company's funds into their own wallet? 
fyi, these are just honest questions.. i'm not trying to imply that i know what's going to happen. bitcoins are totally new territory. i just think there are a lot of potential issues concerning anonymity.

i think i'm going to end up using armory since i plan on using a cold wallet. i don't have many and don't plan on cashing out or spending those coins any time soon. it's kind of like my lottery ticket.. one that will give me a minor vested interest in BTC's development.

been using credit unions and they have been awesome. i still use chase for my credit cards though. i think i should get a credit union CC for all non-cashback related purchases. when i do use cashback rewards, at least chase doesn't make that much money.
i believe in the bitcoin movement and i will be proactive in saying "fuck you" to the big dogs who manipulate the game in their favor.

I take issue with your certainty of certainty. Thats not to say that im all against bitcoin, but you make it seem as a sure thing. Nothing is a sure thng. Thats all we are saying.
