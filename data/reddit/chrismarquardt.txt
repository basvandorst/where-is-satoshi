Greenaddress.it uses multi-signature addresses (aka P2SH) that start with a 3 instead of a 1.
All bitcoin addresses have a built-in checksum, so typos will be caught.

Help me out please, I keep getting a BAD signature on Bitcoin 0.9.1 - might be a noob issue though.
Step 1: I download 
    bitcoin-0.9.1-macosx-setup.dmg and SHA256SUMS.asc
Step 2: I run
    gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc bitcoin-0.9.1-macosx-setup.dmg 
It returns:
    gpg: not a detached signature
Step 3: I edit SHA256SUMS.asc to remove the first 8 lines (so only the signature part is left in the file) and verify again
It returns:
    gpg: Signature made Tue Apr  8 20:34:21 2014 CEST using RSA key ID 1FC730C1
    gpg: BAD signature from "Gavin Andresen (CODE SIGNING KEY) &lt;gavinandresen

No hate here, just healthy skepticism. Had a bitcoin stealing tool on my desktop once because I jumped on a "cool new tool" and got almost bitten. Please don't blame me for being cautious, my question was serious: what should make me trust them?

breadwallet seems to strive for the simplest interface, which I fully support. Take the geeky hurdles out so the app doesn't appear threatening to newbies. I love the well thought-out features like "tap the address to allow copy/email/sms" (even though I would've called sms "Message" to be more in line with what Apple calls this, see "transfer of learned behavior" below). Kudos for that.
But this is where this thinking about simplicity seems to come to a halt.
(Note: I like breadwallet, I like how it's open source and I really want it to succeed. Please see the following points in that light)
Most of my points are about "transfer of learned behavior" - I understand that breadwallet tries to break some of that (for example by forcing users to use bits), but I believe in a gentler approach, and re-inventing the wheel by re-inventing proven user interaction paradigms doesn't seem to be helpful.
I consider the "bits only" decision confusing and likely a turn-off for newbies.  Design idea: at the top, have three fields: bits, btc &amp; a fiat currency of the users' choice - tap either of them to enter a value, the other two fields update automatically. This would serve to get people used to bits without forcing them into it.
Instead of tabs, breadwallet uses swipe to switch between the sending and receiving contexts. This goes against what people have learned from other apps, so there is zero transfer of learned behavior. Potential put-off for newbies. Design idea: make "send" and "receive" their own tabs. This would also allow you for easier future extensibility.
breadwallet uses a "Menu" icon (parallel horizontal lines) in the left top that in other apps usually lead to a swipe-in menu. Here it leads to a new view that is not a menu. Instead it's a mix of "transaction history" and "a few menu items that didn't fit anywhere else". No transfer of learned behavior. Design idea: make a proper slide-in menu, give transactions their own view, put the additional menu items onto their own "settings" or "other actions" page.

Thanks. Any ETA for that? I love testing new wallets on iOS, it's great to see so many new apps come online.

@_date: 2014-06-16 09:47:26
Yes, it's a real wallet, it holds your private key on the phone and lets you export it and back it up. Only gives you one address, but works great for smaller stuff. It can even swipe private keys, but that is very slow for now. Let's hope they update that.

And it's not limited to older folks either.

I'm aware of that. It's especially visible in the speed when sweeping keys - very slow because UIWebview's JavaScript is much slower. Generally I'd still consider it native though. You get it through the App Store and all of Apple's restrictions that come with that apply.

Okay, quick rant (at nobody in particular, but it feels like this is the right place for it because I just spent 20 minutes trying to find out where I messed up).
I consider myself a fairly technical person, I've been using and administering at least 5 different Un\*x derivates, I speak *vi* fluently, when I'm on a computer, I probably spend half the time in a terminal, but even *I* find this all confusing at times.
We've still got such a long long way to go until someone like my mom\* will be able to *know* how she can trust a computer, let alone verify someone's digital signature with confidence when it comes to her (digital) money.
Unless someone comes up with a fool-proof and tamper-proof way to make crypto accessible to the masses (Trezor? Still too techy?) I doubt it will happen in her lifetime. Don't get me wrong, I'm very bullish on Bitcoin, I'm in it for the long haul, but there are so many areas that need work that sometimes I get just a little frustrated..

You'd think the initial onboarding or account cloning procedure would have received a bit more thorough testing.
I'm a fan of Greenaddress, have played with their html5 wallet for a while. Multisig solves quite a few security problems and I was hoping these guys would have a good start with their native implementation.
The way it looks now, they have botched some of that. On the other hand they finally have the visibility and the public scrutiny that they need to take software quality a bit more serious.
Best of luck guys, you still have the potential to bring a good multisig implementation to iOS.

The dev says it is beta and at this point I'd say he's right.
Great concept, but it shows me a BTC amount in the wallet that is off by a factor of 10.
It should show: 0.002 BTC

The latest version of Bither offers me several private key import options:
Import Private Key 
- from private key text (result: "Not match private key format")
- from HDM cold phrase (no format match)
- from HD account phrase (no format match)
I can also import a BIP38-encrypted private key. Also no format match.
So whatever that string is, it doesn't seem to be in a format Bither recognizes. I have also posted an issue on their Github.

Either they are blind, or they are incapable to see that the blockchain technology is nothing without the currency. The currency creates the incentive to mine and thus to keep the blockchain healthy.

I'm very excited about this, even though it's a little scary. Especially as I have no idea how to explain Bitcoin to my tax guy. He is almost 70, hates computers and he happens to be my uncle. Oh well, got to start somewhere, so get your photos in.

A large part of the success of Bitcoin will be determined by how it's perceived.
When I read your story, I was first surprised of his perception that it's a company, but trying to look at it with a fresh view, it kinda makes sense. After all, there's a logo that looks very official and if I hadn't heard anything about it, I'd probably think the same.
Is there any information out there about what the muggles think Bitcoin is?
