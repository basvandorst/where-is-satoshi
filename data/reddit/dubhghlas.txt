This is correct. It's akin to moving money around different bank accounts. The ledger notes the changes, but cash is never *(usually)* actually exchanged.

Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash share the same algorithms for key creation. If you have a private key for one, it'll work for the other.

The difficulty is set at what Bitcoin's was prior to the fork, but with a fraction of the mining hash rate.

I buy Steam games exclusively with Bitcoin. I just replenish my BTC after each purchase. I also pay my seedbox/VPN provider though BTC.

It is so obvious yet I've never thought of this before. For friends and family, I shall begin preaching the word and putting my BitCoin where my mouth is.
In addition, I've decided to start working on a very simple website explaining why BitCoin is the way to go and tips on how to begin safely. Then, I plan to get some stickers printed up that simply says "Buy BitCoin" with the site's URL. Plaster it all over downtown Portland and hope to convert some people!
