Anyone else find these kind of posts a bit pretentious?
It's one thing to have a question. This community is very generous with answers and asking questions is a responsible way to pursue knowledge. A good question can even add value to a community.
But it's another thing to assume your question is some sort of elephant in the room, yet every day we have multiple people conflating their showerthoughts with some sort of novel, systemic, Achilles heel doomsday scenario.

There's a lot of machinery you have to implement/support to integrate with plastic cards. For instance, the card needs to be backed by a money transmitter buffer that can handle things like net terms and chargeback and ACH rejection and the wire interchange.
At which point you might as well convert BTC into a fiat currency that the plastic card systems already work with. 
Using BTC directly at POS is novel. I don't *need* all those moving parts to buy a coffee, I simply use my cards because they're more convenient to carry than cash. BTC is a nice best-of-both-worlds between cards and cash. For example, someone can't screw me over my replaying the transaction like they can with cards.

You're right that Satoshi's reference to blk*.dats were proxy to the blockchain proper.

Oh god. Can't even tell if that's Whoa-verse or Who-a-verse. The former sounds like something from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.
No wonder their MO is to copy Reddit bit-for-bit instead of trying anything new. They botched the one thing they changed: the name... twice.

You erase the "but I was wrong" part (the humility) out of their "I thought it was impossible but I was wrong" quote, and then you want to give the speaker of the quote a pep talk in humility.
Spare us, please.

To be fair, even OP admits that the events are only "probably connected".
I've been suspended from Coinbase because I didn't have my date of birth punched in, and I had to initiate contact with their support to find out why. Though they sorted things out within 5 minutes of me setting my date of birth.

 is a service that lets you generate "cold addresses" where money received goes to their cold storage, so sending money will be taken (mixed) from their hot wallet. For instance, I accept payments to MP cold addresses and then immediately send the money to addresses in my local wallet.
I never used SharedCoin though, so I'm not sure exactly what you're looking for.
@_date: 2015-06-03 10:53:46
 blk*.dat files are just the binary received over the wire. It's not the "canonical" blockchain or anything.

AWS t2.small EC2 instance. Pretty sure a t2.micro can keep up once synced, but you need to make it a t2.small or t2.medium for the initial sync.

Moneypot is interesting because they offer a gambling API to make it easier to start a casino. 
See:  (a dice site hosted on Github)
The other services I find interesting aren't what you would prob consider a startup.

Huh? Handling resource scarcity is baked into Bitcoin.

It's on the github link above. They were building a db on top of leveldb (basic primitives) and probably realized it was wayyy too low level (and hard) for a forum.

Meanwhile, I've been running a sex stories website for three years now and google has me slapped with a duplicate content penalty because some users have ported over stores from the alt.sex.stories usergroup.
This site just iframes/copies blockchain.info wholesale and then uses backlink farms to boost their rankings every time.

Cocaine doesn't fry you after "a few hours or days" man. You build tolerance quickly, sure, but frying generally means permanent damage in context of drugs.
Nothing beats cocaine when you want some cocaine though. 
You know, like when you're going to a concert with a girl you're trying to hook up with and you want to impress her with your shriveled up speed dick where you have to turn down sex after she fruitlessly gives your limp lillypad dick a blowjob for 15 minutes. Cocaine lets me relive that 3-4 times a year, it's a great experience for all. Makes me feel like a man.
@_date: 2015-05-22 05:53:17
That's a bit unfair considering that his service provider was the weak link behind this incident.
Also, bitcointalk is a big target. Every other bitcoin forum doesn't even get our attention much less an attacker's.
@_date: 2015-05-22 06:31:53
No, it's still in development. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 16:38:16
Because the price fluctuates. You act like it's always going up.
Imagine everyone that sold all their bitcoin at $1200 a year ago. Think they're having trouble getting their hands on some more bitcoin with the money they made? No, they could buy even more.
Also, what you're describing is called speculation. Part of speculation is to sell at what you think are local maximas.

Even google has advanced options behind some sort of "advanced" menu for power users.
I agree that they should keep it simple and the default UI should be good enough for 80% of users, but fee selection -- take it or leave it -- is how miners prioritize transactions. I've had no issues with breadwallet either, so maybe you're right, but I don't think this sort of UI should be completely off the table if it comes up in the future.
@_date: 2015-05-25 16:55:14
note: bitcoin already has a process for providing access to blocksize scarcity. 
it's the transaction fee. the "voluntary conservation" thing was probably a joke, but it's misleading.
 
@_date: 2015-05-23 16:28:21
Then they should use standard fees.
Here's a simple UI solution, maybe hidden behind an "advanced..." dropdown:
    [HighPriority] [MediumPriority] [LowPriority]
                          ^
                       default
I don't like the exact wording, but it's a lot simpler than just asking "how many bits would you like to set as fee?"
@_date: 2015-05-23 20:24:18
And many think they're called "bitcoins" plurally. lol, casuals.
@_date: 2015-05-23 01:06:49
Sure, it's relative. But if you're building a forum from scratch, just use Postgres. Rolling your own abstraction around leveldb gives you nothing but flexes your intellectual muscle and procrastinates the launch.
@_date: 2015-05-29 16:16:03
So, it's just a way to more directly pay for visibility and invisibility?
Why do people think this is a good idea?
@_date: 2015-05-22 10:44:16
Looks like the same people are building it all this time.
Also looks like they switched from building-a-DB-from-scratch to using Postgres a few months ago, so they might actually finish it within the year.

it's nice to get over the psychological hump of deleting tabs that you want to read. but with hundreds of tabs archived so far, i really don't see myself ever going "hmm, i'm going to find some reading material in my OneTab" :(
@_date: 2015-05-29 16:34:26
Exactly. 
That's why I use  cold addresses. I receive money there and then re-send it to my bitcoin wallet. The bitcoin stays in their cold wallet and they send me money from their hot wallet.
You have to tumble your money somehow if you want privacy.  is another option, but I use MP because it's a 1% fee and slightly higher with shapeshift.

If the client has the private key, use bitcoinjs.
If the server has the private key, use any server-side library that can do this, not bitcoin core.
If you're using Node on the server, use bitcoinjs on the server.
Converting a prvkey-&gt;pubkey is trivial btw. Should be a single library function.

My favorite combo:
- Breadwallet for wallet [
- Moneypot (online service) cold addresses for mixing and then sending to breadwallet [

- OPERATOR: That's terrible.
- HAxOR: Yup. I need to get back in to fix some stuff.
- OPERATOR: I understand. How are you locked out Thermos?
- HAxOR: I lost my password or something. I usually keep it here on my desk. It's too hard to remember. I have hard passwords for security because bitcointalk is real important.

- OPERATOR: Have you tried the password reset function at the control panel.
- HAxOR: That's the thing. I can't get into the control panel.

Sure. You could devise a protocol that fits `{threadId: 42, text: 'hello world'}` across a bunch of transactions where `text` will have to get chunked when it reaches a certain length. And then you could write a script that then scans the blockchain and builds a forum from this data.

Doesn't matter what the "purpose" is of the attacks. The fact that it can happen means that it will happen, and that it's happening forces the hand of the network to figure out either a fix or come to a philosophical conclusion about what Bitcoin is for and if this is acceptable.

Internet connectivity started by piggy-backing on the telephone infrastructure (free since you were already paying for your telephone line). We now pay money for access to internet data cables.
People pay money for better bandwidth. You're free to go back to dial-up, but you probably won't.
In other words, someone has to bear the cost of more bandwidth.
