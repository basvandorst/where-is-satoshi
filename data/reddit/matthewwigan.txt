Anyone can trade using bots

You, sir, are one of the true heroes of this space!  Enjoy your well-earned retirement.  I hope that the world treats you as kindly as you have treated it!

Don't worry, mate, go to coinmarketcap and check the history, you'll see it's up and down all the time (but mainly up)

Maybe its not for you.

Why not just get a hardware wallet instead? Eg. Nano S Ledger
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:32:18
This would be my guess too!

I think a nano s is about as secure as you can get, but as an investment it might take a while for your BTC to recover that cost.  If you plan on increasing your BTC over time then its well worth it for the peace of mind, but there are other secure ways too.  like an airgapped laptop or something...

I tried for hours to set up a node, but I kept getting errors that I couldn't fix.  I imagine as it grows less technical versions will be released and it will become a virtuous circle of adoption...  
Unfortunately, at my level of expertise I'll be following the  grannies and granddads into this future though...

A while ago I posted a picture from the bar of the sign saying that cash was not accepted:
 the story has now been taken up by a local news outlet, which explorers bitcoin a little too. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 08:27:43
Yes, I agree, the article does explorer the negatives a little (eg. people without banks being frozen out, lack of anonymity, etc).

Satoshi?  Is that you???
