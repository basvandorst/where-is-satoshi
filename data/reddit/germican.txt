With integration of things like waggle on the Hive wallet I think the ease of use is already there for bitcoin. The issue is spending it right now. The everyday person still can't really use them with out searching out who accepts it. Big companies are starting to accept it and if someone like Amazon gets in the mix it might be what finally tips the scale to make it worthwhile. Regulations well need to still be defined as it is still a grey area in most areas and that might hinder people from choosing to use it. Then there are tax issues because I know most people dont want to make their taxes even not complex and risk doing it wrong with it still not clearly defined. 
I think they need to wait just a bit longer.

It's purely a gamble for those involved if they can be quick enough. The problem is someone has to lose. So those that lose think that they will do better next time since now the are more experienced. 
One of them stated he does not prebuy the coin that he picks... Do I believe that prob not but there is most likely even more money to be had buying up all the panic sellers at the end of the pump. So I bet they do that as well

It's there a way the tenant can price s/he paid you with bitcoins if you try to evict on the grounds that you never received payment? I know this is a big reason cash isn't a good idea to pay rent with. I could see a landlord stating they never received payment and if the tenant provides the address the bitcoins were sent to the landlord could say it's not his address. 
Rent is very different than buying consumer goods as it is a contract to use something for X period of time.

I'm a fan of Seedcoin (SFI) on Havelock. It's right now dirt cheap and 3 of the companies invested in look to be doing very well. In top of that it's ran buy guys that are experienced in start ups and have the networking to allow the companies to grow much better than if they did it alone.  
Disclaimer : I'm invested in them. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 18:04:28
The issue is conversion of bitcoins into a useable fiat currency. Bitcoin is amazingly cheap to send anywhere. However if you have to purchase the bitcoins you have the fee set by what ever exchange you use. Then if you transfer to another country and they have to convert to Fiat currency you have to pay the fee of whatever place is turning it to fiat. 
So right now I don't know if it is the best route to do things however eventually once adoption grows and either bitcoin is more accepted or there are more competition lowering the fees then it will be much much cheaper. 
Right now mexbt has a strong focus on this from the USA to Mexico. With fees not being too bad in the USA and their site having reasonable fees they seem to be doing fairly well and much cheaper than say Western Union to send. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 05:00:34
I think it's a long term thing. Each transaction is added to the block chain. In the short term it won't do much but if it continues for years it just adds than many more transactions to that chain making hashing in mining even more difficult. 
Will it have an effect... Only time will tell but people certainly are trying.

Uhhh *places tinfoil hat on top of your head* there we go perfect. 
Your really down play the complexities in the loan system. Are there quite a bit of predatory loans yes but while used irresponsibility they will hurt you they have good utility if you have no other options. Good example is payday loans they are insanely predatory and very expensive. These loans are out there so when some one who has no other means for financial help has an emergency like their only car breaks down and needs repairs that they can't afford to get to work they can use this service. This sets you back even more but if you had no other option the benefit of not losing your job because you can't get there is more than worth it. 
The issue here isn't loans that are agreeable.  Also another great example is student loans. I could have never paid for my schooling by my self now I'm over 250,000 in debt with a 8.4% interest rate... The issue wasn't the predatory loans that I can't get rid by any means it is the rapid expansion and cost of higher education. 
Loans don't create the problems and if used correctly actually can make the situation a bit better. Loans simply use the fact that they have capital and that people want that capital to their advantage.  There is usually another issue at play.

Then the error is in your way of explaining. Most reddit users will not go to a site if it doesn't give them a reason to. After reading your explanation I had no desire or reason to because most ideas on here are crap with the rare exception.

Uhhh... Seems like a high cost for getting customers.
If a new user doesn't even refer anyone you need to some how profit what ever $50 averagly would result in gift cards. So either you have to make a lot off each person or your chances of getting gift cards is very low compared to how much you must spend. 
Secondly either there is nothing in the website except a few clip arts and some phrases plus the sign up and that's it. 
Sorry guys either learn to scam better or learn how to build a business better either way your not doing a very good job.

@_date: 2014-01-09 16:31:10
They control the majority of backup logs of transactions of the coins they mine while having 51% so they can send those coins to some one then alter the transaction log to say they didn't send it. Now the system checks vs all transaction logs and goes with the one that has more logs saying the same thing. Since they have 51% the system will say what they have in their logs is correct and remove the coins from where ever they sent it and put it back in their wallet to spend again. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 19:36:48
Loans are much much more useful than that. There are quite a bit of strategic uses for them in business where the opportunity outweighs the interest. Consumer goods aren't like that but let's say you get a loan for $1000 today but a bitcoin and in a half a year sell it at 2000...You made more than the bank did. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 14:42:26

Ahhh but you again forget that availability of loans does not mean utilization. If your offered those loan interest rates on houses your going to be much much less likely to purchase a house. The root of our education cost was the over valuation of a education, a increasingly competitive workplace due to increasing automation and the push by society that "to do well you have to go to college or else you'll work at McDonald's". I initially these views are what pushed to increase loan availability because politicians thought "What could go wrong with trying to create an even more educate population".  Well hindsight is 20/20 and we recognize this but politically no one will say cut education loans... Well Ron Paul did but look how that turned out. Loans didn't create this but you better believe they took the opportunity to use it to their advantage.

What's your plan? What's your angle? I don't know but an offer of $50 bonus for my sign up is just unrealistic. Damn, you don't even have a site other than a basic page with clip art that took maybe 10 minutes to make. I don't trust you and I don't think others should either. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:55:53
No because they only have the ability to do it to coins they mine while they have that 51% 
@_date: 2014-11-03 16:17:21
I think there are two reasons. 
1. Someone has personal interest in bitcoin doing poorly. Either through shorting out selling things. (some may fall in this but I don't think most do) 
2. People legitimately think it's a bad technology that is getting hyped to scam others. Like is you saw a friend in a multi-level marketing company and you think they are throwing their money away. 
The second is what I think makes up most of them. When you look at posts of people who lost a lot of money on bitcoin ie buy in at 1k now look at it. This is because of the stage bitcoin is in. It's speculation which means hype is all that matters for the price. Many people are hyping bitcoin for personal financial gain short term. When you put thousands of dollars into something and start to see the price drop your going to do what ever you can to try to get the price back up and in most cases that means trying to create more hype. What does this do if successful on an individual level such as friends and family? They buy in but it's not enough hype  to change the market so the price continues down and now you've lost money and so has the people you convinced to join in. 
I think this is what most buttcoiners feel they are protecting. And rightfully so because if I'd have push someone into bitcoin when I thought the price was really low ($500) I'd feel like shit today because I got them to do that. Even my girlfriend wanted me to invest some of her money and trade it because I was doing well but I refused to because if I lose my money that's my problem but if I lost hers that's our problem but my fault. Told her if she wanted to she could but I wouldn't do it for her because I simply wasn't confident in what bitcoin would do short term. I hype it a ton to her but if that's all she hears it's a very biased decision if she put her money in. 
On top of this because hype and wider acceptance is needed for success it creates a cult like image where people identify themselves by bitcoin. This is an easy target to hit for them as well. Honestly we make it to easy of a target. 
TL;DR we did this to ourselves by having such investment in a speculative product that we risk others financial wellbeing to advance our own.

When a currency was up at 1200 USD in value drops to 200 to 300 it is much more likely for a person to think about buying their first bitcoin than when it was up in the 700 to 800.
High price for the visibility to the masses public then the lower it drops the more people will buy into the system.

Got in after the first crash from $1200 got my attention. Bought small amounts on the way down. Lost about 1k to 2k between trading and the devaluation. Went balls deep at 230s and then into augur. Sold my Rep on launch paid off my wedding/vacation moved some into an investment outside of Bitcoin and now sitting with about what I ended with when I stopped buying in the 230s. 
Over all made a good amount but there were some rough patches. Most valuable thing is what I learned from the experience and that 1 to 2k was money well spent to learn what I did.
Edit: never feel victim to a hack in my 3 years around here. Mainly due to luck but I never kept my coins anywhere long so it  was like hitting a moving target.

Who is putting money only into bitcoin for retirement? 
Do people not realize that you build a portfolio of assets that has multiple things in it. Some may be stocks others real estate and throw in some bitcoin for example. No one is saying bitcoin will set you for life and if they are then they have no clue what they are saying. 
If I could put 5k in today and pull out 100k in 10 years then put that money into other markets I will have a substantial increase after a total of 40 years. 
My view of bitcoin is its high risk but can create a fairly good financial foundation to build on if you play it right. It's not going to build you a house you still have to do that on your own but it makes everything down the road easier if bitcoin is successful.

So much negativity about trading. Honestly the only difference between trading with $5 vs $50,000 is the amount you move the market when you buy and sell. Most places have fees that are percents. The issue is it is a highly manipulated market and to be able to predict it is very difficult. With just $5 I say what's there to lose? If bitcoin reached its all time high again then you are at about $20 again not much to lose to learn how markets work and trading. While I've lost some in the beginning one you learn good risk mitigation technique you shouldn't lose much if a trade goes bad. Don't do leveraged when learning even though it is tempting.

More buying than selling = move up in price. Currently most selling is by miners and payment processors plus your occasional bear whale dumping on the market.

With a matured financial environment and proper regulations some institutions will likely act similar to credit agencies.

It's how he handled it and the reddit post about Garza earlier that morning as well. Personally that's enough for me to look elsewhere because if a major issue arose I do not trust in his ability to handle the PR aspects. Again it's a personal decision of what your limit is for what's acceptable.

He fucked up then wanted reddit to form a mob to correct his mistake. He didn't take ownership for not reading his emails or checking the website forums for announcements. He push the blame onto others instead of realizing his errors and correcting it or at least preventing it from happening again. This is not leadership this is a guy trying to advance his own agenda by any means. Integrity is key and after yesterday I think he doesn't have any.

So please then define what is required to be acceptable? What is the line that needs to be drawn. Where are they required to post it on reddit or bitcoin talk? They have a responsibility to inform  members and what constitutes informing members is where everyone has to decide what is acceptable. 
3 to 4 emails sent to every member is more than acceptable in my view. The question to you is why are you not reading emails from the foundation intently enough to understand the content? 
It would be one thing if this was a government or business organization that represents a large group. This foundation doesn't. This foundation is a self created group that wants to help integrate bitcoin into our current world and aid adoption. Since they have no true authority over bitcoin rather only have the image of authority based on how the public recognizes it then there is nothing stopping you from setting out on your own and creating a new foundation that embraces the values you hold. 
While I wouldn't recognize either one but I do understand that in a centralized world those not involved in bitcoin will search for the leadership (such as the media or government agents). The the foundation did a good job of putting high profile individuals in leadership positions to further the image of having legitimate authority over bitcoin. 
So quite honestly either follow their rules or create your own organization. They didn't hide rules from you. They didn't try to manipulate votes against you (I think it's more likely they were trying to be more conservative in this area to avoid vote manipulation hence the rules). 
What you feel should be done doesn't really matter if the majority don't agree with you and from the looks of this thread you likely have some but not the majority. 
Learn your lesson and be prepared for the next time. Be vigilant and read the emails from the organization you want a leadership position in. As well push those that are part of the foundation that also didn't realize they had to activate to do the same. If a group is trying to take a leadership position over bitcoin they better be organized in a manner that everyone is knowledgeable on what the foundation is doing when they are  personally sent that information.

@_date: 2015-02-15 16:35:10
His actions taken sound to me like other motives are in place especially after you indicate he read 3 of the 4 emails. In the bitcoin world it's hard to trust anyone. Everyone is trying to make money or advance their position of power. I'm not completely against the foundation as we need a centralized leadership team as those not involved in bitcoin such as most of the media will look for a leadership group to ask questions and provide guidance. But the foundation can be easily corrupted and those with purely selfish motives can gain power from it. 
It's a needed evil so we just have to be very cautious and diligent. 
Edit: good luck in your decision who ever you choose. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 01:50:22
It would be one thing if this was a recognized body that speaks for bitcoin but it's not. A group set up the foundation and put high profile people on it. This isn't a board of directors or governing body it's a self appointed group that can have what ever rules it wants. Don't like how they do it then a different group can be created and try to seek the same goal but with different values and processes. Then the market can decide who they recognize as being a figure head for bitcoin. Being activly involved in the foundation does not seem unrealistic for being able to vote. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 23:16:00
So start using the forms of media that they use. I can't bitch that I didn't get an announcement from my work because they didn't post it on reddit since most of my employees browse reddit.
It's not unreasonable to post announcements on their message board AND email you.

Strong focus on transmission of wealth. Things like cash or gold need some type of third party or the items physically traded in person. The third party say a bank is trusted to verify the person actually has the money. 
Say I want to buy something I use a debit card that the bank authorizes the purchase telling the merchant that I have enough to buy the item and then I take the item. It isn't till that night that the money is ever transmitted plus if they think there is something wrong the van just cancel the order or do a charge back. 
The third party has power to do whatever it wants to the transaction. Bitcoin is different. The third-party is replaced by the blockchain that is public record of all transactions. 
I buy something for 0.1 bitcoin the person receives that bitcoin right then. It is then confirmed by the blockchain to be valid. And that's it the transaction is done. They can't take the bitcoins back via a charge back. Nor can anyone alter the transaction plus it is now public record on the blockchain. Well your address will be but you can change addresses easily. 
Best anology is its like using all the benefits of cash but similar to how you use debit but even more benefits. 
The down sides are security right now. If you don't secure it then it's like I have cash sitting around that any hacker can take like you had cash sitting by an open window. 
The biggest barrier is adoption. Why would consumers go through the extensive process to use bitcoin if they don't see any advantage. Look at it honestly vs debit. I go into the store to buy milk I slide my card and I take milk home that's for debit. For bitcoin I go to the store use my wallet to pay for the milk in bitcoin than take the milk home. 
See much of a difference at the consumer level? Nope its basically the same. It's everything beyond consumer level that benefits. No crazy credit card processing fees, no wait to get the funds, no risk of charge backs. All of these increase the merchants prices as they have to account for this.
But how do you get those to use bitcoin that dont see our care about these behind the scenes benefits.

For all VC or seed funding unless you have a lot of capital (to them not you) in them honestly your usually not worth their time. They are busy and taking even 10 minutes to respond to someone with only a couple hundred invested just isn't worth it. These aren't large companies with customer service departments like traditional investment firms. 
So you kinda have to expect them to be a bit rude. While I agree they have been less than professionals at times in the way they presented themselves they followed through on a majority of their promises and while there have been several bumps they have done what they needed to to keep a majority of their real investors happy. This came at the cost to many smaller investors but honestly if your investing very small amounts of capital you can't expect them to bend things in your favor. 
The companies they invested in though I love and coinsimple currently is one that stayed quiet for a while and is just now pushing their product and I love the market they are targeting.

While I as well am skeptical let's look at the situation. This guy got several big players to invest the most ever invested in a blockchain related company with no working business. Look at coinbase they have been functioning for a while and can show their market share. 
How did he convince them to give him that much and that he could turn it into profit for them? I have no clue but he must have done something right. Plus with the amount invested those large players will not want to see him fail so they will be advising him rather well most likely. 
I'm optimistic only due to the stage the company is in and the amount invested by large players... It's very unusual.

Uhhh you could invest in ETFs which is much less volatile and much lower risk. We really haven't hashed out all the details, risks, concerns that bitcoin may bring plus regulation can slow adoption. 
I'm a huge bitcoin person but let's be realistic stocks are much lower risk.

In most investing you only take the tax hit when you convert the money to fiat. Most investments work this way for example in the USA if I buy real estate then sell it a few years later for a gain if I use that money only to buy new real estate I don't have to pay taxes on the gains. This being the general philosophy of most investing that you get taxed when you take it out leads me to believe this is fairly safe method and arguable if I need to defend myself. 
The only issue is if they consider bitcoin a currency which they currently don't. If they did then you may have to do each transaction as a taxable event.

82% did not activate when properly informed. A majority of bitcoin users are young adults that are not professionals so that doesn't surprise me. 
The percentage of active members doesn't really matter what needs to be assessed is if the process they used was acceptable. 
Is emailing members 3 to 4 times to the personal email address provided by the member an acceptable means to inform them about the process to vote an acceptable process? 
I would say yes. So i think this mistake is on you and the 82% who doesn't follow the process that was specifically told to you.

It's the panic at the end of a bubble. Those who invested fear the investment is dying and they have to sell to salvage something of their investment. As people do that it pluges us deeper and deeper down. I think the week preceeding and just after the dip to 165 was that part of the cycle. But that's just my opinion and can't support it other than having higher than usual dumps and high volume. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 18:06:12
Agreed. Most bitcoin people are younger and don't have much exposure to financial markets or how to even invest traditionally. This is also why bitcoin looks kinda like a cult from the outside as a majority don't have a strong understanding in this area and are going out shouting about how great it is and everyone should invest. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 02:18:11
Because regardless of if we like it or not those not in bitcoin (media would be the biggest one) are going to assume the leadership that claim to have over bitcoin is true. They will use that against what bitcoin is and that can reduce the rate of adoption. 
Everything is centralized in our current world with leadership over it so those who don't know how bitcoin functions will assume the same and look to talk to those figure heads. 
So either we need to ensure this one is a good representation or have a new organization step up. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 23:31:47
No because that graph is just a example of if there was just one big bubble. Instead view the graph as each cycle of bubbles and how that would have played out of their was just one bubble before going public. 
We had bubbles before that followed this same path and I expect at minimum one more when big plays with multi millions get involved or big financial institutions buy in

It's one thing if your investing hundreds of thousands of dollars or more. If your looking at a personal finances level I doubt the irs is going to come after your as long as you are paying roughly what you should based off assumptions like above. If I can argue that this is how most personal investments are viewed and I am doing the same for bitcoin due to the amount of ambiguity I highly doubt much trouble. 
If you're looking for higher levels of investment then a lawyer is your best bet. The irs will care if you don't pay at all. Pay it but like all tax code pay what is reasonable based off of the ambiguity.

What makes it excessive? What is considered reasonable for voting on leadership? 
Regardless of how much you like the foundation the leadership have power and the media's ear so the steps they requested for confirmation of active members looks to be too minimize the risk of manipulation of vote. This is exactly what Fenton seems to think is happening to him by having these requirements. But this was publically communicated via emails and on their site so I can't see that being a valid excuse to not following the requirements.

Most people already think money is transmitted like bitcoin is. The concept of centralized vs decentralized is hard to understand when your entire life almost everything has been centralized. 
If they go to PayPal or their bank and send money or even buy something with a debit card the end result whether it is with bitcoin or debit is the same. I send money to X person they receive it instantly. That's the consumer level and anything beyond that is harder to understand. The fact that authorization is only transmitted can be confusing because they got the product. But behind the scenes the centralized system is doing its thing and consumers are blind to it unless they research it. 
To a consumer whether you user bitcoin or fiat they see the same result but bitcoin is unstable and the people pushing it at times can give off a cult level feel. Most will look at you like your selling a multi level marketing product.

If you're looking for consumer level investments you won't find and serious businesses any more as large private seed investors and VC have jumped in. I invested in Seedcoin SF1  and personally think that was one of the only legitimate ones. 
If you're looking for private high capital investing I'd go to expos to see new startups. Or get involved with VC companies like Tally Capital.

I'd review the up vote vs down votes on a majority of posts negative is bad and indicates the community does not agree with you. I certainly don't after yesterday and I'm not even down voting you. 
Honestly you fucked up by not knowing the bylaws and looks like you were hoping to rally reddit behind you to correct the error in your part. Leadership includes integrity and accountability and from what I've seen in your posts you lack both. It's one thing if they changed the bylaws without notification but they did notify you via email several times and they indicated you even read most of them. 
Own your fuck up and don't project it off into others as their fault and then maybe you could start reclaiming some of the image you had. Until that happens your activly the type of person that I think would slow down bitcoin adoption and you do not present the image of a strong leader.

People love to complain when it advances others agenda but when it advances their agenda they are OK with it. 
Integrity is crucial in advancing a technology that is constantly attacked as being used for illegal means. And that doesn't seem to be one of their priorities.
