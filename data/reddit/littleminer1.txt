I think they have, but it was so little or they didn't care so it doesn't matter. The problem is when someone loss their coins and they care, that will be a shitshow, i hope it doesn't happen. And btw i'm not a bcash supporter, i sold it all mine when it was at 300, no regrets.

Go away and read how it works. In the future maybe the goverment will try to control it, and i think they will not be sucesfull, but right now the process of bitcoin is spread all around the world by litle people, like me for example. And with your thinking i asume you're American, in others country we don't think our country is the center of the world, well maybe some Europeans do, newsflash it's a global network so being created or backed by the US goverment don't make any sense because in the history of USA, with the shady shit, they always do centralization first so they have more power, and the majority of cryptos are the oposite of that. So relax and read the whitepaper to gain some insight how this thing works.

And why is an insult?? Not because your enemys call it a certain way it means is an insult, for the record it's just a abreviation.

We can know who has the bitcoins, that's how it was detected, but if you don't know who is the controller of the addres you can't know who stole your btc...
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:31:23
Well you just explain fiat, well done. That is not what bitcoin is about.

Just look a the number of transactions of each chain  if more people wanted BCH the transactions would have skyrocket but they are at only 90 tx per block, and remember the block got increase to 8mb. So what i believed is large players with a lot of BCH and BTC are manipulating the market. Maybe is not a pump and dump in the technical sense but it isn't a normal market response.

Is really simple really. It doesn't matter how much you sent, well the inputs and outputs matter but not that much, what matters is what the others are paying before and after you. For example, imagine you go to a bank but for a withdraw you have to pay a fee, it can be low as 1 cent but they only accept 1000 people every 10 min and the higest fees in the moment. That's how it works.

BCH has only 90 tx per block  meanwhile BTC has 2150 and a 1/4 of the limit in space per block compared to BCH. 
The definition of useless is a thing without use. Which of the two fit the description??

Hey, i'll agree in almost all things you said except of Doge being a memecoin, what's the problem of that?? They're been business with a lot of money that start it with a meme. And that is not being developed, Doge may not have the numbers of devs like bitcoin but they're active and don't fix something if it isn't broken.

The bitcoin network has achieved many concensus in the past, fucking segwit was a concensus. And if you think the NYA was consensus you really don't understand bitcoin or blockchain for that matter, i run full node and they never ask me if i agree with the NYA...
PD: And sorry for commenting in almost all your comments. I am little drunk, lol, and i hate the ignorance and argumments without proof. Take care.

You're making asumptioms like crazy. I have only 500usd in crypto and i'm more than happy to spend my coins instead of opening a credit card account. Not everyone is like you.
@_date: 2017-10-15 08:30:30
Fuck, i'm drunk.

If wath you are saying is true your comment will be deleted. I will wait to see if your right but i seriously doubt it...

Yes, the core developers say that we need to increase blocksize eventually. The key word is "eventually" not by a hard fork with like 2 developers.
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:04:41
And the difficulty will decreased. It will be okay.
