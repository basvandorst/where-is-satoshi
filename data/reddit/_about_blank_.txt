i suggest you split your money 50/50 on BTC and BCH.    
(personally i would not invest any money in BTC anymore)

nobody can answer that question but you. and maybe not even you if your brain stops working properly because of greed, despair or any other reasons.
10k is a lot of cash.
people already said it: if you dont "need" this money and dont have a certain thing you are saving it for - you could go ahead and do it. but keep in mind that it is a risk investment.

best method: buying them.

The most efficient way would be to sign up at an exchange and not simply buy the currency (bitcoin), but to place a limit order on it for a price that very most likely will be filled soon after you placed your order.
this way (at least on coinbase) you dont pay any fees. 0. zero.
because you are the maker of the deal, not the taker.
thats the cheapest way to buy bitcoin.

worst possible scenario:
you sell your bitcoins now

dont do it. as already stated:
if YOU buy it with fiat money, you are accountable for taxes.
that might not bother you right now, but if you make high profits and are a long time holder, it can cost you a lot of money and/or big trouble with the IRS / any other financial department of your country

buying bitcoin is not the subject.
but selling it for fiat money is.
selling bitcoin for real money will make you accountable for taxes. in what specific way depends on several factors.
so you better document all your purchases on any coin.
because if you cant prove when and how much bitcoin you bought, you might get taxed with the highest amount of taxes (varies from country to country). thats too big of a topic to write it all down here and you are free to google. dont tell me you cant find anything with keywords like "bitcoin taxes" on google ;)
