I found him. Getting in on that butt crack action. He said he’d make an exception for me, since I’m a “cute guy” ☺️

Get a Roth IRA with vanguard and invest it into VTSAX. Max it out every year.

$6000 a year if you can. It’s tax free when you withdraw it

Ok, so IRAs (individual retirement funds) come in two flavors: Roth &amp; Traditional. In a traditional IRA your contributions are tax deductible and in the Roth withdrawals are tax free. Most people recommend the Roth, because, I believe, tax rates seem to have a downward sloping trend.
You can open a Roth IRA (or traditional) through a number of different brokerages. Some of the most popular are Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade and Vanguard. I use Vanguard because they have low fees and I like the site.
VTSAX is vanguard’s total market index fund. Essentially what it does is buys you into the entire stock market, rather than shares of individual companies. You can expect about a 10 percent compounding  return on these investments, long term. I say long term because the stock market can be volatile at times you’ll be at a loss. That’s ok because historically with every dip there has been a mountain larger in scale. 
Do it now, if you haven’t already. If I max mine out  every year conservative estimates say I’ll have over a million dollars when I retire. Of course one million won’t be worth one million then, but I’ll still be much better off than if I let that money sit in a sack by a account.

“Actual value would mean I could carry and access it whenever and wherever I wanted, and without being forced to give away my ID and credit score.”
Yeah like money
