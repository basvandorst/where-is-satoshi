I followed [these]( instructions to set up offline transaciton signing.
Electrum is very lightweight, so there were very few packages that I had to install on my offline computer to get version 1.9.8 working (needed python-setuptools and python-qt4 from the cdrom repo, and then python-ecdsa and slowaes downloaded from github).
Once Electrum was working, I created a new wallet on the offline machine and copied the master public key to a usb drive.  Created a new wallet on my online computer, using the master public key to make a watch-only wallet.
I suppose to make things easier, you could start with an internet connected computer to install Electrum and its dependancies, then disconnect it before wallet creation (and never connect it to the internet again).  I'm a little paranoid, so I sacrificed an older netbook by removing the wifi card and filling in the ethernet port with epoxy.

You can always [run your own Electrum server]( - that was the appeal for me.

Thanks for the tip!  Let me know if you have any other questions and I'll try to help.

I bought some bitcoin stickers using openbazaar - fun, but still needs a lot of work!

This is ultimately where I want to be with my bitcoin storage.
3of5 multisig addresses where I have to sign a tx with my offline Electrum install, my Trezor and my everyday computer.
I played around with Electum 2.0's multisig address wallets, that looks pretty promising but I couldn't figure out a way to integrate the Trezor.  Since you can get the pubkey of a Trezor address you can make a multisig address from it and a cold-storage Electrum wallet address, but if you can't get the Trezor to load and sign the tx then you'd end up potentially compromising the Trezor seed to get the private key (using a site like [this](

It also makes cold-storage of your bits easy.
And has upcoming Trezor support.

Was just about to post this.  Hooray!

Electrum 1.9.8 (and 2.0 if you build from source) works great for me as well on Yosemite.
I installed Multibit to check an old wallet, and had to install Java first. It worked just fine, although I didn't test sending any BTC.
Electrum uses a 12 word seed, so backing up is easy.  2.0 also supports the Trezor - which works great and is very secure.  I keep coins both in the Trezor and Electrum's cold-wallet storage for now.

When you create a wallet with the Trezor and Electrum, the Trezor's 24 word seed is used.  The new wallet is basically a 'watch-only' version until the Trezor is plugged in and unlocked.  Once your bits are transferred to the Trezor, you wouldn't need the 12-word Electrum seed anymore.
I have very little confidence that I can memorize 24 words and retain them for any amount of time.  My Trezor seed is stored in a secure location, and since I also use a passphrase, I'm not worried about the seed itself being compromised. Remebering a complex passphrase is less work for me :)

I created two paper wallets using a copy of [bitcoinpaperwallet.com]( on an offline computer, enabling BIP38 encryption for both.  Copied the uncompressed public keys to my internet-connected computer and made a multisig address from them (bitcoin-cli createmultisig 2 ["PUBKEY1","PUBKEY2"]).  If you don't want to save the resulting redeemScript, you can re-create it any time by running the createmultisig command again making SURE you use the same order for the pubkeys.  Sent btc to the resulting multisig address.
A handy site that's open source and helps you create multisig addresses and transactions is [coinb.in/multisig]( After you send btc to your new multisig address you can paste in the redeemScript and build a transaction to spend your bits.  Creating a transaction this way can be very dangerous if you don't understand the need for change addresses - all inputs have to be spent somewhere, either to a change address, back to the original multisig address, or you'll pay it to the miner that includes your tx in a new block.

Hey man. Thanks for being passionate!

You can leave your bitcoin folder untouched.  Bitcoin Core will rescan your blockchain, and as long as you end up at the same block height (you can check insight.bitpay.com when it's done updating) you have nothing to worry about.

They also have a tor mirror: bitmixer2whesjgj.onion
If you follow the directions to save and verify the Letter of Guarantee, keep in mind that it displays your deposit address and the forwarding address(es).  Probably something that you shouldn't keep after the mixing is done.

You can password protect your trezor in addition to the pin.  If you enter an incorrect password, the trezor will generate addresses for a wallet based on that incorrect password - in a 'rubber hose' situation you could provide your attacker with a password that unlocks your non-default wallet with only a few bits in it.

I think the fact all build options are viewable by running ./configure --help may be why they're not in /doc; however a pr to add it wouldn't take long so you may as well :)
@_date: 2016-01-23 19:16:28
Try ./configure --help in your source directory

You can disable the wallet at compile time, too. I believe it's just --disable-wallet
