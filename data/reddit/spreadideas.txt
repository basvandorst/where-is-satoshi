I hate banks and the idea of government interfering in what I own and I need to give taxes on every penny I spend, German government has made a good move in declaring it as "Private Money" the matter of fact is this technology is way better than current financial systems  and its just a matter of years when this will get adopted. These currencies are better form of exchange.
