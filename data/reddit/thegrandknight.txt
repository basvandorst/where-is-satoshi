'  but then they would own a lot of BTC and essentially be a 'majority shareholder' of bitcoin'
Respectfully, I disagree...
Once one really big entity figures out how to exploit the advantage others will follow suit.
@_date: 2016-04-19 18:07:21
First I wanted one. Then 3 seemed appropriate. Then I thought let's hold 10. But then I thought 21 is  noble number.....

I survived a similar attack and it was just some kind of grace that saved me from being totally wiped out.
Opsec is something you don't fully consider til it's shown to be faulty. 
Anyway, I've often thought if the hacker had been successful I would have had zero recourse.  Police and courts have not wrapped their minds around these concepts so making this case will be an uphill slog.

Just had the exact same experience with Canadian Capital One.  made several purchases from carbon money no problem. Got verified on their site and went to make some larger purchases but got blocked and diverted to the fraud department.  After 45 minute hold the guy comes on and asks if this site is for cryptocurrency. I confirmed that it was and then he said some nonsense about due to the risks to the customer and the blah blah Capital One bans the purchase of crypto. i had been expecting this so didn't get too upset but there you go.

The term empowerment refers to measures designed to increase the degree of autonomy and self-determination in people and in communities in order to enable them to represent their interests in a responsible and self-determined way, acting on their own authority. It is the process of becoming stronger and more confident, especially in controlling one's life and claiming one's rights .Empowerment as action refers both to the process of self-empowerment and to professional support of people, which enables them to overcome their sense of powerlessness and lack of influence, and to recognize and use their resources. To do work with power.

It's true 
I just got back from visiting my cousin and I was telling him about Bitcoin.
A few weeks later he messaged me asking questions and I thought good, he's keen.
When he asked how many I had,  against my better judgment I told him 
A few weeks later he wanted to borrow 20 thousand dollars because I obviously have it sitting around 
@_date: 2016-05-12 03:26:52
He checks out some bit coin machines in different neighborhoods.   Sometimes the btm only sell and he gets frustrated. Then he finds a good one at a comic book store.  Then he wants you to donate bit coin to him

The whole case rests upon the actions of OP. Had he exercised more discretion in releasing the BTC to this unknown party this wouldn't have happened. Deposits are reversed for all types of reasons. He should have been slightly  more circumspect IMHO

Once I took the red pill I never looked back
My mind would try and pull me toward doubt but I chose to invest in my faith evry week
