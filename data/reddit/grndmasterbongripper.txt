Are you only interested in sponsor from r/bitcoin or would you be willing to do a straight bitcoin sponsor for same cost? 
10 btc is lower than I expected, if those funds are not raised here than I am pretty sure I could drum them up from other bitcoin sites but they would want the bitcoin logo itself and not an r/bitcoin logo. Let me know if interested and I will see what can he done.

too bad it's still easier for the majority to go to the bank during banks hours than to acquire btc.

And how would these same folks be able to use btc?  It would be very difficult for them to acquire btc at fair costs, and then what would they do with it once they did have it? I doubt there is a hugs network of btc processors in this hypothetical place. Besides the issues of using btc,  how would these same people handle a 25 percent drop in value of their life savings?
I am definitely pro bitcoin but we are a long way from being ready for the masses, and even further away from conquering the world.

Where would the receivers sale the bitcoin without being ripped off?  We're talking about a lot of btc and they would most likely need immediate liquidity.  I love bitcoin as much as the next person on this sub but do not think it is really a viable solution for this problem.
