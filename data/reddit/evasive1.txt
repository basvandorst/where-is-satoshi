What will the new 2xBitcoin be called, do you know? Bitcoin Cash tried to.
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:01:54
Yeah what you and Jewie said makes sense. I don't know enough about Ethereum either, but if everything is consensus based and not just Bitcoin, I guess that the people who didn't want the ETH fork were in the minority. 
What a ride. The safe play seems to be investing in both coins. I find it weird that it seems a single (centralized?) company pretty much orchestrated the coup. You'd think that's definitely the bad guy, but then if you read between the lines supposedly the main bitcoin developers themselves weren't privy to some other agreements and deals being made by big players of core.
Shady stuff. If you're an investor, you just follow the money. If you introduce ethics it can get really confusing.

Gotta ask you guys since you're a part of the optimistic crowd, and I truly want to share in this outlook, how do you know this original BTC will continue such an upward trend if it forks again? I admittedly don't know much about the tech, but I've gathered that no one knows which version of BTC (including bitcoin cash apparently) people will adopt. On that note, what will determine the initial price of the 2x Segwit version? And will we be lucky enough to receive the same amount like we did with bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:27:11
What? I was just trying to figure out why the forks weren't similar. 
About the credit card analogy. It'd apply if VISA decided to start up a new company with better features, but the -newer- company got to retain the VISA name while the original company was stuck with being called VISA Classic. All I was asking was why didn't the new VISA company get called VISA Cash.
It sounds like you're saying it's definitely an alt coin and not really bitcoin. I don't know who to believe anymore, but I'll dig some more thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:14:29
Probably a stupid question, but in the interest of learning, does a hardware wallet wiping itself like that mean you personally have lost whatever you were storing on it as well? I'd hope it's all still retrievable with some kind of backup key redundancy thingie?
I should really just look this up, I know.
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:40:47
Gotcha, thank you for this explanation. Time to check which wallet supports the largest variety of coins!
@_date: 2017-08-19 02:10:50
No, not even close. All the people speculating 5k are probably spot on. 10k in a couple of years? Might be an understatement. The 50k in 5-10 year guys may be getting closer. And for all we know, the 1 million/BTC could be accurate one day.
It's an easy investment if you're willing to forget about it. I inadvertently turned a $20 purchase of NEM into almost $2000 because I literally forgot about it. Upon logging back into an exchange after a 1 year hiatus from crypto, I planned to withdraw whatever few dollars I had left and bounce. Now, that was from a combination of NEM going up as well as BTC, but I digress. I forgot about it and, as a result, avoided all of the moments in time where I likely would have sold it off for one reason or another.
Most of these exchanges are based off BTC. Wherever you get your BTC from, say Coinbase, you send it to an exchange, and then you use that BTC to invest in whatever alt-coin you want. There's a plethora of alt coins and they're all doing their own thing, but there will be even more that spring up as time goes on. And how do you think those are going to be funded/traded? BTC. This digital gold isn't only a store of wealth, but it's also essentially the currency used to keep the crypto market running. It's the dollar in Wall Street, except the dollar gets inflated. BTC is limited in supply.
I'd hedge a little bit into BCC because who the fork knows how things are going to play out by the year's end, but so far, no matter what caused the dips or how long they lasted, bitcoin has been the gift that keeps on giving.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:20:09
I'd say now. That definitely seemed to be "the dip."

Why did the Ethereum fork produce Ethereum Classic (which I presume was the original ETH)? And why didn't Bitcoin become Bitcoin Classic, with Bitcoin Cash staying "Bitcoin" ?
Or do I have the Eth fork backwards, and I'm just misunderstanding the use of classic here?

If you can get some and forget about it, don't pay attention to the dips and corrections, then hell yes.
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:55:37
The growths happen because of most of the things you said. The reason this time *may* be different is because of increased media exposure. You figure Tom Lee was just on CNBC stating that he thinks bitcoin will be the best performing asset this year -- and that's coming from Fundstrat which is predominantly all about traditional stock portfolios. Bitcoin is being publicized more than ever, so more of the general population is catching on. Worldwide. Coupled with increasing awareness that the supply is limited, you're seeing a "money grab" from people as fast as possible. I suspect even if there were a dip or correction, it would bounce back so quickly from people trying to get on the rocket before it's too late.
I do concur though, it's always best to be safe. 1) Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. 2) STOP LOSS. Set them if you have your BTC in an exchange, something substantially lower than the ATH you're currently witnessing. This way if it rebounds (but doesn't meet your stop loss amount) you're still golden.
TL;DR This time really may be different and, even if not, you'd be a fool not to invest something into BTC right now on the off-chance it does reach 5k or 10k. Set a stop-loss if you're worried. The worst case is you'll lose a little bit of your investment; Though honestly, I think even with a correction everyone should HODL the shit out your BTC. In the 5x dip everyone is talking about, the pattern has (eventually) been an insane recovery and rebound. The flight to the moon may be a bit rocky, but you WILL get there if you ride out the turbulence.
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:38:33
It is a staple name. Virtually all exchanges use the inherent value of bitcoin to trade the other 1234091841 cryptocurrencies. The majority of those coins will always have a value that reflects what BTC is doing. It's a high demand commodity with a limited supply. That ratio will increase the value of BTC as more people catch the fever and want their share. It really is like digital gold.
Keep holding it, because the trend is not definitely not pointing downward, and I don't think it ever will be.
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:07:57
Why couldn't the first time it dipped to 3800, and then ~3600 be the retrace or correction or whatever? Honestly curious. And do you know if it's historically and consistently hit past supports?

I see what you're getting at. I can buy ETH all day long, but BTC and LTC disabled. Except when I go to make a purchase, I get a conversion rate equal to the price when it was still up $500. Hmm.

Damn, I wanted to do that with silver around the same age. Good job.
That said, it's too flat for the physical properties making it super inconvenient to sell/ship out.
I'd get rid of it all personally, or maybe only hold onto certain bullions or ingots that are rarer than most since they have a higher value due to added collectibility.
I'd do some combination of the following:
Buy as much BTC possible for the fork, holding both coins until the dust clears.
Buy as much BTC after the fork when it looks like it has reached the bottom to you. No extra forked coin in this scenario but at least you already have some BTC right now.
Get deep with it and use around half the proceeds to buy LTC. It's poetic here being the "silver" to bitcoin's gold and only what like 50 or 60 per coin? Except I'm certain the value of LTC will actually keep stride and rise along with BTC. Hell I ought to buy some right now, I think it doubles anyone's money by 2018, maybe even within a few weeks after the fork.
Put some into altcoins with potential for much higher returns in the short-term, using profits from the spikes (if you want) to buy more BTC or to buy back the precious metal if you prefer. My personal bang-for-your-buck recommendations for huge growth through 2018, and yes ones I that I hold, are SYS, BAT, ADA, IOTA, and XVG. Maybe add some more expensive privacy coin like XMR, AEON ("monero lite"), or a fork of it like Sumokoin for good measure. I also think NAV, VTC, and VRC will continue to perform well.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:08:31
Depends on your perspective. I think you can have a higher profit margin, or leverage to make more, by simply buying a crypto you believe in and holding. But at the same time my cheap ass rig will generate like 1 ETH every 70 days? And that's over $100/month more than I had before, so I'll take it.

Speaking of, I've seen a lot of eBay sales of physical cards where the seller says they've generated wallet addresses/keys on a throwaway, ensuring privacy and security. It's left for the buyer to peel off a seal and then have access to what's usually an empty wallet at the time. The idea is to fill it with your own BTC and then hang onto it, pass it on as a gift, etc.
--- Is this not a huge security risk? I'm assuming of course that the seller is physically creating the card thus, at some point in time, has the potential to write down the key in fucking crayon if he wants, before covering it up. Then he could sell these empty wallets and monitor their activity for people who deposit a significant amount and/or don't bother to ever send it out of the physical wallet, and steal whatever amount he wants from the unsuspecting victim(s).

There will probably be a correction even if it's only caused by people who had converted their alts --&gt; bitcoin just for the fork; now that they will have received their "free" fork, they will want their alts back pronto while it's still at a good price. And since everything will, at first and for the most part, only be able to be bought with BTC, alts should bounce back as BTC dips.

Well said.
I am probably a part of the minority group that thinks there may not be a death spiral for either bitcoin or bitcoin cash. I can see them co-existing and, in fact, all of the legitimate alternative coins rising in value over time.
The most important point is to hold onto the coin(s) you believe in. Ride out the bullshit. Because it really is only a loss if you sell at one. Blockchain, crypto, this is all still new, and we've barely seen adoption. So despite the wild swings you'll experience if you're glued to the charts, I believe over time everything will appreciate as new money continues to come into the market.

Advice? Yeah, zoom out. No really, the whole picture, then imagine the point in time when this little correction is nothing in the face of the future uptrend.
If you believe in all the people forecasting bitcoin being worth 50k, 100k, 1 million USD one day, then you just have to have faith in that long-term hold because that's exactly how bitcoin has reached its previous ATHs. If you can afford it, I'd average all this out for that kind of hold, by purchasing more as it dips. A little now, a little later, and in the end, it will (hopefully) pay off while all those other people who pussied out are drooling over your lambo.
Ah also you haven't lost over $1k yet. It's only a loss if you sell. Keep your precious bags, the present price is just a technicality.

Try to view it not just as a currency, but also as a store of value. That's what it's fast become.
It should be compared to gold more than anything in my opinion.
Store of value. 
Hedge against inflation/economic crisis.
And sure, an alternate currency.
Bitcoin hasn't hit zero. Maybe it could, but I personally think someone will always pay &gt; 0 for it.
Gold has withstood a much longer test of time don't get me wrong, but both have many of the same reasons for valuation, even in terms of speculation. Joe is gonna buy/keep his gold nugget because he heard how much it's worth in the news lately. That example is being compounded the same way with bitcoin today. 
And knowing one can always point out that sheer energy/labor goes into the mining of a resource like gold, I'll just point out the electricity/hashpower necessary these days to mine reward blocks.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:20:38
Tough call without knowing the bottom.
Haven't thought about it much, but can the same idea of averaging out purchases over a dip be used to sell a little bit of your crypto at a time during the dip as well? It's essentially the same thing right assuming you really stick to your guns and buy back in around the bottom, and assuming it goes back up to a new high?
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:21:32
I have a question hopefully someone can answer.
Ever since my first purchase of bitcoin, I've traded it on exchanges for various other currencies that I thought had value and/or the possibility of higher returns than just leaving it in the form of BTC.
Is this a mistake? I've been doing pretty well even through all the latest swings. I know the bare minimum about trading pairs, but I figured I'm in the clear because of the sole reason that so much of the other (legit) coins rise and fall with BTC. 
So if I ever just want BTC back, ideally just cash out the currencies with the highest returns, and call it a done day? I get the feeling I'm missing something super important here, please enlighten me!
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:44:42

Is a successful fork only one that takes over the original's name?
Because I think a failed fork means it drops to zero and gets delisted virtually everywhere. Bitcoin cash is an alt in my opinion, but fork or not, it's still worth something. So is BTG I believe? My point is the incentive for anyone, even scam artists, to fork is there. And I think that's largely due to just how early the adoption of crypto is, coupled with speculation of both experienced and noob investors who just got more wealth out of thin air.
Not trying to be difficult, but I think the future is bleak if bitcoin forks remain unstoppable. I mean saturation is inevitable at some point.

Just to be clear, it doesn't "cost" an exchange or app company anything to provide the users their fair share, right? Outside of some extra time and effort, I mean.
They're just providing something that was already there and you'd automatically have if stored in your own wallet.
So what exactly was an entity like Coinbase trying to pull when they initially announced they'd have nothing to do with the Bitcoin Cash fork and advised everyone who wanted to be included to withdraw their bitcoin? Were they just planning to keep the assets of those users who failed to comply, and write it off with negligence?

Follow the part you said about leaving it.
Watching an asset all the time is what robs most people of their profits/leverage. Having multiple opportunities to exit for reason a, b, or c is going to cost you.
Not having a choice by locking away the key and ignoring it is what will get you the most money back. Compounded by the amount of time you can look away.
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:52:30
OP seems to be referring to the initial climb that broke through 3k, 4k, and hitting 5k. Not just the recent dip/correction.
I think it's simple demand coupled with more exposure. As more of the general population becomes aware of it, a percentage of them will explore how to actually acquire some. Coinbase accounts reflect this lately. This awareness will only increase over time, but guess what isn't increasing? The number of bitcoin. Holding is a good philosophy.

@_date: 2017-10-17 03:54:13
I used to think like that, but I'm not so sure it's so cut-and-dry.
You seem to acknowledge that you now are limiting yourself to 1 crypto that succeeds/fails. And while BTC is used for a lot of alt trading, you can tell with the changes in BTC price that it doesn't always correlate to a USD change for a given alt. In my opinion, if BTC didn't have the literal first mover advantage, it could easily be one of the many alt coins you see today. Which is why I think it's fine and smart to diversify a bit into alts, so long as you do your own research and find real use cases for the crypto to exist. If that condition is met, BTC isn't necessary for its survival. I have small bags of these, but coins like IOTA, BAT, and SYS immediately come to mind.
TL;DR don't recommend, too many eggs, not enough baskets.

I believe the rate at which newcomers are learning/opening coinbase accounts/demanding bitcoin outweighs the temporary effects of panic sales like what we experienced today. And last weekend.
As people have begun to note, whenever it dips, it recovers much quicker than before. My money's on 5000 again before we ever see 3000 again.

I agree, but in his defense he added that I do tend to buy a lot of weird shit. Which is true.

This. Combined with the inability (or refusal) to see that the current returns can easily be replicated in the next decade. The price looks high now, but will look like peanuts if/when bitcoin reaches 100,000 for 1 bitcoin.
