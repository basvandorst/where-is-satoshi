It very specifically breaks the third rule, "News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic." and the rule "Please avoid repetition " and "Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere." and maybe "Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted."

If the word bitcoin got so poisonous that people don't even want to associate their product with it just changing the name isn't going to help the reputation. Plus that is a thing multi level marketing and pyramid schemes do so it makes the reputation looks even worse to try this sort of "rebranding".
