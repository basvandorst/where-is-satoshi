Typical unhelpful /Bitcoin reply

Have you looked into bitconnect?

Try messaging u/mike-poloniex ... It took awhile but I got mine back. Be kind to them too :)

Just buy bitcoin instead, the people will eat that up more.

Is there a minimum you need as collateral?

Congratulations on your first BTC purchase! 
Make sure you save the private keys (passphrase) somewhere safe. I don't believe CoinBase gives these out, but for any type of offline wallet you'll set it up at the beginning.
Some folks are against keeping currency on an exchange, out of risk of hacks, short term it's usually harmless. The less you have to transfer it, the better, since fees are kinda high right now.

I can't read but I think what he said is good

Congrats! Just hold tight! Think of it more like gold, if gold prices slid 10% you probably wouldn't be happy but you'd still keep it because you know it's valuable and will fluctuate :)

Send them to me and I'll write you a poem with them

Great idea. Too bad Ver would look like a bumbling baffoon next to Andreas and would never agree to this out of fear that his scam will come to light. But, alas my upvote you shall have.
