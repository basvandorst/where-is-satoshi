It is certainly plausible to me that Bitcoin will become the world's store of value, and alt coins or perhaps an as-yet-unseen implementation of cryptocurrency will handle transactions and other associated uses we have for money.

Great for Bitcoin, but absolutely arbitrary, other than the numbers are around the same ballpark right now. The headlines for this news are limitless, a few years ago it could have been "Bitcoin exceeds the price of Gold (per gram)", in the future it will exceed the price per Kilogram. The market cap of gold is still 500 times higher than that of Bitcoin, one BTC needs to equal $500,000 per coin in order to "exceed" it.

Actually in the Cypherpunks mailing list discussion after the release of the Whitepaper, Satoshi admits sort of did it backwards, the whitepaper was done after he had already spent over 18 months coding it to see if it was actually possible. Like Nassim Taleb is fond of saying, in the real world things tend to go from Practice&gt;Theory rather than the other way around that school textbooks make it look like.

It's not the method of payment, it's the platform. As pointed to regarding Kickstarter, it all boils down to psychology more than it does technology. What Patreon does now, has been done long before with PayPal buttons, etc.

I'm an optimist and I never thought I'd see this!

It's not unacceptable, learn some basic free market economics. You can, and should, go to the 10's if not 100's of other options out there as a substitute for Coinbase. If you don't like their site, stop whining, run with your feet not your mouth.

Precisely, although obviously both cash and gold do have histories, they are just not recorded digitally thus mostly invisible.
