If we want to scare people away from Bitcoin, we should get this one on the air indd...
@_date: 2014-04-24 10:57:34
13 BTC is quite much... Irresponsible of the seller to leave that on there, even if he has access on other devices. Still, the right thing would be to make quite an effort in tracking him down, it's not like finding a $10 bill.
@_date: 2014-04-18 10:58:07
Everyone who means something in the world of Bitcoin will be there, it's gonna be great! I'm expecting at least three potential Satoshi Nakamotos there as well, start guessing people!
@_date: 2014-04-18 10:46:48
I may be wrong but wouldn't it be in the best interest of any politician to accept Bitcoin for his/her campaign? Money is money, no matter in what form...
@_date: 2014-03-27 11:20:35
I just laughed out loud after reading that. That joke wasn't even that good... What's wrong with me? :)
@_date: 2014-04-16 12:58:18
I often go to the moon in my dreams! I'm happy to see BTC go up to 500 dollars again in real life tho, 8000 USD seems a bit far-fetched for now :)
@_date: 2014-04-24 11:24:59
To be honest, no... Everything pointed in that direction (from the moment they asked for protection, everyone saw this coming tbh).
I wonder how long the trustee will be 'investigating'. Even though the court ruled now, people still know little to nothing about their stolen bitcoins. :/
@_date: 2014-04-24 09:19:25
True, I didn't think of that. Pornsites like to see people still paying them while they haven't visited that site in months... I guess it will be coming through a worldwide service soon, I can't imagine nobody developing such a crucial feature. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 16:22:48
I think Bitcoin is god's gift to the porn industry. No more worries about bank receipts, just anonymous spending. I'm surprised it hasn't been adopted on a massive scale yet. Chaturbate.com knows how this world works ;)
@_date: 2014-04-02 12:37:36
I haven't read anything positive regarding CryptoRush... The initial hack that started all this was surrounded by bad PR, it just keeps on going...
@_date: 2014-04-24 11:21:53
Hehe, this is a good one. Keep 'm coming man, this world needs more laughter :)
@_date: 2014-03-27 11:11:21
In his shoes, I'd doubt it as well probably. But considering how many people he has hurt with the whole Mt Gox thing, it's a slap in the face for a lot of them...
@_date: 2014-03-19 08:32:11
They're indeed going to accept international payments soon. How soon 'soon' is, remains to be seen ofc. It's a shame though, making Bitcoin bound to borders is exactly the opposite of what it stands for :/
@_date: 2014-04-02 12:51:54
Of course, they haven't banned it yet this week. I was wondering what was taking them so long.
@_date: 2014-04-18 10:55:01
Isn't that what Bitonic.nl also provides? 
@_date: 2014-04-28 22:29:51
Right now it's EU only, rest of the world will be available real soon though.
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:15:23
Great news, more and more big companies are getting into Bitcoin. I wonder what big names have joined by the end of 2014...
@_date: 2014-04-23 09:49:35
I wish someone would name me Satoshi Nakamoto :(
@_date: 2014-04-28 22:32:23
That would have made such a better title, where were you when I was writing that?
@_date: 2014-04-18 10:50:31
Oh great, that means China will ban Bitcoin again somewhere next week, can't wait!
@_date: 2014-04-28 08:19:13
It is possible to predict prices, but we can't predict the future. If another country decides to go all China on us, price will decline even further. If a big enterprise decides to accept BTC as a method of payment, we'll be on our way to the moon again.
As with everything, use your common sense when trading and bear in mind that BTC is volatile. Do not invest money you can't afford to lose and always follow "buy low, sell high" as your ground rule. In fact, don't trade too often. It's not what BTC was made for...
@_date: 2014-04-24 11:20:38
I wonder, is he going to give that woman from Newsweek (forgot her name) some of his BTC? Even though it was REALLY bad journalism, she caused his sudden fame :)
@_date: 2014-04-28 17:12:09
Only a matter of time before the famous Amsterdam red light district accepts Bitcoin on a mass-scale. Expect to see that headline in a few weeks :)
@_date: 2014-03-28 14:55:44
I'm guessing both were involved, China just a bit more than the US.
@_date: 2014-03-27 10:39:22
Oh Mark... Why are you such a douchebag?
@_date: 2014-04-25 12:35:47
Nobody in Belgium knows who or what Orillia is (I am fairly educated in Bitcoin, I live in Belgium, never even heard of it). I support these things, but Belgium needs a LOT more attention before things like this can be successful.
Looking forward to the way they'll market this. I hope it can make people in Belgium more aware of cryptocurrencies. We are nowhere near the awareness level of the Netherlands, even though that country is only a 30 mins drive for the most of us...
@_date: 2014-04-23 09:48:29
Seems only right for software like GIMP to accept Bitcoin. Wonder why it took them so long tbh
@_date: 2014-04-24 11:50:45
That's one pimp-ass sheik! Nice to see where their oil money goes to, I fully support this :P
@_date: 2014-04-24 09:07:32
I actually can't wait to see this one myself. Anyone have an idea when it will be released to the public?
@_date: 2014-04-24 11:53:30
I like it, good to get Bitcoin out there. It's free (are there any other free conferences?) and they give a basics crash-course before getting some nice speakers to the stage.
@_date: 2014-04-02 10:04:01
1 dogecoin for all!
@_date: 2014-04-24 14:18:30
This... Such an amount of money in so little time. This smelled fishy from the very start. 
@_date: 2014-04-24 11:29:20
As I said in another topic about this, how long will this trustee be 'investigating'? I'm guessing a pretty long time. People still have no clue whether there is any money left...
@_date: 2014-04-18 10:57:27
I was thinking the same thing, would be surprised if he shows up in Austria...
@_date: 2014-04-28 08:31:53
I'm not surprised, we're always 'late' when it comes to new technologies. I should be disappointed but I wasn't expecting anything else...
@_date: 2014-04-23 16:18:11
Nobody ever said the arrival of Wall Street has positive consequences only :)
@_date: 2014-04-30 09:26:01
It's good news though... In a struggle for acceptance, being mentioned in big blockbuster movies is quite a big deal. Learn to appreciate good news when it happens, it doesn't always have to be about sensationalist disaster reports.
Still found the gif funny, though ;)
@_date: 2014-04-02 11:33:43
Threatening his daughter is completely twisted and should NEVER be tolerated.
The situation Neo&amp;Bee finds itself in, is bad obviously... This hurts Bitcoin, again.
@_date: 2014-03-19 08:38:18
Possibly, depends on how long it will take for BTC to integrate with those. Bitcoinshop.us is on its way to getting investments. That means they're trying to expand their services. Check [here](
@_date: 2014-03-27 09:58:10
Yes, yes they do. It's their way of saying 'I love you'. Borderline officials, they push away what they like the most. Freud would have a good explanation for this!
@_date: 2014-04-24 11:27:49
And in another one as well iirc ;)
Ah well, I see tons of double threads move around daily tbh, it's the 'post to reddit' buttons on the websites. People post it without checking Reddit first... As long as it's newsworthy, I guess it doesn't harm anyone.
@_date: 2014-09-01 22:54:09
I agree with him actually... If you look at the interview, it shows a man who is a believer but who also tries to put everything in perspective. It's better to be realistic about things. 
I don't really buy the tx malleability bit though...
@_date: 2014-05-01 12:50:35
I was expecting that Karpeles topic in 10 months...
@_date: 2014-04-24 10:52:13
Well that was to be expected.. I'm predicting a long time now before the investigation is over and we'll learn what kind of reimbursement (if any) creditors will get.
@_date: 2014-04-02 11:14:04
Hmm, it sure smells like a very bad case to me. Perhaps I was too harsh in my title. The newspost puts a questionmark behind the article as well. Bottom line, it's not good.
@_date: 2014-04-30 09:27:30
Oh well, it had to happen sooner or later. Let's get it over with already, the weekly bans are getting tiresome.
@_date: 2014-04-22 07:15:45
Cash money fuels the same shitty things, even more. Nobody blames cash, but we do blame Bitcoin? The bad stuff happening is just human nature. There will always be douchebags that screw things up. No matter the circumstance... Bitcoin isn't guilty of anything.
@_date: 2014-04-25 07:31:11
Manipulation... I don't believe there are some big shots who want to profit when price goes down. They may have done that one or two times, not several times in just a few weeks.
My guess is the government is carefully trying to kill Bitcoin. Bringing bad news every few weeks so the volatility scares away many investors. It sucks but hey, it's China. They can't have anything that connects them to the world, what did you expect?
@_date: 2014-04-02 12:40:16
Well to be fair, the article only cites from Danny's own post. It never twists his words anywhere and also states that threats are just wrong.
But I agree with you, the threats are the real issue here. The authorities have been notified, there must be something they can do?
@_date: 2014-04-24 14:23:18
Hahaha omg, I've seen a lot of Gox jokes but this one is the best :D
@_date: 2014-03-27 09:51:50
$534, I woke up this morning thinking it was Friday. It was only Thursday. Fml, I'm going to be a pessimist all day!
@_date: 2014-03-27 09:55:02
My inside source tells me Obama is Satoshi Nakamoto! I'll be having an interview with Newsweek soon.
