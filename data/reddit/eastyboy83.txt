Im from the UK also and i use Coinbase. I find it easy to use and never had a problem.They do charge a fee on every purchase.I purchased a Trezor hardware wallet to store everything i buy.

Mate Bitcoins are priced at over £3300 who is going to just give away that kind of money to someone who's begging on Reddit?

After getting it sent to the UK with an android cable,VAT and Shipping it worked out at £121.Not cheap no.But it depends how much your going to be buying in the long run as you'd be gutted if your coins were stolen.It can work out a good investment in itself for piece of mind.

Its a small device that plugs into either your pc or mobile and you send your Bitcoin/Litecoin or Ethereum to it.That way your not keeping your coins on someone elses server where it could be hacked .
