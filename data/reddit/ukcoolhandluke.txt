It's my hedge ...

It would be awesome to see it as a burn address so people could at least see how many coins are (technically) lost.  Reducing the circulating supply more ...

Not true.  The bank pays you interest as a dividend for using your money.  My wallet sadly does not.

The price is the price, now I'm just looking forward to seeing more of these old memes

Wow, Cardiff leading the way!

Congrats ! Just to add to this slightly ....
Currently You are in the 17 million club as only 17 million exist at this point in time.... Feeling a little bit more special ? :p

Lol.  Yeah, as said, welcome to crypto.  It moves fast, it gambling on steroids.

Think its fair to say that the dates are wrong.  Reassuring non the less

First things first .... Mining bitcoin ? ASICS rule the bitcoin mining trade.  ETH - GPU's rule roost.  Most office PC's don't have GPU's so you have very limited options .... And a large power bill .....

0.1 is my current aim too.  Well done!

Same happened to me.  Basic verification failed. Enhanced did work, no reply from support ... Still waiting.

Don't rush it, give it time and play it smart.

This.  I would also scan your computer with multiple AV products.  They clearly have your password from somewhere - you need to find the source.  They may have access to you email, so check the logs.

True, but how successful will they be ? Most trade on bitcoins name.  Anything with good foundations will have its own identity.  If they do simply fork bitcoin they will fork at a given point and that's likely to be quite far along the chain.

Heard this advertised on the radio the other day, thanks for the reminder and the link.

I know we are preempting the news but I agree.  Most vulnerabilities will require physical access.  A Linux laptop is no better than a hardware wallet, even more vulnerable in the long run (you need to connect it to the web for updates, which it will need).
So if the physical access assumption is correct ... Who has access to your hardware wallet ? Still less vulnerable than a desktop pc.
