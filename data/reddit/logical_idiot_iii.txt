People with such mentality should be thrown in the hands of ISIS to defend themselves. No country to save your sorry asses from terror threats.

comparing percentages from past is oxymoronic. Right now a 70% decline is a super big deal because Bitcoin is big. No one would give a shit about a tom dick and harry coin of the past. But bitcoin of today cannot afford to go down.
