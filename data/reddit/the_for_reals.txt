"You must have a BS or higher in computer science, mathematics, or physics."
Ya, physics.

Primecoin doesn't use NSA developed algorithms. Does that make it safe from the NSA? It's easy to generate random numbers, and lets see them hack mathematics.

Sorry I don't understand, if China shuts down its mining pools then how is this relevant? If China doesn't shut down Bitcoin then what is with all the drama about China stopping Bitcoin?

Doesn't really matter if you are against S2X if you don't mine any blocks. [94% of blocks mined support S2X](

I think if you make a new wallet it creates a new privkey from your 24 word seed.

Could they block Bitcoin like they block Google from their internet? Are they already doing this or are they just trying to shut down miners?

So what are the signs it is a segwit block?

Just wait for other people to test it.

It is nice to know there is a way around the ban. We will probably need similar services in the future for Bitcoin.

Satoshi is the head of the snake.

Blocks are getting pretty close to full again even after segwit. Is there a better way to alleviate the pressure that could be implemented in a similar time-frame as S2X?

Satoshi made a mistake?  [The first BIP]( states "This particular design, created by Satoshi, suffers from a serious flaw related to duplicate entries." 
What are the exploits of this flaw?

But why should you have to make your own tags. Then you have to keep track of them yourself, which can be annoying and not secure.

Ok, so private keys start with a 5 if associated with an uncompressed address, and if they correspond with a compressed address they start with a 'L' or 'K'? Is the only difference between the private keys for an uncompressed address and its compressed version, the '5', 'L' or 'K' at the beginning of the private key? Are compressed addresses completely different from their uncompressed version? Sorry for all the questions.
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:13:00
bitcoin is just the start.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:30:21
good idea
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:33:18
So if i sent you 5 bitcoins in one transaction, each single bitcoin can be traced back to the block it was generated from?
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:30:03
Do u know how they are compressed? The compressed versions are a character longer lol. I'm just curious as to how and why they are compressed?
@_date: 2013-11-24 10:16:45
could u give me a link? I can't find one
