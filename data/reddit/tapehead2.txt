With the proposed future improvements to Bitcoin it would increase the speed and decrease the fees. Alternatively there are a variety of altcoins out there that may take its place as a future of currency.

Don't buy on coinbase, shitty ratio. Deposit 5k usd into your usd wallet on gdax. You'll get better rates and can decide whether or not to buy once the funds have been deposited (up to 7 days). Once you decide to buy, it'll be nearly instantaneous. Risky business, if you're not up for it, stay away.

To the best of my knowledge the fees are nominal for all of the cryptocurrencies aside from the Bitcoin

Highly likely to be true. The cost per transaction has ballooned with the exponential adoption. This is one of the major issues with bitcoin and its being addressed.

And exchange is a market of buyers and sellers. When a lot of people sell their Bitcoin all the people that have by orders on the market automatically or manually buy it. Losers are the people who bought the Bitcoin at a higher price and hold it while it falls in value. The winners are people who are able to sell it before the crash.
