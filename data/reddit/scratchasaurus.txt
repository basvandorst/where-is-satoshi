Like all keynesians he's been wrong about pretty much everything. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 01:18:12
He goes into more detail in the book. The point is that during the 19th century during the era of the gold standard and sound money, inventions were in the 0 to 1 kind. In essence groundbreaking and never before seen like the combustion engine, flight, modern medicine, electricity, telegraph, etc. Whereas in the 20th century during the era of fiat money, most inventions go from 1 to many. In essence taking these new inventions and adding to them, creating layers of complexity on top of them.
This if of course not a complete binary rule, but a lot more often than not this has been the case. It's also a hell of a lot easier to understand innovation that is completely new and groundbreaking as opposed to innovation that is layers and layers of complexity on top of each other.

If you consider fungability a binary, then it becomes a pretty useless term. Only gold in its pure atomic state would really qualify.
Cash, Monero, Lightning Network transactions and most real world gold usage can all be considered more or less fungible, but if one where to define fungability purely in binary terms none of them would qualify.

@_date: 2018-10-18 19:34:30
The supply is inflationary (untill 2140), as is gold and pretty much every other commodity. The value in terms of purchasing power for goods and services is historically deflationary. The latter is what is usually referenced when people talk about its deflationary properties.

“UASF was basically a way for the nodes to express themselves and say, ‘Miners, we only want these kinds of blocks, and if you don’t give us these kinds of blocks, your blocks will be rejected."
August 1: The day we remember that Method of Payment isn't the killer feature of Bitcoin.
Merchant adoption is expensive to subsidize. Getting people to hold is easier, but only if the asset is decentralized.
Today Bitcoiners celebrate their divorce from terrible ideas and unacceptable compromises. The market has validated this path for 2 years by nearly every conceivable metric. Bitcoin forks offering nearly free transactions struggle to find anyone who cares. Happy UASF day!
I am super-glad it happened. Bitcoin store of value confidence rose several orders of magnitude since Bitcoin withstood that test. (attempt of centralised governance (whether well meaning or not, however benign change - a change under those circumstances was an existential risk).

"Every other problem that bitcoin will have to overcome is more pedestrian relative to scarcity. Digital payments? The idea that human ingenuity can create digital scarcity but that we then cannot layer on payments technology does not logically follow. Payments technology is just one of the many 1 to n innovations that will be built on top of bitcoin to globalize its adoption. Not only are payments easier to solve, it is also not a critical path that needs solving today. The primary use case for bitcoin today is as a savings mechanism, not payments."

"Any and all concerns about the amount of energy bitcoin consumes or will consume is a red-herring. It is not that we should sacrifice electricity that could otherwise power homes; instead, it’s that we will never have the electricity to power those homes if we do not have a reliable monetary system to coordinate economic activity and marshal resources. In practice, bitcoin will not practically compete for the same energy resources that fuel the basic productive and consumptive functions of our economy (not zero sum); instead, bitcoin’s function as a currency system will ensure that those very energy needs can continue to be fulfilled."

"Because bitcoin has inherent and emergent monetary properties, it is distinct from all other digital monies. While the supply of bitcoin remains fixed and finitely scarce, central banks will be forced to expand the monetary base in order to sustain the legacy system. Bitcoin will become a more and more attractive option, as more market participants figure out that future rounds of quantitative easing are not just a central bank tool but a necessary function to sustain the alternate and inferior option. Before bitcoin, everyone was forced to opt in to this system by default. Now that bitcoin exists, there is a viable alternative. Each time the Fed returns with more quantitative easing to sustain the credit system, more and more individuals will discover that the monetary properties of bitcoin are vastly superior to the legacy system, whether the dollar, euro or yen. Is A better than B? That is the test. In the global competition for money, bitcoin has inherent monetary properties that the fiat monetary system lacks. Ultimately, bitcoin is backed by something, and it’s the only thing that backs any money: the credibility of its monetary properties."

An item made with gold can vary in purity, aesthetics, form and in other ways, but the gold itself can not. Melt it down and it is indistinguishable from other amounts of gold.
X BTC originates from specific addresses that is public on the blockchain along with its entire history. Any merchant or individual can create blacklists denying transactions from certain addresses. Miners can also create blacklists and refuse to include transaction from certain addresses into their blocks. If, for example, a specific address is associated with criminal behaviour, all Bitcoin sent from this address can be considered tainted and will be less valuable than other Bitcoin. This makes Bitcoin (on the base layer at least) not fungible, unlike gold, cash and Monero.
This has not been much of an issue so far, but analysing and snooping on the blockchain and tying individuals to addresses is being done on a large scale by businesses and by intelligence organisations. This is also why decentralisation of mining pools is very important for Bitcoin. Its not due to 51% attacks, but rather the possibility of political and financial pressure on pools to enact blacklists and whitelists.

There are many types of fear. Fear of losing control. Fear of losing respect. Fear of the world changing to something they don't understand. Fear of being marginalized, forgotten, sitting alone in their mansions and not being invited to news shows and the tables of decision makers.
Much like how Roger Ver wasted millions on trying to control Bitcoin because he wanted respect, popularity and control, these geriatric statists value their positions at the top and their belief that they are right and this is the way the world aught to be way more than their wealth.

These people have their wealth protected in stocks, real estate, etc and have often accumulated their wealth over a long period of time and taken precautions to protect both themselves, their families and their wealth. They are hard targets and rarely get targeted.
Then you have ordinary people who have for whatever reason decided to invest in Bitcoin. They might have them on an exchange, on a simple software wallet or a hardware wallet. The price increases and they suddenly experience great wealth and if they have been stupid enough to talk about having Bitcoin it means that their security is crap and bad people will notice and act. Unless you keep your Bitcoin in a combination of hardware wallet and a multisig solution or your private key is in a bankbox, you are a soft target and will be targeted.
