But how is it a dip when we're 300 lower now?
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:22:55
Well tbh my research was mainly just reading this sub. I kept on waiting for the right time to get in. I don't know why but that specific post made me go all in. I thought maybe that person was a investor or something. It seemed like knew what he was talking about. 
Maybe he actually does but he made a mistake. Which can happen. 
I'm not angry at him or anything. I realize it's my own responsibility. 
I will be more cautious in the future!

Easier said than done. 
I already sold 1/3 back with a big loss. These are my savings. I can't risk losing everything. If it keeps dropping i will be forced to sell the rest as well. 
I'm absolutely sick. It's ruining my life right now. 
I can't believe people even downvote me. I could use some support instead.

Hi, thanks for your reply. Yes i fully realize that now. I just thought people here know their stuff. I was really happy when i bought the dip because i thought it would just go up again. 
I'll discuss with my wife what to do. This is really a lot of money for me. For us. 
Thanks.

Yes, i fully realize this. I was too naive thinking people here what the price would do. I guess people saying to buy the dip did not buy any at these prices. I should not have listened. Totally my fault. 
Shouldn't the mods maybe remove those posts next time? I'm sure i'm not the only newbie who fell for it and now lost lots of money. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 11:50:31
So how much did you buy?
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:37:32
I'm so sick. I lost so much money. 
Why is this happening? Anybody knows? Will it go up again?
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:06:32
Fair enough. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:39:40
Please read my story. 
I lost lots of money because of a post like this. I think it's not fair to new people who might take the wrong advice. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:07:53
Thanks. Wise words. 
I was going to contact the person who posted the thread that made me buy. I was hoping he could advice me and maybe he knows if the price will go up again. But i'm not sure now. 
I'm not sure of anything anymore. I'm so stressed out. This money is so important to me :( i feel so stupid.

How would this change any of the things Ross was convicted for?
@_date: 2017-06-16 06:09:00
Thanks for kicking me while i'm on the ground already. 
Nice to know that the same sub who told me to buy is now calling me stupid. 
But don't worry. I will be gone already. My last post here. I sold everything to avoid even more losses. 
I learned a very expensive lesson. I'm absolutely gutted. Including all the fees i lost about 1/3 of my savings in 24 hours. Because of dissability i make very little money and this was a huge amount of money for me. 
You can make fun of me. It does not matter anymore. 
Bye. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:13:29
Right. I hope it will go up. I might sell 1/3 now. Just to make sure i won't lose too much savings! And then i wait to see if the price goes up. I really hope that it will!
Thanks. Appreciate all the advice!
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:59:02
Yes, i'm sorry. I should've known better. Expensive lesson. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:02:33
Yes i realize i've been stupid. I invested everything i had. For some reason i really thought it could not go wrong. 
I have serious thinking to do. I have to talk to my wife about what to do. Maybe the price will go up but for now i lost too much alreadt and maybe i should sell before it gets even worse. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:30:23
Of course i panicked. I still am. 
I don't know where this crash will stop. 1500. 1000? Do you?
Can you guarantee if i don't sell the price will go up again? 
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:38:23
Unregulated doesn't mean legal action can't be taken. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 14:24:58
How much did you buy?
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:27:14
Ok, i will sell half now before it goes down more. I feel so stupid right now. I worked so hard for this. But i can not risk losing even more. Thanks guys. I hope you understand.
