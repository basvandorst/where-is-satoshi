These words are almost never true. Maybe they are in this case. Let's see.  


Who is "we." And why should "we" tax? What moral imperative exists that says "we" should take money from some and give it to others? In my opinion, we have a moral imperative NOT to take money from people if they aren't willing to part with it.

This is very helpful for a non-tech savvy bitcoin hodler/user like me. However, there is one issue which I have been searching for an answer to that is not addressed here. That is: 
One of the main draws of bitcoin for me is its free market characteristics. I imagined when I first entered the scene that bitcoin would go wherever the market would take it (even if it meant a loss for me, which I am fine with). Now, I'm not so sure. Does one side claim to have the moral high ground on this issue? 
Note: when I say "free market," I mean it in the most free sense. As in no coercive authority dictating which direction the currency will go. Laissez-faire and all that. Anarchy. You get it.

There it is again. "We* do not collect taxes. Societies do not collect taxes. Only individuals do. And only individuals can pay taxes. When I accepted this as a fact is when I began to see the injustice of taxation that I had been taught to accept my whole life. 
It is not a conspiracy theory and I'm not some crazy Kaczynski. It's just that the idea of individual freedom has been forgotten and supplanted by collectivism for so long that ideas like humans ought to be able to keep the money they earn seems so 'out there.' 
Perhaps give it a thought is all I'm saying. Start small. Ask yourself if forced taxation would be just in a settlement with only two families. Then add a third and see if it changes anything. Work your way logically out from there.

Ok, I'm not saying she is correct in any way possible, but I do have a question that is along the lines of something she said.  
She is right that bitcoin is finite. Could someone help me understand why that couldn't *theoretically* be a problem. I know of bitcoin's extraordinary divisibility and how it will almost never be an issue practically. But why isn't it a correct theoretical argument to say that with a finite resource, it is possible for bitcoin to deflate so much that certain items on the market become priceless?  
Is it because the finite-ness can be undone with a mod to the software? (I am software/code illiterate).
@_date: 2017-02-27 00:25:26
Yeah...ok. But maybe leave the charged language out the next time a novice asks a question like this. All I'm saying is calling the other side "conspiracy theorists" (especially in the bitcoin community, c'mon) might actually make them *more* attractive to those just getting into alt-currencies.

I hesitate to engage with you further on an intellectual level. I am more than willing to have a respectful discussion, but your words are devolving into something other than this. Let me show you:


Let's break down your arguments here, one at a time. For reference [here is an argument pyramid](


This is a poor argument. So poor in fact that it doesn't even register on the pyramid. It's the equivalent of a 5-year-old saying NAH-AHH!


This is a non sequitur. Again, not even on the pyramid.


This is your first argument. Unfortunately, it is only a contradiction. This is not convincing.


You're regressing now. You've fallen to name-calling and further you are doing it to a strawman.  
Now, you may accuse me of cherry-picking, but I am going to choose what I believe to be the most coherent of your points and discuss them.


Obviously you are aware that I would disagree with your final two points here. We can perform a simple thought experiment so that I can attempt to prove my case. If an economy has a total money supply of $100 as well as 100 homogeneous goods each priced at $1, then each individual possessing $1 can purchase 1 unit of that good (to put it very simply). If the money supply is artificially, and secretly, increased to $200 (by printing, or counterfeiting), then the first person to receive the new money will still be able to purchase a good for the price of $1 (as the merchant is unaware of the printing of the new money). As time goes on and sellers realize there is an increase in the money supply, they will raise their prices. But the key thing is that those who receive the artificial money first have an advantage over those who receive it later (the Cantillon Effect). Also, this shows how monetary inflation *could* lead to price inflation, as the merchants will likely raise the price of the good to offset the loss of value the money has undergone.
I am aware this is an extremely simple example, but the core points to the argument are still there. Although you are correct when you say the government "targets" a particular rate of inflation and it is not a secret, they are talking about price inflation and is not germane to this particular argument. Also, I am aware that monetary inflation does not always lead to price inflation. If, in this scenario, a technology were produced which allowed the merchants to halve the price of the good, a doubling of the money supply would lead to no appreciable price movement (again, to put it very simply).  


First, the argument isn't over whether deaths in war are in decline (although it seems you are trying to take it in that direction). The argument is over whether war is good for humanity or not. And if it's not, should governments be able to easily start and sustain those wars. My contention is that war is not beneficial to humanity and it would be better if governments had less power to start and sustain them. Also, you brought up Gettysburg as the jumping off point, not me. You can't blame me for proving to you why you were wrong. Had you said since the 1950s (like the article that you linked said) instead of since Gettysburg, I wouldn't have been able to cite Hiroshima as a refutation.  
If that's not enough, I took a look at that link and found something else. The *Smithsonian* article links to a *Human Security Report* which links to the actual study which is said to corroborate these claims. From the *Human Security Report 2013's* abstract (bold emphasis mine):




This report is controversial to say the least so I don't think you can cite it as a knock-down argument for your side anyway. To the point about the twentieth century being the bloodiest in human history, it was also the century in which governments gained huge amounts of control of their country's money. 


1. I am aware that monetary inflation does not *always* lead to price inflation. I have never claimed that it did.
2. The idea is that, *ceteris paribus*, monetary inflation is detrimental. The absence of price inflation is not the only metric by which to measure economic progress. It could be possible that without QE, America would have seen price *deflation*, thereby increasing the standards of living of the masses (particularly the poor).

Thank you for your post. I don't know why you keep mentioning Libertarians and Libertarianism. We are discussing economics, and while politics and economics often overlap, I don't see how politics is relevant to this discussion. For the record, I am not a Libertarian. Just a layman economist having a friendly debate, that's all. Now... 


Regardless of the reasons you think some Libertarians will give regarding the badness of monetary inflation, I can assure you that the reason I think it is bad is not a circular argument. I think monetary inflation (such as what has been seen in Western monetary policies since the '08 recession) is bad because it is theft, first and foremost. It is artificially devaluing the purchasing power of those at the end of the money-getting line. This is known as the Cantillon Effect I think. It hurts the poor in particular and I think that knowingly producing this effect is immoral. 


I would disagree per my argument above. 


Right, but OP's point, and now mine, is that monetary inflation makes it *that much easier* for governments to fund wars. 


Maybe? Maybe humans killing each other is bad? From an economic standpoint, war is just about the worst thing humans can do if the goal is prosperity and higher standards of living. It is actually the direct opposite of raising standards of living. It is the business at becoming the most proficient at *killing*.


And maybe we should explore ways that we could make it just slightly more difficult for governments to wage war. One of those would be to limit monetary inflation. 


* Gettysburg ~ 7,000 dead 
* Hiroshima ~ 125,000 dead


You are talking about price inflation, which is fine, as you obviously see it as the more valuable metric. The issue is, you were debating OP's point, and now mine, which is monetary inflation is bad. I'm not sure you've given a counterargument to this, other than to attack Libertarians (which, like I said, I don't quite understand). 


Monetary inflation, AKA counterfeiting, is *never* good for the economy (I'm pretty sure this is right, but I honestly have not read quite enough to stake much on this claim. I probably shouldn't say never then, and I *definitely* should not italicize it). 


Yes, we will get to it, however, I would disagree that not being subject to something automatically renders an opinion on that something moot. I do not live in the Philippines, yet I can still have an opinion on Duterte's policies, no? 


Is this true? I can check my balance right now and be assured that my protective measures are sufficient. 


Why would you assume I haven't taken this risk into account? I can assure you I have and I can further assure you that a potential leg-breaker would not meet with success (as my cold-storaged bitcoin is not collocated in my residence). 
Even more, this risk is the same risk I take when I keep anything of value in my house. I would argue that bitcoin possesses *less* risk in this scenario than other high-value items that I own due again to its anonymity and its being digital. Other items like expensive electronics, automobiles, jewelry, etc. are all easily seen existing at my house from the thief's perspective. How could he possibly know I have bitcoin? 


If your argument is that banks are immune to robberies, then I would disagree. And if your argument is that bank deposits are covered by insurance, then so too can my bitcoin be. 


As I said, semantics. If my Apple shares go through the roof while the purchasing power of the dollar goes through the basement, my investment in Apple is not to blame for my real-world poverty. It is my investment in dollars. Had I purchased Apple shares in bitcoin (were it possible), my actual wealth would be higher due to its anti-inflationary characteristics. 


Are you saying that there is no such thing as real productivity, absent price inflation? Could a company not develop cost-saving technologies and increase the overall wealth of the world? 


I did it. It was easy. I made it easy on purpose. $1, with a 500% ROI yields $5. $1, denominated in 1917 gold, would yield ~ $53.04. I am not arguing gold vs. the stock market. I am arguing the dollar (a good subject to counterfeit and inflation) vs. gold (a good with a greater natural defense to both). By extension bitcoin, with its gold-like properties is also potentially a safer hedge against inflation (OP's original point).


You did not like my example, so you substituted your own and then argued against it. You can do that, but it does not help. 


It is true and it's also true of bitcoin (regardless of what it is denominated in). 


The argument isn't necessarily that bitcoin's price in fiat will always be a certain number; the argument is that bitcoin's *value* will hold better than fiat. This is OP's, and now my, original point. He ceased holding fiat as a store of value because it is not a very good one. Bitcoin on the other hand is. 


Hopefully we can move past this non sequitur and continue a fruitful discussion.

No problem at all. I appreciated your answer all the same. 
HOWEVER! I am one of those looney tunes who doesn't think a deflationary currency is bad. In fact, I think it as very good. You see, Murray Rothbard is my man, and as much as all of my professors wanted me to get behind Keynes and the bunch, I never could.
Hail gold! 
Hail bitcoin! 
Have a good day! 
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:24:30
I'm going to attempt a layman's rebuttal to your post here. Check it out:  




That's directly from the FRB and the italicized portion (my emphasis) is what makes your point miss. You see, OP wasn't talking about price inflation (I think), he was talking about monetary inflation, two entirely different things.  


By artificially increasing the money supply (i.e., inflation), the US Government is able to fund wars with this new "money." You are welcome to debate the fact of whether or not the USG actually artificially increases the money supply. You are equally welcome to debate the meaning of the word "inflation," but OP's point stands, as monetary inflation is a tool used to pay government expenditures (including war).  


A government that takes out a loan is not always a government that inflates its monetary supply. These are mutually exclusive policies. I don't know what you mean by inflation being a "hard problem," but I agree it is a problem. A problem which is purposely foisted upon the country's citizenry. Trust me, I don't like it. (Again, I am talking about monetary inflation. Whether or not price inflation is a result of this is dictated by a number of forces and shouldn't, in my opinion, be used as an important measure for policy).  


"A lot" is a subjective measure. I own, by my definition, a lot of bitcoin wealth. Protecting it, at least for me, is not a full time job. The reason it is not is due to many advantages bitcoin has over, say, gold. To whit, it is anonymous and it is digital. Protection of my wealth in bitcoin is very easy, in fact. This is not to say that banks, including bitcoin banks, do not serve a purpose, because they do. But your use of the words "a lot," "protecting," and "literal full time job" are misleading.  


I don't want to put words into OP's mouth, but I believe this is an argument in semantics. For instance, if I purchase a share of Apple stock using American dollars, I could still be said to be "investing" in the dollar. That is, I believe that not only will the number of dollars that I have at the end of my investment be higher, but those dollars will also be able to purchase a greater stock of goods than previously capable. A 1917 investment of $1 in stock X which sees a 500% ROI by 2017 has *lost* wealth, because his "investment in the dollar" was ill-founded. Had he instead invested in gold with that same dollar, he would have gained wealth. I believe it is this kind of investment into the dollar with which OP is concerned.  


There is no conflation here. The media of exchange which is chosen to undergo an investment is just as important as the investment itself. Doubly so if a third party has a history of artificially lowering the value of that media without your consent or your ability to stop it.  


This is correct. In bitcoin world, theft and attempted theft will still be realities of life. However, it is likely that it will also be more difficult to accomplish, especially systematically.  


You are correct, it's not much more complicated than that. However, you are still talking about price inflation, which is not the most important measure of a soundness of a particular money. Also, it is unlikely that bitcoin will ever experience price inflation as compared to goods such as government currencies have historically seen.  
And there it is. I hope you liked it!

I have saved a portion of my income for some time now in an effort to prepare for my future. Due to monetary inflation, the purchasing power of my saved money will decrease over time. I characterize an unwanted decrease in my wealth, which is affected against my will, to be theft. As such, I believe I do have a case to have a valid opinion.  


Ok. I have.  


Someone who is more knowledgable than me may be able to correct this if it is wrong, but I think one can diversify their bitcoin wealth across multiple private keys, rendering your point incorrect. One could even possess bitcoin in locations unkown to the user with their actual possession contingent on some external event (like in a will for instance).  


Ok. I don't.  


This begins as name-calling, transitions into a non-sequitur, then ends with an unbacked counterargument. "Bitcoin's [sic] will necessarily have more friction to insure," is just like, your opinion, man.  


I don't need to propose an alternative bet because I have already insured my wealth in bitcoin. And it wasn't difficult.  


House insurance? Rental Insurance? If one can prove wealth was destroyed under an insurable claim, then why wouldn't he receive the commensurate payout? Just because most people use banks instead of going this route with their cash doesn't mean it is impossible.  


This is a very poor argument. I guess you have conceded the point.  




In fact, it is a direct refutation (using Socratic questioning) of when you said, "Without inflation, Apple's stock would probably be worth the same less the inflation." The refutation is that, absent inflation, Apple's stock would probably **not** be worth the same, it would probably increase, due to technological advancements. Our discussions would likely be more fruitful if you spent less time thinking I'm an idiot.  


You do understand that this statement of yours helps to prove my point? Why is it that "no one is going to hold a dollar bill for 100 years"? Here's another small hypothetical to demonstrate how I see it: Assuming a perfect lender/borrower relationship where both sides follow through 100% with their side of the deal, very few would lend dollars at a term of 50 years with a guaranteed payout of 500% at the end of the term. That is, a $1,000 dollar loan in 2017 would pay $5,000 in 2067. I know I wouldn't do it because I think that a 500% ROY at a term of 50 years will not keep up with inflation.  
**HOWEVER**  
I would *absolutely* lend one bitcoin on the same terms. One bitcoin from my pocket now in exchange for five bitcoins in my children's pockets in fifty years? In a heartbeat. Every time. Why is this? It is because I think OP is correct. Dollars lose value over time due to monetary expansion whereas bitcoin will likely gain value over time due to its resistance to the same. In fact, I am currently keeping bitcoin "under my mattress" while I must be much more proactive with my dollars. This is because if I just let my dollars sit, they will lose value. This is not some inherent bug or feature in the nature of green paper, it is a direct result of monetary policies.  


Yes, only a crazy person would assume that money once earned ought to hold its value under normal circumstances. This is what is so revolutionary about bitcoin. Under normal circumstances, bitcoin will retain its value while the dollar will not. It is in this light that "investing" in bitcoin is more prudent than "investing" in the dollar.  


You keep saying I didn't do the math. I presented an exceedingly simple hypothetical. I did the math on that hypothetical in my head. You can argue that my math was incorrect, but you cannot say I didn't do it. Well, I guess you could, which is turning into your M.O., but it is not a very good argument.  


Your argument here is again very poor. Ad hominem attacks only go so far in life. You asked me above how old I am. I can assure you I am old enough to not be swayed by juvenille tactics such as these. Also, I didn't say that Apple stocks would "appreciate faster if denominated in Bitcoin." I said that using bitcoin as an investment vehicle vs dollars in order to buy Apple stocks will yield more wealth for the future. These are different arguments.  
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:26:03




Ok. I do.  


Ok. I'm here to practice. I'm here in r/bitcoin because I am interested in the topic.  


Ok. I don't believe this. I think bitcoin has a huge up-side, but I also think it has the potential to fail. As for volatility, I don't really have a belief about that.  


If my math is correct, bitcoin has gone from being worth $0 to being worth...IDK what it is right now $1200? I don't think my definition for "good store of value" is the same as yours. "Ups and downs" mean nothing. Value at the time of purchase and value at the time of sale are the only two relevant values when talking about a store of value.  


Is it equally idiotic to invest, according to your definition, in companies with the denomination being fiat? If not, why not?  


I don't think the point of transitioning to bitcoin is to "make your money worth less." In fact, I know that OP's point is that by doing so he thinks he will be doing the opposite. Your simply claiming it to be otherwise does not make it otherwise. You must provide reasons why your point is correct or else you run the risk of being forgotten.  


Bitcoin is not just another segment of the economy. It is its own economy. It is *competing* against the dollar, not cooperating with it. There is no irony here. OP has chosen a side in the battle and provided reasons for his choice. Your response is that there is no battle. My response to that: Ok.  


Yes, that would be one way to hurt the overall economy. However, I don't think the point of OP's post was to "stick it to the big cheese." I think the point was to argue that one could retain one's earned wealth more efficiently by choosing to own it in bitcoin instead of dollars.  




You are welcome to bring up whatever you would like, but I think it hurts your credibility (and the discussion as a whole) if you continue to introduce ideas that have little to do with the topics at hand.
