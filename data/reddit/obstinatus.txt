Technical impossibility aside this is just poor monetary policy. Your suggestion seems to be trying to solve something that isnt a problem. Miners current incentive is the diminishing block reward not mining fees. If low miner fees were a problem right now we would be seeing a drop in hashing power but we are seeing the opposite. Which implies miners are confident enough in rising prices that they are investing more money in mining.

Every morning regular as clockwork. My point is consumer protection is often used as a smoke screen for state protection of entrenched business. Ultimately stopping innovation and market shake ups that could improve lives of citizens. Check out the history of automobiles in the UK for a good example. Anytime someone starts shouting about safety check who is lining their pockets.

I see your point but the way I look at it is that value hasn't been lost just redistributed to those still in control of their keys via the increased scarcity of BTC.

Do you have any examples of other markets where this uncertainty has negatively impacted the value of a commodity or service?

You just described the Guagua in Santo Domingo. No app just a bunch of people with busted up cars moving people around the city cheaply using only hand signals and cash.  But you aren't wrong. in1st world countries the motivation isn't function it is taxes, license fees, and protection of entrenched businesses under the guise of safety and protection from your own choices.

Essentially you are paying for big USB enclosure in the shape of a poorly 3d printed coin. Not ideal. Also the fact that you've got it in something that is obviously for bitcoin it makes it less secure. Back to the drawing board with you!

Check out what Katrina and LTB coin are doing with counterparty ( It's crowdfunding + I think offers the bonuses of investors and crowd-funding combined.
This way if it takes off and an investor wants none of it they can sell off their tokens for BTC, Cash, or trade it for physical goods. Or if they become hyper fans they can spend those tokens with you for awesome stuff. Think props from the set, being able to be an extra on the show, meet the cast, etc.
The concept is experimental but I think it works better then messing with escrow, managing investors, etc. It is also cutting edge decentralization which fits with what you are trying to do.

Your point is valid but an unbreakable contract is an unreasonable expectation in any scenerio. No contract is "unbreakable" just more costly to break than to complete.
So lets not raise the bar beyond what is currently possible until we can make contracts without third parties, easy, secure, and common place.

This does seriously impact BTC. Imagine if this BS actually stands. This means the Fed can require any software developer to give them the keys to any wallet. This puts our BTC directly in their hands. Eeek!

If Ethereum can't roll with sidechains then it deserves to die.
Remember this market currently is a free one and may the best crypto win!
And I own some aether!

I love it! Why not make a single device and make more them to reduce costs? Then we have the option of buying two and turning off the options that make it a hot wallet and essentially turn it into cold storage.
Just a thought. Your way may be way more cost effective.

With a currency that is generally expected to rise in value over time retailers must offer more than 10 to 20 percent to encourage people to part with their BTC. The promos were also lacking or behind a "just give me you email address and you can see all the deals" wall. Frankly retailers have to step up their game.
Everyone is too used to how easy it is to get consumers to part with their fiat.

From an I wish it were so I'd agree with you mate but an anonymous decentralized solution would never meet KYC rules and would make the initial use case that the creators are developing for impossible for banks and credit card companies to adopt.

Fantastic pic! I am one of the 60+ Driveshare alpha testers so I do have skin in the game so take my views with a grain of salt.
I completely agree Storj could be a game changer but it alone will not be a dropbox killer. An app using Storj could be a cloud storage killer.
Ultimately Storj will be the bed rock of multiple decentralized applications. Hopefully Maidsafe will use it to reduce their emplimentation time. Completely decentralized file sharing, websites, applications, pretty much anything could use storj.
To the traditionalists if current cloud services are by default more superior explain why bitorrent is still faster than any cloud storage solutions. As to the churn that is reduced by the monetization using storjcoin. Drive share users are encouraged to upgrade their hardware and to keep sharing by the people who are paying to use the service.
The biggest risk I see for Storj is its dependence on The bitcoin blockchain and its slow block confirmation time. But that risk has already been addressed, I believe, by early statements by the Storj team not ruling out going to a custom coin of their own if they run into any issues.

Full disclosure I own SJCX, have been a tester since round A, and believe in the project. I invested a little during the crowd funding phase but no more than was comfortable losing. I would say the big risk is losing the 8.8k investment and it becoming a irrational reason to sink additional money, resources, or time into the project if it starts to tank. I have seen the founder of Storj discourage people from investing money in hardware. That being said I did drop about 300 additional bucks in hardware just for testing purposes. But that is a far cry from 8.8k.
I suggest your friend get on the storj-community slack channel and ask the room what they think.
@_date: 2015-05-20 12:35:04
This whole thing is probably my fault. I asked before test group A if I could buy additional SJCX to hit the 10000 requirement as I wanted to assist with testing group A.
I don't see this one as a ponsi just a bunch of nerds working on a project that excites them. They can't just open test group B to everyone when it was a reward for participating in the crowd fund.

Oh mate don't say never. If you could further the cause by apearing on the Factor I'd say go for it. Even if he's a vile human being.

Just market manipulators looking to get a spike in Ether price. I say let those easily scared rush off to Ethereum they will just increase ethers volatility causing longer term stability to the price of BTC.
Full disclosure I have both Ether and BTC and think the world is big enough for many crypto solutions.

Stop treating coinbase as a wallet. It is just an on ramp to go in and out of bitcoin. Never keep your bitcoin on an wallet you don't have complete control over.
I keep no funds on Coinbase longer than a couple of minutes and they have never requested additional personal information from me. As soon as my buys clear I transfer to my hot wallet then into cold storage.
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:57:43
Yay for tipping Tuesday!

Remember who these guys primary customers are. It isn't us. It is people who are so afraid of volatility that they require a service like this. The this might not be around pitch only works for skeptical traditional investors looking to get into the BTC game without much risk.

I'm not super enthused about any of the entry points to Bitcoin becoming a bank. This could incentivize businesses like Coinbase to kill Bitcoin.
