The banner at the top has 3 options (on the left): Exchange, Margin Trading, &amp; Lending
If you put collateral in your Margin Trading balance you can short

Do you understand what a real crypto exchange is? Not talking coinbase here
Because all of them do. Bitfinex, BTER, Poloniex, Kraken....

And there is my confirmation. I guess I should also say that the .1 BTC you bought at $4500 won't buy you much margin anyways, but good luck kiddo

There is no trick. If you can design a novel algo you may be able to beat the market. Anyone else who says they've done great day trading is just lucky. You're best off just buying and holding or shorting, depending on your macro analysis

Oh in that case my mistake, you're clearly an adult with a life outside of reddit

Eh don't believe everything you read! If he had a tested and true system, he'd be a millionaire. You can definitely do your analysis &amp; due diligence, but even people who have been in this space for many many years still can't often point to price moves
Not to say you shouldn't at least try out some trading with an amount you're willing to lose. Just saying there is no secret sauce :)

Meant GDAX. Amazes me how many people ask questions here that would be so easily answered with a 3 word google search. But probably good y'all aren't smart enough to even get to margin trading

Definitely post about it when you do. Thank you for this post. Get sick of every post on here about "I bought at XXXXX now I'm laughing/crying"
