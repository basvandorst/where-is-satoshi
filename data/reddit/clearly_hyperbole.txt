Buying and holding applies to a balanced portfolio but not individual stocks? A portfolio is actually composed of a number of individual stocks, so your comment doesn't really make any sense.

I like it because it works decent enough, and that one day it may operate as a parallel to the main stream financial industry. The transaction cost doesn't really enter into that value.

I think you misunderstand how I'm using value in this context. Not monetary, philosophical. But to your point, look at the percentage of the population carrying a balance every month on their credit card and incurring interest charges. Not to mention credit card companies already charge merchants a transaction fee to use their network.^^1 Your view that everything "is all in the name of profits" is pretty narrow minded and doesn't really hold up when you look at the spending habits of society as a whole.

Same type of person who thought 1 btc would never be worth $10k 5 years ago.

I don't have a problem with paying some taxes to support the mentally/physically disabled, or provide for general infrastructure (nevermind most to all of this is subcontracted to private firms because the gov't is too inefficient to accomplish it themselves.) The tax the gov't expects is disproportionate to the benefit they provide. The amount of people in this thread crying out for people to fork over all they can to this tyranny is abjectly sickening.

Just give it some time brother. How much time, I'm not sure. But it's still just the beginning.

Lmao, turn the argument to support your points. Classic misdirection.
Here's you: Let me ignore the words and implications of the person I'm talking to and instead respond with my third-world sob story about how the gov't needs every dime they can get.

I work. The government taxes the company I work for, on the value I create. The company pays me, the government taxes them again. I get taxed on the money I receive from my labor. When I spend the money, I get taxed yet again. If I buy something of actual value, I get to pay rent to the government each year in the form of property tax.
You lead a very sheltered life if none of that bothers you. Consider yourself fortunate.

Don't think speculative trading really qualifies as supporting the network. Unless you're referring exclusively to mining, in which case I agree..

It’s a currency in the respect you can buy things with it. If you’re asking is it a Fiat currency, ex. the official currency of a country used for generally everything, that’s obviously not the case.
If I came to you with an ounce of gold and wanted to buy your iPhone, you should probably make that trade. Bitcoin is the same in that it is a medium of exchange.
Personally, I wouldn’t call bitcoin a currency yet. However, in the future it could very well become the currency of the Internet. How does that fit in to your webster’s definition of the word?
@_date: 2018-06-02 22:31:59
Yes, they sure are. And it's a good point; if there wasn't a financial incentive, I doubt bitcoin would have evolved to be as strong as it is today.

Will you link/pm a source for reading about this theory?

This is an excellent reply, I will be referring to this as a resource over the next few days. After reading the thought experiment, it all starts to make sense. I knew there was something there, but I had difficulty getting a handle on it. The Gardner hype cycle is cheerfully accurate as well. Thank you
