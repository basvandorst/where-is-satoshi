I've lost lots of wallets and welped just under 20,000ish coins total that I can remember just trying random shit from early.

I lost more than a few wallets with a "bunch" back from the beginning and sold off like 25 btc a while ago for a few hundred from a later mine so.... probably a ton.
A bunch back then was thousands of coins, wasn't really a big deal. Like I could have maybe bought a pizza like the one other guy on the forums but w/e it was just a cool experiment.

Hindsight 20/20, people get greedy and do dumb stuff and regret it later. I personally wouldn't advise people to touch exchanges until they're regulated and insured though. BTC is BTC and that's whatever, and has no relation to JPY, USD, or anything else.
Ideally though there would be a new crypto amalgamated from the advances other coins have made while being supported and regulated by the Americas and EU.

You know what? You're completely correct. Go hog wild. It's simple and easy to conceal the source of coins with minimal effort.
@_date: 2014-04-04 14:26:48
There's a big problem though you skirting with why BTC will only be a minor in the long game of crypto.
Early miners, and the coders hold coin. A lot of coin. This is great for getting them some value and cashing out on the idea. this takes the commodity value route. (Like gold) People likely won't trade in BTC widely, but you'll find people who will here and there. Hey, it's an investment.
But realistically, you have a deflationary situation where it's better to **hold long** (like with most good investments) than it is to spend, which is not something you want in a currency, especially with a growing population. Without a decent flow of coins coming eventually, BTC will never really take off as a currency, and will be relegated to a 2nd rate commodity like gold/silver. Which is decent I guess, for an investment. :/

Oh no, it's entirely possible, given certain conditions. Namely receiving coins from somewhere besides an exchange, and making sure the person you got them from can't compromise you (bartering them for example, make sure they don't know your name, give them some sort of untraceable service) to pay for some service that never hits your address? Yeah, pretty much untraceable!

Because if you're looking at doing any serious trading or investing, you realistically could make that back provided you don't need to live on what you're earning. Heck, 10k rolling some forex as a hobby could do it in a realistic amount of time assuming you got a few years and will/ability not to touch it while you're nursing it back to health, dead serious.
That and money is nothing to kill yourself over. Ever. I've been to the bottom, it gets better, you recoup, recover, and make yourself again. Even if you never have that amount again, think of your wife. How would that feel? Just to walk in on your spouse or best friend, dead, over *money* that apparently means more to them than you did.

That won't help if anything is delivered to your house by someone who reports your address anywhere. They could easily hand over txid and addresses to someone (not necessarily state) and have a whole history of any transactions made related to the wallet.

1. Forex: 
    
       Being good isn't about getting a few good large trades, it's predictably, and consistantly not losing money. Which is really unfortunate because it leads to the next bit.
2. BTC:
       As you should have learned trading on the exchange, a long position this far out is incredibly dangerous to take, doubly more so not cutting losses at 3% and watching the market from there. I can't even fathom how gambers like you can lose a (somewhat decent) bankroll, and immediately think "Nah, I'll drop another hundred grand, *this* time the market will defy the charts".
Digital currency is a cool thing, but you should have recognized the price bubble for what it was. If you had a proper stop set, you could have saved yourself a whole lot of misery, and gone back to learning how to trade more stable currencies while personally holding some BTC (not as some snake oil investment).

As someone who just help migrate a 20k employee location's state taxes, I kind of doubt many larger places will do this for another good 30 years, *if* it catches on at all.
Hell, they still print checks for 5% of their employees, and the amount of work in a single payroll process is enormous. That's twice a month, if they even needed process the last day (never mind staying late to process current day), they'd riot. Not to mention daily manager approval, and the two step above that for some of the exempts.
It's almost like you've never done work for a real business' payroll division.

Not easily, but with some sophisticated work, yeah, you'll be able to trace the origin of the coins and correlate where they're held, make one tx from that new address and it'll show up that tx1's coins are coming out of tx2, make a link and bundle them. You'd have to keep separate wallets with different addresses with separately bought coins which would be rather a lot to go through for any minor purchases.
Then again, money laundering (technically what is being considered, concealing the source of it) never was supposed to be easy.
Essentially the security of BTC makes it insanely easy to trace if any major (or some minor) vendors break down and start 
selling transaction information. Which because money is likely to happen at some point. People love money.
Also unconsidered would be a honeypot style operations where a store is only operating (possibly at a loss) for the purpose of building such a database.
The only way to "safely" conceal BTC would be keeping the acquisition, and spending online only. Technically IP *could* link you, but as long as your actual name or address aren't tied to it, you should be safe. The IRS can be picky, but they won't check to see if you bought a fursuit in secondlife with BTC with an audit. Which you likely won't get if you're never reporting BTC gains or losses and are a normal person who doesn't itemize.

I don't know about that, with the relative comparison of M2 to MB and the fact that the "leading" contender packs a whopping 10 transactions per second and is "backed by math", as opposed to economic power means that whatever "takes over" is going to need to be quite a bit different than the current bitscoin.
btcs could kind of take a back seat as with money transfers between institutions, but compared to major digital processors today it's 10 (paypal), and 200 (Visa/MC) times too slow to keep up. That's not even counting M0 transactions.
And oh boy, if you want to be the base currency for *the world*, but can't keep up with the M0 on a single ny city block.... well.... yeah. There's work to be done.
But as it stands, it lets me buy shit pseudoanonymously online so that's cool.

That's nothing, I've got a ton of coins sitting around on some micro sd.... somewhere from back when mining 100 btc in a day on a laptop wasn't really unreasonable, then some 25 lost to a usb drive that crashed and I tossed.
Coins didn't really have any value at the time, the most anyone had bought with them was a pizza. Was (and still am honestly) more upset about losing my 500 hour monster hunter save I hd backed up on that microsd.

Ahhhh, yeh, great idea, and when I mined my coins (before asics were even a thing) I couldn't see the issues on the horizon, but I still think it'll be another few iterations to really come to be a true global secondary currency in its own right.... because as great as the idea and tech is, there's no easy+secure use to common users without a couple of layers of abstraction from actual btc (the security issue is huge for people who overestimate normal users) not to mention the energy waste (while potentially minimizeable to areas where heat are needed) is way more than a database should be utilizing at it's size+activity without even considering adoption on the scale of mc/visa while supporting the forex guys at the same time.
Well, that and the issue of lost coins (oh man that micro sd that had monhun on it too had a nice house on it at the current price where I was fooling around with spare coins) what with how reclamation and the implications that would mean going forward once people are reliably doing so with old addresses.
I think crypto has a place, but it'll be with a fresh (mined coins) start when it happens on a more iterated technology, probably with a higher integer ceiling, because even now with low adoption we're hitting really weird levels of fractional spending, where I originally would have been happy with btc being somewhere between USD/JPY (5k btc pizza heyo) but even at the currently low adoption level we're threatening the satoshi, which is around 150/USD cent. And that's just, i can't even. We're near the point of breaking the base unit of the currency and it's still in the hipster speculative/adoption stage.

I mean, I know I got some in 2012 (a veritable fuckton bow I guess lol) but most people bought in at the highs 2016 on, and it's hard to predict just how low or high it will go.
I still think $1 == 1BTC is about as far as it should have gone. But I'm okay with 5000BTC pizzas as well back when mining was super fast and the whole thing was just a funny fad to play with some technology.

Generally once or twice to make sure it's actually me. But yeah, it's nice, efficient, and the entire process (call included) takes place faster than any transaction I've done in BTC can confirm.
Trying to be any sort of replacement for the internal metrics and ledger done by MC/Visa would be a pretty shitty implementation of BTC/blockchain tech IMO. Long confirmation times(even with a decent fee, more than the merchant pays it's still /slow as balls/), and irreversible transactions. Great for sending money to other people who know how to use it though. If they don't already know how, they might be better off using WU though.

If the card is run in another state or on another site I don't use often I get a call. Their metrics are actually pretty good, and when I pull out the wrong visa in Dallas, or Oklahoma; I sure as hell get a call to verify that it was in fact me buying $260 at X restaurant, or buying $2 of stuff at Y gas station.
The amount doesn't matter, if it's out of the norm I get a ring.
Also, small amounts 1-5USD amounts are most commonly associated with theft to make sure the card is good. Clearly this is an area you aren't too strong in.

@_date: 2015-07-30 06:31:54
Not really. They, like all banks, invest a large portion of their holdings keeping only a portion on hand. Through this method they are able to make money via investment and provide incentives (services for account holders in this case). They aren't charging anyone, they're investing your money while they have it, and building out systems with it.

Functionally, fractional reserve banking (aka just banking to most people) operates just fine. In fact, it's kind of a big deal when a bank leans on the fed for loans in a meaningful way.
OTOH, the lack of a central monetary authority (as bitcoin is a finite recourse) would perhaps expose conventional finances to undue strains because of some of the constraints. We'd all go back to hiding our money in funny electronic devices under our bed or something.

So invest in pancakes? (Or healthcare, that's a grower)
Don't keep money in USD, or BTC. Using either as a savings vehicle is rather ignorant of how money and markets work. If you're holding a currency, expect it's value to slowly drop. This is what drives investment in (even low risk) areas. You gain some value for little to no risk, while the "sure thing" of holding currency (USD or BTC) are likely to (outside of bubbles) increase in value just by holding it.
It's a key function of driving economic growth.

Bitcon's abysmal txrate compared to just about anything else does that. Might be faster than western union, but it's literally faster to sell a few shares of stock, transfer them to my account (both on my phone) and spend with my card than it is for a single transaction of groceries or coffee.

I'm so sorry, makes the 25 coins I lost at gox seem not so bad. I think I only have a few dozen coins left on a microsd that I used for my psp games back in the day, but I haven't seen that card for ages.... Funny thing is at the time I was more upset at losing my monster hunter save data than having to restart mining. otoh, at least I never used fiat to buy, just mined them myself back in the day when asics weren't really the thing.
@_date: 2018-07-07 09:47:23
Should have mined back when it came out, shitty laptop pulled 50 coins no problem in a day playing with it. faucets gave a ton then too.... But this is before it had any actual value, so any coins I have/had/will have ever had have a cost basis of $0.

Is the problem.. It's inefficient, so terrible for high IO transaction systems where you'd usually use another more efficient DBS.

I actually searched pretty well when I lost it because it had some PSP backups which I really missed (there wasn't even really any sort of value on BTC at this point, it was just a cool thing I decided to check out, I think a guy had bought a pizza, and another had traded a ton for a drink at a convenience store....). I mean, I looked for a couple of hours, and short of pulling up each tile individually for the floor and checking the cracks, I can say it's somewhere there, just somewhere I couldn't be fucked to look that thoroughly through. Big server room. I just made a new Patapon save.
Regardless, it's not really worth going through that large of an area with a fine toothed comb when it could be feasibly anywhere between the entrance to where I usually set up my laptop. In a secure room. (Physical lock + RFID) For my old employer. I've just kind of written it off like the coins I couldn't get out of Gox.
I'll probably get back in if there's ever a reputable banking service I can use aside from having to trust myself and my data storage, or some guy who trades Magic Cards.

Heck, you could make a new storefront every day and get *someone's* coins. Not sure what could prevent that though? TOR regulation and over-site? Not worth it. At least the Silk Road is reliable.

You technically could do straight trades for goods with stocks. Really you'd look more at the volume of trading to be done, currently bitcoin is no more money than taking a few ounces of gold, and quoting the merchant the current exchange prices on gold.
I'd say around the time we start to see substantial markets pop up priced around bitcoin (as opposed to having a fluctuating prices based on a ticker used to exchange to the merchants home currency) then I'd start to consider it a real currency, an intrinsically flawed one like gold, but one all the same.
