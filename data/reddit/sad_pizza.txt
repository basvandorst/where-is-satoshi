I wouldn't say 100%. Maybe 95%, since 95% of the people who buy Bitcoin do so solely on the unsupported belief that someone else will buy it for more, which is speculation at its purest form. Very few people buy Bitcoin because they believe that in the long-term it will play out as a viable, widely-used currency. People buy Bitcoin because they think someone else will buy it for $10k, $20k, or $50k. How do people arrive to those values? It's anyone's guess.

A lot of people here are just spouting out nonsense to further drive up the price. A few people here are saying that you literally cannot lose money by investing in bitcoin. Whether or not they genuinely believe it or not is not known. 
Sooner or later, at some unknown value, people are going to wake up to the fact that they have too much of their wealth stored in bitcoin (that they probably can't use for the purposes they need) and they'd rather hold onto/ a more stable currency. Then what happens from there happens.

The *technology* is getting better the *fundamentals* are still the same. Bitcoin is a deflationary asset with no underlying intrinsic value or use case (outside being spent as currency, which is still a small fraction of transactions).
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:06:57


You make excellent points. This is the big hang-up for me though. It's my opinion that it's going to take massive upheaval across the globe for Bitcoin to gain this "societal trust" and perhaps more importantly the backing and support from large institutions and governments. Bitcoin is like USD in that it has no intrinsic value, but unlike the USD it doesn't have the weight of the U.S. government (and its military) behind it. Bitcoin is, in this regard, a leap of faith or a bet on a collective trust between all members of society.
@_date: 2018-11-23 03:48:57


Any person who has taken a basic level economics course will tell you that Bitcoin is destined to fail as a prominent store of value or currency for two very fundamental reasons: (1) at the maturity of Bitcoin it will be deflationary and (2) there is no underlying intrinsic value or use cases. The concept and construct go against the very laws of economics and human behavior.  It has nothing to do with the technology (where I think there is potentially some value and practical applications). 
Yes, our financial system is far from perfect and the dollar gets inflated away every year (as it is supposed to). But the "financial savvy" thing to do is diversify your investments and put your money to good use so that you outpace inflation versus buying into some populist fantasy.

You have as much invested in crypto as you do in equity in your house? For the love God, stop putting money into crypto. If you're right and BTC hits lambo prices, you'd already be rich regardless. What you're doing is the equivalent of buying $1,000 of lottery tickets instead of buying just one drawing--overpaying for extremely little marginal benefit.

Selling doesn't lower the price unless the selling is done at a lower price.
If there are no transactions that use bitcoin, it effectively has no price. Something is only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it. Just because my grandmother's necklace is priceless to me and I would only sell it for a million dollars doesn't mean it's worth a million dollars.

I'm not talking about the value of Bitcoin, I'm talking about the feasibility of Bitcoin as a widely used currency. Bitcoin has no use cases outside being a medium of exchange, but who will use bitcoin to buy things if the value is only going to go up? No one. It's the same reason we don't use gold as money.

This is the crux of the problem. You *want* money that you can let sit there and do nothing while increasing its value without any risk. This is fantasy land. This is not how economics work. This "currency" would never be bought or sold, thus there would be no market for it and thus effectively no price.

People think they have to agree with taxes for them to be "valid." By that logic any and all taxes are voluntary. And by extension all laws are voluntary. This construct simply doesn't work.
This is the disconnect. People think they haven't consented to taxation when they actually have, through voting and participating in the political process. They just don't agree with the outcome. You have a right of say but not the ability (as an individual) to dictate outcomes as it pertains to rules and laws of a liberal society.

It seems the writing is on the wall for Bitcoin. It missed its chance to become a mainstream currency and now languishes as mainly a vehicle of speculation. It'll probably hold at this range for a brief period before another precipitous drop. This process will rinse and repeat as it trends towards its intrinsic value...

The US is a young country in absolute terms, but you have to look at history in the context of technology and change. From that perspective, the US has a deep and rich history that is comparable to societies and countries in the past.

You heard it from me a few months ago when it was trading around $9-$10k. I can probably take this exact post and use it 3 months down the line. 6 months down the line, etc. 
At the end of the day, if you think bitcoin is going up, then buy the "dip." I just don't see what would cause people to dump money into it. Perhaps a major uncontained financial crisis? But why bet any meaningful amount of money on such a tail-risk event? And there's no guarantee that people won't just flock towards the more traditional stores of value in any event.

By virtue of birth, yes, but that's how functioning societies work. You can't go around upending laws and rules you (as a singular individual) don't like without suffering the consequences, regardless of how you morally object to said rules or laws. The concept of consent in this context is largely irrelevant. You didn't have to consent to all the rules and laws that provide any sort of benefit to you because you didn't and shouldn't have to.

*Bad things*
1. Maximum number of bitcoin in circulation. Bitcoin is suffering through an identity crisis, oscillating between a "store of value" and a "currency." The notion of there being at most 21 million Bitcoin in circulation (thereby a deflationary asset) drove a lot of the hysteria that led to the massive pop in price. The problem is that anything deflationary makes for a terrible currency or medium of exchange. No one wants to spend using something they think will appreciate in value. Any reports I have seen on transaction data point to the fact that a very small percent of transactions were actual purchases--a vast majority of transactions was for the purchase of Bitcoin with fiat currency. So... if it's not a currency, then it must be a store of value, right? This leads to the 2nd item on the list...
2. No use cases outside being a medium of exchange or store of value. Generally, stores of value have some other underlying intrinsic value that acts as a floor on price. This provides a level of assurance that you're not just throwing value away. You can always live in a home. Natural resources can be used to produce items that can be sold or made into assets that can generate income. Bitcoin is an intangible asset without this property. Even the US dollar, which is not a store of value (not for the long-term at least), can always be used to pay debts and taxes as long as the U.S. government is still standing.
3. Decentralized. While being dependent on a decentralized construct has its obvious benefits and appeals, it does come with the drawback of not having the backing of a central institution. If there ever is a situation where shit hits the fan, who is going to step in? I'm not saying that I know that Bitcoin is vulnerable to attacks, because I don't. But at the same time, can we say with absolute certainty that the system is infallible?
*Things getting worse*
1. Volatility. The price fluctuates immensely seemingly without reason. Bitcoin seems to be sucked into a vicious cycle as a result. Volatility makes for a poor currency. Merchants don't want to accept it and buyers of goods don't want to use it. But if no one wants to use it, it won't ever reach a meaningful level of adoption. This will drive the price down. Rise and repeat.
2. Reputation as a speculative asset. It took your 80-year grandma putting money into Bitcoin and CNBC talking about it every half hour for the price to explode to $20k. People got burned when the bubble bursted and it is unlikely that interest is going to be ginned up to these proportions for a next time. I've seen some people on this sub counter this argument by saying people invested in tech companies after the dotcom bubble, but the difference there is that the tech companies that followed were different companies and even if they carried the same name, they were vastly different in terms of the business model and earnings profile (vs. the lack of such during the dotcom bubble). It is hard for me to see similar changes in Bitcoin that will change the zeitgeist.
With all this said, I don't believe Bitcoin is worthless. As long as there is a black market that relies on the privacy that Bitcoin provides, there will be a value that can and will be supported. I suspect this value to be lower than the current price because black market transactions with Bitcoin will probably remain a very niche use case, as an widespread use will lead to government crackdowns.
@_date: 2018-11-29 16:07:44
In absolute terms, hitting zero is next to impossible. Even inflated-to-death currencies like the Venezuelan bolivar (which is nearing a 1mm% inflation rate) still technically has some value, however small. But effectively, the it is worthless. This is a possible fate for bitcoin if people stop buying and selling and cease to use it completely.

@_date: 2018-07-05 16:30:11
Simple answer. The finite nature of bitcoin is one of the major roadblocks to it becoming a widely accepted form of currency.
Bitcoin does not exist in a vacuum. If I'm holding both cryto and fiat, and I need to transact, I'm probably going to transact with fiat. Why? Because I know that with almost complete certainty that the value of that dollar will be worth less in a year's time. The value of cryto is and will continue to be volatile and thus both buyers and sellers will be hesitant to transact with cryto. And since "true" transactions are very infrequent, the major drivers of the price of cryto will be the buying and selling of cryto with fiat (mainly, speculation). This ensures that the market will continue to be volatile. It's the ultimate catch-22.

I would say that the different stages of the internet resulted from the need for the technology and physical infrastructure to catch up to the idea and full potential. With cryptocurrency, I see technology to be more akin to speed bumps than the substantial hurdles that the internet faced on its way to maturity. 
The big hurdle for cryptocurrencies is the fact that mass adoption requires a flourishing user base... and to have a flourishing user base requires mass adoption. Whether there is any truth to it, cryptocurrencies have a higher perceived "cost of adoption" vs the internet (which was arguably very minimal). The internet was able to gradually accumulate users because there was very little cost to users if it all came crashing down. The user base grew at its own pace and the internet entered a virtuous cycle where adoption led to even more users and so on and so forth. Whereas for cryptocurrency, because of the perceived (or real) risk of losing a significant portion of your investment, people have largely remained on the sidelines. 10 years in and there are less than roughly 25 million addresses for Bitcoin. If you factor in individuals who have multiple addresses as well as for addresses with minimal or no bitcoin, there could only be 15-20 million people who hold bitcoin, which is less than a quarter of one percent of the world's population. It's difficult to estimate what ownership in the U.S. is said to be but a survey showed that 5% of the surveyed population owned Bitcoin. Even if we took these results at face value they pale in comparison to internet adoption. The first commercial ISP for the internet as we know it today came out in 1989. Roughly a decade later, in 2000, internet adoption was estimated to be between 40-50%.

I have no problems with his critiques of the financial system, as much of what he says in that regard is more or less accurate. Where I take issue is the lack of separation of what he *wants* to happen and what he *believes* will happen. Just because you want cryptocurrencies to uproot fiat money, doesn't mean it will happen or that you should willfully ignore the significant hurdles facing Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-18 22:31:18
Deflation isn't so much a risk as it is a limiting factor to bitcoin in becoming a viable currency. Very few will transact with a medium that will most certainly increase in value unless they absolutely have to. I believe bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will, if they maintain their relevance, behave more like stores of value.
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:02:19
The short answer is, there is no conventional method to valuing bitcoin. To start with, there are very few metrics around especially usuage/users that I would consider accurate.
The way I would describe cryptocurrency to your clients is that they are essentially super, super-squared, extremely out-of-the-money options on the current financial system combusting. In that event, the price of bitcoin would be astronomical. Absent such event, you will very likely lose your entire investment, albeit slowly.
Given, the risk-reward dynamics, there very little reason to invest any considerable amount in Bitcoin (if any), especially for HNW individuals.

There is something about the conviction in the way he speaks about what he thinks is going to happen in the future that just turns me away. Though I do not doubt Andreas is a true believer of cryptocurrency and bitcoin, a lot of times he does seem to speak almost like how a charlatan would. He seems very well-read and educated, yet so blinded by his own biases that he spends a lot of time in his speeches with one-sided arguments and hardly acknowledges, if ever, any flaws in his own arguments. He also throws out, in my opinion, foolish comparisons like nothing. He loves to compare bitcoin to revolutionary technologies such as the internet and cars while relegating the current monetary and banking system to the likes of the fax machine or horse &amp; buggy.
