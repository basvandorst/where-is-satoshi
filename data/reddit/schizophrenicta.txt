Who the hell would pay that much money for a defunct bank note? One that still exists in abundance?

Ah yes, that makes sense. Thanks for explaining!

Not to hate on Bitcoin, but to say that it is the best crypto in terms of technology is kind of weak.

Just throwing together a bunch of strawmen and ad hominems doesn't make a good comment.

Not anymore they don't. At least not nearly to the extent as even early 2017.

yeah this guy sounds like a preacher more than anything

Yes, let's get real. Illicit commerce is pretty much the trial by fire when it comes to Altcoins. I'm not at all saying that Cryptos should be limited to illegal use, I'm very much saying however that if a Crypto can't technically be safely and somewhat conveniently used for illegal commerce, it has no use. No. Use. Then there's almost no reason to abandon Credit Cards and Paypal. 
And boy has the bitcoin narrative changed in these parts.
