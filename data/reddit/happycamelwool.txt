Yes, you can visit our site on the clear web at  and purchase there using bitcoin.  We're currently setup to receive payments through Bitpay.  Though, personally we would rather you purchase on OpenBazaar to support the platform, but you will receive the same level of service at either place.
Our OpenBazaar storefront is at ob://

Thank you for doing this.

I just downloaded Bazaar Hound and it works pretty well for searching.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to remotely connect to my OpenBazaar server though. Looks like it's only a client for now.

We're very excited to be on OpenBazaar!  Thank you for posting this!

Actually this Ted Talk by [Neha Narula - The Future of Money]( might be the best explanation.

Definitely something by [Andreas Antonopoulos]( Maybe [Introduction to Bitcoin]( or this [Wired Money 2015 Talk - Bitcoin is the real disruptor]( by Andreas

That's correct. You wouldn't want some sort of malware watching your clipboard, grabbing screenshots, or keylogging to pickup your seed. A good place to start might be [Tails OS](  And it looks like [you can install VeraCrypt on Tails thought it needs to be the 32 bit version of Veracrypt.](

Yes, that's correct. The miner fee will be taken out when the block which your transaction is included is mined.

Have you tried Circle?  In our experience Circle provides a much better USD to BTC exchange rate than Coinbase does. 
@_date: 2016-09-23 04:23:34
We were unpleasantly surprised to find that Stripe (which uses Coinbase) is cash only exchange for bitcoin purchases. We found that Bitpay gives you the option of transferring to a bitcoin wallet, or exchanging as cash. This is why we chose Bitpay over Stripe/Coinbase on our ecommerce site.

Don't forget CoPay  it's definitely a favorite of ours.

It's a good one for sure as she does an excellent job explaining what bitcoin is.

Yup, should start any day now.

Congratulations! We're still working on getting our 2nd bitcoin as we've just begun to get into it.

What are you basing this on? A single report of a user not being log in?

Yes, you should backup your private pgp/gpg keys. Treat it just like your wallet seed(s) or private key(s).

Fantastic find! I haven't seen this video yet.

We just began accepting bitcoin at our online storefront.  In our everyday life we're also bringing up the topic of bitcoin with our friends, family and even helping them setup their wallets.  The only real way to get more retailers to accept bitcoin is by getting their customers to request it.  Unfortunately people are still under the impression that bitcoin is only for hackers and ransomware. 
You could take a look at OpenBazaar as they are an awesome decentralized marketplace which is bitcoin friendly.

This is something I've considered as well.  Ideally an excellent solution would be to create the encrypted file with your seed on clean live boot system.  Some distribution which isn't connected to the web, and then transfer the encrypted file via USB so that you can store in the cloud somewhere.

Ledger Wallet
Store ledger wallet 24 word seed offsite and/or memorize it. Check out cryptosteel for seed storage as another backup idea.   As a cheap alternative you could also stamp your seed in a piece of steel or aluminum. You would only need the first four characters of each word. 
As for the pin card, you can enable a mobile device to authenticate with instead of using the card.  As far as a hacker ordering a new pin card, they would need the original card which came in your ledger box plus your ledger Wallet device. 
Since adding my mobile device as a form of 2FA I haven't needed my pin card again.

You also might want to set her up with a wallet on her phone and send her some bitcoin so she can "experience" bitcoin. This is one of the easiest ways to get people to start asking questions about bitcoin.

Paypal's fees are high, not to speak of the nasty stuff they have done in the past, locking peoples accounts, preventing payments to certain entities, etc. They just weren't an option when choosing a payment option for our site. We ended up going with Stripe and Bitpay. I'm glad to see other people voting with their feet.

Check out [bitpay](  That's who we use on our ecommerce site

Which wallet software are you using? Most wallets will pull the miner fee out of remaining wallet balance and not the sending amount. This assumes you have enough in your wallet balance, or else the fee will be taken out of the sending amount.
