Options are much more complicated than buying cryptocurrency and almost as risky

Every single sub believes its coin is the Holy Grail and that crypto is a zero sum game

Same here. Too bad we're way behind the curve and buying ATH

WSB is all tendies, autism, and suicide memes because they have no concept of diversification

That's impossible because of the stock split. If Bitcoin goes to 50k, GBTC might be $100 depending how ridiculous the premium gets

1. I don't have to worry about my brokerage firm pulling a Mt. Gox or BitGrail
2. My brokerage has fraud protection if I get hacked
3. I don't have to worry about withdrawing to and maintaining a wallet; I can't lose GBTC shares
4. I can transfer money immediately from my direct deposit account to my trading account instead of waiting 7-10 for an exchange to get my bank transfer
5. There is more liquidity 
6. GBTC price is based on the global average and not an individual exchange
7. I can buy on margin

The stock market already recovered everything it lost since Jan 2

They said if we only broke 11.5k, 12k was around the corner. Instead it dropped almost $700 in less than an hour in a coordinated sell off

Honest question, no FUD - what is driving this increase? Is a return to 20k all time high justified given that LN still isn't out?

Claiming that the Venezuelan Bolivar is a early sign of what will happen to other fiat currencies like the USD, Euro, Yen, etc is woefully ignorant of the unique circumstances surrounding Venezuela. Their entire economy was based on one commodity, crude oil, that massively dropped in price, there's no comparison to developed Western economies

When this same shit meme was posted on another crytpo subreddit, someone correctly pointed out that the majority of recent investors in Bitcoin were college age or younger and had likely little to no participation in the formal economy and were clueless about banks

Your mistake is thinking Bitcoin will continue to be the crypto leader

Old money shitting on new techs they don't understand

Source? I want to send this to my dad and friends who are anti-crypto and always on Buffet's dick
Edit: found it

Lol that's a ridiculous comparison. Stocks have actual valuation while 99% of crypto is speculation on future potential

Over/under on how many minutes the global average stays at or above 11k before manipulators take it back down again?

Watching that 8200, 159 BTC wall go down on Binance in 15 seconds was beautiful
