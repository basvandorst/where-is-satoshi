So even though Antpool has about 18% of the total Blockchain (one of the biggest) , should I move my cloudmining to a smaller pool with smaller fees.

Try the Cashapp.  I’ve done it dozens of times and the fee is lower than Coinbase.

Then go with the cashapp

Robinhood it’s also possible (depending if your state allows it yet) but you can only buy and sell coins.  You can’t withdraw them at all yet.

Search for real world examples of other real estate companies doing it.  There’s quite a few.  There’s also an Airbnb type company that exclusively accepts bitcoin.  Can’t remember the name though, sorry.  Good luck.

I took this picture a couple hours ago but nothing else posted about it could be seen

Sorry, there was none where the picture was taken

Didn’t they lower the rate or increased the minimum deposit because it became too popular?  BTW Nexo finance does the exact same thing.

I wonder how services like bitcoinrewards and Lolli handle this.  They reward you bitcoin like cashback for purchasing through their sites but they don’t require any type of kyc to move them.....for now at least

Use Lolli to get bitcoin back for online purchases.  Use Honeyminer to mine bitcoin on any computer.  Use Openbazaar to sell your stuff for bitcoin.  Use Long game savings app to win bitcoin just for saving money.  There are plenty of legit ways to get bitcoin without actually paying for it.
