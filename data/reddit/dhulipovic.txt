Thanks a lot for your reply  I am impressed by the initial blog post about this  and would really love to learn more.
Also curious how you support/manage cold storage -&gt; hot wallet transfers effectively when there is sudden surge in trading volume (when 2% in hot wallet isn't sufficient to handle the volume)

Thanks coinbase for giving a easy way to acquire coins legally. Do you guys use Trezor or some hardware wallet for cold storage or do you still use usb drives?
Do you recommend any hardware wallet that you like?

For coldstorage do you use banks or do you rent buildings that you use as your vault?
Are coldstorage locations chosen based on least possibility for natural disaster and also in very low crime areas? 
Would be great if you could give an example of one such city or state(Mostly asking for my personal purpose to decide the best place to open a safety deposit box at a bank in most secure location). I am from california but I am thinking Seattle might be safer without earthquakes and tsunamis.

Are you confident of coinbase security to the point that you personally keep all your bitcoins in your coinbase account ?

Definitely not out of fear, this is the first year I actually spent coins/withdrew into my personal wallet from exchange. Read somewhere in thread that withdrawals to hardware wallets are also treated as sells(which sounds ridiculous). So want to make sure and follow the due diligence and not worry about one more thing.
