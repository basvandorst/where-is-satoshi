Yes, Bitcoin is actually excluded from the credit driven system in the same way gold is excluded. It's money, not a stock. If the velocity of money slows down and the credit system implodes, then people will exchange their fiat for sound money. People will have to use gold or crypto as a tool for price discovery in order to find what was overvalued and bring it back to fair value. It will be pretty messy at first, but historically that's what happens.
All I'm saying about buy backs is that it's another factor contributing to the overvaluation.

Can you please make Peter Schiff one of those bosses?

Stocks are overvalued because the entire system depends on credit. It's pumped into the stock exchange and artificially drives up prices. The fed is intervening in the repo market and cutting rates just to keep the charade going. Not to mention these stock buy backs are contributing to the increase share price. 
Bitcoin hasn't reached a stage where it is a store of wealth yet. It has to be widely accepted as a medium of exchange before it actually stores wealth. It's too volatile when you compare it's value against the dollar. However, the volatility is net positive so that's actually a good thing if you see it as an investment (even though I try not to look at it that way).

10 years feels fast to me. To overcome all it has in that short amount of time is pretty amazing.

How is capitalism the problem when the game is acknowledging socialism via the bank's central planning? If you combine capitalism with government then you end up with fascism.
I think the Bitcoin dream is to have fair trade through sound money. And to take the government's power to seize that money.

Are you saying that even if a majority of miners collude to fork bitcoin and increase the supply cap, then it wouldn't matter unless the users agreed to go down that new path? The existing users could just continue using bitcoin as it is today and the people that created the fork would have essentially wasted their time. Is that correct?

In theory, yes. In reality, no. Fiat is already in trouble, but it comes down to confidence in the dollar. It will take a major sell off of dollars from foreign countries to expose how much it has been inflated. Then you'll see people scramble to buy assets with value. Gold will be one of those assets. This is why you don't see a direct correlation. It takes time.
