1. `maxuploadtarget=144` in your bitcoin.conf will attempt to limit daily uploading to that amount in MB. This is the minimum recommended, will discontinue serving historical blocks for the rest of the day after that but still provide all other node hashing and peer services.
2. SPV/bloom *is* a possible avenue of abuse/DoS. `peerbloomfilters=0` in your bitcoin.conf will disable it. Even the bitcoin devs admit this is broken and there are very few legitimate uses for it, ~~ironically one is the bitcoin core android wallet~~.

You can also just ban the IP subnet CIDR at the firewall (host &lt;hostname&gt;, whois &lt;IP&gt; and look for the CIDR range). My electrum server was getting hammered by phish until I blocked Digital Ocean at the firewall (their preference for VMs, change IPs daily). Availability skyrocketed afterwards.

Glad to help. Serendipity: You are the second person *today* to mention VPN (are you using it now or planning it in the future?). Apparently there is an issue (not with Electrum but with VPN settings) when connecting over VPNs that the devs jumped on and figured out the problem:
What other wallet has that kind of dev backing?
Remember: BTC lives on the blockchain forever in every synced node (including mine), *not* in the wallet - it only contains the keys. You can recreate the keys on an infinite number of devices using Electrum as long as you know the seed words or have the wallet file available. Somebody on IRC calculated that it would take more than the lifetime of the universe to guess *half* a wallet key from seed using what we believe is the strongest computing available today so it should be pretty secure :)

EPS is indeed excellent but not a push-button solution for several reasons:
1. Requires a full bitcoin node to be running underneath - this can be a pruned node with as little as 5 GB storage but then needs to remain online for continued syncing.
2. Bitcoin node must initally sync the entire blockchain (\~220 GB) even with reduced (pruned) final storage so initial download time / bandwidth is quite high.
3. EPS is a separate project from Electrum - Chris Belcher is a bitcoin dev. The software is lightweight but needs a config file - there is no web/gui setup. It's not hard to do but requires some cli skill.
So, it is not really practicable for average joe/jane/ze with a laptop. It would make a great project similar to raspiblitz or casanode (for lightning).

A new (empty) Electrum wallet should synchronize instantly and no specific ports need to be open on your router. Could be an ISP level block sending to electrum server ports (50001/50002) which you can't do anything about.
I would recreate the wallet (from seed words) on another device (phone or Windows computer). If you still can't sync using the same network it definitely sounds like a networking issue not Electrum/Ubuntu. You could still access your BTC using Electrum on another device/network.
As someone else said, if the transaction is visible on a web explorer, the BTC is there so take a deep breath.

Bitcoin Core is actually the reference implementation that the entire system is based upon. If anyone is "Bitcoin", they are *and that's what the OP was looking for.* Anyone can use the term "Bitcoin", there is no trademark or corporation, but there should be clarity, especially when involving software in an official (Ubuntu) channel and involving forks like BCH, BCHABC, BCHSV, etc.
Not sure what this comment was implying (Shill?) It quotes the maintainer of the bogus snap package from a long argument where he tries to defend it and comes across as disingenuous to me.
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:22:11
Which illustrates my point - GPL or other FOSS licensed software (and any modifications) are required to be made public, *not* anything developed from scratch like Dockerfiles or docker-compose. Notice they are on dockerhub, not github. This doesn't even take into consideration the inevitable configuration issues. 
Is also why I posted links to the other similar projects that can actually be built. Good luck on your project - you can get nearly the same functionality (less the interface) using them right now.

Snap uses a package delivery system that includes all its dependencies in one neat package using an overlay file system and is probably the future of software distribution. Docker (which is the rage in containerization for good reason) uses it too. I converted my entire server stack to docker containers and have had no performance decrease. I don't think it is the snap packaging that was the problem.
What you experienced is a shortcoming for every linux distro regardless of the packaging system - you are *trusting the package maintainer* to package the legitimate software. This trust has been broken before, not just for bitcoin. BTC is obviously a juicy target due to its financial nature.
As you found out and others were quick to mention, *always* download your financial software from the proper known source and verify it before using it. Just look at the trouble Electrum has had partly due to this.
~~Bitcoin core also has a PPA available directly.~~
@_date: 2019-06-21 18:26:43
This is the reason why BTC is so secure - the exact same questions could be asked of any transaction on the public blockchain. Without access to the private keys needed to create a signed transaction (send BTC) the BTC is inaccessible and therefore lost. It is unlikely any significant information can be gleaned from the receiving (public) address you posted. 
It looks like from your user history that you've been seeking help for this for at least a year and reported similar problems with other wallets/cryptocurrencies going back at least 2 years.
@_date: 2019-02-09 22:20:21
In that case, disregard using the PPA. Been a few years since I used Ubuntu desktop and even then compiled from source. Thanks for the clarification

Actually, running BTC over Tor adds unnecessary risk and is generally a bad idea. A spooky friend of mine believes the US Govt now runs at least a third of *all* tor nodes. Think blockchain analysis firms are bad? Right from Coindesk:
[Bitcoin-Over-Tor Anonymity 'Can be Busted for $2,500 a Month'](
And that was known in 2014 . . . .
You didn't mention your setup and technical skill level. I have a similar setup on my personal server with a public IP but would *never* allow EPS server connections from the wild web. You can easily set up a SSH tunnel from your laptop to your home server encrypting port 50002 basically creating a single port VPN and thereby use your EPS from anywhere. It is a single one-line linux command:
    ssh username -L 50002:localhost:50002
From EPS Github:
Once that's done don't forget to run electrum using Chris's excellent advice from the same page:
    electrum --oneserver --server localhost:50002:s
Otherwise your wallet will ping multiple servers thereby exposing all 2,000 of your addresses (balances) to them. This keeps electrum talking only to your EPS.
@_date: 2019-06-21 18:43:11
First rule - breathe, don't panic. Your BTC is not lost.
Transactions are removed from the mempool (by nodes with standard settings) after 72 hours. Your  wallet may be rebroadcasting it when you open it.
Some wallets have RBF (replace by fee) - it is standard on Electrum. Check to see if it is available on your wallet and if you used it for these transactions. You may also be able to do a "child pays for parent" transaction - you will need to research this further as it is beyond the scope of r/ to walk you through this.
The mempool on my node has cleared out to 1 sat/byte as little as 2 days ago and frequently does on weekend nights - you may have to wait a few days.
@_date: 2019-06-29 11:55:44
Electrum will connect to servers over whatever network connection your host OS is using - the wallet doesn't care and it is irrelevant to the actual BTC transactions - they are stored on the BTC blockchain in every full node worldwide once broadcast. It can work over clearnet, VPN, tor, or anything that gives WAN access to the internet.
@_date: 2019-02-26 13:57:40
Most of my simple (non-segwit) transactions come in around 1kb (1,024 bytes) if that helps. Fee right now is running about 35 cents for that size transaction (30 sat/byte)

Absolutely. Open port 8333 to the world.
**BUT:** Be absolutely sure you understand and have RPC authentication set up properly if you forward port 8332 in your bitcoin.conf - it shouldn't be necessary unless you want to control the daemon remotely. Until recently it was completely insecure by default and you would absolutely get robbed from the default wallet if you didn't. This has been changed in most distros now (I think) - not sure about the Pi. Someone else here can surely verify.

\+1 for KVM, I also switched to using it (with Centos/RHEL) and get near-native performance.

@_date: 2019-06-18 01:18:22
Just be aware that by pruning you will *have* to keep the chain synced within whatever time frame the pruned amount is - 9 GiB should be about 2 months worth - to be able to access your wallet. If you go longer between syncing (and this obviously can take some time) you will have to download the entire blockchain and prune it again. On a laptop expect to leave it running at least overnight once a week to sync depending on your internet speed.

It's built on Docker and you'll have to spin it up yourself - I don't think it's as simple as a docker-compose file (and I'm a Docker guy).
"Note that building your own images from sources is not easy. The build  process is quite complex and involves several code repositories."
They have to open source the GPL and other FOSS licensed stuff - I'm not sure they are going to open all the proprietary stuff (like docker-compose files) and provide simple build instructions - would seem like an invitation for the entire country of China to start pumping out crappy (comporomised?) clones if that were the case.
@_date: 2019-04-16 23:30:32
Wallets do not have "fees"
The bitcoin network has fees - the more you pay the faster your transaction will be confirmed and these fees change dynamically with bitcoin network demand - this will be the the same on all wallets.
Using a web wallet like the one listed as  above is a *bad idea* anyway. This smells like a commercial to me . . .

This kind of rules out your wallet (Electrum) as it transfered your BTC to the paper address correctly. 
You have to be *very* careful with paper wallets - whomever generates the paper wallet address obviously has access to your BTC. So, it should be you and only you who generates any addresses.

Electrum has the option to make several kinds of wallets - Segwit (newer) and Legacy (older) assuming you aren't using 2FA or multisig (advanced) .
~~Try creating both a Segwit and Legacy wallet with your seed words - I'll bet one of them works.~~ Edit: restoring from seed automatically selects wallet type.

1. You can run bitcoin core with as little as 5GB in a "pruned" mode. It will still have to download the entire chain initially but only keeps the most current 5GB. It is a simple edit to the config file, the GUI may have the option as well.
2. You can probably get better Electrum specific advice on r/Electrum

Exactly. The problem with BTC loss is user error/ignorance and is not reported. When factoring in users utilizing high-risk services like web wallets it is almost certainly far higher in aggregate than the current Electrum malware phishing. All wallets are included.
Not starting a pissing contest; Mycellium uses Electrum protocol and forked servers but relies on a centralized organization to supply them so you are dependent on a small number of people for access to your BTC.

Don't let the current DDoS attack sour you on BTC and Electrum
@_date: 2019-04-18 11:34:05
In your bitcoin.conf add the line
    prune=5000
will prune the blockchain to the minimum of 5 GB (less than a month right now I think). You can set it to any amount of MB you want. I believe there may be an option in the GUI to do this.
Be aware that this will still download the *entire*  blockchain initially (\~228 GB) and index it but will only permanently store the most recent blocks that fit into the storage amount you specify with prune. It is rolling storage - you *do not* have to have 228 GB of storage available. Unfortunately this will require downloading the entire 228 GB chain again to prune :(
You will also still have to sync  bitcoin to the network at least as often as the pruned amount - if you don't, there will be a hole in the blockchain and you will have to start over. With prune=5000 you should sync at least once a week to be safe. You may need to be on the network (internet) for some time depending on your internet speed to catch up - I let it run at least overnight.
If you change to another wallet that has transactions older than your prune amount it will not sync and you must repeat the entire process.

I used to use Ubuntu to run VMs (virtualbox) but had WAY too many problems similar to yours so dumped it and switched the host/hypervisor to Fedora/Centos - never had another problem since then. Yours sounds like a VM problem, not a bitcoin problem. The Ubuntu PPA has usable (if old) version. Remember, BTC core will run just fine on a Rasberry Pi so VM resources are extremely unlikely to be the cause. You could also try a VM running another OS (Centos) with BTC ([ringingliberty.com]( has packages) and see if that solves your problem without completely rebuilding the host/hypervisor.
