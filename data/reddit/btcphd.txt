A 20MB limit only puts Bitcoin at PayPal-like levels of transaction capacity. I don't think this is even a question of scalability, but of basic utility. How the block limit is getting raised may be rightfully subject to some scrutiny, but I don't think anyone honestly believes Bitcoin can scale globally with 1MB blocks, even with off-chain proposals. And there's really no reason to think we need to keep blocks that small either. 20MB is still a reasonable enough limit that it shouldn't affect the long term risk of 'not enough decentralization'. We can gain increased utility without forgoing security in any meaningful way; I'd feel just as secure on the 20MB blockchain versus the 1MB blockchain.

You're a moron. What good would come from suing a company that has barely any cashflow? Maybe you're just naive and talking out of your ass, but in case you're unfamiliar with how the legal process works, winning a case is a lot different than winning and actually being able to collect the awarded judgement. It'd be a colossal waste of throwing more money at lawyers over a $10k debt owed by a company that is probably on the brink of bankruptcy.

Why can't the block reward be given to the miner, while transaction fees are averaged and paid to the last ten or next ten blocks? This way a miner can't spam their own blocks without losing 90% of the fees.

They act as an exchange though, so whether or not they hold the funds, they're facilitating the transaction and charging a fee on the spread. That seems to qualify them under the Bit License.

I don't like the additional voting power given to miners under the BIP100 proposal. They already have the right to vote on the size of their own blocks. Allowing them to permanently restrict the max block size is a dangerous path to go down. Miners have equipment that is becoming more obsolete by the day, so they have short term financial goals in mind; the best max block size limit to a miner may not be the best limit for users and the network as a whole.

I think part of the point of Bitcoin is that it's non-exclusionary; the blockchain doesn't care if you're a human or non-human. Your priority on the blockchain should be determined by objective measures that both humans and non-humans will have to abide by equally, e.g., transaction fees.

Miners already have a vote, in that they can choose to self-govern their own blocks even if the limit is removed completely. Allowing the max block size limit to be set by miners is giving them too much power to restrict an otherwise free market. This will threaten the ability of Bitcoin to scale as needed. Instead, the limit should be based on what the network is technically capable of. If 60% of these Chinese mining pools are self-governing and limiting their own blocks, that in and of itself is going to create a higher demand for fees. It's unfair to give 60% of miners a vote over 100% of all other miners though, especially when we can't really say for sure that 100% of the users of these pools agree with the 8MB proposal. If we are going with 8MB, then I would really like to see a way to double to the max block size when &gt;50% of blocks are &gt;50% full. Something like that would give a bit of power back to those who actually hold and use Bitcoin, because it is those of us who use it who give it value; we shouldn't be beholden to 5 Chinese mining pools who decide how many transactions the network can process. Mining equipment becomes obsolete, so 60% of the network today may only be 30% of the network a year from now. Furthermore, a miner's short-term interest is to make as much money as possible before their hardware needs replacing, so allowing current miner's to create artificial hard limits across the whole network is heading down a dangerous road. I am glad we're making progress on this block size issue, but I don't think this is the best solution. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 21:27:19

The machine must first be purchased for thousands of dollars, it's location may require a rent payment, and the machines require ongoing maintenance. If an ATM is only getting 100 customers a month, and those customers only withdrawal small amounts, a 1% fee won't be enough to cover the overhead. So instead, ATMs usually charge a per use fee. You're right, the actual transaction only costs pennies, but the machine being there in working order is what you're paying for. So to pay for the machine and make a profit, the owner is better off charging 100 customers a $5 fee.

There are plenty of ATMs with a $5 service fee, so if you only withdraw $20, you will be charged that fee regardless. This isn't so much an issue of how Bitcoin ATMs operate, but how the private ATM business operates as a whole. The business model is such that you can't be profitable on a $20 transaction by only charging a 1% fee, thus they set minimums. On a $500 transaction, a $5 fee is a nominal 1% of the transaction. It's just how markets work, i.e., buy more, save more.

I think this is a good thing. That the miners are forced to sell a large percentage of their block reward to cover their operating expenses means that anyone can purchase these new bitcoins, as opposed to the alternative, where miners would only have to sell a small percentage of their coins, allowing the miners to hold onto and control an ever growing percentage of all the bitcoin that will ever exist.

Wealth is not a discussion for another day, this discussion is already about wealth. Exchanging money received at low interest rates for scarce resources, equities, and real estate is what increases the long term wealth of an individual. This is what is happening with the low interest new money that is being created, and that is the entire point. The 1% is referring to the top percentage of Americans who control 99% of the wealth in this country -- have you really not heard this reference before? These individuals have enough wealth to build relationships with banks wherein they're allowed to borrow at nearly the same rates that banks borrow at. They're using their position and the power of wealth to control greater percentages of wealth creating asset classes. Exchange one nearly free dollar today for an asset that will return more dollars in the future. That's capitalism, but in this case, the rich aren't creating anything of value, they're just leveraging existing wealth to gain more control via convoluted monetary policy and corrupt lending practices. So how does greater control of a resource by one individual lead to any sort of trickle down effect?

As I said, the government can also garnish wages. You seem to be ignoring that point because you clearly don't have a solution for how people will earn the money they're not going to be paying taxes on. If the company you work for doesn't comply with withholdings, the government will seize their assets or switch from taxing individuals to directly taxing businesses to make up for lost revenue. Moreover, millions of Americans hold government jobs, and if they want to keep those jobs and feed their families, they'll keep paying taxes. So what's your solution there, wise guy? You think you're going to coordinate a simultaneous, nationwide tax revolt with cooperation from companies and government employees whom depend on the US government for their livelihood? I think you're underestimating the US government's ability and willingness to take drastic measures to collect tax revenue. The minute you try organizing something like this on a large enough scale, those in charge will be arrested on conspiracy charges and the whole thing will fall apart. They don't have to arrest a million people all at once. You think you'll have millions on your side, but then the reality of not being able to work or feed a hungry child will set in, and before you know it, your million is now a hundred thousand, and then tens of thousands, until eventually your resistance has dwindled to a point where they realize they now have enough jail cells for each and every one of you.

But plenty of nodes could handle a limit well above 1MB, and as bandwidth improves, that limit can be raised even higher without any real risk of centralization. The only real downside to raising the block size limit is long term storage and the ability of low bandwidth connections to propagate transactions. Both those issues will become non-issues as technical standards across the globe are improved. Keeping the block size limit low for the sake of including users with a bandwidth speed in the bottom 5% is like saying that all cell phone apps should be backwards compatible with an old Nokia from the 90's.

His success with Cnet was little more than being in the right place at the right time.

Increase the block size but start giving nodes a small percentage of the transaction fees. There's little incentive to run a node, but they do expend energy and require time to maintain. Giving nodes something like 10% of the transaction fee for transactions they are the first to broadcast would, in my opinion, result in a large increase in people running nodes.

Over a long enough time period I suppose you're right, I shouldn't say it's never going to pop. What I meant is that it's not going to pop any time soon. It's hard to say though, because the government keeps changing the rules. If a company fails, are they really going to be allowed to fail? More likely, in my opinion, is that larger companies will be given sweetheart deals to take over failing companies instead of letting those companies collapse the financial markets. The companies will keep the good and the government will assume liability for the bad, just like last time.

What?! Because that's impossible, that's why. 


And your point is? Including spam or a bunch of data on the blockchain may in the best interest of the miner in the short term; the reason it's not done now is because there is a limit to the block size. It's not something other miners or users could reject though, so I suggest you educate yourself better on how exactly Bitcoin works before making that argument.  You can't use what has happened in the past to defend your very shaky and misinformed position since that is not a situation in which miner's even had the option to do what I am referring to.

I can't name your company for you, but if you're just trying to develop a platform that is to be integrated into other services, why not adopt a simpler name for a parent company, with the product name itself being unique? It would make more sense to develop a piece of software under a more generic moniker that is easily remembered, and then you can still name the actual product whatever you want, e.g., EMC has Xtremio and Isilon, Apple has Siri, and Satoshi Labs makes the Trezor. Even companies like the ones you mentioned are owned by very generic sounding parent companies: Marlboro is owned by Philip Morris, and brands like Louis Vuitton, Hublot, Dior, and Tag Heuer are operated by the boring sounding parent company LVMH. These brand names are common place now thanks to massive marketing efforts by those generic sounding parent companies, but I doubt we're going to see the name Novauri in magazines or rap videos anytime soon. 
Microsoft, for example, could easily introduce an exchange called Novauri, because if I couldn't remember the name of the actual product, I'd just have to search for "Microsoft Exchange" or "Decentralized Trading Microsoft" and the Novauri product would likely be returned to me in the search results. Alternatively, I could visit the easy to spell and remember microsoft.com and find it there. 
If the Novauri product came from a company who's name I could've easily remembered, it wouldn't have taken a random stumbling upon this post for me to find your company again. I tried searching for "new decentralized exchange" and similar search terms to find Novauri, which you *could* buy adwords for, but those search terms are not ones you want to have to compete for. That's like having to compete to be a top search result for "Bitcoin Wallet". If nothing else, at least find all the common misspellings for Novauri and buy those adwords, because like I said in a previous post, I got pretty close a few times, but it wasn't enough to get where I was trying to go. In my head I had it viva voce as "NO-VAR-EE", which I wanted to spell as Novari or Novaris, which makes the most sense to a speaker of any latin-influenced language. Personally, I like Novari a lot better than Novauri, because I can't decide if Novauri should be pronounced "NO-VOW-REE" or "NO-VAR-EE". It's like how the words "meme" and "gif" get mispronounced by people who've only been exposed to the words in text. 
Anyway, I think you get the point I am trying to make, and if you decide to go with something simpler, that shouldn't be too hard to come up with by yourself or among your team. 
Either way, I've got you bookmarked now, so I shouldn't have trouble finding Novauris next time.

What do you mean it will be rejected by the community? You do not understand how Bitcoin works if you think the next miner can just reject the previous block. The block is accepted based on PoW, not on what is contained within the block. Unless the same block is solved twice and the second solve propagates quicker, the first block is accepted and miners begin working on solving the next block. Don't tell me I am being naive when you don't even understand how the protocol works.

I'll address issue 




The use of Bitcoin isn't just about the act of recording the transaction though. The article states the following: 


It is very clear how Bitcoin would eliminate much of this front-end fraud, and that is because Bitcoin transactions confirm in around 10 minutes. When a company is using Bitcoin, they don't have to worry about whether the customer has enough funds in their bank account; it's known whether the transaction is properly funded within minutes, not days. There is no risk of a user reporting fraudulent use of their credit card or bank account either. And since you don't need a middle man, you can eliminate employee impersonation by dealing directly with the person you wish to remit funds to. It's pretty easy to know your funds are going to the right place when you can get on Skype and talk directly to that person and confirm their receiving address and how much to send. 
Eliminating entire fraud prevention departments is a huge cost savings for these companies. If an executive at Western Union walked into a meeting and proposed a sound method for eliminating 99% of the accounting and risk management department, along with outsourcing the maintenance of the back-end network, he'd be a hero. 
This author claims to have researched the financials of traditional remittance companies, yet they couldn't reach this conclusion on their own? I hate to call anyone a shill, but either this author has ulterior motives for trying to debunk Bitcoin remittances or this is some sort of make-a-wish "be a journalist for a day" charity.

Looks like they're just trying to spin this in a positive light, as if Bitcoin users aren't smart enough to see through the bullshit.

That's fine if you think that, but you have no data to back up what is nothing more than a hunch.

If I lease a building for $5k a month in order to start a restaurant, and then I don't even start a restaurant, I can't blame the landlord for my inability to pay rent. You seem to be jumping on the bandwagon of the contract being unfair without having any real understanding of the situation or contract law in general.

So why not optimize miners to have a separate CPU for block validation? You'd only need one per mining operation, or maybe two just for the sake of redundancy. By the time they discover a new block based on headers from another source, they should have been able to verify that those headers were correct on their own machine before broadcasting a block based on that information received from a 3rd party, no?


My residential connection is symmetric, option of 100/100 or 1000/1000, and plenty of cities across the US are upgrading to fiber networks with similar configurations. Technology isn't stagnant, and it's already to a point where we can avoid any worrisome risk of centralization. Just because Billy Bob can't run a full node on his farm in the middle of Iowa, that doesn't mean the whole network will become centrally controlled by an elite few. 


20TB hard drives are already here and they're no more expensive than a new laptop. That's already enough to store 10 years worth of the blockchain at almost 200GB a month. By the time we get to a blockchain that size, we'll probably have 1PB hard drives for a similar cost.

There is no requirement for a fee now, so this would still allow miners to set fees based on market pricing, but it would prevent miners from including limitless fee-free transactions in the blockchain. One of the arguments against unlimited block size is to prevent spam and bloat, which makes sense, so by limiting the block size of fee-less transactions, you can eliminate that threat, while still allowing the miners to set fees for a block size of varying limits.

I'm not sure you're understanding the issue.

A lot of the arguments I've heard for keeping the block size limit low come specifically from people with low bandwidth connections who want to run a full node; I agree it won't be an issue as technology progresses, but that's the argument some people are currently making. 
Regarding storage size, that may or may not be an issue, but we've barely any users relative to all people on Earth, and there are still many possible uses we haven't even seen yet.

This bandaid at least keeps Bitcoin useable over the short term, and while it'd be nice to have a longer term plan already in place, I am not that worried about it happening eventually. Dissenters won't win this battle. The block size limit has to be able to handle transactions on a global scale; there are great solutions for micro-payments that keep the bulk of those transactions off the blockchain, but for higher value transactions, people need to be able to transfer bitcoin in a timely manner directly on the blockchain. We'll get to that point because we have to.

I am familiar with the original proposal, but I don't think that is what this is.

Raising it to 20MB still isn't the "real" or "clean" solution. Raising it to 20MB is giving us breathing room while a permanent solution is developed. The 1MB limit was too low even for today's needs, so a 20x increase will only last us a few years before we need to implement the permanent fix.

The 20MB limit that is being proposed now is being done so that a more thorough, permanent solution can be carefully developed. Your desire to see multiple solutions presented is exactly why Gavin is only proposing a simple 20MB limit for the time being. The 1MB limit is inhibitively low even for today's use, and we can't let confirmation times grind to a halt while a long term fix is developed. A 20MB limit allows for some breathing room while multiple solutions can be critiqued and modified until we reach an acceptable long term solution.

It's not their cost alone. If there is no block size limit, then everyone else has to store that block in perpetuity, no matter its size. Yes, there is propagation risk, but that can be gamed. This is why there needs to be some upper limit to the size of ta block or else some limit to the number of fee-less transactions, it would also make sense to distribute fees to multiple miners over a recent block period or else the miners are just being returned their own fees. There are multiple reasons why a miner might do this. Maybe they're being paid by a spammer, maybe it's just to vandalize the blockchain, or maybe they're using the blockchain to freely store data; likely plenty of yet unknown reasons too.

We're still seeing 10% inflation right now, and we don't know how many coins are ready to be sold on top of that, so while I agree that we'll eventually see coins leaving the actively traded market, we don't know when enough coins will leave to actually move the price; it could be next week, it could be next year.

Someone buys $500 worth of Bitcoin, the company buys an option or a futures contract that allows them to sell Bitcoin at the same exchange rate within 72 hours.

It'd still be an arbitrary percentage with no relation to actual need or usage. The point of the simple 20MB increase is to allow time to find a better method for handling long term scaling of the block size. Any scaling done on a flat yearly percentage increase is short-sighted and could have unintended consequences, e.g., not scaling fast enough or scaling too fast.

Government controlled fiat currencies and Bitcoin can coexist, quit trying to pretend like Bitcoin is going to overthrow the government. The solution isn't to just say "fuck 'em", the solution is to start voting for people who respect your personal freedom, start voting for people who will not get in the way of your freedom to choose whether to use a dollar or a bitcoin. Start voting for people who will pull back the curtain on the Fed and give "we the people" a chance to judge for ourselves whether we agree with how our government is managing the US dollar. And don't just voice your opinion in the voting booth, be active and vocal in your everyday life as well. Too many people have become complacent and want to act like we've already lost the war, but that isn't true. Apathy is the greatest threat to the American people today. Bitcoin has a place and will thrive because it has no borders, but there are benefits to an inflationary currency too. The brightest future, in my opinion, is one where we have freedom of choice.

That's not how it works, buddy. A miner can't start mining the next block without the information from the previous block, and the longest block is the one that is considered valid. So just because one miner decides not to accept it, that won't prevent another miner from mining based on the bloated/spammed block. If another block is solved on top of that block, then a miner now has 2 blocks to solve in order to catch up and introduce a blockchain that doesn't include that bloated/spammed block. Rejecting that block becomes unlikely unless you have a second solve for that block before someone solves on top of the original solve.

Is it really necessary for miners to keep the full blockchain past 10 years or so? We can still archive previous years of the blockchain at set checkpoints, which perhaps when needed can be referenced and reintroduced into the current chain. If such a solution were implemented, it shouldn't be a problem for the average user to store the entire current 10 year blockchain + compressed archives. Transactions and coins wouldn't disappear; we only have 21,000,000 coins to account for at any given time. We'd just give up real time access beyond certain points.

I was sort of in agreement with you up until the past few weeks, but Coinbase is clearly going above and beyond what they're required to do when it comes to tracking the bitcoin and spending patterns of their users. You may not see that as an issue if you're not doing anything wrong with your coins, but those coins trace directly back to you; should something nefarious occur with your coins, Coinbase will not hesitate to hand over your personal information to the authorities. Unless you want to pay an additional premium to tumble your coins before ever using them, you now have to worry not only about what you're using the coins for, but what the people you send coins to are using them for. If you buy a gift card on craigslist with bitcoin, and then that person goes on to a darknet market to purchase drugs, there's now a worrisome chance that you could have your door kicked in by the FBI/DEA/Postal Inspectors/etc. I don't know about you, but that's not something I want any part of.  When I pay for whatever it is I am buying, legitimate or otherwise, I want that to be the end of the transaction; I don't want Coinbase guessing whether or not I am still in possession of the coins.

You're not making sense and you clearly don't understand the issue. These coins are created by someone else to whom you're trusting with the private key to your coin. If you insist on doing something like this, and you plan on holding the coin yourself until redemption, then you could have a BIP038 address held on the coin that only you have the password for. But even then, you're forfeiting all the other encryption measures that Bitcoin offers in favor of BIP038 encryption, which depends heavily on the security of the key passphrase you choose. The creator of your coin, if they so choose to, could start brute forcing the address from day one, and within your lifetime, there is a decent chance they'll succeed.

I think the notion that this subreddit refuses to hear criticism is false. Certainly some people can't take criticism, which is true for any group, but I think a lot of Bitcoin's most active users are also its biggest critics. The difference being that we don't see many of the critiques as fatal flaws. I don't think Bitcoin is perfect as it exists today, but I've yet to see a problem presented which doesn't have a reasonable likelihood of a solution somewhere down the line. 
Ironically, it seems to me that it's the ones deriding and critiquing from outside of Bitcoin that are most likely to refuse a real debate. They come in expecting a "gotcha" response, but more often than not are met with a logical solution or explanation. It seems to upset those outsiders when we don't immediately sell off our coins and call it quits at the first sign that things aren't perfect yet.

It's not an ad hominem attack to point out the shortcomings and poor judgement of the person manning the ship, I'd say those are very relevant facts, and a very good reason why people should keep their money out of BitReserve. I'm not going to bother going into a lengthy rebuttable, because you're clearly drinking the kool-aid, and I'd be willing to bet you're getting paid to drink the kool-aid. But soon people will see that the whole thing is a scam. BitReserve doesn't and never will pay money out of the reserves to holders of the "BitMoney", so the reserves are just for show. That's not a "crazy smart business model", it's foolish and shortsighted, and regardless of what registrations and approvals they have, it won't keep them from going under or the SEC realizing what a scam it is. Anyone investing in BitReserve will one day look back on their investment and realize how stupid and unnecessary BitReserve is. They're a middle man on new platform that doesn't need middle men.

Okay, this is a bit out there, but what about the idea of a union or alliance for people running a node? Users can specific a node network they'd like to broadcast their transactions through, and that union of nodes can work to relay transactions with fees only to miners who agree to pay out 10% of the transaction fee to those running a node. User's could specify priority, and if their transaction wasn't urgent within the hour, that's 6 different miners to negotiate with. It would be a fairly automated process, either the miner agrees or they don't, and if the priority of the user has been exceeded then the user's transaction would be broadcast regardless of the miner's willingness to comply. The fact you're dealing with multiple miners is leveraging the decentralized feature of Bitcoin the way it was meant to be used. The union would have the ability to refuse a miner a lot of money in fees that would likely be relayed to the miner of the next block instead. Does that make sense? Each miner only controls 10 minutes of transactions at a time, so unless a group of miners colluded and made it possible to block transactions for hours at a time, it is likely that at least one of those miners will accept that group of transactions and the associated fees. Users could be incentivized to participate by keeping track of fee-included transactions by users and offering a certain percentage of transactions with no fee, e.g., every 10th transaction is free.

How many people predicted we'd be where we are today? That should tell you all you need to know about the reliability of these so-called expert's guesses. 
You also have no idea how Bitcoin will be used, and if it is going to be used heavily as a medium of exchange and not a store of value, then as velocity of such transactions increases, the price will stagnate or go down. For all you know, we'll see a prolonged period of use cases like that before Bitcoin takes off as a store of value.

Not all miners are in it for the long term, mining equipment has an initial upfront investment and from then on it's all about ROI.

For the first few years, there was little you could do with Bitcoin besides buy drugs, but slowly we're seeing legitimate, mainstream options for Bitcoin that just can't be done via traditional payment methods.

I don't see how anything Mastercard does with P2P payments will be any different than what PayPal has tried to do. Mastercard will have to follow all the same laws, all the same KYC/AML processes, and will soon be just as popular with phishing scams and identity thieves as PayPal is. This is just a hail mary to keep from being sued by investors who could otherwise claim that Mastercard's executives didn't do enough to compete with Bitcoin and other emerging P2P payment technologies.

Why not put a chip in the nozzle and and chip in the gas tank; the car would know it's receiving gas and would pay accordingly. If the pump is running but it's not in the car that's supposed to pay, then the car won't pay. I suppose the car could still be siphoned after the fact, but even then the car could probably alert the owner that the gas tank is lower than the last time it was started.

This is a power grab. It's not about value in terms of dollars, it's about control. This money is putting control of resources in the hands of fewer and fewer people. When things go bust, which in dollar denominated value they probably will, the rich will still come out ahead. On paper they may be worth less in dollars, but they'll have more land, more stocks, and more scarce commodities than the rest of us, which will lead to even greater wealth disparity during the next boom. Rinse and repeat until the next revolution.

This isn't a case where the majority of miners working towards the long term benefit of Bitcoin prevents malicious use of the blockchain as it does with double spends. All it takes is one miner to abuse his ability to include bloat or spam and that block will end up in the blockchain forever. The miner of that block may not be a long term miner either, but once they accomplish their goal, they will still be able to cash out their block reward and sell their mining equipment.

That's what I would expect, and that makes a lot more sense. I'm fine trusting a company with 1 of 3 keys, that affords some much needed convenience. 
Ideally, I would also like to set limits for the fingerprint reader. Biometrics are not really secure either, and I wouldn't trust more than a few hundred dollars with my fingerprint. 
The idea of the company holding a backup is a cool idea though, but I'd like to see it implemented in a way that is similar to the lightning protocol, wherein I provide them with a partially signed time-locked transaction that I could sweep prior to it being accepted if it wasn't me who requested the transaction to be broadcast.

I am glad they fixed their mistake, and I am glad you got your bitcoin back, but this highlights some major obstacles that Bitcoin has to overcome: security and usability. Could Blockchain.info have afforded to reimburse their users if this happened to a million people overnight? I doubt it. This is one of the reasons I think some regulation and oversight of wallet providers is needed. We've seen BitGo and now Blockchain.info lose users funds through faulty code. If a software developer is going to release a wallet app that is in charge of creating addresses, then I think they should be insured against errors resulting from their faulty code. We can't expect the average user to take that risk themselves, and it's not safe to trust that the company in charge will do what's right every time, especially when the scale of losses goes up. It's unrealistic to think that we'll ever achieve mainstream usage when people run the risk of having funds disappear through no fault of their own. This is why we need more mature services that offer built in multi-sig and secure backups which make it impossible to wipe someone out by compromising just one private key.

With no block size limit, miners can use the blockchain to store data, spam, or other forms of blockchain bloat.

I'll keep saying what I have to say here regardless of whether the majority agree with my opinions or not, because I was also young and naive once, and I know the best medicine for naivety is a dose of reality. Fortunately, having an exciting alternative currency like Bitcoin is familiarizing a lot of people with the intricacies and corruption of the modern financial machine, and as mature adults, that knowledge will be key to a civilized financial revolution.

Your opinion is that people shouldn't tip unless it's an amount you think is reasonable and only to people you think are deserving. Having an opinion in general is not in bad taste, but having the opinion that people shouldn't be able to spend their money however they want is in bad taste. If it was meant to be promotional, so what? It wasn't your money, it wasn't to your account, and it doesn't involve you at all unless you choose to involve yourself. The difference between your opinion and one that is looking at this in a positive light, is that those looking at this in an apathetic or positive light aren't trying to tell these two private parties how to use their bitcoin. Do you honestly not see the difference?

That's a good idea there. Why not set a hard limit, like the 1MB/20MB limit for transactions that aren't required to include a fee, but then remove the limit completely as long as the sender is willing to pay an agreed upon fee? Though no limit still allows a miner to include their own spam at no cost, which will perpetuate in the blockchain; that idea obviously needs some tweaking to prevent that, but I think that's heading down the right path. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 03:30:28
Leveraging the usability of the blockchain as a negotiating chip is naive and short-sighted. I agree we need the issue resolved, but we also need to maintain the integrity of Bitcoin and ensure that it has 100% uptime and reasonable confirmation times. There's absolutely no excuse for playing politics with the blockchain. Anyone who understands the issue, understands Bitcoin can't serve the purpose it's meant to serve on a global scale with a 20MB block size limit, so if Bitcoin is going to succeed, it's a problem that has to be solved. Miners and users all have a vested interest in the network being scaled on a global level, so other than a few rogue miners with short term profits in mind, I don't think we'll have a problem reaching consensus. You can freak out about it and pretend like it's a bigger deal than it really is, but it's an issue that will be resolved. It may take time, and it may not be smooth going at every step along the way, but now that it's not an immediate concern, we can find a permanent solution that works to everyone's benefit. Look at where bandwidth, storage, and computing power are headed...we're not going to have a problem from a technical side at achieving everything that Bitcoin needs to achieve in order to serve as a global payment network.

I agree 100%, as I said in a comment below, it's only the extremely wealthy clients to whom the banks are lending cash at rates anywhere near the 0% mark that the Fed is offering to banks, so it makes perfect sense that they'd buy equities and real estate with those funds. Many of those same clients bought foreclosed houses in bulk from the banks during the housing meltdown, and now they're being given an opportunity to pull all their original cash investment out at near 0% interest. It's awfully clever, but a total load of horse shit, and if most Americans understood what was happening, they'd be up in arms.

Blocksize limit can have myriad of other implications on the system, so it's a little harder to test and implement in a scalable system. I agree it's the ideal solution for the long term, but I would rather have the block size limit raised in a simple manner like the 20MB raise, so we have plenty of time to reach consensus on exactly what the best algorithm is.

I do understand the myriad of mindsets at play, but if people are centralizing trust of the custody of their bitcoins to one individual, then they are foolish. It's completely unnecessary. If anyone can create a 3rd party medium for a bitcoin, such as the Cascacius Coin, then anyone accepting it should verify its value first. If you have the ability to verify it, then you have the ability to transfer it to a wallet under your sole control, or a multisig wallet that is more trusted than an unknown 3rd party. If someone wants to hold their bitcoin in Casascius Coins, so be it, but it's not wise. I agree that 3rd parties can add value, but in this case, that value is based on novelty, not security or increased utility. I think this is an important point to make so as to ensure that people don't assume a false sense of security regarding these coins and their future value.

Because it is easier to get people to agree to a 20MB increase while a well thought out method is developed. It doesn't make sense to arbitrarily set a percentage based increase because either option would not be a permanent fix. It is easier to test a 20MB block size and be sure that won't break anything than it is to institute auto-increases that haven't been thoroughly tested.

My hypothesis is that it's never going to pop. You see, it's only the 1% and above that have been given access to most of this new money that's been created at near 0% interest rates, and this is why we haven't seen massive inflation in the CPI yet. Rich people aren't going to buy more bread, milk, and eggs...they're going to buy stocks and real estate. This is the only real explanation, in my opinion, for why we've seen such a boom in real estate and equities despite most Americans still struggling financially. The rich people are using what is practically free money to gain further control over our limited resources and assets. It's exactly what I'd do if I was a multi-millionaire with access to a lot of free cash. It's bullshit and it's not flying under my radar. This is exactly why we need a currency free form government control. No one is offering me any of this new money, so what the fuck?

You're comparing your name to brands like Louis Vuitton, Cisco, or Marlboro which are clearly branded on bags, devices, and packaging which people look at multiple times a day. 
It's your prerogative to go after a niche market, and with so much competition in the retail space, that makes sense, but it's almost never advantageous to purposefully adopt a hard to remember name, especially if finding your company depends on being able to spell it. Ask a group unfamiliar with any brand how to spell Verizon or Prada and I bet they're correct more often than if they were asked to spell Novauri. Those two examples are at least easy to spell despite not being real words. 


I agree it sounds like a good service, and that's why I was trying to remember your name...so I could see what the status of the service was. Last time I checked it was still pre-beta, just taking sign-ups. You don't have to cater to 3rd graders, but I'm a well educated person who couldn't remember your name, and as a result, I forgot about it until I saw this post. Is it Novari, Novaris, Novauris, Novary, Nouvari, etc. I had it pretty close during a few of my googling attempts, but still no dice. 


"Only" is temporary; whatever great service you offer, there will be someone else to come along offering a similar service, and if I can remember their name off the top of my head, they're probably going to be the ones to get my business. So just distinguishing yourself based on your service, when you could have a superior service and memorable name seems like a poor business decision. Branding isn't just for retail.

If the intent of a block size limit is to protect the well-being of the network as a whole, i.e., prevent pollution of the common air, that's very different from regulating the block size for the purpose of creating artificial scarcity in order to create a more profitable fee market.

Amazon doesn't care if Prime is profitable right now, all they care about it getting more people to sign up and use it. There are people in rural Alaska taking advantage of 2-day Prime shipping and Amazon continues to allow it. They also allow you to ship to whatever address you want and receive 2-Day shipping. There is no rule against shipping gifts using Prime benefits and no one has yet to be told they can't use Prime benefits when sending a gift.

Plenty of hackers use automated code to look for any sign of a Bitcoin wallet or backup, so yes, that's really fucking naive. You say you're not worried now, but that is just dumb. Don't be dumb. If you're going to start investing in and holding bitcoin, then do it the right way or don't do it at all. Hackers are only going to get more sophisticated and their tools more advanced. You alone may not be worth the effort of targeting, but a couple hundred people like yourself make it worth while to write some code. If your private key is compromised, you're fucked. There is no recourse! Don't be foolish when it's completely unnecessary. A smart man learns from his mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. Learn from the mistakes of others and take the appropriate measures to secure your bitcoin.

Economics is an inexact science and I'm not making the argument that economists know everything, but they're much more qualified than a programmer when it comes to global economies and game theory. My point here is that we have people who are really only qualified to write code proposing changes based on their unqualified opinions on economics, and that is something I consider to be a problem.

I'm with you there, I don't think economists have all the answers, but if someone who studies economics and game theory on a professional level can't always get it right, then it's probably even less likely that a programmer with no background in the field of economics will get it right. 
There's no crystal ball here, and to some extent Bitcoin will be a trial-by-fire, but there's an old saying I like: "Only a fool learns from his own mistakes. The wise man learns from the mistakes of others." So while an economist can't always predict the future, someone with knowledge regarding the history of money and economics can certainly prevent missteps along the way. No one persons opinion should settle the debate though, but when it comes to our opinions on matters such as the block size, our opinions should be informed opinions.
@_date: 2015-07-05 20:21:07
Exactly. This isn't just about greed, though it's definitely a contributing factor. Sure, I'd love the price to skyrocket, but it also gives me joy to think about people in countries like Argentina and Venezuela where a decent number of people who currently hold bitcoin would benefit massively from increased adoption. This is a win-win opportunity that can bring stability to the financial lives of many underserved demographics. Poor people in 3rd world countries have probably never made a return on any sort of investment in their life, but now, for the first time, they can take part in an increasingly stable financial co-op without any permission from their government or banking system. We're not peddling snake oil here, this is a working system that offers real benefits to the people of the world. For me, Bitcoin isn't just about making money, it's about changing the world and setting humanity back on a course towards prosperity and opportunity for everyone.

When it comes to issues relating to computer science, they are at least somewhat qualified to give an opinion, and in those instances I do think their opinion is worth more than the average Bitcoin user. 
Regardless of whether their opinion is objectively worth more though, it's clear that many of these developers are in a position of influence when it comes to public opinion. 
I'm not trying to convince the developers of anything, what I want to see is users thinking critically about why a developer is proposing a certain change and whether that developer is qualified to be proposing such a change.

How feasible would it be to implement a requirement wherein each transaction does have a minimum fee of some sort and 50% of that fee goes to the miner of that current block, while the remaining 50% is distributed to the miners of the next 10 blocks or so?  Perhaps even scaled so the miner of the current block can include up to 10% of the current block's transactions for free, and only the transactions exceeding that will incur a fee to the miner. This would make it uneconomical for miner to fill up a block with garbage, as well as level the playing field among those who can mine large blocks vs those who can't.

Ideally, and this is just my opinion, a decentralized reddit should integrate with something like that Alexandria project. Allow the original content creator to upload their work, and then compare subsequent submissions to that database of content. That way the owner of the work is credited and paid for their work, while still allowing anyone to submit the work. A decentralized media library paired with a decentralized content aggregation and submission platform would be unstoppable.

If well intentioned and honest users are being lumped in with scammers, then your algorithm is shit. Apologies are only worth so much, and when this continues to happen, it's going to be no one's fault but Coinbase's when users migrate to a service that treats them like a respected customer instead of just another number in a database. Really starting to seem like Coinbase's business model is unsustainable and isn't properly designed to function in the real world.

A financial crisis that results in a revolution wherein the people move to a currency that isn't controlled by their governments whom have proven to do nothing but create hyper-inflation is a good thing. People are already starving and turning to violence, and I think you're being disingenuous by implying that the comment was referring to that aspect of a financial revolution as being fun. I don't think anyone else here but you took it that way, and an educated person would understand that having an option like Bitcoin would prevent a lot of those negative consequences. I think that was the point of the original comment. Bitcoin aims to end the cycle of hyper-inflation in these countries that just keep doing the same thing and reissuing a new currency with every new crisis. You know you're just being a dick by suggesting anyone here wants people to suffer; this whole idea of Bitcoin is about making things better.

That is the reality in many 3rd world countries with hyper-inflation.

That's a $210,000,000,000 market cap. It's taken 6 years for the value to get to were it is today, so what makes you think it won't take another ten or so years to increase the value nearly 100 fold? It's not really good for the long term prospect of Bitcoin for us to hit that valuation anytime soon either, as that would put most of the remaining coins in the hands of the miners. In about ten years, the mining reward will be about 1.5-3BTC per block, at which time a $10,000 price would make more sense. Saying it'll take another 10 years to hit $10,000 per coin is a lot less bold than saying we'll hit that mark within the next ten years. You're delusional if you're expecting it to come sooner.
