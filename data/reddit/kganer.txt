10,000 Bitcoins for Pizza's!
Look at the prices per year.
It looks like a engine starting, it fires then misfires fires but more firing now..
5 years ago it was \~$600 
And much less than 21 million people could own just one Bitcoin.

The owner (of Zapo) is not so bad as one may think.
Look him up: Wences_Casares on Wikipedia

" And I couldn't send money from California to Argentina, so I was trying to see if my sister, who is there, could give my friends some money; and I could pay her later. And one of my friends who is not tech-savvy or financially savvy, said, 'Hey, why don't you use Bitcoin?' And I said, 'What'? 'Bitcoin. Oh, I read about this digital currency where you can send money very easily.' So, I was curious and I looked up online; and I'm thinking crazily so I found someone who was willing to meet with me at a cafe in Palo Alto and gave me some bitcoin and I gave him the cash. And then I just got the bitcoin on my cellphone and I sent them to my friend in Argentina; and the next day he has sold them for pesos. And I just couldn't believe what happened. I was very skeptical at first but because of what I just saw happen, I began to research it, and the more I learned about it the more I was fascinated. And I felt like I was witnessing the beginning of the Internet, that kind of fascination"

This  will make the cryptocurrency more accessible to almost anyone, even in  places where data costs are high and living standards and incomes are  low. "

Now, U.S. Democrat Congressman Brad Sherman has urged his colleagues to  consider bitcoin and cryptocurrencies due to the  international financial power saying bitcoin needs to be in the bud.
Clearly he wants some Bitcoins! not sure about that bud.
