Ha you think the market cares what he thinks about stocks?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:24:49
That’s what futures are for. Coming Sunday night. On something like btc that snaps so much I wouldn’t use a stop market. I’ve seen people burned on that many times.

That’s different than him talking about stocks or companies he likes or doesn’t. Of course Mr Tarriff will affect the market with China tweets.

So these LN exchanges would be large financial institutions I suppose, they would be the only ones with enough capital to collateralize LN transfers?

IOTA is infinitely scalable.

That’s pretty funny all major banks allow you to move money to coinbase.

How can you tell the difference?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:21:27
You really want a stop on something that gaps 1k points?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:45:11
anyone know why BTC is over 16k, but on Binanace it shows 15k? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:44:03
Stops are not a good thing to use on a volatile product.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:29:25
gotcha thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:35:40
If it gaps down 5k you get out 5 k lower. If they have stops like futures(with protection) it turns into a limit order and you might not even get out. If you are actively trading why hold overnight? Makes no sense.

Then why use a stop?

Lol I've been in the financial industry for over 10 years, when shit gets really volitile even regular brokers/exchanges have problems. See Nasdaq launching facebook stock.

I got an email from my bitcoin excahnge/broker, they say they my coin will become Bitcoin and Bitcoin2x in the same amount that I have right now. Sounds slightly similar to a stock spinoff where I owned 1 company and now I own 2, and at the time they are valued the same as they did yesterday. So the chances are that regular bitcoin retains its value while bitcoin2x isnt worth anything?

Isn’t a crypto problem though? When was the last time someone hacked a bank and stole all the money?
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:28:39
I see so because there are so many miners now the difficulty is high. That makes sense thanks.
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:11:23
Yea I'm not really interested in mining myself, I was more asking about the theory of it. At some point if even the big boys aren't making money, wouldn't the whole market grind to a halt?
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:02:02
Any idea about the second part of my question? When even the big mining operations are not able to make money doing this?

There are many fundamental reasons I will not use bitcoin, but it really annoys me when people on reddit tell me how stupid I am for not wanting to buy them.  I try not to take that into account when discussing bitcoins, but its hard to forget that some moron who knows nothing about currencies aside from the end the fed movie he just watched is calling me dumb.
