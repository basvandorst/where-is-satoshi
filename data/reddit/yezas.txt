I'm learning a to do a web design logo creation something like that, but  I just started so my work is shit and not worth the money :)
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:03:24
Just wanna to share a site where you play csgo and earn some satoshi, and how can I spam reddit ?
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:41:06
And why mining is bad ? I don't need to make like 100 eu in week or day just some extra money for games or small things.
@_date: 2015-06-03 14:10:31
mining ? cloud mining is okey ? just started :)
@_date: 2015-06-07 14:44:15
In reddit. is there a subreddit ? And don't have money for adds, it is not my website
@_date: 2015-06-07 17:02:33
16 year old with back surgery yeah, and in my country 
@_date: 2015-06-03 17:05:30
Cloud mining I just don't use my tech no electricity nothing just renting :) I know that the income is smaller but you don't need an expensive tech 
@_date: 2015-05-24 23:24:03
Grammar nazi, here have my upvote, i see you need one 
@_date: 2015-05-26 13:18:22

@_date: 2015-05-24 20:18:07

Ty new few of them 
@_date: 2015-08-02 16:22:00
Looking forward to this site. The name is  try to look at it. Made some btc from there :) just by playing. The only feature the website is lacking is skin shop like yours. So yeah maybe it is a start of revolution in gaming :DDDD 
@_date: 2015-08-02 17:25:21
And one more thing have you put yourself in  ?
@_date: 2015-08-02 15:54:14
Nice and what about dota2 and tf2 items they also got a nice set of items especially tf2. And why the minimum sell price is 1 dollar ?
@_date: 2015-08-02 17:34:23
Yeah you can get more hate than support. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 08:21:50


@_date: 2015-08-02 16:36:44
np happy, to help 
@_date: 2015-08-25 17:12:23
Just try your birthday or any other family member bday :)
@_date: 2015-08-25 18:17:21
@_date: 2015-08-02 15:22:31
finally, I was looking for this so long. Do you accept Xapo wallet ? no restriction ?
@_date: 2015-08-03 08:21:00
Yeah, but the minimum sell price is 1 dollar for now I think so you will need a lot of cases :) 
@_date: 2015-08-02 17:33:45
Nice, write if you will find some interest with a leet.gg :)
@_date: 2015-08-02 16:08:16
Maybe delete the restriction for those who will make a lot of trades. And I know a website where you earn btc by playing csgo ? maybe you will find some interests ? 
@_date: 2015-08-04 20:14:40
Me again listed my shitty crates and skins for 1 dollar and sold it :) After accepting the trade offer I got instant payment :) Have you talked with leet.gg admins ?
@_date: 2015-08-13 13:16:10
Yeah I know this I tried to find it in there forums and main page, but nothing.
@_date: 2015-07-20 06:57:07
Still can't complete 60 sec ads 
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:41:50

@_date: 2015-08-02 17:24:59
Only shitposts and some other nonsense can get notice there, that subreddit is like cancer, but he can try. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 20:29:27
we will see :) and if you know, is it worldwide ?
@_date: 2015-08-03 08:24:53
One more thing I saw some "smart" people who list their 4 cent skins or cases for 1 dollar or more. I know that nobody will buy but still trash in list. So yeah that is one thing I noticed. Keep working
@_date: 2015-07-20 20:59:42
oh. ty for info
@_date: 2015-07-21 23:18:45
Nice site, looking forward to it :) you can only verify with jumio, no phone number verification ?
@_date: 2015-07-16 16:27:19
nice I noticed a bug, sometimes when you put the right numbers it doesn't count so you have do do it second time, most of the time it is 60 sec ads
@_date: 2015-07-17 18:38:46
yeah but keep the numbers  
@_date: 2015-07-20 20:03:38
And why it is so awesome ?
