Follow up: I contacted every single Coinbase reddit user and two of them replied, justin_coinbase and coinbase_josh. Basically, they proved me how it was not them who claimed my lost coins. My reply was if that was indeed true, then I should EITHER be allowed back into my account immediately OR there should be reimbursement contingent on this statement in their support web:
"All digital currency that Coinbase holds online is fully insured. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result.
The insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft."
If they think this is true (also from the same page): "This insurance policy does not cover any losses resulting from the compromise of your individual Coinbase account."
they need to allow me back into my own account IMMEDIATELY because it was caused by my own fault and not a security breach. I still have around 0.13BTC left in there which is worth around 950USD as of this second.
They told me it might take a few days to decide whether my account is safe for me to log into. I think they are BS-ing because what kind of experienced and professional team of developers take so long just to decide that lol even a 5-year-old kid who just learned about the internet can probably decide faster for me

I'll take that as a lesson then I guess. I really thought the wallets provided by exchanges are secure

Interestingly yes, I did have 2 factor enabled, but I guess anyone can hack into my google. I already changed my pass just in case anyone did

I see your point and I understand why. I now do strongly believe that either Coinbase or some hacker did it. I'm only 20 years old so losing more than 8000 dollars was kind of a pain in the ass

You should read up about other people getting their bitcoins stolen too from Coinbase. Although I couldn't justify whether who did it, put yourself in a position where you lost a lot of money and have no absolute access to it anymore.

Although Coinbase is an exchange, they do have a wallet built-in. Hearing your comment now makes me believe I might actually get my money back, thankyou!

I mentioned in the last paragraph that I am currently still locked out of my account. I don't know if I'm permanently blocked/locked out but I'd like to think I'm not

Sorry I had no idea, I just started buying bitcoins around 2 weeks ago. The idea of holding it with a private key is if one wants to go long term no? I wanted my btcs to be available for me (at gdax) anytime just in the case I want to buy or sell against usd
