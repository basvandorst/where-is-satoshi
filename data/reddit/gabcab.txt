Best part is, you could put a private key on there and make it an actual Bitcoin!

So that means the price rises when the moon is on the opposite side of the planet, and goes up when it's in the sky? Explains the bumpiness

Not to sound naive or anything, but isn't the most quoted previous all time high (266) based on the Mtgox price as well, and therefore it makes sense to either compare it to Mtgox, or to use another exchange for both today's value and the previous ATH?

Well thank you, didn't even notice!  Better post a cat or something on r/pics

I'd pay off my debts and buy some property, then keep the rest in BTC until I need to use it
@_date: 2013-04-08 07:21:49
We hit 175!  WOOOOOO

Subscribed! Hope to see my dad's new Maryland/DC cleaning company up there soon, he's warming up to the idea of accepting BTC.
