Easy, no. But when you’re as heavily capitalized as bitmain, quite doable.
Thousands of their S9s have already left China. Good for “decentralization”... although to some extent so much hashpower is still bitmain “centralized.”

Whether or not China actually cracks down or not idk... but it is a fact that bitmain has/is setting up massive operations in NA.

Bitmain has already made massive movements out of China. This didn’t catch them by surprise... they just set up shop elsewhere.

Because random 2day stranger just wants to protect you, because he cares for you and your financial health so much.

For all those saying the loans are short term and get paid back, don't forget that the Fed's balance sheet has grown &gt;250B dollars in 8-9 weeks. This is not all getting paid back, and the balance sheet rate of growth right now is ridiculous.

I bought an HW.1 and a digital bitbox from "king paradise"/ Confirmation and shipping was fast. They're back ordered on the Nano S though just like everyone else. Got one of those from a reseller off eBay, albeit at a significant markup.

Just a guy on the other side of the coin. Casey's a gold guy. Understands the issues with fiat, just supports a different alternative. Wants something with "intrinsic" value (whatever that means, I think it's subjective) but doesn't address gold's fungibility, transport, and divisibility issues, especially in a global economy.

he shouldn't even be relevant, honestly.

Agreed. They can't just ignore it anymore... still a lot of uncertainty for BTC's future though imo

Been pretty much a straight rise since then. Already back over $3700. Dang maybe I should just follow this guy's twitter feed to know when to buy the dip XD
@_date: 2017-09-22 15:21:20
heard of it several years back but thought it was silly then, plus I was broke. Wish I'd thought differently then.

Do it on steemit. At least you'll get tokens.

Confirmation bias. We all do it. Have to find reasons to justify not getting in several years ago when BTC was even greener. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:36:52
Yeah, say you put in $1000, and bank is only require to keep 10% on hand, loans out $900; that money ends up in a bank, bank loans out $810, ad infinitum. It is essentially money from thin air, since only $1000 existed initially. If there's ever a run on the bank... money in existence can't cover the demand.

100k addl Coinbase sign ups make that hard to believe, people would go through that hassle just to spectate. But maybe that's why I'm not rich lol
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:18:21
The inner conflict of having some and wanting it to go up, vs. wanting it to go down and buy more. Ugh.
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:40:14
Of course you're right, but the selfish part of me that wants to earn in percentages and multiples of my investment wants the lowest price possible. Diminishing ROR as I go in at higher prices. But maybe my mentality is still messed up because I keep thinking of BTC in terms of USD... dang that will take a mindshift to truly think of BTC as a currency instead of a speculation, but I'm working on it!

Hopefully the very threat of Chinese miners being co-opted will incentivize miners from other countries to increase their hashrate, due to a possible drop in global hashrate and a chance to increase their percentage share.

makes one wonder whether the money will flow straight in or they'll try to give it a couple of hard knocks again first
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:58:23
The saddest part to me about this whole thing is that if in fact he did influence the BTC market, it's only because people for some reason still give a damn about what parasite skimmers like him have to say. He's not in it for you, me, or anybody else. They've been throwing their weight around and copping money from suckers from the beginning.

Pretty much sums up media stories the entire year.
