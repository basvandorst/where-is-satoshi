I use Stripe to process payments on my website, and while I was aware you could accept Bitcoin via Stripe, they never really promoted it to Stripe merchants or made it easy to do so. In fact, if I wasn't interested in Bitcoin already, I doubt I would have known that Stripe even had the functionality! They were never really behind it from the start.

It obviously won't kill all alts as there are some decent coins out there with good real-world use cases.
But if lightning is successful and gets a high adoption rate, then I'm sure a lot of altcoins would drop in usage/price and/or go out of existence.
It's a big if, though.

Just out of interest, where in Argentina are you planning on buying a house for around US$70,000? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:39:28
It would be cheap for the city of Buenos Aires. But this is in a small place a little way outside of the city.
I have no idea about house prices across Argentina in general. I think it's probably cheap in some places (i.e. major cities like Buenos Aires, Rosario, Mendoza), and about normal in other (generally considered less desirable) areas.

What if you save your (taxed) fiat wages to make big purchases with (like that brand new car), and use your crypto to cash out small amounts daily or weekly either with other individuals paying you fiat-cash for it, or by using a crypto-funded debit card, and then use that crypto-to-fiat-cash for your day to day living costs, freeing you up to save most or all of your (taxed) fiat wages for the bigger purchases every so often?

@_date: 2015-05-02 12:20:01
Wow, you got a pretty sweet deal there. Did you find it through personal contacts/word of mouth, or some other channel?
Most foreigners I know (and some Argentines) are paying more to rent a room than you and your friend are paying for a whole apartment. And not all of them are even in Palermo.
I lived in Buenos Aires for over 9 years and had some pretty good deals over the years, but never quite as good as you mention, and also I always had to rent for at least a year, usually 2 years, to get a decent deal. Now I just visit BA every year or two for between 3 and 9 months, and it's a lot more difficult to find good deals under such circumstances. Maybe I'm not smart enough? ;-)
@_date: 2015-05-05 23:12:39
Thanks for the update. Yeah, I've had 4 different apartments with 2 year contracts. The problem is now that I'm returning every so often for shorter periods and need to rent for 3 to 9 months :-/

It's funny to me, thinking about $850 being "early". I got in at around that price too (high five!), and at that point I felt like I had waited far too long.
And it's entirely possible that people now feeling like $8000 is too late will also later look back at this as getting in "early", further down the line.

Again, it's beta, and clearly announced as such. You think that a lot of random punters are just wandering into the Lightning mainnet and losing money?
Beta releases are for when something is feature complete but likely to contain bugs. 
You're focusing on a really small present "issue", which is just a distraction tactic.
Just wait and see. Adoption is tiny, there is no rush, it may get there in the end, it may not. I believe it will, you clearly don't. Have a nice day.

Adoption is tiny at the moment. There is plenty of time.
And you are clearly not open-minded in regards to BTC and 2nd layer solutions, because you have arbitrarily decided that they are taking too long and that we'll "all be dead" before they become useful. Which is just ridiculous hyperbole.
But yes, we definitely should be open to different outcomes and not put all of our eggs in the BTC basket. On that subject I'm sure we have at least some common ground.

If all coins started over now with no volume, it would be impossible to say, because no other coin has proved that it can scale (and certainly no other coin has proved it can scale while remaining decentralized and secure).
Bitcoin has had scaling problems, but it has a 2nd layer solution in Lightning, and it will live and die on how well that does. If it is a success in the next couple of years, we may never find out the answer to whether other coins can scale successfully, because they might never get enough traction to need to scale, but that won't stop people banging on about how cheap and fast they are (which isn't impressive at all when few people are using them).

Speaking as someone who has taught Philosophy myself in the past, the idea that I, or any other professor, would use a qualification to try to win or back-up an argument is ridiculous and to be honest, a little dangerous.

In your original post you were not vague with your timing prediction (on Thursday, you said it would go over 7000 on Friday).
If timing is vague, why bother making time-based predictions? You come across as arrogant and then when you're wrong, you look for excuses rather than just saying you were wrong, making you seem even more arrogant.

For example, with me it has changed my life by allowing me to quickly, safely and cheaply transfer money in and out of a country that has been in a really messed up economic situation in recent years (Argentina).
Either way, I read back some of your post history and you don't come across as someone who is trying to help people avoid mistakes. To me you come across as a jerk who isn't particularly informed about Bitcoin (calling it a pyramid scheme, for a start). And no one would say they are trying to help people avoid mistakes, but then describe themself as a disaster tourist.

Thanks for the reply, but sorry, not sure what you mean by "refunds may come in"?
If I am buying Bitcoins with my Stripe balance transfer to a US bank account, how can there be a refund?

You're in the wrong subreddit I think
@_date: 2015-03-17 05:50:11
Thanks, but I always have several thousands of dollars as a buffer in Stripe, so that won't be a problem :-) I also very, very rarely have to give out refunds, and have never had a chargeback in 9 years of business.
edit: I'm looking into Bitwage but I don't yet see how I can use it to buy Bitcoin. Isn't it meant as a payroll system? How do I use Bitwage to find people to buy Bitcoin from with my Stripe balance?

A stopped clock is right twice a day!

Maybe, but in this case I need it instantly, I don't want to sit on the bitcoin, instead I am using it to get money into Argentina (buying pesos at the blue rate). Although I'm not in Argentina... long story.

Weird, I guess they have different limits for different accounts.
@_date: 2015-02-27 16:24:32
Thanks, will check them out!
edit: Wait, Bittylicious looks like it's only for the UK/EU?

I'm not sure they do what I want either. I want to buy Bitcoin directly with funds from my US account, but I am not in the US. I don't want to withdraw from, or send the money to, elsewhere first (i.e. wherever I am traveling) as that will incur fees or currency conversion losses.
@_date: 2015-02-27 16:40:50
Perhaps I should ask this in instead? Only just noticed that sub.
@_date: 2015-03-17 06:34:25
No worries. Cheers for the suggestion!
@_date: 2015-02-27 16:57:27
Thanks. Do you know if that wait would typically be more or less than 3 days?
@_date: 2015-03-17 05:54:59
Thanks. But how do I find the people to buy Bitcoin from in that way in the first place? I've been searching the Local Bitcoins website today and can't seem to find anyone who mentions accepting something like this.

I know people that give me USD cash for BTC in Buenos Aires, in fact it’s the only place I’ve done it. Found through friends of friends etc. But perhaps harder to find in the rest of Argentina.

As Vice President? ;-)
@_date: 2015-02-27 16:24:05
They actually are giving me a 2500 a week limit, but each day that I log in and try to buy Bitcoin, only 100 dollars is instantly added, and the rest has to wait 3 to 5 days.

Coinbase will only let me have a UK account, as right now I am not a US resident (and I am not a US citizen), though I do have a US bank account, which is where I want to fund things from to avoid losing money in currency exchange.
Actually, ideally, I would fund things directly from my US Stripe account (which can transfer to any bank account in the US at a cost of 25 cents), but I'm not sure how to achieve that.

Macri has always been incompetent and from a corrupt family, he was never going to stop any madness. He’s also passed unconstitutional laws in regards to immigration.

Predictions for dollar-peso exchange rate at the end of this year?
Hard to say I know with the elections coming up and not knowing who will win, but anyway... thoughts?
Is the average person who can save doing so in USD cash, or is saving in crypto a thing?

Thanks for the info. I'll probably be back in Buenos Aires for a month or so in early 2020. I'm wondering what kind of situation will be awaiting me. But I'm feeling lucky that it's just for a visit and that I don't work there anymore, as shitty as that might sound (I lived and worked in BA from 2005 to 2015).
