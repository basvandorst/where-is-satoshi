The federal law doesn't make a moral judgment. 
Sales of banned narcotics across statelines is a instant go-to-jail card. This is no different than any one else who got caught selling.

The guy wasn't a mastermind. He was a grad student from aspie schools with no real street smarts. He was naive white kid. Had no real world experience to speak of. That's where danger is. If you don't understand how institutions and people operate (in real life) getting caught is far more likely because you can't anticipate what they will do (or not do in some cases).

TOR is and has been compromised for a long time. Its never been safe to do any kind of illegal money changing on there.

Even the Laughing Man got caught eventually.

Its VERY likely. They pleaded out and gave up people for reduction in sentence. Its very common.

I know people I contacted today at Peterson AFB weren't there.

Hm. Depends on how much public pressure and politics are involved.

Yup. But quiet honestly. This is a very narrow technology that isn't used by the vast majority of the population.

Sure there's always a "chance." But from what I've seen the evidence is overwhelming. If they don't get him on SR, they got him on all sorts of other charges. Even something as innocuous as fake ids. 
I can't say what kind of deal they would offer. But I'm sure it will require him to turn over any information he might have about partners or collaborators. Any/all information on dealers. He may even have to serve as a witness in other prosecutions. Its all dependant on the facts of the case and the rigorousness of the investigation at this point. But the AG will make that determination after his arraignment most likely. 
How bad? Hard to say. I would think he's swimming up shit creek without a paddle. Since he has no real assets, getting a real attorney might be tough. Rumor is he has a public defender. Probably not a good start.

Trial Attorney here. 
No offense, but you don't know what in the fuck your talking about. This probably won't go to trial. He will plead out for a reduced sentence once he spills the beans on everyone/everything involved in SR. The gov't has been collecting data on him for a long time. Trust me, they have a case. They would not risk embarrassment after all the recent hooha around Edward Snowden and the NSA. This is an easy victory for them.
