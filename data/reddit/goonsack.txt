This got me thinking... is there a possible mechanism by which a continuous 'straw polling' could be built into bitcoin mining? A period of straw polling could be an easy and safe way to signal the intent of miners before any possible hard fork was considered. I understand that custom data can be placed in block headers, so perhaps this could be developed into a polling mechanism for bitcoin miners.

I thank you for your kind recommendation. I have indeed been perusing through the criminal complaint over the course of our dialogue.


Admittedly I did not see the part before about the informant mentioning 'coke' in a message to Faiella regarding a bitcoin purchase. Still, it seems a bit tenuous to me, with no apparent verbal acknowledgement of this statement by Faiella, aside from him initiating the transfer. Plus, it still seems like whether or not this was a criminal act rests upon whether or not Faiella was truly a "money transmitting business" as defined under 31 USC § 5330. If he was, then yes, it seems like it would be his duty under the law to take notice of the informant's statement and not proceed. If not, then I believe it's kind of his call if he wants just ignore it and say "not my concern what he does with his bitcoins". I'm trying to think of a good analogy here. For instance, what if I was cashing in a winning lottery ticket for $3000 at a gas station and just as the cashier was about to hand me the money, I say, "Woo! Looks like I'm having a coke party at my place!". Would the cashier be legally bound to refuse the transaction? Would it even seem productive for him to do so, given that I could just take it to the gas station across the street and not mention anything shady?


On to the money laundering charge. You bring up an interesting aspect here, but I don't think it proves your point. The criminal charge invokes the money laundering statute [18 USC 1956]( This statue defines this crime as:
* Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the **proceeds of some form of unlawful activity**, conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction **which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity**—
So this goes back to what I was saying before about how money laundering does need to involve transferring ill-gotten funds. In the case of Faiella, he was simply swapping dollars belonging to an alleged drug-seeker with the bitcoins provided by an exchange company (BitInstant). There's no reason to believe that either end of the transactions were proceeds from crime.
As for your claim that "knowing that a transaction is designed at least in part to avoid a reporting requirement is part of the definition of money laundering", I think you are referring to Shrem's alleged advice to Faiella to break up his BitInstant buys into smaller transactions under separate emails. This type of behaviour is governed by a separate statute called structuring, and is indictable under [31 USC 5324]( It is a separate crime.
Although 18 USC 1956 does make reference to "avoid[ing] a transaction reporting requirement under State or Federal law", (which I assume is what you were talking about) it is always in the context of a "transfer represent[ing] the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity".
However, there remains one way in which structuring, or failure to report could be seen as a 18 USC 1956 violation. This is because 18 USC 1956 (2)(A) includes :
* Whoever...transmits...with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity 
Structuring *would* be an unlawful activity. 
But then, when "specified unlawful activity" is defined in 18 USC 1956 (7), we see that it means:
* any act or activity constituting an offense listed in section 1961 (1) of this title except an act which is indictable under subchapter II of chapter [53 of title 31](
As structuring (31 USC 5324) and other failure to report and circumvention to report crimes are in that subchapter, it means (if I'm reading it correctly) that they are specifically exempted from triggering 18 USC 1956 (2)(A). Presumably because such crimes are already indictable under these ancillary AML laws, so there's no need to have legal recursion back onto 18 USC 1956.


I'm still not seeing damning evidence in these pages that the dollars and bitcoins exchanged by Faiella and Shrem were criminal proceeds. The "coke" message incident seems like potentially the worst thing in there. I discussed that previously. And it still does not mean that the bitcoins transferred to the informant, or the dollars transferred to Faiella in the course of this represented "the proceeds of specified unlawful activity".
Further, a desire on Faiella's part to be more private or 'stealthy' with his business, or to retain financial privacy, does not necessarily mean he was committing crimes-- though if he was, this fact could bolster a *mens rea* claim against him.
Similarly, the fact that Faiella suspected himself to be possibly operating an unlicensed money transmission business does not prove that he was. Whether or not he was in violation of 18 USC § 1960 is defined statutorily, not based on his personal opinion on the matter. Again, these arguments only serve to bolster a *mens rea* claim against Faiella, should he indeed be in violation of the statute.
As an interesting side note: owing to the Patriot Act, there actually is no longer a *mens rea* requirement associated with 18 USC § 1960. See [here]( for further reading.


I don't believe this is the applicable definition in this instance. The criminal complaint references [18 USC 1960]( - "PROHIBITION OF UNLICENSED MONEY TRANSMITTING BUSINESSES". For the purposes of 18 USC 1960, MTBs are defined by way of [31 USC § 5330]( which is "REGISTRATION OF MONEY TRANSMITTING BUSINESSES". And reading 31 USC § 5330 (d)(1)(A) and (d)(1)(B) we see :
* Definitions.— For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply: ... Money transmitting business.— The term “money transmitting business” means any business other than the United States Postal Service which ... provides ... currency exchange, or money transmitting or remittance services, or issues or redeems money orders, travelers’ checks, and other similar instruments or any other person who engages as a business in the transmission of funds, including any person who engages as a business in an informal money transfer system or any network of people who engage as a business in facilitating the transfer of money domestically or internationally outside of the conventional financial institutions system;; [and] ... is required to file reports under section 5313
So, in 31 USC § 5330, "Money transmitting business" is internally defined, and not reliant upon the definition you provided in [31 CFR 1010.100]( 31 USC § 5330 doesn't reference 31 CFR 1010.100, nor is the reverse true. Additionally, 18 USC 1960 does not reference 31 CFR 1010.100.
Additionally, it seems the definitions of "Money transmitting business" as defined by 31 USC § 5330 are more narrow than that found in 31 CFR 1010.100. So it's less of a sure thing that Faiella or Shrem would qualify.
Then again, there is the issue of the FinCEN guidance-- which is somewhat more clear-cut than interpreting the statutes themselves (although still quite murky). But as I have said before, it's never actual withstood a legal test.


I think it was in an effort to make damn certain that they were compliant (even if an a priori reading of the statutes in question yields uncertain conclusions) and in an effort to perform due diligence. And yes, probably at the recommendation of lawyers. Ironically, even though he preempted FinCEN, Shrem is *still* being charged retroactively (in Count Two) with failing to register BitInstant before he did (operating 12/11 - 10/12). In further irony, had Shrem not registered, then USC § 5318(g) might not have stuck.


Right, I think we agree here. The drug connection seems to be what the money laundering (18 USC 1956) charges hinge on. 18 USC 1960 and 31 USC § 5318(g) would not appear to rely on it.
So I don't know, I'm still not buying the criminal complaint as a whole. It seems to have a lot of loose ends. Once you start pulling, parts of it seem to unravel. I think it's still quite possible the government is overstepping its statutory authority in this case. Not that I have much confidence that we'll see it go to court, or that a real legal challenge be mounted. Being threatened with daunting penalties as they are, these dudes will probably just plea out.

I'll take a whack at it.
3 billion bases in a human haploid genome. But humans are diploid (one copy of each chromosome from dad, one from mom). So that means 6 billion bases total if all the 26 chromosomes are laid end to end.
For a given position on the genome, you need 2 bits to represent a base (since there are 4 bases). For example: 00=adenine, 01=cytosine, 10=guanine, 11=thymine.
However, humans are 99.9% genetically similar to one another. So, if we choose one genome sequence as the 'reference genome' to which all others are compared, we can significantly compress the data needed.
That means there are 6 million discrepancies, on average, to the reference genome. If each base is represented by 2 bits, that means we get it down to 1.5 MB!
But wait, we're not out of the woods yet. Because we actually need to encode, somehow, where these discrepancies (a.k.a. polymorphisms) lie in the genome.
I don't know much about data compression, but it seems to me the best strategy for referencing locational info is just to encode the 'gap size' between each polymorphism. So the data structure would alternate predictably between [2 bits encoding base] and [? bits encoding gap].
Now to make a good data structure with minimal information needed, we ought to know the distribution of distances between polymorphisms. [I found one here]( Due to clustering of polymorphisms (hotspots for genetic variation in the genome) the typical distance is actually less than one would expect simply by dividing the total bases (6 billion) by the number of discrepancies (6 million).
It looks like from that graph we have:
    25% within 1-25 bases
    13% within 26-50 bases
    10% within 51-75 bases
    8% within 76-100 bases
    6% within 101-125 bases
    5% within 126-150 bases
    4% within 151-175 bases
    3% within 176-200 bases
    2% within 201-225 bases
    2% within 226-250 bases
    2% within 251-275 bases
    1% within 276-300 bases
    ∴ 19% &gt;301 bases
To save bits, we can bin gaps into different size categories, and can reserve the first two bits of each gap code to specify which one. For example: 00 = 5 bit number (1 to 32 base gap) which covers ~33% of gaps (I'm estimating), 01 = 8 bit number (33 to 288 base gap) which covers an additional ~50% of gaps, 10 = 10 bit number (289 to 1312 base gap) which covers maybe another ~11% of gaps, and then 11 = 20 bit number (for up to about a million base gap) which ought to cover the remaining 6% of gaps. We would reserve two of these 20 bit numbers to represent indel type polymorphisms (insertions/deletions), which would set off the inclusion of additional data to specify the details needed for the 'compiler' to recapitulate these polymorphisms when looking at the reference genome (For simplicity I'll neglect indel data structures in my estimate below).
So with this rough compression scheme, and according to my assumptions, we have:
    6 million polymorphisms * (2 bits) = 12 million bits
Then for our different gaps:
    6 million gaps * (0.33) * (7 bits) = 14 million bits
    6 million gaps * (0.50) * (10 bits) = 30 million bits
    6 million gaps * (.11) * (12 bits) = 8 million bits
    6 million gaps * (.06) * (22 bits) = 8 million bits
Total is 72 million bits, or 9 MB.
I'm sure there are better compression tricks or optimizations that could make it even smaller though.

Right, the blockchain can be used for attestation that one has an 'official' copy even though it is just data. So there is artificial scarcity of digital goods enforced as long as some kind of application layer built on top of the protocol can interpret and enforce it.

I think it's imperative that government officials start moving away from the paranoid, post-9/11 'trade-liberty-for-safety' mindset. Which is still so prevalent. Doubling down on this approach is more of a threat to the nation's well-being than terrorism ever was.

It doesn't work like that exactly. The assets can be seized if a judge signs off on it. It's a civil matter, so the burden of proof is lower (more than 50% likely, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt). Further, it is the property itself that is charged with a crime. If no one comes forth to fight for it (the costs of which often exceed the value of the asset in question), then it is automatically forfeit.

For anyone confused by OP title:
As I understand it, Davi was flying out of Manchester, NH airport after attending Liberty Forum.
Having items of clothing featuring bitcoin logo, apparently tipped off TSA or other airport law enforcement that Davi *could* be trying to transport large amounts of bitcoin through the air transport system (I know, sounds ridiculous, but then again, that's airport security for you).
The issue they were likely to be concerned with is that it is currently a felony to transport more than 10,000 USD (or an equivalent value) out of the country without declaring it.
Sounds like it all blew over as soon as it was clarified that Davi was not traveling internationally.
But it does seem like a pretty freaky ordeal that wearing a bitcoin logo can single a person out for harassment.
EDIT: The most insane part of this is that unless Davi was carrying physical bitcoins, there would be no way to even know, or stop him from, taking &gt;10,000 USD of value across borders. So it's weird that the TSA would be trying to enforce such a thing. Having a private key controlling that much value on a smartphone or laptop, or having a brainwallet in your cortex, it's not like they can stop that. Laughable.

All the claims about Mt Gox's insolvency just seems like a lot of Groupthink to me. I'm still having trouble coming up with a likely situation in which they become insolvent. They made a *lot* of money. And they've been continuing to make money. Sure, they've lost some along the way, to US government privateering, and probably some more to exploiters of the malleability issue. But I think they could have hemorrhaged a lot of money and still been doing incredibly well, much less remain solvent.

You're absolutely right. And a lot of people seem to have a misconception about this. The charges have nothing to do with the "I'm going to do bad stuff" statements buy the fake buyer. Its quite dubious in fact that this in itself is illegal. It's unwise, sure, because you could potentially be opening yourself up to criminal/civil liability down the line. But it's not illegal on its face... otherwise they would have charged him with that instead of the actual charges (which dealt with failure to perform AML/KYC/MSB registration duties when making transactions that hit a certain reporting threshold).
These stories are nothing but little anecdotes that are designed to smear the defendant's name. For the judge, the juries, and also (I would add) to make them out to be bad guys in the media and to the general public at large.
EDIT: It's a little more complex than I originally thought. 
Looking at the affidavits, I think there actually may be a case for money laundering under [this Florida statute]( at least in Reid's case (but not for Espinoza's). There were some details I had missed previously. (hat tip to The most damning part of the affidavit is that the defendant (Reid) wasn't solely told by the informant that the money *would be used in the future* for CC fraud, but also that some of the money exchanged previously had been the proceeds of such crime:

Right. Well merge-mining is indeed what they're proposing. Which may mitigate the chance of a 51% (assuming the incentives for bitcoin miners to merge-mine the sidechains is good enough).
 I guess my question is, do you think would it be practicable to merge-mine on, say 64 chains at once? Using that example, I guess it would add 63 additional hashing steps into generating a merkle tree for each workunit sent out by the pool operator. Since the operator only has to do this once for each workunit, and doesn't have to send out the workunits all the time, my inclination would be that it wouldn't impact efficiency too much. But I don't really know.
I guess merge-mining on chains with vastly different block targets would certainly be an issue though. Like, they proposed a new sidechain for HFT, which would require a really fast block target presumably. How does one efficiently merge-mine that I wonder?

Having lost a loved one to ALS, I can confirm it is a truly awful disease. Even having seen it play out, it's still difficult for me to imagine what it would be like to go through that experience. It's inspiring that Hal has persevered for this long in spite of being so debilitated by the disease.
I'm really glad that this interview was able to take place. It's crazy that this is a guy whose life is sustained by machines, and is communicating about a decentralized electronic currency via a computer, optical mouse, and voice synthesizer.

The story of Hal's involvement in bitcoin is so cool. I loved reading his [BCT post]( where he talks about it.

I don't think this is truly a bulletproof case, OP. 
But it doesn't fucking matter anymore.
Because what I just came to realize, is that either way, this isn't going to end well. Either way, lots of people are going to be really fucking pissed at Mt Gox.
If Mt Gox is insolvent, obviously it's unlikely that people will be made whole. Some may have recouped funds by getting out early (i.e. selling GoxBTC for BTC at a discount). Some may have improved their chances of renumeration by cashing out GoxBTC for fiat (I still don't know if this strategy has solid legal foundations or not). But there will be bagholders. Lots of them.
On the other hand, if Gox turns out to be solvent, then a sizable amount of people are still going to be pissed. Because it seems like lots of folks are making financial decisions fueled by all the rumors, speculation, and FUD that is rampant on this subreddit and elsewhere. People will blame Gox for their misguided actions (selling at a discount) when in reality it will be largely their own fault. Gox didn't force you to sell. You did it of your own accord. Based on shaky evidence.
Either way, it's a clusterfuck.

Thanks for the response. 
I guess I'm still a little confused about how the network rules can enforce the give-to-get incentive that you will want the system to be based on. You don't want the system to be plagued by the free rider problem. Too many freeloaders and the system would be impractical, as there's now not enough storage space being contributed for all the storage space being utilized.
If I'm understanding you correctly (please correct me if not) it seems like a self-interested actor who wanted free (free as in they don't have to reciprocate) storage could run the maidsafe client once, allocating a 1.3TB vault, say, and then they'd be given the ability to broadcast 1TB or so of their own data to the network for distributed storage. But then they can simply turn off the client, and erase the vault on their hard drive, and from that point on contribute nothing. In so doing, they'd essentially be burdening the network with an additional 1.3TB of user data that they had been storing on the vault, since all this data would have to be reduplicated onto other vaults at some point after that client disconnects. However, their data stored on the network would still be intact, and ready for retrieval if they ever fired up their client again. Is this correct?
Also I am curious, if I am running a vault and my connection is interrupted, how long before my vault data is reduplicated into other vaults to assure the desired level of redundancy? Would a disconnect time incurred by simply restarting my computer or router be sufficient to trigger this happening?
Sorry for a zillion questions. I hope I'm not cutting into your coding time too much!
@_date: 2014-01-04 11:02:45


For real? A) I refuse to believe it is 'minimally complex'. The income tax code in the US is a byzantine, phantasmagorical gemisch, with each passing year bringing more layers of complexity. No one living person has a full grasp of it. It is horribly complex. Most people in government would cop to that as well. The tax code would have been simplified and reformed by now were it not for countervailing lobbying forces (the middlemen who skim money off of tax code complexity - e.g. Intuit, or the fucking OP here). B) The system isn't even fair. If you are rich and well-connected enough, you can get special legal loopholes written in the tax code for you. Which only adds to the complexity. 
I agree it would be awesome to have an anarcho-capitalist and/or panarchist experiment somewhere. At the very least there should be more competition for the providing of government-type services. As it stands, most nation states are just becoming giant corrals and the people are just livestock for the political classes to get fat on. There's a huge barrier to simply voting with one's feet due to restrictive borders.
Wouldn't it be cool to have one geographical location with a wide variety of competing legal/governmental/political jurisdictions all within biking distance of one another? It would be awesome I think. Competitive governance is something I'd be way into.

SharedCoin (the blockchain.info CoinJoin implementation) is the only privacy tool offered by that site now.
There used to be something called Shared Send, which was an actual taintless bitcoin mixer and not just a CoinJoin plausible-deniability transaction obfuscator. 
For a while, Shared Send was the only option. Then SharedCoin was introduced and for a while they were both available in the blockchain.info wallet.
Then, Shared Send was discontinued. Even the old URL for Shared Send ( redirects to their SharedCoin page now.
That decision kind of struck me as weird. Do you think they felt like operating the Shared Send mixer might put them in legal hot water?

The fucked up thing, is that taxes no longer actually fund the government. They have the power now to create new money more or less at will by monetizing debt (now that we're off specie standard). Taxes only serve to offset the newly created money by destroying some of the existing money. So in this sense tax evasion has limited utility as a way to 'starve' the government. In order for the system to be brought down, the US dollar itself would have to be undermined. The only way for this to happen would be a speculative attack, or a massive loss of confidence in the dollar and dollar-denominated treasury securities.

Great post - I share your concerns there. You expressed it more eloquently than I could.
Perhaps bitcoin getting sort of co-opted by big money and power always was somewhat inevitable.
But what does give me hope is that bitcoin will always especially lend itself to 'Systeme D', the grey market economy, just like cash does. 
And, now that cryptocurrency technology is out of the bag, and still on a tear, there will probably never be any shortage of new tools for countereconomic activity.
As for bitcoin, whatever it becomes, I think it will still be a leap forward and will be a benefit to humanity.

Sure, but I've been here for quite a while. If that account has seen a substantial change in tone I think I would have noticed. And in my memory it's been pretty consistent.
That account certainly seems trollish and provocative at times. But I will tend to defend trolling if it's well-executed.
I see it as a checks and balances sort of thing, as somewhat alludes to. The troll, or jester, if you want to invoke a more ancient archetype, is a sacred sort of role.
Should majority opinion congeal too hastily, I think dissenting in a humourous sort of way can help to moderate discussions. But it must strike a fine balance as well. 
I simply wished to convey that using my voting history as a crude proxy, I think comes at least close to striking such a balance.

I see. So If I'm understanding correctly, the resource- or rate-limiting step for merge-mining is not actually constructing more merkle trees (one for each txn collection of each chain), and then merkle trees of those merkle trees...
But it's actually listening for new block or transaction broadcasts on each network, and processing/validating the transactions for either discarding, or rebroadcast and incorporation into said blocks? I imagine that would get a bit hairy with 64 full nodes running at once.

I guess it's possible that he has access to more bitcoin sure. The prosecution does make that argument in their motion to deny bail. 
I think the point here though is that the bail bond that was offered up was over a million dollars worth of other people's money. From like ~15 of his friends and family. Including equity in his parents' home. So I still think it would be unlikely he'd flee and allow all those assets to be forfeited. 
Additionally, there can be other steps taken to mitigate flight that I recall the defense was willing to agree to, including house arrest at a residence his parents had procured in NY, and the installation off a location tracking ankle bracelet. 
Denying bail in this case has greatly hindered due process and the defense's ability to respond to the charges. It sounds like due to his continued incarceration, there's still not been an adequate mechanism provided by which Ross can even review the terabytes of computer forensics evidence the prosecution has.

That's why, to answer OP's question, I would be feverishly working through the night after the story broke in order to set up a script on my computer that would post a Satoshi message of some sort saying "Dorian is not me" after a timed delay. I'd start the script right before I left my house to face reporters, with a delay of ~2 hrs. That way I'd be out and about and hopefully there would be video footage of an interview (of me denying being Satoshi) confirming I had my hands on the table the entire time. It's a pretty damn good alibi.
Now, I'm not saying this is what happened. I'm inclined to think now that Newspeak fingered the wrong Satoshi.

Well, now that I've got your attention... I was reading a little while back about a few REITs that specialized in renting out datacenters. I think they performed really well.
And it gave me an idea. What do you think about a cryptocoin mining-based REIT. Similar to the datacenter REITs, the idea would be to strategically purchase land in jurisdictions with cheap, stable electricity and good internet infrastructure. A further selection criterion would be permissive regulatory environments surrounding cryptomining. Perhaps another idea would be to locate in places where heat thrown off from miners could be diverted into thermoelectric generators or Stirling Engines  and the electricity easily sold back onto the grid. Colder locations might facilitate this.
Space could be rented by mining consortiums, and some capital raised by the REIT could also be diverted into funding internal mining projects.
Good idea? Bad idea?

- Use 4 or 5 bills to concatenate rather than 3
- Concatenate an additional, easily-rememberable personal passphrase onto the serial number string.
- Perform key-stretching via iterative hashing in order to obtain your brainwallet private key.

Bitcoin has great advantage as a means of exchange with no middlemen or bankers. It puts people back in charge of their own money.
However, the drawback is that there is now a bigger onus on the holder of bitcoins to keep their own money safe. And if it's gone, it's *really* gone. 
This is difficult for many due to computer illiteracy, unfamiliarity with computer security, or not understanding the ins and outs of bitcoin yet.
At its core, Neo is a method for people to get exposure to bitcoins, to buy them, and send them, and receive them, while letting someone else handle the security concerns of storing the coins, or the effort related to sending/receiving coins. Although many companies currently do this around the world, Neo is somewhat different in that they are a physical location where you can go in and consult with them, and interact with them.
Neo also plans to help mitigate risk consumers are exposed to through price volatility. At some point they will offer time-locked bitcoin accounts where the funds are held for a prespecified amount of time. By acting as the guarantors of a certain amount of fiat value in the account (even if the price of bitcoin drops) Neo can make money by splitting any possible gains (if the price of bitcoin rises) with the account holder. There will also be the option for euro-pegged accounts, where there will always be enough bitcoin in the account to cover a certain value of euros. If the price of bitcoin drops, the account is topped off, and vice versa. It's akin to a bank account, but with full reserve, not fractional reserve. And the customer can audit the company whenever they wish by viewing public addresses on the blockchain, proving that their funds are there.
Bee is a separate endeavor, but under the same roof. Bee is the payment network that is powered through Neo. They will offer Point-of-sale terminals for businesses that will interact with Bee cards, which will function much like debit cards do. The Bee cards will be linked to a bitcoin account at Neo. Neo will instantly convert any payments to euro if the business so desires, thus mitigating risks in bitcoin price fluctuation. And using the Bee payment network should enable lower fees than seen with traditional payment systems. Since it 'runs on bitcoin' so to speak, it doesn't incur the usual costs of running such a payment network. In addition, the settlements are instantaneous, which provides a great benefit for business owners. No more waiting for Paypal money to trickle into your account, or for credit card payments to clear. And no chargebacks either.

From the [Easycoin BCT thread](
@_date: 2014-03-11 10:52:10
When I think about the future of biomedical engineering, I'm actually much more excited about the potential for reprogramming cells to do certain tasks inside the body, rather than using miniature robots. The fact is, is that at certain biological scales, cells and proteins (and specially-engineered proteins) are the best tools for the job. Not little metallic inspector gadgets. Cells, essentially, are already evolutionarily optimized micromachines. And they're vastly more adept and interacting with our wetware.
So, more often than not, this is a much more realistic and feasible approach. Currently, molecular biology and gene therapy tools are vastly outpacing the kind of tech advances that would underpin nanobots. 
Here's a great example - [Chimaeric Antigen Receptors]( (CARs) are synthetic proteins that can be designed to help target cells of the immune system against adversaries they're not ordinarily adept at recognizing.
There's clinical trials ongoing where patients with a rare form of leukaemia have their blood drawn, and their white blood cells isolated. Then, an engineered retrovirus is used to integrate a new gene into the genomes of these cells -- a gene that enables them to produce a CAR that bestows them with a targeting system for recognizing the distinctive protein markers present on the exterior of the cancer cells of this form of leukaemia. These white blood cells are already cold blooded killers-- they have natural abilities to stalk and merk other cells in the body they 'perceive' to be threatening. The artificial CAR targeting system is just a way to augment their natural abilities and make them do our dirty work for a given target in the body. Cool, right?
So then, the reprogrammed cells are pumped back into the bloodstream of the patient, and soon thereafter, they start racking up kills. So far, (albeit with limited number of patients), the results appear to be very promising.
So, TLDR, the whole nanobot thing strikes me as kind of a throwback to old sci-fi and to popular science tropes. But we're making strides in attacking the same sorts of problems through good old fashioned bioengineering, i.e. reprogramming cells to do certain tasks. When certain cells already have many of the prerequisite abilities, why reinvent the wheel?

Thanks for the reply. It's refreshing to see that you're transparent about major attack surfaces remaining. Hopefully there will be at least some workable ideas on the table as to how to deal with this, as the network goes live.
Just a few ideas that came to me upon reading your reply:
On the disaster mitigation slash data recovery side:
One of the most tragic things that could happen if a user is pwned is that some griefer just deletes all their data (say 10 years worth of personal photos, entire music collection, journal, everything). And if the user had no other backups because they thought maidsafe had it all covered. Perhaps it's possible to make a couple different temporal backups of all of a user's files periodically? (Sort of like Apple Time Machine does). These 'master backups' would grant read access but not write access by the user's key. The only way they could be deleted is for them to become expired (after a certain amount of time), and replaced by newer temporal backups (to save on storage space use in the network). The further benefit of something like this is that it idiot-proofs the system. In reality it'd probably be used more often for when a user accidentally deletes a file and needs it restored.
On the security side:
As for 2FA, yes I kind of had a feeling that it might be totally incompatible with maidsafe. The yubikey seems like a more suitable idea... But don't they rely on a validation server also? Speaking of yubikeys, this reminds me... the problem of being able to log onto a computer (that is not yours, and could have malware) to control personal information (in this case bitcoins) is a problem that also faced the designers of the Trezor bitcoin hardware wallet. The Trezor is a little usb device that is sort of similar to the Yubikey. Drawing inspiration from the way the Trezor system works could be helpful here possibly. Here's their [site]( I know the devs have gone to great lengths to make it very secure (they better, right? if people are trusting bitcoins to it that is).

Yeah, very valid points. I share your concerns, although I'm long on bitcoin myself. But none of us know what the price will do, and their business model does rely in large part on the price not dropping precipitously.
I think the issues you mentioned are definitely things that Neo is trying to grapple with-- it is the impetus behind them trying to get clearance from Cyprus's equivalent of the SEC in order to be able to trade bitcoin derivatives (which will play into their risk hedging strategy). Pretty sure they are trying to get this squared away before they start doing stuff like time-locked wallets.
In the meantime, I imagine they're probably keeping a large reserve of bitcoin and euros on hand should the price falter. They were able to raise a lot of capital with their IPVO, especially given the price rise that occurred after they started offering shares. Sounds like they're also doing trading to help maintain/build reserves. But yes, this is indeed not without its concerns, given the state of most bitcoin exchanges. I think they definitely recognize this though.
It's a risky business venture, but that's part of what makes it so exciting.
Managing their exposure will be difficult, but I think their very real necessity for doing so (especially if they grow) will hopefully help to bootstrap mechanisms for doing so. A healthier derivatives market for instance, and more secure/trustless exchange platforms.

It's simple. 
But it requires coordination between Dorian and Satoshi. They both have to be onboard with this for it to work.
Dorian sits down somewhere with a reporter, maybe they have sushi or something. The reporter can verify that while they are together, Satoshi doesn't use any devices or make any phone calls.
Now the reporter posts a random number message on Twitter. Satoshi signs the message with the genesis block key, or his GPG key, or posts the message with his bitcointalk account, or his P2PF account, or any other presumably unique identifiers that we associate with Satoshi.
Of course, to a truly sceptical observer, this doesn't prove it fully. It's always possible that, assuming Dorian *is* Satoshi, he turned over his account credentials or key to a trusted person before the meeting so that the message could be broadcasted without him.

I am aware of no thermodynamic law violated by use of the following, proven technologies for turning heat energy back into electricity:
If you can prove otherwise, I wish you the best of luck on your trip to Stockholm to collect your prize.
Perhaps the reason it's not widespread currently in the IT sector is that in the era of cheap electricity it's not always going to make economic sense to try to implement plans and infrastructure to reharvest heat. 
But just a quick Google tells me people are already thinking about doing such things. Not only for potential cost savings, but also for greener technology and sustainability. Which is stuff we will have to address eventually.

Great point. The security aspect occurred to me as well. If I understand it correctly, the domain registrant will have to use their private bitcoin key (that was used to make the domain registration txn) in order to sign updates and prove it came from them. So as long as the domain operator is trustworthy, and their key is not compromised, there would be no prima facie reason to expect malicious code fuckery. What I'm saying is, how would it be any different from the risks of visiting any other website on the net? Doesn't one still have to trust the owner of a DNS-based domain not to serve up maliciousness?

Your concern registers with me too. But after thinking through it a little more, I don't think it's really the same thing. 
To become a transaction arbiter, there's really very little barrier to entry. Not so with a credit card company. For Bitrated, this makes fee structures extremely competitive instead of collusionary/oligopolistic. 
It appears there's quite a few arbiters for hire on Bitrated. Many of them take no fee as long as they're never called in for dispute resolution (so that's very different from a credit card right there).

No. I think you missed the entire point of my "proceeds from crime" argument. For the money laundering statute to apply, it doesn't matter how the funds *were to be used in the future*. It matters how the relevant funds *had been used in the past*. 18 USC 1956 criminalizes transferring/transmitting the proceeds of crime. It does not criminalize transferring/transmitting money that could presumably be used to support a crime (such as purchasing drugs) subsequently.
Do I think Faiella knew that the bitcoins he sold had a high probability of being used to purchase drugs on SR? Sure. But it wasn't really any of his business what those people did with their bitcoins. His business was selling bitcoins, not drugs (albeit through a website that didn't exactly have a legal good reputation). The act of selling bitcoins is not illegal. Using SR as a trading platform is not, by itself, illegal. Using the SR to trade licit goods is not illegal. 
I'm trying to think of a good analogy here. Imagine if I ran a check cashing business on the wrong side of the tracks in some inner city. Based on the appearance of some of my clients (track marks), I suspect they are probably heroin addicts, and using the money they obtain from cashing their paychecks (legal money from their employers) to fund their addiction. Am I required to cease allowing them to cash checks, based on my strong suspicion? Or is it sort of a "not my business what they do with the money I exchanged them" situation? I would argue the latter.
What if I own an ATM outside of a medical marijuana business? There's a strong chance that I'm charging a fee to the clientele of the MMJ business so that they can use their credit cards to withdraw cash that they can then buy marijuana with. Am I guilty of a federal crime here?
What if I am the manager of a Safeway in the inner city, and I have just learned that drug users are now purchasing [Tide detergent]( in order to pay their drug dealers with? After I read this article, I look back at sales records and see that Tide is selling at my store in abnormal quantities. Am I legally bound to try to stop this? Am I now facilitating drug trade if I keep selling Tide to people? Is it wrong or illegal to profit off of acting as a detergent reseller, knowing full well that the detergent bottles could likely be used to fund drug transactions?
In each of the above 3 examples, I'm not at all convinced that it should be illegal, or that it should be classed as money laundering. This is because there is no compelling reason to believe that client money *going into the transaction* (paycheck, debit/credit card balance, or cash) is dirty, i.e. *represents proceeds of a crime*. Likewise, there's no reason to believe that the exchange money *going out of the transaction* (cash, cash, or Tide) represents the *proceeds of a crime*. In all 3 instances, there's a reason to believe that the cash has a higher-than-normal chance of being used to buy drugs. But that's immaterial. Really not anyone's business but the client's what they do with their cash.


I think Dick Wolf's shows are terrible. I'm more of a Judge Joe Brown fan. But you make a fair point here. Although statutes are the "primary source" so to speak, prior jurisprudence and 'spirit of the law' certainly do have a role as well. In fact, there are probably many instances where prior jurisprudence has rendered the application of a law almost unrecognizably different from an a priori reading of the statutes.
IANAL or a legal scholar so I am more than willing to admit that my best interpretation of the statutes as written might not be a sufficiently deep exploration of whether or not they can be applied or not.
If you can point to prior jurisprudence that directly contradicts any of my literal interpretations of the statutes in question I would be most interested in reading about them.


As currently written, I believe the federal laws surrounding money transmission have become so overbroad, that I'd contend that their purpose is to be able to lock up or expropriate nearly anyone the state wants to, who is engaging in some kind of economic activity they don't like.
Consider the following:
* Under 18 USC 1960, failure to register as a MSB with FinCEN is a federal crime
* Under 18 USC 1960, failure to register as a MSB with *individual states* you conduct business in is also a federal crime
* Nobody can say for sure what an MSB is actually defined as. It has differing definitions depending on which statute you are looking at. If we are to go by 31 CFR 1010.100, it could simply mean "Any other person engaged in the transfer of funds", including through an "informal value transfer system"
* Almost every single person is "engaged in the transfer of funds" or acts an "informal value transfer system" in some capacity
* The mens rea requirement of 18 USC 1960 has been stricken by the Patriot Act
So, a broad interpretation of the MSB law means that a great deal of people are quite potentially in danger. Including probably 100% of bitcoin businesses, or even LocalBitcoins sellers, that operate in the US (Are any of them really licensed both federally AND in every single state they do business in?)
Say I'm running any kind of internet business in the US, especially one dealing with money -- however tangentially. And I really wanted to be safe from MSB statutes. Before I even started operating (lest I be retroactively punished), I'd have to: retain expensive lawyers to help interpret the law, costing serious cash, and then do MSB registration in 50+ jurisdictions, costing serious time and money (many jurisdictions require bonding I believe). Who is able to do such a thing, before even having a revenue stream? The answer is basically no one, except for the legacy institutions in the industry. Hell, established industry probably helped write the MSB laws, because they sure do protect them from competition.
I think these laws are more dangerous on the books than the 'crimes' they're supposed to prevent. And they got way worse after 9.11 (with the removal of mens rea). Just one of the many assaults on liberty that were introduced with the Patriot Act.
Look, I realize why they struck the mens rea. It was to be able to go after Brown people. Informal money transmitters, hawaladars, and the like, who transferred money from the US back to the Middle East (a major focus of anti-terrorist-financing after 9.11, but really most of it was just being used for family remittances). 
But what that inadverdently (or advertently) did is make virtually anyone the state wishes to destroy vulnerable to being prosecuted under these statutes.
I think this is way too much power for the state to have. The MSB laws not only hold back innovation and progress, but they also put everyone at risk of government abuse. 


I completely agree with you. The Aaron Swartz case is a recent tragic reminder of how malicious and vindictive federal prosecutors can be if you don't accept their plea bargain and instead try to actually attempt to exercise your right to a fair trial.

This is not strictly true. 
Intent is just one test for *mens rea* (guilty mind). And it is the highest degree of *mens rea*, the lower degrees being *willful blindness* and *criminal negligence* (in the US).
Aside from the fact that *mens rea* encompasses more than just criminal intent, some statutes explicitly do not a require application of a *mens rea* test. 
One such statute is in fact one of the three that Shrem is accused of (Failure to register as a money service business). The Patriot Act actually amended this statute to remove the mens rea requirement. It was basically to be able to prosecute Brown people for running informal value transfer networks (Hawala). How dare they do so in defiance of the state, and without its boundless paternalism! Really it's just another step on the road to totalitarianism.

Thanks for analysing. Yeah, it seemed to me like what they were proposing was pretty buzzword-laden, and it also sounded like it would require a *lot* of work to implement such a system. Partly because it relied on pulling in technology that isn't quite primetime yet (OT). And really difficult CS problems like computer learning as well. Perhaps this stuff could be explored for a curecoin2.0 but for now I think people should just work with what they've got.
Regardless, the main idea of distributing up individual folding jobs amongst the network seemed intriguing to me. I don't know enough about the internals of the folding algorithms to comment on whether that's feasible. But conceptually, it did seem a reasonable approach to me. If you take it as a given that *most* nodes are folding honestly, then any outliers could be detected and the offending party could be 'kicked'. 
I'm pretty out of my depth here, but from what I can muster, I think there are distributed computing networks that are able to kick out dishonest/dysfunctional nodes. Doesn't this happen with bittorrent? The developers of Maidsafe I think have also figured out a way to do this to keep their network running smoothly. In a curecoin network, I think the hardest part would be making sure nodes that are kicked stay kicked, or at least making recidivism unprofitable for them. This would require some kind of disincentivisation that penalizes bad nodes so that it becomes unprofitable to spam. For that, perhaps some kind of minimal proof-of-stake system would be helpful.

*All* properly configured nodes should reject transactions they perceive to be double-spends, and not rebroadcast them.
So, the only way to sneak one in is to take advantage of the fact that txns do not fully propagate through the network.
I may be wrong about the Electrum servers actually... I thought there might be a handful of them only, but it seems like there are actually 25 or so. You should be able to choose which one your client connects to as well.
So it could be that you could just try sending Txn  to each one of the Electrum servers in sequence, in order to ensure A) that you can find one that didn't get Txn  and B) that you can disseminate your transaction as widely as possible, because it will be an upstream battle for it to propagate through a network where part of the network has already seen Txn 
EDIT: To add, ordinarily nodes not accepting txns that are double-spends is a good thing. It fights spam and it fights antisocial behavior on the network. That's how it should be. I think the solution to stuck coins should be miners making it easier to confirm legitimate transaction trees descended from an illegitimately fee-ed transaction. Not nodes and software developers making it easier for people to broadcast double spend txns.

OK, I follow you now. I did not know that handy conversion formula.
We can calculate a higher bound on serial space just using OP's method of 3 bills that are either 1 or 2 dollar bills. 1 and 2 dollar bills all have 10-char serial numbers of the form : 
[A-L] [0-9] [0-9] [0-9] [0-9] [0-9] [0-9] [0-9] [0-9] [A-Y, excluding O] 
Which means there are [26.4 billion]( serials possible and thus [~18.4 nonillion]( concatenations of three bills possible.
Converting that to BOE we get [103.86]( bits of entropy at most. 
But yes you're right, someone who [looked at what ranges have actually been issued]( or performed analytics (e.g. weighting older bills' serials with a lower probability of inclusion) could probably chop that down a fair amount.
So yeah, perhaps the method is safer if we add a fourth 1 or 2 dollar bill. This raises upper bound BOE to ~138.
In addition, some kind of personalized salt concatenated on would also be advisable I think.

Please forgive people if they treat the content of your leaks with a healthy amount of scepticism. I wouldn't take it personal. I mean, did you not expect this?

For that reason, it just raises more questions than it answers for a lot of people. You shouldn't expect everyone to feel grateful right away if they don't find this stuff particularly useful to go off of.
For the record, I believe that you believe that you're acting in the best interests of the bitcoin community. But still I have to be sceptical about your possible ulterior motives for your actions.

This is not bad advice.
But I just wanted to point out that sometimes college savings plans can bite people in the ass.
This is because when you apply for financial aid, the amount saved via college savings plans is factored in, and can decrease the level of financial aid available.
If instead, you take the money you *would* put towards college savings, and invest it into something not factored into financial aid accounting (e.g. real estate) it's possible to come out ahead.
This isn't a good strategy in *every* instance, but its just something to be aware of.

Let's leave aside the MSB registration and AML/KYC reporting statutes for a second. Not that I agree that these statutes ought to exist in the first place, but if these statutes do indeed apply here, I could certainly see how they might have violated them.
I was more interested in dissecting your claim that "His [Faiella's] clients were drug dealers, and he knew it." This also seems to roughly be the argument that the feds are making to support their claims that money laundering statutes apply.
So from your last post it sounds like you are agreeing with me that his real clients were not the drug dealers, per se, but rather people who *may have been* potential customers of said drug dealers.
The problem here is that the product Faiella was selling (bitcoins) is not in fact illegal. The fact that these transactions were partly assisted through the Silk Road, is immaterial. The Silk Road was at its core a technologically advanced escrow and customer feedback system facilitating an online marketplace economy. Besides banning certain types of goods (weapons, CP) it was agnostic to what was being traded on the site. Faiella happened to be using the SR platform, which also hosted many drug listings, but there should not be guilt by association. Hell, people sold T-shirts through the Silk Road as well. It wasn't all criminal. So the fact that Faiella operated his bitcoin sales enterprise on SR is circumstantial evidence at best.
Your characterization of or comparison of bitcoins to 'special weed tokens' is laughably fallacious. What you're missing here is that bitcoins were/are available from other sources besides Faiella. It's not at all comparable to some kind of in-house weed token exchange. Second, the purchase of cannabis or other drugs is by no means the only use for bitcoins. Bitcoins can essentially be used to perform most of the kinds of transactions one would make with fiat currency, plus more.
So what I'm saying is: Faiella's bitcoin sale service was **in no way indispensible** for the operations of SR drug sales. There were plenty of other methods of obtaining bitcoin. Further, a customer purchasing drugs via SR was **in no way assured** assuming he had bought from Faiella. There were plenty of other uses for the bitcoins besides drugs. And there are other reasons (anonymity for instance) why someone would make use of Faiella's service as opposed to another method of obtaining bitcoin.

Yeah, that's a great comic and makes a good point. Personally I feel like my insights and aptitudes are much more suited to understanding naturally evolved systems, though. Usually they have to be very elegant, and streamlined, in order to compete in the biological world. For the large part, they just make sense. I feel like my insight can extend to manmade systems as well, provided they are well-engineered.
 Some manmade systems, however, (notably, the US tax code) just make me balk the more I hear about them. What's the difference? Perhaps the key difference is competition. For an ant colony or a protist or a virus or an industrial process or a computer algorithm, there is loads of competition. There is selective pressure to come up with the most innovative solutions, to evolve new efficiencies, to minimize waste! To save time and resources! 
Contrastingly, the US tax code is forced on people at gunpoint.  Within a very wide geographical swathe, there's no competition. There's very little selective pressure for it to become more 'fit'. That's why I think competitive governance is a forward-thinking concept. While human talents have been remarkable at engineering new industrial processes, more efficient machines, new computer algorithms, and so forth, governments have become stagnant, bloated, inefficient, venal, and wholly unworthy of allegiance.

Sure, I don't disagree with you that it's worth investigating and trying to form an opinion on. Sadly there seems to be a lack of tangible information to work from.
For the record, I don't have anything stuck on Gox. Perhaps that colors my perception in some way. I don't know if that makes me more biased or less. Just throwing that out there.
What it seems like to me, though, is that some people are actively working from the premise that Gox is insolvent. And then every little thing that Gox does, any tiny piece of news related to Gox, or even in all likelihood unrelated (big mysterious sell order on Stamp), gets interpreted through that lens, in order to color in all the details of this foregone conclusion-- that Gox is insolvent. In the absence of any concrete news, people are magnifying the importance of these little things. That's just how I see it. 
But again, I really don't know how it'll all pan out. And certainly the situation is quite beleaguering, even speaking as someone with no funds on Gox. Just hope everyone can keep a cool head.

Maybe I didn't explain myself well. 
The duress I was referring to is his impending sentencing now that he's entered his plea. There is quite a bit of leeway in how the judge can choose to mete out his punishment. 
Thus, Charlie's public statements prior to sentencing may not be an accurate summation of his internal feelings. Appearing remorseful and accepting culpability after entering a guilty plea are obvious strategies for trying to elicit mercy from a judge.
Duress isn't just something that occurs under 'suspicious' circumstances. Our entire justice system is based on it. It's how the state secures convictions and makes examples of people.

What you just described sounds like it moves away from the principle of decentralized domain name registration. Involving a bot seems inelegant. The bot is now like a domain name issuer. Who operates the bot? Now they have a copy of the private key for my domain as well? Well fuck, I hope I trust them. 
Ideally there would be no key escrow whatsoever! It should be possible with the blockchain.
 I could be entirely off base, because I'm in way over my head here, but here's how I currently envision the system working at an overview level.
Let's take the example of me wanting to make a decentralized market site that runs over the PirateBrowser system.
- First I choose a domain name. It could be anything really, not limited to those enforced DNS domain name suffixes by any means. Let's say I want to register a domain for my new decentralized marketplace: "pirateroad.fuckthepolice"
- I hash the string 'pirateroad.fuckthepolice' in such a way that it produces a valid bitcoin address.
- I now send a bitcoin amount **to** the pirateroad.fuckthepolice bitcoin address, **P**, which I just generated, being sure to send **from** a bitcoin address, **A**, *that I control the private key for*. If I'm the first one to send bitcoin to this address, then this allows me to 'stake out' and lay claim to the domain name. I can prove ownership subsequently by signing messages using my private key associated with **A**.
* The bitcoin balance I sent to **P** is lost forever. I can't spend it, because **P** was not generated from a public-private keypair, it was generated from a human-readable string. The BTC sent to **P** is a sacrifice. This actually is not a bad thing. First, it has the effect of making everyone else's coins worth more (you can think of it as compensation for the privilege of using the blockchain as a registry). Second, by making the registration process expensive, it ensures that spamming (i.e. domain squatting in this case) is discouraged. In order for registration to be recognized as valid by TorBrowser, it might need to be above some threshold value, that would in fact discourage spamming. 
* Because the domain registration occurred via the blockchain, and because the blockchain is also a decentralized chronometer, we have a timestamp for when registration occurred. PirateBrowser can use this feature to revoke recognition of registration after one year (52596 blocks later, in bitcoin time) to discourage domain squatting. If I want to renew pirateroad.fuckthepolice as my year's running up, I can renew the fee, making sure to spend from **A** again. This timestamping function also allows for the BTC domain registration fee to float over time to account for fluctuations in bitcoin's market price. The PirateBrowser program can recognize what counted as a valid fee at whichever stage of the blockchain the transaction occurred in.
* OK, so I registered my new domain. How do I upload version1.0 of my site to the P2P network? After I'm done with my HTML files and site resources, I zip them, and I sign the zip archive + the hash of the 6th most recent bitcoin block (for timestamping purposes) using my private key for **A**, producing a hash digest *proving* that it was the owner of pirateroad.fuckthepolice that issued the file, at that point in time. I then make the zip archive and associated signed hash digest available to the P2P network.

Ha. That's a good question. 
I'm trying to put myself in the authors' shoes here. The problem is, there's a real lack of 'credible' information about bitcoin sometimes. Bitcoin is on the bleeding edge. You don't really see all that much in-depth, English-language news about bitcoin (especially regarding bitcoin legal regimes in foreign countries).
And to the extent that bitcoin *is* reported on in the mainstream English-language media, we are awash in FUD, misinformation, misapprehensions, outright lies, and uncritical parroting of government officials.
But the Internet enables a lot of news to be crowdsourced now. Now, some dude in Croatia can read some policy publication in his country, help translate it into English, and share it with predominantly English language bitcoin communities, such as this very subreddit.
So if I was writing a research paper on how different countries are treating bitcoin, I'd probably draw upon as a source as well.

Right. The serial numbers are not truly random at all. The numbers and letter series' are largely sequential. 
One could just use a site like [this one]( to see which serials correspond to which years of issuance and which [printing locations](

Well, both the statutory definitions of crimes under the CFAA and the judicial interpretations of this law are pretty broad as it turns out. That was abundantly clear in the wake of Swartz's prosecution and Weev's also. CFAA criminalizes access “without authorization” or in a way that “exceeds authorization.”
Now I'm not saying I agree that the CFAA is a good law as written or that I agree with the prosecution of Weev or Swartz. 
But as you say, it is pretty damn hypocritical of the FBI to be using the same types of tactics they go after others for. 
Is some hypocrisy on the part of the government unavoidable? Perhaps so. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't call them out on it.

It's an interesting concept for sure. If all the HTML and site resources are shared on the P2P network, then does this not make it harder to update websites, especially updating them in real-time (like for a blog, or a marketplace, or a tracker website)? How does a domain owner push out website updates? Would they just sign site update packages using the private key that registered the domain, and then broadcast and seed to the network?

Yes. I was curious about this a while ago (probably a year and a half ago or so) and turns out there was someone on the EVE forums converting ISK to BTC. The exchange rate offered was horrendous though, so at least at that time, I'm guessing there wasn't very much competition or much ISK&lt;&gt;BTC liquidity (which would've driven his price down).
I seem to recall also a reddit post from a while back about purchasing PLEX with BTC. People could meet him on a virtual space station hub (probably Jita?) and receive PLEX in for BTC. That's awesome by the way... very Neal Stephenson-esque (you know, minus the 3D avatars). It seemed that the rate was very reasonable. Probably someone had a crapton of PLEX and wanted to offload them for something more valuable.
Haven't checked in a while whether BTC is still coming and going out of the EVE universe tho.

Yep. There's a whole department devoted to this intelligence laundering, called the "[Special Operations Division]( (at least in the case of the DEA). NSA tips are fed to the other agency, and a 'parallel construction'  (i.e. an alternate evidence chain that would appear not to rely on the NSA tip) is fabricated in order to obtain a warrant.
You seem pretty resigned to this sort of behavior continuing, but I imagine there could be a legal test to this practice mounted soon though. The tricky part is proving where the tip originated. But, if the initial tip is shown to have originated from warrantless surveillance, any further evidence (and prosecution) based on this illegal intelligence gathering would be considered ['fruit of the poisonous tree']( so to speak, and considered inadmissible. Furthermore, the concealment of the provenance of such intelligence could itself violate constitutional due process rights, due to the [Brady]( decision.
EDIT: IIRC, I think Ross's lawyer has made statements to the effect that he is aware of the possibility of parallel construction being used in this case, and is being diligent to try and make this come out during the discovery process, if indeed it did happen. So that's encouraging.
@_date: 2014-04-14 08:03:40
Yes that would be interesting (someone's probably done it). It might be a difficult study though, as drugs are probably the main cash cow for gangs and criminal syndicates, and drug trade is still illegal to a high degree throughout the world (due to US influence).
The argument that these laws birth criminal syndicates just seems to make rational sense to me... 
But if one were looking for more concrete evidence, my cited example of the Prohibition is a great one. The lucrative trade in contraband alcohol directly fueled an explosion in organized crime during that era. So that's a good historical study on the subject, because you can directly contrast the mafia activity during Prohibition, to that directly before and after, all within the same country.
More recently in California there was a prominent state senator Leland Yee who was staunchly pro-gun-control, and yet he seems to have been a key figure of a notorious arms smuggling syndicate. Makes you wonder... By the way, this sort of situation is common enough that there's a term for it : [Bootleggers and Baptists](

What's Reid to do at that point? He's already in pretty deep. I suppose Reid's smartest move was to bolt at the first mention of criminal activity.
EDIT2: I read through the Espinoza affidavit and I still don't agree with the money laundering charge in that one. There's no smoking gun that would have caused Espinoza to know that the cash he accepted was actually illicit proceeds, rather than just the fact that he knew the bitcoin he sold were liable to be used in criminal enterprise in the future.

Having not tried this ever, I don't really know for sure, but here's my best guess. I'm answering your question with the assumption that the first transaction was sent through Electrum as well. 
I think the answer is that it would eventually work, given enough time between the two transactions. (Assuming Txn  never got inducted into a block, and eventually the network forgot it).
The deterministic wallet restoration gets past one issue, which is that a record of Txn  is locally remembered, preventing a second spend from the address(es). Restoration is akin to a reset. Now, all the client knows about the keys are what it can scrape from the blockchain (which obviously does not include unconfirmed txns).
The particularity of this situation that is important to keep in mind, though, is how transactions are broadcast with Electrum. It's not P2P. Since Electrum is a thin client, Electrum servers always handle the broadcast. So unless enough time has passed for the servers to forget Txn  there's no way that Txn  is going to get past them. They won't rebroadcast.
If you were using bitcoin-qt, there's a chance that deleting and then restoring the wallet from backup would work, because now we've cleared memory of Txn  **and** we've connected to a separate group of P2P peers that may not have seen Txn  so they could potentially rebroadcast Txn  until a miner gets it.
Hope that makes sense.
EDIT: Your best bet with Electrum, I think, is to restore, and then make a raw transaction ([directions here]( ) that you can copypaste into pushtx sites. It looks like as of Electrum 1.95, this client  supports coin control, which is good. That means you can make a new transactions using the exact same private key(s) used in the Txn

If their point was that profiting off of government proscriptions can serve as the basis for a gang, mafia, or other kind of criminal organisation's raison d'etre, then I think it's a valid point.
Most gangs and other forms of organized crime make most of their money by profiting off of victimless 'crime' that is banned by the government, for instance: gambling, drugs, prostitution, cigarette smuggling, bootlegging (during the American Alcohol Prohibition at least). Protecting their 'share' of this lucrative and dangerous criminal enterprise is then a reason for them to commit other, non-victimless crimes (murders, theft, etc.). And since they're breaking the law anyway, what's the harm in more crime?
This is not to say that legalizing all victimless crimes would make gangs go away entirely, but it would definitely hurt their bottom line since that is how most of their money is made. So I think there would be a big reduction in gangs, gang violence, cartels, mafia, etc. But it wouldn't eliminate gangs altogether, because there are still non-victimless crimes that can be profitable.

I agree with everything you say in your article-- how everyone should pay more heed to the counterparty risk that exists many places currently in the bitcoin economy. In essence, every time you entrust your coins to a third party, they cease to really be *yours* in any mathematically defined sense.
Except for one part. I'm not sure if the premise you're working from is indeed correct. Has Mt Gox failed? Are we basing this all on an unsubstantiated document, of dubious origin, which in all likelihood could be a forgery? I'm honestly not sure yet whether this is factual, or whether this is just mass hysteria and groupthink.
But, even if Mt Gox has not failed and this is just a hoax-induced panic, everything you said is still important. We need better public auditing of bitcoin holdings, better security, and better trustless exchanges. That is an undisputed fact.

I'm not sure I totally agree with that characterisation. There's plenty of shibes who are speculating on DOGE and hoping the price will go 'to the moon', just like there's some of the same sorts of folks in the bitcoin community. Hell, there's even "Investor Shibe" flair on if memory serves. If we're talking about relative percentages of people who are in it for that reason, I think I'd agree with your point though. And overall I do think the community of dogecoiners tends to be more fun and welcoming. So can't blame you there. I'd really like to see DOGE 'make it' long term as a cryptocurrency. As a smaller crypto, with a shorter-term coin minting schedule, and sharing a mining hardware class with other cryptos (mainly LTC), the network could be potentially vulnerable going into the future though. This [post]( is pretty interesting if you havent' seen it yet. I hope DOGE succeeds but either way it's an awesome experiment. I feel the same way about BTC too, really.

Sketchy, granted. But I'm not sure if it could truly be called illegal. You're not committing the futurecrime, you've not planned the futurecrime, you're not benefiting from the futurecrime-- indeed, you're not even sure if this futurecrime will even come to pass (perhaps the buyer is just a full-of-shit braggart, or more likely, an informant). Furthermore, assuming that commission of the futurecrime is a legitimate threat, then there's very little chance that the futurecrime will be prevented by your refusal to transact. Like I said before, the prospective buyer will just find another seller and be sure to bolt their flaps.
Arguing that we should go after people for facilitating possible  futurecrimes, when they were in no way indispensable for the futurecrime to occur, just strikes me as the height of absurdity.

One of the downsides of heavy reliance on government funding for scientific and biomedical research is that much of the research has to fit in with or even undergird the dominant legal/social/cultural paradigm and the War on Drugs narrative in order to get funding. 
It's really a pity that psychedelic research has been so greatly hampered by the US during the past decades. I think it's pretty clear that illicit drugs such as cannabis, MDMA, LSD, psilocybin, DMT, and ibogaine have a great deal of promise in biomedicine, psychiatry, therapy, end of life care, addiction, and so on. 
And it's a travesty that so far we've not been able to fully explore and unlock their potential. The War on Drugs is arguably one of *the* worst policy decision in the history of this country.

So, buying through PayPal is considered somewhat risky (mostly for the seller though). Technically buying BTC through PayPal is against their terms of service, so you can run into problems there. 
Another option is exchange websites. Typically each exchange will only operate in certain jurisdictions, or at least, only accept certain kinds of fiat money. Most allow you to fund your account with fiat money using a bank transfer. Then you can purchase coins from sellers on the exchange. The exchange website acts as an escrow. You have to trust that the exchange is solvent and won't run away with funds, so it can be unwise to keep large balances of fiat or of BTC on the exchange. 
In some countries there are even websites that allow you to buy directly from them, without having to deal with all the complicated exchange stuff (order books and the like). You simply tell them how much BTC  you want and they can tell you how much cash to deposit into their account via a money order or moneygram-type payment service provider (like many grocery stores, convenience stores, or post offices might have).
One of the best options for people all over the world is localbitcoins.com. On this site you can find sellers in your area to do face to face transactions with (in a public place). The site facilitates deals by holding coins in escrow. If you don't want to do a face to face transaction, there are also options on this site for depositing cash in sellers' bank accounts in exchange for bitcoin.
As you said, mining is not the best option right now because specialized hardware is needed, and it's currently difficult to get a return on your investment there. 
Another great option is to sell goods or services in exchange for BTC. Are you good at web design? Translation? Tutoring? Or even stripping on a web cam? Advertise your service online in exchange for BTC. There's even a subreddit where you can advertise services or advertise that you are looking to hire someone for bitcoins : 
Hope that helps!

So, if I understand it right, the address one sends to in order to 'stake out' a domain name is obtained by hashing the domain name? And a single satoshi would be sufficient for staking? And they prove ownership of the domain, then, by controlling the private key which was used to spend to that staking address, and being able to sign messages with it?

I like the quote too. But that's about as far as it goes with me. Even though I would probably register as libertarian-leaning on the spectrum, I don't really go crazy for Rand.
Actually it gets me kind of annoyed when libertarians gets pigeonholed as Ayn Rand lovers or vice-versa, that Ayn Rand is held up to typify libertarianism. It makes about as much sense as doing the same with Ronald Reagan.
Sure, there are some quotes or writings from each of them that jive well with certain things that are common to a libertarian mindset. 
But I don't think libertarian beliefs are all that uniform. There's a lot of shades.
So yeah, some libertarian-leaning people like Rand, some like Reagan. 
There's also lots that don't care for either, and get tired when they're held up as ambassadors of libertarianism, or straw-men for people that use them to critique libertarianism as a whole. (not that you're someone who does this).

This seems like compelling stuff. They make a good case for making this happen.
And I like Austin's remix of the classic (and likely obsolete) Google maxim "don't be evil", replacing it with "can't be evil". It's reassuring that both of Austin and Adam have roots in the cypherpunk community. Shit, Adam even invented haschash, which turned out to be a crucial ingredient of bitcoin. That's good street cred.
But still, I can't really judge their proposals without filling in some gaps in my understanding. Some of it was explained a bit handwavily.
Here's a few things I am confused by... If anyone has any answers I'd be grateful.
- Sidechains for different purposes (or even transaction cases) seems like a good proposal for ensuring that the main bitcoin chain isn't overwhelmed should bitcoin really take off. Current limitations include both the size of the blockchain, and the number of txns/second that the network can process. 
Maybe geographically-based sidechains can even emerge for regional commerce. Say I'm going to stay in Berlin for a month and plan to spend a lot of BTC at local establishments, I could convert onto the berlinchain the value I thought I might spend. However, the existence of so many sidechains, and the need to hop between them for doing different things, could itself cause bloat in the bitcoin blockchain proper, assuming the main blockchain is the central clearinghouse for chain-hopping. Or, alternatively, is it possible to hop coins from one sidechain directly onto another sidechain? Is the hopping mediated by atomic swap algos?
- They were talking about establishing a sidechain for a national currency that has set, mathematically-enforced monetary policy (inflation/expansion) built in. How does that work? I thought the only currency used by the sidechains was bitcoin, and that for the two-way-pegging to work, there has to be a fixed peg between sidechain and chain proper. Could this permit a sidechain that functioned as an inflationary currency? Would it have to take the form of automatic mathematical demurrage from all addresses on the sidechain, at some regular interval? Where the extracted value was given back to the address of some national bank that served as the issuer?
- They talked a lot about systemic risk. And I agree sidechains are a good idea from the perspective that they can operate without requiring alterations to bitcoin core which jeopardize it. But wouldn't plugging a bunch of sidechains into bitcoin proper open up systemic risk? If something were to go majorly wrong with bitcoin (maybe not likely, but still), then the whole thing, included all the side-chains tied in, collapses along with it, right? There may yet be some real advantages to having systems (alts) that are insulated from one another.

For people who don't know what is Folding @ home, or why protein folding is important, I'm reposting a conversation I had on [this thread]( a couple days ago.
(I should mention-- I think Rosetta @ home is more geared towards the applications that I was talking about; I believe Folding @ home is somewhat more focused towards understanding how aberrant protein folding relates to human disease. Both very important applications though for harnessing distributed computing to understand protein folding.)
Ah nice. Yea that's what my gut feeling was. Do you think there is any way for someone outside of the academia world to contribute or get involved in this kind of stuff? Barrier to entry seems too artificially high.
There is, actually.
A little background first: protein engineering is a hard scientific problem currently. And a lot of therapeutic engineered proteins derive their usefulness from binding to another protein target very specifically, and very strongly. Typically if you're trying to engineer a protein that has a high binding affinity to a target, you need to harness high degrees of randomness in order to pull out something useful. 
One approach is to harness the randomness already used by organisms. You can inject an animal with an antigen and then let their immune system naturally produce antibodies that bind to the target, which you then select for. The process by which new antibodies are made is essentially a stochastic recombination of different protein segments that generates a huge repertoire of possible binding affinities, so this tends to work pretty well. 
There are also ways to recapitulate such random selection in vitro, by synthetically generating large libraries of protein variants based on a single protein scaffold, and then screening them for the desired binding properties. Since protein folding is not very well understood, these 'randomness' approaches usually produce the best results currently.
Another up-and-coming approach is known as 'rational design'. This means leveraging what *is known* currently about protein folding and protein-protein docking in order to make educated guesses about how to design proteins with the desired properties. Often times this approach is used to generate a 'first draft' and then random screens are utilized afterwards to further optimize the protein.
How can we make this process better? One approach is to further our understanding of the protein folding process, and how proteins interact with one another. For instance, the holy grail of protein folding is to develop algorithmic heuristics that can do so-called 'ab initio' structure prediction with high accuracy. This means, inputting a string of amino acids (essentially, this is what a protein is) and being able to predict how it will fold into a globular protein shape.
Predictably, some of the best tools for advancing our knowledge of this are taking advantage of crowdsourcing, and distributed computing.
A lab at UW Seattle produced a crowdsourcing game where you can compete to fold a protein into the most energetically favourable configuration, it's called [Fold-it]( I've not played it before, but evidently it's not something you need a biology background in order to play. After a while, people just seem to 'grok' certain strategies for protein folding. In turn, the data generated by players can be used to develop better computational algorithms for protein folding.
On the distributed computing side, there's [Rosetta developed by the same lab at UW. While your computer's not in use, you can donate CPU/GPU time to run folding algorithms that iterate different folds and calculate how energetically favourable they are. There's also another project called [Folding which was developed by a Stanford lab, that does similar work.
Awesome! I am checking out those three links now. I had heard of them before, but never investigated for some reason.
Protein folding is a very interesting problem to me. Do you think it is solvable? Has it been solved for small length chains? Do such chains even exist in vivo?
Also, what makes it so hard to solve? Now that we can find the shape and AA makeup of proteins, and now that we know about domains and such, shouldn't we be well on our way to the 'ab initio' method of protein creation?
This is not my field but I'll try to answer best I can.
I'm not sure if ab initio protein folding is completely solvable. Because in reality, there's a lot of factors external to the primary sequence of a protein that will influence it's folding. Post-translational modifications, cofactors, chaperone proteins, just off the top of my head. But the point is, there's probably a lot of room for improvement currently in our computation approaches to structure prediction.
For small-length chains, yeah, it's much more straightforward. As you continue to add amino acids to the polymer, it adds more and more degrees of freedom, more possible permutations for the structure. It exponentially expands the landscape of potential structures that could be adopted. But small protein chains do exist in vivo! In fact they do lots of important things. Neuropeptides come to mind (literally).
I think the most difficult part is just the vast ocean of possibilities of different conformations that could exist for a reasonably-sized protein. An understanding of common domain folds certainly helps to get a rough shape for a prediction, but the devil's in the details. Minor structural refinements can matter a lot in terms of protein function. But understanding common domains can't always bail you out. Bioinformatics/bioprospecting has dredged up a lot of data about primary protein sequences from various microorganisms and such, and we have no idea what shape a lot of these proteins should adopt. There's only so many protein structures that have been solved by crystallography or NMR or whatever. And the other thing is, with engineering synthetic proteins, sometimes you're trying to engineer a fold that doesn't really have a known counterpart in nature. That's where better ab initio capabilities can help us out.
TL;DR: Engineered proteins not found in nature are important tools for biomedicine. If you stretch out a protein end-to-end, it's just a polymer string of amino acids (typically hundreds or thousands). But proteins are complicated molecules that can adopt many possible shapes. The shape of a protein largely underlies its function. Currently we don't understand how to accurately predict a shape or the functional attributes of a protein just by knowing it's amino acid sequence. Also, protein misfolding is a contributory factor in many human diseases. To further our understanding and prediction of protein folding, we can harness distributed computing tools. This will help advance biomedical technology.

Half the posts on this thread seem to be bickering about whether or not Ross is still charged with attempted murder-for-hire or not. 
Here's a [definitive]( statement on that straight from the horse's mouth.
In summary:
- There was never any evidence presented by the FBI in indictments that any actual homicides took place.
- Formal murder for hire charges were dropped in the NY indictment. The current indictment Ross was arraigned for simply mentions one count of attempted murder for hire as an 'uncharged crime'.
- Originally there were six formal counts of murder for hire in the NY indictment. Now there are none.
- There remains one formal count of murder for hire in the MD criminal indictment. Ross has not been arraigned for this yet. Probably won't be until the NY case is over with. Until the arraignment happens, this indictment could be altered like the NY one was.
The defense attorney notes that indictments are often overinflated in order to besmirch a defendant's name or to help deny them bail (this makes it much harder for them to prepare a defense). The evidentiary burden for an indictment is very low, so it's more of a throw-everything-against-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks approach by the prosecution. He speculates that's partially what happened here. 
Certainly, this would be consistent with the behaviour of bringing the attempted murder-for-hire charges and subsequently dropping them. Personally I agree with this assessment that it was a malicious strategy aimed at getting his bail denied. Ross's bail was set at over $1m USD and his family and friends scraped it together from their savings. Hard to argue flight risk with that kind of scrill on the line, so if they wanted to deny bail, instead they would have had to make him out to look like a danger to society.
Some people on this subreddit seem satisfied with what was presented in the indictments, and take the FBI at their word. That's fine. I have read the original indictment and if the evidence was not fabricated or misinterpreted, or based on entrapment, it certainly would not look good (even though no homicides actually seem to have occurred).
But I also sympathize with the opposing viewpoint, that does not believe the government's claims. When the government lies as much as it does, it would seem naive indeed to take their claims as gospel truth. And I don't think anyone would dispute that the American justice system is irretrievably flawed and uses extremely malicious tactics. I find it very suspicious that the majority of the attempted murder-for-hire charges have already been dropped.
I'm not sure how much good it does to bicker about this. Neither viewpoints will be substantiated until such time that the government is compelled to present their full evidence regarding the alleged crime, and the defense is allowed to see this evidence and mount a response. Simple due process, people. Until he's convicted of a murder-for-hire crime, he's still presumed innocent.
The above judicial process is incredibly important in getting at the truth of the matter either way.
So what I really take issue with is people demonizing the contribution of money to Ross's legal fund. The very legal fund that will help to ensure good legal clash in this case, and help to get at the truth whichever way it could end up going. There is absolutely nothing wrong with trying to assist these legal endeavours. He should get a fair trial.

I agree with you that there is a lot of artificial selling pressure because of the issues. I don't think this is a grand central bank conspiracy, or even a ploy by Karpeles.

That's not to say that I think it's *wise* or *advised* to perform such a transaction as a seller, so I think we do agree there. And, if demonstrable harm occurs as a direct result of the sale, I do feel that the seller could be held liable in some way. Which goes back to it not being wise to engage in such activities, because you could be opening yourself up to criminal or civil liability.
So, in my opinion, selling bitcoins for dollars to an informant who expresses the desire to purchase stolen credit card info with these bitcoins should not be any grounds for prosecution. And in fact, from what I can tell, they're not using it as such. The prosecution stems from the fact that the amount of the transaction was high enough to trigger MSB registration and AML/KYC reporting, which the seller did not perform. The part thrown in about the informant's remarks regarding intent to engage in criminal behavior was, in my opinion, just to color the defendant as a bad/dangerous individual. In other words, to besmirch his name by association with criminal enterprise (which is actually specious and fictitious, as the buyer/informant had no real intention of committing the crimes, and these crimes never occurred). It seems this is a common tactic for swaying judges and juries (as well as media and the public).
Even if the buyer had been real, and had in fact used the bitcoins to purchase stolen CC info and then had made some swindles, I still don't think that's sufficient to prosecute the seller. This is because: 1) The bitcoins were not directly involved in producing harm 2) The bitcoins were not sufficient for performing the criminal act-- the stolen CC info was the key ingredient 3) The buyer having bitcoins does not result in an imminent threat of a harm being realized, there are still additional steps necessary 4) The bitcoins were incidental, not indispensable, to performing the criminal act-- stolen CC info can be acquired by other means.
And if the issue were to be pressed, I don't even know if criminal liability would be the best way to deal with such a situation. Probably civil liability would make more sense.
Sorry if my language was imprecise before. It's difficult to concisely express opinions about such abstractions and theoreticals. And it can be rather tiresome too. I can totally see now why the state's approach is to arrest 'em all and let god sort it out.

I certainly don't think your experience would be all that uncommon. I went to public school as well, and felt that a lot of it was a waste of time, or not particularly conducive to learning efficiently or effectively. And I also look back on it now and feel like there was a lot of indoctrination about politics/economics and worldview in general.
For certain disciplines that really lend themself to autodidacticism (such as computers), I agree with you that college can be a waste of time too. But speaking for myself, as a laboratory scientist, I think it might be more difficult to be self-taught in this discipline. And luckily I had a good scholarship so I never really had to weigh whether or not getting an education would be worth it, monetarily.

I also was wondering about the safety of this method, Canton. Doing a quick napkin-back calculation on the minability should be fairly straightforward.
We'd need to know:
- How many bills are currently in circulation? (i.e. how many serial numbers, *n*)
- How many combinations are possible (this should just be *n* cubed for a three serial number concatenation)
- How many iterations per second can a brainwallet miner process?
I'll update this post if I arrive at any numbers.
I suppose if the method is determined to be too weak, there's always the option of adding pieces of salt, like one's full name and telephone number and mother's maiden name, and concatenating that onto the serial number sequence.
From this [website]( we can estimate that using smaller bills, (1s, 2s, 5s, and 10s), there are about 12 billion serial numbers of those types currently in circulation. But bills are removed from circulation all the time due to being worn, thus the possible serial-space is larger than the number of bills currently in circulation at any given time. Let's just up the serial space to 20 billion to account for this phenomenon. I am also assuming serial numbers follow predictable, sequential patterns here so that it should be feasible to build a plausible list of serials to pull from, simply knowing the rough number of bills in circulation. [EDIT: I finally did find a [site]( listing some serial number ranges] So, using the 3-bill regime, that makes 8000000000000000000000000000000 or eight nonillion combinations. 
says [here]( that a high-end FPGA farm could process a billion iterations per second potentially. Of course this is likely not including the time it takes to check each iteration against addresses in the blockchain to look for value. But we ought to neglect this delay time and assume it is nigh-instantaneous. Because in reality, the attack surface is much smaller for high-value addresses (let's assume big paydays are really what the attacker is after). As says [here]( an attacker can just use public blockchain data to maintain a list of high-value addresses that their script checks against. So, let's just go with billion iterations per second.
That means the entire search space takes 8000000000000000000000000000000/1000000000, or 8000000000000000000000 (eight sextillion) seconds, which is [18000 times the age of the universe](
Anyone feel free to correct me if I've erred or made faulty assumptions.
EDIT 2: 
A different calculation methodology:
We can calculate a higher bound on serial space just using OP's method of 3 bills that are either 1 or 2 dollar bills. 1 and 2 dollar bills all have 10-char serial numbers of the form : 
[A-L] [0-9] [0-9] [0-9] [0-9] [0-9] [0-9] [0-9] [0-9] [A-Y, excluding O] 
Which means there are [26.4 billion]( serials possible and thus [~18.4 nonillion]( concatenatory combinations (C) of three bills possible. (this is assuming we always separate the serials with one period, which adds no additional entropy).
Converting that to bits of entropy using the formula:
^log 2 ^(C)
we get [103.86]( bits of entropy at most. Which is considered 'strong' according to [this website]( 
However, someone who [looked at what ranges have actually been issued]( or performed analytics (e.g. weighting older bills' serials with a lower probability of inclusion) could probably shave that down a fair amount.
So, perhaps the method is safer if we add a fourth 1 or 2 dollar bill. This raises upper bound BOE to ~138.
In addition, some kind of personalized passphrase (salt) concatenated onto the serial sequence would be advisable I think. It's not like that's too difficult, and it makes your brainwallet that much stronger.

This is an awesome and noble goal, but as many are pointing out, the project seems a bit embryonic at this stage, without a working codebase to audit. And creating this is going to be the really tough part. The devil's in the details.
This announcement, more than anything, reflects that there are a lot of people that (correctly) feel the urgency for a more decentralized, censorship-free internet. Further, the people of seem quite eager to embrace such a thing (unsurprising).
Just recently we learned about the next-gen PirateBrowser project on Which sounds like a cool initiative, but unfortunately was a bit lacking in details. Nonetheless it spurred a lot of thought on everyone's part, and, I think, a renewed interest in learning about these types of systems, which was fun. I'll definitely be following it as more info is released.
Also recently on we learned about another protocol for decentralized, encrypted file storage (which could presumably be built upon to enable a new, decentralized, Dropbox/Facebook/Youtube/Spotify) -- called Maidsafe. Although, the post didn't get nearly as much traction. But the project has been in development for years now, and seems pretty far along. I think it's worth taking a look at. Developer's post is [here]( and there's documentation [here]( Their site is [here]( and there's an intro/overview video [here]( The system doesn't require meshnet, but it doesn't preclude it either. In fact, if Maidsafe file storage were widely adopted and then obviated the need for centralized servers, I think it could make a transition to a meshnet system much smoother.
And of course, there are already some similar protocols for decentralized internet and file storage in use right now, such as Freenet, I2P, and Tahoe-LAFS.
Anyway, it's great that a lot of different people are thinking about how to tackle the problem of creating something like this. Should be interesting to see if any of these projects really start to take off!

I don't think such a huge price drop was even a rational reaction to Mt Gox's withdrawal suspension.  It's probably just the usual suspects of random FUDsters trying to capitalize on this, and sow panic and uncertainty. 
Although it's certainly an interesting theory that the IMF is somehow behind this, I really don't think the dots connect. I don't think it's some shadowy conspiracy. Probably just FUDsters out for a buck.

Yeah, the part that reeks the most to me is  (An increase in the size of the financial industry with respect to all other economic activity) a.k.a. 'they paved paradise and put up a hedge fund'. I think that this is symptomatic of a system where it's become easy, due to central bank policy, for certain institutions line up at the front of the trough and then skim off large sums of money as it travels from out of the central bank to the larger economy.
Now that's not to say that the underlying function that hedge funds and other financial actors play is inherently bad. But I agree it has gotten out of control. And if you trace it back, I think it is monetary policy that is at the root of it.

I really love the concept of quid-pro-quo use of the network, in that I can 'purchase' storage space on the network not with fees, but by dedicating some of my hard drive storage space to serve as a maidsafe 'vault' for the storage of other users' data.
It sounds like there will be a high degree of redundancy built into the data storage mechanism, to ensure that data will be reclaimable even with nodes joining and leaving the network at all times.
In light of this redundancy multiplier effect on the storage requirements for data, what do you estimate will be the ratio for storage provided versus storage privilege earned? If I contribute a 1TB vault, do I get 1TB or storage? Or, do I get 600GB? Or 300GB? Can the ratio be improved upon by automatically compressing all files prior to parceling them up, encrypting them, and broadcasting them to the network? Will the storage space I earn be dependent on the degree of compressibility of my files then?
I'm also wondering about continuity of my earned storage space, even if my contributed vault(s) leave the network for whatever reason. Say I run a node on the maidsafe network where I am contributing 1TB as a vault for other users, and in so doing, have earned x*1TB of storage space (where x is the aforementioned ratio). What if I have an interruption in internet connection, or a power outage, or some other kind of force majeure? The vault I was running is now no longer accessible to the users who had their stuff on it, perhaps for some long duration of time. Now, is my data stored on other peoples' vaults still safe? Or will it get deleted eventually since I am no longer providing storage in exchange? 
Perhaps one solution to this issue is to have some sort of ledger that tracks the GB-hours (or whichever data size*time measure) contributed by each user (similar to how some private torrent websites do). That way, a given user can build up 'credits' in the system to ensure their data is safe even if they aren't contributing vault storage to the network 24/7. Is this what will be done, or is there some other solution you all have come up with?

Oh yeah I was pretty pissed about the Casascius/FinCEN thing as well. Went on a seething [rant]( and then proceeded to have a protracted [argument]( against "geekygirl23".
As for the money transmitter (a.k.a. money service business) issue, I think who is and who isn't an MSB is basically an impossibility to determine. There are multiple definitions of MSB in the federal code. Some of these definitions use overbroad, vague language. 
Additionally, I think there are also something like 48 state jurisdictions that regulate MSBs as well, using their own state laws, that have their own language defining what an MSB is. 
In other words, it is a complete clusterfuck. 
So if you had a fledgling business you thought *might* fall under MSB laws, and you consulted a lawyer, I bet they'd just tell you to register. There's really no way to be certain you *don't* fall under the law, according to the capricious standpoints of FinCEN, or prosecutors, or whatever agency.
Here's some more fun factoids:
* Under 18 USC 1960, failure to register as a MSB with FinCEN is a federal crime
* Under 18 USC 1960, failure to register as a MSB with *individual states* you conduct business in is also a federal crime
* Nobody can say for sure what an MSB is actually defined as. It has differing definitions depending on which statute you are looking at. If we are to go by 31 CFR 1010.100, it could simply mean "Any other person engaged in the transfer of funds", including through an "informal value transfer system" -- a very expansive definition
* The mens rea requirement ("guilty mind" -- a.k.a. criminal intent) of 18 USC 1960 was stricken by the Patriot Act

They most assuredly should demand this, along with a record of all the captured packets that the FBI claims revealed the IP address. And if the defense hasn't already they ought to find an expert witness who can analyze this and break it down for a judge.
After reading a little bit about the hacking technique (i.e. fuzzing) that it sounds like the FBI employed, I'm not sure if it always involves code injection (although this is certainly a subset of fuzzing). For instance, there could also be a flood of random submissions into the CAPTCHA form that is automated, in an attempt to cause an exception/crash.

OK thanks for clarifying. So if I understand you correctly, if you go to the "Receive Money" tab, all of the coins should still be in the address you originally deposited to?
If Blockchain won't let you spend from that address (maybe due to internal data that thinks you've already spent from that address) then you could try to execute a double-spend.
Go to the import/export tab to find the private key to the address. Then you can import that key to another wallet program and try sending from that address that way. You can just send to a new address you create in your Blockchain wallet if you still want to put them into a sharedsend later.
Alternatively, if you don't want to deal with other wallet software, you could try doing the double-spend just using your web browser. I wrote a primer on how to do this [here]( after I had an issue with stuck coins on Blockchain.

I appreciate your point, but I think it boils down to what is more likely here?
Is it more likely that Gox lost 744K bitcoins due to transaction malleability attacks (as was alleged in the document)? Or is it more likely that transaction malleability issues were responsible for some losses, which triggered the realization that there was a longstanding issue with cold wallet retrieval?
I'm inclined to think the latter. Especially if many of the cold wallet bitcoins were squared away in the early days when cold wallet techniques were still being perfected... and Karpeles just assumed them to be retrievable while they were sitting cold for extended periods of time.
I'm inclined to think the latter.
You should read the theory spelled out [here]( if you have not already done so. It makes more sense than anything I've read so far. If we are to believe that the 'Crisis strategy' did indeed originate from Mt Gox though, we're still left with the question of why they made the outrageous claim of huge losses due to transaction malleability. If they were involved in writing the document, and it is indeed a cold wallet issue, then why would they misrepresent the underlying issue? Still a lot of things that don't make sense.

Thus there are [~18.4 nonillion]( concatenations of three bills possible.

Right. All I'm saying is that there's a important difference between being accused of violating AML/KYC/MSB laws, and being accused of money laundering  itself. The AML laws are ancillary laws that make it criminal to engage in behavior that could facilitate money laundering (which is itself the facilitation of actual crime), but it is distinct from money laundering itself. 
But from researching the Shrem case, I agree with you. They're trying to prosecute Charlie under the actual money  laundering statute (in addition to the AML/KYC/MSB stuff). In doing so, they are indeed making a dangerous precedent that pre-crime is punishable under the money laundering statute. That is, money laundering no longer is limited to transferring the proceeds of crime, but is also extensible to transferring clean money that *could be used in the future* in commission of a crime (purchasing drugs). It's really terrifying. All the more terrifying because so many citizens seem to agree with this warped definition.

OK, just to clear up the confusion, here's a [blogpost]( from freeross.org that's edifying in that regard.
Yes, the New York indictment currently contains no formal murder-for-hire charges. At one point there were six such charges, but now it has been downgraded to, as you point out, one 'uncharged crime' mentioned in a NY indictment.
However, there **is** still one outstanding murder-for-hire indictment in Maryland - as a formal charge. We shouldn't dismiss it outright, but neither should we outright believe it. An indictment requires a very low evidentiary burden. So I'm afraid the only way to better illuminate the truth will be to have both sides present their case in the Maryland court.
So TLDR you and are both part correct.

After looking through the NeoBee website, I think they are purposely not trying to explicitly offer any kind of 'investment advice'. Likely because doing so opens up a new can of regulatory worms.
What they *will* do is consult with individuals, and help them to understand the technology behind bitcoin, the protocol-enforced mechanisms of its fixed supply, and the implications of widespread adoption. They can let the consumer make an informed choice of whether they want to buy bitcoin based on the info (even if it *is*, for this individual a speculative-type investment). That being said, they have to tread very lightly and make sure that they are not guaranteeing any kind of gains, or directly promoting bitcoin as a surefire investment vehicle. It seems the angle they're working more, is that bitcoin is a great way to transact in an unfettered manner, and to store value safely. And for some who understand the risks involved, it *can* be a viable investment strategy as well.
They're not going to tell people that fiat money is becoming worthless. Indeed, they don't need to. This is Cyprus after all, and so that sentiment is pretty widespread already.
At some point Neo will begin to offer time-locked bitcoin accounts, where there is a set time period for maturation, and some risk mitigation is provided to the consumer on condition of sharing of possible gains. I think Neo is waiting to roll this out until there are more avenues available for bitcoin options + derivatives trading so that they can hedge their risk better.

There's many  interesting parts to this sentence.
1) It explains why Professor Athey seemed all shilly-willy for Ripple at the NY DFS hearings.
2) IIRC RippleLabs actually never claimed that Ripple (or XRPs) was a competing cryptocurrency. In fact, they used to claim that XRPs were not a currency at all, but simply an anti-spam mechanism in the Ripple networks analogous to a postage stamp. Have they changed their tune, or is the author just applying the terminology of cryptocurrency generously? 
3) Putting aside whether or not Ripple considers them a cryptocurrency -- should Ripples (XRPs) even be classed as one?  lists it as one... but they also differentiate between mineable and non-mineable, which you can toggle (Ripple is of course the latter). I don't think being mineable is a necessary criteria of cryptocurrency. I'm not even sure what the exact criteria should be. I'll ask everyone here: do you think XRPs satisfy the criteria of a cryptocurrency?

So you mean what are the chances that hackers took all of Gox's bitcoins using the malleability exploit? Very unlikely I think. If everything was on one hot wallet, I think it would still have been difficult to clean them out entirely before they noticed something. But I believe Gox had multiple cold wallets, as any company of that size should have. Surely if they had to dip into a cold wallet before they expected to need to, it would have alerted them that something was up, long before they became in danger of insolvency.

Oh, you mean Anwar Al-Awlaki? Great, not this again. 
I can't believe people are still claiming his due process was violated when the government has clearly stated *multiple times* that it wasn't... Let it go already. If the government says due process was satisfied, then I believe them. You think you know more about due process than they do? They're basically the world experts on due process.
Maybe people aren't used to seeing this kind of due process before. After all, we are fighting a new kind of war these days, on a whole new kind of battlefield. So it necessitates a new kind of due process. And truth be told, this was the kind of special case that required it. 
I mean, what was the government supposed to do? Capture was infeasible. I mean, not really *infeasible* infeasible. But it would've been a real production, and it would have put American boys and girls in harm's way. 
Plus, the nation was in imminent danger! Well, not like *right just then* imminent, but I think there certainly was a pretty good chance of something pretty bad happening at some point in the future. I guess if you think of 'imminent' in more of the geologic sense, then it helps to understand the new kind of war we are fighting. Because it could be a while before we finally prevail (especially if people like you want to tie our government's hands).
Most importantly, Awlaki was just a bad guy! Have you seen his scary beard? I mean, it's not like he exactly *killed* anybody. Oh, but he totally would have, given the chance. And plus, he was encouraging other people to kill Americans. So basically it's the same thing. 
And no, it's not like he had a *trial* exactly, but how was that supposed to happen if he was in Yemen? It's not like he would've even shown up. The Justice Department clearly said that they themselves combed over all the evidence themselves to establish guilt (as if Awlaki would have done this for all of his imminent future victims!). Evidence, that, by the way, should rightly remain classified. In this new kind of war, we can't jeopardize the mission by publicizing sensitive information. 
Anyway, it turned out he was guilty of being a terrorist, and they acted accordingly. 
Sounds fair to me. If you're a terrorist, then you can't hide behind American citizenship. Justice will find you.

In my understanding, there is some concrete evidence that does point to this belief (if only we rephrase it to "BTC was released to the world as a response to the 2008 financial crisis")




Of course this is a bit of a cryptic message to encode in the first block. One parsimonious explanation is simply that Satoshi wished to timestamp the genesis block in an old-school way, and that just happened to be on the front page of the Times of London on the day bitcoin began, which was Jan 03, 2009 (similar to how someone might timestamp a photograph by posing with a copy of that day's newspaper). There's not *necessarily* any special meaning embedded in the headline.
However, reading Satoshi's whitepaper, he does mention the explicit goal of disintermediating financial institutions, so the interpretation that he was castigating the legacy financial system with the embedded headline seems entirely plausible.

@_date: 2014-01-28 01:59:00




I'm going to politely suggest that you seek out remedial education in reading comprehension.
"one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business" = **MSB registration**
"one count of willful failure to file a suspicious activity report" = **AML/KYC reporting statutes** 
"one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering". Huh, what's this? Oh! It's the third part of the criminal complaint that I was talking about: **money laundering**. 


So, I actually wasn't trying to ignore this aspect of the law, at all. I was just setting it aside because I was actually conceding that there's probably evidence for contravention of these statutes, *assuming that these statutes actually apply to the defendants*. I was interested in talking about the conspiracy to money laundering charge. Which is actually the part of the criminal complaint that your initial statement, "His [Faiella's] clients were drug dealers, and he knew it.", largely pertained to.
Now as for your other points.


Not so fast. I don't think we can say with certainty that Faiella actually fell under the MSB registration statutes for the majority of the time he was doing business. After all, the whole duration of his business relationship with Shrem was prior to FinCEN even releasing its guidance on digital currencies, I believe. And I might add: these are just guidances, and have not been tested in court yet.


Circumventing reporting laws doesn't automatically mean you are trying to facilitate drug trafficking. The reporting laws are onerous. Faiella and Shrem were clearly just trying to make money, and finding ways to circumvent reporting was primarily a means to that goal, not the goal of facilitating any kind of downstream criminal activity.


Perhaps. But I think it would definitely be harder without it. The circumstantial drug stuff is sure to be more compelling to judges and jurors (not that it ought to be).
This is all likely kind of a moot point though. I doubt this one goes to trial. They'll both probably plea out. The feds are really after their assets, and also making an example of them, and not their heads. I don't think either will do hard time, probably just house arrest or probation, with heavy fines and/or forfeited property.


Pre-FinCEN guidance, no. Post-FinCEN guidance, possibly.

Money laundering is receiving and/or transmitting funds known to be the proceeds of crime. **It is not receiving and/or transmitting funds suspected of being used in futurecrime.**
~~These men were not charged with money laundering, either.~~
EDIT: looks like they were charged with money laundering, and in the case of Reid, at least, there seems to be evidence that he was told by the informant that the money that Reid had accepted was the proceeds of crime, which is above and beyond telling Reid that he just intended to use the bitcoins for crime.

I think I can see where you're coming from. Of course having a reasonable cover story is the best way to cover the tracks of fuckery. I just don't think that's necessarily what's going on.
Besides, even if JPM had a role to play in this, that doesn't mean they colluded with Mt Gox.
They wouldn't even have needed to! The transaction malleability vuln was known about long before Gox announced it. It was publicly accessible to learn about the vuln. Surely the all-powerful bankers could know about it.
No one who perpetrated the attack would have had to have waited until Gox's announcement. They could have started broadcasting a bunch of mutated txid messages to the network at any time, and basically had the same effect!
So the DoS attack vector did not rely on Mt Gox's announcement, nor did it rely on their allowing this problem to fester in their wallet software implementation. After all, the problem affected many more businesses and wallet softwares than just Mt Gox.

You're correct, in a way. It's possible to harvest stem cells from (umbilical) cord blood for example. This does not harm the baby. 
Back in the early days of stem cell research though, most of them were harvested from aborted foetuses, or from embryos created through IVF that were going to be discarded anyway. These are the practices that certain people objected to. 
But more importantly, there's ways around harvesting stem cells from foetuses nowadays. Researchers can harvest skin cells from adult patients and turn them back into stem cells through a process called "induced pluripotency". It's pretty neat. And for stem cells that are intended for therapeutic use, this may be a preferable technique, because the patient's immune system won't recognize these cells as foreign (they are genetically identical to the patient's other somatic cells in every respect that matters).

In the current of representative democracy, people already delegate their votes out to other people. Were you able to vote on the patriot act? No. But your representatives did. 
One reason we have representative democracy in place is because it would be impractical currently for every citizen to vote on every issue or law by ballot. 
Having a cryptographic voting system changes all that. Now the barrier and overhead to voting is a lot lower. The votes are counted automatically and transparently. One should be able to easily audit and verify that their votes were successfully placed and counted. No need to issue paper ballots. It's as easy as building some computer infrastructure and sending out cryptographic vote tokens to each eligible voter, for each issue. 
There could still be voter privacy through a pseudonymous system. The voter knows their pseudonym and can audit their own vote though. 
What's another reason for representative democracy? It's that not every person can be expected to be knowledgeable on every last issue.  Sometimes we would actually prefer to delegate the decision to someone we trust to make it. 
The cryptographic voting system does not preclude this either! I would be able too send my cryptographic vote token to whomever I wanted... not just into one of the vote counter addresses. I could send my vote to a trusted friend, to a relative, even to a public figure. And ask them to make their best decision. 
 So we'd end up with a cool hybrid system of direct and representative democracy. It affords the voter with much more choice. 
I think it's a pretty elegant solution personally. 
Could there be vote selling? Sure. Even under our current systems of representative democracy there's nothing really stopping someone from privately accepting money to vote a certain way. It's just that one can't prove to the buyer that the desired vote was cast. 
 But under a crypto vote system I doubt it would be all that widespread. Even though it would allow proof that the vote was cast in a desired way.  It could still be illegal to do so and thus discouraged.

You make a good point. Bitcoin mining hardware certainly has gotten orders of magnitude more energy-efficient. And that's good in a way. But in the long run, difficulty adjustments mean you just need more of these high-efficiency machines running to get the same slice of the pie, so some of the initial energy efficiency gain is eventually lost in that fashion. And upward price swings will incentivize more miners to run more machines on the network as well.
Contrastingly, some altcoins use mining algorithms that prove more difficult to engineer more efficient mining solutions for. Or, at least, there is less incentive to produce really efficient miners because the market cap is much lower on these alts than for bitcoin. 
Scrypt-based coins for one. Indeed, shibes of the dogecoin community don't seem to *want* mining to fall into the hands of more efficient machines, because they intend for the currency generation to remain as democratized as possible.
Then there's even other algorithms being rolled out in newer alts that should prove more difficult still to make efficient. Such as memory-intensive algos like 'Slasher' which Ethereum is planning to implement.
So, yeah, heater heaters will always specialize in heating. But if you're cryptomining anyway, might as well make use of the heat generated in some way. No matter the efficiency gains, cryptominers always be throwin off heat. By ordering our public ledgers, they must emit disorder into their environments (my bastardized take on the 2nd law).

That's the best rebuttal you can come up with? I think it's a rather shit analogy for multiple reasons.
1) Someone can be victimized with a handgun. Someone cannot be victimized with a bitcoin. Important difference. Any possible downstream harm that could come about from selling someone bitcoin is necessarily much more abstracted from the initial bitcoin sale, meaning the bitcoins are a minor player-- they do not play a central or even an indispensable role in the realized harm.
 The same cannot be said for the handgun.
2) Your example seems to involve an actual downstream crime being committed, rather than some as-yet-uncertain futurecrime (otherwise, why would we be in court?)
 In your example, I still don't think the act *itself* of selling this person a handgun is or should be illegal, (absent any resultant harms). It is up to the seller's discretion. I want to emphasize here that I'm not saying the seller *should* make the sale under the circumstances. I'm just saying that they ought not to be under any legal obligation to refuse the transaction. (Although they could be opening themselves up to criminal liability later on by going forward).
Now, that being said, under the circumstances, I think it would be very ill-advised for the seller to go through with it. Not only because it's sketchy and it sounds as if there is imminent physical harm to another person that could result, but because if this happens, I think the seller could indeed be found in some way liable for the death.
If I was on the jury, my thought process would be:
- The handgun was central to the committed crime
- There was reason to believe the buyer, with a handgun, would present an imminent threat to ex-wife
- The seller was informed of this when he exercised his discretion
- The seller thus took an informed risk of there being direct downstream harm inflicted by an object he proceeded to sell
- The seller should be held in part liable for the harms

Hi Mr Wales, thanks for stopping by. 
One cool thing about bitcoins is they work well for small donations. With ordinary payment processors, a significant share of small donations can get eaten up due to fees. With bitcoin, fees are tiny. 
In theory, you could set up a separate donation address for every single wikipedia page, and put a little donation button on the top of it. That way, if users found a given article particularly useful, they can chip in a few cents, or a few bucks, whatever. With a site as huge as Wikipedia, I think lots of little donations could add up real quick. Also, it could enable some fun metrics, like which pages receive the most bitcoin donations? It could be a fun way for contributors to get internet street cred if the pages they contribute to are well-received and get lots of tips.
Such a system would merge very synergistically with certain browser extensions like KryptoKit, which is a wallet that will automatically scan pages for bitcoin addresses and allow you to send coins to them seamlessly.
It would work very similarly to Flattr (if you've heard of it). Flattr can also be used for microdonations (it's denominated in euros), and can also be used to tip individual content pages on a larger site. But, they charge a 10% fee.
I dunno, just a crazy idea!

Yes, I agree with you-- it's lamentable that they were forced to sell most of the coins at below-market value due to Hal's medical situation. And I'd happily contribute if there was a donation address. I think we'd be hard-pressed to find someone more deserving.
Although, it's doubtful that Hal himself will be able to enjoy any wealth obtained from a donation address (I imagine he'd appreciate the gesture though). It sounds like Hal has lived with ALS for 5 years now, and that is usually on the high end of life expectancies for someone with the disease. And he's already on a ventilator-- this is one of the more terminal stages. If I had to make an educated guess, I think it's likely he might pass before the year is up. 
So I suppose it would be more like a donation to his next-of-kin. I wonder what his family would think of a donation fund? I'm not sure whether or not they really need the money, or if they would accept it. But even if they didn't, maybe they would accept donations in his name. Like, for an ALS charity like ALSA or Compassionate Care ALS. Or maybe a scholarship in Hal's name or something. Like, for libertarian-leaning students interested in going into the cryptography field? Imagine that!

I don't think such a situation would warrant a money laundering charge. Money laundering is receiving and/or transmitting funds known to be the proceeds of crime. It is not receiving and/or transmitting funds suspected of being used in futurecrime.
That's not to say that if a downstream crime did occur, and was greatly facilitated by the transaction, that the seller could not be held criminally or civilly liable. But that's not a slam dunk either, it's hard to prove.
One thing it is certainly *not* is money laundering.
EDIT: Looking at the affidavits, I think there actually may be a case for money laundering under [this Florida statute]( in Reid's case at least (but not for Espinoza's). There were some details I had missed previously.

Another interesting tidbit can be found in the [affidavit]( as a footnote on Section 9:


indicated in the June 12 Request. See Ex. A, at 1. (A Tor “bridge” is a private Tor node that can be used to access the Tor network, as opposed to using a public Tor node that could be detected on one’s Internet traffic.
See Tor: Bridges, available at 
**To be clear, however, the traffic data obtained for Server-1 did not reflect any connection to, or otherwise lead to the identification of, the Subject IP Address. The Subject IP Address was independently identified solely by the means described above – i.e. , by examining the traffic data sent back from the Silk Road website when we interacted with its user login interface.**
It sounds like they are emphasizing here that there was a clean evidence gathering trail that led to the identification of the SR Server, a.k.a. Subject IP, (which they got the Icelandic police to image) -- consistent with their leaky CAPTCHA narrative. And he claims this later identification was carried out "independently" of the "Server-1" investigation... (really?)
Then they never explain how the so-called "Server-1", located in the same Icelandic datacentre as the SR Server, was identified! Even though it seems to have been a major clue for them (it was evidently a bridge relay for the SR server), and it hardly makes sense that the successful SR Server identification was completely "independent" of this line of evidence. So, was this Server-1 investigation carried out legally? What means did they use to identify it?

@_date: 2014-03-11 12:06:54
There is, actually. 
A little background first: protein engineering is a hard scientific problem currently. And a lot of therapeutic engineered proteins derive their usefulness from binding to another protein target very specifically, and very strongly. Typically if you're trying to engineer a protein that has a high binding affinity to a target, you need to harness high degrees of randomness in order to pull out something useful. 
One approach is to harness the randomness already used by organisms. You can inject an animal with an antigen and then let their immune system naturally produce antibodies that bind to the target, which you then select for. The process by which new antibodies are made is essentially a stochastic recombination of different protein segments that generates a huge repertoire of possible binding affinities, so this tends to work pretty well. 
There are also ways to recapitulate such random selection in vitro, by synthetically generating large libraries of protein variants based on a single protein scaffold, and then screening them for the desired binding properties. Since protein folding is not very well understood, these 'randomness' approaches usually produce the best results currently.
Another up-and-coming approach is known as 'rational design'. This means leveraging what *is known* currently about protein folding and protein-protein docking in order to make educated guesses about how to design proteins with the desired properties. Often times this approach is used to generate a 'first draft' and then random screens are utilized afterwards to further optimize the protein.
How can we make this process better? One approach is to further our understanding of the protein folding process, and how proteins interact with one another. For instance, the holy grail of protein folding is to develop algorithmic heuristics that can do so-called 'ab initio' structure prediction with high accuracy. This means, inputting a string of amino acids (essentially, this is what a protein is) and being able to predict how it will fold into a globular protein shape.
Predictably, some of the best tools for advancing our knowledge of this are taking advantage of crowdsourcing, and distributed computing.
A lab at UW Seattle produced a crowdsourcing game where you can compete to fold a protein into the most energetically favourable configuration, it's called [Fold-it]( I've not played it before, but evidently it's not something you need a biology background in order to play. After a while, people just seem to 'grok' certain strategies for protein folding. In turn, the data generated by players can be used to develop better computational algorithms for protein folding.
On the distributed computing side, there's [Rosetta developed by the same lab at UW. While your computer's not in use, you can donate CPU/GPU time to run folding algorithms that iterate different folds and calculate how energetically favourable they are. There's also another project called [Folding which was developed by a Stanford lab, that does similar work.

Ok, I think I finally get it...
An attacker requests a withdrawal from Gox.
Mt Gox signs the transaction, and records in their internal records what they expect the txid will be.
The attacker monitoring transactions broadcasted by Gox takes the signed transaction, modifies it slightly so that it will still be valid, but results in a different txid.
The attacker rebroadcasts this altered transaction to the network, in the hope that it will propagate faster than Gox's and be the one that gets solidified into the blockchain.
If the attacker succeeds, then Gox's internal records will indicate that the transaction never went through (they are searching the blockchain for what they *thought* the txid should be). But in fact, it did go through.
Attacker claims they never got their coins, and ask Gox to reperform the transaction. Attacker has now doubled their money.

I think you may misunderstand the purpose of RICO. It's not to prosecute people who are extracting money from plaintiffs. It's to prosecute the higher-ups in a criminal organization that order crimes (of many different natures) to be committed by underlings. RICO could be a way to launch civil suits against currently untouchable people like Michael Hayden, James Clapper, Keith Alexander.
One federal judge said LAPD could be prosecuted under RICO. So perhaps it could extend to other government agencies.

I know that's a lot of ifs and ands. Such an implemenation might not be that successful today. But if bitcoin and bitcoin-integrated browser extensions become more widely adopted and widespread, I think it could be a hit.

You may in fact be wrong on this. I believe that Satoshi and/or the early core devs left it this way by design... If I recall correctly, this configuration is what allows for the [ANYONECANPAY]( argument for tx signing. This is the transaction signing case that is utilized by Peter Todd's popular script [dust-b-gone](
Further, I don't think there's any intention now of changing the multiple valid signatures bug (or feature) itself. Notice that the fixes to the transaction malleability issue instead are revolving around making the software built on top of the core layer use different methods of tracking transactions that are in fact unique.
But I could be wrong here. Someone with better knowledge of the internals please jump in.

You brought up some great points, and I  agree with what you're getting at here.
But I think Digital-Tokyo is saying that technologies such as email, youtube, and bitcoin provide improvements over the previously dominant technologies besides just circumventing government edicts or government-enforced monopolies. Like for bitcoin, the ability to reach a consensus among strangers, in a trustless fashion. That is cool regardless of its import with respect to circumventing government controls. And it definitely wasn't possible before bitcoin.
Now, you could argue that we'd have no need for such a system if governments were perfect, wise, incorruptible, and made up of true Philosopher-Kings. But I don't think anyone here is arguing that governments are like that.
And in essence, the corollary to what you're saying here is that government actually is spurring innovation because of their restrictive policies. Would bitcoin have been invented in the absence of the government-enabled stagnancy in financial innovation and the corruption of the banking cartel? Who knows. I'm certainly not thanking the world's governments for doing all the shitty things that led up to bitcoin, but it's something interesting to ponder. Just as in nature, selective pressure can produce some marvelous creations.

I think everything that's happened in the past year could be indicative of a power struggle going on between some of the major bitcoin players right now, and also between factions within the Foundation. And TBI is probably a pawn in this chess game. It seems like there has been a concerted campaign to not only take down certain players, but also to do it in such a way that brings on the prospect of more laws, more regulation, and more Americentricity. 
With the news that the Foundation is cooperating heavily with the Southern District of New York (i.e. Preet Bharara) on the Gox case, I think some majorly shady ish has been going down. Not only do certain seats on the Foundation (and other major bitcoin players) have a vested interest in seeing Gox go down in flames, but so does the US government. Being based in Tokyo, Gox is more out of reach of their tentacles, and less permeable to their influence. US government power has already been wielded against Mt Gox in a fashion that would exceed any kind of reasonable measures. I'm referring to the asset seizure of their US bank accounts (5.5 million) here. 
I don't know man. Just seems like a lot of shady and underhanded shit going on. Hopefully the truth will out.

* "RICO also permits a private individual harmed by the actions of such racketeers to file a civil suit"
* "**Los Angeles Police Department**:
In April, 2000, Federal judge William J. Rea in Los Angeles, ruling in one Rampart Scandal case, said that the plaintiffs could pursue RICO claims against the LAPD, an unprecedented finding. The idea that a police organization could be characterized as a racketeering enterprise shook up City Hall and further damaged the already tarnished image of the LAPD. However, in July, 2001, U.S. District Judge Gary A. Feess said that the plaintiffs do not have standing to sue the LAPD under RICO because they are alleging personal injuries rather than economic or property damage."

So this IRS Notice applies to all virtual currencies, right? That's interesting.
There were lots of "virtual currencies" before bitcoin came along. In-game currency for MMORPGs for example.


So if I do asteroid mining in EVE, then is the ISK I receive from that activity considered income too? 
There already is a way to calculate the fair market value of ISK. Because CCP sells PLEX for dollars, and then in game you can sell a PLEX for ISK, that provides a way to calculate a USD&lt;&gt;ISK exchange rate.

Yep. The thing about that is, I think it could be argued that a bad bitcoin transaction privacy implementation ends up being worse than nothing at all.
It provides a false sense of security, may incur additional fees and processing time, and further, the transaction pattern could attract additional scrutiny.
And in the end, if it's a reversible privacy strategy, then it's useless. This is because all the blockchain data is public... forever. If it's possible that the privacy algorithm can be reversed at any point in the future, then it will be, and the transactions will be analyzable again. 
The argument of 'safety in numbers' for this type of thing doesn't make much sense to me either. If someone writes a script that can use a good heuristic to reverse the privacy of the transactions, then the analysis can now be automated and then the results posted publicly. And consequently now *all* the weak privacy is as good as gone (it's just a question of when). 
@_date: 2014-02-27 10:06:42

This is not my field but I'll try to answer best I can.
I'm not sure if ab initio protein folding is *completely* solvable. Because in reality, there's a lot of factors external to the primary sequence of a protein that will influence it's folding. Post-translational modifications, cofactors, chaperone proteins, just off the top of my head. But the point is, there's probably a lot of room for improvement currently in our computation approaches to structure prediction.
For small-length chains, yeah, it's much more straightforward. As you continue to add amino acids to the polymer, it adds more and more degrees of freedom, more possible permutations for the structure. It exponentially expands the landscape of potential structures that could be adopted. But small protein chains *do* exist in vivo! In fact they do lots of important things. Neuropeptides come to mind (literally).
I think the most difficult part is just the vast ocean of possibilities of different conformations that could exist for a reasonably-sized protein. An understanding of common domain folds certainly helps to get a rough shape for a prediction, but the devil's in the details. Minor structural refinements can matter a lot in terms of protein function. But understanding common domains can't always bail you out. Bioinformatics/bioprospecting has dredged up a lot of data about primary protein sequences from various microorganisms and such, and we have no idea what shape a lot of these proteins should adopt. There's only so many protein structures that have been solved by crystallography or NMR or whatever. And the other thing is, with engineering synthetic proteins, sometimes you're trying to engineer a fold that doesn't really have a known counterpart in nature. That's where better ab initio capabilities can help us out.

The author rightly trumpets how bitcoin can help the world's 'unbanked' but then uses that as an argument for how Washington needs to develop sensible and consistent policy towards bitcoin:


Does Washington's policy really matter a whole hell of a lot for the majority of people that bitcoin can uplift through easy access to financial services (mostly people that live outside the US)? I honestly think they could give a damn what some bureaucrats in DC say.
Although I will concede that as the world hegemon, US policy does have a more prominently enforced agenda on the world stage. But still, I argue that it doesn't matter for most of the people that can avail themselves of a new cryptocurrency-based economy. There's already a *thriving* worldwide grey market (the so-called 'Système D') that gives zero fucks whatsoever about the edicts of America.
I mean, overall it was a good article, but I think the argument is a little bit flawed.

I think 5 is definitely not impossible. 
The reason is because lots and lots of new random bitcoin addresses can be generated per second with powerful enough computers. And you can write a script to check each new created address against matching some pattern you're interested in. (This is how people make so-called 'vanity addresses' for themselves, like "1Ross5Np5doy4ajF9iGXzgKaC2Q3Pwwxv" which says 'Ross'). With each new character that must be matched, it becomes exponentially more difficult.
Interestingly enough, the [address generation work]( is similar to bitcoin mining in a way, because they both make use of cryptographic hashes. In fact, one step in address creation is the same algorithm (SHA256) as mining.
However, you actually cannot use ASICs to compute new addresses, because bitcoin ASICs can only do SHA256, and address creation requires additional algos. A good GPU cluster however, could I think be used to create addresses rapidly.
Given a nice rig and a little bit of time, 5 characters matching is not hard. But due to the exponential nature of difficulty to match a longer pattern, I think if you get to the 8-9 range, then it would be impractical. 
Maybe someone who knows how to calculate about how long 5, 8, and 9 would take on an average GPU rig can chime in?

I hope that a lot of the people who patronize Neo/Bee will in so doing learn more about controlling their bitcoin finances themselves when they feel ready to. I think NeoBee is fully supportive of this as well. More than just being a business out to make money, I feel they really want to spur the growth of the technology, and peoples' familiarity with it, as much as possible. Rather than just risk-mitigation, I think they're also serving as 'training wheels' for new bitcoiners.

The feds will probably get a conviction by reaching a plea deal. I really doubt this will ever go to trial. They have a possible 30 years of prison time to hold over Shrem's head, until he acquiesces. 
Regardless of the outcome of the criminal proceedings... it looks like civil asset forfeiture laws were invoked to dispossess Shrem of property and/or bank accounts. That will prove much harder for Shrem to fight. These civil asset forfeiture proceedings are truly a stacked deck.
And the assets are really what the government is after. It's for-profit policing.

I'm not saying there is a 'conspiracy against bitcoin'! You are putting words in my mouth.
The *stated reason* is to stop money laundering, which is a fictitious crime that was made up a few decades ago.
I'm just saying that there are other, equally important motives at play here. Civil asset forfeiture statutes, which were greatly bolstered after 9.11, create a very large incentive for the feds to make up excuses prosecute and seize assets. The proceeds of these seized assets are used to fund the departments or even enrich the individual police or agents involved in the investigations.
And the end of the justice.gov press release I quoted stated plainly that there is an aspect of asset forfeiture in this case, likely civil, because that is permitted now for alleged violators of MSB statutes. For instance, it was used by the feds to privateer millions of dollars out of two of Mt Gox's (Mutum Sigillum's, tbmp) United States bank accounts. 
Of course, these statutes are typically used against people who have enough assets to make the privateering worth it, but are still small enough fish not to be part of 'the club'. Like HSBC. I mean, HSBC was fined, but they weren't completely expropriated, like I assume Shrem and Faiella will be (at least to the extent that they can be).
Come to your own conclusion of course, but I just think many aspects of the large bitcoin prosecutions (Mt Gox, Silk Road, and now Shrem &amp; Faiella) are all about greed and policing for profit. AML/KYC and MSB statutes have made this so much easier in today's day and age, and policing for profit was essentially codified with the PATRIOT Act after 9.11.
Here's an [outstanding article]( from the New Yorker that ran this summer -- it is a good introduction of the abuse of asset forfeiture statutes in the US. I recommend giving it a read.

How are these beliefs even compatible? If it's doomed to fail, then how can it be a threat?
It either indicates massive cognitive dissonance, or showcases a deliberate strategy for manipulating the opinions of the widest possible amount of people (confirmation bias for everyone who already has some doubts about bitcoin, and simultaneous scaremongering for anyone who is still on the fence).

Here's something to experiment with: you can try your own CoinJoin transaction (using blockchain.info) and then after it's complete, use blockchain.info to look at your output address. Try to trace the coins all the way to your input. CoinJoin allows for multiple iterations (anywhere from 3-10 is the implementation on blockchain.info IIRC), so the more iterations, the tougher it is to trace back. But it should be possible I think.
The point Andreas was making is that the *amount* of your input transaction into the trustless CoinJoin mixin pool should be roughly the same as your *output amount*-- and this links the pre- and post- CoinJoin addresses if anyone cares to look at the blockchain and try to figure it out.

I'm a little confused on where the 4X number comes from and what it means. 
Does this mean if I store a private file (unique) on the MS network of 1GB, then it requires me to put up 4GB of vault space as 'payment'?
Then, say I share access to this file with another user, then that means that the cost goes down? So essentially MS incentivizes that I make my music library public, or at least share it with friends?
If I share a file with just one other user, does this make the 1:4 cost ratio drop all the way to 1:1? Or just to 1:2?

Hold on... Are you saying you'd be in favour of the US making war against Russia over a violation of the Budapest Memorandum? You think it warrants the US making a nuclear first launch against Russia? I hope I misinterpreted you there.
The Budapest Memorandum is not a mutual defense treaty.  It was not ratified by the Senate. Holding it up as a justification for military aggression against Russia would be a weak casus belli, and furthermore, undemocratic.
In any case, one could make a strong argument that it was the US which broke the terms of the Budapest Memorandum first. You admit that the US State Dept. was funneling money into Ukraine for political ends and trying to foment regime change, and you would have seen them do more of it still. As it turns out, this kind of economic meddling behaviour is forbidden by the very same Memorandum:


Hell you could argue the US government broke this accord way back when they helped to finance and instigate the "Orange Revolution".

You're taking my words out of context. I was referring to the Shrem case there, not TFA.
But you did bring up an interesting aspect of the Florida case there, what with the plant stating his intentions to do bad things down the line.
So I suppose you are arguing that it was the seller's legal duty to halt the transaction right there. Honestly what would be the point, though, of not selling him the bitcoins? He would just go to another seller and not be so blabby.
As far as I know, it is not against the law to sell bitcoins to someone who tells you they plan to do bad things down the line. It sounds like they are actually only able to prosecute him because the *amount* of the transaction was above a certain cutoff that should trigger AML/KYC reporting, as well as MSB registration in FL. (And dude did not follow through on these things, thus he violated the law).

I'm not sure if it would violate a pecuniary interest proscription, necessarily.
I think OP may be just speculating about the possibility of receiving *other peoples'* transaction digests (through radio, or whatever other means, even by sneakernet) and then either serving as the interface between radio/Internet for larger-scale transaction broadcast, or rebroadcasting it thru radio until it hits a radio/Internet node that can broadcast it more fully.
Essentially it sounds like a volunteer operation to try to get transactions broadcasted. The operator doesn't necessarily have any financial stake in it. And, parts of it could be mostly automated, requiring little work on the operator's part.
Not that it would be especially useful to most bitcoiners ATM. But it could be useful in developing nations or remote areas with scarce internet access, or in a SHTF scenario.

If you did want to make a system like I was talking about though (where I can give my vote to someone else if I opt for representative democracy, presumably by transferring them a cryptographic token of some sort), then it should also be possible for someone to buy my vote. They can ensure that the vote was made the way they want, because they in fact get to make the vote.

Although I'd like to see someone come in and unseat Western Union and give them a run for their money (since they've been the beneficiaries of an anticompetitive system for so long), they really are in an enviable position to quickly adapt to and run with a new model here. They already have the groundwork and infrastructure in place (not to mention having their regulatory house in order), it's just a matter of shifting their paradigm. Let's see if they're wise enough to do it. It would be quite something to see Western Union morph into a sort of global crypto-hawaladar that obviates the need for internal trust and accounting auditing in their network. The blockchain can really be a huge tool for them, if they can recognize that.

Yeah what you said makes sense.
I actually did a little more combing through comments after making my post. Although I'm still very confused (so take this with a grain of salt), as I understand it tentatively, there are actually different ways to hop coins between chains. One would be the 'official' exchange rate. This is the mathematically fixed 2-way peg that is determined at the birth of a sidechain. This exchange rate is 'backed' by the bitcoins that are deposited in the sidechain's bitcoin 'vault'. In order to make use of this mechanism, you will have to have your coins buried x amount far in the blockchain of the sidechain (a security feature to be determined also at the time of sidechain creation). This is to ensure against double-spends, and ensure synchrony of the two chains in question (that they both agree the exchange is eligible to take place). However, this 'official' exchange rate doesn't preclude anyone from making use of other sources of liquidity. There is atomic swapping algorithms that can facilitate trading between chains among two untrusting parties. It would also be possible for (decentralized) exchanges to act as market makers and trade facilitators as well I think. This might use atomic coin swapping as well. As for hopping between coins without hopping through bitcoin proper, I think it is possible. This [comment]( from would indicate so.
As for the inflationary sidechain... what I wasn't grokking before was that each sidechain can use their own units of account, but they just have some bitcoin backing to ensure minimum value at any given moment in time. At least I think that's how it goes. Anyway, this would not preclude a system with inflationary issuing of the units of account in a sidechain. In fact, the protocol of the sidechain could specify that the newly created units (maybe they're on a fixed creation schedule, or you could even tie inflation rate to transaction rate or something cray) get sent to an address controlled by some entity (like a national bank). That way, there is inflation, but it is mathematically defined, and the beneficiary of said inflation is also defined via protocol. Could be cool to play around with. It would also be possible to implement a demurrage coin like I was suggesting I think, if one wanted to go that route. And as you point out, I don't think there's anything requiring the peg rate to be a fixed number... it just has to be mathematically defined in some way. So it could float according to some algorithm which would be a different mechanism for depreciating the value of the units over time.
You make good points about a possible bitcoin catastrophe. Ironically the biggest threat to the core bitcoin protocol might actually be the (potential) upgrade that paves the way for sidechains to come about. It would be a major change, so I'm sure it would be done with the utmost care (were it to be done). On the plus side, if you can pull off this change, and still have bitcoin core be running safely and stably, then that *might* be the only major change to bitcoin core you ever have to make. The main devs and upkeepers of the core could focus more assiduously on minor issues with the core, or auditing and re-auditing existing core code to shore it up and make sure everything is bodacious. They wouldn't have to constantly review new proposals to change the bitcoin core after that, because the further innovation would be pushed more to the fringes (the sidechains).

That was probably the reason, but I can't imagine anything in the terms which would contain an umbrella ban on such transactions. More likely the bank views it as suspicious and are opting at their discretion to terminate the account, in accordance with the terms set forth.  They probably fear that 'irregular' transactions such as this could open them up to scrutiny and liability under possible AML reasons. And the amount of money in question is certainly not enough to make any possible money laundering going on worth their while.

I still don't get how Faiella did anything seriously wrong (or by extension, Shrem), aside from maybe breaking AML and reporting statutes (not that I consider that sort of thing to be morally wrong).
I mean, the Silk Road was at its core a technologically advanced escrow and customer feedback system facilitating an online marketplace economy. Besides banning certain types of goods (weapons, CP) it was agnostic to what was being traded on the site.
It sounds like all Faiella was doing was selling bitcoins. Which is not illegal! He happened to be using the SR platform, which also hosted many drug listings, but there should not be guilt by association.
Besides, there was a perfectly legitimate reason for there being a demand for buying bitcoins through such a system as SR, not exclusively limited in any way to helping facilitate drug transactions on the site. I'm guessing some customers buying bitcoin probably just desired the enhanced anonymity afforded through buying bitcoin with this method. Lots of bitcoiners are pretty paranoid about anyone knowing they hold bitcoins, so methods of buying anonymously are a definite plus. And there's nothing wrong or criminal about that.
And was Faiella really 'laundering money', as in trying to clean or legitimize the proceeds of crime? It doesn't sound like it. He was just trying to turn a profit I think (because he bought bitcoins using BitInstant and then sold them with a markup on SR).
If Faiella was trying to launder the proceeds of selling drugs for bitcoin on SR back into USD, wouldn't he be selling *his own* bitcoins rather than ones he bought from Shrem? 
The criminal complaint claims that Faiella's bitcoin selling service on SR "promote[d] narcotics trafficking", but by that logic, so would any business or individual that allowed people to purchase bitcoins. Because they *could* in principle be used for drug transactions.
So I could see potentially how the two defendants violated AML+KYC reporting requirements, and MSB registration statutes (if such statutes really applied to Faiella -- I'm not convinced they do). But the money laundering charges seem to rely on the weak premise that it was all about drugs, which is at best circumstantial evidence. I think that shit should be tossed the fuck out.

So you're using one sentence to reconstruct my whole worldview now? Although that's amazing and I'd love to hear how you do that, perhaps I can agree with you that that's neither here nor there. But I'll remind you that you're the one who started attacking some ideological strawman, and started making empty normative claims rather than make any substantive contentions to my statement.
So let's return to my statement.
I say steal because what happened was not serving justice in any way, shape, or form.
There was no due process, as you suggest. Certainly not in the sense of the term that is conveyed by centuries of Western legal precedence, at least.
Here's a quick rundown:'
- Two judges (one for each bank account - Viridian and Wells Fargo) agreed that there was *probable cause* that Mt Gox had violated 18 USC 1960 - the federal statute requiring MSB registration.
- It should be noted that 18 USC 1960 is a 'special' law that was enhanced under the Patriot Act. There is no *mens rea* requirement in the law, meaning you can be in violation of it without intent.
- 18 USC 1960 also triggers the application of civil forfeiture laws. Assets can be forfeited without any due process. All that's needed is probable cause. That's how the bank accounts were seized.
- Civil asset forfeiture laws are a perversion of justice where property can be convicted of a crime and presumed guilty until proven innocent. The barriers for actually recovering this property are intentionally quite high, with no certainty of timely, if any, return of the seized assets.
To me, this is not justice. It is government agents exploiting powerful laws meant to go after terrorists in order to make money grabs. It is policing for profit. It can reasonably be considered theft. Legalized theft perhaps, but theft nonetheless.
And I think the average person in the US doesn't understand how all of this works, so public opinion doesn't paint a full picture. Believe me, I would like everyone to be informed about how this stuff works, so that people can come to an informed decision about whether they believe it's in the public interest for this kind of government behavior to continue.
Finally, if the government's actions 8 months ago have caused lasting damage to Mt Gox's financial situation, and exacerbated their current situation, then I think the community does have an interest in that, yes. It's not irrelevant as you seem to think.
So, really, it's me who's sorry that you're so concerned with your orthodox version of ideological purity that you can't tolerate someone talking about stuff that is relevant to the current situation with Gox. 
Perhaps if you apply yourself, and love this community enough, you can become a moderator and censor my, and other posts which question the actions of the beneficent government. We certainly wouldn't want people to suspect there are antiauthoritarian people involved in bitcoin now. That would just be too damaging. A currency could never take off with such rabble involved!

Sure, theoretically... but the two different paradigms (mining versus folding) will make use of different computing regimens, and thus will be geared towards different types of hardware. The mining is SHA256, so it will likely be dominated by ASIC. However, the folding is ASIC-resistant, and will be dominated by CPU/GPU.

Look, friend, I'm just calling it like I see it. To me it seems a lot like theft. I've laid out some salient facts and explanations on why I think so. But I didn't really intend to get into a semantic discussion. So if you prefer, suffice it to say that I think what happened was wrong. Gox was victimized by the government. And I emphasize that it could have had a tangible, negative effect on their future customers.
By the way, I'm not alone in my thinking here. There are plenty of legal scholars who dispute the satisfaction of due process by civil forfeiture statutes. So the claim that due process is satisfied here is far from a resolved issue I'd say.
Mens rea is not an irrelevant concept, but rather a longstanding tradition in Western law, and it exists for a reason. I shouldn't have to explain that to you. Liability doesn't apply in this case. No harms resulted from Mt Gox's alleged contravention of the MSB statute.
Apologies on not adhering to your terms of debate, where I can't introduce any new arguments after my first post on the thread. If I didn't follow your format, I suppose you're not obligated to actually address my point there. 
And I'm sorry if you feel I've caused harm to you and a bunch of people you claim to speak for through my comments. Wait, who's playing the victim again?

That did cross my mind, but I don't know. They shouldn't necessarily be connected to one another thru the P2P network, since peer discovery is pretty stochastic I think. But it's possible that the servers communicate to eachother using a different protocol. Like a gap junction rather than a synapse, to make a cell biology analogy. 
Probably the best way is just to test it out! Make sure to construct Txn  in such a way that no miner should confirm it (large size in kb if possible, zero fee, output(s) of less than .01btc). Otherwise, there's probably not much chance of winning against Txn

To be frank, even if it weren't for the stem cell federal funding ban under GWB, I really don't think we would have had a cure for ALS by now. It's still not a very well understood disease, and stem cells are not a magical panacea. There's a great deal more work to be done.
Although the federal funding ban was disruptive to a lot of ongoing research in the US, it wasn't as bad as it could have been (the research was not banned outright). In fact, performing such research was still possible in other countries, and in the US too provided funding means other than federal grants were used (private philanthropy, private research organization, state grants, etc.). 
For example, the State of California helped to ensure a lot of funding continuity for stem cell researchers. This did lead to a bureaucratic clusterfuck where researchers that received funding from both federal and other sources had to clearly demarcate (using stickers) which equipment was paid for with what money -- to ensure no federally-paid-for equipment was being used for stem cell lines that did not have a federal exception. So it was a headache, and a setback. But it could've been way worse.
And although I don't share the same moral concerns as the lobbying bloc that pushed for the federal stem cell funding ban, I can totally identify with them. Their tax money was being used for something they believed was morally reprehensible, and they exerted their political voice to stop it. Of course, this sort of blanket ban wasn't really fair to all the taxpayers who were *for* federal support of stem cell research. But I guess that's democracy for you! Now if only this supposedly "pro-life" bloc had lobbied the federal government to stop blowing up brown kids in other countries... But I guess that's harder to do since so many war profiteers make money off of that.

I don't think it works like you think it works. It's not like the verdict must be 100% guilty of all charges or 100% innocent of all charges. Each charge will be considered separately.

Yeah, I guess I can see why one could perceive it as an inconsistency, I just don't see it that way.
It's easy for me to understand why people got mad at LMG and her publishers. In many peoples' opinion (myself included) they acted irresponsibly as journalists and did not do enough to safeguard the privacy of DSN, a.k.a. Fauxtoshi. Made all the worse by the fact that they appear to have gotten the wrong guy. So that whole debacle was indeed intruding on his private life. We agree on that I think.
Now, this damage has been done. People know his name, his home address, his photo, life details, and lots of details about his family. I simply fail to understand how simplistic memes circulating in a community (which is already privy to all of this info on DSN) is exacerbating the intrusion on his private life any further. The damage has already been done. 
Putting his likeness on memes is pretty tame, in my opinion. We're just avin' a laugh! Oh no, don't call the fun police! But once again, I don't really see the harm that results from this. So it's not inconsistent or hypocritical in my mind to denounce something from which harm resulted (LMG doxing him) while remaining aloof to something from which no demonstrable harm results (meme propagation).
With all due respect, if you can't articulate the harm that the memes cause to DSN then I do believe you have no standing in soliciting this case to this here karmacourt.

Ah, great, thanks for the link. Looks like quite a bit of information to digest; I will try to grapple with it as time permits.
As proof-of-work goes, I wasn't so much talking about it from the bitcoin perspective, but more how it is implemented in the encrypted P2P messaging system [bitmessage]( as an anti-spam measure. This isn't a new idea by the way (using proof-of-work as anti-spam check). I think it dates back to '96 at least.
You can read more about the implementation [here]( and [here]( Basically it serves to ensure that people using the bitmessage network are prevented from a facile way of spamming the network and clogging up the tubes. From a user experience perspective, all it does is take about 10 seconds before your message is sent. So, not all that burdensome to the user.

I'm not anti-vaccination. Neither is Rand Paul for that matter. 
The CDC didn't refute the studies that linked the European flu vaccine preparation to narcolepsy. They just analysed data from patient outcomes after similar vaccines and found no increased risk of narcolepsy. The picture that emerges is that in a very rare instance, a specific preparation of flu vaccine in Europe did trigger narcolepsy in a small subset of patients (some have plausibly speculated that it was through an autoimmune reaction). But this sort of thing happening, although possible, is rare. 
Really I think this is all much ado about nothing. Like most medicines, vaccines are not 100% safe. Rarely they can indeed have serious side effects, including neurological ones. Admitting that vaccines aren't 100 percent safe is not an anti-vaccine stance. Vaccines are a hugely important cornerstone of modern health. That doesn't mean that their use shouldn't be subject to precaution (weighing possible risks and benefits) or the informed consent of the patient or their guardian. 
It seems like, in an effort to not give their opponents any ground, the "pro-science"  crowd is now engaging in denialism over the established fact that vaccines can rarely have grave side effects. That is actually not an informed scientific or medical perspective and I think it undermines the legitimacy of its proponents unfortunately.

Russia calling a do over is not really what I was suggesting. The Russian premier unilaterally signing Crimea over to Ukraine was bad I think. And the Russian government unilaterally saying Crimea is part of Russia again isn't any better.
 What is important is for the will of the Crimean population to be well represented. There's definitely a lot of sentiment of people there that are pro Russian and they wish to be a Russian protectorate, especially after the putsch in Kiev. It's hard to say whether or not the Crimea referendum was a good reflection of that sentiment though. Seems voter turnout was low and it's harder to gauge the legitimacy of the referendum as there was a dearth of international observers since western countries declined to send any. Some countries did send observers though, Serbia for example. Still, even a fair democratic referendum is going to drown out minority voices and undermine their will so that's a problem. I suppose that's just a general critique of democracy though. 
You raise a good point too about the original ethnic population of Crimea and the historical conquests there. I don't think there's a good answer to that. The same thing can be said of many territories where the original population has been displaced. It's a difficult situation with no easy solution.

In the same way that not everyone who takes out cash at a music festival ATM will go on to spend the cash there, you would not expect everyone who bought bitcoin through him to spend it on the SR site. A user could just as easily withdraw to a personal wallet after buying. Not to mention, SR had both licit and illicit items for sale, although if you picked something at random, chances are high it would be contraband. Much like a music festival.

So, if a federal judge decided that there was a 'preponderance of evidence' that Coinbase was not operating with a proper state license, then their assets are subject to civil forfeiture:

Let me preface by saying I'm still skeptical that MK had anything to do with SR... But it's at least plausible and it seems clear the defense is trying to establish this, so maybe there is something to it. And perhaps they even have some cards they haven't turned over yet that would make this scenario look even more plausible.
Anyway -- Previously some people were speculating that MK may have tipped the feds off about RU, just in order to get immunity from prosecution on MSB crimes and/or perhaps even to take the heat off of himself as the alleged DPR.
That would certainly fit with what Dratel's cross-ex has so far revealed: that Karpeles was the primary suspect for years, by multiple different DHS task forces, until they all suddenly congealed around RU as the perpetrator a little after they leaned on MK with the asset seizure and then got his lawyers to start talking.
However, according to the [prosecution's letter to the judge regarding the Rule 807 Testimony]( although MK's lawyers offered for MK to meet with the Baltimore Office DHS US Attorneys in Guam and give the name of DPR in return for favorable treatment (with regards to the 18 USC 1960 money service business law / US bank account asset seizure stuff), this meeting never occurred:


Which would seem not to support the theory that MK tipped off the feds about RU, or tried to scapegoat him, or otherwise snitched in exchange for immunity.
BUT THEN... further on in the document it states:


So it seems that although there was no Guam meeting, MK (through his Mt Gox staff or lawyers) did indeed *send* information to the Baltimore office -- prior to RU's arrest -- about a Mt Gox account that could be traced back to RU. 
Moreover, [Exhibit E in the letter to the judge - an email from MtGox regarding the suspicious account]( references a meeting in Baltimore with feds:


Which means some sort of deal having took place between the Baltimore Office feds and MK is not wholly precluded. 
Although there was a seizure warrant against Gox subsidiary Mutum Sigillum's US dollar assets (~5.5m I think) based on contravention of 18 USC 1960 and other statutes, AFAIK criminal charges have not been brought against MK for 18 USC 1960 violations (although this statute does carry fines and up to 5 years imprisonment, in addition to triggering asset seizure). 
So one explanation for no criminal charges against MK is that there was a deal struck. Another explanation I suppose could be that there is a corporate veil protecting MK here. Or simply that the case is seen as difficult to prosecute (Asset seizures are a much lower evidentiary standard than criminal convictions). I doubt extradition would be an issue though, Japan and US have a [bilateral treaty]( which includes "46. An offense against the laws relating to the control of exportation and importation or international transfer of funds" and "47. Attempt, conspiracy, assistance, solicitation, preparation for, or participation in, the commission of any of the above mentioned offenses "
Now, **IF** MK was the primary DPR, as well as running Mt Gox, that would have given him enormous leverage over both the bitcoin market, and over the finances and financial records of a large percentage of people conducting bitcoin commerce at the time (since Mt Gox was basically the only BTC exchange during SR1's tenure). Mt Gox would have been the premier clearinghouse for tying real world identifiers (National ID documents, emails, login IP addresses) to bitcoin addresses. So **IF** MK was the primary DPR, who bought SR from Ross anonymously, he may have had a huge information asymmetry compared to the seller, and had a trivial time figuring out Ross's identity which he then held onto as a trump card in case of attention from the feds.
Even if MK had nothing to do with SR in reality, this doesn't preclude that he made some sort of deal with the feds in order to get the MSB criminal charges dropped. MK could have leveraged his position as an information broker of tying bitcoin addresses to identities/aliases to gain favorable treatment.
It's also possible that the feds still suspect Karpeles and that a secret precondition of his immunity was also freezing Mt Gox's bitcoin assets while Ross's case is ongoing. This would explain the missing Gox coins and makes more sense than that amount getting lost due to transaction malleability. I think some people on this sub have advanced the suspicion before that Mark is under a gag order and the coins are really under the control of the feds as part of their ongoing Silk Road investigation. 
In support of this, the feds did [justify their seizure of Gox's bank accounts]( in part by saying they were moving  finances into the Silk Road, and that the seizure was actually a part of the ongoing SR investigation!
But, this is all pure conjecture and I'm not sure I really believe anything I just wrote, just fun to speculate about.

[18 USC 1960]( as it stands after being [amended by the USAPATRIOT Act]( stipulates that:
- Operating an unlicensed money transmitting business in any state where that is a crime, is *also* a federal felony crime under 18 USC 1960
- The defendant is not required to have *willfully* or *knowingly* violated the money transmitting licensing laws of the jurisdiction in order to be guilty
- If a federal judge decides that the 'preponderance of evidence' indicates you have violated 18 USC 1960, then your assets are subject to civil forfeiture, *without a trial*
- You could *also* face criminal penalties and jail time

I'm not convinced they are insolvent. I think that is a Fuddish thing to proclaim at this point. (Hope I don't have to eat my hat here).
The unaddressed malleability issue could have potentially resulted in loss of coins, certainly. But really this would only affect their hot wallet. If the attack was persistent enough to burn through their hot wallet faster than expected, then perhaps something stuck out as amiss, and they suspended bitcoin out for the time being while they finally fix this thing.
But Karpeles has made statements to the effect that they do have cold wallets. How would the attackers be able to get these too? They should be safe. I just don't buy that attackers could sap them of all their coin assets before they noticed something was wrong. 
However, in light of the possible attack, it probably would be judicious of Mt Gox to sign some messages with keys to their cold wallets to prove that they have enough coins in reserve.

I suppose I would agree with you when it comes to speculation in certain commodities-- a valuable service comes out of this, in that speculators can enable liquidity and thus facilitate the efficiency of the marketplace. 
But what about the demonstrable harms of speculation-- especially when the speculation is in risky and complex financial derivatives (e.g. toxic derivatives that lead to financial crises and bailouts), or in certain commodities that have a huge impact on human lives? Doesn't the issue get a bit murkier here? For instance, speculation in food derivatives has been [tied to an increase in food prices]( that leads to famine and starvation in poor countries.

Okay, I can see where you're coming from, and I think your argument is well-intentioned, I'm just not sure I can follow you to the point of trying to tell people what to do with their bitcoin income.
For one thing, I don't think there's any reason to be sanctimonious about everyone paying their taxes. There's obviously good arguments on either side for whether or not to pay taxes. Some people will simply dodge taxes out of greed-- that's tough to justify. However, some people approach it from the framework of their own moral reasoning. One must recognize that not everyone sees paying taxes as the moral action to take. Some people consider it outright amoral to pay taxes, because it helps fund, in large part, the wholesale murder of people in foreign lands. 
From [Wikipedia](


So I agree with you that people should be informed about how to use bitcoins and still keep themselves in compliance with tax codes. We don't want people to be taken by surprise. So yes, by all means, spread  the information. Get the resources out there.
I would, however, stop short of trying to tell people what to do. By all means inform them, but then let them make up their own minds on what they choose to do with respect to tax liability. 
And I don't think I buy the argument that tax evasion in the bitcoin economy will spell doom for its reputation. Just look at the US dollar. This week it was revealed that HSBC laundered millions of USD for Mexican drug cartels. I think most of the anger was aimed squarely at the people and the firm responsible, not at the currency in which these transactions were denominated. People hide US dollars (and other fiat currencies) all over the world as a means of tax evasion. A similar situation in the BTC economy wouldn't undermine bitcoin's reputation any more than the US dollar has its reputation sullied by this sort of activity.

If you look up these characters on my [favourite online CH&lt;&gt;ENG dictionary]( you can actually press the green audio icon, and hear a native speaker pronounce the syllables. Keep in mind that the correct pronunciation also involves using the correct tonalities when pronouncing the syllables (the tonalities are commonly represented by accent marks over the vowels of pinyin syllables).

Excuse my pedantry, but they really slaughtered the pronunciation of Zhou Tong's name.
For anyone who's interested, "*Zhou*" is not pronounced like 'zoo'. The real pronunciation sounds more like "Joe", but with a somewhat softer J sound.
The vowel sound in "*Tong*" is not quite a short O sound (like in 'hot') and not quite a long O sound (like in 'tone'), but somewhere in between.
The best way i can think of to write it out phonetically would be "Joe Toang"
The romanization of Chinese words is most commonly carried out using a system called pinyin. The above spelling of "Zhou Tong" is an example of a pinyin transliteration. Correct pronunciations of pinyin words aren't always very phonetically obvious (because the letters are more like stand-ins for different phonemes), so you kind of just have to learn the pinyin pronunciation rules (it's not too difficult to teach yourself though!).

Yeah, agreed. I think the financialization of the American economy can't really be good in the long term... I think that yes, the banking/financial industry is good and necessary (to an extent) in order to maintain a well-greased marketplace, and it is an important service, but compared to other sectors they don't actually create any new wealth or contribute much past a certain point, and it is just kind of parasitism.

There was an [interesting post]( on Jon Matonis's blog about this (not written by him). It makes the case that it's pretty silly for a BitCoin business to register with FinCEN... like isn't the point of BitCoin to have a system that is completely orthogonal to the current monetary system? Anyway, the article doesn't mention BitInstant by name, but I assume that's who they're talking about.

I wasn't suggesting that bitcoin commerce isn't legally taxable (hell, even bartering is supposedly taxable in the US), just that bitcoin doesn't especially lend itself to tax collection.
Tell me, if someone pays me for consulting work under-the-table in bitcoin, and I transfer it to a brainwallet, how does the IRS even know these assets exist? Assuming their existence was known, how does the IRS take possession of it? I suppose they could repo my shit or lock me in a cage, but they still couldn't touch my stash.

Bitcoin is a decentralized, open source currency, it's not *"about"* anything. That's for each individual user to decide, and people will use it how they may. Some users, not all, will likely choose to use it to evade taxes in their respective jurisdictions.
Of course it is incumbent upon the user to be in compliance with their local tax codes, if their aim is to follow the law. I've probably been downvoted because lots of people are uneasy about bitcoin being too closely associated with criminality (drug trade, tax evasion). But I was merely pointing out that bitcoin doesn't exactly lend itself to tax collecting.

As I understand it, anonymous cash deposits of under $10,000 are acceptable (this doesn't trigger AML regulations requiring bank reporting).
Which means that if you actually are trying to launder money into an account, you could just break it up into a lot of smaller transactions by multiple people. Essentially, smurfing it out. 
But I think if you do this, it could still raise suspicions and you might be in violation of another AML statute known as "structuring" where you intentionally are breaking up large transactions to evade federal bank reporting.
Pretty sure this is all in the [Bank Secrecy Act](

Thanks for sharing your perspective. You raised some interesting points. I'll have to chew on this for a while. 
W.r.t. the complex derivative issue I guess I meant that bundling and chopping of financial instruments to make derivatives can obscure their true value and lead to scheisty manouevres (like with the 2008 crisis). What regulations could've prevented this in your mind? Having glass steagall still in place to not encourage risky behaviours and expose taxpayers to the huge losses?
And yes I am definitely following bitcoin. I was astounded to learn the other day that there are mad opportunities for arbitrage between the exchanges. I guess this is a sign of not enough liquidity. Do you engage in BTC trading or botcoinica or anything?

Unfortunately they recommend to people to use Dwolla to purchase BTC... which is pretty  slow due to the requisite Dwolla "account verification" steps for transferring $ to a BTC exchange site, as well as the sluggish ACH transfer itself.
Fastest way I came upon was cash bank deposit to Bitfloor. Roman always credited accounts super fast in my experience. I really liked Bitfloor, too bad it got hacked :(
I guess Bitinstant still does cash bank deposits though (although iirc their fees are higher and it took a tiny bit longer).

The original code apparently was not written in the most beautiful fashion either. And the choice of C++ has been questioned, whether it was the best choice that an elite coder would make. There was some strange kludge in the original code too, like [a poker game lobby]( (?).
But on the other hand, the choice of cryptographic algorithms made has proven to be very prescient. 
Whoever Satoshi was, they were probably not veteran coders. But they probably did have a background in applied cryptography.

The sphere of influence around ourselves best governed by us is influenced by our competence, and by the multiplied competence and proximity of others. The less competent we are, the less efficient it is for us to govern matters farther and farther removed from our personal affairs as they stray into the domain of either the proximity or competence of another person or organization.
Well put. I found these remarks to be quite sapient. I also think there are very many cases where it's clear that more autonomy, self-determination, and distributed sovereignty will be preferable to, and outperform, a top-down, one-size-fits-all type of system.
A lot of people who would call themselves 'libertarians' and/or 'minarchists' would also advocate these ideals, I think. The goal of weakening federal government in favour of local and/or state governments (but not abolishing government altogether) is quite consistent with these political traditions.

If the defense had been able to relate all this at trial I think they could have more convincingly developed their theory that much of the computer evidence was planted.

They got in trouble with the FDA because they were doing genotyping on people by sending kits in the mail you spit into and send back, and then they had a website module where people could interact with their data and learn about the traits or diseases that have been statistically associated with their SNP alleles.


After the FDA brought down the hammer on them, it didn't change much. You can still get a test kit in the mail from them, and you can still interact with their other website modules, like learning about haplotype and ancestry and percentage neanderthal DNA. 
They just shut down the portion of their website that tells you about disease associations since this was the part the FDA took exception to.
The loophole is that you can download you raw SNP data from 23andme and use one of these third party websites or softwares to do the same analysis.

Not really trying to defend them, cause the FDA are crooks, but I think their argument was basically that because it was a type of diagnostic that people could make health care choices from, then it had to be an FDA approved test. I.e., it fell under their jurisdiction as a thing they are tasked with regulating.
It's all kind of a moot point though, because almost instantaneously, people started coming up with ways to analyze the data with other tools, not the 23andMe site. Almost all of the analysis 23andMe does on the SNP genotypes is right from the scientific literature, so it's not like there's not access to their trait/disease association methodology without the company doing it.

The principle of fungibility of money is well rooted in law for centuries, hearkening back to [Crawfurd v. Royal Bank]( Although if there were some kind of scheme to exclude 'tainted' BTC, that would undermine fungibility.
Monero should be perfectly fungible despite the possibility of its tokens being used for nefarious or unlawful pursuits. That's because transaction senders and recipients are masked by ring signatures. So there's no way to know which tokens are 'tainted' and which are not.
If swapping bitcoin to Monero and back to bitcoin became commonplace, enabled by such tools as decentralized exchanges and atomic swap wallets, then that severs the traceability of bitcoin transactions and confers the higher fungibility of Monero back onto bitcoin itself, since there's even less reason to believe that someone could have purposely ended up with 'tainted' coins instead of acquiring them in good faith.
The fact that someone could unknowingly acquire a 'tainted' token is the basis for current legal underpinnings of fungibility of money.

Haha yeah. I mean it's unlikely that you will get a loan from an Islamic bank for opening a pork abattoir, or a gin distillery. 
I didn't want to suggest that Islamic banking is the only alternative to traditional credit extension in the West (with interest, a.k.a. usury). I just wanted to illustrate that there's a whole constellation of different credit extension mechanisms, and Islamic banking was a good example that came to mind.
But in principle, anyone could set up a no usury bank, that is not beholden to the other tenets of Sharia law. 
Or, P2P lending could be another alternative that might be implemented without interest. If credit is extended by lots of people loaning small amounts, rather than a few people loaning huge amounts, then both the possible damage to creditors inflicted by default, and the possible gains to creditors accrued by interest are rather small -- which could obviate a strong need for interest. Currently the requirement for charging interest in microcredit systems has [more to do with transaction fees than anything else]( and this is something that could quite possibly be remedied by bitcoin.

I just meant that the Feds have been known to time things for the auspicious '5th of November' before. The day of the Gunpowder Plot. But also a date which has taken on some significance in the hacker/'cybercrime' culture (mostly because of Anonymous). Anonymous has in the past used this date to do actions or make releases.
So I guess the Feds timing their actions for November 5th (actions relating to 'cybercrime') is kind of a way of signaling their view that they are engaging in a reprisal as a part of a longer campaign.

This right here. It looks like a conflict of interest to me. Reposting some old research I did into Forrest and Schumer.
Judge Katherine Forrest [was recommended by Senator Charles Schumer]( for nomination to the Federal District Court of Southern New York. This was January 2011.
[Obama then nominated her]( based on Schumer's recommendation. This happened in May 2011.
Schumer again went to bat for her during her confirmation hearing in the summer of 2011. This is his [statement]( in support of her confirmation:


accomplished lawyer whose practice has been particularly well-
suited to the needs of litigants in the Southern District. Born 
in New York City, she received her B.A. from Wesleyan, a law 
degree from New York University Law School, spent the majority 
of her career in private practice at the prestigious top-line 
firm, filled with very intelligent, all-around nice guys and 
gals, of Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, where she was on the National 
A List of Practitioners.

Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, where I know 
she is very well-regarded and has served with great 
distinction. I look forward to Ms. Forrest's transition from 
one position of service to our country to the next, and thank 
both of these nominees for putting themselves forward to join 
the Southern District of New York, the bench there.
In this same hearing, Forrest admits that she does not have a firm grasp of technology:

work, and specifically, how do you keep up with technology to 
keep copyrighted works protected?

I was early on in my career as a partner which had one kind of

be tutored by individuals who were knowledgeable in that**. Those

confirmed as a District Court judge I would intend to bring 
that digital experience to the bench, and also to keep abreast 
of the technologies as they continue to develop. No doubt they 
will; it's a very changing, fast-paced environment.
and admits she has meager experience with criminal law:

learned. That is always the case when you are entering into new 
areas of the law. My work ethic is such that I have no doubt 
that I will be able to acquire the skills necessary to be able

Now here's the really interesting part. Just days before Forrest's confirmation hearing, Chuck Schumer [very publicly called for Silk Road to be shut down](
Fast forward to October 2013, Ross Ulbricht is arrested and charged with being the Dread Pirate Roberts. And whose courtroom does this case end up in? Katherine Forrest's, naturally.
One would think that it might present a huge conflict of interest, having a judge preside over a case in which a powerful US Senator, who is *this very same judge's political patron*, vocally and publicly called for federal agencies to go after the Silk Road. 
And this is to say nothing of Forrest's own insufficient qualifications for presiding over such a case, which she admitted to in her confirmation hearing.
I believe Ross Ulbricht got railroaded by a political machine. I was not surprised in the least to hear that Forrest gave him the maximum sentence available. But I do consider it a miscarriage of justice.

The tax evasion thing still could be real by the way. People were saying that the documents were debunked as forgeries due to having layers in Photoshop, but that is a specious argument (same argument birthers were using to call Obama's birth certificate a fake).

There was also an auditor with tax haven experience who reviewed the documents and came to the conclusion that they could indeed be real and are worth pursuing:

Reminds me of this website: 
I tried to do a quick estimate once of how small you could compress the information of one human genome (assuming you could use a reference genome) in order to chop it up and embed it in the blockchain.
3 billion bases in a human haploid genome. But humans are diploid (one copy of each chromosome from dad, one from mom). So that means 6 billion bases total if all the 46 chromosomes are laid end to end.
For a given position on the genome, you need 2 bits to represent a base (since there are 4 bases). For example: 00=adenine, 01=cytosine, 10=guanine, 11=thymine.
However, humans are 99.9% genetically similar to one another. So, if we choose one genome sequence as the 'reference genome' to which all others are compared, we can significantly compress the data needed.
That means there are 6 million discrepancies, on average, to the reference genome. If each base is represented by 2 bits, that means we get it down to 1.5 MB!
But wait, we're not out of the woods yet. Because we actually need to encode, somehow, where these discrepancies (a.k.a. polymorphisms) lie in the genome.
I don't know much about data compression, but it seems to me the best strategy for referencing locational info is just to encode the 'gap size' between each polymorphism. So the data structure would alternate predictably between [2 bits encoding base] and [? bits encoding gap].
Now to make a good data structure with minimal information needed, we ought to know the distribution of distances between polymorphisms. [I found one here]( Due to clustering of polymorphisms (hotspots for genetic variation in the genome) the typical distance is actually less than one would expect simply by dividing the total bases (6 billion) by the number of discrepancies (6 million).
It looks like from that graph we have:
    25% within 1-25 bases
    13% within 26-50 bases
    10% within 51-75 bases
    8% within 76-100 bases
    6% within 101-125 bases
    5% within 126-150 bases
    4% within 151-175 bases
    3% within 176-200 bases
    2% within 201-225 bases
    2% within 226-250 bases
    2% within 251-275 bases
    1% within 276-300 bases
    ∴ 19% &gt;301 bases
To save bits, we can bin gaps into different size categories, and can reserve the first two bits of each gap code to specify which one. For example: 00 = 5 bit number (1 to 32 base gap) which covers ~33% of gaps (I'm estimating), 01 = 8 bit number (33 to 288 base gap) which covers an additional ~50% of gaps, 10 = 10 bit number (289 to 1312 base gap) which covers maybe another ~11% of gaps, and then 11 = 20 bit number (for up to about a million base gap) which ought to cover the remaining 6% of gaps. We would reserve two of these 20 bit numbers to represent indel type polymorphisms (insertions/deletions), which would set off the inclusion of additional data to specify the details needed for the 'compiler' to recapitulate these polymorphisms when looking at the reference genome (For simplicity I'll neglect indel data structures in my estimate below).
So with this rough compression scheme, and according to my assumptions, we have:
    6 million polymorphisms * (2 bits) = 12 million bits
Then for our different gaps:
    6 million gaps * (0.33) * (7 bits) = 14 million bits
    6 million gaps * (0.50) * (10 bits) = 30 million bits
    6 million gaps * (.11) * (12 bits) = 8 million bits
    6 million gaps * (.06) * (22 bits) = 8 million bits
Total is 72 million bits, or 9 MB.
I'm sure there are better compression tricks or optimizations that could make it even smaller though.

Nope money is skimmed off the top.
Member banks who capitalize the Fed are given an annual 6% dividend. This comes out of Fed earnings which are mainly accrued from interest on the national debt. After paying its own expenses and the dividend to member banks, then the remainder is handed to the Treasury.
EDIT: forgot to mention that banks also get free money from the Fed in the form of interest on excess reserves rate (IOER), meaning that banks earn interest on deposits at the Fed that exceed their reserve requirements. The amount of money in excess reserves has grown hugely in the Quantitative Easing era, and iirc the IOER has gone up as well to disincentivize that the extra money that was created by QE will flood into the economy and cause inflation. The money the Fed pays to satisfy IOER obligations also decreases the amount that they eventually hand over to the US Treasury.

IIRC there was (and I guess still is) a way that you could check, for a given email, whether there was an associated coinbase acct. I think it had to do with being able to send bitcoins to someone's acct using email address as an identifier. So it was kind of leaking info but coinbase insisted this was a feature not a bug. 
So if an enterprising individual had a big dump of email addresses from some other source, they could write a script that constantly queried whether that email was tied to a coinbase acct. If there's a hit, then they go spear phishing.

The defense's alternative narrative still seems farfetched. I guess it's quite possible they only took this tack because the judge refused to allow the evidence most sympathetic to their case though. 
Anyway, I think these new revelations have injected a massive amount of reasonable doubt into the whole proceedings. Especially given that the crooked secret service agent was a *computer forensics expert*, i.e. someone with the skillset to frame someone by planting false evidence on their computer.

Isn't there another solution though? Say I have an unspent output that is present on both chains. I want to spend these coins on one chain, but not the other, in such a way that I am insulated from a replay attack. 
So, I simply insert an intermediate step. On chain A, I spend these coins and send to address X under my control. Simultaneously, I broadcast a transaction sending these coins to address Y (which I control) on chain B. 
The worst that could happen here is that by some chance there is a replay attack, but the coins still end up on addresses I control on both chains. So I lose a transaction fee, and that's it.
But if it works, then I've diverged the coins on each chain in such a way that the replay attack cannot be carried out once I chose to send the coins to an address not under my control.

This language might be too strong, since there was really no due process of law here. All that happened is that two judges agreed that there was Probable Cause that certain monetary assets held by Mt Gox subsidiaries were involved in a federal crime, which allowed the government to seize and take possession of these assets pursuant to civil forfeiture statutes. Mt Gox will have an opportunity to fight this in court and sue for their assets back. While Mt Gox is of course innocent until proven guilty (and it actually looks as if no criminal charges are going to be pursued) the civil asset forfeiture laws flip this doctrine on its head. Under civil asset forfeiture laws, the property deemed to have been involved in a crime is considered guilty until proven innocent. No wonder civil asset forfeiture is such a contentious issue in this country. Actually, I think it ought to be more contentious. Most people have no idea that it goes on.


I'd tend to agree with you, but I'd stop short of making this claim. It's still too early to say. As I explained in my above post, the same US Code statute that Mt Gox was deemed to have Probable Cause in contravening applies to many other businesses, including Dwolla, CoinLab, CampBX, etc. These businesses look like they're possibly attempting to be more compliant than Mt Gox was, but looking at the precedent that the Gox seizures set, I think the same statute (as it applies to registration in state jurisdictions as an MSB) could easily be held up by the government to seize the assets of these businesses as well. Maybe there's no federal war on bitcoin, as you say. But it is now clear that the government holds the turnkeys of a devastating salvo of financial WMDs that could be unleashed at any time and severely cripple bitcoin commerce. I just hope everyone is cognizant of that reality.

Thanks this is a good explanation of their stance. I think it is quite ridiculous though. I really don't buy their argument. If one was trying to tumble their coins, this would not be the way to do it. You have no guarantee that the coins you send Casascius aren't the very same ones he makes into physical coins he sends you. So the link might not be severed. The blockchain still betrays the path of the coins. Add to that, the large fee, and the turnaround time, and it sounds like possibly the worst way to 'launder' coins.
There's no reason to go to such lengths either, when its trivial to mix coins from a computer, like [here]( or [here]( with low fees and pretty instantaneously. And these systems are actually designed to be good mixers, unlike Casascius.

It would be the difference between getting 14 dollars a week or getting two dollars per day.
You'd get the same amount of money over a long enough period of time (contingent upon your hashrate contributed) but as a part of a larger mining pool, you'd get dividends sent back your way more often, since the rate of block discovery would be higher.
Of course that's just my understanding of it. I never mined, I don't really know.

Hmm... that's an interesting claim. I thought it seemed at least plausible since the Y chromosome is 100 MB smaller than the X chromosome. This means that a haploid male genome is only 97% the size of a haploid female genome. Of course, the discrepancy wouldn't be nearly that large when considering the total mass of the sperms, but it might be enough to produce a slight velocity advantage. Given a long enough swim, this might be enough to let the Y sperm pull ahead.
However, I did a quick google search, and apparently it's been debunked.

BTCkan (kan or 看 means 'see' or 'watch' in Mandarin) is a good central place to keep tabs on Chinese exchanges.
They are reporting (as of this post) a 24-hour volume of 99812 on BTC100. That does seem outlandishly high. I assume BTCkan just pulls info off of each exchange website automatically and collates it. So if the underlying number on BTC100 is wrong, then this isn't really substantiating.

They do not have a money transmitter license for the state of California, though, which was my point. In fact, it would take years, giant stacks of paperwork, and up to 7m dollars of bonding in order to obtain one.
Look, *I* don't think they should be classified as a money transmitter. 
And *they* don't think they should be classified as a money transmitter (according to their [TOS]( : "Coinbase is not a money transmitter. Coinbase assists its users in Bitcoin transactions").
And *you* probably don't think so either.
But I'm saying, all that really matters is if some Grand Inquisitor at DHS or ICE thinks up a reason why Coinbase could be deemed a money transmitter under California law. Then they're really over a barrel, and at the mercy of 18 USC § 1960 and the related civil asset forfeiture provisions in 18 USC. § 981(a)(1)(A).
I definitely want to give Coinbase the credit for trying to be compliant. I wasn't disparaging them. Merely pointing out that all their efforts could be in vain given that the government has usurped basically limitless powers in seizing financial assets, and they have a [perverse incentive for doing so as well](
@_date: 2013-05-16 10:47:31
OK I read the warrant in full, and also looked up some additional information. [standard disclaimer IANAL blah blah blah etc. and so forth].
You might be interested to learn that the authority used by the government in the Gox seizures are part of overreaching new powers granted in the PATRIOT Act (new authority for civil asset forfeiture, and striking *mens rea* considerations being foremost).
Futhermore, I would like to point out that the (18 U.S.C. section 1960) MSB registration statutes, although enacted in 1992, only came into effect in 2001. I think we did just fine without these laws in the past. And due to their very recent inception, I regard it as still very much up for debate whether (18 U.S.C. section 1960) is harmful or helpful. 
In regards to that point, I'd like to copy a comment made by sgornick on [Kashmir Hill's recent Forbes article]( pointing out how these statutes fundamentally harm innovation, and serve as a barrier to new competitors in the financial sector while entrenching legacy actors:










(18 U.S.C. section 1960) actually makes it a felony not only to fail to comply with federal MSB registration guidelines, but also state MSB registration guidelines as well. It's a daunting, costly, and lengthy barrier for new players. And although many US-based bitcoin exchanges *have* registered as an MSB at the federal level with FinCEN/US Treasury, I don't believe any US-based bitcoin exchanges are currently registered both federally and in all state jurisdictions. (Correct me if I'm wrong). In fact, if I'm not mistaken, California-based CoinBase (recently touted by many on as an example of a compliant business) is actually named as a defendant in Aaron Greenspan (of FaceCash)'s recent [lawsuit]( Precisely because CoinBase is not registered in the state of California as an MSB. So this means that virtually any bitcoin exchange operating in the US, not just Gox, is potentially subject to seizure and asset forfeiture under (18 U.S.C. section 1960). Isn't that a bit scary?
For more background on this history of (18 U.S.C. section 1960), and the modifications to statute that were part of the PATRIOT Act, I found [this legal bulletin]( to be an excellent primer.
To address your points.


Actually, two accounts were seized and subject to civil forfeiture. One was the Mutum Sigillum Dwolla account associated with Veridian Credit Union of Iowa. The other was the Mutum Sigillum account at Wells Fargo which was seized and forfeited 5 days prior (this order was signed off by a different judge). It's right there in the warrant. [This short article]( explains the two separate bank account seizures pretty succinctly.


This is an interesting point. But oddly, nowhere in the seizure warrant do they make this argument. In fact, the confidential informant in Maryland (CI-1) undertook a completely boomerang-esque transaction regime: CI's Maryland bank account&gt;&gt;CI's Dwolla account&gt;&gt;MtGox(USD)&gt;&gt;MtGox(BTC)&gt;&gt;MtGox(USD)&gt;&gt;CI's Dwolla account&gt;&gt;CI's Maryland bank account


The end? We'll see I guess.

The penny eventually must be retired. It's been inflated into irrelevance. In fact, old copper pennies are now worth more than 0.02 USD because of the inflation of the dollar and the rise in copper prices over time.
There's probably a delay in retiring it because I imagine they want to have something similar to the RCM's Alloy Recovery Program in Canada in place beforehand. This would help to ensure that no one reaps profits off of retiring the penny except the US Treasury. That is to say, they'll keep it illegal for everyone else to melt down copper (pre 1982) pennies for scrap except them, so that penny hoarders don't get rich instead of Treasury.

True. The market depth that I've been seeing on there does not seem to support such a high volume (unless the trades are being created and executed nearly instantly, then we wouldn't see them via such a chart). From what I can understand, BTC100 does not support dark liquidity. But another option is that if a seller was trying to sell off a great deal of coins, without affecting the price downward too much, or tipping their hand, via the market depth stats, to their large holding they intend to sell off, they could automate a bot to sell small amounts incrementally to the highest couple of bids as soon as these bids are created. Then the bot waits until some smaller bids creep up to that price point again. Then again, it could be a glitch! 
Definitely a head-scratcher, this one.

That's one consideration (the counterfeiting), but I don't think that was the primary reason... For example, the EU still prints 500 euro notes (worth 654 USD). The 100 bill is the highest denomination in America, I think, as a way to discourage large value transfers using untraceable cash. 
I agree with other posters in this thread that there's a war on cash domestically, but I don't think it's going to go away entirely ever, as long as the US has currency seigniorage and an empire. If paper US money falls out of use, then how else are we going to airlift [pallets full of 100 dollar bills]( into countries we're occupying, in order to bribe the various factions into stopping killing one another temporarily, so that we can perpetuate the myth that US invasions promote stability?

Go to the SD site. Click "ADVANCED" on the top menu bar. Assuming you made the bet from the standard client, you can open it up and go to the Transaction tab, and then right-click and choose "Show transaction details" for the bet transaction you sent. Copy-paste the Transaction ID into the "By just transaction ID" prompt that's in the ADVANCED window on the SD site, and it will return the results of the bet.

Great stuff. I never fail to learn new things when reading a Vitalik Buterin article!
I think this is a pretty fair assessment he makes about the current state of the art w/ deterministic wallets + brainwallets:


Perhaps the solution could be to tweak the Approach (1) technique in order to add more complexity (i.e. key stretching) and thus guard against bruteforcing attacks (brainwallet rainbow tables, or 'brainbow tables' if you will). How to simply add more complexity to make brainbow table creation untenable, while still maintaining a memorizable method for rederivation? Well, one would choose a strong (but memorizable) password/passphrase, and *then* also choose a memorizable 4-6 digit PIN we'll call 'n'. After hashing the password, the resulting string is iteratively hashed n times to generate the actual seed. I think this would be very simple to script.
EDIT: If iteratively hashing up to a million times isn't enough of a safeguard, operations on/between numbers in the PIN can be performed in order to generate a larger number of hash iterations applied to the password/passphrase, which would still be deterministically generated from the PIN. Alternatively, use a hashing algorithm that takes longer to perform.
EDIT2: Iterative hashing (depending on how many iterations) could take a while. Such a crypto implementation would be impractical for many purposes. But personally I wouldn't mind waiting 10-20 minutes or so in order to make a seed that much safer from brute force. You wouldn't want it to take *too* long though. Because if you lose your hardware with your private keys on it, you will want to be able to regenerate your seed in a somewhat timely fashion as well. One must weigh these two factors: safety against derivation using an attacker's bruteforce attack, and convenience of rederivation for the user.

The FATF also maintains a [blacklist]( for jurisdictions that don't comply with their standards. A sort of... penalization for nation states that don't go along with the global monetary hegemons. This would be the 'stick' portion of the 'stick and carrot' approach that Ms. Shasta Cavalry alluded to in her Banking Subcommittee testimony.
The thing is, the FATF penalties largely rely on restricting access to legacy global banking, wire transfer, and foreign investment infrastructure. The very systems that bitcoin is making redundant and bypassing.
I predict that if bitcoin adoption continues apace in the future, and if FATF attempts to strictly enforce burdensome cryptocurrency standards globally, then the global finance system could start to further balkanize into states that rely largely on the legacy infrastructure of the monetary hegemons, and states that opt to pursue other available opportunities, such as the ones cryptocurrencies provide. In essence, hardline actions by FATF could further spur adoption and reliance on cryptocurrency by states that can't or won't comply.

US transnational corporations operating in Colombia (Coca Cola, Dole, et al.) also benefit from repression and intimidation of Colombian workers/unionists enabled by US aid.

EDIT: 
Sorry, terse admonitions like that don't add much to the discussion. I'll leave my original comment up for posterity. But now that I've got some time to spare, I think I owe it to you all to explain why I hold this opinion.
It seems to me that a lot of people are okay with the seizure because they are (justifiably, I think) angry at Mt Gox for their abysmal service of late, such as their horrendous trading lags. That is essentially the reasoning behind OP's points  and  And furthermore, perhaps many of you view Mt Gox as being somewhat incompetent all around, especially in light of their possible breach of contract with CoinLab. 
Here's the thing, though. Despite your distaste for Gox, that is a terrible reason to take the government's side here. If Mt Gox is incompetent or is providing a poor service, then the market will certainly sort that out on it's own. Their poor service provides plenty of room and plenty of incentive for competitor exchanges to move in and outperform Gox. You don't like Mt Gox? Then don't do business with them! If they're fucking up, competitors will move in and take their market share. In fact this is already in the process of happening. We really don't need the government to step in and 'facilitate' this with their arbitrary regulations and their capricious actions like the recent asset seizure.
 Let's be real here. Seizing bank account assets suddenly and unexpectedly, without warning or notification, and without any real due process, just on account of alleged misfiled paperwork is * completely ridiculous*. Just because it happened to an exchange people don't particularly like right now is besides the point.
The US government is out of control right now, and power mad. It's like a rabid tiger. I know it's tempting to ride that tiger and see it smite your enemies, or whatever. But you can't expect that same tiger to turn into a cuddly pussycat and lick your face afterward. No one should advocate the government wielding this kind of power. If such a thing can happen to Gox for such a nit-picky little reason, then it can happen to anyone really. All they need to do is invent some sort of BS justification. I don't think any of us truly want to live in a world where the government is picking winners and losers in the bitcoin economy. That hasn't typically worked out too well in other sectors in the US (like... telecom industry for example). If we don't speak out and defend businesses from governmental overreaches like this one, regardless of whether we hold this business in high esteem or not, then we are going to end up putting everyone's rights in jeopardy.
For more on whether I think the seizure was justifiable or not, I'm reposting my [comment]( from [this thread]( here:








I hope Mt. Gox won't be bullied. I hope they fight this in the courts, kind of like what Kim Dotcom did after the US Government wronged him.

If you merge mine with the bitcoin network though, don't you sort of piggyback on its existing hashing power (assuming bitcoin miners are willing to mine on both chains)? Since I've never mined, I don't really have a good idea of how much of an added burden it is for a pool operator or a solo miner to configure mergemining on another blockchain. But as far as electricity/hashrate, it should be no different than if one was mining on just one blockchain as opposed to two. So as I understand it, there's sort of nothing to lose.
As for financial incentive... Assuming the proofcoins were used as tokens of some sort in order to effect the actions/features that mentioned (like notarizing timestamped doc hashes into the blockchain), and assuming enough people were using the proofcoin system, then I think the demand for proofcoin tokens and thus a financial incentive for mining would sort of emerge naturally. Even if proofcoins were worth mere pennies on the satoshi, if enough miners thought it was a cool project, maybe they'd voluntarily mergemine onto it. That would give it a nice jumpstart.
I mean, the merged mining thing seems to work pretty well for namecoin. But IIRC namecoin started out as it's own network and then was switched to merged mining later...

This article didn't sit right with me.
Reposting the rebuttal I made on [------
I feel I should chime in here. I've been following bitcoins for a good long while now. I'm no expert, admittedly-- but this article simply seems like a poorly researched hatchet piece to me. I mean... "Real-world environmental disaster" is just unvarnished hyperbole. And I've seen [others]( recently making similar arguments as well. I'm not saying that there *aren't* any valid critiques of bitcoin, but saying it's somehow not environmentally friendly is one of the most ludicrous arguments I've seen against it.
Here's what everyone should know:
**1)** The "mining" done in the bitcoin network is not simply make-work. It actually serves a vital purpose-- and the miners are rewarded for their service with bitcoins. The computational power provided by miners is actually the very thing that keeps the network secure. It serves to verify transactions, prevent counterfeiting and double-spending, and to prevent past transactions in the public ledger from being doctored. The decentralized contributions to network computational power also ensure that no one entity is in control. In fact, bitcoin elegantly solves what was once an outstanding problem in decentralized systems:
[Paul Bohm writes](


**2)** Bitcoin is still a nascent technology, and the bitcoin mining strategies have seen near-constant innovation from bitcoin's inception. First, miners used regular old CPUs to mine. Then, miners started to realize that high-end gaming graphics cards (GPUs) could actually mine more efficiently, so GPU miners started to dominate in their computational power. Next, people started to optimize field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) in order to more efficiently perform the mining algorithms while consuming less power. The current gold standard for bitcoin mining is called the ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). These are custom-built devices tailored for one thing and one-thing only-- bitcoin mining. So how much improvement in mining efficiency have we seen in the 4 years that bitcoin has been around? Well, an ASIC can currently perform roughly 100 megahashes (MH - measure of computing power) each second for every watt of power it consumes. Contrastingly, a good GPU will only get about 1-2 MH/s/W. [(source)]( In only four years, the efficiency of mining hardware has increased 50-100 fold. Not bad. Currently, ASICs contribute about half of the computing power to the network. Soon, bitcoin mining should be even more heavily dominated by efficient ASIC technology.
**3)** Any even-handed discussion of the bitcoin payment network's resource consumption should at least attempt to compare it to more mainstream payment systems. Payment processors like Paypal have servers [(~80,000)]( headquarters, and employees [(~13,000)]( which consumes lots of resources as well. Assuming a draw of 500W per server, Paypal would draw about 960 Megawatt-hours of power per diem for its servers alone (this is comparable to the author's estimate of bitcoin network's power consumption-- 982 MW hours per diem). Credit card companies have an even more enormous infrastructure that consumes a great deal of resources. And both Paypal and credit cards waste an inordinate amount of time on chasing down fraud, phony transactions, and performing chargebacks. In contrast, the architecture of bitcoin uses strong cryptography to prevent phony transactions and obviate chargebacks. And this is to say nothing of the largesse of the banking systems of the world and the amount of resources they consume. In the US, for example, the monetary/banking infrastructure actually consumes a great deal of nonrenewable resources-- copper, nickel, manganese, and zinc for minting coins; cotton, linen, and ink for printing dollar bills; gasoline for transporting coins/bills from the mints and engravers, and also to transport cash in armored vehicles between businesses and/or banks. It's worth pointing out that electricity (the main resource that the bitcoin network consumes) is currently *far* more renewable than metals and gasoline. And bitcoin has the potential to serve as an alternative for not only Paypal and credit cards, but for banking as well. In essence, it allows you to "be your own bank". I think, on the whole, bitcoin is more "green" than people give it credit for.
If you made it this far, thanks for reading. And by the way, if you still think that the energy consumption of bitcoin is a sticking point for you, you might be interested to know that there are alternative cryptocurrencies in development which are being designed to require less computational resources in order to secure the network (i.e. be more energy efficient). The most prominent one that I know of is called "peer-to-peer coin" or PPcoin (a.k.a. PPC). Instead of the "proof-of-work" computational requirement that bitcoin uses, PPC makes use of a different protocol called  "proof-of-stake".

I admit to not reading the article voisine posted (thanks for the TL;DR), but if I'm not mistaken, hasn't [Bitfloor essentially been doing a variation of this]( for a long time now? They provide a 0.1% rebate for transactions that remain on the order book before they execute-- rewarding the liquidity provider and thus incentivizing healthy price discovery. Although, the trading volume on Bitfloor still seems to be rather low, so much so that price discovery doesn't appear to function optimally (bid-ask spread can be pretty large at times).

The fact that these bitcoins seem to have been stored in such a fast-and-loose manner makes me think that it was just one portion of his fortune. The feds' estimate of $80 mil in profits seems highball to me, but then again, $28 mil seems too low to me. 
This is obviously a huge propaganda victory for the FBI that they were able to seize a large amount of coins from (one of?) DPR's wallets. In the press release, they flaunt this seizure to drive home their point that if you break the law, they will catch you and take your possessions. Then again, I think it's unlikely that they have completely dispossessed DPR of his fortune.
Hopefully this whole episode doesn't shake trust in the security of the bitcoin protocol or encryption in general. I don't think it should, because it appears that DPR made mistakes in how he protected his coins. Still, lots of commenters are handwringing about how the FBI has broken encryption. I mean, come on. Is that really the most parsimonious explanation?
If nothing else, this whole episode can be a good learning experience for bitcoin users. Everyone should ask themselves the question: If my computer/external HD/mobile device was stolen by someone who knew I held bitcoins, would they be able to use forensic software to recover my private keys?

Looks like there's some panic selling going on. If you have a BTC-TC account, consider a certain issuer trustworthy, and think the shares will be made transferable to another site, now's a good time to pick up some shares. For instance you could pick up NEO-BEE shares for less than their IPVO pricing of 0.0030. I imagine these shares will be easily transferable to a BitFunder account since the BTC-TC shares are just a passthrough managed by TAT (and the underlying asset is on BitFunder).

Nice!! I first envisioned a bitcoin procurer service like yours 10 months ago, and had a feeling that one would come onto the scene sooner or later. There should certainly be an unmet demand for this type of thing. Should help to energize and grow the bitcoin economy quite a bit hopefully.
Two questions I'm curious about:
- What happens to your bitcoin revenue stream? I imagine you'll have to sell some off in order to pay vendors in fiat. What about the rest? Do you aim to keep a portion of it inside the bitcoin economy, rather than converting to fiat? For instance, are you paying employees in BTC?
- Sounds like you provide customer name and address to the 3rd party vendor and then have them ship direct to customer. But this will compromise some anonymity of the transaction since the 3rd party will likely retain the customer's name and address. Do you plan on offering an alternate option, where you have 3rd party vendors ship the product to you first, and then ship to the customer, so that no customer address data is retained by the 3rd party online vendor? I imagine this would entail additional S&amp;H fees, but it should at least be an option, right?
Anyway, Best of luck getting started!

Saying Coinbase only has a 1% USD&lt;&gt;BTC fee might not tell the whole story. That's because they use a homebrewed algorithm on their site to calculate the buy and sell prices. It pulls in and integrates price data from several different exchanges and spits out the exchange rates they use for buy/sell. Right now the buy and sell prices have a $20 spread. So they're probably making money by setting these prices at reasonable, but favorable-to-their-business levels.

First things first, DPR is not charged with murder. Looks like he can be charged with is under [21 USC § 846]( which is "attempt and conspiracy", in regards to allegedly soliciting a murder-for-hire. A murder, I might add, that appears never to have taken place. 
Two situations seem likely in regards to this. 
1) The extorter "FriendlyChemist" who was threatening DPR that he'd release SR user info unless paid in bitcoins was the same entity "redandwhite" that DPR allegedly contracted with to make the hit, so the whole thing was an elaborate way to extort bitcoins from DPR.
2) Both "redandwhite" and "FriendlyChemist" users were law enforcement who were intentionally trying to goad DPR into contracting a murder-for-hire (to build a case, and to publicly defame him). This theory would explain why communications to and from "FriendlyChemist" and DPR, and to and from "redandwhite" and DPR were known by the FBI. It would also explain why Canadian customs was able to know to seize a package of fake IDs that DPR allegedly ordered from "redandwhite" after the whole murder-for-hire incident.
And yes, in regards to your jury nullification question, you're essentially correct. Even if a juror sees enough evidence to the point that the accused would be guilty of a given crime, they can still exercise their conscience and return an innocent verdict (if they think the crime should not be illegal in the first place). Just one juror firmly exercising their right to do this can have a profound influence on the case, and future jurisprudence as well.
Jury nullification is most commonly used in the case of victimless crimes (such as many drug charges). As you allude to, I don't expect it would be seen for murder or murder-for-hire charges (as most everyone would condemn this sort of thing as wrong). 
However, if jurors are aware of their right to nullify, I think there's a potential he'd be at least found innocent on some of the clearly victimless crimes he's been accused of (facilitating narcotics trade, money laundering).
As for the murder conspiracy charge, I think there's a chance it might not be admissible if his lawyers are savvy. The whole thing reeks of law enforcement engineering and entrapment to me. Plus it's heavily reliant on FBI allegations, as no murder appears to have been committed in relation to the alleged solicitation. It all seems somewhat fishy and unconvincing to this redditor. But then again, prosecutors tend to dismiss duly sceptical people like me during jury selection.
I looked at some more court documents. It appears these are more the relevant statutes for the murder-for-hire allegations:
18:1512(a)(1)(C) ATTEMPTED
WITNESS MURDER; 18:2 AIDING
AND ABETTING
18:1958(a) USE OF INTERSTATE COMMERCE FACILITIES IN COMMISSION OF A MURDER-FOR-HIRE; 18:2 AIDING AND ABETTING

I guess I'm having trouble understanding what BTC100 would have to gain by inflating their volume numbers so high though?
I suppose it could help raise the profile and notoriety of the site, but that's sort of a weird way to go about that.
The only other reason I can think of for an exchange to do such a thing is for manipulating bitcoin exchange rates in the bitcoin economy. If certain bitcoin services are using a volume weighted average of BTC&lt;&gt;CNY exchanges in order to determine the exchange rate used by their site, then a given exchange could lie about their volume in order to push the exchange rate in a given direction. But in practice I think this would be a difficult thing to profit from. Especially because it would raise suspicion and perhaps that exchange would no longer be seen as a trustworthy input into weighted exchange rate calculations.

Every night before bed, Paul Krugman prays for extraterrestrials to attack Earth. The thought of all the government spending and Keynesian economic stimulus that would unleash gives him a raging semi.

Failing public support for that, I think he'd at least settle for continued spending on fending off terrorist phantoms.

Instead of asking whether Coinbase is compliant, I think the better question is to ask: **is the government bound to adhering to its own laws in the first place**?
Different folks might answer this question differently. My answer would be no. And I think the preponderance of evidence backs me up on that.
Does anyone really think, at this point, that it matters all that much what the law says? Let's assume Coinbase is 'compliant' (whatever that means). First of all, I'd argue that it's fundamentally impossible to be 100% compliant because the laws are hopelessly complicated and vague. (Especially the way they're interpreted regarding math-based currencies). Well, push that aside for the moment and let's just say that Coinbase gives it their very utmost. Well, too bad, because if the government wants to seize property, they'll darn well seize it. All they have to do is make up some bullshit justification (having complicated, vague laws assists greatly with this) and then get a judge to sign off on it in secret. Behold, the magic of [civil asset forfeiture]( Thanks, PATRIOT Act! (Obligatory 'yay freedom').
I don't even think that Coinbase *has* done the utmost to ensure 'compliance' though. They're vulnerable, in my eyes. It wouldn't even require that much effort to get that bullshit justification for a seizure warrant.
I'd like to remind everyone that Coinbase is currently named as one of the myriad defendants in Aaron Greenspan's [lawsuit]( which arose out of the regulatory morass he found his FaceCash company in recently. TLDR, he felt that his company was being singled out under the CA MTA law, whereas other entities performing similar services were being allowed to operate without having to jump through the regulatory hurdles of this law. So he's suing those services. We'll see what happens with this lawsuit, but I think it's far from certain that Coinbase is operating legally under the CA MTA law. And any uncertainty can certainly be exploited by overzealous federal agents.
"Oh, but goonsack," you say. "Why mention federal agents, if Coinbase simply isn't complying with California law?". Well, if certain federal government officials capriciously decide that Coinbase is *not* operating legally under CA MTA law, then that opens up a whole can of shit. This is because, under [18 USC § 1960]( it is a *federal* felony to "[operate] without an appropriate money transmitting license in a State where such operation is punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony under State law, **whether or not the defendant knew that the operation was required to be licensed or that the operation was so punishable**". By the way, that part in bold was [added in the PATRIOT Act]( Yay freedom! Another important effect of the PATRIOT Act was to stipulate that contravention of 18 USC § 1960 is now subject to civil asset forfeiture authority under [18 USC. § 981(a)(1)(A)]( This is what happened to those two bank accounts owned by Mt Gox (or more accurately, its subsidiary Mutum Sigilum), by the way.
So, do I personally think Coinbase is liable to get shut down? I don't think it's all that likely, but who knows? Time will tell. I just don't think anyone should be lulled into a false sense of security. Despite how many rich VCs back them, or how many regulators they attempt to buy off, they're still not the biggest kid on the block, by any means. Nothing can really preclude the possibility of the wrath, greed, and venality of our out-of-control government coming down on them like a hammer.

Sure, why would we ever need evidence that a crime has actually been committed yet before we take action to stop it? Prosecuting precrime is much more effective! I'm sure if the government works hard enough, and aggressively enough, they can win the war on money laundering.

Not sure if this statement applies here. Typically this is said in reference to malice and/or stupidity exhibited by the same entity.
However, in this case, it is Mt Gox's stupidity, and the government's malice that we're talking about.
Justifying government malice because of Mt Gox's stupidity is just victim blaming.
Based on what I've read, it sounds like it's possible that Mt Gox (or Mutum to be precise) did make a stupid move by failing to register with FinCen as an MSB. Stupid move, perhaps. But somewhat understandable as well. All anyone really had to go on at this point was vague cryptocurrency MSB guidelines promulgated by FinCEN in the last couple months. In the final analysis though, can all this really justify a sudden and unexpected asset seizure? Just over some unfiled/misfiled paperwork? Assuming Gox *was* in violation, it seems to me that the most parsimonious and agreeable solution would have been for govt agencies to just contact Gox (Mutum) about their noncompliance, and then work with them to rectify it.
Not to mention, registering as an MSB is incredibly burdensome. I thought sgornick's comment on the OP's linked article was quite well put:

This is important. I feel like too many bitcoin services were pegging to the gox rate. This was bad-- in a similar way to the LIBOR rigging scandal-- because it's obvious that the gox rate was susceptible to manipulation. And then this would affect the greater bitcoin economy.

Move to Nevada, buy some land with a single-family dwelling on it. Establish an [allodial title]( I think that's the closest you can get to outright real estate property ownership in the states.
The fee is pretty hefty. One way to think of it is that you're prepaying your future property taxes in the present, which relieves you of paying them in the future.
Still, the Nevada allodial title system is not absolute. The title is only valid for the lifetime(s) of the title holder(s). If the property is to be inherited by a person who was not an allodial titleholder, then the title reverses to a normal title with property tax liability.

This is an excellent point which seems to be absent from eyal0's analysis.
One of the beauties of the bitcoin architecture is that if you're running multiple solo-mining machines, it actually obviates the need to worry about cycling through the same nonces on multiple machines. No kind of special coordination is needed, because, as you point out, due to the different inputs provided by the different block reward addresses, the two machines will actually get a completely different hash from using the same nonce. 
So I just don't understand why you'd ever need to divvy up nonce-space among different machines (unless you were a mining pool coordinator)... seems needlessly laborious otherwise.

I like your approach better. Seems like many try to explain bitcoin mining in terms of 'solving math equations' or somesuch thing... but that tidbit on its own will lose people, because it seems like an extraneous detail without one tying it to the overall big picture.
So yes, it's important to make the link that the computational power invested towards the math problems is actually serving a useful purpose, i.e. verifying transactions, and securing the network from phony transactions and other such fuckery.

Yeah, I think it's overreaching to characterize this as an endorsement on the part of the CCP. Perhaps the censors didn't fully realize the possible political ramifications... or maybe they just didn't think these ramifications would come about.
The fact that this aired on CCTV could be interpreted a lot of different ways... I don't think it tells us much about the CCP's stance on bitcoin just yet.
However I will be curious to see if the CCP will tip their hand in the future and hint at what they make of bitcoin... On the one hand, they are very authoritarian, and seek to preserve power while promoting 'harmonious society'. Disruptive technologies are often suppressed by the state (e.g. Internet censorship, even up to and including measures to prevent usage of VPNs and TOR). On the other hand, the CCP elite are technocrats and pragmatists. Bitcoin must be on their radar. Maybe they figure that if there's a good chance cryptocurrencies could rise to prominence and supplant fiat currencies around the world, they wouldn't want China to miss the boat.

That depends. What wallet client do you use? Most just automate this function. You can use blockchain.info to see what happens after you make a transaction that contains bitcoin 'change'. Most clients send the change to a fresh address that is controlled by your wallet.


Yep. Seems like the best way is to just empty out a cold address completely into a hot wallet, spend what you need, and then send what remains to a fresh cold address (or a preexisting cold address that has not been spent from yet).
 Lastly, I think it's probably not *absolutely imperative* that you take these precautions, but it certainly is best practice. Not very many bitcoins have ever been stolen in this fashion. The ones that were stolen were due to a vulnerability in how Android selected random numbers. However, knowing now that NSA intentionally sabotages PRNGs for devices/OSs and EC parameters for crypto implementations does highlight how this simple precaution should become habit.

This is a great fact to have in one's pocket. A common reaction when people are hearing about bitcoin is for them to ask "*Yeah, but if it's all on computers, then what happens if the internet/power goes out?*". Yes, of course that's a concern, but if that happened, it would happen to ATMs, credit cards, internet banking, etc. as well. In fact, the bitcoin network is more resilient to disruption, because it's global, peer-to-peer, and the ledger is backed up in thousands of different places around the globe. If you're worried about long-term power or telecommunications outages, stockpile some paper bills, or better yet, some gold and silver.

How eBay could "rescue" bitcoin... and make a fuckton of money in the process. If they can leverage their regulatory advantage to make bitcoin buying/selling extremely simple, with minimal hassle, then they'd stand to make a great deal of money down the road.
Kind of sad how the insane amounts of regulation, licensure, and bonding for money transmission basically give the huge behemoth companies that have already jumped through all these hurdles a gigantic leg up. 
Part of me would certainly be happy if eBay/Paypal embraced bitcoin (as it's a sign that the currency is gaining steam), but then again, it's really not fair that eBay gets such a huge advantage. These regulations would be essentially granting them a money transmission dynasty while keeping their competitors in a constant state of precariousness trying to fend off legal challenges, comply with vague guidelines and AML/KYC, and appease regulators. But maybe that's the whole point of such laws.

Then again, the vast majority of people making use of the dwolla&lt;&gt;gox liquidity are using it for entirely legitimate purposes in the eyes of the law. Is it fair to them to shut this conduit down just due to a few rule-breakers? And is it fair to Dwolla, and Mt.Gox, who were complying with AML and KYC laws in good faith? It sounds like the seizure came *completely out of the blue* for Dwolla. If the idea was to try to target money launderers, as you suggest, why didn't the feds try to cooperate with Dwolla or try to encourage them to adopt more stringent AML practices? Why serve them with a court order out of the blue? 
To zoom out even further, [should money laundering even be a crime in the first place?]( Why make money laundering illegal when the crimes this practice abets are *already illegal*? 
And to zoom out further still, should many of the crimes that money laundering abets even be illegal in the first place? I say just end the Drug War right now, that will put a halt to a significant amount of money laundering right then and there. As for terrorism, why not just change US foreign policy so that we don't go out of our way to make people in the Middle East hate us? 
Pursuing money launderers is the wrong way to go about things if you ask me. And you'll never stop it. Especially not with things like bitcoin coming into play. It's as hopeless as the "War on Terrorism". We'd be better off actually addressing the root causes of our problems rather than empowering unaccountable bureaucracies to impede financial freedom, invade privacy, and stifle innovation.

I'm sure this has been asked before, but if Satoshi chose to reveal himself/herself/themselves, what would be the best way to do it? Would they be able to substantiate their identity by proving they controlled the private key to the [address]( where the 50 BTC mined from the genesis block were sent? Is that how they would do it, do you think? Of course, they wouldn't have to reveal their actual name(s) or anything... proving ownership of the private key could just serve as a verification for a public announcement or an AMA or somesuch. Maybe that wouldn't be Satoshi's style though... they've remained pretty silent. Anyone know when the last known communication was from Satoshi (through github or bitcointalk or otherwise) was?
Haha, as an aside, looks like people (and businesses -- CoinLab and Gox) have actually sent bitcoin tips and public notes ("Hello Satoshi", "Thx Satoshi") to the genesis address that presumably must be controlled by Satoshi.

That's a good point I spose.
But it's not always practical to *not* reuse an address. For instance, if I publish an address for tips, or expect to keep getting payments at a certain address. A good example would be the bitcointip bot. Everyone's reddit account gets associated with one address that gets spent from all the time presumably. And it would be a pain in the ass for everyone if you had to keep telling people that regularly pay you that they need to update your receiving address after every time you spent money they've sent you in the past.
The only good solution as I see it would be to implement a system in a wallet client whereby any coins sent to a given address are automatically forwarded to another address that hasn't been spent from before. But in such a system I guess you'd need to have the private key to that particular forwarding addressing stored unencrypted on your computer, which is a potential vulnerability in itself.
I don't know, just thinking out loud here.

As US citizens, our own government quite often advocates regime changes in foreign countries by violent military means. And often times, they follow through on that as well.
Here, simply posits that regime change could come about in the US by *peaceful* economic means. Not even by sabotage, or anything, but simply by people *refusing to use US fiat currency any longer*.
And arguably the US government *is* the biggest threat to global peace and stability on the planet right now (way more so than all the countries we've overrun, invaded, attacked, and occupied recently). 
But here you are-- "offended" at for having the umbrage to merely suggest that the US government might be brought down from their seat of power by nonviolent means. Fucking laughable, that.
EDIT: falkvinge wasn't even advocating subversion of the US government with bitcoin (as I had suggested), he was just pointing out that it could be a consequence of the rise of cryptocurrency in light of current US monetary policy.

Cool, thanks! I think it would take me a good long while to fully understand this. Extremely limited python experience and not familiar with those libraries either. I'm curious how your script handles the PIN functionality. It looks like it's designed to accept a 4-digit PIN, and then the code adds 10000 to it (so essentially your PIN becomes a number from 10000-19999)? Then that becomes the number of SHA-1 iterations? Also, do you know how the two passphrase strings get combined in pbkdf2? Are they just concatenated?

Right, that's a good point. Although the targeting of the exploit should be ubiquitous to anyone using TorBrowser without disabling JS (and visiting a compromised onion), the actual injected shell code wouldn't be able to execute on anything other than Windows.
[This post]( seems to suggest that at least:


The code only makes sense in 32 bit mode. It refers to "ws2_32" and "IPHLPAPI". It accesses the NT Thread Information Block to get a pointer to the NT Process Environment block. I would expect the shellcode to crash on Ubuntu, or any other non-Windows. It might work under Wine.

Most Chinese use private fee-based VPNs if they want to bypass the Great Firewall. I think the CCP blacklists known VPN-associated IPs pretty often though... it's kind of a cat-and-mouse-game. Still, VPN appears to be the best solution.
TOR is quite difficult from China. Not impossible though. The torproject.org website is blocked obviously. But even if you get TorBrowser from an alternate source, then you're still not unfucked. The CCP performs network mapping to get all IPs associated with the Tor network, which they then blacklist. Also, they do deep packet inspection on internet traffic to try to detect the characteristic pattern of the TLS handshake protocol which initiates a connection to the Tor network. If they detect it, they shut down your connection automatically. The new version of TorBrowser (as of Jan or so) now has the pyobfsproxy tool built in, which should solve the DPI issue. New releases of TorBrowser sometimes also contain updated lists of bridge IPs to help with the first issue (but these probably get summarily mapped and blocked in time too). I think the best solution in China to get around Tor Network IP blockage, is to have a friend abroad set up a private bridge IP for you on their computer and allocate some bandwidth.

If he's going to be calling attention to how stupid, arbitrary, and stifling the laws surrounding MSBs are, then that's a good think in my eyes. 
All these barriers to people transacting together are just setting us back, taking up our precious time, hurting innovation, and infringing on financial privacy.
I just hope his lawsuit leads to a reappraisal and maybe an abandonment of all this AML/FinCEN/MSB nonsense, rather than compel the court to actually start forcing additional regulatory compliance on the defendants.
In other words, although it would admittedly be more just if the laws were applied more equally than they are now (as in the case of Greenspan's FaceCash vis a vis his defendants)-- I think more justice would be had by all if the laws were not enforced on any of these parties, Greenspan included.

Right, I do take your point that it's not as easy to change in the US as in many other countries, due to federalism. Executions would have to be banned for federal offenses by the federal government, by the military, and also banned in the 34 state jurisdictions where it is used. I suppose it's not impossible.

If you've ever spent any time researching the death penalty (which it sounds like you definitely have) then you'll know there are many arguments against it. One is purely fiscal. It actually costs taxpayers less to feed and clothe a prisoner for a life sentence than it does to pay for the cost of the endless court dates, appeals, and so forth that accompany capital offenders. Another good argument against the death penalty rests on the rate of false positives in the justice system. It is far from a perfect system so there are miscarriages of justice, some of which result in someone being put on death row and executed. Some would argue that the benefit of *not* executing one person wrongly outweighs any possible benefit of executing 100 people correctly. The problem with the death penalty is it is irreversible. Sometimes, unfortunately, exculpatory evidence is found after prisoners are executed.

@_date: 2013-09-23 08:52:02
Yeah, thanks, that's interesting stuff. 
I kind of figured the SEC *would* claim jurisdiction over that sort of thing. But perhaps if the exchange is located in a different country it would make enforcement somewhat more difficult. (Not that the US government isn't known for strong-arming financial infrastructure of other countries).
Plus with a bitcoin securities exchange the people purchasing assets are pseudonymous. It's hard to claim or prove that known US customers are actually engaging in asset purchase on these sites. Then again, they might just make the argument that all that matters is that it is possible for a customer to do so.
This whole thing sort of reminds me of the situation with bitcoin gambling (which I guess is not wholly dissimilar to bitcoin securities investments). But anyway my point is that since online gambling is also illegal in the states, some of the sites (Satoshi Dice, notably) instituted policies where they said no US customers (not that this is enforceable in practice, but it is a good faith effort to try to appease the wrath of the US government). Perhaps Satoshi Dice even started banning US IP addresses, I don't remember (again, not that that isn't circumventable). As you may recall, the prediction market InTrade also instituted a similar policy banning US customers. And they were based in Ireland IIRC.

Kind of mind boggling that someone with as many coins as he did (and in his line of work) would not be ultra-paranoid about secure storage.
Makes me wonder if the seized coins were just a part of his fortune. He probably had more coins that *were* stored in a more secure fashion. 
The seized coins were possibly coins he earned in the early days when there wasn't as much security awareness or security procedures. Perhaps he never bothered to transfer the coins to a more secure storage method. That's just my take anyway.

Well it sounds like they do implement SSL with PFS for communicating to and from their servers. Could that be causing lag?
Yes I agree it's a bit disappointing currently, because it sounds like their servers see cleartext. But their "at least for now" qualifier makes it seem like their goal is to have the encryption done client side eventually though.
Then again, if they make that tweak, to implement real security, then that automatically means they are Helping The Terrorists, and so since they are based in the US (like Lavabit was) this may mean the government gives them a secret order to build a backdoor or deliberately nerf the encryption.
Still I think the app has potential.

Totally agree with you. 
It surprises me that so many people are saying the government was justified in their actions, or that it was a good thing that happened. It's delusional. A lot of people are just taking the position "Oh, Gox didn't do the paperwork right, they broke the law in the US, they fucked up". Well, first of all, like you say, that they even "broke the law" is a dubious claim at best. And besides, *there are no actual laws* surrounding bitcoins, only vague guidelines issued by FinCEN in the last couple months. Should that justify asset seizure? I don't think so. And anyway, the real question we should be asking is not "did Gox break the law (aka ill-defined guidelines)?", but rather, "Is the DHS seizing Gox's assets in the public interest?". I would argue no. It's a waste of time and resources, and an abuse of power. It sets a shitty precedent and will have a chilling effect on bitcoin-related business in the US.
No matter peoples' personal feelings about Mt. Gox (and I realize many people do have legitimate beef with their performance), Gox should not have been subjected to the seizure. The government's actions were a huge overreach.
And does anyone think the judge who signed off on the warrant really understood the situation? Or understands bitcoins? I kind of doubt it. I mean, was justice served in this instance? Let's review. Gox (or Mutum Sigillum) were NEVER given a warning by ICE or DHS that they were not conforming to the guidelines. They were never given an opportunity to cooperate and comply with the MSB registration hoops to jump through. They were never given an opportunity to protest being classified as an MSB. The proceedings were carried out completely in secret. Major assets were seized before Gox ever had a chance to answer or respond to what they have been accused of. It sounds about as just as the MegaUpload takedown to me. 
Why should people be happy about the government poking their nose into affairs that they don't understand? If people swallow this, it will just encourage further bullshit in the future. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if the only motivating factor in this case was greed. It's quite possible that ICE/DHS will retain all of the money they seized (which could be quite a lot) due to asset forfeiture laws (aka legalized government theft).
I hope Mt. Gox won't be bullied. I hope they fight this in the courts, kind of like what Kim Dotcom did after the US Government wronged him.
The only positives I can see coming out of this situation are if A) Gox fights this in court and wins, which would hopefully discourage the US govt from engaging in this kind of strong-arming in the future, and B) if this event spurs development of a distributed type exchange which is more resistant to shutdown.

However, I remain faithful in the ability of new technology to  allow us to continually evolve beyond their reach. Bitcoin is living proof. A rare genetic recombinant that will offer increased fitness in a landscape fraught with state power and overreach.
Really, all the government is doing is applying more selective pressure for value transfers to move even further out of their grasp and purview. Similar to the way using antibiotics can spur the evolution of 'superbugs'.

When I was talking about how actual mixing works, I was addressing your assertion that Casascius was a 'surefire way to launder coins'. Previously you also claimed that 'It is impossible to get better at mixing than someone taking BTC and giving a paper wallet to someone else.' Those are bold claims and I still don't think you've supported them. As to the second claim, I think for most people, the best mixing would be a service that was nigh-instantaneous, and cheap -- not one that involved postal mail and high fees. As to your first claim, it's only 'surefire' if the person receiving coins and giving out paper wallets is careful to either completely sever or greatly obfuscate any traceable links for the coins between the receiving and sending step. So if anyone were to try to use Casascius as a coin mixer, they would have to be certain that the operator used a methodology in line with that principle. Anything less, and the coins are vulnerable to blockchain tracking analysis. Could anyone be certain he was doing it that way? He certainly didn't publish any kind of coin scrambling methodology on his site (unlike how mixer websites do). If I was looking to get my coins mixed/laundered, and I was going to have to pay a 20% premium for Casascius, and wait for the physical coins to go through the post, you can bet I'd want to be damn certain that there was adequate mix methodology! For the foregoing reasons, I still maintain that there was very little risk of anyone laundering money through Casascius.
Whether or not Casascius was running afoul of FinCEN guidelines and/or the law is a separate claim. Saying he obviously falls under FinCEN regulations because FinCEN said so is a completely tautological argument.  It's easy for you to rationalize it this way post hoc, but I doubt that if you looked at Casascius's business a month ago, armed with a copy of 31 USC § 5330(d)(1), that you'd be able to determine, prima facie, that Casascius fell under the definition. It's easy for you to claim this now, as FinCEN has already arbitrarily made their decision. But it is not at all obvious from the US code governing such matters. For instance, 31 USC § 5330(d)(1)(B) specifies that one precondition for being classified as a money transmitting business is that your business is "required to file reports under section 5313". Section 5313 concerns reporting transactions with depository institutions. Transacting with depository institutions was never a core part of Casascius's business, since for customer funds, they dealt exclusively with bitcoins, and never with fiat. Customer funds never touched a bank. In addition, 5313 contains all sorts of mandatory exemptions for reporting including "Any business or category of business the reports on which have little or no value for law enforcement purposes", which I would argue Casascius falls under (since Casascius is neither a good coin mixer nor coin laundry, and the vast, vast majority of their business is just people sending bitcoin to them so that they can have them converted to special physical bitcoins in return). So I don't see how FinCEN's actions are justifiable by reading the actual laws that are supposed to govern their behavior. It really looks as if they overstepped their bounds.
As for the Coinjoin server at sharedcoin.com, I wouldn't class this as a business exactly. They don't themselves charge any fees. There's only a fee that goes to pay miners. It is a free service. They don't have 'customers', just users. It's not 'doing business in the United States'. It's not *in* the United States. It's in cyberspace. The domain name is registered in Panama. All it is, at its essence, is a free-to-use server. As I said before, the server never holds or controls user funds. How exactly is someone breaking the law by running this server? What law, specifically, are they breaking? 
And your claims about Mt Gox are false. The US government never seized bitcoins from Mt Gox. Perhaps you're thinking of the time in May when DHS and ICE used civil asset forfeiture laws to seize two USD-denominated bank accounts, *in America*, totaling ~$5mil (One at Veridian Credit Union of Iowa, which was for doing business with Dwolla, and one at Wells Fargo) which belonged to Mt Gox's Delaware company subsidiary called Mutum Sigillum. 
If you were just bringing that up to prove that the government are thugs then yes I agree. But I don't see how this proves that the operators of sharedcoin.com are likely to have their domain seized. It would seem that the government at least needs some sort of flimsy justification loosely based on the law in order to do so. So I ask you again, what US law is the operator of a Coinjoin server breaking?

Well, evidently, it would only affect bitcoin/CC users who are buying from retailers that do over 1m in out-of-state sales. The law makes an exception for smaller retailers-- they are exempt.
As for bitspend, I seem to recall in one of their reddit Q&amp;A's that they were already looking into establishing a presence outside of Florida in a no-sales-tax state (like NH). This way, their anonymous remailer service would also have the benefit of sidestepping any sales tax the customer might ordinarily be charged. If the Internet Sales Tax does become law, and if bitspend did establish a warehouse presence in no-sales-tax territory, then I can see this service becoming even more popular potentially (especially for expensive purchases like electronics, and computers). Also, I fail to see how anything I just mentioned would be illegal. It's just an easy loophole for circumventing the law without breaking it.

If we're having a rant here, I'm happy to join.
FinCEN really outdid themselves with this one.
The service Casascius performed was analogous to someone sending him a lump of gold, and him minting it into a coin and sending it back. Or, perhaps, someone sending him a stock certificate or a bank note and having him frame it for them and send it back. Is this money transmission? Obviously not. The customer has the instrument of monetary value, they give it to the merchant, who reforms/repackages it, and then it is returned to the original owner. A closed loop.
Mike did the same thing. It clearly states on his site "I only accept Bitcoins for payment for these items.  I do not accept any form of national currency such as Dollars or Euros for my products". He never dealt in fiat currency! All he did was take a customer's bitcoins, and then repackage them into a physical coin (taking a fee in the process). Obviously this is not money transmission!
FinCEN argues that there's nothing keeping someone from sending bitcoins to Casascius, and then specifying that their physical bitcoins be mailed to a different person. This is just patently absurd.  If this ever even happened, then it was probably an infinitesimally tiny minority of customers. Besides, if I was trying to send bitcoins to someone as a way to launder money or fund Terrorism what-have-you (FinCEN's jurisdiction), I WOULD JUST FUCKING SEND THEM THROUGH THE NETWORK. Not through Casascius! 
Even if Casascius was clearly doing 'money transmission', should they honestly have to answer to this bureaucracy? No. FinCEN wasn't even a thing until 1990. And we were fine without it. Just like we were fine without the Patriot Act (which gave FinCEN still more power). FinCEN should be abolished. It adds no net value to our lives. In fact it adds negative value. It's actions cause a drain on productivity, and ironically, it is funded by siphoning money out of the productive sectors of the economy. It is a commerce killer. It is an enemy of the right of a person to transact freely. 
Perhaps their goal isn't wholly misguided (trying to fight crime) but the costs are too high. In order to carry out their mission, they erode our financial privacy, rob us of the freedom to do with our money what we like without being harassed, impede commerce, and often snuff out financial innovation in its crib. Maybe more 'crime' happens without FinCEN. I don't know. Maybe a whole lot less bullshit happens too. 
Should all the crime FinCEN fights even be a crime? Is FinCEN's the best approach for eliminating the kind of crime it fights? NO on both questions. Some of the laws FinCEN concerns itself with are just 'money laundering' laws. As in, "you did something we consider suspicious with your money, which is a crime"! If you were under the false impression that this is a free country, and you made one $5000 deposit into your bank today, and another tomorrow, you could get in trouble with FinCEN and potentially the law because it looks as if you were 'structuring' bank deposits to circumvent the $10,000 mark which triggers more transaction reporting scrutiny. 
And what about the approach of using FinCEN to fight 'financial crime' in the first place? Their biggest two charges are disrupting terrorism and drug trafficking by fighting terrorist financing and drug-related money laundering. Incidentally, terrorism and drug trafficking are *already crimes*, so I don't know why we have to go and also make it a crime to try to pull off or get away with the first crime. But if you're trying to stamp out terrorism or the drug trade, here's a spoiler. It's never going to work by trying to confiscate or stop them from using their money. It's just whack-a-mole. They'll find a way. A better approach is to actually hit the root of the problems. 
The first and easiest way to reduce terrorism is for our government to stop giving arms/money to terrorist groups abroad in the first place. That one's a no-brainer. Second is to not give them such a reason to hate us. Spoiler: they do not 'hate us for our freedom'. If that were true, most of their hate would have dissipated by now, for we are far from free. Most terrorists, I would argue, become terrorists because they have a legitimate gripe coupled with a sense of desperation (they're powerless, facing an asymmetrical enemy, and can't conduct conventional warfare against it). Chances are we've bombed a bunch of civilians in their country and/or invaded it. Let's stop doing that shit and start trying to make amends for all the shit we've unleashed on these people for no good reason. 
As for drug trafficking? End the War on Drugs, decriminalize everything, and you've solved most of the problem right there. Decriminalizing increases the supply of drugs, drives prices down, and profits from the drug trade aren't as huge. Much of the trade of drugs becomes safe and licit. Cartels go out of business. 
And does FinCEN even have a whole lot to show for all the power they're given? They're great at going after the little guys. Like Iraqi-Americans sending money back to relatives who have to live in a hellhole of bombed-out infrastructure and depleted uranium thanks to America. Like hawaladars who help remit money back to countries that Western Union won't touch. Or like Casascius here! Meanwhile, as they're preoccupied with fucking over little people, HSBC can launder billions of drug money right under their noses (but then only get a little slap on the wrist after they're caught). What a crock of shit.
The government has clearly overstepped even the very permissive boundaries it sets for itself in this case. I hope everyone who was cheering for government regulation is paying attention. This is what it looks like. The Ministry of Financial Thoughtcrime's boot crushing the face of a man who's done absolutely nothing wrong except trying to make a living.

OP here. I left it a little open-ended on purpose I suppose; I'm not one to tell people what they must or mustn't do with their own money. But I did want to bring up some historical perspective and hopefully inspire people to think about the issue, reach their own conclusions, and act or speak out accordingly.
My personal opinion right now is that schemes such as CoinValidation are potentially quite toxic and that fundamentally damaging the fungibility of bitcoin should be avoided. I think the concept of colored coins (basically, an issuer denoting a satoshi as a stand-in for another asset that can be traded accordingly) is great. I'm all for that. But I am against blacklisting, redlisting, etc. I think doing this for whatever reason (even miners blacklisting transactions from the FBI's seized coin stash) will open up a real can of worms. From there it's a slippery slope. Fungibility and frictionless commerce is one of bitcoin's greatest assets. Blocked transactions and mandatory identity-tied transactions are things that bitcoin should strive to obsolete, not recreate.
I plan to boycott any businesses that enroll in a blacklisting/redlisting scheme. If anyone else is persuaded by my arguments, then I hope they will too.

In fact, if one was paying attention at all to what's been going on in the online bitcoin securities exchange world (or even in the bitcoin gambling world a while back), then it would've been evident that Ukyo shutting his doors to US persons was a pretty likely scenario all things considered.

As far as buying bitcoins in the US goes, there is some competition. Localbitcoins has been around for awhile and is just as easy to use as Coinbase. You can even do cash deposits using localbitcoins, if you would like to purchase more privately/discreetly. This method is really fast too. There's also the CampBX exchange in the US, I don't know too much about the difficulty factor of buying from there though. And of course, Mt Gox, but the bitcoin price is always higher there since USD withdrawals take weeks.
There used to be more competition. BitInstant shut down temporarily in order to sort out regulatory compliance (they ought to be back soon I think). Bitfloor was hacked and kept going for a while longer but then their bank dropped them, so they're gone.
Why has Coinbase done so well? They received a fuckton of VC backing, which has enabled them to hire lawyers and become registered as a  money service business (MSB) with FinCEN at the federal level (this ain't cheap folks). IIRC they are not registered as a money transmitter in each state/territory/jurisdiction in the US though (which could become an issue in the future, since violating a state money transmitter law is a federal crime now under 18 usc 1960). Also I'm not sure which bank they use but somehow they've been able to maintain/cultivate a good relationship with them because it seems like they're one of the only major US bitcoin exchangers that hasn't had this problem of their bank(s) dropping them. Again, being awash in VC money and having attained some degree of regulatory certitude probably helps their relationship with the legacy banking sector greatly.
More competition is coming. BitInstant should be back soonish. EasyCoin (A subsidiary of Neo&amp;Bee in Cyprus) is launching service in the US soon where you can deposit money at any ZipZap location to buy bitcoin.
But yeah, I'd say the biggest obstacles right now for competition in this space are getting regulatory licensing and having access to banking. Localbitcoins kind of ingeniously sidesteps all this because the company only offers a platform for people to trade amongst eachother (like craigslist) but sometimes with escrow. So in essence localbitcoins isn't really one exchange business, it's thousands of people that perform this service themselves, empowered by the site.

Perhaps some of his computer hardware still contained a wallet file with unencrypted keys that unlocked the coins.
Encrypted bitcoin wallets wasn't a feature in Bitcoin-Qt until 2012 I think. DPR had already been running the site earlier than that.
So I think it's possible that DPR wasn't super careful about ensuring key encryption for some of the coins earned in the early days... Perhaps he continued to store coins in addresses of whose private keys remained unencrypted in his device's memory (in some form).
If he wasn't careful about evacuating old coins to new addresses that had been generated with pre-encrypted private keys by Qt client, such a situation could have happened. Even if he 'deleted' old unencrypted wallet files after transitioning to encrypted wallet files, unless he zeroed out all the data where unencrypted private keys had ever been stored, they would be recoverable through forensic analysis by a determined attacker.

Please, I can assure you I'm not heedlessly spouting off my mouth. 
I am actually in the process of reviewing the [seizure warrant]( as we speak.
I can confirm that monetary assets (namely a Dwolla account belonging to Mt Gox subsidiary Mutum Sigillum LLC) were indeed seized and dispossessed under **civil forfeiture** law.
Here's the relevant passages:




And also the following passage:








Here's some additional explanation:
The statute allegedly violated was (18 U.S.C. section 1960). This is a law pertaining to mandating registration of money transmitters (MSBs) with state agencies. The law was passed in 1992. And it was also amended two years later to additionally require registration federally with the US Treasury. The effects of the law actually did not come into effect until late 2001. The PATRIOT Act modified this statute even further. It struck any *mens rea* protections of the accused, lowered the burden of proof of contravention to simple Probable Cause, and also extended the government's power to include civil asset forfeiture instead of just criminal asset forfeiture. Civil asset forfeiture is actually what was invoked in the warrant [ 18 U.S.C. section 981(a)(1)(A)]. For a distinction between the two forms of asset forfeiture, please [read this](
For more background on (18 U.S.C. section 1960), I found [this legal bulletin]( to be an excellent primer.
After reading the seizure warrant further, there was actually a second Mt Gox bank account (at Wells Fargo) that was subjected to seizure civil asset forfeiture earlier. This warrant was issued by a different judge, and was issued 5 days earlier:

Honestly I have had trouble figuring out what CoinValidation's plans are exactly. There's a dearth of information on their website.
If as you suggest, they're merely associating an address/addresses with an identity, and then requiring coins spent at participating businesses to be spent from those addresses, then that doesn't really accomplish their stated goal of transacting 'clean' coins. Anyone can now 'launder' whatever coins they wish to through one of the "Validated" addresses.
To transact in 'clean' coins one needs, in fact, to follow the entire transaction history of the coins. That's what they'd need to do. And that's where it gets shitty for the consumer.
Say I buy a bitcoin off an exchange, but unbeknownst to me, the seller's coin was previously associated with a Silk Road address. Now they won't let me spend it through CoinValidation-approved services.
Anyway, like I said, I'm having a hard time understanding what exactly their plan is based on a lack of available information.
If you like, consider my post as a response to what a CoinValidation-like service could easily devolve into.

IIRC the DPI is used by Chinese govt (for instance) to recognize a TLS handshake that initiates the TOR network connection. However there's a script called pyobfsproxy (sp?) that can defeat this attack. It's actually inbuilt in the current version of TorBrowser. 
The network mapping attack you alluded to is trickier to get around. I know the Chinese govt employs this in order to blacklist all IPs associated with TOR nodes. The best countermeasure for this is to have fresh nodes to choose from or have someone volunteer to run a bridge proxy for you using a non-blacklisted IP.

Because they're sort of given to usurping authority, I suppose.
The US and its allies don't need *actual* sovereign authority or jurisdiction to do such things. They can lean on other countries and bully them into complying with their whims. I.e. "Do what we want or we cut you off from the international banking system/raise tariffs on goods from your country/impede foreign investment". If the US really wanted to shut down a virtual securities market in another country I think they could do it. Sure, it would take a while and expend some diplomatic capital and so forth. But they could do it if they really wanted to. All they'd need to do is lean enough on another country's government, and that government will probably carry out an enforcement for them in their own country.

Well shit, I'm interested. I assumed people would've thought of this sort of solution before. I'm pretty new to crypto myself.
What was your idea for key stretching? Salt-based, or iterative hashing? It seems that one could conceivably generate their own salt table to use for such a purpose, but then they'd have to ensure they never lost it. I prefer the iterative hashing approach since all you'd really need to remember for rederivation is a passphrase and a PIN.
That being said, SHA256 might not be the best choice for the iterative hashing... I think it would be more vulnerable to bruteforce by bitcoin mining-specific ASIC machines (which have seen some... proliferation of late). So perhaps another algorithm should be employed. SHA512 maybe, hell even MD5 ought to work. The most important thing is for the possible PIN ranges to correspond to enough computing work that it would disincentivise bruteforcing by attackers (even attackers with ASICs, which is why SHA256 might not be the best choice).

If it has only received, then the address is not exposed.
It's only when you spend coins that you have to prove ownership of that address and then broadcast the public key of the address as part of the transaction push.
To clarify,
The bitcoin address is actually a cryptographic hash of the public key. Knowing the public key, you can easily calculate the corresponding bitcoin address. However, knowing the address, it is exceedingly difficult to reverse engineer the public key from the address.
Likewise, the public key and private key have a similar relationship, whereby knowing the public key alone, it is exceedingly difficult to reverse engineer the private key-- unless, that is, there is some sort of vulnerability or poor implementation of the cryptographic  function that was used to generate the public/private key pair. This is the particular attack vector that we're discussing here.
That is my simplistic understanding of it at least.
So yes, if you have sent from an address before, the safest option is to not store coins in that address any longer and use a fresh address. Many bitcoin clients actually automate this if you spend from an address but don't use up all the coins that were in that address-- the client will send the unspent coins to a fresh address.

Umm... Why *would* he respond to you? No offense, but there is a non-zero possibility  that you could actually be something like your username suggests, and trying to lay a trap for him.
Say you've found an IPv4 you think is connected to SR, by some kind of intelligence means. Say the evidence is still too shaky to justify a search warrant of property that is associated with that IP. Well, you just send a GPGed PM to DPR providing him the hashed IPv4 and a story about how you found it, then wait for a response (hoping he'll slip up and say something which indicates your suspected IPv4 address is connected to him). Meanwhile, make posts to reddit with titles sure to get upvotes. Assuming DPR is a reader of and/or (a safe assumption!), it would be observed by him and provide a more compelling backstory that might make him slip-up and not realize the possibility that it is all a trap.
To account for this possibility, DPR's best move is to assimilate the info you've provided him, act on it if necessary, but NOT RESPOND IN ANY WAY.
As the person behind SR, I think he has every reason to be that paranoid, and to practice very rigorous opsec.

No. I don't think this is the case *at all*, for the reasons I stated previously on thread. Let me reiterate. A good mixing service algorithmically ensures that the coins you are sent have no 'taint' from the coins you sent in. Casascius has no way of guaranteeing this, because they're actually not a mixing service! I don't know much about the internals of the business, but there's no reason to believe that the coins you send them aren't *the exact same ones they load onto the coins you've bought*. Certainly this would seem like the easiest way for them to do it. So the parsimonious assumption here is that no coin mixing goes on. Therefore I can't think of any good reason to use them as a mixing service when there's no good reason to believe they mix coins before sending out, to say nothing of the fact that there are much better alternatives out there.


That is a dubious statement. Blockchain.info (I believe they run the other "sharedcoin.com" mixer I linked also) is not a US company. They are in the UK if memory serves. They are not within FinCEN's bailiwick. Besides, the CoinJoin trustless mixing protocol that sharedcoin.com uses is just that, a protocol. You don't even necessarily need a special entity (server) to facilitate a CoinJoin transaction. 3 people could meet up on IRC and do it. Are they breaking the law by doing so? I should point out that when using CoinJoin on sharedcoin.com, the server can at no point steal the coins. They are never in possession of the coins! If they're never in possession of the coins, how can they be transmitting money? Will you revise your opinion that they are a money transmitter and breaking the law?


You may not be a FinCEN advocate, but you sure are a FinCEN apologist. If I'm not mistaken, you're clearly in the "they had it coming because they didn't follow the law/guidelines" camp. If you think the laws are stupid then why argue that people should follow them? Unjust laws ought to be broken, no?

With respect to the 'random' seizure of fake IDs coming from Canada, I agree with you. Parallel construction as fuck.
I hope he can afford a good attorney that's wise to the gov's dirty parallel construction tactics. Get some evidence tossed out since it was illegally obtained.

What I want to know is how were they caught/tracked down? I hope their lawyers make a point to scrutinize for any possibility of parallel construction from illegally collected NSA domestic spying tips. In light of recent NSA disclosures, this should be standard practice for defense lawyers of clients accused of crimes involving computers.

Thanks. Very cogent explanation. Nice chart too.
I'm really curious how much money was in those accounts. Anyone know if this is find outtable?

Yeah, although it's easy to lull yourself to sleep by saying "oh, they'll never go after me", it's actually pretty fucked. Here's the problem with vacuuming in massive amounts of data and storing it in Bluffdale Utah for all eternity:
- It allows for retroactive policing. OK, you're not doing anything wrong now. But what if you get into some shit later on? What if you piss off the government somehow? What if you join an antiwar group, or become a political dissident, or a war tax resistor? What if you've been a cryptoanarchist this whole time? What if the government all of a sudden declares bitcoin transactions to be illegal in the US? The retroactive policing means that if they want to take you down, *they'll have at their disposal anything you've ever done online or on a phone*.
- It allows for selective prosecution. This is already a problem to some extent, but the NSA's domestic data spying will exacerbate it. With the monumental amount of laws on the books, it means that that most of us probably commit crimes every day, probably without even knowing it in many cases. Now combine that with overzealous prosectors, and a motive for the government targeting you, and you've got a huge problem. Adding in the government having at their disposal anything you've ever done online or on a phone? Priceless. And who the feds choose to go after using their newfound capabilities is pretty much at their discretion. Political targets could easily be singled out and repressed with such a system, while leaving 'loyalists' untouched, even though they might actually be just as bad in the eyes of the law.
I mean, really, if you told this stuff to East German Stasi, they'd pitch tents in their trousers. 
If we don't do something, none of us are really safe.

I sort of arrived at the same conclusion myself. The existence of an effort such as CoinValidation may be enough to placate lawmakers (especially if they're in contact with committees) and satisfy some concerns these legislators/bureaucrats undoubtedly have about bitcoin, at this crucial juncture when some far-reaching decisions may be about to occur in the US. 
As sinister and threatening as CoinValidation seems though, can it really work in practice? Based on the appropriately negative and loud response from the bitcoin community regarding the implementation of such a scheme, I think CoinValidation will probably just fizzle out. Even if some retailers/businesses do conform to their system, I expect most bitcoin users will opt to route around the damage, thereby making it a liability to implement CoinValidation.
It's anyone's guess, but that's just how I see it playing out in my head.

Yeah I saw that. You can't see it if you look at 'altoid' post history because the post was deleted. But it's not like that erased the original post. In fact, someone on the original thread quoted altoid's post.
