crypto market
btc is a cryptocurrency, this is a cryptomarket app (looks robust)
Welcome to the really really free market
powered by darkwallet, unSYSTEM unlimited
*reddit says:
"Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet:"
Internet market (dont like)
crypto trade
crypto trading
crypto exchange
crypto dealing
crypto swap
puts attention in the act more than in the place (verb moves more than noun, even useful as a slogan) trade could also easily be get as noun more than these others, "the" trade, the "exchange"
p2p market 
distributed market
(has a wow, maybe too much..)
marketplace (redundant)
x shop (sounds a bit cool enough, but dont get to get "the trade of services" maybe)
* 
objects place (is far too philosophical, unless very accurate cos could include the sharing and gifting of assets in the place, which market don't) (i.e. )
unDeal (lol)
unMarket (looks a bit geeky)
darkmarket and freemarket are not bad either cos have buzz, and as crypto market they all refer to a broad activity, probably not able to be reducted to an app or api. 
i.e. etsy would not want to have all online shops in theirs.. i may want to have a market powered by *market app that are banning certain products i guess. i.e. eco market powered by ... darkwallet
darkwallet could be enough, i don't put adverts in my wallet, but with the net is posible :)
darkcomms, free comms, i suspect 
sharkmarket (troling)
rayless market (bah)
