Great to see how many of the larger Bitcoin companies are adopting multi-signature. Always make sure you generate the private key online. 
You don't own the bitcoins if you don't control the private keys!

That's a great idea, no need to explain what a Bitcoin Address or a wallet is , just bam, here it is. Have your mBTCs. 
Just sent to 10 friends, spent $50 bucks!

That's great! I really like what these guys are doing, specially the BIP32 system.

This is a very big achievement. It think Bitcoin whole would be much more safe if other wallets did the same.

Great to see so many Bitcoin companies been pro-active, Coinbase and Coinkite seem to be on the ball now. Any reposts on Blockchain.info?

This article is ok, the original blogpost or the "inside bitcoin" writeup is better.

WTF is wrong with this community. Only negative things get praise, any positive news or posts get this kind of "you must be working for them" kind of comment. Yes, I like Coinkite, BitPay, Coinbase and Blockchain, these are people who are committed to Bitcoin. 
Fuck this kindergarten shit, **grow up.**
