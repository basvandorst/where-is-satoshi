How complicated is the string proceeding  I'm sure it wasn't bitstamp was it?

And merchant pays 2.5% - 3.5% fee of every CC transaction you make ;)

I really can't believe people still make that mistake...

The passphrase is like a next word in your seed that **you** get to choose. And to restore your wallet you need **all** the words.
@_date: 2017-03-03 09:34:27
A funny thought, all the ppl who **lost** money on MtGox might actually get **more** back, if $BTC goes above $3k...
@_date: 2017-03-26 10:27:13
Just tweet the correct implementation you "accidentally found" on pastebin ��
@_date: 2017-03-02 06:42:24
Is there any 1000 of currency that BTC hasn't yet passed left?
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:00:00
Once we have 2nd layer solution in place, fees will adjust accordingly. Keep in mind that miners need to make profit, and price of $BTC will likely rise long term.
@_date: 2017-03-03 10:09:37
While it is true, it has nothing to do with what I said. BTC value was indeed set to asses how much everybody lost in JPY. However, mtgox    assets include a lot of bitcoin, which sold will cover all the loses (and possibly more, but the more part depends on many other factors too...).

I think everyone here would prefer to argue over which Lightning Network implementation is the best.
@_date: 2017-03-02 07:15:02
So much this. I sometimes think that BU people once had an ok argument, and now even though the context has changed completely they refuse to re-evaluate and just find excuses to keep their opinion unchanged.
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:55:57
I was shocked by that too…
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:56:11
Just FYI: you can select many options. I think 2 + 4 covers what you're saying.

Apparently the only way to get silver/gold/platinum with Bitcoin (LN supported too!) is if you make a comment/post somewhere and then use [Bitrefill]( on it.  Guess why I wrote this comment ��.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:54:15
It's not about block size any more. It's about blocking segwit... (And, if possible, shifting control to miners)
@_date: 2017-03-03 10:12:05
Also, it's just a **possibility**, things might not go that direction at all. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:02:28
₿adger don't care
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:51:26
yes, please add it :).
@_date: 2019-12-01 17:07:42
Good point, alternative is to have it implemented as BIP21 w/embedded BOLT11, see: 
Bitcoin is Bitcoin, let the wallet figure out the protocol, same way you don't need to be bothered how your browser chooses between http, grpc, tcp, etc, etc.
Can see it in action here: hodl.studio:2048

They will not be available, until everything is properly reviewed, tested, and built in a deterministic way. Until then you can either just signal for UASF on your "normal" full node, or compile the code yourself. Instructions for both has been posted on Twitter and this subreddit multiple times already ;).
@_date: 2017-04-01 05:33:15
How about negligible fees, instant confirmations, more anonymous, easier, less error prone and peer to peer?
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:34:14
If you want it bigger run [this]( If enough people run it we can gradually adjust the design.
@_date: 2019-12-08 03:51:32
1. Privacy.  You spending money received to the same address twice, links both transactions as done by a single person.
2. Security.  Before spending your funds are protected by 2 layers of security: a one way has function, and asymmetric cryptography.  The first time you spend money received this that address/script, you reveal your public key (the thing hash layer hides), causing your funds to be protected by asynchronity cryptography only.  We have **very** high confidence asymptomatic crypto isn't broken, but it's there's no need to rely on that.
@_date: 2017-04-11 03:52:59
As much as I support UASF, I believe it should not be merged into core, unless there's a widespread community support and even then it should be an opt-in.
@_date: 2017-04-02 20:17:38
Thank you for saying that. I wish more people understood that.
@_date: 2017-04-07 17:26:55
Anyone knows who runs website with these stats?
@_date: 2017-04-03 10:22:41
Doing [this]( should also be possible (with a use of one more script)
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:45:12
Why is it twice the price of Raspberry Pi 3 + 200gb microSD + case?
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:22:11
What are the main risks with UASF? What's the worst and most likely scenario for each?
@_date: 2017-04-01 05:35:41
What's the incentive for miners **not** to spam? They don't pay fees, but the more they spam the more others have to pay in fees...

Proud to be making that Northern Thailand for bigger  ��

Thanks for using my guide - figured by your slightly modified motd ;) - speaking of which you might want to update it as I bumped it with a bunch of useful features (external drive storage and swap overview, addresses at which your node is accessible, etc).
@_date: 2018-07-23 10:30:04
I meant to update the motd/dashboard as it now contains more useful info: [
SWAP on HDD, even though can be slow, is still better than SWAP on the MicroSD (which will kill it in a few months), and SWAP is absolutely necessary to have things run smoothly.
As for the peers, I'm not sure what's the node behaviour during the initial sync, but I'm happy to check if your node is accessible from outside if you share your IP/Tor address (but maybe through DM?).
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:40:18
Thanks for posting here :)
@_date: 2017-06-10 08:39:13
That's a PR way to say they won't implement a transaction replay protection :D

Full Bitcoin node does not need to store the entire history.  Said node would be called "Full Archival Node".  Full node is any node that has performed a _full_ blockchain validation.

Bitcoin blockchain has ~8.5 years (1st block: January 3, 2009)
Ethereum blockchain has less than 2 years (1st block: July 30, 2015)
