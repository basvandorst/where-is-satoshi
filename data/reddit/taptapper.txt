Thank you.  What an idiotic statement.

You didn't pay for data recovery?  People can read the plates. It's not too late if you still have it
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:41:35






I think what catvdog123 said
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:13:45
Hmmm.  Good point.  Maybe talk to a higher-up in the company you choose?
Also, most people that pays for recovery is guaranteed to have data of monetary worth on that drive.  Sure, there are the people recovering their photos, but a lot of it will be money-related.  Only diff is that your data IS the worth, like a paper bearer bond as opposed to an investment account number.  I'd say you should trust the integrity of your recovery co and go for it.  Pick a U.S. based firm, I would definitely NOT trust anyone in India.  Since you're in a metro area find someone local you can go to.  Good luck dude

"Fiat holders"?
Doesn't the "fiat" in your pocket that you use to buy shit make you a "fiat holder"?
I love the clip, but seriously dude.  If you lost internet tomorrow the fiat in your pocket is how you'd pay for anything.  We BC owners are lucky and some were insightful, but "holding fiat" does not make you a bum on the street

I started w coinbase shortly after they opened.  Back when they had phone support and emails were answered in 30 mins or less.  I always thought Mt Gox smelled bad so I didn't go with them.  
Lately CB has had issues, I think due to the insane volume.  Manual verification is safer for holders but it causes tons of delays.  Too bad.  But I prefer delays to losing EVERYTHING through theft and fraud.
They've been great for me, and when they made a mistake (one of my withdrawals didn't happen) they gave me $5 in bc by way of apology.
I know this is an unpopular opinion on here, so bring on the downvotes.  I'm in the U.S. and I'm sticking w CB

The instant pic thing is buggy imho.  I had the same trouble setting up a friend. Go through the setup unverified.  Then take your own pics, save them to your pc and upload them.  ID front and back, and a face pic.  That works
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:59:20


Opportunity for WHAT?  The Cachet bus has left the terminal. 
Opportunity for universally accepted method of payment? 
Opportunity to be held like a metal in hopes of an increase in value?  
Oh, I know.  The Opportunity to be pumped by shills fronting for state actors?  In that case yes, you're right.  Bitcoin missed That Opportunity.  Your post should end with [i am a bot]


[i am a bot]
See?  like that 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:25:01


Yeah, that.  Before I had a horrible loss I thought that was valid.  Now that I HAVE suffered a life-altering loss, that has no validity.  Not even close.
Also has no validity regarding fiat and crypto, imho.

Glad to know you can buy a slice of pizza with BC.

Where did the funds come from originally?  
Did the community  contribute, or was it that all the board members owned some when it was $3, then when it hit $300 they had enough to create a "Foundation"?
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:06:46
HA!  That's how I felt at $6!
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:52:11
that's freaking beautiful.  just what i was looking for!  What program did you use to make it?
@_date: 2019-03-03 02:10:17
This has nothing to do with BC.  They're not tracking the purchasing method.  Paying with cash, or potatoes, or a bag of live chickens won't get them cleared for travel.  Having someone else buy the ticket with fairy dust won't matter.  Your ID, checked when you board, is the gatekeeper.
@_date: 2019-03-03 05:14:23
Hell, yeah.  That's how I'd go too.  
But people can't or don't want to add the time necessary for that kind of travel.   The enormous distances are an issue.  Hours long flight that would be days on a train.  Days long train trip that would be weeks on a bus.  People that are used to fast travel can be crippled by these kinds of travel restrictions.   
People who have no legal way to travel are modern-day serfs.  Locked into their patch, working where they are told to, livinging where they are told to, earning what they are told to earn.  Even with money they can't move.  The whole country is effectively a gulag for them.

**"jump the species barrier"**  Great description of connection between crypto and currency.   I've wondered what will happen when there's a rush to cash out.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:50:44
Identity verification or bank?  I've had both probs, maybe I can give you some advice.

Needs to go in the lobby of a BC storefront trading room in Asia.  Too bad Mt. Gox can't take it

When it was around $300 I left $4 in a wallet.  Today it's $147.  Jeez.

Great info, thanks dude
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:47:05
"Send"?  Did you mean charge?  If it's a card they charge you two amounts.  And I feel your pain: recently it took me 3 days to figure out how to a friend get verified, on there and on gdax. 
We had your issue verifying bank accts.  CC linked OK but bank did not.  Try authorizing a wire transaction instead of bank transfer.  It 100% refused to verify for bank transfer from 4 diff banks, but registering it as a wire transfer (same accts!!)  worked instantly. 
I think a lot of the issue with cards is credit card companies refusing BC-related verifications the past few months.  Kind of like when they cut off communicating with online casinos or usenet providers.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:58:43
Put cash into Coinbase, link it to GDAX then transfer instantly to GDAX if you want to day trade.  I haven't done this part yet but I assume the funds can go back to CB as well.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:39:17
When people say there are X bc in existence, they don't account for all the lost coins.  I first heard about bc when it was $2.50.  I did a coding challenge to write a wallet and won 5 bc to put into my new wallet.  I think I wiped it when I was learning to root android.  I needed ooooone more jump drive . . .

So I guess you were raised in a hollow log up until now?  Been off the grid?  Fine then.  Don't buy anything with plastic.  Don't get paid in plastic.   Don't work on the books.  Don't go to school either.  Or register a car or get a drivers license or any kind of insurance. 
There.  Problem solved. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:56:46
Oh, stop.  What kind of troll question is this?  If you use your verified personal info you have the best chance of buying from someone who at least winks at security and verification.  If you want to go stealth you are anonymous but might be dealing with sketchy characters.  
This in true in life, not just in crypto.  Unless you were born last week I don't know how this can be news to you
@_date: 2019-01-22 00:14:43
I also think it's elitist.  What about homeless people?  People that don't use banks?  People that can't get mail?  They do exist.
I won't eat in a cashless joint.  As far as I'm concerned, if I give $10 to a homeless guy he should be able tot buy the takeout that I do.  Also some teenagers get cash allowance.  They can't eat in those place either.  
And cashless means absolutely no privacy.  Every single purchase of any kind will be recorded.   Maybe I don't want marketers to know I'm buying catheters and wart cures.

I live upstate New York.  It is not civilized. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 18:52:15
I know several really awesome places in Chinatown in NYC that are only cash.  Even relatively expensive places including Dim Sum where you can easily hit $100 per person.  In my area, the best 2 Chinese restaurants don't take cards.  The best Mexican food by FAR is from a food truck that doesn't take cards. A few pretty decent spanish and Mexican restaurants don't take cards.  I'm in a rural area and lots of small shops, food establishments and services don't take cards.
Are you saying you never eat street food?  That's sad.  But, Burger King, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, Dominoes, KFC etc will always take cards.  So there's that.  No need to patronize the family owned little places.
I was working in the boroughs of NYC with a co-worker from Seattle.  He was stymied by the parking meters because he never carried cash.  I had to give him the quarters so he could park.  Now they take cards in NYC but in less populated areas you need quarters or you don't park on the street.

Same way they tried to kill PGP and strong encryption.  The U.S. government classified it as a "munition" so having the code was a crime.
Until they realized it was GREAT and banks etc adopted it.
