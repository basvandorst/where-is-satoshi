An exchange took 70% of my bitcoins and blamed it on “fraud”.

I bought at $190 and lost 70% of my coins due to Celery being a shitty exchange. OP’s post makes me feel better.

Mine allows up to $2500.

Thanks! My first dodgecoin!

Considering that kid is from Alpine, New Jersey, chances are *they* are made of money.

Can someone explain reddit "tipping."
@_date: 2014-04-19 14:22:32
I deposit checks to my bank account by taking a photo with my phone. I haven't been to the bank branch in about 2 years.

The TSA is at Newark Penn Station this week because of the Super Bowl in New Jersey... If they tell me to take my shoes off in Penn Station I'm going to tell them to go ef themselves.

For adaptive traffic signals there is.

Because the floor is dirty and cold.

And it didn't even require Revel going out of business.

I bought it on the 14th after reading a lot of posts in this subreddit about how people thought it hit bottom, so I figured what the heck.
@_date: 2015-01-26 02:48:06
I bought my first bitcoin last week and it appreciated almost 50% already. This volatility is crazy. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 02:33:31
I bought my first (and only) in January 2015 for $190... I'm kicking myself for only buying one.

I just lost 70% of my bitcoins to Celery. Where's a better place to offload my coins?
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:56:57
This is why so many people think bitcoin is shady/a scam. Celery gave a "haircut" and took 70% of my bitcoins. I purchased at $190 a coin so I still walked away with more than I originally purchased on US dollars, but only $1900 per coin, not $4400.
Are any online wallets safe? I only used celery because it was touted in this subreddit.
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:38:31
It sounds like the haircut was supposed to just be a few hundred dollars per coin based on the email. But for me it was thousands.

It was over 2 years ago when I got into the game at sub $200 prices.
@_date: 2017-01-02 12:37:03
Some guy posted that day about how he was buying $40k worth because he felt it was at the low and was mocked.  I figured if he could buy $40k I could buy one.
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:50:10
And if he kept it it could have been stolen on MtGox and he’d have closer to $0.

I tried to withdraw $3k in cash at a Chase Bank to pay a contractor working on my house. The bank had to give me most of it in twenties because they didn’t have enough cash on hand.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:44:04
I learned my lesson when used Celery as a wallet and lost a bunch of bitcoin when they did a 70% “hair cut.”
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:48:28
I’ve given up that I’ll ever see my BTH from Celery.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:04:11
I bought in at $180 in 2015... but got 70% of my holdings stolen by Celery.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:40:53
Make sure they tell them to keep them in cold storage. I bought in at $184 a coin and got some of mine stolen using Celery.
@_date: 2015-07-03 11:27:59
I guess it's better than everyone going back to digg.
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:22:37
I bought mine at $190 in 2015 so it’s still up.  With the drop I don’t feel so bad about the ones that were stolen by the exchange I had them on.
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:25:06
Poor Danny Devito.

How do I get my bitcoin out of an exchange? I have mine in celery. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 03:41:11
I bought my first bitcoin in January of this year for $185 because I was jealous of missing out the last few years. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 12:50:36
Mine got stolen in a shitty exchange.
@_date: 2018-12-24 13:30:46
Did you see it in the New Yorker?
