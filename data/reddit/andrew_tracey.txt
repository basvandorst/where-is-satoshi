Surprisingly, they've gotten a lot better about that very quickly.
Wish India would follow suit...

Is there no way to integrate these things into Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:39:50
Dare I ask for an explanation of the difference between Ethereum and BTC, and what it does better or why it's better overall than BTC ("BTC" is the abbreviation for bitcoin, right? Yeah I'm new)?
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:29:59
I didn't interpret anything he's said so far that way, then again I'm not looking for an excuse to, either.

That's investing.  It might be something restricted to what the SEC calls "qualified investors", but it's still investing.
This is less about what you're putting your money in than why and how you're doing it.  You can invest in crypto, you can speculate on crypto.   That's just like with stocks: you can both invest and speculate on them.

It's generally spelled (by Colombians), "hijueputa", and said quickly all as one word, like "ee-hh-way-poo-ta".

Hah, this is all so nostalgic.  I remember editing a friend's webpage as a joke by spoofing my email address to his ISP.
Yes, that's all I had to do, because the way you edited a webpage then was to do the editing on your computer and email it to the ISP and they would post it.

That...is *exactly* how it works, actually.  The overwhelming majority of major currencies in circulation (dollars, euros, pounds sterling) are *not* in paper/physical form, they're merely numbers in digital accounts.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:57:50


Can you not just break them down further and do so indefinitely if need be?  E.g. a tenth of a Satoshi would become the common unit, roughly equivalent to a dollar.
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:46:42
Well, if you understand bitcoin and the market really well and you're inclined to think it's going to go to something like $100k, then you'd continue to hold, wouldn't you?  $10billion is better than $1billion.
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:11:59
Yeah, that's actually really important in getting the masses to adopt it.  Hell, that's more important (to them) than security is (to a point).
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:02:23
The most important thing to the average person, and therefore to making bitcoin popular, is convenience.  Convenience absolutely trumps security and privacy to most people (look at social media).
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:55:05


Who will base their decisions on how popular they think bitcoin will become, and they know that's determined first and foremost by how easy to use it is.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:57:24
Mostly agree, though I disagree that it was never about "sticking it to the man" as it was put, I think it definitely was about that, for a while, to a sizeable portion of people buying and using bitcoin.  I think that still is *one* appeal of it to a lot of people currently using bitcoin.
However, I will add that you're delusional if you think the governments of the world won't manage to regulate crypto currencies.  They will.  It's just that they'll be forced to give up a lot of territory in order to be able to do it, which they'll be willing to do because some control is better than none.  It's not black and white.  They *can* regulate this stuff to some degree, just not as much as traditional government-backed currencies.
Crypto currency is an improvement, therefore it *will* become more widely adopted, it will appeal to people (because it's better, that's the definition of an "improvement": it's something *better* than what you had before) and that will entice those people to buy and use it.
Improvements come in steps, they tend to be smaller, sometimes marginal.  No one change or improvement rarely, if ever, causes a complete 180, pushes things all the way to the opposite end of the spectrum.  *Of course* crypto's aren't going to be this completely unregulated, untouchable-by-the-governments-of-the-world-muahahaha, by-and-for-the-people-yay! currency.  What nonsense, what naive nonsense.
But they *will* be a lot closer to that than traditional, government-backed currencies like the dollar and euro are.  That is what we call "an improvement", and when you have a choice between something and something else that's better, what do you choose?  The thing that's better.
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:51:17
Do we know that they haven't?
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:45:06


And then the derptastic idiots dig in their heels and derp even harder because their egos can't handle being wrong.
Oh wait, this is always the situation regardless of the topic, not just bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:55:46
They determined that they *could* have made it work by strapping a lifejacket to said board, but I really don't think it's unreasonable to expect people in such stressful situations to not think of that at the time.
So yes, quite plausible that it would've indeed played out that way had that actually occurred.
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:42:26
It's been a good news day: LN + Goldman Sachs.  That, and we just had a pretty good dip from ~17k to ~13.8 or so, right?  We're due a bounce.
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:02:33
That's really good, yes.
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:42:41
Can someone please explain to me what ethereum can do that bitcoin can't?  Like, what are its advantages *over* bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:21:12
You actually (hah) got me really good, people used to make fun of me in school by imitating me by saying "*Actually*..." while holding up one finger, because I was "that guy".
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:27:34
Dear god, this is *exactly* like how money worked back on the gold standard.
I'm not saying this is a bad thing, I'm saying it's fascinating that it has just naturally evolved this way...*again*.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:32:26
Never underestimate the willingness of people to speak confidently about that which they aren't qualified to.  Everyone is guilty of this to varying degrees.  Also, smart people, even *very* smart people, do and say dumb shit all the time.
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:06:07
How do you think ethereum's going to do?  It and bitcoin are the only two I'm willing to buy right now (and am currently holding both, though much more bitcoin).
@_date: 2018-09-04 20:46:23
I thought what he said about how the existing power structure was going to react to this was really interesting and something that's not talked about nearly enough.
@_date: 2018-09-04 19:37:58
As an American, to me, that means, unquestionably: "legal".
That's so foreign to me, the idea that something has to be expressly stated to be legal for it to *definitely* be legal: if it's not expressly *illegal*, then it is absolutely legal.
I don't need a law saying it's legal for me to hop around in my front yard in a purple bunny suit to know that it's legal, there's no law prohibiting that and so I'm absolutely certain that it is legal.

Just upvoted both of you for being two of the *very* few people in here actually contributing to the conversation and not just derping about.
@_date: 2018-05-14 16:46:24
Yes but it's all relative so as long as all our main competitors are doing the same (they are), we're good.
It's not *quite* that simple but as a gross generalization it's accurate.
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:48:32
I never liked this idea that being blunt about something and calling a spade a spade was somehow "unprofessional" or indicative that a business or person was unskilled or untrustworthy.  It's silly.
@_date: 2018-05-13 04:03:52
It's *still* a big deal though.
@_date: 2018-05-12 22:28:23
Yeah, I've really no problem with this.
@_date: 2018-05-14 16:56:59
That's a really good argument I hadn't thought of, thanks.
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:52:51
Their loss if they don't and said website turns out to have been right (*and* it's entirely *their* fault, not that of the website, that they didn't take the information seriously simply because of some silly superficial peeve they had).
@_date: 2018-05-03 04:01:16
After I learned that they would refer to themselves as having "gold man-sacks", I decided I liked them.
@_date: 2018-06-27 18:14:34
No one's thinking about the cause, not even people who are "thinking about the cause" are thinking about the cause, they're just currently supporting the cause because doing so aligns with their interests while saying that they support the cause because saying so also aligns with their interests as well (virtue signaling).  The second this changes, so will they.  Everyone is selfish, *everyone*.
@_date: 2018-06-07 23:59:25
And you can manually whitelist numbers.
And people could put together whitelists and blacklists and share them as is currently done with adblockers.

If you'd really like to delve into it:
@_date: 2018-06-27 18:05:01
I, too, think you were being a bit naive, however you're also being an awfully good sport, so have an upvote and cheers!
@_date: 2018-06-05 21:52:03
Nailed it.
I'd just like to throw out there, on a related note, I've seen quite a few idiots here saying, in one form or another whether explicitly or implicitly, that the adoption and use of bitcoin could somehow greatly increase without the price going up or, more commonly it seems (they say), while the price *goes down*.  If you think this you do not understand the basics of how price relates to supply and demand.  We know the supply, it's fixed to increase at a very specific, known, rate on top of what's already available, so if demand goes up beyond what the current supply can satisfy then so will the price.  There is precisely *zero* room for argument about this.

Why wouldn't he want the money in BTC?  Just curious.  Unless you need it *right now* instead of in 20 mins or an hour max or something, I don't see why you'd do that.  I'd be happy to take BTC.
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:18:14
No one's promoting crypto with fucking memes, GTFO with your stupidly obvious strawman.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:59:56
*Microsoft* is developing on Bitcoin?!  That's a big deal.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:36:18
And that's how the price of something like BTC ends up being whatever it is.
No, really, that's how it works.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:04:29
FWIW I'm fine with what you did (mainly because I completely understand the frustration of trying to make titles suit reddit's requirements), have an upvote.  People on reddit get so ridiculously anal about stuff like that, bunch of silly pseudointellectuals who want to show everyone how clever they think they are.
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:14:54


You just implied, quite clearly there, that a currency cannot be an investment, that those two things are mutually exclusive.  This is wrong.  You can invest in currencies and people do, and have done for a long time.  You can invest in dollars, euros, yen, etc.

What I was wondering as I was watching that was, how were those trousers modified for that routine?  They had to have been otherwise they wouldn't have survived the first split, I just wonder what they did.
