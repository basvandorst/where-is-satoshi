true :/ What would have been a better title?

This is exactly the point. Bitcoin can never compete with paypal on efficiency. Trustless transactions will always be more expensive than payment systems that require trust. Decentralization inefficiency is the price we pay for *monetary sovereignty*.

When txn volume and fee pressure become enough of a problem then SegWit will be activated to relieve that pressure short term. Bigger blocks need more more time for everyone to upgrade.

this depends on the definition of "*user*"
Only if you verify the blockchain yourself you can really be sure about your transactions without trusting a third party.
Of course you can also *use* bitcoin by delegating to full nodes, but since you trust third parties in this case it is technically not *trustless*.

self-organizing P2P network?

SegWit fixes lots of issues  and as a side effect increases the effective blocksize in a backwards compatible way, i.e. it can be rolled out faster and more secure 
Lightning Networks enable orders of magnitudes more txn throughput capacity, privacy and instant confirmation...  Lightning Networks can even span across multiple blockchains! Definitely exciting.

yes, that's why trustless money does not scale well. Giving up *trustlessness* would make bitcoin a very inefficient paypal though. It could never compete.

The discount aims to better align the costs for the network with the costs for txns. It encourages txns not to bloat the UTXO set.

is not so simple as it sounds. Since it's not backwards compatible everyone needs to upgrade, otherwise the network would split. This is much more controversial and needs even more time and careful planning to achieve.
