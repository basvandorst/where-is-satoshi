Transferring physical forms of Bitcoin (e.g. paper, coins, etc). makes me nervous. In the case of physical coins, how do you know that it contains the corresponding private key, and isn't a clever forgery?
Yes, FIAT can be forged too, but there are laws that make it illegal to do so, and the police can investigate and confiscate forgeries. Don't think that can happen with Bitcoins.
Not to mention, physical forms can be lost or stolen much more easily.

Don't know how 2fa works with coinbase, seems very dodgy you can bypass it with email. Email is not secure, and easy to reroute or intercept. Unless you encrypt the messages with GPG or similar, and hardly anybody does this. Wouldn't trust coinbase to store my funds if my email was the weakest link.

Are you talking about email or bitcoin here?

As far as I can tell, Blockchain still uses the old fee by default. Sure you can change it, but it doesn't really count as "other wallets which don't use the old fee amounts".
I thought BitcoinWallet also used the old fee, but I might be mistaken here. The author says "The app calculates the exact fee required" but not sure what this means. It won't let you change the value, and won't even print the value before making the transaction (not so good).
Can't comment on Electrum. Never used it. Appears to support BIP32 Deterministic wallets, so might be worth trying it out anyway.

Also see cryptolock. see: 
Sounds these rasomware can be pretty nasty.
It isn't bitcoin's fault though, it just happens to be the currency the attackers chose to receive the payment. Just as bitcoin can be used to purchase illegal drugs, it can also be used to pay ransoms. As well as many legal things.
Personally, I wouldn't trust the computer any more until it has had a complete reinstall of everything.

Looked at Overstock, saw "Buy now with Bitcoin" message on page for every item, tried to purchase, no option to pay in Bitcoin.
Turns out that they only support Bitcoin for USA customers (it doesn't say so on the website), and they said that they would remove the misleading message.
Almost a month latter, and the misleading message is still there, and still no indication it is for USA customers only.
Very unprofessional.

They don't appear to suport zero knowledge end-to-end encryption. Can't do that I think and support existing protocols like imap and pop at the same time.

1,000,000 bitcoins? Does that count as being a millionaire?
If not, 0 bitcoins + $1,000,000 FIAT.
If that costs too much, try Zimbabwean dollars.
Try not to spend it until 2024.

GreenAddress.it says it charges 0.1mBTC/kb, with no option to change it, so it seems it is just as bad.
Looks like the default for Blockchain is 0.1mBTC, but is possible to override this.
If 0.01mBTC is the "new fee", is it going to be adopted by the miners?

Has any of this been officially confirmed by the Bitcoin CEO? Otherwise, I think it is just FUD. If he really did get stuck in a parallel universe, he wouldn't have able able to post this message here in this universe.
I think if Bitcoin did have such a serious limitation, a time traveller from the future would have alerted Satoshi Nakamoto to fix the problem before he even introduced it.

That would mean you end up having big central organisations, like coin base, and won't be able to buy a drink unless you have an account with the same organisation as the merchant. Which defeats the whole point of bitcoin.

Depending on where you live, storing paper wallets safely, especially long term, can be deceptively difficult. When you need to access a paper wallet, can you remember where you left it X years ago? Maybe you can, but it was damaged by water condensation. Or bookworks ate it.  Or maybe the ink used didn't last as long as you expected. Or the paper has disintegrated. Or maybe it was hidden in the couch, and family donate the couch.

How do you know the QR code displayed on the computer was the correct QR code? If the computer was compromised, it could be displaying the wrong QR code, and you just sent your funds to the wrong address.

PayPal support would greatly increase exposure of Bitcoin to the average person, and would allow people to earn Bitcoin (e.g. by selling on Ebay) without converting from FIAT.  On the other hand, PayPal has a poor reputation for doing the right thing, and I am sure they could mess this up, and people are likely to get a bad first impression of Bitcoin.

Not sure how much I would trust OpenSSL. Have heard, from people I trust, that the coding standards are awful, making code reviews difficult. 
The Debian flaw you mention is a good example, he asked on the upstream mailing list before making the change, and was basically told to go ahead. "If it helps with debugging, I'm in favor of removing them." "There's your first clue, build with -DPURIFY", etc. Not even the people on the upstream mailing list understood the implications of making the change.
See entire thread starting with 
There have been a long list of security vulnerabilities found in openssl. See  . There are several independent projects announced to clean up the code (e.g. libreSSL). Not to mentioned the well publicised heartbleed bug, however this was just one security issue in a list of many.

Poor reason, there are Bitcoin escrow services available, including 2of3 multisig, and I suspect the good ones will offer a better and fairer service then what PayPal provides.

...but the slot is the wrong size!
Would hazard a guess that the guy didn't even realize it wasn't a conventional ATM, and wanted to withdraw money from his ATM card in FIAT. Wonder how often this happens.
Conventional ATMs often have large lights on the slot to direct users where to put the card. At least in Australia. Possibly something that the Robocoin ATM could do to.
Not sure I would trust an unknown branded ATM machine just because it looks like an ATM machine, who knows who put it there and for what purpose, but I guess that is just me.

I see this 51% attack thing as a distraction from the real problem.
The real problem is that whenever somebody new wants to start mining, they are persuaded not to - it will cost you too much, I don't want to lose my current mining profits, etc. Many people recommend mining altcoins instead.
So the big mining pools survive, and Bitcoin becomes less distributed and more centrally controlled as a result.
I think having too few people control the mining infrastructure, could mean that they could collude and increase the minimum required mining fees, for example. 
Hardly a 51% attack, but not in Bitcoin's best interests, either.
Yes, mining is only one part, however running a full node is also expensive, depending on your network connection, bandwidth limits, etc.
The way I see it, if we want to keep bitcoin being a distributed system, as it should be, some changes are required.

I went back to the machine. You can't see all the labels when standing next to the machine, because the labels are under the Protrusions. If you walk several metres away from the machine, the labels are obvious.
I really think they haven't considered usability issues, seems like it was something developed by technical people with no thought to the end user's experience.

The weak points with your security, I believe are:
* Copying the keys to Mega. Mega might be secure (lets assume it is), but what about the computer you used to make the backup? Oh wait, scratch that, the wallet copied to Mega was already encrypted
* Your phone. Has it ever been left unattended? Is it possible that somebody might has physical access without you knowing? They could have conducted a backup without you knowing (presumably this also means writing down the key that is displayed)? Check your sent emails, sent SMS, etc. Seems a bit odd that they wouldn't just send themselves the funds on the spot, but maybe attacker didn't have their public key available. Or they wanted to hide the time of theft.
* If you paid for anything with your phone, somebody might have observed you, and found out about your funds this way. I think I read that you didn't have a PIN, but even if you did, would be very easy for someone to observe you enter it.
* The encryption key for the backups. How did you store that? Did you store this on Mega? On your computer? On the sdcard of your phone?
* The backup themselves? Where did you store them? What was entire process of getting these from the phone to Mega? Did you use email?
* I assume you used the official version of Mycelium from the Google Play store, right?
I think these points may have already been ruled out elsewhere in this thread, but just in case, have listed them here. I am more inclined to go with the simplest explanations. Rather then what-if-there-was-a-backdoor-in-mega-and-they-managed-to-hack-the-security-camera-and-read-the-encryption-key type thing.
If somebody was able to get both the backups and the encryption key anywhere along the path, consider the money gone.
It is worth noting that on Android, applications cannot access other applications data (not counting "external" sdcard data), unless the application was signed with the same key, or this was on a rooted phone and the app was given root access. Or if there is a security flaw on the OS (as has happened by various Android vendors from time to time).

On receipt of anything that looks like remotely like a recall email, and appears to be sent from the same person (or some other authorised person), you are suppose to immediately delete the original email and the recalled email, and definitely not publish it in a public forum.

Here is the last transaction I made from CoinJar:
It was made 2015-02-11. It sure looks like a mining fee of 0.0001 BTC to me. Did I get this wrong?
Are we talking about the same Coinjar? 
I am not aware of any others.
