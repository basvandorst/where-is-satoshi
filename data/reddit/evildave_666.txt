Simple math:
Calculate the marginal revenue of adding a single GPU to a network with 1/3 of the hashrate of current (and this represents a theoretical best-case, no chinese asics being moved overseas and little additional hashrate being added, which isn't going to happen). This results in a marginal daily revenue of less than 2 US cents per GPU (I'm using a GTX-1080 as an example). Then subtract the cost of operation (electricity and hardware depreciation). The net result is going to be negative.

Yeah but by that point the average uxto is likely to be much smaller and the average tx might not be 1 input, 2 output and consolidation txs also going to be expensive even at 1s/byte.

@_date: 2019-07-10 23:59:44
Reading between-the-lines a little but I think the OP's concern is the cost of even 1s/byte transactions if the fiat exchange rate ever reaches astronomic levels which is kind of a different issue than blocks being full.

Except that this is an entirely unsupported statement. No one on the thread that said they got fiat out on the 25th didn't already have a request queued. One person stated they got 1500 yen in excess of what they had pending but even that person had already initiated a withdrawal in advance.
I myself on the 25th got exactly the amount I queued on the 20th. The remainder was still in my account the last time I accessed it at 10:30am (when I noticed that the withdrawal status had changed to processed from confirmed).

Its also not true. They processed a LOT of JPY withdrawls on 25 Feb but not the whole queue, seems to have been done in order of size of the withdrawl. People with high-6-figure/7-figure pending did not get processed while those with lesser amounts did (my own 5-figure withdrawl scheduled only the week before got processed, I'm aware of people with 7-figures pending from early january that didn't.)
I also initially thought the whole queue was cleared but quickly found people with large withdrawls that hadn't been processed on the Tokyo Bitcoin facebook group.

The point I was making was that there wasn't obvious preferential treatment going on. Many people with JPY holdings got paid out in the final days, not just a select few (and absolutely no reason for my being put into that group).
Its my view that it was mitigation to civil lawsuits, not governmental pressure drove that. Those of us who did try to involve the FSA got told that they had no regulatory authority over Gox.     
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:46:23

You'd have to do the math for that, but the data is all available (it helps if you can read a Japanese balance sheet though, they're organized a bit different than western ones).
Just need to reckon the numbers between the updated list of claims and the balance sheet.
@_date: 2017-03-10 01:08:52

@_date: 2017-03-10 10:08:54
Likely in excess of 90% of total claim value were erroneously entered. Its been a while since I looked at the documents.
If you look at the top 50 rejected claims and cross check them with the balances in the leaked database there are a number off by exact ratios of satoshis/btc or by exchange rates on the conversion date, suggesting some were also entered in the wrong currency. 
Its pretty evident that the carelessness of some people in filling out the forms is going to cost them huge sums of money.

An important consideration - if your wallet is lithium ion powered, store it at about 40% charge for the least long-term battery capacity degradation. If you come back years later to a non functional battery (eg won't charge) that's difficult to locate a replacement for it will be a pain. (You'll have to restore to another device from recovery phrase which kind of defeats the purpose of keeping the thing in storage)

This is essentially correct, however permanently unretrievable coins raise the value of the remaining coins.
In theory this is not worrisome.

As I said, there are optimizations that could be made in a lightning wallet to improve things, like an internal barcode reader that automatically activates when the gyroscope detects a totally flat or vertical device orientation and biometric confirmation that can reduce payment steps to make it come in similar, but to date no one has implemented them. As it stands, EXISTING NFC implementations have any current lightning ones beat hands-down.
@_date: 2019-10-16 11:53:32
NFC-F cards have an on onboard secure element which can give you a fully encrypted chain of trust. Sony has some decent info out there on it. They're generally used for prepaid applications in Japan though. There is a fundamental difference for what Asian countries and western ones want to use NFC for. Western countries generally focus on replacing your credit card while in Asia it replaces a pocket full of change (a perfect application for vending).

You're likely going to get downvoted to hell for saying that but you're right. That whole interaction would have taken less than 3 seconds via NFC. (Select item, tap card, vend)
Granted there are ways you could optimize a lightning wallet for microtransactions to cut down on the number of interactions with the UI but no one has really thought much about them and that's a big hurdle.
@_date: 2019-06-30 11:43:56
You lock up some coin on the regular network, creating a channel into the lightning network. Once your channel is created the network maintains its own list of IOUs representing lightning transactions you participate in outside the blockchain. When you want regular coins to spend you close your channel at which point the IOUs are settled and you receive coin back as a regular blockchain transaction.
There are of course a lot more details and caveats, but once your channels are open, transacting is fast and cheap.

If a miner is lucky enough to succeed in mining a block before the previous block is fully validated (a short but actual window) its actually impossible to include any transactions aside from the coinbase in that block.

Because these miners begin mining the next block as soon as they have the block header (i.e. before they have all information of what's in the most recent block).  They only require the first 80 bytes of the block to start mining coinbase-only blocks and can then switch to full blocks once they have received and validated the whole block. Its only new blocks that are solved in this window of the remainder of the block being received plus the validation time that we're talking about.

There's several things to consider.
A rational seller (who wanted to extract the maximum possible value) of a million coins would sell OTC, which would not affect the price nearly as much as you'd expect. (See what the market did around the time of the silk road coin sale as an example)
A market sell order at many exchanges simultaneously could be calculated. Sum the trade books of the exchanges covering say, 95% of the global trade volume and see how deeply a million coins would eat into the buys. You could recalculate this for whatever combination of currency pairs you want since trading across multiple pairs would mitigate the immediate impact of a market sell.
The other thing, which I have no idea how to analyze is psychological impact. The addresses believed to contain Satoshi's coins (some with higher confidence than others) are pretty widely monitored. Any sign of them moving and the news would spread instantly.
Personally though, I believe that Satoshi's coins are beyond access (either via Satoshi no longer being with us, wallet data loss, or password loss) at this point.

You're off by units, and things can't cost fractional satoshi.
Also consider what happens with fees without a divisibility change... A relatively average 20 satoshi/byte transaction would cost at minimum $44.80 (a 1-input, 1 output non-segwit transaction for simplicity) with BTCUSD=X at 1000000.

Some miner mined a block but put no transactions into it except the coinbase (generation of the 12.5 new coins).  This happens from time to time due to miner profit optimization and the block is both legitimate and reasonable (a miner can start working on the next block as soon as the first 80 bytes of the current one is downloaded but pays the penalty of foregoing transaction fees if he solves the block before the download is finished and validated - in the linked case the block in question was solved some seconds after the previous one).

I have no real interest in the matter, just playing devils advocate, I was able to cash out via domestic withdrawl on Feb 25, only BTC dust and pocket change in JPY left.
I put in a claim anyhow for fiat payout, just to force the paperwork to get done.
I do have issues with forcing Kraken accounts for BTC payout (why should people have to register with a foreign entity with regards to a domestic claim?)

Miners are free to mine whatever they want as long as they output protocol-compliant blocks. You may not like it but it's cold hard fact.

Unless the amount of Bitcoin is significant or you plan on continuing to transact in the Bitcoin economy, do option B. The one-time cost of setting up accounts and passing kyc requirements is likely to cost more of your time than the Bitcoin will cash out at.

The US has basically threatened all overseas financial organizations to provide information on all US-person customers or forfeit 30% of all USD transactions (be they US-person related or not).
This is actually incompatible with bank secrecy laws in many countries so some banks cannot comply with FATCA _and_ local regulatory requirements simultaneously.
The natural consequence of this is banks refusing to do business with US customers any more.

It was claim number B201104 and its a data entry error. The user entered his balance as satoshis instead of BTC so it was off by 8 orders of magnitude.
There were many claims that were off by 8 (satoshi/btc) or 3 (mbtc/btc) orders of magnitude. You'd think that with so much money at stake people would take more care.
