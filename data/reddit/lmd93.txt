We were talking about Vitalik's words. He very clearly stated "simple possession". Do you understand that "simple possession" specifically excludes intent? You are attacking a completely different thing. And no, the law does not always take intent into consideration. That is why there is a distinction between simple and compund possession. Vitalik is talking about the former and you're talking about the latter.

Moving the market requires purchasing. But suppose we drop the actus reus and define demand merely as the intent to purchase more. This still has nothing to do with what Vitalik wrote.
Vitalik wrote "simple possession", meaning strict liability and no intent. The term "compund possession" implies intent. I'm sure you've heard "possession with intent to distribute" or "possession for personal use". Those are examples of compound possession.
To find someone guilty of creating a market for CP it is necessary to show intent, and this isn't the kind of possession Vitalik referenced. He referenced simple possession, meaning someone can be "guilty" without even knowing that CP exists. If someone doesn't know CP exists, how can they demand more of it?

All possession laws are idiotic. They are strict liability meaning you don't even need to know that you are in possession to be penalized. There is no mens rea. It's the perfect tool for authoritarian control. This isn't about making CP, which is evil. This is about "possession". If you haven't studied possession laws on weapons, drugs, and many other inanimate objects then you really aren't qaulified to comment. Possessing CP is bad. But that doesn't mean policing possession of it is good.

Yea. You gotta reset your tax basis for a non like kind exchange. So if you buy x for 100 z and trade it for y when x is worth 200 z then you gotta pay the z master for your gains on x and then start a new tax basis on y for the 200 z that y is worth. Then when you trade away your y when it's worth 500 z you gotta pay the z master tax on 300 z because y went from 200 z to 500 z. You gotta pay z master even if you never trade for z. All people in the z kingdom must pay.

BCH is easy. There's an electrum version for it. Electron Cash. You can verify it against the same version of vanilla electrum by diffing. They only changed a few lines to make it work with BCH. Once you've verified you have honest code you can import your seed or keys like you would do using Electrum. Then whatever happens in one chain won't show up in the other. Use Electron Cash for BCH and Electrum for BTC. You can use a service like shapeshift to buy BTC with BCH or BCH with BTC. Use Electron Cash to pay Shapeshift and have them pay your Electrum.
But don't do it. Just hold. No one knows which fork will win. Relax and quit buying into the hype here. They're saying you should just chill out and accept the dip and that BTC will rise again. I have no doubt the bitcoin lineage will succeed, but I don't know whether it will be BCH or BTC. Perhaps it will be both. If you hold both then you get to choose where you retire or who you pay tax to. What if BCH turns out to be China coin? So what? You can now be a rich globalist scum you lucky bastard.

Then punish the act. Criminalization actually makes it harder to find the actors. I once found a bunch of CP on my computer after subscribing to some old Usenet groups for some nostaliga. I picked the ones I used to read and went to sleep. In the morning I found that Thunderbird had downloaded tonnes of CP. The groups had become rogue and, unlike in the old days where I needed to manually uudecode and zmodem downlaod binary files, Thunderbird had done it all automatically. What do you think I did next? Call the police and tell them that I had evidence of children being exploited? Of course not. I deleted that crap and uninstalled Thunderbird as fast as I could. I'm not going to become a person of interest for a ten year prison term. No fucking way. Of course they can use the prison term to twist someone's arm, but that comes at the expense of people destroying evidence (of other people's crimes), destroying purchase records, etc.

You're arguing for a conviction based on pre-crime. If you can prove a purchase WAS made then that's different a different scenario. But you've argued that someone's access to and control over CP implies future demand. Another poster pointer out that in CA you must have knowledge of possession, yet many "knowingly possess" scenarios exist that would not create future demand. There are gradations of guilt... no knowledge of access, knowledge of access, intent to use, preparation to use, attempt at use. "Simple possession" only covers the first two cases. You cannot use arguments about intent and higher to attack Vitalik's assertions. No matter how much you want to talk about the market, demand, intent, or use, Vitalik's point will stand because he did not cover those cases.

I'm with you on the ideology. But I now think Bitcoin has solved the scaling debate since the Genesis block. You are witnessing it in this fork. Two chains have twice the capacity. You are also witnessing a kind of Darwinism. No one knows which organisms will survive because no one knows how their fitness will be ultimately judged. Centralization is a weakness, but not now. In the future a new fork may emerge and the market will price it according to its value. I held both coins because I've set up my cold storage to be a bit annoying to unlock and trade. I'm now more convinced that this is the best way to hold. Don't try to profit off every fork that might die as it starts. Some of them might make it. BCH may or may not. It's too early to tell.

@_date: 2017-11-14 06:11:08
That's the paradigm that's taken hold, yes. But it wasn't always this way.
The two components of guilt are actus reus and mens rea. Possession is different because it is a status crime, like the deprecated vagrancy. If your status is such that you have access to and can exert control over an object then you are in possession. No act nor guilty conscience must be proved. This makes the burden of proof exceedingly difficult. A person isn't found guilty. His guilt his decided by the facts alone. Our constitutionally enshrined rights include the right to a trial by jury, but this is unecessary in the current legal paradigm of policing possessions. Most cases are plea bargained, which makes sense since the burden of proof has all but been eliminated.
Our system of criminal justuice was not origionally designed for policing possessions so our 6th amendment right to a jury trial has become an anachrism.
Possession laws have also desroyed the 4th amendment regarding search and seizure through bootstrapping. The more things that are banned, the more reason there is to search, and the more likely it is to uncover something.
BTW, there is a time and a place for erring on the side of caution. Prison rules contain long lists of contraband. Outside of prison, are we free people or not?

You'll see the return of true kings. Kings are nothing more than the highest settler and arbitrator. As we return to individual soveregnty I'd expect our political and economic activity to self organize as Dante Alighieri describes in Principea De Monarchia. Basically, neigbors need a trusted third party to settle and arbitrate. You choose an arbitrator the same reason you buy insurance... to trade chance of loss with magnitude of loss. So a local prince is made and then these principalities quarrel and so on to the king. And all the guys at the bottom want the king to be their arbitrator too, since he can really whack your neigbor. You see where this is going.

If you don't do anything you will have both. If you want to see spendable BCH just use a BCH wallet you trust to import your keys. Make sure you can trust this wallet, however. If you want to be really safe you can spend your BTC to a new set of keys. Your BCH will remain at the old set. That way you avoid the possibilty that an unscrupulous BCH wallet will steal your keys and take both your BTC and BCH. This can happen with a BTC wallet too, but since you're already using Electrum for BTC you've already had some verification that your installation is safe.

Actually I think you can influence the market simply by thinking. Your thoughts are like a green or red marble pulled out of an opaque bag... will the price go up or down. Pulling a marble out of a bag is a common example to show how Bayesian probability works. So before you thought about Bitcoin the market had a prior probability. After you thought about it this revealed a single data point of pessisim/optimism, your own, but still a data point that will affect the probability of what the market will do.

Bitaddress.org. It's a single html file with embedded JavaScript. Diff the html file at bitaddress.org with one you get from github so you know you have a legit copy. Then put this file on a flash drive and move it to an offline computer. Then load that html in a browser and generate some paper wallets. Select BIP38 encryption in the options. Print wallets to pdf. Check that you can decrypt your wallets using the wallet info tab. If you print these be sure and tear off the public key hash after you make a deposit. It's stupid to deposit twice and it's also stupid to leak how much bitcoin you have, which that pesky public key does well. If you keep it electronic then encrypt the pdf with gpg. I lost a memory stick with wallets on it. Coins are safe thanks to BIP38 but I had to move all my coins to get them a step away from other identifying info I had on that stick. Best if people see a balance of zero. There's a lot of talk about protecting your private keys. True, but you need to protect your public ones too. Keep that in mind as you make your paper wallets.

Tax will have to evolve as you describe for an additional very powerful reason: personal safety. Bitcoin isn't an FDIC insured balance in someone else's computer. Bitcoin is hidden gold. It must stay hidden. Any person known to have bitcoin is at risk for kidnapping and burglary. If you must keep it secret for your own health then you cannot possibly account for tax paid on it with employees of government. The crooked FBI agent in the Silk Road case is not the exception. Be a good guy and pay tax on your BCH-&gt;BTC trade? You just put a target on your back for any lowlife in government or finance who might ever see that information. No thanks.

I get my cash by withdrawing $1k at a time from ATMs. Usually I can see the need for a large wad of cash in advance so this is no problem. I don't really want to join a nationwide bank as I'm pretty happy with my CU. Cash has a purpose. We should not be prohibited from using it. The government should not be placing a cooling effect on using it. They are though. Also, one of the things that blew the mind of an escaped N. Korean prisoner was him seeing cash exchanges for food. He'd never seen private ownership or peaceful commerce. Can't find the link... maybe someone else can. Point is: We aren't a free people any more. Simple as that.

Right, but we need to fix the privacy hole in paying tax where certain transactions (e.g. BCH -&gt; BTC) essentially reveals to total strangers how much bitcoin someone owns. Bitcoin isn't an FDIC insured account or gold in someone else's safe. It's in the owners house, in his mind, and near his family. Privacy concerns are therefore security concerns. This sub cannot advise people to keep their amount secret while simultaneously telling them to reveal to the government how much they own. The government are a group of total strangers loaded with sociopaths and thieves. For everyone's personal safety, these are the last people who should know how much bitcoin everyone is hiding. Yes, hiding. Hiding it is fundamental to personal safety.

So. I didn't originally buy in 2011 to become rich. I bought because I was terrified of the 1 in 1000 chance that bitcoin would take off. I bought just enough so that if it did, I wouldn't have to live on the street or fight in another man's army. Now of course I wish I had bought more as I'm still not a millionaire. In 2017 it's looking like more of a 1 in 10 chance and I'm glad as hell I insured my finances with bitcoin as I did. Anyone with a full time job who doesn't own at least 0.1 bitcoin or so is taking a big risk. It's perfectly sane to be scared of bitcoin, and buying it is the only protection. Because of this, it will win.

Break up your holdings into several wallets so you never risk all at once. Do this with seed words too. And protect your public key as much as you do your private one. BIP38 keeps your bitcoins safe, but if someone can associate you with a large some of coins then you aren't safe. Paper wallets need to have the public key hash burned off after they're funded imho.

But, no... we're just fine putting our name in everyone's database alongside that public key hash. That's fine... It's the gold under your bed, in your closest, in your head.

Because 21e6 / 7e9 is 0.003 BTC per person globally. This is 33 times that amount. Because it's currently a day's wages (give or take) for a skilled tradesmen or professional with experience. It's a small amount now and won't be a huge amount when bitcoin takes over. It will be enough to maneuver when the time comes. For a family you'd probably want more. Of course this is all relative. If you are in a part of the world where median monthly income is currently $500 then you'd probably get by on less. I'm not thinking about getting rich. This is more about security and preserving one's standard of living. In the end 0.1 will be way more than enough, but you need to make it to the end too.

Our "identity" is the only thing we still "own". I mean, not really own since an SSN is still big brother's number. But we own it much more than anything else since all modern ownership is public and attached to an identity. I don't have to worry much about a robber stealing my FDIC account... unless he has my identity data.
Owning bitcoin and gold and cash under the mattress is different. We truly own it. To steal it, someone must actually steal it. There is no central weak system holding a giant bounty to hack. It's an inherently more secure system.
But I can see it now. Bitcoin, the true solution to the ludicrous fallout of paying for things with our identity, will be attacked as the culprit of all this. It's not. The problem is that US citizens have been basically stripped of all property except for a number given to them by the elite.

BCH has replay protection against 2x. BTC doesn't. Just think about that. You never know. In a 2x disaster scenario you could see BTC drop 50% while BCH only drops 10% or so. Even with most of the hash power at 2x, if it becomes a PayPal (or even smells that way) then people will jump into alts... and hash power will follow.

Oh man. A bitcoin is divisible into 8 decimals. Eight zeros = 000 000 00. First 3 is mBTC. Next three is bits. Last two are satoshis.
So there are 100 satoshis in a bit and 1000 bits in an mbtc.
Satoshis are cents. Bits are 1 bit bills. mbtc are 1000 bit bills. And a full bitcoin is a 1 million bit bill where each bit is further divisible into 100 satoshis. Its a lot like dollars and cents.

Multiple layers is good though. Even with a VPN you can leak your username to a chrome login or make some other mistake. For security (personal safety) it's actually more important to change usernames every few weeks than passwords since the former isn't protected by default.
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:26:58
Yes. Print several paper wallets and try out a small amount on some of them. Another trick you should be aware of is BIP38 encryption. This will encrypt your private key with a passphrase. Once you have funded the wallet you no longer need the public key hash. For additional safety you can tear off the public key after you have funded the wallet. That way no one can check the balance of the wallet without decrypting the private key. They wont even know the wallet has been funded. This keeps you safe from wrench attacks and you can still recover your coins from just the encrypted private key and your password.
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:05:53
Encrypt the seed and email it to yourself as something mundane like "proposal" or "todo" or "file list". Put the password in a photo album.

I think you have it wrong. People want it because other people want it. It's turtles all the way down. This doesn't mean it will fall apart. Quite the contrary, as there is no underlying asset to devalue. Holding means you want it. That's all it takes.

I'd say 50% within this lifetime or else 0%. I think it needs to be in one lifetime too, and Satoshi nailed the halving schedule. Bitcoin doesn't make a very good oddball heirloom, especially with the expertise (or ecosystem) it takes to properly secure it and to keep developers on the project. It will need to quickly become the mainstream medium of exchange or it will fail.

You don't need to use an exchange to transfer it. Tax law would still require you to spill the beans if BCH and BTC aren't like-kind, a nice legal torpedo. BTW, the government forcing exchanges to collect identification info is a direct assault on everyone's safety. Can you imagine bending a link off your gold chain to pay someone and then, just to comply with the regs, giving that person your home address while also shouting "my chain now has 31 links remaining". It's absolutely insane. We have been so sheltered from ownership we have lost all common sense. We should all be tumbling and shapeshifting to protect ourselves from criminals.

I'm equally afraid of hardware. The only solution is to split up your BTC into amounts that you can replace. Suck to to lose $1k. Fees suck. But it's better than losing $100k. I'd never want to be in a situation where I have a single seed holding all my coins and I must now type that seed into a brand new wallet. Fuck that. I'd rather have many seeds or many paper wallets. Put $1k on there for a while and spend some. Let the wallet earn my trust over time. Let a thief sit on their temptation for a while if I'm being watched. Let them consider risk/reward of sweeping now vs. waiting for a higher balance to sweep. Once the wallet has earned my trust I may begin to use it with larger sums, but those will never be more than 10% of my holdings.

The dollar is backed by a kick in the nuts. To elaborate, there's both positive and negative reinforcement, and you can back a currency with either. The dollar is based on an obligation aka debt. Owning it doesn't mean you can trade it in for a cupcake, it means that if you can't use it to buy a cupcake then someone is getting kicked in the nuts.

DO NOT TELL PEOPLE YOU HAVE BITCOIN.
This goes double for strangers. Government agents are strangers. Not only are you telling strangers how much you have, you're giving them your address and providing lots of additinal information that could be used as leverage in negotiations against you.
Bitcoin is not a parcel of land. It's not a social security check or an IRA. It's not an FDIC insured account or a trading account. These things must be tied to your identity. Bitcoin is more like a treasure map or a bar of gold. If the authorities disagree that you own a parcel of land then you don't own that land. Ditto for bank accounts and entitlements. Bitcoin is different. You own it. You own it outright and it can be stolen or coherced from you in ways that other property cannot. In a way it's like cash under your mattress. It invites personal harm when the wrong people know about it.
Like it or not, when you own bitcoin you are sovereign. Your own safety and the safety of your loved ones depends on you behaving as a sovereign. As a sovereign you may choose to pay taxes on your inter-crypto trades. Just know what you're doing and be wise to the risk and reward.

You only need the private key to access funds. You send funds to a public key hash. The public key hash can be derived from the private key. You can use any wallet that can sweep or import a private key. Many do it. You can also use the bitaddress.org software (html page) to decrypt a bip38 key and then import/sweep that in case a particular wallet doesn't support bip38.
