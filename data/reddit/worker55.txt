Mining is really difficult right now. You essentially need to either buy a pre-made (expensive) ASIC miner to do the mining, or buy ASIC chips and solder them onto circuit boards. If you can't afford the pre-made or don't know how to solder, then forget about mining btc.

First off, thanks for taking the time to respond to my post. Second, while I do hate paper wallets, please keep in mind that I do understand that some people are very happy with them.
1. Inheritance: I don't use paper wallets, and I have an inheritance plan. I set it up in a way that is 100 times easier than paper wallets. Here is how you do it: give a lawyer your laptop with your wallet all set up and ready to go. Then put your password in a safety deposite box. Then the people who get your stuff when you die simply have to get the laptop and put in the password. No scanning. No raw keys. No worries about people stealing anything.
2. Longevity. How do I plan to keep my digital info secure for 20 years? If I have my encrypted wallet stored on several mediums, then it will be retrievable in 20 years. I don't see the problem here. Also, all the examples you gave about bit rot involve tech that was known to not be future proof.
What do you think about my points on redundancy and risk exposure?

I would never recommend encrypted paper wallets to anyone. While they would be harder to steal than unencrypted paper wallets, they would also be harder to manage. In addition to keeping track of three copies of your really long password, you also need to keep track of all your paper wallets that you need to create. But it doesn't stop there, as soon as you need to spend the coins, you need to import the keys and do the whole process all over again. If you need to have a paper filing system to manage your bitcoins, you are doing it wrong.

This isn't financial advice, but one thing some people do is stick to a cost averaging plan. That way, they'll be doing a strategy that allows them to hate themselves the least. So, if a person wants to invest 1000, they split that 1000 into chunks of 50 and invest every other day for 20 days.

I'm not so sure. If someone takes my paper wallet, they have my coins. Game over. If someone happens upon one of my really long passwords, they still have quite a bit of work to do in order to get at my coins (break into my home, break into my computer, etc).
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:35:00
How are my views either liberal or unamerican? If you go to court hungover, they'll give you plenty of time locked up to try and remember the password.

I gave my dad 2 bitcoins for fathers day a couple years ago. I think he thought it was cool because it was something that he knew I was excited about. I think part of gifting is the approach. You need to be humble about it. If you make crazy promises, you look a little crazy. It works better if you mention how much they are worth at the time of giving, and then mention that they are something that you put lots of free time into because they are really fun for you. Giving a gift that is really important to you is more important than the probably small value of the gift. You might get a polite smile now, but that smile will shine in the coming years if btc goes up in value.

For what it's worth, I would not recommend putting your money in a paper wallet. Paper wallets are easy to do incorrectly, and they can be lost, burnt, stolen, etc. Also, the more backups you make of your paper wallet, the easier they are to steal.
Just put your money in a normal bitcoin-qt wallet or the armory wallet. Use the built-in encryption option to put a really strong password on your wallet (12 -16 words with numbers and letters. Write the password down. Hide it in a few different places). Finally, make a copy of the wallet file, encrypt the copy, and use that as a backup (put it on a disk. give it to a friend. etc).
All these people with the paper wallets, I will never understand them.
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:41:29
The problem is that paper wallets are really vulnerable. If you have your private keys laying in a lockbox somewhere, someone that broke in could simply scan them. You would need to put a password on the paper wallets. Is that implemented yet?

I don't know why you are getting downvotes. It's a legitimate point to raise. If a car dealership or whatever gets the btc, then converts to cash, the market will be affected. As the price increases, this could cause a flashcrash as early adopters unload their massive profits. The counter argument, of course, is twofold:
1. The easy btc -&gt; usd conversion is a feature of the currency, not a bug. It proves that friction is low in bitcoin land.
2. A flash-crash could be an issue at that point in time, but the end result -- the environment just after the flashcrash -- is a more stable bitcoin economy. The money is more spread out. The resulting media shitstorm will only create publicity for cheap coins. Therefore, the next rise in bitcoin will be on more stable footing.

How are you at risk if someone breaks into your computer? Key loggers? If you are able to jump through the paper wallet hoops to avoid key loggers, then you are able to avoid key loggers with or without paper wallets.
For the backups I'm assuming that you would backup the paper wallet by making extra copies.

Folks are expecting big returns on their risky investment. What's the big deal? In the real world, most people who know about bitcoin are leery of it, and most of the people in the world don't know about bitcoin.

Taking paper wallets to their absurd conclusion ...
@_date: 2013-11-26 08:11:12
Yup, I was just commenting over in ecigs to a merchant that the price is weirdly high right now. The folks who are buying in right now are taking a much bigger risk than I did when I bough way back when. That being said, back at 350 a fellow redditor and a I were predicting a decline, but we were proven totally wrong.
As for your point on *need*, I feel that there are tons of untapped *industries* that are currently not taking advantage of bitcoin. International transfers, travel, not to mention the contracts and colored coin projects which would impact the securities market. Those industries need bitcoin because bitcoin does it way better than the legacy banking infrastructure.
As for the USD -&gt; Bitcoin conversion friction, I believe that it is an issue, but I don't really care about it. I think it is good in a perverted way. It filters out many people that don't have the tech chops to handle cryptocurrencies (like the folks with 8 different search engine bars installed on their browser).
As for the speculating newbies hoping to strike it rich, I hope they don't put too much money down all at once. If they do, then it's on them. I have told others that some people cost average their investments. That is probably a good model if I were to try to enter the market at this point. That being said, I regret not really stocking up back when I first entered (at $1). Then again, it was *really* hard/weird to get coins back then. I sent cash in the mail!
Also, why are you repping mastercoin? LOL

I think that part of the issue here is that over the years each of the peaks have been totally unfathomable in and of themselves. Yet everyone knows that if this thing works out, those peaks mean nothing. And we've seen that time and time again. So, what makes this time any different? Nothing really, besides the Senate hearings, and the China thing, and the ATMs, and the rise and fall of Silk Road, and perceptible shift in public dialogue. and everything else. That coupled with the orders-of-magnitude ROIs, it's easy to understand why people are excited. And they all know we are in some kind of bubble, but we all think this bubble will be just like the ones before.

Agreed. I think the electrum route is probably a good one to go down. But I see using electrum's passphrase system is much different than transferring you private keys to a piece of paper.
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:18:40


This is not the best way to store your coins. The best way to store them is to encrypt your wallet with a strong password (12 *random* words: 8 real words, four made-up words with bonus points for capitalization and punctuation marks), write the password down on three different pieces of paper, keep the password copies in three different places (in case of fire), and then back up that wallet onto three different mediums (a CD, on a computer, and perhaps in the cloud, but the cloud does have privacy implications).
You shouldn't need to worry about keypairs and whatnot. If you do a few transactions from the wallet, then you should probably perform another backup.
Also, there is a comment here on using electrum's 12 word seed. That is another option worthy of consideration.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:31:56
I really recommend googling that question to get a full answer, but here is my understanding:
1. In bitcoin-qt, you should backup your wallet once every 50 transactions or so (but there is some wiggle room there). Bitcoin-qt auto-generates 100 keys. When you do your backup, you are backing up those 100 keys. Think of each transaction as using up a key.
2. Other wallets (like electrum) can use a special process that involves a seed from which all new transactions can "grow" out of. This means you do your backups once and then you can do an unlimited number of transactions (but *please* read their documentation on this and seek clarification from others before proceeding. I don't happen to use electrum).

I've been recommending campbx for purchasing, but coinbase is probably fine. I would also say that you should probably spend some time reading up before transferring anything. Get to know armory and try transferring over $20USD in bitcoin first to get a feel for it.
Also, I only have a small stash of coins, but I still use a dedicated computer running linux to do my wallet stuff.
