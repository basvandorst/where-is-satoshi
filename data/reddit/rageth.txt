Arh I have no skills of that type at all! was hoping (dreaming) for some off the shelf type program. I'd like to play with what I have and hopefully build up to buy a decent miner rig.

That's the problem, catching the small ups and downs. That will all add eventually. All I can do atm is catch the big trends which is what is what anyone can do. But yeah the data part is the important bit. I sit looking at live streak graphs when I get free time. But it's still so volatile. So really I'd want fast small exchanges that are calculated with data accumulated. I can't see it going back under 100usd for the immediate future though.

Yeah good points,Thanks. I use bitstamp atm. It's slightly behind Mt's prices sometimes. So I can jump on a hike if I'm quick about it. I can set some to buy/sell at a certain price. But that is only one transaction. Then I thought about low scale buy/sell trends botting. I managed to get on the $70-90 hike.( missed the massive $250 totally as took a break from bt for a while) But was afk when we had that last good spike to $140. Pains me to buy fresh ones at $120 when they were $70 a week ago. Hence just playing with what I have.

They are worth what ever people are willing to buy them for. It's still a gamble. It will either crash back down or more uses for it will become available and it will go up again. So as soon a big player gets on board though, hold on to your pants.

On the Recipient page on TW it asks for IBAN account number and Bank code (BIC) number. I cant see this anywhere in my account on bitstamp. Where is this located? Sorry in advance for my basic questions.

Being Uk based, It's a total pain in the arse the get bitcoins these days. It's hindering growth greatly in this sector. It's just too much hassle. I used to be able to log onto intersango and wire bank transfer and have my coins within an hour or two. Now I have to go through a whole range of checks that even terrorists don't have too. The interface for gox bank transfers for my particular bank don't except the details for your wire transfer address. Again so much zzzzzzzz trying to get simple online currency.
