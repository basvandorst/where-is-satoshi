Thank you, just followed your instructions on an online order trying to take me through bitpay, it worked, though my nerves are shot now from worrying I would mess it up. I'm not versed in the technical reasoning you give for doing this but I totally agree with the part of why have a middle man? Also have enough god damn accounts I don't need more.

I lost 50 euros worth to bitrefill, on the "Xbox EUR PIN European Union" which cannot be claimed against a UK sterling or British pound xbox account (found out afterwards). I asked their customer services for refund as it was missold and to remove that item from their "SUPPORTED OPERATORS IN UNITED KINGDOM" list but they have have not and stopped responding to me and the EUR pin is still being displayed as available for UK buyers.
Edit: I got a few Steam international vouchers from them no problem, they worked fine. 
 
Edit, 9 Days Later: They removed this key from the available items for UK buyers, yay!!! It was upsetting me that there were companies in the bitcoin community/arena that were so unconcerned to their customers, this make things better.
