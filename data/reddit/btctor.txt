A part of me is beginning to wonder whether an advertising campaign for other wallets is to get onto Reddit and tell people that their blockchain.info wallet was compromised. Perhaps I'm just paranoid...

Well then you made a logical leap that is not evident in the title and that others in the comment thread have clearly not understood as well.
If x confirms that y will not be regulated, it does not imply that x will not regulate y.  It implies, only, that according to x, y will not be regulated. That is simple logic.

**Misleading title.** Bitcoin miners and investors won't be regulated [by this particular department].

Unfortunately, I am not able to donate anonymously using bitcoin on this site.... what gives?

I have half a mind to do that, but again if information is required and I don't provide it... in the United States... that can mean bad news down the line. I don't mean to be overly suspicious, but people can be involved in litigation for absolutely nothing here... so I try to abide by requirements. If there are no requirements, I'm good. If there are requirements and I bypass them with "Not Applicable", I feel unsettled. Maybe just me, but...

The US dollar could be a Ponzi scheme too....

Downloading/distributing lots of copyrighted material is illegal. That doesn't seem to stop anyone from doing it.

I wasn't addressing you specifically, nor did I downvote your post. Please don't take it personally. 
It's just that this is one of a number of posts about people losing all of their coins from blockchain recently. There was in fact another on the front page earlier today. In the end it turns out most of the time that it was a backed up wallet saved somewhere...

Ummm... you definitely cannot leave the fields blank. They all light up in red.

Yeah, no details is one thing. Bogus details... is lying. If there are lawsuit-happy attorneys around EFFs parts (and there are)...
Don't get me wrong. I'd like to make a donation now. Just pondering how to go about it.
EDIT: for clarification, you cannot leave the fields blank. They light up in red and it doesn't allow you to pass through to the next step. The info is definitely required.

I've been watching for a few weeks. Two things that surprise me most: 
1. the pace of the project. It's only been 21 days I think. I highly doubt he'll be able to keep this up with bigger numbers, but the rise in value relative to time has been enormous.
2. how quickly it was able to get legitimacy among serious bitcoin community members. His first transaction was with the CFO of a bitcoin exchange, I think. And every other transaction was with people who've made pretty big contributions to the community. Casascius, obviously, is huge.

No you can't. Try that and get back to me. They light up in red - you must fill in every field.
