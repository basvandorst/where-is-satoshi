Why would you have bought it for a dollar just for shits?  You're full of it.

I wasn't fucking her.  I was giving her sugar.
@_date: 2016-08-02 04:48:00
Was busy.  With your Mom.
@_date: 2016-08-02 01:08:02
How bout spending some time engaging with people who responded to your question there bud? (F-ing troll)
@_date: 2016-08-02 06:08:48
Wow.  After that sentence, I'm gonna go ahead and peg you as below average.  No wonder you have such a hard time grasping basic concepts.
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:11:02
He responded below.  Nothing from you?  F-ing troll.
@_date: 2016-08-02 05:36:37
Ah, so like when one doesn't know how to spell.
@_date: 2016-08-02 01:28:40
Take your 2 month old Wall Street shit disturbing account back to NYC you lying sack.
@_date: 2016-08-02 05:59:18
there we go!  now you're getting it!
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:07:59
You're not an average consumer if you're already spouting off about how banks will be using alternative cryptocurrencies to Bitcoin.  You're a fucking r3 troll.  GTFOH
@_date: 2016-08-02 01:23:04
Hey "average consumer," why not go wait in the wings for your bank coin to come to fruition.  We have work to do around here.  GTFO liar.
@_date: 2016-08-02 04:50:53
My work is done here.  Get you to show your true colors so that your post isn't taken seriously (don't worry at one upvote....it wasn't).  Thus, your weak attempt at sabotaging Bitcoin via this sub was nullified.  Now fuck off back to Wall St. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:06:43
Showing your colors now.  Fucking R3 Ripple troll.  GTFOH
@_date: 2016-08-02 01:15:45
Right.  After getting called out on it.  Good job. Now take your cookie and go the fuck back to wall street.
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:12:34
Top performing currency 5 out of the last 6 years, but let's just go ahead and concoct some made up story about how you learned about it at 1200.
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:32:01
PS, I'm not looking for your respect.
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:10:19
If you don't have any issues with the current system you're ignorant.  Wake the fuck up and read about what Wall Street has done to the global economy.  PS, I'm using this tone because you're not here to learn.  It's obvious by the way you're responding to the comments. You're a fucking bankster troll.
@_date: 2016-08-02 01:17:45
My issue is fake posts from pieces of shit like you. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 05:07:39
Do me a favor.  Write another wall of text I won't read.
@_date: 2016-08-02 05:46:44
Failing = your post (which currently still sits at your 1 upvote...good job).  "Average person" is completely accurate.  
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:48:16
You're choosing to respond to me rather than the people that are spelling out benefits to average consumers.  You know, your question?  Either complete troll or you got in at 1200 and are butt hurt.  Poor kid.
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:29:10
No, it's because you're selectively replying to comments.  That's why.
@_date: 2016-08-02 05:50:05
Oh and btw still haven't read your wall of text but glad to hear you had to type that on your phone lol.
@_date: 2016-08-02 04:31:45
Your Mom made a poor decision.
@_date: 2016-08-02 06:01:46
I prefer non-fiction as opposed to your made up bullshit posts.
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:05:04
Right.  How convenient.  
@_date: 2016-08-02 05:21:16
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:04:40
Sure buddy.  First, you heard about it 5 years ago and then when you get called out on what a good investment it would have been you automagically heard about it when it was at its all time high.  
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:08:38
Fucking R3 trollllllll
@_date: 2016-08-02 06:17:02
Stalk not stock lololol!  Hopefully English is a second language.
@_date: 2016-08-02 06:29:55
Those aren't typos.  Those are errors that reveal your lack of education. Or maybe it's a lack of nutrition.  Sounds like it runs in the family.
@_date: 2016-08-02 05:57:31
TL;DR.  Be more succinct.  You'll get more upvotes.  Take it from someone who is above average.
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:05:59
You're a troll.  You don't get how tech evolves. Read bitqueso's comment.  You're not ready yet.  You have all the answers.
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:36:11
2 month old account selectively responding to questions.  GTFOH
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:45:56
This is cool.  You put it there.  But it's still cool.

Just registered truthbet.com.  So apparently I'm also betting big on Truthcoin now, Roger.

The best part about this tweet is Andreas' logo.
@_date: 2015-06-25 08:08:22
Can see it being an alternative for cam girls too if you can blur out blocks of pixels in video.  You're onto something here dude.

Can you ELI:5?
@_date: 2015-06-19 23:23:02
I think what you're doing is commendable.  Should it not pan out, how much are you seeking for the domain?
@_date: 2015-06-23 19:28:38
Where'd you get those?
@_date: 2015-06-23 20:26:33
Looking at their post history, it's

Why do you think infographics are so popular?  People are stimulated by visuals, by colors.  
@_date: 2015-06-30 07:48:30
No.  Visual imagery is how people learn.

@_date: 2016-06-07 09:52:40
nice!  willing to sell?
@_date: 2016-06-15 18:33:00
Plot twist.  It's you...seeking bits.
@_date: 2017-01-04 08:00:18
would you sell?  if so, how much?
@_date: 2016-12-23 17:52:16
@_date: 2016-12-23 08:08:29
thx.  meaning the bigger the candlestick the more volume traded? Anything else you would relay that would be good to know?

More stylish but American Apparel and more expensive.
@_date: 2015-08-11 19:18:02
Yes.  There are other bitcoin artists that do original work.  
@_date: 2015-07-05 00:22:02
If this bitcoin thing doesn't work out, you have a career in writing clickbait headlines for Buzzfeed.

BREAKING: Newsweek now claims Dorian is Greek
@_date: 2016-09-06 03:19:02
Fair enough.  Good luck with the project.
@_date: 2016-09-05 07:21:06
If you want people to take you seriously, you need to be more descriptive about what you want and why you want it.  The current approach of conveying as little as possible isn't going to get you serious inquiries.  It's amateurish.
@_date: 2016-09-05 19:13:28
And I'm telling you that if you want to fill orders faster, you should present what you're doing in a more professional manner.

Who makes the ING BTC shirt?
@_date: 2015-11-27 19:34:54
You just don't get it do you?
@_date: 2015-10-26 21:36:23
?  No this is for publicizing bitcoin-related projects through third party websites like Coindesk.
@_date: 2015-10-03 03:36:45
How does your comment have anything to do with someone donating a work of art to help Dorian out?
@_date: 2015-10-02 19:20:07
You misspelled talented.
