Ripple partnered with Japanese banks, and it's been undervalued for a long time. It's a good coin, not competing with bitcoin at all. It has very different goals.

Inb4 bitcoin is misogynistic and the work of the patriarchy.

I really find it hard to believe that so many people who claim to have something worth millions of dollars decide to ask reddit for advice. If you actually do, stop telling the internet and call a reputable tax lawyer/accountant ASAP.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:26:37
Yeah, on BTC markets you can. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:57:14
Pretty sure he got in months ago.... so he's doing just fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:48:01
Already happened today
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:28:02
Dropping drastically...? This is an extremely small drop. Drastic would be 20-50% in a day. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:30:19
I would just put in $10-15k in if I was you... you can still make a decent profit while not needing to worry about having nothing if it crashes hard.

You multiply how much BTC you have (0.009099) by how much 1 BTC is worth (100,000). 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:21:34
You made a mistake. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:05:21
Sounds like a shitty friend to me 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:12:35
You should commit some money to it every week/month. But there's no harm in putting $50 in. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:05:55
There was a live leak link when it first went up
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:45:43
The price would be under 1k if it was only bought by people who use it for its intended purpose though.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:22:21
They are real if it's in AUD
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:46:51
Didn't really make much sense. He claims that it could take 5-10 years for it to reach 500k-1m like that's a bad thing. That's a 10,000%+ increase. There are close to no conventional investments that even have a chance at giving that type of return. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:01:08
Yeah, considering governments seize a few thousand dollars without reason when they can, there's not a chance that I would be voluntarily handing over tens of millions of dollars to them. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:26:13
One guy says unless something goes wrong it will be worth $1m+ in 2017 and got downvoted lmao
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:14:07
Yes, you can invest any amount of money. You can purchase 0.00001 BTC if you want. Most people have less than 1 bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:59:33
Use BTCmarkets
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:27:43
It will either be 0 or high six figures in 2020, not 20k

Houses that are literally falling apart in Sydney sell for millions of dollars. 20sqm&gt; apartments have sold for close to half a million dollars. So no. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:54:57
No one knows. You aren't going to make ton of money in the short term though. Hodl for 5+ years and it'll probably be worth a bit. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:07:16
Buy small amounts every day. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:18:06
I love how he bitches about people 'waving it in his face' that he was wrong when he wrote an entire article trying to making fun of anyone who thought bitcoin was a good investment in 2013. 
Can't stand these people, just admit you were wrong. Admit that whether or not you believe in bitcoin, it was a good investment.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:20:22
It's legit, but I would always recommend cold storage for any significant amount of crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:04:09
I prefer btcmarkets, very simple to use. It did take me about a week to set up my account though, because they had to send a letter to my residence with a code as ID verification.

'Wealthy gambler' = con artist. The guys Dad was a massive fraud and served prison time for tax evasion in the hundreds of millions that has still never been paid back. He hasn't won shit playing poker. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:47:46
I put in order at $9999 :( wishing I just put 10100 
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:54:56
Nick Szabo would be my guess. But as Vitalik [said]( Craig Wright clearly isn't because the real Satoshi could very easily prove who they are.

I've had this screen up on my second monitor for weeks, so glad to see it sit at 10K AUD+.

The legal proceedings concluded that they be paid out in Yen equal to the cost of the bitcoins at the time. Some of the victims are still fighting to have it changed though:

Good games don’t die. Old games like Runescape, Counter Strike, Smash bros, Pokémon etc. stay alive because they’re good. If a game dies, it’s because no one wants to play it and it’s therefore considered bad by most people.

Let's say I buy into a coin and make a profit, I then sell that coin for $ on the exchange and put all of it into another coin on the same exchange. That coin then crashes to nothing. Do I still pay tax on the initial profit I made?
