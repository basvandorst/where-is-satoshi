And it's a stupid way to communicate.  
Do they mean what they say in plain language?  Do we need to figure out how else they weasel their words? 
Now "regulators" are figuring how they can "regulate" in a hurry.
Why not something like "We can provide these functions in X states, with regulatory compliance where required."

lol.  As far as I can tell, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  
This isn't their first rodeo.

Seriously, what's the point?

Yep...  It's one of a few reasons why I'm choosing stripe over paypal for a particular project I'm starting.

This is one area where the US is far ahead of China.
When you buy something in the US, they already know who you are.
And if you happen to buy a computer or phone with cash, they know they'll figure out who you are soon enough.

Nobody cares.  Labor theory of value...  look it up.

That seems just a little "too real."

That judge is just plain dumb.  These are his actual words...
"If you're following the bill of rights, you have every right to be able to go before a judge, present your probable cause, and if he sees that that's a right, get a warrant, and get into that machine."
The bill of rights...  the document that gives rights to cop-types to get search warrants.

It was a Samsung, called the i700.  Ok, not 2002, but 2004 and it predated the iphone by 3 years.  It ran windows, had MS Office, and a 400 MHz intel cpu.


We all know how Samsung, Intel, and Microsoft died.  


Well, that is still often true.

Because...  really, that's what governments are all about...  being nice to those who finance their existence.  
That may have sounded like sarcasm at first, but nah.

If that were really true...  would you guys be having this conversation at all?

That's not really his position.  His position is mostly that he doesn't care what people use for currency, and doesn't feel it should be determined by laws. 
He doesn't need to know a single thing about bitcoin to feel that way.  He's a gold advocate because governments inflate their currencies at the expense of citizens.  
Just as a guess, I doubt he would consider bitcoin to be a store of value in the same way as precious metals.

You mean instead of trading chickens for cows and apples, we can trade pieces of paper indicating units of value stored somewhere??
Interesting idea, but paper can be damaged easily or stolen.  Not to mention, how many papers is a chicken worth?  It's all so confusing.
Seriously, though...  I think it is important to listen to those perspectives.  But most people have no idea how banks work, and that doesn't stop them from participating in an economy or using banks.

Information is important.  Actually, cryptography, in general, relies on that premise, or there would be no use or reason.
I can think of a lot of situations where information regarding water purification is more important than other things. What about information regarding antibiotic use?  What foods to plant in the spring or fall?  Where do you drill for water?
Information can be extremely important.  Life and death, even.  
A bitcoin balance?  You need a lot of things happening otherwise for that to be more important than the other things I mentioned.

I agree with pretty much everything you just wrote...  except for this...


It has the same portability as gold futures. In some ways, bitcoin has a lot less portability than gold, the element.  Without widespread electronics, bitcoin becomes useless.  I can give gold to nearly any 10 year old  with 2 minutes of instruction, and it can be transferred and retain value.  
Bitcoin gets rid of some "trust" issues regarding paper gold. But especially right now, it requires a lot of technology. When people desire to be their own banks, they are usually anticipating bleak times.  In bleak times, industrial assets have a better chance at retaining value than electronic assets.

The lesson here is that no company who works for (or with) the US government can be trusted.

Depends on who you are, and where you live.


Hmmm, really?  What is bitcoin, essentially?  Bitcoin is information. Very specific information.  Wars are fought not just with information, but also over information.  Let's say things really go south.  What has more value? Your private key, or ???  Can you think of anything?  I can think of thousands of things.
