Lmfao what a scam
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:40:05
Ahhh I see. Should’ve looked into it myself, I saw some post on here saying that they determine what chain to use 24 hours after the fork
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:11:20
Me either. The people buying since they’re confident now should offset the effect of people selling cause of cancellation. BTC dip that much
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:08:58
That’s exactly what a bot would say
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:46:27
Ideally they’d be in jail, but oligarchs don’t go to jail. I get your point tho.
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:19:34
Bitcoin wet tissue paper
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:02:20
So should I sell, then just buy back right after it dips?
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:13:41
For sure!
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:47:42
Y tho
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:48:27
It is this that is why idk if I’d ever be able to commit to selling my btc even tho I only own a bit over .1 atm. If I sell now I’m missing out on the potential gains that are yet to come. Shits why I hodl

I’d say a lot are probably neither. The assumption that political views only range between Liberal and Conservative is something I think just comes with American culture. Both are just variations of beliefs in free market capitalism with different views on social issues.
Edit: if I had to guess I would say this sub is a strongly libertarian/anarchist. Whether that be right-leaning or left-leaning.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:06:34
Good advice. I’ve never considered something like that
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:09:11
The three little dots in the top right on the post. For mobile at least
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:22:11
Probably, they will definitely try to. The corporatocracy hates crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:09:16
I’m no expert, but I think the combination of the first two will keep it at an equilibrium. I don’t think it would dip under $7000 tbh
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:06:27
Have you been living under a rock
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:54:01
Lmfao at this rate we’re gonna be talking about the upcoming “Bitcoin Paper Towel” fork by next year
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:54:09
I’m part of the casual btc owners who operate through Coinbase and I just recently made sense of the whole thing, and there’s no way I can trust these corporations to not screw us for profit. I don’t really know if what to do if 2x happens, would you shift to a new crypto?
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:52:32
I'll have to look at that, so it's cheaper that way?
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:37:27
Coinbase is FDIC insured tho
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:03:23
Hmmm yeah I could throw a fraction of every check into my savings then at the end of the month throw it all in Coinbase at once 
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:09:48
Would you recommend I adopt what you're doing or just directly put a fraction of each check directly into Gemini when I cash it?
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:30:42
I’m gonna get a trezor hardware wallet. It seems a lot more simple and secure than a normal cold wallet. But to be clear, I’m not gonna get the shitty corporate 2x chain right??
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:02:27
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:05:54
Oh I’ll probably do that then buy the Trezor when there’s a clear indicator of the surviving chain, hopefully it’ll be the core one. I don’t wanna drop a bunch of money on a Trezor only for btc to die
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:12:14
Yeah I’m not leaving my BTC on an exchange anymore, I’m gonna move it over to electrum for now. I’m kinda confused, so if I can sell the Btc on Coinbase as either Legacy or 2x, would the btc im about to move from Coinbase to Electrum and eventually a Trezor sell as Legacy or both? I apologize for my ignorance on this whole thing.
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:40:28
Shit, when is it estimated to happen? I’m not sure if I’ll receive the Trezor in time. I may have to teach myself of following that complicated process of moving it to a cold storage fml
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:37:24
Damn, I don’t even know what you mean by replaying. Fuck I guess I should hold off on Electrum i don’t fucking know
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:41:11
Apparently y'all don't answer emails lmfao
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:34:49
Yeah that's the problem thank you
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:22:58
I just got $10 more just cause haha
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:19:23
Should I buy more just to sell it later? Idk shit about this����
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:38:01
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:58:26
I originally just got it to buy a fake id but like I'm kinda interested in this I could make money off this
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:20:23
����I'm scurred bro it's my first ever
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:35:35
I got it from CoinBase
