You write the 12 words on two pieces of paper. And hide them in two differents locations. If one backup is destroyed because of a fire or flood you are still ok. 
Fees are relatively cheap now 
But the exact fees you should pay depends on the size the transaction you need to make. The number of inputs...

You can import the private key but this is error prone. 
You better create a seeded Electrum wallet and sweep the keys. Yes I know you will need to pay a fee to send your fund but your wallet will be more easy to manage. You just need to backup your seed. You can do it in the weekend to save on fees.

You could mint some coins in various denominations (like 0.01btc, 0.1btc, ...) that are difficult to counterfeit. A third party (a bitcoin minter) would keep the value of the coin in a cold wallet somewhere. Each coins would have a unique id on them. To add some credibility the bitcoin minter could keep an online list of all the coins in circulations with the corresponding address and you could have the possibility to  get the fund under the coin in bitcoin if you give back the physical coin to the minter.

Encrypt it and store it in multiple physical location is way better than a 1/2 hour fire proof safe. 
For example. If you keep your encrypted paper wallet in your house and at a relative house and in your google drive. If all those physical location explode because of terrible accident or a nuclear war. You won't care about Bitcoin.

I don't like the private key can be written on the note or the coin itself like a paper wallet or a Casascius coin. The notes only have a unique id like a serial number. I see a 3rd party (a Bitcoin bank) keeping all the private keys. The note itself need to be difficult to counterfeit like the new polymer banknotes. You should be able to go to the bank and ask for the value in bitcoins like they use to do with gold.

It will cost you nothing to send 1562btc (1 millions USD). But if you want to send 1 millions USD from USA to Canada for example. You will need to exchange your USD to bitcoins. Send the bitcoins and exchange again your bitcoins to CAD. When exchanging fiat and bitcoins you will pay some convertion fees to the exchanges.

Ok then imagine that a guy or a government want to disrupt Bitcoin. They buy 2-3 or more domain names. 
Each pool have no fees. The pools operator does not care about loosing a little bit of money to operate the pools because all he want is the hashing power of the miners. After a few weeks the combined hashing power of the pools have more than 51% of the hashing power and he can wreak havoc on Bitcoin.

IMO, it's more logical that the miners are spamming the network. Because they benefit from higher fees 
And the spam is cheaper because they collect a fraction of the fees the pay for the spam. For example, if 50% of the miners plot to spam the network. The spam cost 50% less because they recollect the fees when they mine the blocks.

It will take time for your client to buy bitcoins on a short notice.

Is it me or if you own an 18% margin ATM. You or one of your friend buy $1000 worth of bitcoins. You just made $180 in profit. Do it several times and you can launder some money. You can do that with a 3% machine but it takes more time.

I'm not sure if you can deduct the loss on other capital gain you could have made this year or a previous one. But you should write your loss because if you make a gain in bitcoin next year or another one you could reduce your gain from the loss of this year.

Yes. Wallet.dat contains everything. Put that on (at least) 2 USB keys. 
Personally I prefer Electrum because I can just backup the wallet more easily. Just a list of words to backup. Later if you reinstall your computer.  You can just install Electrum and re-enter the words of your wallet and you are good to go. Two advantages :
- no blockchain to download
- you can backup your wallet (list of words) on a simple sheet on paper.

I'm smiling each time I see a price target for a stock. In fact what they do is simple. They take the current price and add a percentage. If they are positive about a stock they add something like 20% if they are negative they only add like 5%. When the price of Bitcoin will reach $1275 they will output another price target of something like $1500. They just wants to look like they know their shit.

I think it cost a lot less to do an attack on Bitcoin. 
Now, you can buy a 500G miner for $5000. You need around 10 000 miner to equal the actual hashrate of 5000T. It will cost you $50 000 000.
Now lets suppose that a company like KncMiner wants to do an attack. I don't know their cost to produce a 500G miner but I'm sure it's a lot less than $5000. So for them the cost to break Bitcoin would be a lot less than $50 000 000.

Related to the title. This is how I see a Bitcoin physically:
* 100 nanogram of Bitcoin == 0.00000001BTC  (1 satoshi)
* 1 microgram of Bitcoin ==     0.0000001BTC  (10 satoshi)
* 1 milligram of Bitcoin ==       0.0001BTC
* 1 gram of Bitcoin ==            0.1BTC
* 10 gram ==                         1BTC
* 1 kilo of Bitcoin ==           100BTC
* 1 fuckton of Bitcoin ==     100 000BTC
* 100 tonnes of Bitcoin == 10 000 000BTC
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:36:00
Yeah and also implement fractional reserve and also generate Bitcoin randomly to replicate quantitative easing and also we need a centralized service to decide if a payment should go through or not depending on some changing rules.
