Everyone keeps saying this can't be done, which in its current state is mostly true, the PI's puny processor would never keep up with the network or block verification, but what if you could modify Bitcoin-Core (and or just modify the operating system) to offload all the hashing required to verify transactions and the blockchain off to a usb block errupter? Sure 300 Mhashes is worthless for mining, but its more than enough to verify the block chain and lave all the rest of the work to the PI (which the PI should be capable of moving stuff around and reading/writing to the drive)

We start to get into semantics if we try to decide if enforcing rules against contract violations or theft is 'regulation'. 
Now you really could spin it that way if you tried and I would see it as a valid view point, if not the usual one for the term, but in the context of Libertarianism enforcement of property rights and contracts are not considered to be 'regulation'

Yes but you need to have the port open to the internet (accept outgoing connections) to be at all useful as a full node. And then you need to be able to upload blocks without issue. Finally you need high uptime to be the sort of node the network needs a lot of (ones people will know about and be able to connect to reliably) 
These are all things home machines are bad at but servers are great at.

Multiple pools would be an interesting thing. They would need to lower their payouts to miners to match their reported rate and then take their other miners and out them on another pool. Possible but somewhat elaborate. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 12:09:53
What needs to happen is pretty straight forward (but like all obvious plans hard to implement) 
1. Make software to connect to a p2p pool and/or run a node that is easier to use, setup, and find than existing pool mining software. 
2. Make that software default to the largest p2p pool meeting a given set of conditions (mostly multimining probably, not sure if p2p pool can do multimining, it should just be a matter of more overhead) this means its easy to setup with the best payout rate possible. Since p2p pool cant be used for a 51% attack going for the largest pool becomes a safe idea. 
3. Subsidize, create a pool donation address such that whatever gets sent to that address will be distributed as if it where a found block. Then send a hell of a lot of coin using this method to whatever p2p chain was largest, this makes that chain more profitable than any other pool till the extra coins are done being distributed, miners move over to increase their profits in the short term, the goal is to keep the subsidies going on long enough that the p2p pool chain becomes the most stable earnings / profitable pool, or at least breaks even.
At the end of this the miners who you incentiveized to switch should either have negative reason to switch back (lots profits) or at the very least no good reason.

tor has exactly the same issue, just observe where the packet entered tor, then observe what came out of the exit node, if you can observe the whole network this is trivial. 
Best way to fix it is that all traffic is in encrypted blocks of a fixed size, lots of bandwidth would be wasted sending incomplete blocks and padding them to the minimum size but it would be possible to hide where exactly transactions originated unless the attacker ran a majority of nodes in the network.

You need really really stupid easy to use p2pool software that autoconnects to the largest p2p pool available (since that is not any risk with p2pool and miners will want to not have to worry about changing pool stats messing with the reliability of their earnings) 
This software also needs to be able to handle mutlimining on all SHA coins and the ability to distribute 'pool donations' over time like block rewards. 
You then send a lot of donations to the pool to subsidize mining there, people move over to it temporarily because its easy to setup and will make higher earnings until the subsidies run out. 
Then you just keep the subsidies up until enough people have moved over that this particular p2p pool chain now competes with all major pools. Ideally this gives minors little or no reason to return to their original pools.

With header only blocks why does this matter very much? It sounds mostly like a problem of setting up the default full clients to chose a section of the block chain to store in completion and then ensure that's distributed evenly so that no one section gets under provisioned. 
The biggest advantage of a setup like that is that you can transition 'light' clients into clients that store some portion of the block chain based on their capabilities, even if its just 1gb or something.  
Of course this is a much more complicated solution than I'm making it sound and it does require that we eventually prune really old sections of the chain that we can guarantee are no longer relevant. But all of these are eventual requirements at any block size (unbounded growth is unbounded growth regardless of the rate). Better to start now anyways.

And this is why I should have re-wrote that part a couple of times. The point of Hocnet is that its not supposed to be a wireless mesh network (its not even a mesh network really, does not meet the definition because not all nodes do routing) the idea is to route data over whatever method is available. A wireless connection for 2 or 3 hops to bridge the gap between a user and a cable or other higher bandwidth solution is the idea here. Demand for wireless spectrum keeps the cost high and pushes traffic to cables, IR, or some other form of transmission not so congested in as few hops as possible. Wireless is great to bridge the gap and the principle of Hocnet is to use supply, demand, and prices to manage usage of limited resources like the spectrum.

I have no doubt the situation you describe would happen quite often, probably even more so than the situation I describe what makes the idea for Hocnet unique is that it is an attempt to mix economics and programming to make a network that in large part builds itself. The idea is no more crazy than people spending thousands of dollars mining internet coins, or that people would build software for said internet coins. 
Its a crazy idea and it may be totally impossible, but I think its worth trying even if I only end up with more than I ever need to know about networking. I wanted to get the idea out there and talk it out with some new ears, I have launched projects before and reception at this stage is never very good, but you can always learn a good bit and help flesh out your idea with new questions. 
Lots of attempts at digital money failed before Bitcoin and i would not be surprised if this idea fails as well, but the more I look at the set of problems the more convinced I am that something like this would be the best solution. Maybe I am missing the stroke of genius, like Bitcoin's proof of work that makes it possible. But I am not worried, worst case scenario I learn something and meet interesting people.

Bandwidth is something almost anyone can produce, with a good mesh protocol you could get a signal from one end of a city to another just hopping from smart phone to smart phone. The problems with this are. 
* How do you get people to use it?
* How do you make it easy to use?
* How do you design the tech behind it all?
The tech mostly already exists, CJDNS and project Meshnet have made leaps and bounds of progress on this, but the problem with any network is that bandwith is a limited resource that everyone wants to consume by no one wants to provide.
The solution is simple, money, a market, get people to provide bandwidth in exchange for payment and suddenly the data hogs have to pay for it and everyone wants to provide it. 
tl;dr Make mobile connectivity cheap and universal by commoditizing bandwidth and lowering the barriers to entry to nil. Highly competitive markets trend prices to minimum possible amounts.

Its similar to in that its supposed to be an alternate network to the existing Internet. But with a much more ambitious purpose, to provide a simple way for individuals to take part in the buying and selling of bandwidth as a commodity, breaking up the oligopolies of current ISP's by allowing each part of the network to bought from different individuals, thus allowing real competition in the market.  
@_date: 2012-06-15 22:34:08
Wireless provides a great way to get the data the last small distance, but you are very correct about how impractical it is to run a whole network over it. 
In the beginning the vast majority of connections would go straight for the existing Internet and the protocol would act mostly as a easy way for private individuals to sell their connections. Over time it would become practical for less intense users to stop paying comcast and just buy from their neighbors, as the wifi spectrum got crowded prices would go up and anyone who invested a few hundred in an IR connection some distance could make back that investment by selling the connection. 
So to more directly answer your questions, those who provide the services are getting paid, it could be anyone providing just about any sort of connection, its not meant to change into a decentralized network overnight, prices are based on supply and demand so supplying a fast connection will be done however is profitable, early on that will be piggybacking on existing infrastructure but eventually that 20k may be a good investment. As for who is responsible, who is responsible that people have food to buy? Any individual supermarket can shut down at will, but through competition food is available very nearly universally.

But from a theoretical perspective it can and will handle them just fine. Various optimizations can be done to make it more reasonable to verify and store many transactions. And even dedicated hardware is more than possible.

There is a rather simple way to make them almost totally trustworthy, Mining pools need to create a method where you can pay them a small fee to transmit and have them immediately rebroadcast a new transaction. Since mining pools often have hundreds of connections if you managed to pass a transaction to just a few major ones it would spread to thousands of nodes in just 2 hops, since double spending requires the transactions to race it would effectively ensure that the second spending attempt would fail as the majority of the network would be notified of the fist spend almost instantaneously while the double spend would never make it more than a couple of hops, much less far enough to confuse a seller.  
@_date: 2012-06-15 23:20:25


The protocol is open source, the company produces consumer devices with closed source software that uses the protocol. I have been trying to keep them somewhat separate, but I see that it causes confusion. 


The sad reality of most start ups is that they fail rather quickly if they ever make a profit at all. Reliability comes through competition and profit motive, meaning when a major provider goes down there will be quite a few very happy smaller providers to pick up the slack.  Or individuals who don't hope to make a profit but only to mitigate their costs. So basically, they call no one, costs go up and everyone rushes in to cash in on the profit.

The Internet is a giant hackjob! With NAT's, patches, and stopgaps everywhere you look. Why does it work? Because people are paid and millions of dollars ride on each one of these patches, its hardly a pretty solution, but it works and works well because there are people working around the clock 365 days a year keeping it working. 
And thats the problem with previous mesh networks, they tried to really automate that task, they wanted to create the Internet with nothing more than software, that's not what we are trying to do here, all Hocnet is supposed to be is a standardized way to connect to another person and pay for bandwidth. The standardization (just like the Internet) is only on the surface, people need to be behind that to make it work and keep it working, those people need to be paid. Hocnet does that, previous concepts tried to eliminate the need or somehow manage the same results out of charity. 
Mesh networks where impractical on a large scale because  they either needed capital (in the form of wired infrastructure) or more effort and resources than you could ever expect out of major nodes. Your statement is similar to having a history of Bitcoin like digital currencies where the Miners where never paid and saying 'digital currency cant work on large scale because no one will donate enough processing power' its not a flaw with the software but a flaw with how your using it. Hocnet is not supposed to eliminate wires, just make it possible to lay a single wire between two cities and have it used efficiently. Its about making competition possible by letting different people own much of the same infrastructure instead of a single company. 
CJDNS is not about anonymity, its more basic than that. Tor, i2p, freenet? They all need the existing Internet, they rely on it being too big to shutdown, CJDNS is building a platform that can't be shut down, provides better and more connectivity and lets anonymity networks be build on top of them just like every one of your networks exists over the existing Internet. 
Also if you want to really understand the potential of CJDNS please read [this paper](

In the start yes, kind of like how many electric companies just buy power from a competitor and re-sell it. Comcast could start jacking the cost of its subscriptions, or ban anyone but business connections from reselling bandwidth, but demand makes it cost feasible and over time building of separate infrastructure also becomes cost feasible. 
For example we have a user, they buy a connection from Comcast, then they move to buy it from the person next door using Hocnet. John, that guy next door, has a few customers on the street and turns a nice profit. Comcast then bans reselling bandwidth from home connections, but the infrastructure is already there as people have bought devices to use the protocol, that means John can buy a business connection thats not only faster than before but lets him resell again as other people do the same more and more individuals adopt the needed devices, George lives in a section of the neighborhood thats far away from John, so his latency is pretty high, by buying a cheap IR setup he can link up with another house much closer, traffic now moves over that connection instead of WiFi to that section of the neighborhood, George makes his money back and then some as his connection makes it possible for more people to stop paying Comcast. By the time Comcast simply bans Hocnet its feasible to buy directly from a company like level 3 and use the infrastructure that evolved in my description to get it the last mile. 
This may seem long and convoluted, but its much less complicated than the story of some mining pools, Bitcoin more than anything is similar in requiring users to take complex action with nothing more than monetary incentives.

The same one we are using right now, reselling bandwidth from a Comcast subscription is appealing and for those who only use a few gigs a month the thought of buying some of mine for a low cost is also appealing. Thats really all it would be for quite some time. 


Not to mention you couldn't support native SMS or phonecalls with your service.
From the perspective of a single company its incredibly costly and totally impractical, but from a consumer perspective things change. Most individuals are already paying for a home internet subscription, walk down a city street and there is not a single inch of NYC above groud where you could not get wifi coverage if you only knew the password to every network. All of those people are paying for a home connection, most of them don't use but a fraction of it. What incentive can we give people to let others use their connection? Money, to them the costs of reselling bandwidth are exactly zero, they already would buy a router, already pay for internet, and already pay for the power to keep that router running. Sell consumer products that let them do this easily, and apps on phones to let people buy it so that they can avoid paying for a expensive data plan. 
Over time the network becomes more complex as adoption increases and it becomes more profitable to build infrastructure and practical for more individuals to drop their existing subscriptions and buy from someone else.

yup, but you would have to do so many transactions to add up to anything significant, average transaction is 1kb you would need to do 1000 of them to even get a single mb thats 100000 transactions to even hit 100mb. The coins would not transfer fast enough to really gunk up the block chain without transaction fees, and if they use transaction fees the amount of coins they transfer would atrophy into nothing. Put simply 200mb is small if some pranksters want to make it bigger it will be a lot of trouble and time for them and not really a problem for us.

I understand that its quite complex (that's why something like this is necessary for now) the loss of connection problem is a serious one that will require some careful coding to ensure the transaction is sent the second the connection is reestablished. If the full-app supports NFC (or really any method of direct phone to phone connection) one phone could broadcast the transaction directly to the receiver, allowing them to see the 0 confirmation transaction instantaneously.

From the [scalability page on the Bitcoin wiki](


The big cost is the crypto and block chain lookups involved with verifying the transaction. An ECDSA verification of a transaction input takes around 3msec on a modern Intel core. RIPEMD-160 runs at 106 megabytes/sec (call it 100 for simplicity) and SHA256 is about the same. So hashing 1 megabyte should take around 10 milliseconds and hashing 1 kilobyte would take 0.01 milliseconds, ie it's dwarfed by the cost of the ECDSA and thus can be ignored.
So the slowest part of verifying a transaction is verifying its inputs, which is ~3 msec per input on todays hardware. It seems like in the current blockchain most transactions have only one input, and a few have more like 5/6 inputs. Let's call it an average of 2 inputs overall. However each transaction input is verified twice: once when first received, and a second time when a block containing that transaction is received, so call it 12msec in total per transaction.
This means a single core today can probably, with tuning and the block chain held in RAM but no special hardware beyond that, verify and accept about 80 transactions/sec. This means a network node capable of keeping up with VISA would need roughly 50 cores + whatever is used for mining (done by separate machines/GPUs). Whilst building a single machine with 50 cores would be kind of a pain load balancing inbound "tx" messages over multiple machines would be very easy. Certainly a single machine could easily load balance all of VISAs transactions to a small group of verification machines which would then send the verified tx hash to the miners for incorporation into the merkle tree.
For receiving and handling all the "tx" messages, you therefore could build a rack of 12 4-core machines that would keep up.
That leaves the inbound inv messages. The cost of handling an inv is basically reading a small message from the network and then doing a RAM lookup to see if we already have the transaction. This is really, really fast. A single core could easily handle several thousand inv messages per second before breaking a sweat, even assuming it needs to read from a sharded in-memory block chain index.

You could do that, but then you would only be able to do it once unless they also controlled all the receiving addresses. The smaller the amount of btc they transfer is the smaller the transfer size, a transaction of .0000001 btc to a million people would take just a little bit more room on the list than a 1btc transfer , so they would need millions of bitcoins to gunk up the list either way.

If you have the full block chain you can confirm the transaction yourself the second you receive it (if phone bitcoin clients where nfc they could talk to the stores node directly as a peer, thus the store would receive the transaction instantaneously and hence be able to confirm it instantaneously) the only reason you would want to wait for confirmations other than your own is if you is if you where worried about a double spending attack, which as Not_Satoshi_Nakamoto pointed out is nigh impossible for a mere mortal.

@_date: 2011-07-04 11:55:14


Sorry to but in, but that issue has been resolved, if you look [here]( you will see that the bandwidth problem is solved by setting up nodes to package the blocks themselves, as they confirm transactions going through the network they keep them and when the next block is found they download the 80kb header and then package the transactions into a block locally, no need to download gigabyte blocks so long as the nodes have been online since the last block was generated. If a peer missed a block, instead of downloading the whole 1gig block from a single peer it will request all the transactions contained in the block allowing it to download form multiple peers and then package the transactions and header into a block locally. Combine this with GPU accelerated transaction processing, and pruning of the transaction list ensuring that nodes only need to store 27% of the total size of the transaction list and you could build a visa-level node for about $1600 today, much less in the future. 
@_date: 2011-07-23 21:55:27
Its an arms race to maximum efficiency, trying to wring as many hashes as possible out of the same amount of power, the step from CPU to GPU brought security up and power consumption down, the step to ASCI or FGPA will be the same, and before you say that a system of money should not have so much power dedicated to it think of all the trucks, buildings, factories, and regulatory agencies that mining takes the place of.

@_date: 2011-05-31 02:01:48
Thats te exact idea. The problem is that you would have to spend the time to mine both sets before doing it, you could just as easily mine the same amount in valid btc.

As stated above you could currently build a visa-capable node for about $1500,  thats not that bad and there is ever increasing incentive to do so (solo mining, buisnesses could escape transaction fees by running their own node) .  The only change that may need to made for bitcoin to achive visa-level trading with grace would be to setup the block upload/download code to work like bittorrent (downloads different parts of a block from different peers at the same time) after this is done 1gig blocks would be able to spread through the network without too much trouble. And this is assuming current hardware specs, internet speeds etc. At the rate tech advances the cost of building a visa-level machine will half in two years. As the hardware requrements to run a full bitcoin node go up tech advances will keep the cost of building a fullnode realtivly low, low enough that we will have a few hundred thousand at the veary least running full nodes, possible many more.  Even if the requirements for running a node jumped to visa-levels tonight we would have more than enough full-chain nodes to prevent collusion by the end of the week.

These 'problems' are one of three things
1) Opinion problems
This includes Bitcoins deflationary nature, the method by with miners are paid, and the distribution of coins. 
2) Protocol problems
Most of these arise from a flaw in understanding the Bitcoin protocol, for example faster blocks. The blocks where put at 10 minutes to prevent chain splits, which is worse 10 minute blocks or every so often transactions lose all their confirmations and miners their coins when two blocks are found at the same time, this can happen in the normal network, but the 10 minute block time keeps the occurence very low, lower the time for making blocks and it it goes up exponentaly. 
3)Development speed
A lot of things planed in the original white paper have not yet been implemented, and some people feel that the dev team needs to pick up the pace, coding secure software takes time, and lots of it. I would much much rather a secure client over getting wallet encryption a month sooner.

On the other hand your hand made shirt may have more value to some people that want a hand made item, that is demand giving your shirt more value, not your work. Even if you marked down your shirt below the price of the loom shirt (and many times below the 'worth' of your labor) most people would still buy the loom one, because there is demand for higher quality shirts, its not the effort that gave either of these value, if the entire world when around topless no one would want shirts and they would have no value to anyone, no matter the effort used to create them, it is demand that gives one value over the other.

This is just one route, it would also be possible to create partial nodes, instead of having a super node or a simple node each user would be able to specify a block chain size and a max bandwidth and the client would download a portion of the block chain and use the allotted bandwidth to confirm transactions from that section of the block chain. This could be a little hard to code, but it is possible. Super nodes and partial nodes could coexist in the same system.

So yes it can be done, its just dam difficult. Maybe in a few years when many btc have been lost we could get enough support to have people come forward with lost bitcoins and the address of their wallet and we can get essentially a popular vote to return their money (dont this for just one person it a ton of effort, but one large patch can give back coins to thousands at a time).

But that's not the problem, your estimation on the cost of a 50% attack falls into the common trap of assuming you can **actually buy** large enough quantities of cards to preform a 51% attack. The mining community alone has the best cards sold out, and even in a best case scenario electricity, facilities and the costs for the rest of the machine (ram cpu mobo) push it well above your estimated number. My point is, the best mining cards are already in tight supply, there is no way any entity could gather up the needed number of cards in less than 6 months, and if they tried it would be obvious to everyone and their dog what they where doing. They only way to really get enough power is to manufacture the cards yourself, or seize every card factory on earth (or at least the vast majority) the first is massively expensive, the second would bring enough attention to Bitcoin to bring new miners using already purchased cards into the network, preventing an attack.

on average the difficulty adjusts every 2 weeks (at the 6 blocks an hour rate, its not by time its in blocks so every x number of blocks it adjusts the difficulty) so depending on how many drop out it could take a good bit longer than 2 weeks, but for it to take months 75%+ of all miners would have to drop out at the current difficulty. Also keep in mind if blocks are less common a single block will hold more transactions and thus have more transactions fees, so the reward could be a bit higher than normal for people who actually find blocks.

Why involve the middle man?
@_date: 2011-07-06 13:02:38
Its does not matter what it costs, you simply can not get the cards you need to exceed the current hashing power before hashing power goes up again, they simply dont make them that fast. The bitcoin community alone has all the good mining cards sold out everywhere, much less a large agency trying to buy years worth of card production in months.

I meant he is correct, mining  the process required to confirm transactions by placing them in blocks is by design resource intensive. But people chose to mine and no resource intensive process is required on the senders part or the receivers part.

But on to the main topic, under anarco-capitalism land can not be owned until someone does something with it (farming, factory, road, house etc) as such you would be free to claim the property that the government currently claims to "own".

The problem is that it needs to be a card not a powered computer, to work like a debit card this is the only solution. And i will be the first to admit it is kind of risky, but if properly designed you could make a system that would allow people to use the card as a mobile bitcoin wallet that did not have to be expensive or complex like a smart phone. The approach the bitbucks has taken is the only other way to do this without power and to be honest its probably a much better solution now that i think about it.

As it stands serious modification of the code would be necessary for even the smallest amount of regulation. The devs have no power to force us to upgrade or use a system that would make regulation possilbe any attempt to do so would cause immediate abandonment of their code and the formation of a new Dev team. As it is more attention needs to be paid to the source code to ensure no such measures are being coded in.

A ponzi scheme, stealing credit card info those are the scams, but with the incredible ablity, skill and thought put into Bitcoin i have no doubt that they devs could have developed just about anything. Scammers do not try and do somthing new, somthing that people will look at closley,  they do not stray from the beaten path because 99% of those fail. Even more most scams are not fronted to experts in the fileld, they can easliy see problems, but insted to people that know little or nothing about it, Bitcoins source was offerd up for scrutiny by the experts since day one.

How would you buy only the last 5 blocks from mt gox? I dont think that the bitcoins would be sold quickly enough after being mined (much less be identifiable as newly mined blocks before you purchased) for you to buy them in time for this attack.

It would also lose many of its advantages. Bicoin transfers are peer to peer the transaction could take place between a cell phone bitcoin client and a store by having the client connect directly to the stores client, instant transfer.  Even more as the number of people running the bitcoin client goes up the faster transactions get. The only advantage that bitcoin cannot emulate is chargebacks. And it's questionable whether or not that alone will be enough to justify a third party, along with the loss of anonymity and direct control over your money.

No, by no means the best way at all.

The simplified payment verification is a light node, it does not verify any transactions other than its own and it requires supernodes to confirm transactions for it and process any and all transactions out side of its range of interest which includes only its own bitcoins, it would be like bringing the current Bitcoin network down to 1000 peers that did all the confirming and propagating while everyone else just sent them transactions, it would work but i would prefer to expand the interest of a headers only client to a larger section of the block chain so that transaction confirmation and propagation is not solely in the hands of those few supernodes. 
@_date: 2011-05-23 23:03:01
But you can spend them with a new address, an address that is in no way linked to the one at which you received the coins. The only way for them to make the connection would be an oddly specific amount of coins (which could be avoided by multiple transactions instead of just one) or by having your wallet file (at which point your screwed anyways).
@_date: 2011-08-02 00:10:54


yes it does, but it does this by slowing down coins when they have been transferred an inordinate amount of times in recent history. The problem with applying this to small transactions is that 1 BTC = 100000000 Santioshi, thats a lot of transactions before they have to resend the same coins.  


Is the protocol salable to that level? Yes, but there is a **ton** of work to be done before that point, right now the network would be crushed under the weight of that many small transactions fairly quickly. But once block chain trimming is implemented the client will delete old transactions from the block chain, meaning spam will delete it self when it transfers around making chain spamming impossible, combine this with more effective block chain downloading to allow for larger blocks (re-broadcast transactions instead of the entire block, set up client so that they package blocks on their local system instead of downloading a copy)  and finally a good implementation of a headers only client, a headers only client does not store the entire block chain, it only stores and confirms sections of the block chain it wants to, that way as the block chain grows to be larger than 500gigs or so clients can chose to help the network by confirming transactions from a small section only.


As explained above, you where not lied to, its just a complex program and system that requires a good amount of work before it is ready for main stream. The protocol is not done yet, alternate clients will have to implement these protocol upgrades themselves or copy the official implementation. This is why i am very very glad we are in a lull, we need the time to finish the protocol. Most of these changes are local (meaning they dont require the entire network to upgrade and they can be implemented by one client without affecting other clients) so we may see them in alternate clients first. (for example Bitcoinj a client coded by a google employee is the first headers only client)

Double spending is only possible when one person/group has more than 50% of the hashing power, it should not be difficult at all to build a system that monitors the network and stops operating when one entity has more than half the hashing power.

No 'laws' in the traditonal sense, no arbitary regulations or rules. No one would make laws or enforce them. The only thing enforced would be rights, a right to life, liberty, and property would be the only 'laws' in existance. 
Your taking a more minarchist position, defining the goverment as a protector of rights and as i said i have no issue with that. 
If you care to define goverment as a protective entitey that enforces laws or rights, then what i am propoing is not anarchy, but insted many many compeating goverments each offering protection services as well as other goverment functions to their customers. You are told how dangerous monopolies are when they are on steel or rare earth metals, but Goverment (as we deine it, and as it currently exists) is a monopoly on force, meaning that they claim a right to rule every person in a generall area and enforce whatever rules they wish , while preventing anyone from compeating with them and demadning payment from every person who lives there, its a protection racket "pay us and we wont come and take your stuff and or take you".  Moopolies become corrupt, slow, and unable to provide a good product, take a look at goverments and tell me they dont show all the symptoms. 
We propose that no man has a right to rule over another man, no matter if he is part of that magical majority that democracy says excuses tyrany. The people make the rights, and in this case the rights are as old as time itself, life,liberty, and property. That is what these 'goverments' as you wish to call them will enforce, there will be no more laws, no restrictive edicts deciding what you can or can not do, only protection of your freedom.

Its not a controlling authority, Alerts do not control your client in any way other than the message, and alerts can be disabled if you do not wish to receive them. Its a centralized warning system, that can do nothing but warn you about things, it has no control over anyone's coins or clients. 
Now to clarify what alerts do, they sign a message with the key and it is spread peer to peer to every client, and the clients show this message every time they start up until the alert is removed. But it does not have the power to stop anyone form using Bitcoin, the code can be removed in seconds and does nothing but nag you with a message (you can even disable alerts if you want to). Its designed to alert people in case of a security flaw or a 51% attack. But it has no control over your coins or your client.

Actually the lowest bitcoin denomination is 1/100000000 so you would not have problems untill the USD/BTC exchange rate was $10000000 a coin (that would mean that the minimum divisable bitcoin unit would be equal to 1 cent)   
I understand why deflation is a problem for physical currency (bars of gold or gold dust is the idea you where talking about) but bitcoin is not physical, the numbers do not matter as long they dont exceed the 8 decimal limit.

Mining is supposed to end one day anyways a QC miner would just do it very quickly. 
As for changing the keys (you really cant make the mining algorythm QC proof without ending mining) you would have to have a trusted party take the current chain and sign it, then sent out an update to the bitcoin client with the newly encrypted chain built in with the new encryption method, the new encryption method would be activated when a certin block was mined, inbetween relese and the mining of this trigger-block you would need near universal adoption becuase when the trigger block is mined the networks will become seprate and all the users not upgraded will be unable to trade with anyone on the new network or excange their old network bitcoins for new network bitcoins, probamatic yes impossible no.

And an even larger portion of the dollars rest with a small portion of wealthy.


To the contrary, adoption has happened, you can **buy** things with the current bitcoins, they are accepted in quite a few places and recognized by quite a few people. Bitcoin made it over the hump where people began to perceive it as valuable when exchanges came into existence, any other digital currency based on it would have the stigma of a copy cat and lack the enthusiastic and capable user base that makes, and is still making, Bitcoin possible and viable. 


It would not kill Bitcoin, there is no one true currency, take a look for a moment at all the people here whining about the coin limit and the inefficiencies of mining, do you see any other block chains or clients? Nope not a single competing Bitcoin based currency. Its much harder than you think it is to make a new client and then find support for it. Santioshi's solution to decentralized money is pure genius, i dont think anyone can top it technically for a long time to come, as such the only changes that could be made in a new type of Bitcoin would be of an economic nature and as such they would not be universally agreed upon or adopted.

Your talking about mining, mining has to do with transaction processing and your right it is by design very resource intensive. But the phones do not have to mine, they send their transactions to the miners. With the advent of headers-only clients (which contrary to the OP, have been implemented) phones can escape the storage intensive task of storing the block chain, and the processing intensive task of confirming transactions (confirming transactions is not mining, but anyone with a copy of the block chain does it, the phone does not have a copy of the block chain and it does not confirm). Thanks to these improvements even lower end android devices can run the current android Bitcoin client perfectly (i have Bitcoin running on a 600mhz tablet with 256 mb of ram, it runs just as smooth as anything else)

I suppose you could also let your "medium nodes" require a proof of work from each other before accepting a validation claim, to prevent an attacker from flooding the network with malicious nodes. But then what is the incentive for the good nodes to do this proof of work?
Your missing the in between, nodes do not mine, they do not have proof of work, nodes decide what transactions should be included in the next block by propagating transactions through the network and deciding what is valid and what is not valid using their copy of the block chain. We are not getting into proof of work here, that's for miners, the discussion on nodes is about who propagates transactions and decides what goes in the next block. Right now every node is a full node, it accepts transactions confirms it against its own local copy of the block chain and then propagates them for submission into a block. With supernodes only the super nodes and the client sending the nodes would be able to submit the transaction for inclusion in a block. With medium nodes there would be more than just supernodes capable of confirming that the transaction should be come part of a block, and more than just supernodes to accept or reject new blocks. Before blocks can be made and sent throught the network the transactions first need to be sent throughout the network, i am proposing a system that would allow less powerfull machines to take part in deciding what should be included in the next block.

So to do this you would need to set a arbitrary block generation point (lets say block n) when the network reached the block before block n (blocks contain all the transactions since the last block, blocks showing the transaction of money to a certain address are accepted as proof that a person owns certain bitcoins) the people trying to return lost bitcoins would have to send a transaction to transfer the lost BTC back to its owners, the problem is that they are not the actually owners of the BTC according to the system (the wallet with they key was lost and only that wallet can be the owner of those coins) so anyone that is not part of the group trying to restore the bitcoins will not confirm the transaction, unless the transaction is accepted as valid by more than 51% of the network anyone trying to make a block with that transaction included will have their block rejected. 
Having the devs code this would cause an uproar, there is no way to tell if the people coming forward are the actual owners, of if the coins they are pointing to are actually lost or if they are just being horded. If anyone tried to code something like this in their client would be abandoned overnight. If people did it themselves, well then it would be under a microscope, you could not even get most people using bitcoin to take a second look at it without proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that these people actually owned the bitcoins they are trying to collect (this is impossible due to the nature of bitcoin, and the fact that the only possible proof, the wallet, has been lost). Any attempt to do this would be more seen as theft than anything else. Maybe in 100 years people will look around for coins that have not been moved for a lifetime and then they will be confident that they are abandoned wallets that they can restore without theft.

You did not **have** to, you can disable transaction fees for now. In the future though it will be needed if you want your transaction confirmed in a timely manner.

Currencies with "intrinsic value" are vastly overrated. Food and shelter are the only two things with inherent value to every human being, but they are not easily traded. Gold works well as a currency not because it has intrinsic value, its intrinsic value is tiny! to 99% of the population gold is totally worthless except as a medium of trade. Gold is a very nearly useless scarce token, Bitcoin is a useless scare token with the benefit of being indestructible and unstealable with the right knowledge, as well as making non physical transfers very simple and secure.

At the current rate of development a super computer in 50 years may be able to crack a single bitcoin key with 1000 years of calculations. Even more importantly the hashing algorithm used is resistant to quantum computing (aka quantum computers are not much better than regular ones for cracking the keys) as such not even a quantum computer could crack a bitcoin key with less than 100 years of sustained effort within our lifetimes. I dont know what other flaws you have, but the cryptography is not one of them. 
Edit: I did the math, 
To crack sha-256 you need 2^256 attempts, at the current speed of the entire bitcoin network (the fastest super computer in the world) it would take 3.7x1056 years, even if the worlds fastest super computer is a hundred trillion times more powerful in 50 years it would still take 2x105 years. If it is 1000 trillion times more powerful it will still take 22180 years. Sha-256 is quantum resistant meaning that quantum computers are not nearly as much faster at cracking it as they are with other formulas , assuming that the quantum computer is on par with a super computer 1000 trillion times more powerful than today's bitcoin network (it will be a very very long time before quantum computing develops this much), it would take 221 years.

Dont keep your wallet where you host your website, you can just have the address posted and use the block explorer to confirm payment. When you need to remove funds from your wallet just mount it on a secure machine, even if the server is compromised they will not have your wallet and since you only mount it on a secure machine separate from the server they dont even know their target.

This is true, but you and i have different definitions of wide spread, today's little rollercoster was less dramatic (both in dollars change and percentage of variance) than previous such corrections, and it comes on the heels of weeks of incredible stability, even at one point being more stable than the dollar for a day. Bitcoin is becoming more stable, it may not seem like it now, but these upsets are becoming less dramatic and the periods between more stable. As Bitcoin becomes more stable more people will adopt, which will create more stability, its just going to take some time and a whole lot of development for ease of use and adoption (which is underway full time, it will just be a few months before we see results).

The tasks nodes need to perform are not diverse, the areas of the block chain are. Some coins have lots of traffic and a home computer could only handle a very small portion of a high traffic set of coins. Here are enough sections of the blockchain that assigning a section that is best suited for a computers specs would be easy. The problem is assigning the tasks, how do you keep track of who is responsible for what? How do you ensure that you don't leave sections of the chain abandoned and others with an overabundance of nodes? And how do you manage all this without centralization?

You work for you money, and you work for it on the premise that it is a store of value, that the money you receive for your work today can be used to buy something of equal value tomorrow. You pay your taxes and save money for your family. Have you ever stopped to think about your money? You have heard of inflation, and you know that money was a lot more valuable when you where a child but you never made the connection. You trust your government to maintain and control the dollar but you never stopped to think what it means when the government prints more money, you never stopped to think that when they print money the steal the value of your work right out of your bank accounts, your kids collage funds, and even the bills in your pocket. Taxation without representation is theft, where is your vote on when the government can print more money and siphon value away from every person who holds a dollar?
Bitcoin is a currency designed to put your money back in your hands, no government, no tracking, no Banks, just you for the first time in your life having money that is truly yours to make or break. 
But Bitcoin is fake money you say? every time you use a credit card or debit card the person accepting the payment has to connect to the internet and tell the bank "user x is removing $8 from their account" and the bank changes their records (thats for debit for i know credit works by adding to a balance) the bank's record of your account is just a number, nothing stopping them from setting it to 0 or to 10000000 its just a double value in a program, it does not know or care if that money actually exists or was just made up. Bitcoins would work like debit cards except the money would be "real" instead of just a number on a server totally disconnected with any "real" dollars, it would be confirmed to exist by the entire bitcoin network, no one could just set your balance to 1000000, and you would manage it instead of the bank. You use "fake" money every day, why not use "fake" money that you control and you know is actually tied to a unit of currency?

When you own land you dont own the air that moves through it, you own that area and as such anyone affecting its condition with their property (in this case smog) is violating your right to that area. For example two people own different sections of a river, upstream there is a factory pumping muck into the river, downstream the second property owner fishes or boats on his section of river, the muck damages the fish and the plants and generally destroys his section of the river, neither party owns the water, but they do own their section and polluting that section violates their rights in the same way that taking a wrecking ball to your home would violate your property rights and require restitution, neither takes anything from you (your hose is still there, just in pieces, the river is still there its just dirty and useless, your house is still there you just cant breath there) but you have a right to decide what happens to your property and pollution violates that.

Oh another thing I just realized, bitcoin uses the processing power from the mining network to make ever more complex hashes (that's where the extra processing power goes when the difficulty goes up) a QC mining rig would raise the difficulty to the power of that QC and from there on in it would make QC proof hashes for the network not only would a QC not mine all the bitcoins in a day it would make them much much more secure with quantam generated hashes.

They are trying to reverse solve a hash for a random number (the "nonce") you can only reverse solve hashes through brute force, so they are trying thousands of different combinations in hope of stumbling onto the correct answer, the problem is made more complicated every so many blocks to keep the rate of block generation at or near 6 blocks an hour. Each block represents a large amount of computational effort and as such it requires a greater amount of computational effort to preform malicious acts on the network. 
@_date: 2011-07-06 12:06:00
Actually, any organization that wanted to preform a double spend attack (even with 50%+ they can only mess with transactions that are going on then, nothing can be done to the history) would need 11 tera hashes worth of computing power, as we have all heard that is more than the worlds top 500 super computers could do if they all teamed up, so they would need to go the graphics card route, thats means 15200 6990's at a cost of  11 million dollars for the cards alone,  another 3.6 million on the cases, power supply's, motherboards processors and ram. Plus assembly costs, the cost for a facility, and there you have it for about 18 million dollars you could get 51% of the network. Why am i not worried about this? Simple they would have to spend significantly more to get enough of the network to overpower the new miners flowing in every day, and even more the parts they need are not available in those quantities, even if they where to start seizing 6990's it would take them months to build up enough, and by that time they would need even more.  Their target is always moving, can not be limited by the law of one nation and will respond to any attempted takeover with even more hashing power. The difficulty is not the money, its actually getting the parts in large enough quantities and putting them to use before the hashing power goes up again and they need even more cards.

There is an alternative to Super Nodes. The headers only clients that you hear about (the ones that you can run without the block chain) they work by only downloading the section of the block chain containing the coins in your wallet and then only confirming transactions from that particular section. So even a partial client confirms transactions and such exactly like a full or super node would except in a very small scope. 
But headers only clients can choose the sections of the block chain they want to confirm, right now they just choose the very small sections containing the coins in the users wallet. But there is nothing stopping this scope from being expanded. A headers only client could expand its interest to a decent chunk (lets say 100gb) of the block chain, then it would proceed to confirm transactions from exactly that 100gb, because its only working with that small section the number of TPS is more than reasonable for a home computer to confirm. Also, once the Bitcoin network scales to that point whole blocks will not be shared between clients but instead clients will download the header and then the individual transactions in the block so that they can package it locally and download the transactions from multiple sources. Meaning that a headers only client is more than capable of allowing others to download its section of the block chain. 
I propose that desktop clients, once they become headers only, by default uses a small amount of the users hard drive (lets say 10 gigs, but the user can bump that up) and confirm a small amount of the block chain. That way if the Block chain is 100gb every 10 home clients would act like one super node. This keeps the network honest and ensures that responsibility for the block chain and confirmation is not solely on Super nodes. 
tl;dr Headers only clients can choose what sections of the block chain they confirm, make them choose bigger sections, have lots of them confirming smaller sections, together they can confirm any transaction. And hold the entire block chain.

The longest chain is a simple way to say the chain with the most proof of work an expression we devised for explaining this part of the network to non techies . So long as one peer has the chain with the most work the network can not accept any chain with a  lower value.  What's even more, no client will ever come with a block chain, it will always be hosted by the network,  hosting it yourself is pointless since its constantly changing,   it also acts as a mile high red flag that this is trying to be done. No matter what the client, if it tries to use a different chain than the main network it will simply not be able to interact at all with the main network, thus turning it into a fork.

People worked for years and years harvesting grain with a scythe, then someone sat down, though about it for a little while and built the mechanical reaper that did much more work in much less time with much less effort. Each of the men with a scythe contributed only a few meals to society, the man who invented the mechanical reaper brought grain prices down, more people could eat and allowed the countless hours that used to be spend harvesting to be spend on other productive tasks. The inventor contributed more to humanity with one invention than every one of the harvesters and their years of labor. Reality rewards thought and productivity not blind effort, it is fair in that at every moment you have a choice to think, to try and invent, create and contribute to humanity just as much as that man did.


Oh yes that wealth, the wealth produced by the contributions of all those "greedy barons" the wealth created by their genius? Wealth is not gold, it is not dollars neither will transform into the food you need to eat or the building you need for shelter, wealth is the ability to create, money is meant as a token of that ability and it only holds value when people like those tycoons are willing to back it with their productive ability. Go ahead steal all of the wealth, see how much that dollar bill is worth without anyone backing it.   


what i am proposing is a society where you are free to do as you will, you can go and form your little socialist party with others that agree with you, do it on your own land with your own funds and i have no right to stop you. What i am proposing is a system in which every human being has a right to his life and is allowed to do with it what he wills so long as he does not infringe on another's right to do so, if he wants to make a socialistic utopia, by all means. We do not ask that you agree with us, or that you live like us, we simply want to be left alone, allowed to live and create on our own terms (as we will allow you to live and create on your own terms) without any group, government or body demanding that we give up our rights and our lives "for the greater good". Fascism requires force, there is no force involved here, money can only be used in trade not as a tool of force, you always have a choice to accept it or not, and it is always within you rights to walk away and do things on your own terms, All we ask is to be allowed to create without your interference. (after all if your so sure we need regulation let us fail and allow reality to teach us our lesson)

Nope, no matter how high the difficulty, there will always be three groups that stay in this scenario.
1) The miners who get their electricity free, they don't have to meet electric costs, and any mining is more profitable than none, this represents a pretty good chunk of miners.
2) Those who keep running for the promise of huge rewards once the difficulty goes down, mining during the high difficulty period may not be profitable, but it becomes insanely so at the new lower difficulty. Hence they would stay on just to be the first on the high profit bandwagon, there they would recoup their costs and make a larger profit.    
3) The real Bitcoin loyalists and die-hards, they are not making a profit, but they are doing their mining for the network, so that Bitcoin will survive, not necessarily for the profit. 
If anyone of these 3 groups stay it will be enough to get us over the hump, and i am inclined to say all of them will.

While this argument may hold up when your talking about immediate emergency procedures, but those procedures are a small fraction of the medicine practiced, the vast majority of surgery's are not emergency but planned to prevent one ( i need open heart surgery in the next year, i will wait an extra month for the cheaper/better service), if emergency "perversely high demand" procedures made up more than a small fraction of the procedures done then maybe your point would have merit.

First of all bitbills are not single-use they can be traded forever until someone needs the bitcoins they hold back in physical form. If you are using large denominations they could give you change in bitbills, and what they can not do for exact change can be sent to your home wallet by the cash register. As for giving cards back, i would assume that any system where bitbills worked large scale would involve a business holding enough bitbills to give you change.
Having to have the private key stored by anyone no matter how much you may trust them is just not a good idea, have a credit card that works exactly as they do today, but instead of paying your bill in dollars you just send your payment in Bitcoins to an address. That way there is no need to trust a centralized system with your private key and you get to pay with plastic, but you lose the anonymity advantage. I like BitBills because they keep all the advantages of Bitcoins while being physically trade able.

This is a common misconception, if you have the full block chain (right now everyone) you can verify a transaction yourself instantly, and even if you dont have the full block chain you will receive verification from peers that do have the full block chain in seconds. The 10 minute wait is just to make it official. 
TL;DR Transactions are verified almost instantly, blocks just make it official.

Remember, transactions spread through the network, so transferring coins would still be possible, you would just have to wait longer to spend them again (the needed 6 block confirmation) as long as there is even a fraction of the current power pointed at the network it will continue to operate, even if it is slower it would not stop the network entirely. Another thing to keep in mind is that Bitcoin mining can happen in any country, unless the crackdown is world wide there would still be miners to keep the network going. 


That will be over soon enough, once merged mining gets going later this year the Namecoin difficulty will match the Bitcoin difficulty.

No, things are not given value because of the effort required to create them, i could put years and years of effort into finger paintings, but that would not make them valuable or useful in the slightest, the value of an object is decided by demand, the effort required to produce the product is a factor, but is not the cause. Gold is "worth" many times the cost of the labor required to obtain it, it is given this extra value by demand. Effort does not create value, demand does, and practicality is the most reliable creator of demand, but by no means the only one. 
Now that we have that cleared up, back to my point, the current bureaucratic system of fiat money is much more inefficient and wasteful than Bitcoin mining will ever be.

ok, now i see, sorry for being a little think headed.

Using merged mining you submit your hash to both networks at once, so if you have one card running at 200 m/hases you could use merged mining to mine with 200 m/hashes on the Bitcoin network and mine with 200 m/hashes on the Namecoin network. Thus you get twice the work out of the same card.

not your fault, i should have specified where i got those numbers.


to download 5tb. You're up over 11 days if you can saturate half of your connection, and you're up to your full month if you make any sort of real assumptions (download + upload, realistic average download and upload speeds).
And you're looking at a heck of unhappy provider with the right to terminate your connection at any time.
My point is, I don't think Comcast is going to be happy allowing you to run 5TB/month no matter what plan you're on, and you're going to need to get a fiber connection to run that much data.
My point is that web hosting companies and the like regularly use this much data, as do most large companies. Rewind 8 years and we could be having the same conversation about how no one would be able to watch hd movies on hulu without having their provider cut them off for using too much bandwidth. Internet speeds and caps vary widely, in some countries you would have no problem getting a fast connection and using that much bandwidth, nodes are not limited to one country, but even then at the rate fiber is being rolled out and internet speeds are going up i really dont think it will present too much of a problem, considering that the rise in traffic will be gradual as more people use bitcoin we dont even have to worry about surprising the ISP's and overloading them. Sure most people will move to a bitcoin partial node but real nodes will not be the exception but the rule for most businesses.

I actually had the exact same idea but i abandoned it after realizing that storing the .dat on the card was too risky , the problem with having the keys on the card is that anyone who as access to the card even for a second can get the private key off of the cards wallet and then they have unfettered access not only now but in the future. The only way to do Bitcoin debit securely would be for the card to hold a user id (not a .dat) that would be used to access the credit server that would then send the payment, this of course is a little centralized for my tastes but i do think it would work well and that its advantages may be worth it.   
@_date: 2011-05-25 10:20:35
Yes it would result in inflation for a while but once the 990 get into the market (they will not become more valuable if they hold them, the value of bitcoins would drop as soon as they mined them) so the coins would be released into the market and life would go on. From what i understand about the bitcoin formula a QC would mine huge amounts of bitcoins for a little while then the network difficulty would shoot up to match it so that only one block every 10 minutes would be mined (its doing this now and it has made mining unprofitable to get into) , it does not matter how much power you have the difficulty goes up to match and return the generation to 1 block every ten minutes. A QC would not generate the rest of the coins overnight, it would just get a monopoly on mining (since no one else would have a snowballs chance in hell with the new difficulty).  
@_date: 2011-05-31 23:24:04

All of this is based on the assumption that mining power consumption will not continue to get more efficient over time, take a look at the power efficency difference of GPU vs CPU mining, ASIC mining is coming up fast, and it will drop the power consumption of the Bitcoin network by a factor of 10 at the very least.
And more importantly (and interestingly) why is this a bad thing? This creates a huge demand for the cheapest cleanest energy possible. Flocks of Bitcoin miners looking for cheap electricity could help jump start clean energy projects previously lacking in demand, whats even better Bitcoin mining will push power efficiency in electronics like never before, where most power efficiency work today involves turning things off when not in use the advancements made for Bitcoin would be one reducing consumption while everything worked full steam, the power savings that could bring to every electronic device on earth could be monumental. If anything Bitcoin will drive much needed innovation in the energy market that we have been lacking for years.

Currently both of those options are slower and more expensive then graphics card mining, the advantage they have is power consumption. But a takeover needs raw power, not efficiency. 


That would inspire massive interest in bitcoin, and even with total control over production you can not retool factories overnight, so it would still take time.

Using NFC tap and pay with a cell phone is totally possible. And i think it would be possible to create a debit card like solution, the card would have its public key printed on the front (so that you could send money to it) and the private key would be inside the mag strip on the back, you would slide it through the reader which would pull up the balance of the card and transfer the correct amount to the seller. Of course such a system would need to be carefully designed as it could store your private key and have access to any coins you put onto the card in the future.

What your talking about is the myth of the "Deflationary problem" , which states that if currency rises in value people will horde all of their money and the economy will collapse as people never spend it. 
If we assume your right then we assume that people are acting in a perfectly rational matter with their money, because they know it will buy more later they do not spend it now. So lets apply the same idea to an inflationary currency, if people know their money will only decrease in value they will spend it as fast as they can hoping to leave anyone else holding it as the value of their labor is drained away. It also encourages debt, in so much that you can spend money when its more valuable and pay it back with less value. Hmm... massive debt .... inflationary currency, why does that sound so familiar?   
So if people act rationally with their currency then there is just as much of a problem with inflationary currency as their is with deflationary currency. But to go even further i can prove that people will not wait to buy, even if they know that their money will be more valuable in the future. The entire electronics and computer industry, there prices are massively deflationary, by your assumption if the unit of value that money can buy goes up over time everyone will just hoard and wait to buy. Why then do people buy electronics at all? By your assumption people would not buy electronics at all, they would wait until they where cheaper. But they don't. Deflationary money does not cause people to hoard and wait to buy for the same reasons and in the same way the constantly cheaper devices in the electronics industry do not keep people from buying computers.  
Whats even more Bitcoin is not going to be the 1 world currency. Deflation requires new people to move into the market, and that no one will put some old coins on the market. As such even once all the coins are mined there will be no guaranteeing  deflation, after that it works like any other commodity, you don't need to prevent the hoarding of stocks or commodity's because they may go down or up in value. Bitcoin will be the same way.  


Because no one will support it (early adopters had the promise of huge profits for their support in the beginning of Bitcoin, how are you going to attract supporters?), calculation the proper rate of inflation is impossible, and because there is no one in your camp knowledgeable enough to code their own client.

If large entities where interested in Bitcoin (in a positive way) then this would hold more merit. As it is we will probably have to walk up and slap them in the face with it to even get large companies/ organizations to acknowledge it as something more than drug money/funny money.
The Bitcoin protocol is pure genius, major technical improvements will most likely not be forthcoming. Therefore the only advantages a separate chain could have would be opinion based and therefor not attractive to most current Bitcoin users. If a large company creates its own chain it could only succeed based upon the backing of the store, but by the time such a thing is even looked at Bitcoin would have to be already largely accepted, thus removing any incentive to move to 'Walmart coins'.  Some nations could implement their own coin, and that may be slightly more successful, but Bitcoin would remain for the nations that did not. 
Of course that is just protocol development, there are quite a few closed source websites and systems that have sprung up to work with Bitcoin, and as we have learned a protocol alone is not enough. Any group wanting to compete would have to offer something better, when they could not even take half of Bitcoins services with them how do they make it 'better' at all?

This goes in [@_date: 2011-08-23 21:23:31
You don't fully understand the Bitcoin protocol. This is why we have mining, mining creates proof of work, this allows Bitcoin to look at a chain and confirm how much effort was put into creating it, no change can be made to the block chain without invalidating this proof of work. This is why you need 51% of the total processing power not 51% of the total clients, even if 100% of Bitcoin clients downloaded and tried to use the false block chain they would switch to the real one instantaneously unless that false block chain had more processing power put into creating it than the regular Bitcoin block chain, that means the false block chain would require more power than the Bitcoin network going for the same or longer amount of time. 51% attacks work by adding false blocks onto the existing chain, and since they have the most processing power, they create the chain with the most proof of work that is then accepted by the network, the farther you go back trying to change blocks the more impossible it becomes. 
Whats even more, you never download the block chain from a centralized source, the Bitcoin network is the only place to get the block chain, and any connection to it (for reasons listed above) will instantly break a false block chain. You can not fake a chain. 
You really think Santioshi did not fix a glaring flaw like this? Everyone could do decentralized money that way, it just would not be secure at all, the proof of work system is what made genius and safe from attacks like this.

There is an alternative to Super Nodes. The headers only clients that you hear about (the ones that you can run without the block chain) they work by only downloading the section of the block chain containing the coins in your wallet and then only confirming transactions from that particular section. So even a partial client confirms transactions and such exactly like a full or super node would except in a very small scope.
But headers only clients can choose the sections of the block chain they want to confirm, right now they just choose the very small sections containing the coins in the users wallet. But there is nothing stopping this scope from being expanded. A headers only client could expand its interest to a decent chunk (lets say 100gb) of the block chain, then it would proceed to confirm transactions from exactly that 100gb, because its only working with that small section the number of TPS is more than reasonable for a home computer to confirm. Also, once the Bitcoin network scales to that point whole blocks will not be shared between clients but instead clients will download the header and then the individual transactions in the block so that they can package it locally and download the transactions from multiple sources. Meaning that a headers only client is more than capable of allowing others to download its section of the block chain.
I propose that desktop clients, once they become headers only, by default use a small amount of the users hard drive (lets say 10 gigs, but the user can bump that up) and confirm a small amount of the block chain, this keeps bandwith, processor and storage space reasonable and scalable to whatever the computer can handle or the user feels comfortable with. If every user confirms 10gigs of the Block chain and it  is 100gb in size every 10 home clients would act like one super node. This keeps the network honest and ensures that responsibility for the block chain and confirmation is not solely on Super nodes.
tl;dr Headers only clients can choose what sections of the block chain they confirm, make them choose bigger sections, have lots of them confirming smaller sections, together they can confirm any transaction. And hold the entire block chain.

The only purpose of physical representations of bitcoins like BitBills is so that transactions can take place without the buyer having a cell phone with a Bitcoin client or a dedicated mobile Bitcoin client device. As such making the transaction without a mobile device or physical representation would require them to go home pay for the items and then come back, sending change home does not require them to have a Bitcoin capable device on them, which is exactly what BitBills, bit credit, or bit debit are all trying to achieve, the ability to make a transaction in Bitcoin without the buyer having to have anything electronic on them during the transaction (with the added benefit of instant transaction confirmation) is the reason for the existence of all of these the question is who can do it best.

They would not be able to make the transactions fast enough to cause serious problems, even if they just tossed .0000001 bitcoins between a bunch of different people a transaction that small cant have a transfer fee and would take an hour or more getting to its destination, without paying transfer fees the attack simply would not be fast enough to cause trouble, and if they did pay transfer fees then the amount of coins they would use to attack would atrophy into nothing. Simply put it would be a lot of time, trouble, and money for them to preform this attack and the result would be a whole 200mb more on the list, not enough to cause any sort of damage, but it would have the positive effect of encouraging development of a client that only needs a partial transaction list. The transaction list may take a little longer to download but that is a far cry from crippling bitcoin.

The remaining btc are more than enough for trade, money is not power it does not give them "control" over people or over Bitcoin, they could in theory have a fire sale and mess with the Bitcoin exchange rate, but they can only do that once, after that the money is diffuse. In the very early days Bitcoin required knowledge and skill, without that knowledge, skill, and backing Bitcoins would be worth nothing. Do not begrudge them their wealth they helped make Bitcoins valuable and their effort made it possible for us to use them today. A ever shrinking portion of the total number of Bitcoins is a small price to pay for the existence of Bitcoin.

If your machine is compromised it simply has to wait for you to type the password and keylog it, its that simple. Yes encryption does provide some protection, but that protection is unrelated to the virtual machine, as you have the exact same protection and the exact same weakness without it in this case. 


You... do understand that to run any sort of program or virtual machine the host **must** have full access to everything. There is no getting around this, no avoiding this, and no stopping this. You dont understand how operating systems, much less virtulization works.

that would only be if he was 51% by total volume of bitcoin clients operating, not bitcoin miners. Your confusing double spending attacks with the main network, if you have 51% or the mining capability you can start new chains and spend bitcoins twice (no profit motive for this you would not be able to double spend more than you would mine normally you would probably get less, the only reason to do this would be to discredit bitcoin). On the other hand if you control 51% of all bitcoin clients (mining or otherwise) then you can transfer all the money to yourself. 
This is my understanding please correct me if this is wrong.

Is there any way to setup a client that would automatically delete obsolete parts of the block chain? Once we have that done i think we could keep it under 20tb. And while this is problematic we have to take into account hardware improvements. With my machine right now i could very nearly meet these requirements, and for about $1500  you can build a machine right now that meets these requirements (16gigs ram, 12tb storage, ssd, 3ghz quad core, add a higher tier internet service and your good). Thats not a huge barrier for entry now, much less in a few years when storage will be larger, internet  faster, and parts cheaper. I can understand that even despite advancements there will be a relatively small number of people confirming transactions but that is not in the range of hundreds or thousands but in the range of hundreds of thousands (maybe even a million), and i can live with that.
Edit: Remove the ssd, add another 3tb drive and raid 0 all 5 drives, that should give better than ssd speeds and more storage.

Where does my comment imply suddenly, its gradual, as the number of bitcoins grows the money put into the system is divided among every bitcoin, the more bitcoins the less that money effects the value because there are more to go around. This will happen gradually, combine it with exchanges that can wire money quickly between each other (to better allow arbitrage) and merchants accepting bitcoins on the average price instead of the day to day price (much much more stable) and bitcoin can gradually become more stable to the point where even its day to day fluctuations are acceptable for trade.

@_date: 2011-06-08 17:00:46
no one can tell the origin ip address of a transaction. There is not discernible difference between a transaction being passed on by to you by a peer and a transaction that originated from your peer. As such you can know the ip addresses of your peers, and what transactions are going through them, but as they transfer a lot more than 1 transaction to you there is no way to know whose transaction is whose or where it started.

Bitcoin does not need to be running for you to receive a transaction, your wallet does not contain your Bitcoins, it has a set of keys that allow you to "unlock" the bitcoins associated with your address. The next time your wallet comes on line it will download the rest of the block list and "unlock" the new coins sent to your address. Once you have a backup of your wallet you can keep sending funds to it forever, you only need to update your backup after you send money (every 100 times you send coins is the threshold but i would suggest you backup after 50) if you dont you might lose some coins. 
The best way to do things is to have two wallets, a local wallet and a savings wallet, your local wallet should contain a small amount of funds. Your savings wallet would be an encrypted file backed up on dropbox, a cd buried in your yard, a flash drive in a safe etc. You would send funds to your savings wallet and keep only an amount you where willing to lose in your local wallet. When you needed to remove money from your savings wallet you would fine a secure machine (one that you know is safe) mount the savings wallet and then spend your coins. You should probably keep a backup of your local wallet as well, but that backup does not need to be nearly as through. 
As for old wallet.dat's stored by automated backups, they are just fine so long as the backup is encrypted, otherwise they present a security risk.
Just ask if i failed to clarify anything here.
@_date: 2011-06-06 13:33:57

To crack sha-256 you need 2^256 attempts, at the current speed of the entire bitcoin network (the fastest super computer in the world) it would take 3.7x10^56 years, even if the worlds fastest super computer is a hundred trillion times more powerful in 50 years it would still take 2x10^5  years.  If it is 1000 trillion times more powerful it will still take 22180 years. Sha-256 is quantum resistant meaning that quantum computers are not nearly as much faster at cracking it as they are with other formulas , assuming that the quantum computer is on par with a super computer 1000 trillion times more powerful than today's bitcoin network (it will be a very very long time before quantum computing develops this much), it would take 221 years. 


Have division problems gotten easier since the beginning of time? Nope, we can just do them faster, and as i proved above, even doing them a lot faster would be nearly pointless. 


It would be worse than that, they could just go on block explorer, find an address with a lot of bitcoins, crack the key, and then spend those coins. Of course as i proved above, the cracking part might take a while.

Its not, we eventually reach the point of diminishing returns on security where we put more and more effort into it for less and less extra security back. I think this is that point. You could make a read-only flash drive (special hardware is not cheap, but this is not too difficult) that has a read-write chip for wallet storage, it would be faster than the CD and simpler to use, the point is that there is a limit to the amount of security a regular user can understand and use, and i think that this implementation would maximize the simplicity to security ratio.

Bitcoin can be more anonymous than cash ever could be, you just have to be careful. For example instead of transferring btc directly to the winner the coins could be laundered and sent to multiple addresses controlled by the winner. Since all of this would be done over tor the server has the luxury of being very hard to trace, in fact it may even be safe to just go ahead and do a single transfer without laundering the site could generate a new address for every donation, and since law enforcement did not have access to the server they would have no way to know who was putting money in, if the server where to randomly launder coins (not just when a job is complete but all the time) then you could keep all of this untraceable. Bitcoins are easier to track than dollars, but if you take the right steps they can be totally anonymous.

With merged mining this simply is not true, using merged mining a single miner can mine on any number of block chains at once with the same performance as if he was mining on only one.

The irony of the statement is that I was thinking about programs like your wallet when I wrote that, the easy to use services are not quite ready yet, but they will be very soon. But there are still quite a few protocol changes needed before bitcoin can handle high transaction volumes. This should take a year at most for both of these issues to be well behind us. And after that things can start to reach critical mass. 
Then again I tend to be conservative in my estimates, and the economy may grow from the tech community before we get into the regular one (which is what I think of as 'prime time' ).

The only known way to manipulate the Bitcoin network is with a 51% attack, this is an attack where one person/group owns 51% or more of the mining power. Deepbit regularly exceeds 51% giving him the opportunity to attempt a attack on the Bitcoin network. Thanks to the nature of pools the 51% attack that Deepbit could do would not really be terrible (people would pull out of the pool the moment he tried, and he would lose the 51% of total hashing speed along with any and all credibility) but the fact remains that allowing any entity to have 51% of the total hashing power for any amount of time is just not good practice. And as such people should mine on other smaller pools to help keep the network secure. 
@_date: 2011-08-24 01:08:02
To actively be able to detect and control Bitcoin traffic over your network you would need deep packet inspection, right now you don't, but supposedly protocol encryption is just a few client revisions away. The sort of blocking and traffic control you propose is possible on a small scale, but try and scale it up and you essentially have to destroy the internet (if they could just detect and block torrenting do you really think it would still be here? Protocol encryption stops that). 
But back to my main point, it would not work, why? You need to make a block, at the correct difficulty. That means that your shop would need to make a block at the current difficulty, your fake nodes would take **years** to do that. He will never see any conformations. Not that that will stop some people, but you could not build your own blockchain in that manner without some serious serious power, and at a pawn shop its more than reasonable for him to wait a few minutes for a confirmation, on that will never come.

The problem is not money, its supply, the demands of the current bitcoin community alone outpace ATI's production speed of high end cards. To get the needed supply would take months on months even if the government intercepted every last high end radeon card built during that period. These cards are manufactured in multiple countries so no single government could capture the entire supply, and if they did it would bring so much attention to bitcoin (United states government seized graphics card factory!) that we would have an influx of new miners that already purchased cards but had not heard about bitcoin. Its a paradox, they can not get the cards they need unless they take over a factory and wait months on months to construct the needed cards, but when they do this they will bring enough new interest to bitcoin that they need even more cards, that take an even longer time to manufacture so they seize more factories which brings more publicity.  The problem is not money its supply, and overcoming that supply problem is very difficult right now, give it a few years and it will be nigh impossible.

Now to clarify what alerts do, they sign a message with the key and it is spread peer to peer to every client, and the clients show this message every time they start up until the alert is removed. but it does not have the power to stop anyone form using Bitcoin, the code can be removed in seconds and does nothing but nag you with a message (you can even disable alerts if you want to). Its designed to alert people in case of a security flaw or a 51% attack. But it has no control over your coins or your client.

Now, this is the feature that will make Bitcoins easier to use in stores than even cash. Just tap your phone on a pad next to the register and viola, your phone sets out the right amount and all you have to do is press send. It would be even better if the client could transmit the transaction to the stores node directly over NFC that why there would be no delay for the store to see the transaction come up.

5tb is no problem for most server hosters, or even basic business internet, i am not saying everybody will run their own node, but any reasonably sized business will want to and they will be able to without breaking the bank on machine costs or internet costs (the machine costs i can be sure of, the internet costs are for America where for about $100 a month you can get unlimited internet with 10mbs down and 3mbs up).

Ah, but that's the point. Do you think police in any practical number could defend a right to property if everyone thought that there was no right to property? Hell no, they can only enforce rules already accepted by the majority on the dissenters who do not accept them. Property is accepted and defend by the majority of people, and as such the state does not create it, but only follow the will of the majority in enforcing it. 
Whats more any and all of your arguments stating that the state is needed to 'create' property rights can be applied just as effectively to a right to life. As such if a right to property can not exist without the state, no rights can.

Where are you getting the cpu numbers?, The hard drive speed requirements? And more importantly where the hell did you pull 50k out of? The most expensive internet you could get around here is $2400 a year ($200 a month for 150 megabits down 15 megabits up) , and if electricity somehow adds up to 50k then you must have built an incredibly inefficient rig. Most importantly yesterdays super server is todays cheap dell, the severeness of this issue depends entirely on how fast we scale up.

This is true, but the more bitcoins enter the system, and the more people use them for trade the more stable we can get the price. Right now we are in the middle of a speculation rush that may continue for a while yet, but it will end, in the meantime the massive deflation is just growing pains.

in reality, all pollution is a violation of the property rights of others, in that people have a right to their property and polluting the air/water etc of another persons property is violating their right to the property, and in a purely capitalist system any form of pollution would require restitution to the property owners that where effected. As such capitalism discourages pollution if property rights are actually enforced, unfortunately the government has ruled against property rights in this nature and allowed capitalism's natural check on pollution to be removed.

I know this, i probably should have mentioned that medium nodes would also use less bandwidth as well as less storage and CPU, my point was that a medium node could run on any home computer and do as much as it can with the available space CPU and bandwidth. The idea is a node that scales to the computer not a computer that is scaled to be a node. 


Malicious nodes will be dealt with exactly the same way they are now, their confirmations will be rejected be the other people running that section of the block chain. There will be millions of medium nodes and there will be far more than one node running each section of the block chain, and just like today one malicious node will be overridden by a majority vote from the other nodes handling that section of the block chain. In the future not every client will be able to run the whole block chain, this is an alternative to leaving it in the hands of a few thousand supernodes that can handle the bandwidth and hardware costs. Exactly like a lite node would rely on and trust the full nodes to confirm transactions and manage the block chain a medium node would rely on other medium nodes to confirm the rest of the block chain.

@_date: 2011-07-04 14:33:44


Not really


See, you only need to store 27% of all the transactions ever made. The rest can be pruned. As for bandwidth, internet speeds grow every day, and the rate at which transactions come through is 1.6mb a second (assuming 1 gig blocks), most homes get that speed now. If you worry is bandwidth then you are severely underestimating how robust the internet backbone is.

I was wondering as well. Maybe it just plots the location of the peer it receives the data from? Combine that with being well connected and you could get every transaction.

We all reap the benefits of his ancestors ingenuity, every single person in this country has benefited from their creations. The only thing he can do with this money is send it back to someone who deserves it, every penny he spends puts the money back into the hands of someone creating something of value. As much as inheritance may seem unfair it would be evil to deprive the creator of all that wealth of the ability to do with it what he wills.


The public has always started on even footing with those tycoons, the rich can not hog productive ability, it is not something that can be bought it is the result of a human being who strives to create something of value. The productive ability has always been in the hands of the public, for it is not property or wealth that creates productive ability is is the other way around productive ability creates wealth and property, and it is a function of a humans life, a choice to be made, and its not one you can take away. The tycoons are simply the ones who chose to strive for it often starting on even or lesser footing than the public.


This is not the world where every inch of land is owned, by our definition of property you can not own the land until you add something of value to it. So there would be unclaimed land for you to go and build on. The money of "those already rich" is nothing but paper without a government to back it up with force and as such they would not start out too far ahead (not that i would care so long as they where productive). Ah wage slaves, you are not forced to work, if you are not paid a fair price, do not work there, or go on strike. I have no problem with unions or strikes, you have that right. Do not expect to be paid more than you are worth, but you are never forced to accept a penny less than the worth of your effort.    


In control of what? Like i said money is a tool of trade, you can only trade with willing partners, even the richest man on earth has no power if everyone decides not to take his money. It is their choice to do so, money gives you no power over men, it gives you a token to trade with those who create. As for the requirement of force to level the playing field of all wealth stolen by force, well they seem to do a pretty good job of setting up their system to fail, we just need to step out of the way. 


In this world anyone who came to be rich already proved themselves worthy of whatever "power" money gives them. Why is is not fascist? Simple you always have a choice to compete, if you can do it better, if you can make for of a contribution to humanity then you will succeed, the wealthy are not kept that way by force but by fair trade, and they only continue to trade so long as they make the best product, the best contribution. The wealthy can only exist with the publics consent, it is their choice to buy his product, and no one can force them to trade with him, every penny he earns represents the consent of the people that he has produced something worth their effort and that he should continue doing so. You can not create a society among 5 rich people, they are put in power by the publics consent to buy their product, and once the public realizes this the world will be much much better off.


And you can go off and do that, its your right, but we have our right to our lives and we wish to live them without the ham fisted interference of anyone who has such arrogance that he thinks he can know whats best for everyone.

[Eli's Client]( is in active development and looks like it will help make using Bitcoin simpler. 
[Dark Exchange]( is a very active project for a decentralized exchange. 
[Bitclip]( is a project to create dedicated Bitcoin devices, like a simple stripped down cell phone with nothing but a basic os and a WiFi chip, designed only to send, receive and hold Bitcoins. Being a dedicated device these can be very very secure. 
[Fireduck's project]( makes getting Bitcoins easier by a factor of 100 by allowing people to buy them with credit cards (Google made a special exception in their TOS to allow the selling of Bitcoins with Google checkout) 
As for Wallet storage, with the advent of better clients (eli's is far from the only one, look in the alternate clients section on the forums) with integrated encryption and maybe even automated cloud backup (encrypted of course) should do away with online wallets at least for the foreseeable future.

Or the government could design their own chips.
And any of these would bring lots of attention to Bitcoin without even restricting the supply of cards to the public like seizing the factories would. Building a factory takes months, you can not do it overnight. And by the time they managed to build the needed cards the network speed will have gone up again due to all the attention they brought to it. Remember even if the country that does this bans bitcoins mining can still be done anywhere in the world.

BitBills are not destroyed when you spend them (just like paper money is not destroyed when you spend it), the card retains its value until someone opens it up and returns the bitcoins to the network, i could spend a BitBill and then the person receiving it could go to a store and buy something with it, then the store could use it as change or use it to buy more stock.

i would say upwards of 20, to account for the cost of assembly and a facility. Of course the big issue is not cost, its supply, 6990's are the best card for mining but getting one is incredibly difficult, no matter how much money this entirety has it would have to buy up every 6990 made for months to reach this number, of course by the time months have gone by more people are mining and they need even more cards. If they cleared out every card they could, just bought all of them, then the cost would be much much larger for the same hashing power, even this would take months and it would be obvious what they where doing, attention would be brought to the matter and everyone would turn every last ounce of hashing power to solo mining just to stop them, compensating for the inevitable "bitcoin defense" rush once everyone knows the network is under attack is possible, but its very difficult to estimate exactly how much processing power can be brought to bear in desperation. Of course, this cost will probably be a few million too low by the end of the month, it just keeps going up, and buying the needed cards to preform an attack within a time span of less than a few months gets harder every day. Its not cost thats going to stop them, its supply.

1) Double spending, lets say that the bitcoin network is on block N+5 (five blocks after block N) the malicious miner goes back to block N and finds a different solution and then continues mining on what is now a fork in the block chain every other bitcoin client sees this new fork as invalid, that is until the malicious miner catches up to the main chain (51% means he can generate just a bit faster to catch up) once that happens at lets say block N+7 the network accepts the alternate chain because now its longer, the alternate chain becomes valid to be spent and the regular chain is now invalid to be spent. By manipulating this you could spend bitcoins and then have them become invalid when the main fork catches up with the malicious miner at which point the malicious miner can spend the real blocks on the chain after spending fake ones. The reason i say this cannot be profit motivated is that the amount of alternate blocks you get would be equal to the amount of blocks that they would receive during normal mining, but instead of being valid forever they would lose their value once the malicious miner lost his 51% hold.  
2)The idea here is that you would have the slave clients fake a transaction record and try and serve it as truth, if a bitcoin client has the majority of clients it was connected to disagree with it it would change its records to match. Thus allowing transfer to anyone. I am much less sure of this one than i am of number 1, this is only gleaned from some reading on how the transaction record works and i have no clue if its the correct conclusion.

And more importantly if you could do any of those things would you invest your time and effort into a tiny little project with no promise that Bitcoins would ever be worth anything at all?

No, the nerds came, and they got to work. There are countless projects in development to make Bitcoin safe and easy to use even for those not so tech savvy. The problem is these things take time. Bitcoin is not ready right now for major attention or adoption. And i am kind of relieved this happened, it gives the devs time to finish their projects and get Bitcoin ready for the mainstream users.

But almost no one could make a better one. And that is the point. Santioshi was a technical genius, and i doubt we will see a new style of coin to radically improve on his system. Combine that with Bitcoins huge dev support and a competing coin will really have some trouble taking off.

Host machines always have full access to the virtual machine. The effectiveness of such a security measure relies on any virus not knowing to look for the wallet on the virtual machine insted of the host, of course as soon as you try and make this easy for regular users it becomes the norm and viruses just find the wallet on the virtual machine. Security through obscurity is not security,  virtual machines can never be protected from the host and any protection gained is through confusion and can be very easily circumvented the moment it becomes popular enough to warrent it.

When someone sends coins to a certain address it tells all the peers that it is connected to that user such and such now owns these bitcoins, then all the peers that received your message tell all the people they are connected to and so on and so forth until the transaction spreads throughout the network every peer along the way checks the transaction for validity against the block list. The user receiving the coins is told by one of its peers that it now owns these coins and it updates its balance. Only the users directly connected to the sender can tell the senders ip and only the users directly connected to the receiver can tell the receivers ip.

Considering the size of the bitcoin network you would really need a lot of invalid transactions to put real stress on the network. 
Double spending is bad but fortunately there is a easy solution, just do not allow trading of new blocks until 1 day after their creation, at that point there will be too many blocks for an attacker to catch up and make the longer blockchain required to double spend.

First of all bitbills are not single-use they can be traded forever until someone needs the bitcoins they hold back in physical form. If you are using large denominations they could give you change in bitbills, and what they can not do for exact change can be sent to your home wallet by the cash register. As for giving cards back, i would assume that any system where bitbills worked large scale would involve a business holding enough bitbills to give you change. 
Having to have the private key stored by anyone no matter how much you may trust them is just not a good idea, have a credit card that works exactly as they do today, but instead  of paying your bill in dollars you just send your payment in Bitcoins to an address. That way there is no need to trust a centralized system with your private key and you get to pay with plastic, but you lose the anonymity advantage. I like BitBills because they keep all the advantages of Bitcoins while being physically trade able.

In a real free-market those with the most money will be the ones who have made the greatest contribution to society. Without the use of force to acquire wealth only those who proved themselves capable of producing something of value, something that benefited no only him but everyone he traded with. Those with the most power would be the ones that had proven themselves to be worthy of it. 


You act like wealth is a zero-sum game, as if the tycoons must be harmed and restrained. Andrew Carnegie, steel tycoon, made steel cheap enough for common use allowing the creation of taller buildings, faster trains, better machines. J.P Morgan, finance tycoon, made intelligent investments, gave loans those who where capable of doing a good job a chance to do it by funding companies and business ventures, even bailed out the entire united states government and economy. Bill Gates, software tycoon, made cheap practical personal computers a reality, ushering in a new era of productivity and communication. Each of these men amassed great wealth through fair trade, every one of them proved themselves worthy of their power, but even then all the money they received was nothing compared to the contributions made to humanity, the benefits that they gave to the world are incalculable. The effort saved by faster transport and stronger and cheaper buildings. The number of successful businesses made possible by Morgans loans, The number of hours saved by every human being that uses a computer to ease their work. Compared to these benefits each and every one of these tycoons got only a small portion of the wealth and prosperity created by their contributions to humanity. Each of these men existed in an unregulated market, unfettered by idiots in Washington they all managed to make incredibly massive contributions to humanity. These are the men you want to chain? This is the sort of thing you want to stop? The type of world and market you want to avoid?

From my relativly detailed  (but by no means complete) knowlage of how bitcoin works chainging the encryption algorythm for the coins would be straightfoward, set up a new version of the client to decrypt everything with the old keys,  and then reencrypt everything with the new encryption formula, backwards compatiblity would not be a problem either (for anyone but those using the dangerously outdated client) . The problem would be the adoption rate of the new client ( you would need near universal adoption before the swich to enable the new algorythm could be flipped) and of course the complexity of the new algorythm.

because its completely impractical for anyone without an ASIC supply to manage a 51% they would have to monopolize the entire Graphics card production of earth to even come close. 
Any 51% attempt would need a large supply of ASIC's to compete with the existing network, which is made up of several years supply of graphics cards and a few months worth of ASIC production at this point. 
They would either need to build their own ASIC's at which point they would need designs from the existing companies to do so in a timely manner, or somehow gain a large enough supply to perform the attack without needing to manufacture themselves.

In some ways yes, in a lot of ways no, they share the same structure to a degree and that structure is pretty well done. But that does not meant that they ended up in the same place. The Linux kernel has years of code scrutiny and code designed to run on the most attacked platforms on the internet. Apple may share the structure but they have hardly shared the focus over the past decade or so, different priorities result in different codebases with different strengths. 
Linux has long been after stability and security as its primary goals, other stuff happens downstream. 
You also have to consider that open source code going into a huge project like the Linux kernel is held to a high standard, every commit gets looked at, I would really love to see numbers some day on how that changes the attitude of the programmers making changes.

Its simply more difficult to support, lets say you want to make a virus that works on all iPhones, you only have to worry about a couple of device models all running essentially the same software. 
Then lets say you need to make somthing that works on all Android devices, you now have a dizzying array of hardware alone, from processors to wireless devices so on and so forth, on top of that you have software differences across versions of the OS, manufacturers who add their own software, and carriers who add more stuff. You also have to deal with the ROM segment of the Android population that even if you manage to get a virus on the device you then have to worry about them wiping it and installing Software even more specific and unknown. 
Of course all of these levels present the possibility for more software vulnerabilities that could be exploited, but it makes automated exploitation of known vulnerabilities a significantly more complicated setup, and then finding and writing uses for all these vulnerabilities is much more costly when instead of one discovery and implementation covering a huge number of iphone users you put the same effort into making somthing that only affects one phone, on one carrier, or even just one rom for one phone on one carrier. Same effort lower returns. 
All of this does not even cover the fact that Android runs on a Linux core, which is inherently more difficult to sneak back doors into simply by virtue of code being public and easily updated when vulnerabilities are found.  
Overall right now I would say your best bet for secure hardware/software combos is probably some of the smaller hardware projects (think Raspberry pi or Arduino) combined with a well vetted Linux distro you check against checksums after downloading.

You are aware that Litecoin's tendency to have forking issues only gets *worse* and I don't mean by a little but by a long shot as the block size increases? 
Even raising the block size from 250k to 1mb on Bitcoin where the blocks have 10 minutes to propagate increases the risk of forking or having your block dropped by the network significantly. What about 1mb blocks on Litecoin? There would be more forks than actual network.

I for one fully support black lists as a 'feature' only. 
What I mean by that is that It would be cool if in my wallet program I could go in and import a file with lists of 'tainted' addresses so that It could proceed to help me not to deal with them as well as identify funds from them. 
Essentially third parties would compile this list and the client would just have the ability to use any list compiled in this format.

I had a thought about this a long time ago. in the Whitepaper Satoshi talks about having a client that keeps nothing of the block chain other than the block headers and can use those to check historic transactions against the network [(see sections 7 and 8 in the whitepaper)](
What this means is that nodes could, at least in theory, be programmed to 'chose' which sections of the block chain they store in its entirety and abandon other sections. 
The problem with Bitcoin scaling is not that you can not make blocks large (they can be as large as you want) its that it becomes more and more impossible for regular machines to download, store, and confirm a block inside of 10 minutes. Thus pushing one of the most important parts of the network into centralization. 
But what if the default client, instead of trying to do it all, just did a bit? What I mean by that is that the client would pick a block and store/confirm everything about it past and future. Essentially it would pick a small section of the block chain to focus on, one that a machine of normal specs and download speeds can handle and trust the network for the rest, knowing that thousands of other nodes are doing the same thing such that despite the block chain being huge and transactions fast the network remains decentralized. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 01:32:04

Bitcoin can change its algorithm if the majority of the network agrees, sure it would cause a hard fork if anyone disagreed but in a situation where a quantum resistant system was feasible, and the threat imminent enough for such a system to be desirable Bitcoin itself could simply switch with very little disagreement I think. 
People seem to lose track that Bitcoin's value is not about its algorithm or its implementation, those are just facilitators for a decentralized agreed upon ledger for balances, if people are truly behind it (as will probably only be possible in situations of dire need) enough of a consensus can be had to move it to any new system without much harm at all.

Because there is no incentive to operate the network (like there is with Mining and Bitcoin) there really are only a few (if there is more than one at all) Ripple servers to use. Its not centralized by nature, but its De Facto centralized until more people start running servers.

You can set one up manually, but not by default. 
Really the biggest single thing that stops miners from keeping high fee transactions to themselves is sites like Blockchain.info, as a non mining node it is connected to a huge number of peers so it sees and propagates transactions at a ridiculous pace.

it would work in less than 3 probably. Thats the point of being so well connected.
Furthermore why would anyone work to steal a cup of coffee? 
@_date: 2013-03-24 22:25:40
I think most of you are missing the point... this is not a required thing, its just something that happens to be possible with the way Bitcoin works and anyone could make a tool to do it. 
I do not support any changes to the protocol explicitly for this, that would be terrible, but doing something similar on an individual level is very much possible if you made a client with that feature. 
If someone wants to make that its not like we can stop them.

what exactly are you referring to with the guard?

Since when you are building ASICS you are by definition designing special hardware for a task could you not design a custom memory type to optimize the processing of the function?

Hey, if someone wants to make it there is really nothing we can do to stop them. I would not end up using it myself, but hey its a free currency.

just use the official PPA, it takes like 30 seconds to setup anyways.

then wouldn't the goal be to design a processor with ridiculous amounts of L1 cache?  That still sounds doable. I mean high end server processors these days have 15mb of L3 cache.

But you could designed pared down specialty CPU's with less power consumption and much much easier parallelizability, not to mention much cheaper. 
Take 100 of these pared down cores and put them on a chip, this chip would be no faster than mining on 100 regular cpu's, but it would be much cheaper, smaller, and more power efficient, so you would just buy 100 of them for the same cost as buying 100 regular cpu based machines, wham there you have it.

May have something to do with ext4?

This assumes they can monitor all 6 hops (for a hidden service I think its double that because the who ends create a trade off point of some kind, read the documentation its interesting) which is no mean feat when they don't have equipment at every ISP on earth. 
I am not saying its impossible, but TOR still gives them a run for their money.

A double spend depends on the attacker sending the merchant a transaction while sending another transaction to the rest of the network faster (thus causing the rest of the network to reject the transaction to the merchant as it conflicts with a transaction they already have). This could be solved by merchants partnering with large nodes like BlockChain.info, sites like that are probably no more than two hops from any node on the network, if a large very well connected system like that propagated transactions from merchants right away a double spend attack would be difficult to impossible as Blockchain.info could either return that it has a double spend attack or that the transaction is so well distributed that one is now impossible in only a few seconds. hell by the time the guy picked up his stuff and walked out the door it would already be far too late to try a double spend or you would have known about already.

Plug a few of these into a Raspberry pi and you are good to go.

I think Intel may inadvertently give Bitcoin botnets a new lease on life, their next generation CPU's have dedicated SHA256 hardware, from what I understand its not even enough to really compete with a GPU much less an ASIC in hashing power, but it does compete in one category incredibly well.  
Since its dedicated hardware already on the CPU a botnet miner could mine at all times the computer was on with very very little if any slowdown or increased power draw on the host computer. It would be nearly undetectable without looking for it directly. 
This vastly increases the chances of being able to gather a very large mining botnet without being noticed and targeted by your victims.

And then Litecoin will get its own ASIC's, sure the algorithm can make it more difficult but at the end of the day I don't see how you can possibly prevent the creation of specialized hardware that will be superior to general purpose hardware without doing somthing crazy like switching how the algorithm works every 6 months to make ASIC development infeasible.

uh... yes and no. 
TOR can not guarantee anonymity on the internet when an entity can monitor both ends of the connection, for example they could see that Billy Joe running tor sent a packet that is of size A, and a TOR exit node requested a webpage of size B only a few hundred ms later. They can then see that Billy Joe got a tor packet back about the size of webpage B another few hundred ms later. Its not terribly hard to connect the dots and ultimately this flaw is unavoidable for any system trying to access the internet anonymously so long as it must do so in real time and the attacker can see the whole network. 
That is what the TOR project says they can't protect against, like I said and they know, its impossible to stop this in a real time anonymity network. 
But thats not how SilkRoad works, the problem I describe involves using TOR to access a webpage out on the greater internet, SilkRoad on the other hand is a tor hidden service, which changes things up a bit. 
Assuming the NSA could see perfectly and keep records on every inch of the internet, they could see that Billy Joe sent a TOR encrypted packet of X size, that went to some location and got a response, they would not be able to tell anything about the contents of the message other than size, and if they happen to have a single hop that they fail to catch along the way they lose track of whom Billy is talking to.
