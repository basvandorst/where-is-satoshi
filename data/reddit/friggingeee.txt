@_date: 2017-11-06 13:59:49

oh for fucks sake thank you! all this useless name calling and borderline autistic pretension of legitimacy over the respective other coin is just so incredibly annoying.  
nobody cares what it's called or if it's "true to the vision". if it works, it works, if it doesn't it will fail.
after everyone is an investment savant around here all of a sudden,  people should anyways only have burn money in the coins after which semantics don't matter. if they do, you went in over your head and are facing potentially devastating losses which is not related to the specific coin but "the market" in the first place which again you can't predict over technological or ideological claims.
stupid silly people.

1. get yourself a wallet, like electrum (see the wiki for more info on wallets)  
2. go into your exchange account and do a transfer, withdrawal or however it is called with your exchange  
3. put the address of your wallet as the destination  
4. wait patiently, it might take up to a day, depending on the Bitcoin network (the transfer speed is not in the hands of your exchange)
don't worry about the time it might take - your bitcoins will not be lost, it's just that the current block difficulty makes the next block be discovered quite slowly.
what might also help you is to understand that, yes your account with the exchange is in fact a wallet, just not one which belongs to you physically. the exchange generated it for you. a wallet always consists of a private and a public key and in the case of an exchange, it has the private key while you usually use an account to verify your claim to that key. if you have your own wallet, you possess both keys and thus no one else has access to your wallet or could withhold it from you.  
exchanges do need to operate this way though, since Bitcoin is decentralised and they are giving you bitcoins they originally had in exchange for fiat currency. (bitcoins can not be generated on the fly easily nowadays, as you might be aware. this also means that there is no one who can simply "give" you Bitcoin without either generating them for you, which is prohibitively expensive nowadays (in terms of computing power and time), or just claim that you now have some where you earlier had none, without giving their own away or the network would refute that claim on the basis that no one could verify where these new Bitcoin came from)
edit: I sure hope I got the exchange operations part right, please anyone correct me if I'm wrong
