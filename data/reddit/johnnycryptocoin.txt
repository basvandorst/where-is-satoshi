Ledger Nano and now the Ledger Nano S for me.
I love their products but as you say, there are a lot of different options for private key security.

This is what I am most interested in.
I'm assuming that bitfinex private keys and API tokens to bitgo got compromise and the requests to withdrawal the funds came through the bitfinex systems without tripping alerts.
I'd also like to know who/how it was caught.
@_date: 2016-08-23 15:20:10
Ideally exchanges will do a mix of both.
Funds held in you account are linked to a hardware wallet, funds held in your personal hotwallet for bids and asks are only transfered .
As a trader you could at least limit you risk by only exposing the funds you have bids/asks open for and keep a portion in an active trading wallet for triggered or API calls.

I also noticed he named Greg Maxwell directly...really doesn't seem to like that guy haha.

That is wonderful news and I am aware of the pools geographical location does not mean it's miners are all located there.
I'm referring more to the persception, the 2nd largest location I am aware of is Iceland for miners (which may have changed) and has been my counterpoint to the mining in china concerns I have been presented with.
Thanks for the reply.
@_date: 2016-04-10 14:31:22
the majority of that list is located in China, he is talking about it being centralized by geography.
The GFW is the biggest problem we are facing, the entire 2MB drama revolves around that issue.
We do need solutions to spread the hashing power around the world, having the bulk of it in China is a real problem.

I agree, I am completely in love with the logo.
also I found it easy to setup but it is still beta software.
This is very much a project to support.
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:44:13
hmm, I totally missed this and glad I caught it here. It was a random internet search for coinpunk.
Maybe throw the crowdfunding link up on  and in the README.md file?
I would have kicked myself if I had missed this.

Omg, it's 100% illegal to **exploit a system** for personal gain.
It's called stealing and it doesn't matter if you are grabbing a stack of bills from a faulty ATM or a stack of coins from  faulty code.
It's still stealing
@_date: 2016-06-19 22:25:54
There is nothing new about contracts.
It's.obvious no one here is a lawyer, the opinions are hilariously off base.
You see to think, as angrycybercriminal pointed out, that hacking is legal because the technology is new.

This is where is disagree with most people.
They are useful to automate back office processes that take significant human effort to complete.
They are an upgrade to existing contracts. Not some magical replacement.
@_date: 2016-06-19 02:44:48


source? sounds like you are spreading rumors, I haven't seen a single legal opinion voiced.
@_date: 2016-06-26 22:39:01
hahaha, what ever man.
keep the FUD and fear mongering up or get a citation for 'shady' projects trying to 'take over'.
@_date: 2016-06-26 11:19:39


Wow....just wow. Do you have any citations for these 'shady' projects trying to take over bitcoin blockchain?
@_date: 2016-06-19 02:47:58
No this is wrong, he used an exploit to split off way more ethereum than his DAO tokens would have let him.
If the attacker just split off his ownership this wouldn't be an issue. He used a bug to take money from other token holders and it is 100% illegal.
Otherwise, if the attacker has a legal shot they could literally choose the jurisdiction of their choice.
Obviously isn't going to happen as it is totally theft and they know it too.
@_date: 2016-06-19 10:48:05
So no source then, yup more internet warriors thinking they don't need to consult lawyers.
Have fun with that Hahahahahaha 
Get a real legal opinion, existing contract laws already cover this. Hahahahahaha

ssssshhh oh man I was just about to do this :)
I'm not certain but will foreign exchanges even accept credit cards for purchases?
wouldn't you have to ATM that money out and then exchange it for other cash?
@_date: 2015-09-25 23:08:07
payment network first, store of value second and currency is the last.
I see bitcoin as a middle ware, the bridge between physical cash and electronic cash.
I've been saying this for a while and I think we will see nation states start to upgrade their money to a cryptocurrency, bitcoin has a space in that but it will never be as a general purpose currency.
@_date: 2016-10-27 10:39:19
Not if you are trying to build a value prop off it, why do you think Ethereum is doing so well now?
@_date: 2016-10-27 17:46:40
Ok. 
Just pointing out that you are saying the same thing about other crypto that has been said about bitcoin back in 2010-2013.
There are 4-5 platforms to develop off, dash, monero, ethereum, litecoin, and bitcoin. They all bring value and one of them will solve the scaling issue.
Don't forget national currencies have already started the upgrade process, you can bet dollars to donuts that the UK, Canada, and the Swiss at least with have a crypto-dollar for.business within 2 years, for consumes within 5 years.
@_date: 2016-10-18 09:23:28
Or its providing them a marginal cost savings on internal processes.
Seems like we are missing the 'why' for this, it is confusing otherwise.
@_date: 2016-10-29 03:19:30
Couldn't find any projects or.companies that are focusing on bitcoin only eh?
Well you tried, my point still stands. Business and developer mind share has already starting to migrate away.
This has nothing to do with technology.
Austin Hill is a very smart man, he walked away for a reason.
@_date: 2016-10-27 10:37:17


then hardfork and that 'minority' (80/20 rule, fyi the minority is here). Most of us have moved on from bitcoin, still love it and it is still part of my value prop but I have given up on anything meaningful will be done.
It is now officially the MySpace of crypto, who ever gets the scaling fixed firs wins it all.
@_date: 2016-10-28 10:11:53
Where is the new development with bitcoin?
Link to some companies using it to build new services?


Facebook came later and for a number of years MySpace had way more users, so why did they lose market share?

LN use a hub and spoke topology for deployment, it's centralized around hubs.
The concept is that LN with be distributed, not specifically decentralized, around interconnect with each other as needed.
It is a badass tech and a wonderful optimization to the bitcoin ecosystem but it does add an additional layer of centralization, while distributed, is still centralized to payment processors.
It gives us Visa and Interac like payment systems that are connected to bitcoin for the settlement layer.
The critique of LN is that they won't end up distributed, but will be centralized around a few big players similar to how mining ended up.
The other than is that it is a complex solution that will take a long time to get into production and doesn't address the current capacity issue, ie side chains will be completing against visa/interac txs, not the  on chain txs. They will add more pressure to the block space.)
@_date: 2016-07-19 21:17:12
It's not a bad thing, the drama around this is mostly due to conflating capacity and optimization.
LN is a badass tech for optimization but it will, by it's very nature of competing against Visa's TPS, add more pressure on space within block.

He was hilarious and super fun.

You mean core that was Gavin Anderson and Jeff garzik? Nice attempt at rewriting history.
@_date: 2016-07-16 14:33:31
Deliver first, then the debate ends.
It's going to be an epic failure to deliver again and again.
Doesn't matter, it's going to resolve itself one way or another.
OP is almost certainly a sock puppet.
@_date: 2016-07-19 20:50:04
I'd say that is the market uncertainty between the proposed theory and what we get in production.
No plan survives contact with the enemy after all :)
@_date: 2016-07-16 21:02:23
More than you, less than some.
His comment is a lie, Gavin and Jeff both worked on the original implementation, they left because of your toxic attitude.
PS you forgot to switch sockpuppet Greg
@_date: 2016-07-20 01:17:40


nodes mean jack shit if the mining is centralized, which it already is. 
You have to build a giant strawman and the argument still falls short. We are taking about a fractional marginal cost to go from 1MB to 2MB, start doing the actual math, or read the Cornell paper on it.


what is the incentive now and how does that change because the marginal cost of running a node increases by a $1-2 a month? You are arguing against bitcoin as it is deployed right now.
@_date: 2016-07-19 21:01:05
Blocksize should be responsive to the market, that's why I support a 2MB increase now as that extra capacity will get used up within 6-9 months.
At that point though we have a number of years before we can support 4MB with a 95% node level. 
LN are great tech and I can't wait until them come online, they compete against a completely different market segment and will enhance the bridge between old world and new world fintech.
@_date: 2016-07-19 21:29:56


It's already being worked on.


please back up this assertion with some data, because there are some very clear security, economic and social incentives that *are* producing bitcoin nodes for the last 4+ years.
You've stated an ideological position, not an observation on real world data, i.e. the crypto-networks that are in production now.
@_date: 2016-07-17 09:27:51
Jesus Greg, lie some more.
You need to follow Peter's example and stay the fuck off social media.
You are a giant troll that is making things worse, not better, just because you can't admit you are ever wrong.
