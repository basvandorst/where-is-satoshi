I don’t know, I’ve been talking a lot about bitcoin at work, every day for sure. Got similar half-mocking comments during he past days. I only now figured I probably annoyed a few people and had it coming. It’ll pass :)

The research you speak of is for stocks, and for a diversified portfolio of them (s&amp;p500) I think. You can't simply assume Bitcoin to behave like that because it's a different asset class altogether. 
If you want to compare and t to anything compare it to gold. People have a broad range within which they agree on the price of gold, and it's heavily driven by their trust into other currency and the economy as a whole.
@_date: 2019-07-15 07:01:01
So would you buy now? Or is going to dip lower?

Wait you took out a loan and used it to buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-19 07:19:19


Wrong. It's a matter of adoption.  If people do not accept it as a reliable storage of value, it will not rise in value.
I'm a strong believer in crypto. But what people constantly ignore (or simply do not know) is that Bitcoin has first generation flaws that other crypto currencies have already purged. If (IF) these flaws turn out to be critical then the next generation cryptos will be adopted, not bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-19 07:13:10
The amount of analysis going into bitcoin financial decisions never ceases to amaze me.
@_date: 2019-07-19 08:42:41
I answered it in an earlier comment here, transaction capacity
@_date: 2019-07-19 07:10:47
Bitcoin has a lot of similarities to gold. It's a digital way to store value. It does not produce cash flows. Supply is limited.
If people accept it in a similar way to gold, we can (and SHOULD) expect it to behave in a similar way.

Sell it. It's not going to heal anytime soon. Sell it and get back in when it's lower.
@_date: 2019-07-19 08:00:17
The major flaw is transaction capacity. Newer currencies handle it much better. Bitcoin makes progress here, but it's a bit like pimping up a wagon when you can simply switch to a car. BUT if Bitcoin is like gold then transaction capacity might not be the worst thing. Gold is also not easily transferrable and doesn't need to be.
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:12:51
You take out a loan and use it to buy bitcoin?? I wish you the best of luck and advise against it. This is high risk, would be way too risky for me. What are you going to do if BTC goes to 3k? (Serious question, because you should have a strategy for even that case)
@_date: 2019-11-23 14:12:35
Every investment has a risk, as does every asset. Every investing strategy has a different risk profile. DCA has a lower risk profile than market timing. If you do market timing consistently (aka "buying the dip") you are almost certain to underperform against a disciplined DCA strategy.
DCA = Decreasing the swings = lowering the risk in investing in an asset
@_date: 2019-11-23 13:27:58
I wouldn't say that. Both have their own degree of risk. That is why mixing them is so dangerous. You're telling yourself you are driving a lower-risk strategy (DCA) while actually driving the risk up with market-timing.
Caveat: for bitcoin, even DCA is still quite risky.
@_date: 2019-11-18 22:48:02
I understand that principle, and objectively speaking it's true. But is there a mechanism that can relay that information to the market?
Example: [This story.]( When it breaks, I can understand it has an impact on the market price.
But what about the hundreds or thousands of cases like OP's? Is there any way that information actually enters into the price? Because if not then it does not really change the price at all.
@_date: 2019-11-23 09:09:31
Of all the strategies for bitcoin I guess DCA is the least dangerous while giving a good outlook for a return. If you do it disciplined, that is. Don't mix &amp; match, don't panic sell, don't buy like a greedy pig.
It's still too risky for me but if I ever were to re-enter bitcoin I think DCA is what I would do.
@_date: 2019-11-18 16:26:32
This guy trades.
@_date: 2019-11-24 08:25:50
True, but that is not applicable to bitcoin. 
It can make sense from an investment standpoint to hold stocks forever because they produce cash flow (in the form of dividends). Same goes for other cash-flow producing assets, like real estate. Thereby you can generate cash flow without ever selling the asset. That principle is not true for bitcoin (or gold, or silver etc.).
@_date: 2019-11-23 09:03:48
Thank you! This is exactly my thinking. I worry people use this "mining floor" argument to make themselves forget about a harsh fact, and that is that theoretically there is no minimum value of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-24 08:10:20
I am *not* wrong, and before you are throwing around terrible examples have you even tried to once look up how risk is defined in finance? And to say that DCA has nothing to do with risk is just plain ignorant. I can only recommend you to further study these concepts.
@_date: 2019-11-18 21:45:15
How do lost coins make the others worth more?
@_date: 2019-11-18 16:22:44
I was half-lucky, got out in time to get a healthy profit back in 2017. Not rubbing it in, but I'm saying in my opinion strap in tight. I am fully expecting the price to drop further over the coming months.
When the price comes down to healthy areas (my personal number is $3,000) then I'll reinvest again.
EDIT: not saying "hodl", I'm saying if it were me I would sell and wait out the coming storms.
EDIT  Downvotes? Wow typical. Does this subreddit only allow bullish comments? People, this is not a circlejerk here, people should be able to come here and discuss strategies openly. Sorry but I don't see Bitcoin moving up any time soon. Make up your own mind, be mindful of your money, good luck everyone.
@_date: 2019-11-23 13:34:44
These are not the people that move the market, in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-11-18 19:17:15
Some would call that "living in a bubble" but I get your point
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:40:10
Could even go deeper, but I agree with your other statement. Lots of small people will be flushed out before this is over
@_date: 2019-11-23 08:57:47
DCA and buying dips are mutually exclusive strategies
@_date: 2019-11-24 10:23:48
The example is terrible because it is completely fictional and leaves out an important part of the deal which is: what does the issuer and insurer get out of this? If you can show me a company that actually offers this kind of arrangement then I will show you how they profit from this. The risk for the customer will be hidden within this profit (because he will pay for *something*).
And yes it is ignorant to claim that DCA has nothing to do with risk. In many many many books, among others The Intelligent Investor, DCA is recommended as a risk-reducing strategy for passive investors. Reducing swings IS reducing risk. I don't know how this could be said any clearer. 
Your article is a pretty good overview actually and I  recommend it as introductory reading.
@_date: 2019-11-18 16:32:17
How many people actually hold bitcoin in order to spend it?
@_date: 2019-08-15 06:51:14
Less than wearing jewellery, expensive suits, bags, makeup, perfume, shoes or sunglasses. Do I need to I remove all those too?
@_date: 2019-08-16 08:41:19
That's why they're called status symbols and why people buy them. Same goes for a bitcoin tattoo and other bitcoin shwag. Nobody need assume that you are bunkering a lot just because you have a tattoo of it on your arm.
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:54:08
But then I would just buy it at fair price and hope for it to be overvalued again? 
@_date: 2019-12-17 08:04:22
Is anybody really saying "It's too expensive"?? According to the people replying here many people are actually saying "it's too late", meaning they believe that there is no more growth to be expected. These people will not join the community anytime soon.
@_date: 2019-12-17 10:59:30
Haha I'm really hoping now stracciatella fractions become a thing :D
You make a good point with lightning network development, that was one good push for adoption (wish I could find a place where I can see measurements for it - do you know any, by any chance?). As for the German banks I think this remains to be seen. My understanding is they won't yet get so actively involved in the trading but allow investors to store their currencies.
@_date: 2019-12-17 07:36:21
I don't think marketing alone is the answer. If there is a killer use case for cryptocurrency the marketing will take care of itself.
I'd be interested in growth in spending bitcoin, though. Any idea where to find those numbers?
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:18:42
Sorry if my question sounds ignorant but If it’s “correcting” does that not mean it returns closer to it’s true value? Because that would mean I should not buy yet
@_date: 2019-12-17 11:01:13
I don't quite understand that question. Do you mean what is the point of metrics in general?
@_date: 2019-12-17 08:00:52
"It's too late" means they don't believe in further price increases. Better ask some more people
@_date: 2019-12-11 21:55:41
You've just given me a reason to buy bitcoin again: get services from bitcoin believers at an *unbelievable* bargain.
In all honesty, why in the name of all that is good would you take on all this future risk if you don't have to? Even if you're very certain (say, 100%) that bitcoin is going to rise in price 14x in the forseeable future: it's still an uncertainty. It's like me saying to you: "You know what? Instead of paying you €35 for this lesson I'll give you this scratch card that cost me €1. But it's got a main prize of €100,000 so if you win that that would be an amazing hourly price, right? Here you go!"
@_date: 2019-12-20 16:28:17
How do you measure adoption? I find active addresses is good, but not the best measure
@_date: 2019-12-17 13:33:16
I get your point. Seems like this discussion is not the right one for you. This discussion is for people who think about Bitcoin as a way to increase their money, and the numbers they should track to get build their hypothesis about future price increases. 
But I do see an important potential connector and that is scalability. As you point out, this is a critical issue with Bitcoin at the moment. What I'd be interested in is this: would higher scalability lead to a higher bitcoin price? And if so, how strong is this effect?
@_date: 2019-12-17 09:48:06
It is the approach that reduces risk the most, I would say. But only if practiced with discipline. My concern is that many people buy more when it's down, then don't buy when they think it's hitting the ceiling, then buy again when they think it hit the floor. That is not DCA.
@_date: 2019-12-17 08:07:04
About 50% of them ;)
@_date: 2019-12-12 21:37:48
You do, you just call it differently. But don't gamble with your time. Your time is surely valuable I don't doubt, so in my opinion you should put a fair price tag on it. And if BTC then does appreciate in value, you'll have even more ;)
@_date: 2019-12-09 21:38:11
I would totally buy those lessons. Could I give you the money in € and you could then purchase the equivalent of 0.0004BTCs with it?

Lol. I can see the headlines now. "BTC still in better shape than Titanic!" 
That'll get 'em to buy :D :D :D
BTC is a shit show for now. I exited about 10m ago and haven't regretted it. I expect it to go far lower before it will do any sort of turn-around.
@_date: 2018-11-30 18:36:48
Traditional investment is great to have. No high rewards, but a safer haven. Cryptocurrency is definitely ahead of its time. BTC is the strongest horse in the race I suppose. But there's others, and the strongest horse does not always win.
By the way, do you know a good resource to read about cryptocurrency in general? I sometimes feel like this sub is too much of a thought bubble and would love to read up more on cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:29:33
Let's talk about this! Some key points from the article:
* The use of bitcoin for commercial payments has dropped dramatically this year, even as the original digital coin starts to fulfill one of the basic features of any payment currency: stability.
* “There would have to be a stability requirement if it is to become another form of money,” said Joni Teves, a strategist at UBS in London.
* Bitcoin still endures torrid swings in price, as this week’s 30 percent plunge shows. For a spell last month, though, the cryptocurrency was more stable than U.S. stocks.
* “Bitcoin payments processing is seeing a slow but consistent decline,” said Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at research firm Autonomous Next, of the data on Coinpayments.
* While coordinated regulation remains far off, some developments designed to address the so-called “scalability” problem — how many transactions per second the bitcoin network can handle — are underway.
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:07:06
Sorry but this sounds highly risky to me! I don't know how much you have lost or still have, but with a thing like bitcoin (I'm avoiding the word "investment" here) I would not wager my entire funds on it. Definitely buy some on the hopes that it goes up and you strike gold. But don't overextend yourself - imagine a world where 1 BTC = $0.01. What then?
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:41:08
Why would it? No one currently believes that bitcoin is useful. Transactions are growing really slowly. If there's any value to bitcoin it's transactions and it's well below last year's highs.
@_date: 2018-11-27 10:29:27
Any in particular? Are you basically speculating on altcoins being heavily correlated with bitcoin performance? Or do you rather think btc is going down and some altcoin will take over?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:49:45
I feel for you. You’re definitely NOT a loser just because you didn’t understand what you were getting into (nobody does). There’s lucky people, and there’s unlucky people. Use the newfound peace of mind as your biggest learning: if you’re that worried to lose an amount, maybe you weren’t supposed to invest it in the first place.
Not trying to be an asshole, I have made plenty mistakes myself. Mistakes from which you learn can turn out to be the best money you ever spent :)
@_date: 2018-11-27 12:21:36
Holy shit is that a chart?? Take my money right now!
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:59:27
OK well BTC is well below 9K now, go ahead and buy more, I'm not saying it won't work, but it is quite risky. Because even if you're eventually right, until that point you won't have any additional cash flows being generated by all that tied up capital. Mighty risky unless you can afford to "hodl".
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:09:31
DCA with non cash flow generating assets is near suicide. Be careful and stay cool, and I hope you don’t need the money!
@_date: 2019-09-26 19:44:34
What I said does not conflict with my "memory" of the recession. I merely encourage everyone to think for themselves. I didn't get burned (much) because I wasn't exposed as many others were. The small investors who are just happy to finally be part of wealth creation - they're the ones getting in last and losing everything while the big guys cash out. And I'm not even saying that cynically. This is the reality.
@_date: 2019-09-26 12:24:35
Do you want people to "see this", or so you want them to stop warning you of the serious risk of investing in something you don't understand and can't control?
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:42:27
A company has revenues, debt, cash flows. Granted, its value can't be determined exactly by any individual. But it can be determined far more accurately than a cryptocurrency exchange rate
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:01:27
I personally know many people who make money in all kinds of different markets. Equities, currencies, commodities, gold you name it. I make a healthy amount with stocks, check my comments history. You CAN shift the odd in your favour if you can understand the asset you're trading or investing in. 
My point is cryptos are not possible to be understood yet. People point on a curve on a chart and say "That's why I will invest in bitcoin right now." Sometimes they are right, sometimes they are wrong, but they never knowingly had the odds in their favour, they simply got lucky. Just look at the most recent dip. Some player unloaded their position and all hell broke loose. You can't plan for that. 
And where I'm shaking my head is when people then run around shouting "HODL! All those who sell are suckers!". Are you kidding? Selling in the face of unknown risks is a smart thing! And by discouraging that they are just creating more of the herd - which is of course what they want to do. Because nobody wants to be the last out the door...
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:11:59
I'm very pro crypto. I'm against group think and the repetitive cheerleading. It is a good thing to be careful about investment and I often have the feeling that some people on here are made to believe that bitcoin will be worth millions in the future. This is possible, but not very likely.
@_date: 2019-05-18 20:15:23
Wait how much have you made with bitcoin? If you can afford it then why not move to a proper area if your area is so dangerous?
@_date: 2019-05-18 20:42:04
Ok just be safe and don't share so much personal information on here, you never know...
@_date: 2018-12-02 22:13:29
Will you consider buying stuff with your btc?
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:53:15


This is very interesting, I've never heard that actually. Why is that?
@_date: 2018-12-01 11:13:43
I suppose the odds for BTC are higher. :) But it's not really about the odds. 
The average lottery pays out 50% of ticket sales. So you will most likely end up with less money, but there is a slim chance you strike gold. That is very similar to holding a cryptocurrency. Because at this point, it is very difficult to say where any of this leads.
@_date: 2018-12-05 09:36:30
The most dangerous thing is a bored investor. Your assets are not supposed to entertain you, they're supposed to earn money for you. If you don't believe that they can do that any more, sell them and buy some that you believe can do it. And occupy your thoughts with something else, in the end it's just money :) (or in BTC's case, even that is not clear yet).
@_date: 2018-12-05 13:03:44
So far, whenever people bought bitcoin, prices increased drastically.
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:21:10

When things are going great nobody seems to be able to imagine them being any other way.
When things are shit it is exactly the same.

"I'm not going to spend anything that I believe to go up in value."
Not a BTC holder myself at the moment, but isn't that pretty much the conundrum of the community at the moment? Everybody hodl, don't sell but also don't spend because the next rally is just a week away?
@_date: 2018-12-02 22:06:13
So your losses of $6,000 per coin are only on paper! Yayyy
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:17:38
Different reasons.
In essence, they misreported numbers and the markets were too disinterested to look more closely. So they were getting away with it for quite some time. All the while the stock price kept rising. But at some point, someone poked a hole in the balloon and it all came crashing down like a house of cards.
Actually, maybe the reasons are not that different after all.
@_date: 2018-12-02 22:08:53
That is a sound way of thinking about it! It could honestly go either way as far as I am concerned. But if I ever jump back in, I want to do it with an amount that I could lose.
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:34:54
You are right, in terms of transparency they are not easily comparable. What they have in common is that both are (were) prone to overenthusiasm. And people did not look closely at fundamentals. In Enron's case, some people (investors, journalists) raised concerns over their cash flows. But nobody wanted to listen. And that resulted in inflated prices. 
I am willing to bet that that was the same for most of those who got into bitcoin around July last year and later. No interest in fundamentals
