better buy a tesla bro! 
@_date: 2019-02-25 13:06:24
Better safe than sorry guys, get your money off exchanges
@_date: 2019-02-20 12:19:58
yeah, there are people that know how to trade, but for the rest of us just knowing the fundamentals(and understanding them) + buying whenever you can is the best strategy lol I stopped watching the price months ago
@_date: 2019-06-02 18:24:56
For example i made connections from localbitcoins with sellers. So next time i want to buy from them we just meet and exchange. cause i already trust them
@_date: 2018-11-28 12:02:53
I am using localbitcoins. its peer to peer network
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:30:35
I am excited as well!!! Its like christmas came early. The technology is there, nothing has changed except bitcoin is getting better and better everyday, especially with the Lightning network. I do plan of setting up a network node in order to support the infrastructure! Keep accumulating boys
@_date: 2018-11-07 12:31:09
f\*ck KYC bullshit bro! BISQ all the way
@_date: 2018-11-24 13:05:40
You are the real MVP bro, I will try to setup a node following your guide and if i have free time can help you with the web interface. It will be a pleasure for me to give back to the community
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:12:58
It means that you schedule meetings with people at coffee shops or malls you give them the money and they give you crypto. There is escrow as well so they cannot cheat
@_date: 2018-11-06 12:52:31
This is what bitcoin is - permissionless censorship-resistant currency. Congrats to BISQ team!
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:32:19
Are you buying regularly like every week or? What do you use? I plan to use localbitcoins for this purpose in order to buy small chunks like 500$/week
@_date: 2018-11-27 22:46:32
Checkout localbitcoins. Its peer to peer network, best case is when you buy in cash, you meet in some restaurant or coffee shop and transfer the make the deal
@_date: 2018-11-12 16:14:15
I don’t want to evaluate it lol
@_date: 2018-11-08 15:16:30
And then forgetting the exact words lol
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:35:41
Maybe open account at some exchange that has usd/btc pair?
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:26:58
The internet needs to collapse in order bitcoin to die IMO
@_date: 2018-11-11 15:17:44
There are debit cards where you fill them with btc  and can spend with just a swipe. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:18:48
Like Andreas is saying .. cryptos can coexist together, but yeah i think btc will have the dominance for the upcoming year, why not decades even
@_date: 2018-11-07 12:30:07
I am the same page about java like you. People have different taste and mine is not java definitely lol :D 
@_date: 2018-11-27 22:24:04
I don’t understand why people panic so much. They either don’t understand the technology or just spread FUD in order to accumulate more or maybe just trading
@_date: 2018-11-27 08:46:24
Hey this is the most simplistic and comprehensive comparison between the internet and bitcoin! Keep making videos bro!
I am thinking of setting up a node to help the network. I thought after certain deal or purchase is finished we should close the channel but now i realize maybe only the buyer and seller open and sell channels often.  In your example with Alice why she is having open channel with the coffee shop isn’t she supposed to close it once the purchase is done?
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:31:54
I am using localbitcoins. Its a peer to peer sell. You meet at coffe shops and so on.
@_date: 2018-11-07 20:45:10
Whats your favorite language?
@_date: 2018-11-13 10:43:08
How much was the actual transaction cost 
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:01:37
@_date: 2018-11-23 08:05:15
How you are doing that? Via an exchange?
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:20:43
who pays taxes?
@_date: 2018-11-27 22:25:28
I hope you are right
@_date: 2019-01-01 20:51:17
Okey, i will give it a try next time! Thanks!
@_date: 2018-11-23 08:13:46
Check localbitcoins website
@_date: 2019-01-01 11:40:01
i wonder if this bitwage thing is working at all .. saw a lot of negative feedback in the internet
@_date: 2018-11-23 11:09:01
I will research the wirex thing as well, but I wonder if OTC like localbitcoin would work too for small amounts
@_date: 2017-09-22 21:24:41
i would suggest trezor. And be careful not to lose your passphrase! You can dig it up in your backyard
@_date: 2019-05-24 07:34:32
Are they accepting bitconnect?
@_date: 2019-05-22 15:51:24
I think its already stolen or lost. Fellow bulgarian here
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:24:12
I understand how you feel. A friend told me a stock market is volatile cause a stock went down 5% in a month and i was like laughing lol
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:27:08
Rule  of bitcoin. Leave your money on the exchange. There is no point of buying hardware wallet. They are expensive /s
@_date: 2018-12-02 14:01:21
F these guys from g20
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:31:23
Whats the best way to do it? I think the first step is not to get verifired anywhere so they cannot link your address to the identity
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:49:47
Did you setup one?
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:32:48
Lets pray to see 2k usd!
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:53:51
Yeah
