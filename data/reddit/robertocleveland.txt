California prohibits alternative "money", but the IRS has already declared that bitcoin is taxed as "property" not as "currency". So I take that to mean the IRS does not consider it money either.
(Actually I'm surprised California doesn't have an existing law against owning property without the state's permission....)

The organizers picked Dominica due to the fact citizenship can be purchased for $100,00....around 2,000 people have done this (I'll let you guess why) and are no doubt a prime demographic who want a means to transfer wealth outside of the banking system.

The Argentine people already store their some of their wealth in US Dollars, it would be more convenient to just store in Bitcoin instead.

Nothing wrong with selling BTC at this price point...I sold BTC recently as a strategic loss to offset 2014 capital gains in stock investments, with the intention of repurchasing BTC back after a 30-Day wait to clear US wash-sale rules.

A use scenario would be a one-time-issued key for a specific person and specific event, where a traditional interface to accept bitcoin payments directly is not cost practical.
Possible example: an urban car tire lock attached by a police officer for a parking infraction. The "unlock address" would be printed on the parking ticket, and if the user sends .5 bitcoin to that address then the tire lock, with only enough technology required to scan a single bitcoin address periodically, would unlock.
Something along those lines...

The most recent filing still does not list the fund's expense ratio, so it isn't the final one.
