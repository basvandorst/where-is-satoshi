Are you trying to understand crypto currency through what you belive is general stock knowledge? 
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:40:26
So you want to give them a paper wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:38:26
No one can know that. There is no likelihood of it happening. It is a possibility that no one can speculate on in the same way that it could possibly hit $2 and no one can speculate on. 
Do your research and make your own estimates

Wallets as in just creating them or wallets as in creating a wallet and putting the private key onto a usb or ledger?

I will look into that, but I am not totally sure. There is a Bitcoin ATM at a store not too far from me, but I'm not sure that it supports cash to Bitcoin. I'll have to check though
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:23:38
I would like to know as well

Not whatsoever. If you are interested in Bitcoin, you should read the whitepages to get learned.

I have done this and have been holding since $750. I'm just looking for more ways to earn in my pass time, mainly looking to work.
I am currently a full time student without a job, so just putting money into Bitcoin isn't what I'm looking for. Thanks though :)

Please just stop. Your motives are so transparent.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:25:48
This one is kinda just sad. Find attention somewhere else
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:23:18
How how

Do you mind me asking how you bought the bitcoin? I own 61mBTC but have obtained them by selling things to be paid in bitcoin.
I would like to make a heavier investment in bitcoin but have no clue what the best way is to convert my money instantly.

Will it be updating on the websites like Newegg?
@_date: 2017-06-21 03:14:18
Would I do that by re-downloading and just selecting the "find seed" instead of create new one when doing the setup wizard?

It asks to save a file called "default_wallet" which I saved onto the hard drive I wish to store the wallet on. Are there other files to accompany the electrum wallet that may be saved elsewhere? If so, will this effect my electrum wallet, or are the important folders on the correct drive?
@_date: 2017-06-25 23:34:55
That's what I needed to hear. All the other comments were sarcastic, off topic or not helpful. Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:06:50
So you would suggest that we get our coins onto a hard drive? I have never done this. I would assume that there are fees when the coins come from a wallet like Blockchain. Is this correct?
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:20:02
It's my understanding that most of us are in it for the long run. Many people see bitcoin becoming an official currency, and if that were to happen, we would probably see numbers higher than $5000. 
That being said, if the bitcoin prices were to jump up for an unstable reason we may see people selling off their bitcoin and hoping for the currency to crash so they can re-buy. 
I am by no means an expert, so listen to other opinions as well. I'm just trying to learn all I can. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:53:56
Yup, I agree. It's time for everyone to pack up their things and forget about bitcoin. Since this new discovery has left bitcoin worthless, I will buy your Bitcoins for a whole $5 out of the kindness of my heart.

Where are these news papers? I need to save and frame one. 
At $750 I suggested my friends and family invest before the halving. Framing this will be my everlasting "in your face"
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:53:53
I'm not sure what you mean by this. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 04:01:42
Ok, I'll give that a try. Thank you
