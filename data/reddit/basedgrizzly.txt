Super worried about it at this point.

Yeah that’s how I feel. I said in 24 hours I will be reporting if I don’t have my money. If they don’t reply then I figure they are a scammer. If they do, I might give the benefit of the doubt.

Yeah I did big time. Never again. But yeah I get the same kinda vibes from this guy. Unless I don’t hear from him again. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 03:50:50
Damn man. That is a possibility too.

What drevoh did was first ask me to split my payment into two separate transactions. The deal was that I would release the first half of my Bitcoins to him after he showed me proof that he was going to wire transfer the full amount of the $6,300 to my bank account. I would then pay him the second half of the money after I had received the payment. I agreed, even though it seemed like a somewhat sketchy deal, because this guy had a 100 percent feedback rating, I trusted him somewhat. This was 8 or 9 days ago, and he had said that the transfer would take 2 days maximum. After it did not send for 4-5 days, he attributed it to Easter weekend. 
On Wednesday April 4th, he had basically told me that I should have received an email from my bank (which I now believe to be fake), I did not see the email originally, but he told me to check my spam, and I saw it in there. He asked me at this point to release the other half of the Bitcoin so he could get confirmation from his bank to send the money over. The email stated that I would receive the payment 1 hour after confirmation from the sender's bank. It has now been 3 days and I am fed up with this. This user now has all of my bitcoin, and continues to contact me making excuses. He told me today that he would deposit money directly to my bank account if I didn't receive my money by 4pm, and yet he never did that. I haven't heard anything from him since then, even though I warned him that I will now have to report him as fraudulent.

Forsure man. I just took the L, learned a lesson and am moving on. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:38:56
I have a record. The weird thing is that in the conversations I’ve had, this guy seems decent. Also I don’t think his feedback would be so high if he were a known scammer. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:44:10
Hmm I guess that is a possibility. I guess all I can do is wait and see if he gets back to me. I sent a message threatening to report him within 24 hours if I don’t have my money.

If you read my post you would see that I already have taken responsibility for what may happen here. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 04:21:11
Or... just use coinbase instead of a sketchy website filled with potential scammers.
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:40:07
Yeah... I’m starting to feel the same way. Fuck. Is it possible to be a scammer with a 100 percent positive feedback review with 100’s of transactions?
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:42:35
Fair enough
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:42:43
Yeah.. I’m a fuckin idiot for that. I will see though. He might be legit, he has over 100 sales, and has a 100 percent feedback score. I did send him a message  threatening him if I did not receive my money within 24 hours. I will see what he says to that. If he doesn’t reply back than I know he’s a scammer. If he does reply apologizing than I will give him the benefit of the doubt once again. This whole process has been fucking ridiculous though.
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:15:49
And yeah yeah I know, I'm an idiot. I've heard it before and I already know. I shouldn't have released the bitcoins. Doesn't change the fact that this guy operates in a shady manner and he took advantage of my stupidity.
@_date: 2018-04-06 04:01:56
That’s good advice. This is my 2nd time using this website so this might just be a very expensive lesson. Do you think there is still a chance that this guy is legit?
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:54:55
I'm telling you to not go to the guy because he is shady. That's all. If you want the details, I can provide them.
