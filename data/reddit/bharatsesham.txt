Let us assume the price has gone up to 15k which might be actual value. But at that point how many people are going to use it to buy things in a store. That is the real use of blockchain right, use it for daily transaction without any regulations. Moreover if the demand of bitcoin increases, the cost of validating a transaction also increases.

I have been rethinking this.

All we can do is wait and see my friend.

Yes, but any blockchain can simply do the trick and give you financial freedom. But in bitcoin, the value is only increasing because of speculators betting on it. It is artificial value creation to some extent, I guess.

Yes, I hope blockchain becomes a part of daily life. It will expand its roots into more than financial sector. And it is not long before we can see a society functioning full on blockchain.

Yes it is everyone that have a part of bitcoin that will decide the value. But never to forget some have higher impact and some have lower impact, but still the problem will come only when the organization with higher impact try to cash out their profits.

Normal people with average salary won't be interested in buying bitcoin as the cost is high and the price is varying a lot, so people doesn't want to take the risk. Most of them as far as I know bought bitcoin just to get profits out of it or just to keep it speculating that the prices might go up. The only time where bitcoin can be useful is when all the big whales drop out, the price of bitcoin is stable a decision people use it for day to day transactions. Just be honest how many people are actually using bitcoin to buy regular commodities like bread and cook from a store.? Until then it is just one more financial asset on which people and companies will bet on.

No worries, I got 23 times on what I bought it for. Happy with it.

Can you please tell me what is the miners charge as transaction fees to transfer 1 BTC now and back in 2015.?

Can someone tell me how new bitcoins are added to the system?
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:27:57
Will definitely try to get back.

This is true. Blockchain is a far more of a revolution than AI.

I am totally a supporter of the block chain technology, currently I have ripple. But the one day VAR for Bitcoin is 45%, which is pretty high for any financial asset.

Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:56:37
I hope everything you mentioned would happen as quickly as possible. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:33:40
I am not here for a fight. Just wanted to have a better understanding on why people are giving more importance to bitcoinsusd compared to other crypto currency. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:47:21

Unfortunately I sold everything (.9BTC) when the price was around 2k.
