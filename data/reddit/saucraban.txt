SIMULATED that's the meaning, seems you finaly UNDERSTOOD!!
@_date: 2014-04-16 04:46:42
Being FinCEN doesn't make them less ignorant.
The definition of "Virtual" implies to be opposite to real. 
Just because they are stored in computers that does not mean it is a fake money. 
For example: - Do we used the therm "Virtual Photography" When cameras no longer needed film rolls to work? No. We called them Digital Cameras, and digital pictures.
- Do we say "Virtual Music" when we changed Vinyls and CD's for MP3? No, we say we download digital media music files.
-Also with e-books, they are not virtual books, they are digital copies.
So, what is the reason to call bitcoin virtual instead of digital?

When you say virtual currencies, everybody understand non real currencies, and this is the fact is not true.
About dicctionaries, I checked the definition in my native languange and differs from your source. I aslo checked english wiki

No, as said before, virtual means that is not a real thing, you use virtual when you represent something. And bitcoin represent itself.
For example, virtual money is the Dollars in The Sims, if now Sims let you play with virtualy with bitcoins instead, that would be virtual bitcoins, because they not belong to the blockchain, they simulate being bitcoin money. That is the meaning of virtual.

No, it says " being on or simulated on a computer or computer network".
Bitcoin is pure math, an algorithm, bitcoin doesn't not represent a Dollar but ocurring in internet. Bitcoins are themselves, not a simulation of other thing.

Exactly this. I hate reading about Virtual Money, cause Virtual its the opposite of Real, that may lead to non real money, and is not true. It's Real Money but Digital. You can print a paper wallet and have it your hands also, you can give you paper wallet and you will give the money the same way you give a bill.
It's so simple but at same time so complicated for narrow minds. But yea, my parents also hated smartphones when they appeared, and now they can't live without Candy Crush.

Saying everything related to internet is virtual is pretty non accurate, as I said you before, do you use virtual for you dowloadable music? do you use virtual for you pdf books? No, you use digital.
The word virtual exist before from internet, and ethimologicaly comes from the latin word "Virtus" and has to due with the will of doing a job that doesn't really do. For example and hologram is a virtual object, because it is a projection of a tridemimensional fotogram of a real object. In geometric optics, some images are produced by projections of mirrors, they are virtual images, when we are in front of a mirror the image we see of as is a virtual image.
