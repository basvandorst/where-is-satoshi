LOL I just looked over your account and most your comments get down voted, and it seems like "snowflake" may be the only "insult" you know. Educate yourself and people may like you more.

Your user name is right, you are grump and probably plumpy,
go eat some more pizza so you can feel better again.
@_date: 2019-11-30 19:36:57
Can’t relate
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:35:25
yeah I think im going to buy next time it goes down a fair bit. then ill sell back at like 9-10k maybe more, but Ill still hold some for the long run in another wallet and add to it monthly
@_date: 2019-11-27 20:31:17
why so little? even if it skyrockets youll have like $10 if that
@_date: 2019-11-09 00:21:19
It just looks odd, the B is so big and the kiosk only take up part. I just doe not seem very well thought out. looks big and bulky when the machine it self is skinny. 
maybe if the screen and stuff was implanted into the B it would look cooler.
@_date: 2019-11-09 07:44:48
well yes that is obvious. But it could have been done a buch of other ways. Probably cheaper to make too.
@_date: 2019-11-27 21:17:57
The fee for selling will eat all your “profit”. I even think $100 is a little amount to invest. Unless you are doing $100 weekly/ monthly with a total of like $1000 invested being the goal. Not just a one time $100

Bitcoin buns

If you think it’s a contact, mistake them
@_date: 2019-11-08 00:23:05
I think if this was real you would not make a post asking if you should take the $55,000. you would have told no one and turned that to fiat
@_date: 2019-11-08 17:55:55
nice but that is ugly af. at least make it look sleek or better than that.

Yeah if you are trying to mine bitcoin with a PC in 2019 you are like 4 years behind on bitcoin information.
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:39:28
Because that’s what it’s at right now. It was at like 3-4K for months and no one asked why
@_date: 2019-08-11 22:35:44
Anything. I got to like goodwill and garage sales. Find stuff worth money that is being sold for very cheap. Most recently I found a set of mighty beans I bought for $15 and it sold for $300 on eBay. It takes a lot of sourcing before you make 3-4K a month but it can happen.

But can it create me a bitcoin in 3 weeks
@_date: 2019-08-10 21:16:59
Oh look a post I saw last week
@_date: 2019-08-10 13:54:14
I can tell OP doesn’t know much about bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-11 22:03:23
Get a good paying job? Get a side hustle?
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:41:41
Yeah since it went from 4K to 10-13k a ton of new people joined. I expected that to make it raise more then it did. I feel like we will be in this 10-13k limbo for a while. But you never know tomorrow it could shoot to 15k you never know.
@_date: 2019-08-11 09:13:26
Oh look this repost for the 100th time
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:25:59
Well I hope you are planning to hold for a few years if so you will be greatly rewarded.
@_date: 2019-08-07 10:53:55
Who said they would spend all the money. Only a dumb person would.
@_date: 2019-08-11 23:10:41
Come to America. Every other place in the world is shit for making money. In America you can make $500 off of junk you find in a dumpster
@_date: 2019-08-11 09:40:41
That’s like banning as because it’s one letter away from ass. Man what type of world do we live in.
@_date: 2019-10-09 10:18:40
It’s not illegal to sell on a platform. Just like a pawn shop won’t get charged with a stolen item they just get it taken away. Can it be taken away? Well I don’t have that answer.
@_date: 2019-08-07 19:07:44
Still illegal to scam a scammer
@_date: 2019-08-13 01:49:15
Yeah it can be from the exchange you take it out from. If they are KYC
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:01:40
You bought a bitcoin? Or you bought bitcoin in general. The first sentence would mean you spend like 11k on your first every bitcoin purchase
@_date: 2019-10-30 09:43:41
It’s pretty good, not going to lie.

Crack = drug
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:48:34
No one knows. If they did I’m sure they could predict the coin and be a billionaire by now
@_date: 2019-08-13 01:55:27
No an exchange it’s a place like coinbase.
@_date: 2019-08-11 19:21:56
Why buy bitcoin to buy stuff with if you have no idea how to? Usually a normal person researches that before buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:42:03

Nah, when you buy that avocado dip appetizer you are paying for the dip and the chips are free.
@_date: 2019-10-18 07:31:52
Maybe if you mine for like 50 years
@_date: 2019-10-31 23:51:51
@_date: 2019-08-11 22:10:47
Anything you can do on the side? Maybe reselling  or something like that? I resell and make about 3-4K a month
@_date: 2019-12-31 04:31:30
They are the ones laundering their dirty cash. they know better then us that it can be laundered lol

He wants the internet points

I bought an apple watch last year and yeah I never use the thing. The first month I was like oh cool I can track my sleep and stuff. now I dont even look at the tracking apps. I just use it to make quick reminders and set timers/alarms hands free. I use it more as an actual watch then I use it for all the features.

Lol I bet it’s that tamper monkey script that’s going around that steals your coins when you send to any address. No one finds/buys something like this and then tells the world about it. Even a websites like HF, nulled, MPGH no one just gives it away for free.
