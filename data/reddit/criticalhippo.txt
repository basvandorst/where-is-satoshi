what dip
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:41:06
forgive my sarcasm. My point is the price is as wobbly as ever.

Thanks for sharing. He is very articulate. So, the utility of a given money affects the price against others?
I have so much to learn

Can someone explain this to me? I️ thought bitcoin was supposed to be the same price regardless of borders...
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:02:57
That makes sense. Thanks for your explanation

I think I took for granted how easy is was, from my perspective, to have internet and acquire Bitcoin. Also, the money came from an infrastructure established in fiat currency.

True, but the memes only reinforce the idea that we're only here to get rich off of speculation, not to support the technological revolution. It makes bitcoiners look bad.

life is like a Bitcoin
it goes up, it goes down
it almost never goes just right.

I sent a low fee transaction today! 1.01 sat/byte and it was confirmed in just 12 minutes. Not bad for a $0.04USD fee
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:38:25
Shit, is that a thing? Thanks for the paranoia
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:52:37
Thanks for clearing that up. I will now be returning to my regularly scheduled paranoia

You tryina tell me aliens made bitcoin? A.I.?
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:41:59
I bought some. HODLMAO

My wild forecast: we will hit 4k way earlier than expected, only to pop down again to about 2.5
It could happen within a month for all I know.
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:48:47
ok but it would be 10x cooler if you said AI created bitcoin
