Okay, I've used Airbitz for almost two years now and I have never seen an ad of any kind. Screenshot or it didn't happen.

I like both and have used both a lot but have been using Airbitz exclusively for the past 6 months or so. I like the versatility and the accounting features. The auto account backups with off-chain meta data that's completely private. The set and forget 2FA is dope too, especially when you have an account shared on two devices. I don't have to worry about a paper backup if I remember my username + password and have the recovery questions setup. I wish Airbitz had a feature like Locks and I wish the Buy/Sell service inside Airbitz was available in my state. I wish mycelium had the easy and familiar on boarding process like Airbitz. It's impossible to get noobs to handle the 12 or 24 words process, but getting people started on Airbitz takes like 1min after download and the new version has a referral link that pays you when people you refer buy gift cards with Fold inside of Airbitz. I love that. I wish both wallets would figure out how to put working coinjoin in their apps or a savings account like feature. Did I mention I like the accounting features in Airbitz? I just can't stop using Airbitz.

Airbitz. Hands down.

This thing looks sick. Everyone's making a new coin or some new coinified thing or some scammy Nation idea or other tripe. This is a simple idea for an app that could be actually f**king USEFUL. The fact that these guys actually care about robust privacy is worth like 100,000XP in my book. If they truly have a zero-knowledge set up this could be one of the most important Bitcoin applications to come out in 2014.

So, is SpiderOak truly ZK - in your opinion - then? 
@_date: 2014-12-05 16:47:47
This is how I understand it. Would be great if more service providers used this design. Hopefully this Tapeke project can help encourage other founders and startups to go this route.

it's not hard to find people who "knew" and communicated with satoshi in this community. I wouldn't doubt they've had some interesting conversations.
@_date: 2014-08-06 00:50:56
Nothing surprising or new here. Cool story, tho.
@_date: 2014-08-06 01:04:32
And, "upmost urgency" too? I have never, ever heard anyone use the preposition "upmost" in place of the word "utmost" when describing the highest degree possible or greatest extent or intensity of the noun, "urgency." 
Someone with his level of education and as voluminously well read as one must be to hold such degrees and positions would never make such an error or typo. In terms of OP's authenticity, this use "upmost" is a text-generation homophonic brain turd, and a huge red flag for me. That, along with the all-too-specific description of OP's origin. 
If OP had ANY fear of retribution from his naughty bitcoin report, LET ALONE fear of retribution for posting the above (!!!), OP's post would have been much, much less specific on those background details, which are - in truth - wholly unnecessary for a pseudo-anon story except that it serves as an attempt to lend (highly risky) credibility to a random reddit post. Stinks like a fake to me. Good try, though. 
EDIT: If not fake, I do wish you will take more sincerely careful precautions in all your subsequent actions, OP. It would not be hard to narrow down who you are to a small handful of possibilities, if the info you've given above is true. I wish you luck and safety, and I hope you get your story vetted, verified, and published as quickly as you possibly can.

I think the reason OP is here is to distract from the FAR more important [post]( on this sub... 
Nice little troll move.

Yeah, all of this^

Damn man. Shoulda used Airbitz.
@_date: 2016-06-17 19:16:37
I've used it for years. It keeps getting better. Simple setup. Auto backup. Fully private. Accounting features are killer, unlike any other app. It's one of the safest if not the safest and most secure/private bitcoin apps. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 18:46:43
Love it! This is the best all-around mobile wallet. Good job, gang. Excited for more great things from Airbitz to come.

Best out there for mobile. SDK is the easiest bitcoin platform to code with as well.

Airbitz. You can even have the person you're setting up skip the create password screen to speed up signup even more. Fastest wallet setup and most private mobile Bitcoin wallet for iOS or android. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 17:23:23
Siiiiiiiiiick. So excited for these optimizations.

Only ways to lose all your coins with Airbitz are:
1) forget your username and password and recovery answers, _and_ lose access to the device on which you previously logged in.
2) skip the create password part upon account creation (Airbitz allows this to speed up onboarding/setup, but notifies everyday until user creates a pw), and then either delete the app or lose the device before creating a password.
Bottom line, create a solid password and don't forget your username and password, and if so you'll be able to login on any device (note that using device-lock "one-touch 2FA" adds some wrinkles to this, along the lines of added security). If Airbitz disappears, you still have complete control of your funds and can send out a transaction to another wallet you control. Airbitz never has access or knowledge about your account. Tops in privacy and security for a mobile wallet. My favorite wallet by a good margin.
