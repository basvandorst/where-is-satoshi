To save time, I have to use a 3rd party software to print paper wallets. But to save money, be free from banking and authority, I have to learn how to manage my wallet myself, which takes up more time. Which do I pick? Convenience or security? I can't have both? Maybe large BTC balances in my secure, self-managed wallet, and my convenient 3rd party digital wallet for smaller balances? With conventional bank accounts, I don't have to transfer money between accounts just to buy a latte. 
Freeing up resources to work on what? Skill-less people can't do anything besides skill-less work, and America's given that away, which fucks everyone over, even the skilled ones. 
"Intellectual dues to work and enjoy bitcoin", that is a resource that I apply at work and my personal life, which can't be tied up with figuring the next best way to store my digital wallets. 
I accomplished nothing at 4 years old, but if I had the bitcoin community as my family, they would be bragging about how I cured cancer before it even happened.

You forget that in order to work, people have to buy things. And if people don't buy things, you won't have a job. Except as a miner, in the bitcoin realm. But even that has its limitations

Yes, greed is the only reason why bitcoin enthusiasts hope to see it adopted as a replacement for the dollar. Bitcoin has it's place, but it's over-hyped.

Or you could just write a cheque and courier it to the recipient. Or western-union, that fee you spent using fiat currency on western union saves you time from securing your digital wallet with 3 passkeys split up in paper format all over your house.

The title is the TL;DR ;)
In all seriousness, bitcoin is flawed from the inside and out, and bitcoin enthusiasts/investors are hyping it up and making stuff up so they can profit from it. Because it's unregulated, false advertising regulations do not apply.

Yes, I completely agree with you! Right now, a low-level e-commerce solution. Or high value, low volume transfers. But the latter is more labour intensive. If time is not an issue, then maybe it's worth spending it on transferring via bitcoin instead of other methods.
