Their plan was always wait and see if it fails, like so many of the forks before. At $300 a pop it would be stupid not to add support. I'm not sure how many btcs were left in coinbase, but even just a few 100 would make it worth adding support, just for those who want to withdraw through coinbase (and since they've added other coins in the past, I'd assume they're getting good at it).
Also, on a side note, fuck that 10 minute limit. Like I can't think of two worthwhile posts in 10 minutes?

I left my .1 btc in coinbase as I figured Bitcoin Cash should crash. Still not sure why it didn't. It's hashing support is extremely low, and disproportional to it's current value vs bitcoin.
Also, how did, what, 16 million coins? Come in to fruition at $300 a pop from day 1. The speculation in crypto is just insane...

Huh? If they're trying to analyze traffic, encryption stops them. If they're blocking ports, a vpn stops them. Please make an effort to learn what your talking about.

Dividends? From where? I was in the Pirate scheme at 7% interest a week before. Was in for 10 weeks then pulled out 2 days before he went belly up :D

You sir, are an extremely boring troll. L2troll better.
Plus the maximum size of block is 1MB. So 1MB/10minutes comes out to about 1.7KB/s (rounding up). So even if your throttled for going over your bandwidth cap (for downloading 5GB a month mind you, you truly are an idiot), you only need 1.7KB/s or more to keep up with the chain.
Dumb ass.

Shit your right you found the major flaw in bitcoin. Bandwidth. Why did no one ever think about this before, everyone on earth has a cap of only 100GB a month, if the bitcoin chain increases too much, no one, not a single person!, will be able to update the blockchain!
Your a genius, I'm selling off all my bitcoins right now, thank you.

Some do not all, please don't go generalizing like that. Though they could always just change it so the data sent to nodes is encrypted, uses a popular port like 80, or use a vpn.

Holy fuck because year calling you retarded was the only thing I said. And yes, throttling is not usually used by isps in America, if you go over the cap they either don't care or shut you off. Unless you're taking about wireless for some reason. Also, please shut the fuck up, we both know that in the past I first responded too you were taking about isps throttling bitcoin.
Fucking dumb ass.

Wow. I guess poe's law is true.

No one thinks an entire country should use bitcoin, that's a big part of the issue here. Your creating an argument about nothing.
@_date: 2013-07-08 17:33:35
Oh your retarded and mean data caps and the throttling that would come after you hit them. When the rest of the world hears throttling, they think of how bittorrent, use net, and video streaming may be throttled by the isp. And rereading your initial post, this is obviously what you meant in regard to your initial mentioning of throttling bitcoin, so you truly are retarded. 
You lost son, let it die.

Why do you have 5 upvotes those two things aren't even related. Someone could have a million dollars in bitcoin and still not need the entire blockchain.
