My process is: My Bank -&gt; Dwolla -&gt; Mt. Gox -&gt; BTC
Getting money from banks to dwolla can take a bit of time (depending on the practices of the bank) and going from dwolla to Mt. Gox takes a day or two. 
You just have to be willing to keep a chunk of money with dwolla or Mt. Gox. I don't really trust Mt. Gox to hold money so I keep a small amount there for purchases I want to make quickly and transfer out BTC as soon as I get them.
Dwolla will also "loan" you $500 (I think that's the correct amount) if you join a $3/mo plan they have so that you can use some money instantly instead of waiting for money from your bank. 
Hopefully this will simplify your purchases in the future.

As far as I understand it, we can treat btc like just about anything else (cash, gold, silver etc). If we have records of the transactions, convert immediatly to USD and keep track of which btc transaction relates to which products being sold we shouldn't have problems with the taxman, and we wouldn't have to give up the cash-like anonymity features of btc.
I could definatly be mistaken about this which is why we're also taking dwolla and stripe. Great insight though.

We had thought about ways to incentivize use of bitcoins. We plan to be a local shop first then expand to online orders so I'm sure we'll come up with a "use btc and get x item free" type of deal. 
We're not sure how much interest we'll have from customers yet but we are very serious about using btc as a payment system.

Maybe a few as novelty items, the markup on casascius is already pretty high, we'd have a hard time generating profit (I think) even if we just sold them for melt value.
Really, I'd be totally on board with bitbills if they hadn't been so infrequent with the updates about the main product. I'm really disappointed with bitbills, at one point they seemed to have all thier ducks in a row but now they seems to have disappeared.

We plan to launch a more formal page soon. A goal for the site is to integreate everything from the inventory system to the prices displayed online as both BTC and USD. We still have some more formal planning to do but we will have BTC all over the site.

I think this is excellent. This plus the article referenced  make the future look very bright for bitcoin.
The market has been stable for months and has weathered growing pains, wide-spread adoption isn't so much of a pipe dream now.

That's a new product to us, thank you for sharing. That is definatly something we'd be interested in advocating / selling.
Edit: Read more details about the hexayurt, this is excellent and right in line with what we want to advocate.

Another redditor voiced interest in the same thing. I had only considered operating a bitcoin exchange (middle man between the buyer and mtgox really) as an edge case but it may be worth some more consideration.
I like the idea, I think I could be upfront and simple with pricing. What sounds like a fair service fee? 5%?
