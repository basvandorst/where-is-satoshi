I have never clicked on links in e-mail. There is a huge opportunity to hacking my wallet and stealing my BTC. Be careful!
@_date: 2014-12-04 16:15:31
would you really do it for 2 btc? 
btw I don't think a hundred tries will guarantee that you win.
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:52:24
No it doesn't. Bitcoin is a great and well designed currency so that's why a half of that is impossible in Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-07-17 07:19:49
Wow. I'm in! 
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:55:11
I've heard that Electrum built doesn't work

I am skeptical about the MSc Digital currency, based in Cyprus. But I'll be happy to follow its development.

Seems that every politician in USA has a twitter account

I'm glad Bitcoin meetings held around the world. I hope you'll share interesting materials from the meeting here.
@_date: 2014-07-17 07:23:31
Which is actually not in China

With Armory, you have a complete copy of the blockchain on your system. With Electrum, you do not. Electrum requires you to trust others to provide a true copy of the blockchain.
Ergo, Armory is more secure than Electrum.
Only you can decide whether the risk/reward is worth it.
My Armory install secures much more bitcoin than does my Electrum install.

How come? Phrasing! 
@_date: 2014-07-17 07:18:40
It's better to say that this is a new meaning of the word "cool"
@_date: 2014-07-17 07:04:56
I agree. We are crazy about "51 % fiasco" but we should let BTC to be on it's own! 
@_date: 2014-07-17 07:21:59
Should i say "Happy Birthday"?
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:51:19
Agree. But your comment will be downvoted, man. Just because someones doesn't agree that Aplle sucks
@_date: 2014-05-21 13:09:12
I think it's wonderful cos Bitcoin becomes available worldwide!
@_date: 2014-04-30 05:44:08
I think that's great. This lets Bitcoin develops. Why do you think someone of students would steal? You can't  think bad about all the people except you/
Yes, the system is imperfect.  But hackers always trying to be eliminated and  protection of the system is improving.

I don't understand why CTTSO lists "Bitcoin" in research Bid topics? US government decided to consider Bitcoin as competitive system, isn't it?
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:44:13
There's a lot of people who will find this useful. Nice article
@_date: 2014-05-01 19:59:15
IMO the most essential resource for Bitcoins are it's followers. the Second the most important is the technical equipment and the third and very important resource is the trust (from the government and the people etc)
@_date: 2014-06-22 02:45:05
Great news! How many Bitcoin ATMs are located Australia now?
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:47:31
Some people said that the main problem with gold, silver or bitcoin is getting companies to accept it. 
BUT! Every day one new company accepting Bitcoin, which means that this problem will be solved in a few years IMO
@_date: 2014-07-17 07:15:00
Get ready, Costa Rica, i'm coming! 
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:25:54
Success Council is a scam organization that wants nothing other than your money. They market themselves as a way to "protect your money", sound familiar? Yeah, it's the same service banks offered in the earliest days of banking. They are not even the first PoW trolls.
These clowns are implying Bitcoin's SHA256 security isn't already good enough. This guy says Bitcoin holders pay for mining through inflation, but that's not what's happening. Without the miners, the bitcoin network has ZERO security and we all lose our coins anyway.
Basically this clown thinks he is smarter than Satoshi, if he really is there's nothing stopping him from creating his own altcoin that will be superior. So why doesn't he do that? Because he's full of shit.
@_date: 2014-07-17 07:13:36
And we too. That's why we are here! 
@_date: 2014-07-17 07:23:03
They made a history, guys. Freaking Bitcoin history
@_date: 2014-09-02 07:51:19
I'm not a huge fan of Coinbase. Plenty of people have been having problems with it for me to take my business elsewhere. Coin.mx seems like a good alternative, though.
@_date: 2014-05-02 16:38:23
I've never liked Akon but now I began to respect him. He says the right things. Bitcoin is a symbol of the innovative future so it's necessary to support system's development.
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:50:31
Then go and buy one.

Warning wich contain the gift card... wow, i can't understand how this world works
@_date: 2014-04-30 05:56:40
Where do you live? 
You're very lucky with the open-mind headmaster .
I'll reccomend to put the ATM there. It will greatly simplify your life and save your money cos some transactions using bitcoin is cheaper than through the banks.
@_date: 2014-07-17 07:14:19
Casinos in Las Vegas are world famous, but Bitcoin pool - is not. Got it?
@_date: 2014-07-17 07:02:51
"51% fiasco" is very credible threat but no one can explain what will happen exactly 
@_date: 2014-04-30 06:07:24
Your videos are great! Well done!
I wish to see it when I hear about bitcoins first time. 
Keep up the good work! 
Pls tell  how your Bitcoin talk at Harvard was passed.
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:51:45
Thanking Banking sounds like a not a good rhyme but your message is quite nice
@_date: 2014-06-22 02:44:13
I'm surprised that Overstock began to take Bitcoin. Does anyone know when they started accept BTC?
@_date: 2014-05-21 13:06:42


This is the best side to using BTC for me
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:55:27

Honk Kong is China, isn't it?
@_date: 2014-08-23 06:45:01
Now we can feel the history with our Bitcoins. NICE! 
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:54:49


Pls can you explain why?
@_date: 2014-05-01 19:49:12
It would be nice if "The front page of r / bitcoin in 10 years." realized after 2 years. 
  I like the idea of acceptance  Bitcoins by Greece as relevant currency. Maybe this will be the best way for them to out of debt
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:48:05
It's very funny! 
I especially liked the topic "US President says he will switch US economy over to Bitcoin if he gets enough online signatures and Facebook likes "

How exactly one becomes a person of the year? Adam Back is really cool I think.

No they don't. Stop being rude. It's BTC community! 
@_date: 2014-07-17 07:20:50
You can't even imagine what can you get with your 0.005 btc! 
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:14:17
As far as I can see, PAYPAL integrating with bitcoin is a good thing for bitcoin.  It means broader exposure and more changes to use it.  What would the negative be?
@_date: 2014-05-01 19:39:11


That's it! It's time to change rules of the game. Banks and middlemen have lost all sense of proportion in relation to commissions for  transactions and interest on loans. 
Go China! Go Bitcoin!

Can i spend my BTC to buy  3D printer to prin another 3D printer? 
@_date: 2014-07-17 07:21:35
You should invent a new hashtag

I think serious upheavals  course of Bitcoins are expected in July
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:05:53
In NC the drug paraphernalia charge is more serious than a misdemeanor possession because the law does not distinguish between a weed pipe or a crack pipe. All paraphernalia is lumped in together. Maybe its different in VA.
@_date: 2014-07-17 07:05:22
Perhaps, whole idea
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:54:47
They should be scared. They are a shitty company that steals and locks accounts for no reason. I haven't seen any attack ads personally but the one listed on that site is weak.
Hopefully Google Wallet and Apple Pay will take away their grasp on online payments and p2p transfers.
