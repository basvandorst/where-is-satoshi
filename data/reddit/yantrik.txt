If you want to make money , then you need patience. Wait and wait and wait some more, and pounce when pessimism is at its best. if its 50 % down, then let it go down some more and even more. Coming months are not good for the crypto so please wait.

Their rational is illegal flow of money outside India. So let's say I buy 1 bit coin in INR and take it outside India and sell it for .50 USD, that means our dollars go outside , and this can lead to rupee getting stronger and hurting our exports. People here are blaming government but our govt has its hands tied, we need dollars as reserve to buy huge quantities of oil and arms and ammunition and other goods and we can't risk this flow outside India. It's a simple logic where short term need trumps long term benefits.

Dude do you know difference between accident and technical competence?  It's like saying that after the Challenger crash some Russian trolls comes up and says "these dam Yankees not know how to land a spaceship"

On the contrary India banning it puts a hummer. Time is going to be real rough for some time , so a real investor need to wait , load his cash and wait and wait and wait some more. When pessimism is at rs height then you need to pounce. So wait and let panic be your friend.
