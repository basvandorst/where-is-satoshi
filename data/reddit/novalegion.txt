How do you pay off debt when not enough money exists to pay it off
@_date: 2018-11-27 02:08:16

Make it happen you mad lad
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:37:22
Doesn't matter you still owe him the coin

Gosh that hurt just looking at it
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:49:46
I've never been in debt nor will I ever be. However, I believe the credit card system preys on those who aren't responsible. You can gain a little off of it with responsibility, or you could lose everything and ruin your life with debt.

lol this has got to be sarcasm

dolla tweny five
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:48:19
Then why did you take the bet? Pay him back. You can bounce back from lost money easily. But regaining integrity is next to impossible.
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:48:10
It's a system that preys on the weak.
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:18:05
so tired of hearing about articles that know absolute shit about bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:15:48
How do you ban something that you have no control over whatsoever. This is the drug war all over again xD
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:14:01

@_date: 2018-12-12 14:19:11
Pretty sure the population has gone down because they keep murdering each other.
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:36:45

@_date: 2018-12-12 14:43:43

If it looks like a scam, smells like a scam, sounds like a scam. It's a scam.
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:30:57
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:24:05
Why does everyone say bitcoin is an anarchists dream. Imagine blockchain voting machines.

@_date: 2018-12-07 03:02:40
You people say it's like gold. Gold performs well in recession.
@_date: 2018-12-12 19:19:58
Credit cards wouldn't exist if people were responsible with them.

@_date: 2018-12-12 14:34:20
I love how people think they can predict this thing
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:02:50
I always thought exchanges were idiotic. Blockchain is meant to be unhackable, yet the coins get hacked because the exchanges don't use it. smh
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:40:25
Why do you think I'm here. I'm riding out the storm
@_date: 2018-12-12 19:09:18
Credit cards are stupid.
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:24:44
Well considering we put politicians there it's really not the same thing.

@_date: 2018-12-12 18:10:20
Do you have intent of paying it in the future?
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:21:53
If you're really this worried. Stop looking at the price and come back next year.
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:08:33
1.5% is lower than the inflation rate
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:20:45
So basically, you don't understand how biased the U.S. media is
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:11:43
tl;dr coinbase is a scam
