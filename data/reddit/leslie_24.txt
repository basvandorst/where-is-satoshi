Youll have to rely on a picture of a singular Minecraft block of bedrock in a white backdrop when it pops. All of you bout to go 2x before Bitcoin has an erectile dysfunction stabbed with forks and suicidal posts. God its gonna be terrible..

Virwox if you're in a rush. You'll end up dragging your money through ridiculous fee's but I still flippes a profit on BTC so i'm not complaining. Just get it done.

Here I was excited over my 400$ investment in mid April LOL
@_date: 2017-05-08 22:52:21
I bought 400$ worth of Bitcoin in mid April and I remember on like the 5th of May looking at my wallet and realizing I made profit even with 5% conversion fee's. I might just put a fraction of my savings in to BTC because in all honesty you'll never lose your money with a close enough eye. I just wish I wasn't broke back in 2013 when I was a kid while just learning about Bitcoin and gambling with free doge coins.. good times ^_^.
