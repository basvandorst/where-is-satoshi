Ltc is ahead of the pack on about everything their actually waiting on others 4 things like atomic swaps
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:51:48
Plus mast is coming soon and segwit is safer than just increasing blocksizes like bcash plus they already done lightning transactions so that will b soon which will make btc ltc safer than now and they already have the safest thing n the world literally and fast as shit n cheap as shit 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:27:59
Pretty sure its just code on the chain (math)not a 3rd party 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:14:33
Heard abouy it havent had the time to read up on it isnt suppose to b a platform coin to
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:45:01
Where u switch between any coins with atomic swaps without having to go on an exchange is a crude explanation. Think shapeshift without the 3rd party to depend on strictly p2p R blockchain2blockchain. So say u want 2 buy something but all u have is ltc n they only accept btc u can send ltc it will tranfer it btc atomatically

Actually the 20 trillion is just 4 starters more like 60t r if u count unfunded liabilities like -220t so i dont know where u get the info from but if u look at usdebtclock i owe bout a cool million if u count my kids and wife debt cause im the only one workin considering i only make 40k a year i say us is doomed and getting r asses handed 2 us bu china an russia
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:24:18
I agree if u look at what chinas doing with the 1 belt 1 road, bypassing the london gold fix with the Shanghai gold exchange, now a yuan oil future backed by gold bypassing the petrodollar keeping U.S out of syria with russia now north korea and 4 us navy ships have been taken down this year alone sounds fishy. If u step back and take a look on micro level there totally in control of their country albeit tyrannically but on macro scale their kinda of the good guyz. Theirs no way their giving up the strong hand in the crypto world just trying to get ahold of the wealth trying to leave the country. I mean why ban exchanges but not crypto r mining to me its pretty obvious wats going on but 2 each his own i guess i bought in on the bottom (ltc) personally i think were bout to get another run up

S2x is the hard fork on august 1st were btc split btc with segwit and bcash now btc with segwit is going 2 try n double there block size from 1mb to 2mb to scale but lot of people dont want it and say we dont need it yet now that we have segwit let it get implemented then later we scale block size im not a tech person so i dont know all i know  is segwit hasnt really been implemented that much maybe like 10% so id say lets implement it then see if we need to scale lot pf people like hardforks cause if u held btc u got as much bcash so basically free money

Wrong we r the govt boss we the people should decide wat laws we want dictating over us us should go back to gods law aka the constitution  and leave this meratime law aka kings law behind us in the blockchain dust and if we decide to pay taxes 4 like roads education  ports military it should be local to stop as much waste as possible. Its strange to think this wau i know but it would unleash the greatest growth an prosperity in human history
@_date: 2017-09-09 03:36:21
Theres no law that says we HAVE to pay taxes it is voluntary the saying  the only 2 things r dwath n taxes r both false we should never pay taxes (bases of american revolution an constitution)and physics proves we never actually die

Look I dont agree w 2x im saying blocks can hold more if more people implemented segwit 
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:36:45
I agree btc will have to scale to b used worldwide but segwit is only like 10% implemented right now plus when the blocks were full wasnt most of it spamming to cause to look like they needed to scale and 4 higher tx fees? Legit question i dont know and why only 2x why not 8x with difficulty algo like bth that would make them like obsolete and why no replay?
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:56:59
Buy any 3 on coincase i prefer ltc cause of almost instant free transaction cost. Move to trezor r ledger. Software wallets r way better than exchange but if you run ios r google facebook youtube apps on your phone r computer they watch and listen to everything you do on there including text phone conv. Online banking hell camera and mics r on all the time so they snooping on EVERYTHING u do and say so trezor r ledger. Then if u want 2 swap for another coin say eth btc go to shapeshift r likes and swap put back on hw. Then educate yourself about internet safety. Firefox duckduckgo tor router socks tails vpn. ��good luck c on the moon

Maybe us blockchain user's think the blockchain is us using r ballot box since we all know voting in this country for any of the parties is just a sideshow now days and is the only real wau we can speak r minds

1. U dont need exchanges u can buy directly from  miners r peers hence p2p currency
2.we dont need mass adoption if u really believe govt r trying to go cashless which they r sort of ,they need cash to run their drug cartels and 2 fund terrorist aka aCIAda, but  u wont care about price of btc r like cryptos at that point u be begging 4 any way out the system
3.this cashless society system will b ran on a blockchain im certain of it
Theres 3 good points u should atleast consider

I have trezor split 1month after chain split got equal btc bth. As 4 eth it is chain split but its not contentious so no one will really want.to.mine the old chain im not tech savy but that's the way i understood it 
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:59:11
Its activated but only like 7% of transactions implement it from what i read? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:24:09
Im not a tech guy but why cant we fully implement segwit then later once blocks get full again go to 8mb w difficulty algo n just wipe out bcash? Truly a question i dont know and u sound like your on top of things
@_date: 2017-09-26 21:45:06
It takes 1000+ dollars in computing power to produce it like gold and silver getting mined hence why they call it fucking mining u moron

Ltc is awesome to with ln segwit mast a swaps colored coins fast and cheap.
