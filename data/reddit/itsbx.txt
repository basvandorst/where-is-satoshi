What if you just delete the app...  store the key words.  Wouldn't that be "cold" storage ?
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:37:53
If you change to swegit. Can u go back to legacy if it doesn't work out ?

Does copay's 12 word seed work in electrum ?  What other wallets does it work in?  
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:23:18
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:51:45
I see. Thanks for the recommendation but I'm scared to use copay based on all the comments I've been reading. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:29:09
This is a little bit concerning.   Is copay a wallet we should not be using ?
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:50:10
What about *
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:42:44
What do you think about it 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:45:18
Are the 12 and 24 words considered your keys?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:43:46

@_date: 2017-12-26 07:37:17
Hmmmmm 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:06:41
And I thought segwit2x didn't got through.  Is the regular account different?
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:24:02
lol 
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:10:29
Very misleading graph 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:45:14
Are there any drawbacks to going segwit
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:40:20
What do you do when u have coins on copay prefork?

Korbit level 4 here
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:17:20
You are awesome.  So bread wallet and or copay 12 word seed can be imported into electrum?  I been reading about copays issues....  also I need to get access to bch and bgold.  Very nerve wrecking considering my btc transaction hasn't confirmed in 24 hrs
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:05:48
Weak ass 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:42:58
Korbit.co.kr see for yourself 
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:32:54
I mean.  Does this effect the coins in anyway ?  
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:58:14
Based on what ?
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:44:20
Lol. How much credit card limit do you have. Like $5000. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:05:18
Where can I read up on the benefits or negative from legacy or segwit?  Do I have to send the coins to segwit before splitting?
Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:19:29
Just wait. It will confirm 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:17:19
I only ask because it didn't recognize the segwit address 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:14:37
Listen when I say... the short interest. Even large only has a small way down....   the potential of gains is infinite.  The potential for shorts is relatively small. Especially with everyone on the sidelines ready to buy up cheap coins.  So don't be afraid. Don't have a weak hand.  And just hodl boys.  Don't let the short term price fluctuations make you sell. Hold this for dear life.  They are going to pump the shit out of Bitcoin and the demand is super high.  We are in for a treat.   So hold on to your winners. 2021 is right around the corner.   
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:49:48
What's this 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:47:00
Hi. I looked at your post history and you seem like you try to help people with some issues. Do you have any experience with this. I am concerned about copay and do not know what to do. Considering it was preforked coin I am sorta lost as to what I should do.  Why electrum?  Would I be able to recover both btc bch and bgold?
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:55:26
How do you claim bch and bgold
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:08:49

Youre dumb. Fiat dropped the gold standard long time ago

Ok. Go to korbit.co.kr  take the price and do the currency conversion....  
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:46:28

@_date: 2017-11-29 02:43:08
I can arbitrage it for you. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:20:11
Lol. Post the pic 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:14:00
I do it now on korbit.  10-14%
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:27:49
 I would think this would cause a panic buy situation but that's just my opinion.
