aaand coinmama does not serve my state of Oregon, so rule them out.
BitMex does not serve USA yet
etherdelta is just for ethereum
changelly similar to shapeshift. based in EU.
luno just a wallet for btc - no good with other currencies or accepting usd easily (maybe wire but I couldn;t see instructions or easy way to start)

In case anyone else stumbles across this thread, to save you the time here are the ones I have looked into and ruled out:
USA-based: Paxful, Kraken, Bittrex, GDAX, Poloniex, Gemini
Assuming tight US allies will cooperate with the US govt, ruling out:
Based in EU: Bitstamp, etoro, CEX.io, HitBTC, bitcoin.de, Bitbay, indacoin
S.Korea: bithumb
Mexico: bitso
Assuming potential enemies of the US (where I live) are too risky:
Chinese based: Bitfinex (Hong Kong), Binance
Russian: yobit
Not available in USA: IQ Option
Still need to look into: 
cryptopia, ~~changelly~~, blockchain, ~~Luno~~, ~~Coinmama~~, bitflyer, btcmarkets, coincheck, bx.in.th, bitcoin.co.id, zebpay

I'm on data, preparing for my Y2K party.  No time to read your comment.

Getting a deeper, second look: bitmex, bisq.io, bitstamp.net, etherdelta

great article, thanks for the link

You can't buy coin with regular currency like USD there, so have to do that transaction elsewhere then send the btc to Binance account to trade.

Um, yeah, that is weird.  And +1 for a (potentially) technical topic in here ;)

thanks, but looking for an exchange, not person to person meetups (convenience)

This research is tough.  For instance Bitfinex was looking decent, based in British Virgin Islands which is not part of the EU, but then look deeper and parent company is iFinex which is based in Hong Kong.  Convoluted access for a US agency it looks like, but not a fan of that proximity to Chinese influence.

very interesting for trades and buying, reading more.
They have no wallets though, so would need to find one that meets the privacy haven idea.... know any?

Follow-up request: if none exist, can one of you new bitcoin millionaires buy Sealand and set one up? ;) 
Or someone have a little time to organize and crowdfund the purchase? (not joking)

Took me months to get my coin back after I lost my phone used in 2FA - not because it was difficult but because customer service was shit.  And this was in 2016 before all the craziness - I would avoid them.
