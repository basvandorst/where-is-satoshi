I just watched the lightning network explained video and I have some questions about Lightning Network.
I'm having trouble understanding how the lightning network is going to speed up transactions/reduce fees. So won't you have to keep a channel open with say "Amazon" as long as you want to pay them and that whole time your money is tied up?
Does the lightning network automatically route the transaction from peer to peer, like a larger blockchain running paralell to the current one? 
I also have a bitcoin cash question, why did bitcoin cashers not adopt segwit when they hard forked? So they increased the blocksize (which i think probably makes sense is right) but they didn't implement SEGWIT2. 
Also ya can someone explain why increasing the blocksize is good/bad/doesn't actually matter. Isn't the point of bitcoin to have a spendable money that is nearly instant? Would BTC benefit if we increased the blocksize? Or are there strains that would create that Im not thinking off (total blockchain size for EX)
Also when bitcoin cash was created, that means they minted 100% of all bitcoins again as "bitcoin cash" (read Bcash aaay) so doesn't that drive down the value of their currency? Because there's already 16M coins in circulation owned by other people?
Thanks for reading.

responding to your response to my first question.
Isn't centralizing the payment processing bad?
As far as the potential to aggregate power/money to a central locations.
Doesn't that run the risk of regulation IE local bitcoin banks etc)?

Can we talk about USDT?
Does anyone actually believe these tethers are backed?
On their own website it even says you can't redeem them for cash.
1.1Trillion&gt;USD in supply? 
I understand that as long as the exchanges honor their value to each other there's no problem.
But, if they(btifinex etc) don't have the actual USD/commodities to back their tethers and that information goes public, won't that cause a massive crypto crash?
Please change my view if you disagree but this looks bad.
E: Downvotes but no responses? I'm not claiming to know the answer.

I just want to thank you for Bitcoin. I'm sorry about the poor way the community is reacting to Rumors about your identity. It's ironic that a community that Prides themselves on anonymity and the protection of rights isn't doing more to put a stop to this. I feel really bad for Dorian, he is a victim  here. I'd like to take this time, however, to thank you for your contribution.
EDIT: I highly recommend to prove you are legitimate to Reddit, you perform an action only Satoshi" can do, such as the above mentioned moving a block award coin to a new address. I suggest you post proof of this, that should be sufficient verification.

You guys are having a pretty pointless argument, IMO.

Gonna get downvoted into oblivion but i don't care. Fucking Hilarious. Keep trusting a 3rd party with your money. Keep getting scammed, you have noone to blame but yourselves.

THE WORLDS EMAIL ENCRYPTION SOFTWARE? I'm sorry but bullshit. Most Email platforms Do not use this. Now i think what hes doing is admirable and I definitely support him but the title of this article is simply not correct. You need to do some serious research on email encryption protocol and realize that his code is not the "worlds" encryption software, its just one used by privacy enthusiasts. Again, this software is pretty good, and I think we should be backing this guy. If memory serves this is used by Mozilla and thats huge, but you have to realize that a lot of people still use ISP provided email and aren't using gmail/other 3rd party services
