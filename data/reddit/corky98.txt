You need to recheck your sources. Sudan is sanctioned against because of ongoing conflict in Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile, and Darfur. This is a genuine civil war, or the remnants of one at least. Once stability is reached and an agreement has been settled with South Sudan on borders the sanctions will be lifted. ThIs has nothing to do with terrorism.
