here's one just in case...

Bitcoin, I love you
But you're bringing me down
Bitcoin, I love you
but you're bringing me down
Like the Chinese miners rack space
pulling minimum wage
Bitcoin, I love you
But you're bringing me down
Bitcoin you're slower
And you're wasting my time
The blockchain all shows
You are filthy but fine
But they shuttered your stores
When they opened the doors
To the cops who were bored
Once they'd run out of crime
Bitcoin, you're perfect
Don't please don't change a thing
But you’re fundamentally flawed
with no consensus on scaling
So the boring collect
I mean all disrespect
In the online forums
I'd once spammed with memes
Bitcoin, I love you
But you're freaking me out
There's a ton of the twist
But we're fresh out of shout
Like a gdax margin call
That crushes buy walls
Bitcoin, I love you
But you're freaking me out
Bitcoin, I love you
But you're bringing me down
Bitcoin, I love you
But you're bringing me down
Like a death of the heart
Jesus, where do I start?
But you're still the one pool
Where I'd happily drown
And oh.. take me off your mailing list
For kids that think it still exists
Yes, for those who think it still exists
Maybe I'm wrong
And maybe you're right
Maybe I'm wrong
And maybe you're right
Maybe you're right
Maybe I'm wrong
And just maybe you're right
And oh..
Maybe biz told you true
And they're always be something there for you
And you'll never be alone
But maybe they’re wrong
And maybe I'm right
And just maybe they’re wrong
Maybe they’re wrong
And maybe I'm right
And if so, is there?
