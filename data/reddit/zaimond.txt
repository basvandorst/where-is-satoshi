Actually the Bitcoin cash chain is 18gb smaller than the core chain at the moment

I don't see a problem with an economy using Bitcoin and still collectively paying for healthcare, police, military, roads, schools. 
We could introduce a system where the customers pay VAT directly to the state when you purchase goods, direct tax payment when a company pays salaries. 100% transparency 24/7. 
If the IRS asks to see your records you can show directly to proof of payment on the blockhain.
It's just a much more efficient version of today's system with the added bonus of taking away the states ability to print money to fund wars. 
The transparency would work both ways. The people can see immediately what the state is using our money for.

No. BCH forked off the bitcoin blockchain. The "ledger" is identical up till block 478559. 1 btc before that block = 1 bch.

Assuming his computer uses 600w around the clock that is 0.6w*24h = 14.4 kWh/day. 
This panel produces about 240W and is 1.7 meter by 1 meter 
240w panels with 7 hours of daylight gives 1.68kWh pr day pr panel. He needs 14.4kWh/1.68kWh = 8.6 panels. 
9 panels is 15.3 square meters. 
Plus batteries to store power overnight.

Ah but what if one chain ends up with 94% of hashingpower and the other ends up with just 6%? Miners wouldn't get paid because blocks take 200 minutes to mine until the next difficulty adjustment. Meanwhile transactions are going through smoothly and for much cheaper than before on the 2x chain. 
I realize core can hardfork a pow change or emergency difficulty readjustment of some sort but I fear for core if this happens. And I really don't want to lose core. I'm worried to say the least.

Coincap.io says the current average transaction fee is Average Fee
$2.62 (4th october 20:17 CET)
 says the current best fee is 140sat/byte. Normal transaction is about 220 bytes if i recall correctly. Thats about 1,3 usd/transaction
 says the current best fee is 128sat/byte, thats about 1,2 usd/transaction. 
My Jaxx wallets wants to charge me 4,2 usd fee right now at the lowest fee setting. My breadwallet is charging me 1,02 usd. Bitcoin.org advertises "Low processing fees" that's a god damn lie right now. Segwit enabled solutions might change this in the future, but its not low fees right now.

This is a lie. 
Interview with Jeff;
"Is the plan to replace Bitcoin Core?
Absolutely not. This is a patchset on top of Bitcoin Core. We'll use the best of Bitcoin Core, and we very much welcome those contributions, but also other contributions as well.
We want to work with Bitcoin Core, not against Core. Even if they disagree with us working with them, we want to work with them.
That’s what’s so amusingly ironic. The original SegWit authors are doing everything that they can to delay the rollout of SegWit, which is what Segwit2x is actually accomplishing."
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:14:12
Cheapest is online exchanges. If you don't want to deal with online exchanges (there are many options, look [here]( then localbitcoins is the second best but they charge more. 
Setup your trezor and bring a recieve adress to the seller. This can be printed to paper or a image on your phone or whatever. You get new receiving adresses for each transaction (they can be reused but it's not recommended).

Fees are at 2-4 usd/transaction. Working fine at the moment? Really?
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:40:17
BCH never activated segwit. S2x is a compromise core should accept. Fees are skyrocketing and all the segwit 2nd layer stuff is still in experimentation stage and far away from implementation

He says he spent it all back when he mined it
"The pizza thing was a lot more popular than I thought so I made good on as many trades as I could.  Other than a little bit of single digit change, I spent everything I mined.  As you all know, the difficulty rises to adjust to hashing power, so eventually the mining wasn't worth it for me."

I'll just copy/paste my last response. If you want regular normal people using this tech then whatever fee the wallet app sets is what people will use.

The point of that saying is simply, nobody knows but past performance indicates any time is a good time to buy unless you sell too early :p If you believe in the tech, just dollar cost average your way in by buying for X dollars every month for Y months

If bitcoin legacy can't keep its promise of low fees then bitcoin segwit2x wins. Its that easy. Core should merge 2x to avoid this split.

They have probably spent some, but some (or many?) of these transfers could have been to their own cold wallets.

My point is that if blocks take 200 minutes and miners need to wait for 100 blocks to spend blockrewards, and then another 6+ blocks for the coins to reach an exchange so they can get fiat to pay the powerbills, then thats 14 days+ waiting time vs normal 16 hours wait. 
Add to that users having to wait 200minutes x 6 blocks to get transactions through resulting in users panicing and not wanting to use the slow chain, and price dropping.
I don't see corechain surviving. I'd love to be proven wrong.

Fees are skyrocketing and slightly larger blocks fixes that for now. 2nd layer stuff enabled by segwit will come but it's not ready yet.
