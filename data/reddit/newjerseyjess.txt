I've actually already bought one of their QPAY pins at a ACE location near me. If you check their locations page on Libertyx.com.  It seems like LibertyX is in a ton of different stores.
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:13:08
A lot of bitcoin website have this now.... without all the funding. 
@_date: 2015-05-11 23:05:58
Hmmm, would like to see this get addressed, but i'm sure it will get downvoted out of existence by the same 100 accounts that upvote these btcquick advertisements once a week.
@_date: 2015-05-14 13:26:31
If you have locations near by Libertyx.com is the best. It's like local bitcoin without the risk.
@_date: 2015-05-09 14:27:03
And where would this go?
@_date: 2015-05-11 03:43:43
very cringe worthy.... couldn't finish it.
@_date: 2015-08-14 14:19:58
You got me.
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:18:04
Agree with circle and libertyx
@_date: 2015-08-15 01:48:58
Sick of idiotic zapchain quotes making it to the front page with typos in it. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 12:20:15
Check out rbitcoin.org

Well I don't think he meant bitcoin core the wallet was going to start doing KYC? If he did then I don't understand how one can think that would happen.
@_date: 2015-08-13 12:15:53
Libertyx.com is your best bet
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:03:01
Would the majority of miners not switch from whatever pool starting to require KYC? Or this is assuming they would all agree on it? 
@_date: 2015-08-14 19:07:08
Yes, they've been known to cut off accounts that buy drugs online.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:18:07


Like coinbase and circle have been doing for a year?
@_date: 2015-07-04 18:10:31
@_date: 2015-07-04 00:22:34
Can you suggest one? I have never used a web wallet.
@_date: 2015-08-19 18:04:53
Actually cooler then I thought it would be. Glad I watched.

"..only you can check your Bitcoin balance, view your transactions and make payments. "
@_date: 2015-07-01 16:47:34
Sweet, keep up the good work!
@_date: 2015-07-01 04:41:50
Can it be replaced with a image?
@_date: 2015-07-23 00:17:11
Is there a way to stream online?
@_date: 2015-07-01 22:13:04
I think they should be linking to tutorials on bitcoin... These people want to buy prostitutes, not join local bitcoin clubs.
@_date: 2015-04-14 17:42:48
Well, the site lets you post your own PR articles, what do you expect.
@_date: 2015-04-20 02:43:28
Agreed, does not get much easier than LibertyX.com
@_date: 2015-09-23 01:31:39
20 btc daily volume, is Canada's largest exchange? I hope that's not true.
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:44:48
I just did a dollar and it worked.
@_date: 2015-04-20 19:07:10
What?  I like telegram.
@_date: 2015-04-16 01:21:10
I would try it if they let you link any bank.
@_date: 2015-09-18 21:19:19
Fake testimonials, and one is from HashTalk (josh garza's paycoin scam forum).
Be careful
@_date: 2015-09-23 00:17:09
Who's we?
@_date: 2015-04-16 18:01:00
Are there any big bitcoin companies out of london?
@_date: 2015-04-02 20:10:29
I don't get why anyone would want to use it anyways.
@_date: 2015-09-23 14:45:31
I'd be careful with CoPay, I had a bad experience, although maybe I did something wrong.
About 2 months ago I downloaded the IOS app, and chrome app, and set up my wallet on both.
Sending worked fine from both for a month. Then the chrome app stopped working, so I just kept using the ios one.
Now I get this error on both: 
Here is my backup: 
If anyone can figure it out, the $6 is yours^^

This is a game?

Coinbase merchant account + coinbase exchange.
