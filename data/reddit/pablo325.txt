Some people are pushing for that, but BTC is pretty entrenched.   I also don't see why we should put an 'x' at the beginning just so we can fit in to the norm.  Bitcoin is already so different, f$&amp;@ the norm and their silly Xs

I agree with your thoughts on gambling sites.
When I was first entering the Bitcoin space, online gambling seemed like a killer feature of Bitcoin.  I played a game, won some.. then lost it...
That was my experience.  I then got much more interested in Bitcoin.  Continued investing in BTC, and have not touched a 'casino' since.
Maybe Ill get the bug again one day.  But for now I am a hodler.
Online casinos are a great idea though, and I feel there is space for some good businesses to do it.
@_date: 2014-11-25 17:59:13

Some merchants have minimum debit/credit transaction levels.  So yes, they will charge you extra just to pay with card.  It has to be up to the ~$3.00 mark, or whatever the $ value is.   I have seen this at a number of smaller stores.

When you read the article's description of the MintChip, it sounds like a direct copy of Bitcoin:


Please read altered version:
Bitcoin is founded on a direct asset transfer model that moves value between entities without the involvement of any intermediary. The transactions occur without the need for personal identification (thereby maintaining the user's privacy) and without the burden of third party processing. Bitcoin is based on advanced technology and a trusted protocol to allow for secure and easy value transfers between parties.  
@_date: 2014-09-20 01:15:09

Oh, an expert.  I get it now.
@_date: 2014-11-19 17:12:30
I see what you are saying, however; I don't see how it is right to say that those people need to grow up.  They just have strong beliefs
I think that... When people are financially invested, (even too much so) they will have a strong belief in Bitcoin.  This, combined with the cloak provided by the Internet leads to what he calls childish.  It's human nature what is happening, they don't need to grow up.  He has ignored all the factors that can lead to 'childish' behaviour online.  This is an online currency after all, all Internet related trends should be expected.
"To the moon!" etc etc A prime example of what will happen online but most likely not in a face2face setting.
@_date: 2014-08-25 17:30:27
"Entropy" on the shirt.  Also, if it said mycelium with the logo below the neck on the back of the shirt (smaller font and logo) that would be cool.  Just an idea.   Having 'Entropy' written on would be good though :)

@_date: 2014-05-10 04:09:10
The majority of businesses and miners, no?  There decisions will depend on the community though.  
I suppose Reddit acts as a platform for community driven direction.  However, Reddit does not act as a representative for Bitcoin outside of Bitcoin world.  the foundation is currently doing that.
@_date: 2014-09-04 00:51:34


"It is a direct copy of Bitcoin"
However; thank you for pointing out that I removed the word 'trusted'.
But... I think your point could easily be argued since we place much trust in the miners.  Remember the 51% scare?   That wasn't fixed at protocol level yet, so now we just educate miners and trust that they will make the appropriate decisions that will benefit everyone, themselves included.  The system rewards good actors.  It does not prevent bad actors.
@_date: 2014-11-24 21:18:11

They are correct, Bitcoin is what even Gold gets compared to in the future.  They must have posted that sign in the wrong year.
@_date: 2014-09-04 16:10:02
You do not remember all of the panic posts during the time? People were scared.  R/bitcoin was flooded with posts about ghash (I think it was them at the time).
There are arguments on both sides of whether the 51% is an actual problem or not.  
If I am incorrect, and there is no trust in the system... Then why do we rely on a pool to do "the responsible thing"?
This is trusting them to do the responsible thing *every time*.  Is it not?
I see your point, but there is clearly trust in the system.  Ignore it if you wish, but it is currently present.  
*If I am missing a big picture here please send me a pm to explain it to me, but I just can't wrap my head around us trusting the miners to do what is right.  It seems like trust to me.*

Shouldnt this 'fee' just be considered a cost of business.... DUH.   Then this kind of "fee" is just included in the price of the ticket - NOT an additional fee.

It has changed me in a sort of comical way.
Let me explain: most of the stuff I purchase online still requires a Credit Card.  
Whenever I purchase online with CC, I cringe.  I always think to myself; it is amazing that I am already a Bitcoin user, and these companies and most people are not yet.  It gets me laughing.  Either I am out to lunch, or the majority of society is.  Either way, I laugh.

They can store coins for you.  I created a new bitcoin address on onename.io.  I do not possess my private key.  I can, therefore, send bitcoins after I login from the wallet they provide.

@_date: 2014-07-29 13:54:23
Thanks for the info.  Seem interesting.   Why not just allow the user to recover the keys from the app should the company disappear?  (Show qr, scan/import privKey into other wallet service). 
Also, I genuinely found that joke funny.  -Sorry to all who lost funds there
@_date: 2014-07-21 19:15:55
I agree.  March though lol

Absolutely.  What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
Which coins would you want your school to support?   Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin off the bat?  I can see that you are a shibe 
@_date: 2014-11-18 19:20:56
I do not think I am.  So maybe he is talking about the 'Lunatic Fringe' of bitcoiners, He is still telling people to "grow up".  He is talking about bitcoiners that believe strongly in the technology.
Don't all bitcoiners believe strongly in the technology?  - I know that I wouldnt be here if I didnt.
That is a very   childish/immature/ridiculous   thing for him to say, and maybe it is him that should 'grow up'.
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:13:47
That's awesome!   best of luck with the captaincy. 
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:23:48

That is  awesome.  I had a great experience with Foldapp also.  Super fast and convenient
@_date: 2014-08-18 17:42:30
Blockr.io is my favourite.   Please treat it well coinbase.   I have no experience with you, but have heard good things.   Treat blockr.io with love and care :)
@_date: 2014-09-13 22:37:00
What if we start using blockchain technology to operate our locks on our doors?  Then we will have used up this name :S
I think 'wallet' is good.  It makes a lot of sense.  
No, the wallet isn't actually holding the bitcoins, but that doesn't matter.   The wallet functions like a wallet does.  To a user - one who doesn't care about private keys or the blockchain or any of that tech stuff, a 'wallet' is the perfect name.
Just my opinion :)
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:23:47

I'll have to find something else to do with these DVCs.
@_date: 2015-05-03 16:21:07
I used it this week also!  I thought it worked great, so did my friend :)
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:46:48
I think it is a fair singleing-out.  This is the biggest Bitcoin exchange, and since the fall of Gox, I have not seen them do anything to improve security.  -It is possible I missed an announcement or something.
But if, like you suggest, the biggest bitcoin exchange can't find the funds to hire a competent developer to work on security... wow.
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:23:05
Exactly.  
Unless you are DPR or one of the agents on the case, you don't really know which of those two conversations took place, and for which of the  alleged crimes.
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:04:04

Speaking of which:

Your mint tried this already and gave up.  Mint Chip was its name.
@_date: 2014-11-18 09:41:40
It is still a rude generalization.
@_date: 2015-01-10 02:04:53
Good question.  Id never thought about that.  
If you are depositing $, you are probably using an ATM owned by a bank.  My guess is that they just track who deposited which envelope?
@_date: 2015-01-21 05:33:27
Thanks for sharing.  I got a laugh out of that for sure!
@_date: 2015-01-11 02:50:31
Litecoin failed?
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:30:31
I do not assume anything, nor does my comment convey that I do.  I simply stated what I have observed.
Following Gox, Bitcoiners wanted a lot of improvements to security: audits, publicly auditable addresses, ETC..
Many exchanges made public statements that they would work towards this.  -Nothing was done.  Nothing changed.
This is what I am saying we have not seen yet.
@_date: 2015-01-08 17:42:06
Yes I have seen an ad.   Not terribly intrusive though.
@_date: 2015-01-03 04:33:27
The thread asked for my opinion on ChangeTip, I gave it.
I did not ask for a Bitcoiner's opinion on Litecoin.
Thanks though
@_date: 2015-01-11 06:31:07
copy/paste much?
But yes,  I'm with ya, bud.
@_date: 2015-01-15 05:54:40
Nope, not entrapment.   But yes, the ethics of undercover police.
Fooling DPR for a year.  
It is not clearly ethical or unethical.
Edit: On second thought; Entrapment could be present for some of the accusations, we do not know the exact conversations that took place.

You can remember the password in your brain.
@_date: 2015-01-18 17:44:43
Lol 'deleted' your account.  Those bastards made that impossible.  Just go log in, and BAM, your account is UN-deleted.
Get a friend to change your password, and then delete your account for you.  That would be the only way. sort of.
@_date: 2015-01-29 04:11:56
I've been texting the Ƀ symbol with my friends for a while.  It looks nicer than ฿, imho. 
I do really like the current Bitcoin logo though (slanted ฿ on orange) :D
@_date: 2015-01-06 22:26:19
lol thanks
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:58:37
It will be great when this hits iOS.
Note for Circle:
iOS app still does not allow input of BTC amount, only $ amount for sending.  App freezes up when trying to enter a BTC amount.
confirmed issue for iphone 4, iPad mini, iPhone 6.
@_date: 2015-01-06 21:09:46
Thank you !
@_date: 2015-01-17 01:56:13
Why don't they have visa and MasterCard up on the wall also?
@_date: 2015-01-18 18:16:28
Oh really?   I remember digging through settings forever trying to figure out how to fully delete it.  Good to know it is actually possible.  Thanks :)

Lol, you just made my night
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:03:13
Nice to see a generous user helped you out.  
Otherwise, the easiest method (IMHO) is to use 
You can link a Credit or even Debit card (if Visa or MC), and buy whatever $amount of BTC you need.
and oh yea; its 'BTC', not 'BC'.   
I hope you find Bitcoin to be convenient :)
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:09:14
Thanks for the love

@_date: 2015-01-20 05:19:06
Yes!  Depending on how the shipping works.  ie. do you send out a box with postage paid to put the books into.
@_date: 2015-05-14 01:25:24
Thanks so much :)
@_date: 2015-01-25 20:42:42
That is quite troubling... 
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:09:44
Lol  I'm curious of your reasoning..
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:07:03
Use circle.  With credit or debit card it is instant.  You can buy $5.00 if you want, but only up to 500 per week.
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:51:40
I think there are probably a lot of people that would like that feature lol
@_date: 2015-01-18 18:36:16
Except for the BTCe part.
Edit: and probably the part about the cat drinking lattes.
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:31:44

I think it shows that you are on the ball, and curious of all things related to your business.  A smart way to be.  It should make you look good to accept crypto.
@_date: 2015-09-24 17:44:32

@_date: 2015-09-02 15:28:41
I think terminology is perfect.
It's not extremely easy, but nor is Bitcoin to understand at first.
Also, Bitcoin is an awesome name. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 18:11:37
I think this is doable with Bitcoin also.

I agree.  Give users the option to use touchID and a pin.  Extra security.   It's so easy to rest a thumb on the button, let's combine it with a pin!
Enter ฿ amount-&gt;PIN-&gt;rest thumb-&gt; sent.
@_date: 2015-03-09 08:19:53
Oh really?   Is this a newer feature?  Or did I just miss it?  I haven't used bc.info in over a year
@_date: 2015-03-01 19:18:11
You should really mention what OS you are using.
BitScanner is a great app for iOS.
-Just scan the public QR code, and voila.
@_date: 2015-03-09 08:56:12
Okay, thanks so much. :)

Ƀ in text,
฿ looks good in image.
However; so does Ƀ 
@_date: 2015-03-12 06:32:17
Looks like a great service!   
Glad to see you are incorporating Litecoin as an alternative!  Doge is a nice touch also :)
@_date: 2015-03-02 19:29:57
Bitshares is a scam also.  Just witness whatever happened to bitshares-PTS. Or was it protoshares? ... Whatever it was, fuck those guys, and I can't believe how many players in the space still give them free publicity... Or they are all part of the BTS scam.
@_date: 2015-03-05 07:05:11

You are free to use whatever you want, it's your art.  You can't please everybody, nor should you try to :)

I don't understand it, myself.  This seems like a third party?  Every bitcoiner seems to want to trust this third party now?  When you figure it out, let me know haha.
@_date: 2015-03-10 04:10:14
to who?
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:02:07
Abandonment is a good description of what that company does.  Pump (PTS), dump/abandon, and move on to the next pump (BTS).
@_date: 2015-03-11 06:33:43
I don't claim to know anything about this situation, but maybe the gocoin CEO was conned by Garza, in which case people should stop with the defamation...

Why cant we use our PIN as a fall back if the TouchID fails, that with a custom PIN made for the wallet.   Wallets already allow custom PINs different from that of your Phone PIN.

I hope so!

I don't think you are talking about the same app, because there is most definitely not a pin code that a user can set.
@_date: 2015-02-13 05:07:12
I see what you mean.  Seems strange to not have a pin code.  Pretty basic security feature is say.

You are not alone.   I think the option should be PIN, TouchID, or both!  TouchID is so simple and easy, I'd opt for doing it right after I enter my pin.
  Enter ฿ amount-&gt;PIN-&gt;rest thumb-&gt; sent.
