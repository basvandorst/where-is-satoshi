WalletBit is the longest running Bitcoin wallet service in operation today. With the other wallet services, you do not get the same features and are putting your money in the hands of less experienced operators. You can risk paying hidden fees or even losing your funds with another wallet service but with WalletBit your funds are safe and you pay all your fees upfront. Those fees go towards making sure your funds are safe and to develop new features and enhance existing ones such as our Securecard.

If you only run MSE I would think malware is highly likely. I wouldn't trust it to keep anything safe.
@_date: 2012-11-08 17:46:18
We have also decided to extend the hours of our Bitcoin Friday sale to be inclusive for Bitcoin Fridays around the world. If it is Bitcoin Friday anywhere in the world, all transaction fees will be 50% off. This means you will pay just 0.445% on deposits or sales.

I have met personally with the staff at Canadian Bitcoins and can vouch for them being a legitimate business. I don't believe there is a simpler way to buy Bitcoins in Canada at the moment.
@_date: 2012-11-26 01:45:14
This is an awesome development. I suggest you keep an eye on WalletBit for Canadian-oriented solutions in the near future. Please take a look at our mobile checkout here  If you decide to use WalletBit in your restaurant we will be happy to promote your restaurant as the first brick and mortar store in Canada to use our service.
@_date: 2012-11-02 04:18:11
So has WalletBit. We not only offer merchant solutions but an online wallet service that requires no blockchain download.
@_date: 2012-10-22 02:47:43
It is not always cheaper to go with WalletBit and a transaction of 1BTC will illustrate it. For 1BTC the amount you would receive in BTC is 0.9851 with WalletBit  and 0.9901 with BitPay. In USD (at $12) that would be $11.12 with WalletBit and $11.68 with BitPay. 
However with WalletBit you can email, SMS and withdraw those bitcoins for free. Your USD balance is ready for investing and/or speculation which is not the case with BitPay. In addition, you also get use of our securecard technology free of charge.

I have seen many computers get viruses and malware not picked up by MSE. As Meshy said above me it doesn't matter how good your malware protection is if they are using 0day exploits or your software is out of date. Always update your software frequently, even if it is working fine.
@_date: 2012-11-02 02:33:12
There is a new promotional video at the bottom of the page. It helps to illustrate just how interchangeable WalletBit and ResponsePay are.

We encourage people to be creative with BitcoinCAPTCHA. For example, if BitcoinCAPTCHA is paired with a text CAPTCHA then there is a sort of 2 factor authentication process.  Solving 2 distinct types of problems makes it more challenging for spammers to operate.
@_date: 2012-12-23 19:26:55
Perhaps I explained that in a way that was confusing - Its' not $1 per challenge but a minuscule amount of bitcoin. The minimum amount is set to 0.0005 BTC by default but it can be configured in the script provided. This works out to about 7/10 of 1 cent at today's prices (excluding network the fee).
@_date: 2012-10-23 20:48:49
We prove your Bitcoins are safe by being the longest running Bitcoin wallet service in operation today. We opened in July 2011 and no other wallet service has kept your Bitcoins safe as long. For more details on our security protocols please see 
@_date: 2012-11-07 23:39:20
**There are no withdraw fees for Bitcoins.** They can be withdrawn via email or the block chain for free. The additional 0.89% + 0.05BTC only applies when converting to USD via MTGox instant ask.
@_date: 2012-12-23 18:52:26
How many CAPTCHAs have you tried where the text was so distorted not even a human could read it? I've seen some so distorted that it takes 3 or 4 tries which can be a real pain. If I could pay half a cent and not have to struggle reading a text CAPTCHA then to me it is worth it.
@_date: 2012-12-23 20:30:59
No confirmations are required since it would be impractical. Double spends are therefore theoretically possible but there are still technical difficulties in doing that.
Nothing is stopping webmasters from pairing this up with existing text CAPTCHA services and requiring users to complete both. With BitcoinCAPTCHA, using a real 2 factor CAPTCHA is now possible. 
@_date: 2012-12-06 17:42:07
Our Mobile Checkout is very simple to integrate into any business too. Just enter your order number and order total. Click checkout and it will automatically generate a QR code for the customer to pay.
It can now be accessed from your WalletBit dashboard and without logging in. This means you can give the checkout link to any employee and your Bitcoins will remain secure.
@_date: 2012-10-22 03:10:24
Yes but BitPay doesnt have a service to email Bitcoins, SecureCard or ResponsePay. When the Point of Sale system and its corresponding features are complete they will be available free of charge too.
Another interesting feature WalletBit offers that you might be interested is a subscription purchase as documented here 
@_date: 2012-10-25 21:45:52
Thank you for your question. WalletBit does not offer client side encryption at this time. We do however use established and reliable security protocols to keep your Bitcoins safe. WalletBit also has a proprietary technology called Secure Card to help keep your Bitcoins safe. For more information please see our website at  and 
@_date: 2012-10-22 01:27:42
This component of WalletBit has been indefinitely suspended. We have not abandoned the program entirely but it is not something we are planing on reviving any time soon. If you have found any trace of it on the website, please report it and we will remove it.

If you are the one buying you can use WalletBit's new Mobile Checkout PoS system. You can select local currency and the amount you would like to buy. It will then automatically calculate the Bitcoin amount based on the currency selected. Alternatively you could use this to buy Bitcoins off people you know by paying cash for something they are buying in exchange for their Bitcoins.
@_date: 2012-10-25 12:51:06
There is no block chain download with WalletBit either. There is also no software to download as it runs entirely on HTML5. This means you can use it from any html5 enabled device and it cant be removed from any app store. Founded in July 2011, we are the longest running wallet service still in operation today.
@_date: 2012-10-30 21:56:33
WalletBit offers automated currency exchange through MTGox instant ask to preserve the $ value of your order. More details on how to set this up can be found here

You just pointed out the benefit for website operators with that CAPTCHA solving service. $1/1000 CAPTCHAs will not be possible, making life more difficult for spam bots. It is up to the webmaster ultimately whether to use the BitcoinCAPTCHA service or not.
BitcoinCAPTCHA is a free service offered courtesy of WalletBit. We created it out of a need we saw demonstrated by the following threads on Bitcointalk:
@_date: 2012-12-18 23:17:26
2.75% is all inclusive for each currency. Each currency has its own minimum fee per transfer, so theoretically it could cost more. Because you can set your own minimum transfer level and they are done on a weekly basis, 2.75% is easily attainable.
@_date: 2012-10-22 01:38:11
Thank you. We have changed that page to redirect to the homepage to prevent any further confusion.
@_date: 2012-10-22 02:25:57
It is free to send, withdraw and transfer Bitcoins. However, you always pay to receive or deposit funds into your WalletBit account.
@_date: 2012-10-22 03:29:16
As far as I know, you have always been able to accept Bitcoins directly at WalletBit. A WalletBit account is the default option but you can still pay directly from main blockchain.
As you can see from a test site, all you need to do is click on pay with any bitcoin client at the bottom.  You can play with our various buttons for yourself at  (FOR TEST PURPOSES ONLY). 
If you explore the features documented on our site, you can see everything we offer as both an online wallet and a payment processor.
@_date: 2012-10-30 03:23:09
Thanks for the feedback. We will update instructions accordingly.
@_date: 2012-11-07 06:31:36

This is the reason that services like WalletBit will be popular and effective for new Bitcoin users. It is important while using an ewalllet service to be able to trust the provider. WalletBit has been around longer than any other ewallet service, making us the ideal choice.
@_date: 2012-10-22 00:49:46
There are several free ways to send funds through WalletBit including email and SMS transfers. However, when someone receives those funds into their account whether from deposit, email, SMS or a sale the fee is as low as 0.89%.
@_date: 2012-10-22 02:37:49
We are sorry to hear that you feel this way. In some cases we will reward those who report a bug in appreciation for helping us to fix it. In this case, the Virtual Visa Service was a functional service for a period of time and a single remnant of it was left behind. While we make sure our website is as accurate as possible, our core services go through even more rigorous quality control standards as you can see here 
@_date: 2012-10-30 03:02:33
I hope this answers your question. You should just have to scan the bar code.
@_date: 2012-10-25 12:48:55
There is no block chain download with WalletBit. With fees as low as 0.89% and a mobile based client called ResponsePay, it is an easy way to introduce newcomers to Bitcoin wallets. Founded in July 2011, we are the oldest wallet service still in operation so you know your funds are safe.
@_date: 2012-11-19 23:16:46

WalletBit has already emailed them to start accepting it. In the meantime we have been offering, as a courtesy, the option to buy the humble bundle with bitcoin. However this is not a direct sale and we convert to paypal in order to pay Humble Bundle. 
@_date: 2012-12-23 18:48:47
Then the Bitcoin network will adjust its fees accordingly and the CAPTCHA amount can be further reduced. The nice thing about Bitcoin is that it is infinitely divisible. Webmasters could also offer the option of one or the other (Bitcoin or text).

A Swedish translation has also been added.
@_date: 2012-10-22 02:26:58
Hi nymbot,
What part exactly are you confused about. Hopefully my post above answers some of your questions. WalletBit is a payment service provider and an online wallet service. Fees are the same for merchants and personal accounts.
@_date: 2012-12-23 17:52:33
Text CAPTCHA can be thwarted by OCR so it suffers from the same vulnerability. A bot could send the bitcoins to an address but it would add up in terms of network fees rather quickly. This adds a monetary deterrent that doesn't exist with text CAPTCHA challenges.
@_date: 2012-10-30 02:30:24
ResponsePay is the mobile component of WalletBit. If you log into  from any mobile device or tablet you will get a mobile optimized version of WalletBit. Since it is HTML5 based it can't be removed from any app store and is also up to date. The new Mobile Checkout for ResponsePay is the only method I would use for face to face Bitcoin transactions going forward.
@_date: 2012-11-26 22:17:24
Thank you for your hard work. Vietnamese translation is now live.

Thanks Julian, I couldn't have put it much better myself. In addition, there may be several calculations to determine the value in your local currency that are all done automatically and recorded by our system. This prevents any errors in calculations and it is always up to date.
Once you have accepted Bitcoins PoS or OTC, you will then have the option to withdraw to any Bitcoin address or send to any email address free of charge. With our Secure Card technology WalletBit also prevents theft from key-loggers or trojan wallet thieves, which is becoming more of a problem.
@_date: 2012-12-12 00:57:48
You could use our BTC-USD auto conversion at  It costs 2.75% with minimum fee of $15 for USD. This means it has to be about $550 worth of Bitcoins to get 2.75% and the funds are transferred every Monday. Typically this feature is only for merchants but if your family member wanted to set up a WalletBit account I would be happy to make sure it gets approved for bank deposits.
@_date: 2012-11-10 01:24:56
I have never seen any such bugs with WalletBit. Balances have never mysteriously disappeared nor have transactions magically appeared. Since its html5 based, its always up to date.
@_date: 2012-12-23 18:33:07
A very small amount of Bitcoins must be sent to complete BitcoinCAPTCHA.  Small transactions on Bitcoin network usually require a fee to send. Text captcha bypassing services are already available for $1 per 1000 CAPTCHAs. The transaction fees alone would generate far more than $1 for miners so it is a greater deterrent than already exists today.
@_date: 2012-11-02 03:51:03
WalletBit and ResponsePay are on the screens and the video illustrates how they are interchangeable. WalletBit is your desktop/laptop Bitcoin solution. ResponsePay is its counterpart for tablets and mobile devices. 
Both accounts are linked together so that WalletBit is your at home service and ResponsePay you take with you. If you would not like to use ResponsePay however it can be disabled.

There is strong competition and it is WalletBit. We are more affordable Bitcoin payment processor anywhere in the world except USA (for now). These are a few isolated cases of upset customers that any business will have. The vast majority of WalletBit users are extremely satisfied with the support and service they are receiving. WalletBit listens to suggestions from everyone and have received many from the Avalon pre-order experience. We are working hard to implement those suggestions and improve our service with the feedback we get.  It is from our mistakes that we learn to become a stronger, better and more user friendly company in the future.
@_date: 2013-03-23 01:30:34
The best way to get more merchants to accept Bitcoin is to ask them. Many people are very interested in getting their hands on bitcoins and the easiest way is to do it is to accept them as a form of payment.
BIPS is 100% free if you stay in Bitcoins. We give you free merchant tools and a free secure eWallet. BIPS offers the most affordable guaranteed Bitcoin rate globally at 2.5% (42 supported currencies).
@_date: 2013-03-08 22:25:22
It is 0.89% to store and 0.89% to retrieve. This requires physical action on our part.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:22:08
BIPS is still profitable with this business model. Enough so that we have even more in store for customers down the road.

BIPS recently launched a 0% merchant processing solution to make Bitcoin an easy sell for all merchants. If you are looking for an alternative merchant processor it's an easy choice. BIPS is created by the same team that brought you WalletBit which means we have been creating Bitcoin solutions since June 2011.
@_date: 2013-02-19 00:51:52
Yes WalletBit has a 0.89% deposit fee for our eWallet. The TL:DR version of your post is something we have been trying to communicate for some time. We have advertised this for many months since it used to be 1.49% but some people still weren't aware despite us operating since July 2011. That created the unfortunate situation where some users were depositing, unaware of the fees. 
The last thing WalletBit wants to do is collect fees from unsuspecting customers. We want both our and your customers to leave satisfied with their payment experience. We have listened to your suggestions and made our deposit fee more visible on our deposit page. This is a basic step we agreed needed to be taken and will not be necessary when we release our ultimate solution. We are excited to announce that we are working on something that will prevent this confusion from happening all together in the future. 
The day of the orders we had to decide between processing refunds or processing orders. As soon as any refund would have been given it would have caused further delays for those who ordered successfully by flooding our support desk with requests. We came to the conclusion that confirming orders was more important since all transactions through WalletBit are already to be considered final. This caused some unintended collateral damage and we apologize to all those affected.
This decision became final when forrestv tried to extort WalletBit. Any attempts to threaten or extort WalletBit will be met with stiff resistance, refusal of service and potential legal action. In retrospect we probably shouldn't have made the refund refusal an organization wide policy and once again we are sorry. Thank you everyone for all of your suggestions and we will consider every one of them.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:18:16

We are the most affordable Bitcoin option with the same flat rate on all of our 42 currencies. I know sometimes MasterCard charges more for micro-transactions but with Bitcoin that is a non-issue. Even if we are an extra 0.5% the added business from accepting Bitcoins will be more than worth it. Alternatively you can keep your Bitcoins for free and decide to sell them at a later date for a higher price (negative fees?).
@_date: 2013-03-23 23:27:51
Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and a symbolic gesture of a simple background change that shouldn't impede yours in any way.

BIPS' spread depends on the volatility of the market. Because it has been a volatile day, you see a higher spread. 
Of course you can use our services without buying or selling anything and not pay a bitcent to us. This includes all of our security features such as 3 factor auth (SHA-512 Hashed Passwords, Secure Card, Google Auth) and IP Guard.
BIPS is not just a merchant processing website but it is also a free ewallet. It supports in browser QR scanning (FF/Opera on Android) and has many innovative features. Transfers from one BIPS account to another BIPS account are instantly confirmed. You can see screenshots of the website on a mobile device here:
