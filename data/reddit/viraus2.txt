Everyone knew that bitcoin was *in* a bubble. (of course, the specific numbers are impossible to predict)
People only "buried their heads in the sand" towards the attitude that bitcoin is nothing *but* a bubble. That is, something that will pop and then just go away forever. That ain't gonna happen.

I honestly wonder. I was looking at that too during and after the first big "crash" down to 11K or so, but so far it seems like the shape of that recent bubble stage has been a bit different than previous iterations. Call me a bullish sucker but I honestly wonder if we'll ever get below 10K anymore.
I wouldn't exactly be *surprised* if it did though. Bitcoin being what it is.

A market like crypto, which is unregulated and has very little barrier of access and withdrawal, is very easy to manipulate by throwing a lot of money around. The suspicion is that certain folks are coordinating price movements by placing huge buys and sells to inspire hope or fear in the market.

It's almost certainly a mix of both.
I think a good rule of thumb is that if they bought it at &lt;4-5K, they're probably confident it will go up. If they bought it at &gt;15K, they're probably convincing themselves. Just a rough way to separate folks who bought based on appreciation for the tech (or people who have already held through a crash) versus people who heard about crazy bitcoin gains and FOMO'd in

You're right that this is ultimately arbitrary, but if you're holding something that can vary so much in value, it kind of has to be. Otherwise you have to admit that any drop in price means "losing the profits you made" and any gain means "losing potential profits from buying the dip". Everyone trading bitcoin has, in this sense, lost an infinite amount of money.
Ultimately you just have to make judgement calls based on what makes sense to your own risk management preferences. And hedging against total loss by recouping your initial investment is psychologically helpful for long-term holding of the rest of your assets.
@_date: 2019-07-15 07:49:05

It's more disingenuous to imply that Venezuela and Sweden have a system in common and are only different due to leadership
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:45:27
True, although DMT is different from the others. LSD and Shrooms are day-long experiences that interface with your surroundings and actions. DMT is a 20-minute long psychedelic fuckup that's all in your head. It can be very restorative, eye-opening, and meditative. However, I think that on DMT you're less likely to have revelations about your personal life, because it's so rapid and internal and abstract. You might have revelations about yourself though.
@_date: 2019-07-02 01:37:47
However you define it though, the effective "socialist" countries that get brought up are much more similar to the USA than Venezuela or the USSR.
Lots of posters in this thread implying that Venezuela could be just as effective as other "socialist" countries like Sweden if it weren't for nasty corrupt Maduro. Although the corruption is hardly helping matters, OP's point is that the country's system is doomed by design, and Canada is not a counterexample

Lol, it was an all time high not too long ago at 3000. There are many points in BTC's history where buying at ATH would give you massive gains to follow. Same with any asset that rises in value.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:39:03
People really didn't think of 1100 as a peak. The attitude was "1000 is the new floor, any coin under 1000 is an absolute steal, and we have nowhere to go but up".
And then everything crashed, and made a bunch of memes about holding through the dip....all the way down
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:02:07

At the risk of sounding like a bear-troll, this is a pretty small jag upward. Every crash has little bumps like this, or at least most of them do. If you're really worried about it, selling now might still be smart, especially if you'd be taking profit. 
If you're down to hold on for a year or so, though...I say keep holding

You'll see instructions for cash withdrawals and deposits on the exchange that you're using. Make sure that your exchange has a good reputation for easy transfers in your country. They should also provide a bitcoin address to send BTC to. So you'd just send BTC there like you'd send it anywhere else.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:38:34


Sentiment around here is very bullish, but I wouldn't discount the possibility of sub 10k levels. I remember back in 2013, *everyone* here was acting like 1k was the permanent floor, and that you'd have to be a troll to suggest any major dip below that. And then, of course, it fell to 200-300 USD and stayed there for years.
I can't tell you when the best time to buy in is, nobody can. I'd just say that if you want to buy it, do what seems right to you, and stick to that decision. Bitcoin is very volatile, so don't just panic sell for a loss if it dips after you buy in.

Coinbase is a solid bet, especially for smaller amounts. It's pretty easy to connect your coinbase account to a bank, and at that point cashing out is as easy as putting in the sell and then making the dollar transfer- or just keep dollars in coinbase if you want to buy in a dip. I like Gemini a little better.

If I were a more daytrady person, I'd say it's reasonable to sell off small portions of your holdings at price highs and be quick to jump back on the train after a dump. But that's too damn stressful, I HODL my bitcoins like they're an emotional support animal

Such is bitcoin. Good for OP to get used to that feeling early
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:12:44
Pretty much everyone in the early days with that much coin sold most of it for well under $50 anyway. Hindsight bias is real, and bitcoin was a much scarier investment back then.
There's a reason so many current bitcoin millionaires are people who created wallets and forgot about them for a while.

Did subredditdrama link to this sub recently or what?
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:16:22
my totally newbish impression:
Some traders will "short" an asset if they think it's going to decline and they want to profit off that. The mechanism is a  theoretical "selling" of a certain asset at that point in time, with an obligation to buy it later. If the price is lower when you buy it back, profit!
But if you're not careful you can get in a crazy situation if the price just goes up. So, people set a price with their trading platform that automatically buys back the asset, so that people can take their loss and move on rather than get REALLY hosed.
So when you have a big price jump like this, it often triggers a lot of these auto-buys. And what happens when you have a shitload of people buying an asset at once time? The price goes up even more, really fast. This is the "short squeeze".
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:07:26

You can't be an effective trader if you cry and freak out over every loss in "unrealized gains".
The truth is you lose "unrealized gains" every time any thing you own goes down, but if you sell the moment that an asset goes down a bit, you won't get anywhere investing. Hell, you lose "unrealized gains" everytime a stock goes up that you didn't buy. "Unrealized gains" is theoretically infinite, which is why it's stupid to worry about in real life.

I think the sentiment/joke is funny but this is terrible format for it.
@_date: 2018-06-26 02:12:59
It's a basic part of learning how to invest. If you sell every time the price of an asset goes down you will lose money. If you freak out about your assets while they're down you're making yourself needlessly miserable and opening yourself up to emotional impulse decisions. It's smart to analyze your risk tolerances and set a bail-out price for some assets, especially ones that you're less sure about, but fretting over "unrealized gains" is still foolish.
@_date: 2018-06-25 22:17:03
Some people think that bailing out on your investments the moment they go down is financial genius. In real life these people would have missed any serious crypto gains unless they just happened to buy directly before a bull run. The rest of us have probably had to hold the bag a few times before seeing real action.

Exactly it. Moms love this show. In addition to the competent, standard sitcom scenarios, it includes a lot of vocabulary that reminds them of stuff their kids talk about that they don't quite understand. If they talk about raiding molten core in WoW, or whatever, it gets a "I recognize that!" laugh because their kids have conversations a bit like that.
So yeah, all the redditors acting like they're real patricians by complaining about this show look ridiculous since it was never really geared for them anyway. The show's very good at what it does....which is appeal to moms.

Honestly, there is no norm- price for the past year or so had been steady until March Madness kicked it. 
However, this would be at least the third time that we've seen a big dumpoff events after a high price point- People see that high, think "Buy Low Sell High", and the release of bitcoins causes the price to drop. 
No one can be sure, but given that there is no bad news associated with this drop, I call it another temporary slump that will give way to greater rises.

I'm very strongly considering accepting bitcoin myself. As far as I can tell, an online store could just route customers through the purchase order/deferred payment options and email customers the address on request. *Really* damn simple for a business that handles very large orders rather than many small ones. The biggest obstacle, I feel, is how difficult it still is for Joe Customer to get the bitcoins in the first place.

I think the extent of my future-seeing powers is "It'll go down a bit after this spike, then rise up again to low 100s or higher". Even that's basically just going off of past behavior, anything further than that would be a guess.
I'm guessing above 115 in two weeks, above 300 in half a year. I'm an optimist assuming that access to bitcoin gets easier, some clever startups come up, and bitcoin gets more online shopping cart support. I'm also assuming no serious gov't crackdown. These might all be wrong.

You're coming in during the aftermath of a pretty hefty bubble pop, so it's volatile as all hell. Go ahead and buy a bit, it's fun to be involved and you'll probably learn a lot about markets. I also personally think it will be above 100 in the fairly near future, though plenty disagree. Don't go into this with a money-making mindset, though, due to the aforementioned volatility. Put in what you can lose, and maybe try buying some stuff just to feel how smooth bitcoin is!

If you're looking to make a USD gaining investment, buy-in time is a very important and difficult decision. Since you're unfamiliar with trading coins, and possibly trading in general, I'd advise spending some beer money (money you can afford to lose) and going in with no grand expectations. Try buying stuff too, I didn't understand the joy of bitcoin until I realized how easy it can be to use and transfer. Also, don't ever beat yourself up over profits you didn't make. You're not omniscient and this is a hard market to predict.
I'll point out that the price of coins on bitfloor has risen 20+ dollars today. This could suggest a lot of things in the near future, but it seems to be like it's rising awful fast to sustain itself right now. Or maybe it's rising out of it's pit for good. Investing- shit aint easy, son!

Check the sidebar bro! Wiki in general is your friend. That'll get the concept ironed out.
Also, to borrow a 4chanism, lurk moar. Stick around on and you'll hear people talk about buying and trading bitcoins so much that you'll get completely sick of it. Basic answer for buying and trading is to hook yourself up with a trading platform site like MtGox or bitfloor.
@_date: 2013-03-27 03:38:53
Hah, I tried this today. Sold 10 at 77.5 because I thought it looked like a peak, became horribly panicked when it just wasn't going down and sold at 78.3 :(
Good news is my panic was pretty fortunate, it hasn't really gone down and may not get back for an uncomfortably long time. the 15 bucks lost (at present BTC value) wasn't too much loss for the little lesson in me going in over my head.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:21:09

Any amount is good, really. It just depends on how much capital you have and how much you're willing to convert. I've purchased 10 at 44 and another 10 at 55 and I consider myself fairly involved, given that I'm a fairly average lower-upper-middle-class 20something, but others would of course call that chump change.

I like this post. 
Although I haven't sinned as much as other buyers- I put in money I could lose and researched/appreciated the true value of bitcoin before any purchase - I've still "lost" according to current exchange rate, having purchased at an average of 77 USD/BTC and not sold. I'm goddamn sick of being called a greedy poseur just because I didn't sell at 260, and being called a sucker and an idiot for believing in a technology on it's own damn subreddit.
 
Thanks for reminding me of the good.

This particular rise doesn't argue for or against this being a bubble or not. If it's a bubble, it's acting like one. If the bitcoin is undervalued, the price is shooting up to meet it.

The short answer is that the 900 price level was such a rare and disparate outlier that it doesn't show up in the trendlines, which do some averaging. It's hard to regret not selling at 900, just because there were so few of those sales that actually went through.

$445 for 10 (after fees). God help me if we're on top of the B-Word, I know. But it was just lying there in a savings account doing nothing but depreciating, so I'm okay risking a loss or going for the long haul. The ease and low cost of transaction clinched the deal.

My thoughts of a little metallic diversification went from piqued to interested. I'd love to buy in via Amani, but before I put any BTC in there I need to know that I can sell them off in a reasonably cheap/fast/dependable way.

If you live in a more-or-less urban area, try  if you want to purchase decent amounts for investing. For the past two weeks or so it's been tough to get USD uploaded onto Bitcoin exchange sites, but if you can convert your Benjis to Bits in person, those bitcoins will be quite easy to move onto Mt Gox or elsewhere. Although it's advertised quickness is tempting, Coinbase has had some serious trouble keeping up with demand, I would not recommend it for now.

Well this was certainly a step into the lion's den, Fred.
Assuming it all works relatively smoothly, though, that's a really smart move! I'm looking forward to buying in without Mt Gox's fuckery during the next trough.

Can't hurt to get the word out!
It's not really REI's call, though- companies generally get their online shopping systems from third party sources, like ASP Storefront. I do know that Foxycart has the option, but they're a bit on the small side.
However, having companies call up their providers with requests for bitcoin will certainly help.
