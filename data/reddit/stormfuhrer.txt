How is bitcoin fictional?
I can only assume you you don't fully understand what fictional means.
Bitcoin is backed by the same thing gold is backed by,  the ammount of time/cost it took to mine it, plus the time/cost for everyone that was mining and *didn't* find it.
"it's only value is based on what people are willing to pay for it"

They actually aren't that different other than bcash has larger blocks, a shortsighted solution to kick the can of transaction scaling down the road, and a difficulty adjustment that's rigged to game the hashrate swing between chains. 
It's basically a vehicle for undesirables to ride on bitcoins coattails, hence the way they freak out when it gets called bcash. 
The whole 2x thing was just to try destabilise btc in favour of bcash.
Everyone will have their own take on it, like I said, it's not right for me to make you understand the situation. It's a game of incomplete information, full of verifiably very shady characters.
There really is no substitute for personal research.

They mean they want to hold out until they finished holding out on letting their customers dump bcash.
For them it's all about harming BTC and supporting bcash/eth.
I guess they figure that if their customers dumb bcash even after they attempt to prop up the price and Rogers pump and dump/campaign of lies, it's game over anyway so they might as well enable segwit.

@_date: 2017-12-02 17:53:10
Coinbase literally wants to become the Fed of crypto. They were part of the 2x cabal for exactly that reason.
Now they will throw their weight behind bcash, if they think they can pull off on ramping all the noobs that mass adoption is going to bring in 2018, their partnership with chineseminercoin might just win, or so they think.
IMO fees aren't going to push anyone into buying alts, the only people messing with alts are speculators and noobs that missed the BTC boat and hope to get rich quick with "the next bitcoin".
BCH is the scammers last chance to try and control bitcoin.  With the CME and NASDAQ about to proclaim BTC is bitcoin for all the world to see, you can expect to see some very desperate shit from the BCH camp in the not too distant future.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:18:14
If coinbase had allowed people to dump it, it would have effectively died months ago. Let's not pretend coinbase isn't the motherload.
As for these "fervent groups", there is no volume, r/btc are literally the only ones using it, which is why they keep tipping backwards and forth all the time, to create the illusion of some kind of volume.
Coinbase is supporting the price, and it's precisely their goal.
Hold off enabling people to dump long enough for Ver and Jihan to continue the ridiculous price pumping/washing charrade on a single no fee Korean exchange.
They're hoping that by Jan enough people will begin to think it's actually a true value, and thus not dump it.
Perfectly explains their "strange" behaviour not supporting segwit.
Let's not forget their deliberate vagueness when pressed on which coin they would consider to be "bitcoin" during their 2x fiasco. Which would have crashed the whole network if they'd had their way.
They are either bad actors, or woefully incompetent, either way they are nothing but cancer to bitcoin now.
Despicable behaviour.

Yes, it's totally possible to set it up with your seed, accessed by the main pin.
Then you can also set a passphrase (creating a second account/seed), which you can attach to a second pin (to prevent you having to type the passphrase every time you access the account.
So essentially you can access two accounts using their separate pin.
You can have as many passphrase accounts as you like. However, only one can be bound to a pin.
To add extra passphrase accounts select temp passphrase in the security menu.
Temp just means you have to type the whole passphrase in every time you want to access that account.

Just spend it and withdraw the coin.  You didn't know it was charged back.
I guy I trust completely told me a personal friend of his managed to withdraw around 50k worth of ETH they had mistakenly credited to his account a few months back. He even verified to make the large withdrawal. 
He never heard anything more about it.

The longest *BTC* chain is the real chain. BCH is an altcoin. According to your logic, Dogecoin would be the real Bitcoin if it had the longest chain.

You're either a shill or literally have zero knowledge of what you're talking about.
Either way, just shut the fuck up.

Even isn't stupid enough to swap all his BTC for BCASH.
He is however, without doubt, a big enough conman to pretend he has.
Just like his bum chum CSW likes to pretend he's Satoshi.
I pity the noobs getting scammed by these reprobates.

She's your wife man WTF.
Tell her about that shit, you're meant to be partners.
Shes legally entitled to 50% of it anyway (in most countries) and if you got caught concealing assets like that during a divorce...  You'd have a bad time.

When someone says "my wife" 99.9% of the time they aren't talking about some common law bs that isn't even recognised in the vast majority of states.
Hiding a near multimillion $ fortune from your wife is not honest, and certainly isn't respectful.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:06:01
Bitcoin is changed by consensus, BCH didn't even try to get consensus so it created a new coin. Thus it isn't bitcoin and never will be.

Well if you look at my post history you'll see my last post in btc wasn't long ago.
Within the last 3days.
No idea of date/time as I never received a message / notification of ban...

Personally, I'd have told her at or before proposition (Assuming it was a legit fortune at that point). Otherwise, you're not really being honest about what you're getting her into.


Sure, of course he can... It's hardly judging him though, the guy literally went on fucking reddit and asked for peoples opinions.

Coinbase are a piece of shit company with a piece of shit CEO. 
They shameless supported 2x, the same way they are shameless propping up the price of bcash by refusing to let their customers access it till Jan. 
Coinbase are enemies of the real bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:20:32
Of course it's an altcoin. The fact it's called BCH and not BTC should be a dead giveaway...
I guess you think BTG isn't an altcoin either.
There's a reason why these scammers choose to fork BTC rather than try and make a new coin or fork ABC shitcoin that's worth 0.00000022, ...because they're creating nothing new, and the whole thing is an exercise in stealing value from BTC.
Turns out there's more Armani fakes on ebay than fakes of Lidl's clothing range.
Shocking eh.

You can't refute the facts so you attack the man.

Fireworks are explosives, he was convicted of offences relating to agricultural explosives.
There are strict laws regarding the storage and shipping of explosives, and for good reason.
If you think its "definitely meaningless" that he put peoples lives at risk for personal gain you're a fucking cretin.

All the volume coming from one exchange in Korea.
Ver &amp; Co HAD to pump the price, or no one would mine it.
2x was only ever intended to weaken BTC in favour of BCH.
This is why Coinbase (part of the attack group) won't let people dump their BCH till Jan.
They're simply propping up the price. 
If they hadn't done so it'd be dead already, you know it, I know it, everyone knows it.
Show me the transactions on BCH.
It's all smoke and mirrors and they don't have the money to pump it indefinitely.
Spoiler: People buying Bcash over Bitcoin are gonna get rekt. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:53:42
Yes, BCH was created because they knew 2x was probably never gonna fly.
They merely used the whole 2x fiasco to try and weaken BTC in favour of Chineseminercoin.

Could you explain this?
On r/btc the "reply" under each post does nothing (works fine on every other sub)
and theres this...
 If I go to r/btc on a mobile device I get a message saying "You are banned from commenting in this community for now"
I have no inbox/notification of a ban or duration there of... nothing.
Also, as far as I can see there is no mention in the supposed public moderation logs...
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:23:23
No. I usually tag him just to make sure he won't miss my posts.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:10:58
Of course, they're witholding it to prop up the price of BCH. It'd be dead already if people were able to dump it.
Coinbase are verified bad actors and enemies of BTC.

Everyone absolutely must stop using shapeshift immediately.
They have proved beyond all reasonable doubt they are supporting bcash and are therefore enemies of bitcoin.
Their attempted deception in deleting tweets etc and saying it was a mistake should be taken as further insult to your intelligence.
Shapeshift: Not even once.

If they fork it, it's not bitcoin. 
Again, you fail to understand the most basic aspects of bitcoin.

This. Not long ago they were testing the water by referring to bitcoin as bitcoin core.

Right, he should have got it right and said he's a convicted felon who served time for endangering the lives of his neighbours and postal workers for personal financial gain. Also that his company was involved in selling counterfeit Cisco equipment. 
It's perfectly reasonable,  even sensible, to take into account someone's verifiably shady as fuck past actions and displays of poor character,  when attempting to discern if they're currently being a scammer.

Ah the resident concern troll, always arguing the side of any anti btc actor.
@_date: 2018-04-03 12:06:24
How this blatant concern troll wasn't banned long ago is beyond me.
Literally all he does is try and quell any pro btc sentiment,  and defend those that act against the interests of btc.
