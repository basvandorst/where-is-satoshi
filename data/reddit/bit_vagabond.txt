The purpose of arresting you and detaining you before trial is to allow the state a reasonable window to gather evidence without you trying to destroy it

I don't figure anything, that is why people are arrested: to allow the prosecution the freedom to build a case against you without you interfering or fleeing the country.

Another proprietary system missing the whole point of a decentralized monetary system.

Bcash and bitcoin[dot]com has stung so many newbies and spread so much confusion that I'm starting to think it has singlehandedly kept bitcoin (of any flavor) from being adopted by the masses aready.

Alibaba shouldn't be allowed to file any global patents.  If China ignores the rest of the world's IP rights, why should we respect theirs?

Alas, even at the literally atomic level, two opposing things can be true, which is a core concept of quantum physics.  But my own pedantics aside: I do very much agree with you that we need to focus as much as we can on "issue" level sociopolitical debates (more granularity) over "side" level (us vs them).  The polarization of today's political climate is nearing critical mass (pun sadly intended).

The best debates always have validity in opposing viewpoints.  Hence why the left and right are irreconcilable.  They both hold strong negatives and strong positives.  We humans have a hard time with paradoxes but two opposing things can be correct.  It's also ok to pick sides... we're humans afterall.

People that don't understand that you can buy less than 1 bitcoin don't have any business buying bitcoin.

Would have preferred they stabilized it at 19k instead of 6.

No you don't need to speak to your wife first.  You're your own man right?

My personal half baked theories:
(1) The bull run of last year was mainly (if not entirely) due to the news of two upcoming forks.  People saw an easy way to almost double their money guaranteed.  No more forks this year.
(2) The side-betting nature of Futures allowed whales to dump their coins, move the market, and make a killing off of people who bet long.
(3) People didn't know about bitcoin before.  Now everyone does and most n00bs got stung by the price drop, therefore will never touch bitcoin again.
(4) $6,400 is the equilibrium point where normies can buy a whole bitcoin, and don't understand you can buy less than 1.
(5) Arbitrage bots have eaten up all swings between crypto coins, and they're all pretty much pegged together now, meaning in order to move the bitcoin price you have to move the entire cryptosphere.
