I see. Then my best guess in this case is that mtgox didn't include this particular transaction in their batch feed to the pools.

That's right. The transactions I mentioned in my OP, first showed up in the [feed]( then disappeared from the feed, but where in fact confirmed on the block chain. As I didn't upload that particular feed to pastebin, there is no way for me to prove these particular transactions in hind sight. So what I did, is I posted a new feed to pastebin ~~and I'm waiting for one of them to confirm and disappear from the tx feed.~~ **Edit: there is now proof, see OP**
Here is another similar post which hints at proof, but it's not water proof imho:  , but at least it's an independent source reporting similar activity. (go to  as mentioned in the post and set resolution to "7d").

Well, there is no proof for that :-) Just [mtgx outspoken intention]( (to be taken with a grain of salt as we're used to) and the signals that 1) they are making good progress with the final step of their maintenance (the withdrawal queue, which is showing new transactions, and now, some of which are confirming) 2) users are reporting successful significant fiat withdrawals.
**Edit:  Apparently jungle's question has been rephrased, so it now looks like I am saying I don't have any proof of the transactions. The proof that the transactions originated on mtgox are in the pastebins mentioned in OP. If you don't believe the pastebins, try watching the tx feed yourself. Or, for your convienience, see this tx feed history:  and extract some ntxids that have been removed from the feed and enter those in blockchain.info**
@_date: 2014-03-01 06:46:38
This can't be done. You need the private key to spend the coins. Not even miners can spend it without the private key. Creating "new" coins out of thin air (meaning other than the block rewards) can't be done either, at least not without changing the Bitcoin protocol. I don't think the devs nor community will go along with that, so then your only option is to hard fork the bitcoin source code to a version where mtgox' bitcoins are in a wallet under your control, due to this being hard-coded in your version of the source code. Then you would have to convince everybody to ditch the current Bitcoin in favor of your hard-fork of Bitcoin, so that everybody actually agrees with that you now own mtgox' former coins (if the majority doesn't follow your protocol, the coins will still belong to mtgox practically). Do you think you've got what it takes to pull that off? :-)

If you click the blockchain.info links in the OP, you can see these transactions are actually confirmed. The transactions from yesterday did not confirm when I checked, later I heard that was because some inputs contained coins that were less than 100 confirmations old (meaning they can't be spent yet).
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:04:10
Hi nullc. What do you reckon are the odds they are doing this on purpose to test their new withdrawal system? Wouldn't it make sense to test the edge cases?

The top transaction on that page (hash d0e8040c69a41d9a63b9a1fabe54f42ddde6c93da9544c69023448aa4fbd3671) is in the mtgox tx feed, so yes, that address is under the control of mtgox. This doesn't necessarily have to be one of their main wallets, it could just be an user's bitcoin deposit address.
@_date: 2014-02-22 14:05:50
If you go to the address where this transaction originated from, you can see the balance is 0 BTC, that is why it won't confirm. 
Other reasons I can think of for other transactions, may be:
* Insufficient balance
* Double spends (e.g. due to malleability)
* No TX fee and for some reason mtgox decided not to include this TX in the batch they send off to the mining pools (i.e. just testing), mtgox would have to set up some private feed with the pools to have them included regardless.
@_date: 2014-02-22 14:06:36

Wait, so this post is about mtgox, too? :P
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:59:31
I see, that is a good point right there. Thanks for bringing that up. Does that mean mtgox rebroadcasts them after a day or so? And that also means an attacker could attempt a malleability attack if they know when to broadcast it ahead of mtgox' second attempt? (an attack which should become impossible after the "ntxid" update?)

You can compare outgoing vs stuck tx here:  . You might want to set the resolution to "7d" to see today's activity in more detail.
Can't find a sure reason why this one did not go through in particular, but if I'd had to guess it's because of the lack of transaction fee, and mtgox decided not to pass this (test?) transaction to the miners.
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:13:43
I see. If it's a cronjob that they didn't turn off, wouldn't that mean that we're seeing improvements here? If the manual tests are generating valid transactions, but the old software (aka cronjob) is still doing the wrong things automatically as it's not updated yet, that's still progress, right?
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:09:47
Confirmed, same here.
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:41:11
Hope this helps, here is a (recent) history of the mtgox transaction feed:  . All the inputs you find there in the repository history are managed by mtgox (the latest transaction was even 11 hours ago strange enough, so some software must still be running somewhere). Another couple of earlier history dumps you may find [here]( [here]( and [here]( Good luck! Please keep us posted on progress :-)
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:15:02
The ones that are coming through right now are just a few hours old, as they were not in the [first pastebin]( but were in [the second]( containing some new transactions.
@_date: 2014-02-22 13:27:53
That seems the only reasonable explanation, I've heard that one before. Somebody suggested they worked together with a pool to have those fresh coins sent there to test their system.
@_date: 2014-02-22 13:53:21
To clarify, I tested if this tool indeed only returns mtgox transactions. For example, take [this transaction]( (which did not originate on mtgox) and [feed that to the tool]( then the response is:
~~&gt; {"result":"error","error":"Transaction not found","token":"unknown_error"}~~
**Edit: belay that, the transaction is now included on the output. This API url seems to be responding to all valid TX hashes, though with a slight delay.**

Hmm it does show clean now. When I tried to scan it, it offered me to view the last analysis from Jan 16th. That one had 1 warning and 1 suspicion. It seems it's not possible to see the scan history except for the last one (which has now been overwritten by a new one), should have taken a screenshot. Looks good now, but was just worried because it wasn't always like that.

That's an interesting theory. Could anyone test this by withdrawing to an internal address and then check tx feed and the block chain for it?
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:24:40
Those old test transactions may not confirm at all (hence why they needed more time to perfect their software). The ones getting confirmed now are more recent, as in created in the last few hours.

How serious is this bug about trying to spend freshly minted coins? Wouldn't it confirm after 100 blocks eventually? I've seen previous transactions from them, exactly like this and it ended up confirmed. In the worst case, that means you just have to wait a little longer for your withdrawal. This is not related to malleability as far as I can tell, and this bug, though annoying, is not a hindrance to their operations.


The transactions seem valid to me, just delayed.

Well, for what it's worth, the delay still cost me a couple of BTC because I couldn't buy at the time it was around $60 per BTC. It was around $90 per BTC when you finally returned it. So consider me an unhappy customer with no intention to use your services again.
@_date: 2013-05-27 03:43:19
I'm glad it went alright for you. Last time I used them, they held my funds for no reason until the BTC rate went up 50%, it cost me 3 BTC because of that. They refunded me $50 as gesture of good faith, but that was hardly enough to cover my losses, $50 was worth just around 0.5 BTC at the time.
@_date: 2013-04-17 12:04:29
Yes, I am assuming the same thing, too. I am suspecting they don't have enough cash flow (or funds for that matter) to pay out everybody, caused by the explosive growth in the last few days. It's a dangerous situation which indicates they don't have enough funds to keep operating like this without additional investment. My theory is this: basically they stall new funds to pay out transactions that have been waiting longer, that would explain why people have to wait for weeks to get their money, as I've been reading all over the internet. Avoiding answering support calls and interacting as little as possible with complaining customers is a symptom of this, as I can tell you from close experience with other companies in this kind of situation. I feel this company has a money problem, and when filling one hole they have to create another hole somewhere else. According to this survey, about 33% of all transactions are failing at bitinstant:

As far as I can tell, bigger orders start to fail everytime at BitInstant when there is a significant price drop on the exchanges. Small orders seem to go well most of the time. That's suspicious to me. What if they are purposely failing orders, then hoard cheap coins with other people's money, and perform damage control after the price has gone back up? Instant profit. I got set back 3 BTC due to these guys last time there was a price drop. I am seeing it happen all over again to other people now.
