Free bitcoin to spend through their services. Why do people complain about free stuff? wtf is wrong with people. Even if it is "misrepresented" (which it isn't) its still a free $35 to spend on amazon. Show some respect. For each person they retain from this promotion the more bitcoin will grow. sheesh. ffs

The miners not confirming a few transactions vs a hard fork to reverse already confirmed transactions IMO is different. I think it's a good idea. I think the miners should not only set lower bound filters for spam and dust transactions but it makes sense to set abnormally high bounds to make malicious attacks harder to pull off. IMO

If you weren't being so literal I think you would realize I was meaning the context of "is it safe to say that there is consensus among the developers that a HF should at some point happen?"
Given the context of the article it appears a lot of developers have spent considerable time (even yourself) in coming up with safe ways to execute a HF should we need to do it. But you are right I don't think there really would be an easy way if even possible to reach out to the community to determine if there is consensus amongst the community. If a hard fork happens it is mostly going to be decided by the miners, developers, and bitcoin related companies adding their opinions. I would think.

I agree, perhaps citizens don't mind trusting a dozen chinese miners, but to get industry leaders and governments using the bitcoin blockchain I think it's a no go. We need sidechains for them. Or they will all continue to create private blockchains.

Why can't side chains just pay miners to secure their side chain? This would create a huge mining industry.

I sold at $550 or so I thought, said I did and that I would receive the USD in my USD wallet. 20 minutes later I decided to try and transfer the sold BTC to the GDAX and I was able to transfer it... WTF So I sold on GDAX right before it wen't down for about $50/btc less than what I originally sold at. Coinbase has some real shitty servers, trading engines. Soon as this fiasco is over I am out. Tried to buy at $465 and I got some weird ass CB_ACCESS_KEY error.

So are you saying the debate has always been about if the block size should be increased when a hard fork takes place? Because some would argue the debate was hard fork vs soft fork in the respect that a hard fork should never be done. Do you think the mining process of bitcoin will ever become more decentralized or rather less centralized from this day forward? And thanks.

So is it safe to say consensus has formed that a HF will happen? Now devs are focused on forming consensus on how? And next when it will be? It appears there has been some serious time and thought spent on the idea of a HF. Probably because it has proven necessary for multiple other reasons than simply increasing tx/s?
@_date: 2016-08-31 20:26:37
This. As long as Bitcoin is useful as a currency people will be willing to buy/sell for cash. It will make it harder to go full circle though because as of right now the fees you pay and premiums you pay aren't worth the benefits

Fair enough. Although 6 months ago I had the impression that any time or brain power spent on the idea was a waste of time or resources, don't get that impression anymore.

I haven't discussed bitcoin with my bedroom door closed, that is kind of the point. There shouldn't be a need to. Anytime the door is closed it is because they don't want someone to know something (at least at that moment). Like I said it could be for better or worse but that is most certainly an unsettling feelings because for someone who holds a fairly significant amount (at least for me I do) I like transparency. 
The drop in price is also coincidental for such a meeting to take place. Was someone planning on writing a blog or posting what was discussed after?
How is that irrational ha? That is extremely rational haha. If it is for the better I will feel better when it is all said and done but until then being rational is to be concerned.
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:54:41
Safe to say you are speaking on behalf of all the developers that there was never any disagreement that a hard fork is necessary at some point? So are you saying that the debate was all about the block size and that if a HF is performed the blocksize won't be increased?

I see where you are coming from but I guess I just see things from a different perspective. First of all I should clarify I meant "I think it's a good idea" in perspective of performing a hard fork. I prefer neither. However I don't want to see coins being blacklisted by exchanges (which we are already starting to see) that
 IMO is the worse as it effectively destroys coins in a sense.
My cousin was robbed at gun point once, he never lost a credit card in his life, he was always responsible, but he had really no choice in this scenario. Now I am not saying what happened with bitfinex is the same but being able to call his bank and have them block his card ( I don't believe in reversable transactions, but i do believe in being able to block further transactions ) I think is a feature that is handy. I just think in certain situations it makes sense to be able to say hey Miners if you see this, this or this, happening from our addresses please stop confirming addresses that is not normal behaviour. Thanks.

Why does your session in GDAX expire after like 30 minutes? with NO WARNING. I waited patiently with my finger on the trigger to buy only to get some BS error message that made 0 sense only to find out 15 minutes later my session expired. I have never had an exchange not warn me my authentication was about to expire before it does. I know coinbase has no moral obligation to rectify a situation like this but I did lose a fair amount of money. I will take my trading to genesis or a different exchange I don't have to worry about refreshing my session every 15 minutes or risk losing the lows and highs.

Sounds like the circuit is preventing certain data from changing, once the circuit is broken the data is altered so it wouldn't matter if you reconnect it. Possibly similarly to RAM as long as it is powered what is written is there but the moment it loses power that memory is gone, re-establishing energy doesn't bring back what was being held there. 
edit: Makes me think of the saved data on a SNES video game, most people don't know this but the saved state is actually on RAM powered by a battery. The batteries just simply last a decade or more but eventually they die and your cartridges no longer will save your game.

1) There should be more certainty and guarantee of how long a transaction will take. Although there are multiple solutions that should come into effect in the next year. but for the time being it is too fickle. 
2) Too centralized. I used to think that a lot of these other big names and governments will realize they are wasting millions on their own blockchains when there is a perfectly secure open source blockchain that they could use for free to do the same thing (once the scaling issues are solved and the 2.0 layer is more robust anyways). But I realize even if it is secure and open source no one is going to want to trust a dozen chinese mining companies confirming their transactions unless they don't have direct control over the transactions, which they do.

Yeah about a week ago I got hit with some questions my self. Having used the service for nearly 2 years the same consistent way it was kind of surprising. They do seem to be "required" to ask more questions than a traditional bank which is odd and rather frustrating that they would simply comply with something more privacy intrusive than a fiat bank. whether they have a choice or not I don't know. The only thing I may have done out of the ordinary was sent a few $ worth to a friend of mine to introduce him to the concept, but i guess apparently giving away a little free money is enough to raise a red flag now.

Similarly to crfn00b I have used coinbase for years and didn't change any of my habits and a few weeks ago that asked for more information before allowing me to buy bitcoin.

Sorry to say this but your option 3 won't make a difference in most countries. Especially the USA. But we are on the same side and want the same thing.

OR you bridge the gaps little by little even if you have to succumb to the horrific financial system in order to get people exposed little by little, accepting it little by little, then transitioning into it little by little, and then converting to it completely.

This confuses me. Are you just assuming a higher fee means a fee that is unreasonable for a poor citizen? When you think of higher fee what do you think of? Like $5 or what? Cause I am paying "a higher fee" than the spammers are paying to fill the blocks and i am paying $.03 do you consider that too expensive for the poor?
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:41:00
I understand that it might be more complicated or more taboo as you put it. How ever if the block time can prevent confirmations from being delayed then this could be perma fix and thus only 1 hard fork. My city has expanded it's highways 3 times and it gets increasingly difficult to expand each time. 20mb only is going to postpone another fork unless the block size grows with halving or some sort.
But it seems to me that speeding up the block time negates the negative aspects of increasing the block size such as leading to centralization.

whats a high priority fee to you? Because I assure you if you paid above the minimum it would have received a confirmation for each of those blocks solved.. 
Or do you mean you haven't received your bitcoins at the location you sent them after all those blocks were solved? Because depending on where you are sending them they get to choose how many confirmations it takes.
If you did indeed pay a high priority fee and it didnt receive confirmations I would post the address for the transaction here so it can get looked into

Rational. Makes a hell of a lot more sense to me to gradually raise the limit. Quite honestly it irritates me to see Gavin pushing his proposal just because people can't come to a consensus. To me that's a pretty big indicator he should start looking for equal ground. compromising until there is a consensus instead of pushing his proposal forcing people to accept his proposal.

But I cant afford $.03 to get priority over the useless spam minimum fee transactions to avoid the congestion :( And having to wait 5-10 hours in back logs is unacceptable.
Guess I will use my CC and pay a higher fee and wait 1-3 business days for my money to be transferred to another location because the devs are to careful about the overall safety of Bitcoin to just quickly implement the first idea without consensus.

What was discussed is that miners can choose which transactions to include in their block it would be easy for a big miner to artificially inflate blocks to force them to grow making it more and more difficult for smaller miners to keep up with the validating etc. 
Which lead to a similar discussion, why not just speed up or slow down the avg time per block being solved and dynamically distribute the rewards? so the more tx/s the faster blocks get solved but the less bitcoin the miner is rewarded still averaging out to the 25btc/10mins or what ever

If you recognize bitcoin as a public ledger blocks would be the page the transactions are written on. the size would be how big the page of the book is, so that only a certain amount of transactions can be recorded on that page before you have to go to the next.

See my post above and check out the threads about the stress test if you haven't already. The stress test performed a few days ago made people who needed their transactions confirmed on the next block have to pay a higher fee because there was more transactions than the blocks could handle so only the highest fee paying transactions got added to the next block making some people wait more than 8 hours for their transactions to finally get in a block or they weren't confirmed ever. with 1 minute averages given the amount of transacations performed during the stress test there wouldn't have been any backed up transactions. period.
@_date: 2015-06-09 21:30:00
That is what a lot of people demanding 20MB blocks don't get. The miners get to choose which transactions are accepted on the block. I pay a VERY reasonable fee that is higher then all their stupid pointless transactions and I get accepted into the very next block! Imagine that? But wait...
They start to complain that there thousands of pointless near feeless transactions are on a back log and are unconfirmed for hours upon hours.. 
The real problem is when the fee becomes so high that its no longer reasonable to have to pay that high of a fee for a transaction that should be cheap. Which we are approaching, I am not denying that. But even with back logs we are still days faster than CC's. I don't think we should jump from 1MB to 20MB though I think gradually increasing is less risky. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 17:56:05
From what I understand the increased block size favors larger mining pools. So that is one way bigger blocks cause more centralization is that the biggest mining pools will have more and more power. So I don't think linking it to node count really impacts that. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 01:23:14
We need to have some way to see what the current minimum avg fee required to be included in the next block is as well. Chances are if you had paid $.01 more of a fee you wouldn't have had to wait.
you can thank coinwallet.eu for the delay as they are purposefully filling the blocks with the minimum fee. which forces people to pay anything higher than the minimum to get priority.

IYO is that a bad or good thing?
@_date: 2015-06-01 19:45:03
Other: Speeding the block times up seems to be just as logical as increasing the block size. 
there have been very few concerns or counter arguments towards speeding the block times up. Gavin himself is in favor of speeding the block times up to 1 minute. Perhaps the block size should be increased some but I still think we should counter the transactions per second problem by accelerating the block times versus promoting centralization by over expanding block sizes.

Not very many people are against the increase at all. In fact I would say there is a consensus for increasing the Block size. but HOW is what people aren't agreeing with. 
Some want to raise it 20x 
Some want to double it every year. 
Some want to make it grow dynamically based on the previous amount of blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:47:49
It's easier to think of it analogously. Here in my city we have a light rail that travels in a square the trains leave every 15 minutes and can fit 100 people. (blocks are solved every 10 minutes and can fit 1mb data) if 200 people are arriving at the station every 15 minutes only half can get on and eventually there will be so many people backed up that even when they stop arriving it will take several hours for them to all eventually get on the next train.
Now picture the same situation with the train leaving every 1 minute instead of 15 minutes. even with 200 people arriving every 15 minutes no one would ever have to wait. 
At least that is how I picture all of this.
We can increase transactions by making the blocks bigger or faster. Faster seems to hold the fundamental ideals behind bitcoin I believe.

Nope, the initial launch was 8, then they said they were going to send more and more. you cant just launch 4,000 satellites all at once. And Jeff Garzik's satellites weren't for relaying internet I believe they are designed specifically for bitcoin transmissions only. The satellites themselves will be connected to internet to broadcast transmissions but one could send a transaction through radio wave technology making the customer not even need internet to use bitcoin. This would be revolutionary as you no longer have to pay a month fee for internet to use the technology.

Coinbase already increased their fee to be above these pointless transactions. Most centralized wallet services will dynamically adjust their fee as needed. I have yet to be affected by ANY stress test that has been performed. If you use your own digital wallet I am sure you know wtf the fee is. If you don't you shouldn't be trying to secure your own bitcoin. 
Anyways my point being is this is a pathetic waste of time as this can be done regardless of the block size.

What this has proven though, however, is that we need to be able to determine what the avg fee would be needed to get confirmed in the next block. Some wallets don't give you the option to select your fee.

The true question is are you investing money you can afford to lose and are you in it for the long run? If the answer is yes, then yes you should buy. If the answer is no, then you might want to contemplate buying bitcoin in a way that you can sell it quickly in case things turn for the worse.

It's easier to think of it analogously. Here in my city we have a light rail that travels in a square the trains leave every 15 minutes and can fit 100 people. (blocks are solved every 10 minutes and can fit 1mb data) if 200 people are arriving at the station every 15 minutes only half can get on and eventually there will be so many people backed up that even when they stop arriving it will take several hours for them to all eventually get on the next train.
Now picture the same situation with the train leaving every 1 minute instead of 15 minutes. even with 200 people arriving every 15 minutes no one would ever have to wait. 
At least that is how I picture all of this.
We can increase transactions by making the blocks bigger or faster. Faster seems to hold the fundamental ideals behind bitcoin I believe.

You need to start learning bitcoin 101 again my friend. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 01:13:32
regardless of 1mb or 20mb what you are doing can be done by anyone at hardly any expense. So in other words what you are doing is in vain unless you try and push the transaction fee minimum to an unacceptable amount. spamming $.02 transactions just means someone has to pay $.021 to get priority over all your uselessness. Paying $.021 basically nullifies everything you are trying to accomplish... Makes it as if you don't even exist... 
despite all the stress tests I have never not once not had my transactions confirmed in the next block.
So I suggest you push your fee per transaction to like $.1 because then some companies business models might not really be profitable on the micro scale. But you will realize that you may not have enough money to affordably keep your spam tactics running very long.
You need to see the bigger picture my friend. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 16:12:15
No no no 90% are not pro 20MB. Maybe pro blocksize increase but a cannonballing 20x increase when it took 3 years to reach 1MB?. The opposition has simply requested a smaller increase to monitor possible bitcoin dooming side effects or a dynamically increasing blocksize. Most of the favor for 20mb blocks come from noise. People like I've said before couldnt pass a bitcoin 101 test for dummies if they tried to.

@_date: 2015-06-08 18:59:43
It wouldn't be any more negatively effected as it is now. If the miners can save money on electricity they will have the option to sell less to cover the costs, meaning they have to option to hold BTC if they choose to. If they still sell them all they will just be doing what they already are doing.

Perhaps a release date at least. They gave a rough release date of end of Q1 and well... Way past that. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 17:24:40
I'll try and explain with an analogy. There is a light rail in a city that has train carts (blocks on the block chain) that pass by every 15 minutes (10 minute confirmation time for blocks). Each train cart can hold 100 people (1MB transactions). People take the train to get from point A to point B (bitcoin transactions send money from person A to person B). 
If less than 100 people arrive at the train station every 15 minutes the train carts can easily carry all those people to their desired location. But the moment more than 100 people arrive before the 15 minute departure time not everyone is going to be able to get on the train cart to get to where they want, they will have to wait for the second train to pass by. If thousands of people are arriving at the train then some people might have to wait for 10 train carts (150 minutes) to arrive before they get a chance to board the train. 
As bitcoin becomes more popular and more people are sending more and more transactions per second 1MB blocks aren't big enough to fit all those transactions on the blocks that are solved an avg of every 10 minutes. Hence some people will have long wait times to get their bitcoin from point A to point B. increasing the blocks from 1MB to 20MB would be like expanding the train carts from allowing 100 people to 2000 people. Now if thousands of people arrive they wont have to wait 10 train carts.
Hope that is ELI5 enough for you  
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:41:00
I understand that it might be more complicated or more taboo as you put it. How ever if the block time can prevent confirmations from being delayed then this could be perma fix and thus only 1 hard fork. My city has expanded it's highways 3 times and it gets increasingly difficult to expand each time. 20mb only is going to postpone another fork unless the block size grows with halving or some sort.
But it seems to me that speeding up the block time negates the negative aspects of increasing the block size such as leading to centralization.

You know a lot of people think most states will copy and paste the bitlicense, and they are probably right. I think the states that really don't have a clue about Bitcoin or Digital Currencies will probably copy and paste since they won't want to go through the trouble of trying to understand what's best.
HOWEVER, I think the states that do understand it and are actively researching it will compete for the best licensing to win over businesses. I think we will see California, New Jersey, Utah all come out with their own licenses. I just hope the other states don't copy and paste New yorks until that happens.

every single suggestion increases the block size over 1MB nor has anyone said that it wouldn't be able to support something over 1MB. Where you pulling these facts from?

I can see that being true if the miners didn't have to sell their bitcoins to cover electricity costs. Unfortunately the average daily use for bitcoin as a currency isn't high enough to sustain a $1400.00 valuation because the vaste majority of bitcoin holders are simply investments.

Which is why we need to just speed the block time up to 1 minute or have it dynamically adjust based on traffic. you get the same benefits from speeding up the block time as you do increasing the block size. Obviously the reward per block would be adjusted as well.

This blog really makes the point. 
For those working on alternatives they need to present their explanations as to why their solutions would be better in both a mechanical sense and timely sense. 
Perhaps it is necessary to increase the block size at least once in order to give other more better/permanent (If they prove it) solutions more time to develop.
I don't see any one else with a solution arguing that their solution should be used. I just think that if there is going to be a hard fork we need to take care of as many foreseeable issues that could arise in the future as we can. I don't want to see another hard fork happening within a year of the first.
@_date: 2015-05-05 20:57:54
What was the address? You said you sent them to a DNM but did not purchase anything? You were sending them there for fun? For someone else (aiding)? If they were indeed only transacted once then providing the address here would allow everyone to see where the coins went after they were deposited into a DNM. My guess is the coins are long gone being spent on something. regardless if by you or someone else you're still guilty, what did you expect, don't tell me that you honestly think this is absurd. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 00:17:31
That is an excellent question. from what I personally understand is the miners can choose which transactions get priority based on their fees. If they can change these priorities value at will that further complicates things, but I would imagine the consensus would have to be based on how big the fee is to be guaranteed into the next block. 
The way I see it, during the stress test you simply had to pay more to get your transaction confirmed on the next block. When ever that "pay more" exceeds a reasonable value the difficulty would drop accelerating the block time to allow more transactions to be confirmed quicker reducing the fee needed. 
so maybe if the difficulty could be based on the current minimum needed fee to get on the next block instead of unconfirmed transactions. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:57:24
Maybe we should focus more on the sentiment where you said "I think maybe they like the higher fees" it feels like there is a lack of communication but I don't know what goes on behind the scene. I think core has tried to reduce the community noise by talking more amongst the experienced. Is that Bitcoin foundation still a thing? How many translators do they have( although the big pools speak English anyways). They should have one for each country that contributes to mining so we can all have fluent discussions. IMO. I dislike China owns as much hash power as they do but they have got to have calculated what their future looks like in all the proposed scenarios. I would imagine at least! So where are the pain points they found, and how can we better address them. If they fear segwit threatens a fee market then maybe a fork is inevitable...
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:24:00
What do you mean no consensus? Some of the miners opposing segwit asked for a 2mb HF over a year ago. That is  what the majority of Chinese miners wanted. Luke was the only one to somewhat deliver on that "promise" but it's not an initial 2mb increase.

@_date: 2017-02-21 23:17:45
Here's a real answer since all anyone ever wants to do here when BU is mentioned is be an ass. The idea is if 1 miner has more than 5%, say 6% then if 9/10 miners want to run segwit but the 1 miner with 6% doesn't want to then the other 9 must suffer despite there clearly being majority support (9/10). For that reason BU things 75% is better so 1 person can't grid lock things up (even though I believe there are 2-3 miners that do have over 25% so yeah...). Segwit supporters (such as myself) think 95% is absolutely necessary but I guarantee if 1 person with 6% chooses not to support it and it hits 94% they are going to magically understand BU's reasoning.
@_date: 2015-05-05 17:33:32
Circle allows debit cards and instant purchases but they started me out at only $100 per week. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:37:51
Fair points, so why not propose to use Luke's HF but keep the blocksize at 1mb instead of reduce it. Then it will increase in the future. 
If not mistaking big block supporters fear there will NEVER be an increase if core gets its way. So the compromise would have to be there. Segwit does "increase" the blocksize  but only once. 
@_date: 2015-05-02 23:58:38
Yeah they have been able to seize bitcoins and auction them... why? because those bitcoins were used in illegal activities and thus should be able to be confiscated, this man didn't do anything illegal that we are aware of. You are don't realize it but you are arguing my point, the fact that the governments are issuing regulations and can associate the transactions from person to person means there is less risk than cash (obviously im talking about using it legally) less risk means less chances for flags being raised.

A dynamic block size would be something along the lines of writing an algorithm that would use specific information to attempt to predict if the future block size needs to be bigger or lesser. What ever the variables in that algorithm uses miners can purposefully manipulate in order to expand or shrink blocks. Miners with more hashing power would benefit from manipulating the algorithm to increase the block sizes as it would take the other miners longer to validate the block giving them (who solved it) more time to start to solve the next block. They could do this for a number of blocks before allowing the blocks to shrink to a stable level.

Seriously. I promote bitcoin as the future of currency but yet when I am physically with someone on the street shopping there has never been an opportunity to use it simple and quick and impress anyone until I could go to starbucks and use the fold app to get 20% off. 
I already shop at target, my cousins GF works there and often gets me coupons and discounts when I pay with cash. I can't wait till I can tell her I get a greater discount then her employee discount just by using bitcoin. (assuming its around %20 like starbucks)

Like the post above stated they don't have to. Bitpay is a great example for anything low cost were the time needed to wait would be an issue they accept transactions after they are broadcast. Bitstamp could and probably will do the same thing once they are bigger and better. But for withdraws of big money waiting usually isn't a big factor. In fact even a 2 hour wait is still quicker than other traditional methods of withdrawing large amounts.

It probably did. Barry's syndicate won the coins meaning more coins to be dumped right now by people panicking.

I think they are pushing towards a one step USD to BTC purchasing system. They are pushing USD wallets to all 50 states which allows for instant buys/sells of BTC at that point you can hold USD and when you want to buy something in BTC instantly buy the btc and then buy it eliminating the risk of volatility. That is the 2 step process. After that i think they will make a 1 step feature. Once people can make purchases in BTC with USD merchants will start accepting it more and then the transition from USD to BTC will slowly start to fade over the next decade until we just use BTC

Lets hope Bitcoin is never gone first of all. 
Not sure... Seems like you would pay a premium for the "1:1" ratio. 
For example like a gift card. Costs $22 to get $20 or 20 USDt They take $20 and deposit into a vault that represents their assets so you can see that it is backed up. They use the extra $2 to cover the transaction fee and to profit.
Now you have $20USDt you can transfer anywhere in the world free of charge (if they accept tether) or at a extremely low cost through the BTC blockchain. (miners fee)
It would be usable anywhere BTC is accepted as well.

There is an on going investigation. there are as many damn reasons not to announce what they know as to announce.

You were complaining because they haven't explained what happened yet. If you know they are guessing why would to complain there hasn't been an explanation when you yourself understood they weren't sure enough to provide an explanation yet? you are just impatient and tripping out over nothing. If you don't like how they roll choose another exchange and move on. Or have some patience and understand that this stuff has to be investigated before they can simply cater to bitchy people. There is no reason to provide information until they aren't guessing, as this usually makes things worse

Yeah this is 101 stuff people need to learn about Bitcoin. 
There was a bubble which means the price was inflated. it was going to deflate. The hype the bubble brought lead to a bubble of mining power. Tons of people invested into mining as bitcoin was looking like it was going to the moon. 
as the bubble deflated we have an excess of mining power which will adjust to match the price.

In terms of volume and multi millions of $$$ bitfinex is one of the largest exchanges. They are by no means tiny.  And obviously thousands of people trust it already as they exchange millions every day.
@_date: 2015-01-31 00:49:04
 take a gander here that is the extent of the system I know. 
from what I understand is they use the block chain to attach a token to any specific value of fiat which then can be used at that value anywhere Tether is accepted. It is kind of similar to Ripple or an IOU service. 
So you can say spend say $1USD for $1USDT that USDT can be transferred by the block chain to any wallet or service that works with the tether and used at that value thus avoiding all volatility. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 08:12:19

The dumpers are starting to slowly buy back in as the feel more confident the price is going to go up instead of down. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 18:33:34
I think it will strongly depend on how mainstream bitcoin is by that date. If there is a strong purchasing demand and bitcoin can be used for every day tasks then I think with less coins being dumped the price will go up do to people purchasing coins and them being more scarce which will lead to a doubling of the price and HOPEFULLY if the miners cash out they will pay in BTC at that point.

This is why Gavin Andresen is telling people to avoid bitcoin for the time being. 
To many people panic buying and selling on a daily base. Only leads to more bad news and angry "investors" I just hope that something causes the price to go up 1,000 in a very short period of time when and if it ever does so those that didn't hold have a hard time buying back in. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 03:14:05
I am pretty sure they literally said exactly what happened. 
"On January 4th, some of Bitstamp’s operational wallets were compromised, resulting in a loss of less than 19,000 BTC. This breach represents a small fraction of Bitstamp’s total bitcoin reserves, the overwhelming majority of which are held in secure offline cold storage systems. We can assure customers that any bitcoins held with us prior to temporary suspension of services on January 5th at 9am UTC are completely safe and will be fully honored. "

@_date: 2015-01-05 21:56:00
Yeah when they announced that, it was what made me start thinking about fixed BTC. Arizona unfortunately isn't supported right now but hopefully it will be soon. The difference is they aren't holding the BTC so like you said its a two step process which if you are fast you shouldn't have to worry about the volatility. Then again they require I think ~30 minutes of confirmations to get the BTC I think its 6 confirmations.  
@_date: 2015-05-05 00:30:55

It strengthens BitCoins foundation. In other words it gives Bitcoin a greater opportunity and chance to grow and expand into something beautiful. 
As far as the price goes. The stronger the foundation the greater the chance the price increases in the long run. 
You wont see a spike or a super fast increase in the price in fact you may see it unaffected for sometime but now the chances it doesnt fail and does go up in the future are greater
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:16:52

Bitcoin Best Bid (BBB) if one exchange is ALWAYS the best place to sell Bitcoin its going to use that exchange genius. In this case it was still seeing bitstamp as a usable exchange even though it was halted. All other exchanges were lower value so basically bitpay was probably losing a bit of money until they disabled bitstamp as a source.
@_date: 2015-01-10 05:42:54
I don't think changetip technically falls under that category. If it does then I guess yes they have been doing what they are doing for awhile now so apparently so

@_date: 2015-01-22 18:55:47
See my example below, it shouldn't be that hard to wrap your mind around.
The only time an exchange would reference smaller units is if 1 BTC becomes worth 1,000,000,000 or more which is not likely to happen. 
think about fiat. in USD for example we have 1$ and then quarters worth .25 and dimes .10 and nickels .5 and pennies .1 why would we make something worth less than a penny?

Most services will force a small fee for transfers as this helps ensure the transaction is propagated. In other words the higher the transfer fee the higher the priority the transaction has to be included in the next solved block. While most services force the fee for this reason (convenience) it is not technically required (some services don't force the fee). If you search the reddit for people who have sent transactions without fees you'll learn it can take days to transfer and sometimes it is returned and they have to attempt the transfer all over again.
@_date: 2015-05-04 20:16:04
I am grateful for all of Gavin's hard work towards demonstrating that increasing the blocksize is safe and doable, however I think before any hard fork is performed we need a detailed, organized presentation of ALL possible methods for handling the block size issue before we demand or push for any 1 single solution. Sometimes there are multiple solutions and some are better than others. 
I don't mean any disrespect but sometimes when someone comes up with their own personal solution and puts forth a lot of time working towards something they have a tendency to get offensive to any other solutions and only want to see their solution work. I almost feel as if Gavin is becoming hostile to the fact that some people are reluctant to accept his proposal. 
I agree with him that this needs to be debated right now and brought to light. I think we need to somehow determine a date or a convention or something where everyone and anyone working on a solution to the block size limit can prepare their proposal and they can all be presented, then we can push for one or the other. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 20:55:59
Hard forks are the  thing we want to avoid, that is why there is no harm in exploring all possible solutions. Even if Gavin's solution is what ultimately is the best option I am all for it. But we do still do have time so let's approach this as cautiously and thoroughly as possible.

I just don't get your logic or anyone who thinks the same for that matter. If you are paranoid by the lack of information then don't use the exchange? It really is not that complicated. If you have thousands of $$ and don't feel comfortable than for the love don't use the exchange. 
If they are losing potential customer's by not being more detailed that is their fault. 
In my opinion it has always been better to figure out solid details before communicating to the public. They would rather lose customer's than cause some un warranted mass panic.

Hence my edit referring to the average joe. The average Joe is not going to actively look into a way to save 3% for some small IT job. 
Also as I mentioned the only field BitCoin has been gaining substantial ground for the average Joe is remittances. 
I have bought a few electronic components with my collection. But nothing else.
I know 100 places I can get bitcoins. But I know 0 places I can easily spend them for day to day things. Once there is a wide range of day to day places that accept them and give incentives. THEN the average joe AKA mass adoption will commence. 
As long as the merchant is getting the 3% fee consumers don't give two shits about swiping a CC

It doesn't create more Bitcoin though.
If you take a gold bar worth $1000 and someone is selling something for $500 you divide it in half to make 2 units worth $500 each they aren't worth $1000 each. you can now purchase $500 easier. 
Now say that $1000 old bar goes up in value to $2000 you would need 4 units to make that purchase.
What I am getting at is you can keep chopping that gold bar in half over and over and over does this give you more gold? No

And I am all for that honestly, I don't know if I didn't make my previous statement clear but just because that was the original design doesn't mean it's guaranteed to be the only and BEST solution. I know there are other solutions being developed that could potentially be a one time fix verses simply a step in the right direction. One thing I have learned as an engineer major is when you have the time you want to explore all options before settling with something. Gavin is definitely the most pro active developer as of right now, he is working towards it, blogging about it, showing results and counter arguing those who don't agree. 
I am not saying his solution won't ultimately be the best thing for bitcoin but we do need to compare and debate all solutions.

The thing that makes me scratch my head is cores visions "can" co-exist with bigger blocks. EVERYTHING they want to accomplish can happen with bigger blocks. The ONLY problem that creates is that if bigger blocks solve the scaling problems that gives people a choice to simply stay on chain or use all of their awesome implementations. I don't see the harm in people having a choice between the two. They simply can't argue any more that it is to risky. the only risk is being created is by themselves. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 18:13:29
I honestly think the main reason more people aren't buying is because the VAST majority of everyone I know thinks it is too expensive! 1 Bitcoin is $300... that is what they all say.

Move to one that hasn't been breached? How does one guarantee that it won't get breached?
Had bitstamp been breached before this? Because if not it could be one of those exchanged, "That haven't been breached"
My point is, it is dangerous to expect perfection. It is also dangerous to not give 2nd chances... sometimes. 
There is no reason people shouldn't move their coins to another exchange. But I also think breaches can make exchanges safer as they now know how to defend a bit better.
@_date: 2015-01-29 04:48:33

Did you see the straw poll that was thrown out there last month I think the majority said they would support a HF this year. 
Clearly the division is between no segwit no HF vs HF block increase. That's the division. You can't deny that. Now why can't we compromise and try and narrow the division? To me a slight block increase + segwit as a HF. Gives both sides what they want with low risk. That could completely destroy the division. I don't understand why that compromise is not satisfactory accept the egos I see.

Well it is good that you can see that, how ever it is unfortunate that investors and holders (the people that gives bitcoin value) have the mind set that "If we don't increase we are doomed." People are dumping, they are selling, they are loosing hope because they think this needs to happen and happen NOW. It would mostly be to try and comfort them... However in order to maintain a spam attack at 2MB its 2x as expensive and only benefits the miners so it does to a minor degree help.

You are new aren't you? Lots of places don't need the block to be solved to make transactions.
Also did you catch the news about bitpays new payment gate to allow instant transactions? Once bitcoin is sent the transaction is broadcasted with 0 confirmations, bitpay pays lots of their merchants with 0 confirmations before any block is even solved. There is a certain amount of risk involved but there are ways to minimize it.
Wether exchanges choose to allow 0 confirmation transactions or 4-6 confirmations is their choice but as new safer methods for o confirmation transactions come out most people will start using them. It isn't going to be an issue going mainstream.

That average misrepresents Bitcoins True average. If you look at the price history and the evidence against the Mt Gox manipulation you can clearly tell that that manipulation started around $175-200. In other words the bubble started at about $200 if you take away that manipulation and bubble it would appear that bitcoin would have slowly grown to about what it is today. It has been going down because the bubble popped it was never really $200+ hence the price decline has been a lot less volitile and reasonable the closer it gets to that price. imo

You can't be for real with this comment, can you? You are comparing centralized companies to an open sourced, "decentralized" network? bitcoin which is open source and free to the world didn't have a bottleneck on how many transactions could be included in a block essentially allowing cheap fees for everyone. At one point the blocksize cap was placed on it intended to be a temp security solution to eventually be removed when it was safe. Now a group of people have essentially convinced the public that their free to use network shouldn't have the bottleneck removed thus forcing people to pay more than they should have to. There is more than enough data and support by the people that the block size effects (miners) and proof that that bottleneck can be expanded at least a little bit to allow people from not having to pay more for something that was never intended to have to cost more.

I'm baffled at how someone thought that warranted gold... I agree with it is in "beta," but there is A LOT of competition. If you stand around too long with with yours hands in your pocket trying to think about the PERFECT solution it won't matter too much if everyone moves onto the next best "blockchain." Even if it does end up being "superior" people won't simply return unless they need to, and anything that is good enough will be good enough for them to stay. Blockchain is hot right now and the market is deciding and choosing which direction/implementation they want to start using and a lot of them are NOT picking the bitcoin blockchain.

I'll beg to differ. It was good. Look at the ETH vs ETC graphs. ETC had it's strongest run right after the fork. As time moves forward the chances that one siphons off the other is greatly reduced. At this point they are two separate cryptos. Any new market capital for either of them is largely coming from new pockets not conversion. Rolling back the DAO is what caused the fork. The idea if immutability went with ETC, clearly the new investments into ETH are perfectly fine that that idea was nullified. Think about it the same can either happen to Bitcoin in a planned HF, or eventually some community will forcefully do it. Which way would cause less issues?

Visa charges something like ~3% per transaction. When bitcoins transaction fees are cheaper than that it can be a Global alternative. When you have more than ~3 transactions per second which is aprox what 1MB can hold then the fees go up, meaning it acts more as a settlement layer and store of value vs a currency. The idea that bitcoin could be worth 100k+ each strongly depends on it being treated as a global currency and not settlement layer, arguably.
small blocks are good and not bad if there is an alternative solution to avoid fees reaching levels higher than the current legacy systems. Other wise I will stick to my visa card.

Are you seriously that dull? a 2-4mb increase is a TEMPORARY solution that is like going from 3 transactions per second to maybe 12! You call that an ON-CHAIN scaling solution?? Core's belief is that we only need 3-12tx/s on-chain and we can have 10,000-50,000s tx/s off-chain via LN. BU wants 10,000s tx/s ON-CHAIN and a 2-4mb "increase" does not solve that concern of theirs. That is why the OP said they want it off-chain.

I agree 100% with Stephen Pair, based on his write up why wouldn't we Take what Core wants and what BU wants and combine them and perform the safest Hard Fork the crypto world has ever seen? 
If "Miners may be compelled to increase the block size limit leading to a disorderly hard fork experiment. " 
if "on the other hand, a user revolt might lead to a minority fork with equally disorderly results."
If we do a hard fork with a 95% consensus then if THOSE scenarios are inevitable, then at least they can be experimented and demonstrated with out those forks and price disruption etc etc. What am I missing!? If both sides want the best for bitcoin then maybe take a few months to include safety mechanisms for any of the malicious abuses that could come from either side just in case and add those mechanisms to the HF. 
This idea that Core's way is the safest, best and only way, and on the other hand BU believes the same thing. Why not implement both and let them compete?

I agree, well the delusional could argue its a loose interpretation of consensus, but I hear them using the term 'majority' more often as 3 of 4 fits that bill.

So the super majority off miners and most bitcoin companies all want to see core fired? If that is the case perhaps there is a decent reason in the fact that there is enough consensus to hard fork bitcoin to 2mb. Ever think of that? 
You do realize that classic in no way can cause bitcoin to hard fork other than write the code and hope the super majority of the HOLDERS/MINERS actually use that code. Classic can only debate and influence people to hard fork.

People are using it instead that is why there is such a hot debate about how to scale bitcoin so it remains more useful than paypal or swift because ATM it isn't, the fees are ridiculous. How big depends on the side you ask! Core thinks those transactions can be done off-chain to keep block size small. BU has a chart out there that shows what the estimated growth rate is and how fast blocks will grow, so they don't really care how big blocks get. you can buy a 2TB MICRO SD card these days so yeah that is the debate.

I agree that has happened and will continue to happen. I don't love nor really hate it but the decentralization/centralization debate has taken a toll on bitcoin development. A lot of decisions are being made to prevent further decentralization or improve it. I guess my point being is with ASIC mining corporations being directly tied to the price of bitcoin and their expenses should we really be basing development decisions on decentralization and centralization? seems like we need a change at the protocol level to avoid the inevitable centralization ASIC mining has brought.

Around a year ago all major miners contributed to a graph stating what size their networks could handle and they all said 2MB wouldn't be any more of a problem than 1MB in fact the majority of all miners said that their networks could handle 8MB. I am not saying we should increase the blocksize but It would be nice if you would stop bitching about 1MB being "already to big" or "too much to handle" until you can prove that the miners networks can't handle it you really should stfu. the 1MB block size HAS NO RELATION to the current centralized state of mining. we are where we are at because they were able to capture a high enough % of the hash rate in the early game making the entry level for competition absurdly high. 0.2MB block sizes WOULD HAVE NOT CHANGED WHERE WE ARE AT. 
No one has said, "well we would have tried creating a mining farm  to further decentralize bitcoin but we can't afford to compete with the network requirements of 1MB blocksizes and the % of has we would need to be profitable given expenses. what fantasy land do you live in. 
similarly no one is saying, if we lower the blocksize it will be affordable to mine.

Sure but those still use legacy payment rails so the merchant is still getting charged 2-4% plus usually a flat rate fee on top of that.

I believe it was 75% in all fairness but it's actually making a lot more sense to me now seeing as we are at 90% and it appears the remaining 5% we need is a rogue mining company that probably has no idea what is going on and therefor if no one reaches out to them CSV isn't going anywhere at which point YOU can't validly argue that consensus was "technically" reached it's just a mining group that wasn't paying attention. The idea behind 75% was given that so few groups control enough % it wouldn't be fair if every group accepted it except 1 and this preventing it from ever happening which is what is happening right now.

BU devs aren't the ones blocking Segwit hate to break it to you. They verbally oppose an "on-chain, never hardfork approach to Bitcoins immediate and long term future" but they aren't blocking it by any means. The miners who should in theory keep the users best interests in mind get to choose to accept it or not. Keep in mind the miners are going to base their decisions on what will keep their businesses profitable. In reality Core and BU should be arguing the profitability/stability of both implementations. I think we will see segwit get approved but I think secretly everyone knows we need to shed this idea that hard forks are bad and we will eventually need to embrace them in the most delicate and proper of manners.

Is there anyway to know how much hashrate any single entity has? If so why couldn't we just create sub blockchains which blocks get merged onto the THE blockchain and cap the amount of hashrate a single person can own at like 10-20%. allow an infinite number of sub blockchains but of course the difficulty be based on the sum of all the sub blockchains? Could something like that work? That way someone who has a shit ton of ASICS can effectively still get 75% of the total hashrate without the risk of a 51% attack or what ever while leaving the other 80% for competition I dunno something along these lines.. Or maybe this could be done with side chains? once you exceed 20% of the hashrate on a giving sidechain a new one is created.

This is building bridges. The moment enough people own bitcoin and it can actually scale and be used as a currency of course businesses will start to receive bitcoin directly because it saves them money. 
I couldn't fucking pay for all my living expenses with bitcoin so guess what I had to do?? keep a % of my wages in FIAT. I got the shift card months ago and guess what? I know get paid in BTC and i have converted essentially all my net worth into BTC with a stop limit sale at the price I bought in for safety. Now that I get paid in bitcoin that has had a far better effect on bitcoin then letting that money sit as FIAT. so use your brain and understand that its not bad to build a bridge knowing that we only need it to get across and never go back, fool.

That is actually a sign the network is healthy (more transactions = healthy, less transactions = not healthy), don't confuse that as me saying we don't need to figure out how to avoid back logs, because we damn well do need to fix it. There is no rules to how many transactions anyone is allowed to make. The more the better, especially once we can fit more transactions onto the blockchain/~10mins

Centralization of certain aspects is okay as long as there is a decentralized alternative. With side chains I believe everyone will have access to what they feel is important. In the future I can see several cryptos being successful. x coin that is centralized/decentralized in aspects. y coin that is centralized and z coin that is fully decentralized. As long as they can all co exist under governmental regulations (which some wont) it shouldn't matter. The technology is here to stay.

I ended up taking fluconazole 150mg once every week for 2 months. 
the problem with lamasil was that I had tried the topical cream but the source of my fungus nail was internal candida bacterias (another fucking joke, the fact the external stuff wont even work on nearly every fungus nail case and if it does its guaranteed to be temporary). Creams do not soak through the toe nail well enough to kill it and if it had any impact what so ever the fungus would just come back. So I had to turn to oral solutions. Oral Lamasil still requires a prescription in the USA. But once i started taking fluconazole within 2 weeks there was a clear result that the cause was something internal.

Absurdly limited is kind of a stretch when "legit" transactions are still within the 1MB block size. I don't think people realize that on average a good % of those filled blocks are pointless spam transactions. Raising the limit won't necessary deter those from spamming the network. I think the best solution in the mean time is to develop some method of predicting how much of a fee is necessary to beat the spam and have that default in every wallet. Until the spammers can spam the network with high enough fees to really make a bigger issue i think we have some time to get the block size increase done the right way.

People will move bitcoin to any altcoin when the pumping and hype starts. Bitcoin isn't that useful as a currency still but it has a lot more money invested into making that a reality while litecoin can hope to piggy back on its success. In the long run I still think litecoin won't even be 1/10th of the value of bitcoin. As soon as bitcoin gains momentum most litecoin users will convert straight back into bitcoin.

Medical care in the USA is a fucking joke. I was going to have to spend 600-1000USD to take care of a couple fungus nails on my feet after trying every possible home remedy and over the counter medicine possible. Hardly any insurance plans cover that type of cost. cost me 10$ in Brazil with no prescription required. 
The bigger joke i discovered after all of this is the medicine I took is the same medicine vets give dogs here in the USA for certain types of fevers at a fraction of the cost it would have costed me to get the same medicine for my feet. If I had pretended I needed it for my dog and saw a vet I could have gotten it for 100-300$ but still way to much.

Owning my own bitcoin friendly business I would have been happy to refer all my customers to coinbase if it weren't for the fact when I try to validate my address to use the USD wallet I get an unknown error. First email response said that it happens to younger customer's especially when something changes on their tax forms. 
Second response I got was that there isn't anything they can do and hope to be able to validate every customer's state in the future. Seems kind of pathetic they can't manually request what ever information they needed as I would have been happy to have provided it.

You are so wrong it hurts. 1 USD = 6.21 Yuan at the time of this post. They may only charge $8 to send 2,999 but they convert those dollars at a ratio of 1 USD = 6.06 Yuan....

damn straight because even if it takes 1 hour that is still a hellalot faster to actually transfer value from point A to point B using the current system. Not only faster but eliminates fraud! a number of companies already offer 0 confirmation transactions as well and that number will only grow.

Wonder if this has any relation to the issue I was experiencing.

I personally am interested to see if bitcoin does become the global currency if it "HAS" to be pegged to something that actually is considered valuable.

Good solutions IMO. I think the  priority in the mean time is to make sure every wallet has the ability to adjust fees manually, can predict the minimum required fee for fast confirmation times, and the public needs to be educated on how fees impact confirmation times so that they know to adjust those fees when needed.
If everyone understood how the fees impact confirmation times and had the ability to adjust and 3rd parties like coinbase auto adjusted their fees there really wouldn't have been very many legit,. time dependent transactions getting hosed up in the spam. 
This will at least help alleviate the pain caused by spammers tell your recommendations become reality. 
And honestly I didn't have a single issue sending out during that spam, I paid $.055usd and didn't really mind that amount  
@_date: 2015-07-15 05:13:35
no you can't unless the banks are across the street and you are literally withdrawing cash from one and depositing in the other. what you are transferring "faster" is an IOU. When Bitcoin is used as a currency aka "digital cash" it is literally the same as handing cash to a person anywhere in the world not a pathetic IOU and having to actually meet up with them in the future to give them that cash.

technical problems core developers have explained? I am not aware of technical problems core developers have explained that they have proven to hold water. The thing is, is bitcoin has worked with 1MB for over 5 years, some have claimed the code is sloppy and needs cleaned up but an increase to 2MB isn't going to make the code "sloppier" in fact optimizations come with the 2MB hardfork and segwit. The majority of bitcoin developers in general have stated that 2MB are safe. I may not have links handy at the moment but the only concern I remember being hotly debated was that 2MB call for more bandwidth which could force some miners out further centralizing bitcoin. Since then miners have all states they can handle 2MB just fine so that argument is out the window. Even then it is debatable if we already have became "centralized"

There really isn't.. Not that I can see. Blockstream and Core can implement all of their 2.0 features on top of any size of blocks. In fact they have said they will need bigger blocks. They just don't feel they are necessary yet. Well unfortunately a lot of people feel otherwise so they can try and stall a block increase for what ever reason or embrace one now while another team is doing all the coding and testing for a 2MB increase. 
It really doesn't make much sense unless they only want to increase the blocks just enough for their 2.0 features to work so people have to resort to their 2.0 feature for scaling instead of being able to simply do it on chain.

Thanks. You are right I remember reading about that. Two things come to mind first is:
where Matt explains how both can happen if the HF is changed to 1.5MB instead of 2MB 
And second, not forgetting for segwit to take advantage of the artificial increase it depends on how transactions are relayed which means that in course of adverse effects there is the ability to control what is acceptable. Also miners didn't determine 2MB to be ok the determined up to 8MB to be ok but since then people who want to keep transactions on the block chain have compromised down to 2MB.

Yes and yes. I don't mean to give people the wrong impression I like the core developers. They do a lot of work and bitcoin. But neither of those sources really claim a HF is bad in fact they said there will be one eventually they simply disagree it needs to happen now. No one can change the fact other devs and holders/investors believe other wise. At that point either a civil war starts or people compromise. have you seen. ?
There is proof both can happen given both sides what they feel is best for bitcoin.

2MB as long as they don't contribute to further centralization ( which evidence shows it wont ) also helps the ecosystem. Core can do every single thing they want to do with any size of blocks there is no reason they should fear bigger blocks and create all this unnecessary fear that something catastrophic is going to happen if a hardfork occurs. They need to just embrace it.

The concepts are the same, I don't know if they have different methods of storing the value in terms of fiat. 
Bitreserve does have more options for the store of value though such as gold silver etc. 
I think tether might be more fluid too but I don't know I have read in depth about the services but I know one of their pitches was the ability to tether tokens anywhere bitcoin is accepted, so that gives me the impression they can switch between fiat and BTC fairly quick where as when I hear about bit reserve I always hear about it being simply a way of locking the value.

We need more centralized blockchain based technology start ups to well, start up... and then fail so people can start to see why the bitcoin aspect of the blockchain is what allows all those block chain applications to exist and function.
People are absolutely correct in saying that the blockchain aspect of bitcoin is where the true technology is at because well it's true. Many many cool things can be done with the blockchain technology no one is denying that. Its easier for people to see the potential in the blockchain. So the people that claim the real potential lies within the block chain are probably correct. The people are wrong however when they say that the block chain technology can exist without bitcoin.

The more people familiar with bitcoin and using bitcoin the more potential it has to make an impact on the market. The more merchants save with bitcoin the more incentive they have to offer discounts for bitcoin purchase which in effect attracts more bitcoin customers. 
My friends want to invest into bitcoin but they want to be able to spend it at more locations. This solves their problem thus on boarding more users. Their and my payment method of choice will ALWAYS be bitcoin but should it not be accepted now we can use Visa's rail. It really doesn't make sense how you see this as "burning down the bridge." You act as if people want to get bitcoin debit cards for the purpose of not spending bitcoin, that isn't the case or they would just use a traditional debit card attached to a bank or credit union.
@_date: 2015-11-19 02:19:38
I think that is a short sighted assumption. 
First of all you have to buy them to spend them that way. 
It really will only help bridge the gap. The more people that can spend them the more incentives the stores will have to start accepting bitcoin directly, as they save money.

If you do a few searches you will understand that a lot of these big companies and organizations are simply using the work Blockchain because of what bitcoin has accomplished. Blockchain is all the rage so they are using their own "blockchain" No... they are using an open database and nothing more. It annoys me they abuse the word blockchain. 
Blockchain wasn't even a think until bitcoin made it a thing. The block chain is a decentralized peer 2 peer open ledger. They don't have that and unless they have a token and make it p2p they are not using a blockchain.

I think you're right. Or perhaps Wright does believe that the real Satoshi if alive would still not reveal his identity to disprove Wright if by some miracle people started to believe him.

The problem is a lot of merchants don't care about accepting them directly. At least if a merchant can indirectly accept them and they start to notice a decent % of their sales via bitcoin debit cards or NFC methods they may change their minds after realizing that they could have saved 1-3% on all those transactions accepting it directly.
Coinbase did a good job at gathering data from all transactions done with the shift debit card showing how much was spent and where. This type of data will help convince merchants to accept it directly.
one step at a time.

The first auction went for above market prices. There for there was no reason to sell the BTC. The next 2 auctions were around auction price so again no real reason to have sold.

There is evidence, proof no. Kleiman was active on the mailing list that Satoshi eventually released the draft for bitcoin. There is evidence Kleiman was involved in bitcoin in the early stages. No one knows how early, and the one person that would know the most is his brother who is in the possesion of the USB that Craig wanted and called his family after his death to tell them to take care of his belongings as there could be a wallet.dat file that has a huge amount of bitcoin. Ira Kleiman's brother has been lips sealed ever since learning that Kleiman could have been in possession of such fortunes.

Not sure why exactly you believe they have low credibility but perhaps I don't know as much about them as I should. I think most peoples argument against Gavin is the fact that he wants bigger blocks on-chain scaling solutions and believes Wright is S. Out side of those "Reasons" Gavin has contributed immensely to bitcoin and has indicated in every way that he wants what he feels is best for bitcoin, not by force but providing his belief publicly to garner any support should people agree with him. I too think there is much more detail regarding the Tulip trust fund and what dealings and drama went down with Kleiman and other potentials "satoshis" other wise Wright wouldn't have needed a NDA to protect what most likely is a rundown with some legal systems.

the MMM structure began in Russia and is used all over the world now. That article explains it better. In china they use Bitcoins a lot with it.

You can compare the chinese exchanges volume and it is clear 2 are way more popular than the other. these are not controlled investors that is obvious as 1+1 so for all you down voting me just wait and see for yourself.

I hear ya, what I imagine is he knew Kleiman was the creator of bitcoin and when he passed away he scavanged as much information data as possible but wasn't able to get anything absolute. So now he is trying to use what he did get which is moderately convincing to tie himself to Satoshi. That to me is why they are dumb things that are going to get shot down because he is so damn close to being able to pull it off but is missing the essentials. 
I think he knows he lacks that definitive piece of data to absolutely "prove" so he is just using what he was able to get to try and convince since he knows it aint going to get any better than that.

I think Gizmodo is spot on actually. Sounds like Craig might of indeed had the idea, told it to Kleiman. Perhaps Kleiman was better with the technical aspects of it and thus he was controlling the early bitcoins mining. Two guys cruising along trying to decide what to do being private about it. Drafted up a trust and Kleiman's unfortunate death resulted in the lose of the bitcoins perhaps. perhaps Ira has his usb and the coins and is waiting for his lawyer's to reinstate his will so he will inherit at least some of the bitcoin. Craig clearly wants his portion as they were in it together he feels its partially his property as well. 
I mean damn, let's face the facts. A draft for a trust securing ~1M bitcoins should be proof enough they were in control of them. I don't think people can be ignorant anymore. Craig is probably speaking to so many lawyers he can't directly explain what is going on but wants to establish himself as the creator in order to assure he gets his property back. 
You can deny it all you want but until further evidence comes out I don't think Gavin was tricked at all. He is at least Satoshi's right hand man, or he at least had the idea in which Kleiman put into fruition. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 00:53:10
Based off what I have read, is if this trust was a valid thing there is more to it than we know. Ira has lawyers involved and Wright may have breached the contract making him potentially invalid to receive sole property after the supposed 15 months etc.
Wright actually said that if several people sent him bitcoin to one of the first addresses he would send it back to them in order to avoid having to move the bitcoins, because he essentially can't do to the trust and legal mumbo jumbo going on(implied). Could be fake excuses, could be legit excuses.
But the facts we do know is that Ira (Kleiman's brother) is in possession of Kleiman's USB and has hired a lawyer and has referred to seeking rights to supposed wealth. Why Ira would hire a lawyer and stay silent with what he knows about Kleiman is up for speculation but I doubt someone would go through the trouble for nothing. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 16:48:51
Also from the Gizmodo piece: 


Seems to me that Wright is probably the "hacker" tipping Gizmodo trying to set himself up. Why he would do that? Well if he knew Kleiman started bitcoin and no one else did.

Of course I read it, you apparently missed the point. I own a store and I am charged ~4% for a credit transaction and I don't receive the funds for up to 30 days (Brazil). If a customer pays with bitcoins I give THEM the 3% discount. 3% off using Bitcoin is SOME incentive for people to adopt it. 
You are right merchants do save with cash. But its cool to share the same benefits of paying with cash using an electronic method such as bitcoin. 
I think my argument here is that a bitcoin debit card doesn't circumvent using bitcoin. It only gives people the ability to spend their bitcoin somewhere that doesn't accept it. If they have a bitcoin debit card they obviously have bitcoin. If they have a bitcoin debit card they have a digital wallet with bitcoins on their phone and thus can choose to use the card or in the case the store accept bitcoin directly use their digital wallet.
For me as a merchant if I notice 20% of my transactions are with a bitcoin debit card and I learn I can save 3-5% if i start accepting bitcoins of course I would choose to accept it!! How do you not understand that? A new Bitcoin debit card user has to purchase bitcoin that raises the marketcap of bitcoin. Think about an extreme example. if Shift is successful and a large number of people start using a bitcoin debit card even if they buy/spend equally merchants will start to see a higher number of payments and have more incentive to start accepting bitcoin directly.

I had the same impression, it is unfortunate Gavin signed a NDA before he spoke with Craig. Craig clearly convinced him and despite Gavin's push for big blocks I don't see him trying to con the community, he very much has a passion for bitcoin. It makes sense Craig would make Gavin sign a NDA giving that Craig himself probably can't divulge much given his legal predicament. 
I think it is safe to say Craig had the idea and Kleiman helped grow it into fruition, maybe even more technically than Craig himself did.

no not all users have to have a block chain or node on their computer I used bitcoin for a year before I installed a full node. Those that do simply do it to help the network
Those who run nodes have to run the latest version. When new versions come out you update to the newest version to rejoin the same version of the decentralized network thus getting the new features. 
the rules are enforced because if you are not running the same version you can not be part of the network and thus not get the benefits.

Craig or "satoshi" never asked for write access in fact he made it clear it was out of his hands and he was fine with that. besides he wouldn't necessarily be able to do anything with write access any ways. 
Core has a grudge against Gavin because he believed in a different direction than they did for bitcoin and he tried to give the public the option to side with him. THAT is the only reason they don't want to give it back. I like core, but it upsets me that they think they can govern bitcoin development already. I doubt Gavin cares though. I think he was done contributing, at least under their philosophy of what bitcoin should become.

that is true, sadly a projection is all one can do, but it does give some insight. I just don't think a destitute death makes it any less likely that he could have started bitcoin was my point.

nah, "supposedly" Wright realized after he claimed he was going to move early coins that he can't do that because they are all tied up in the 1.1M bitcoins in the Tulip trust he created with Kleiman.

I think his reason in 6 months is the Tulip Trust that supposedly is in control of the coins is supposed to have some hearing in September. Gavin knows this, Craig probably explained it to him hence the NDA he had to sign. I personally think it is too early to claim "bamboozled" If there is the slightest sliver of validity to this Trust that was drafted in 2013 between Craig and Kleiman to hold aprox 1.1M bitcoins then that at least makes him a damn close associate to Satoshi (essentially Kleiman himself). At that point it wouldn't be hard for Craig to deceive Gavin as he would be familiar with communications with Gavin. 
You may be ready to call him a blatant liar, but I don't believe he would blatantly lie, he clearly was told and saw more than we did and can't talk about it because of the NDA. That would make anyone lose their mind amongst a ton of harsh criticism knowing you saw and heard more than they ever will and can't say shit because you signed a NDA.

My opinion is if the masses decide that Bitcoin is a valid currency and we reach mainstream adoption before the halving then we will see a big jump in the price. Everything IMO depends on if the masses see bitcoin as a legit investment or currency/commodity, whatever. If everyone is still waiting for that "something" to happen to decide if they should get into bitcoin or not we will only see the few enthusiasts buying bitcoin before the halving causing a mini bubble that will burst fairly quickly. 
If you look at gold that rarity has not always correlated with price but more so with those who believe gold is a great investment. Once everyone who likes the idea of gold was already satisfied with their investment a huge decrease in supply wouldn't really motivate them to invest even more into something. If no one else becomes interested and invests well the price wont really increase.

There is no direct reason someone should do what you are describing. It is essentially cheaper and quicker to transfer bitcoins thus making it cheaper and more profitable for companies and stores to accept, thus some stores and companies will offer discounts for paying with bitcoin. That is the incentive to pay with bitcoin, but if they don't offer an incentive then like you are saying there isn't a big reason to not just pay in cash UNLESS you utilize bitcoin for it's many other utilities. 
For example I have family and friends in another country and can send them bitcoins practically instantly. I can't do that with cash so that alone is reason for me to have a couple hundred $ in bitcoin and well hell if I can pay for my meal or a bill with it to no reason not to.

If you are familiar with Torrent files or peer-to-peer it works more or less the same way. 
The blockchain is a list of all transactions that have ever taken place. The miners confirm the transactions form blocks of transactions that then get updated on the block chain. those who run full nodes choose to keep a copy of all the transactions ever made. The more people that choose to run a full node the more copies of the blockchain exist which means in simple terms. If the network (nodes) go down do to power outage in one part of the world there are still thousands of other copies of the block chain for the network to use to record transactions. 
The more nodes you have the harder it is to take down the network. In theory you only need a handful of nodes for transactions to be recorded for bitcoin to function. But obviously if there are only 2-3 online nodes a hacker or government could easily shut those computers down and thus stall the network. When you have thousands distributed all over the world the chances of taking every node offline at the same time is nearly impossible. 
Bitpay has already talked about launching nodes into space even.
If you don't have a full node running and use bitcoin you simply use other peoples nodes to store that transaction that was made. 
there are also ways to only run a partial node and lite versions that don't require the full block chain

segwit is already available, 95% of the miners have to adopt the code for it to go in affect. After it is in affect we still have to wait for 2016 blocks to be mined with segwit for it to become active. only 40% of the miners have started running it the others are wanting/waiting for core to do some other things before they will start running it so by the looks of it, it hasn't even got to the first phase of going live.

The thing is an unbound limit will always have implicit bounds when there is a reason to try and keep those limits as small as possible. For example, miners get to pick and choose which transactions to include in their blocks. Its not like it is cheap to try a DDoS styled attack on the network, in fact the bigger the block size is the more expensive and difficult it would be for a a DDoS styled attack to even have an impact on legit transactions. IMO we need to spend more time trying to develop filters to weed out "malicious transactions" to the point were all we need to worry about is being fair with bandwidth limits for miners which hilariously basically 98% of the entire hashing power has stated that they have enough bandwidth for 2MB blocks even up to 8MB blocks, so there really is no argument that up until that limit further decentralizations will occur.

The amount of people involved in bitcoin is literally nothing... the fact its ~$300 with as few people actually involved is pretty amazing. For Bitcoin to be successful the market cap HAS to inevitably increase by at least 100x what it currently is and that would account for the annual remittance market alone. So if you do the math you will see a very realistic potential for the price per BTC. Now ask yourself are we going to gradually increase to a market cap 100x? or at some point is everyone going to realize we are inevitably heading there and invest while it is cheap? Look at most hugely successful companies. They grew exponentially. Bitcoin will do the same. How long it takes to hit that point is each to their own. But if we get to that point in 2016 it will most certainly be more than $500 a coin.

The way I understand it is if you the "surfer" make the site/publisher some money in ad revenue you get 15% of what ever they were going to get. 
It is the surfers right and freedom to use a browser that displays websites/content the way they want to see it. Surfers don't have to use a browser that displays adds, they are "overlays" they are additions to the content being displayed. Millions of people these days use adblock or even better extensions to completely avoid ads which results in less ad revenue for the sites/publishers.
Brave is basically saying, "Hey let's give the surfers that are deciding to not see ads a % if they choose to see adds." From a publisher's stand point giving the surfer a cut for generating them money is better than not generating any money at all.

His new blog post claims nothing more than to publish articles/documents etc related to the early days.. AKA things he stole from Kleiman. He will be very careful and select with what information he releases because he can only release things he is certain only he knew about or can't be traced back to Kleiman.

You say it like bitcoin is going to be how it is right now forever... Most things that you find easy to use chances are they weren't easy in the early stages. Bitcoin is not mainstream yet and bitcoin as you know it won't be anything like it is now in the future when it is mainstream. 
But I explained it in 5 minutes to a friend and he downloaded the coinbase app attached his bank account purchased bitcoin and used it to buy a gift card in no time flat with 0 confusion so maybe some people are either smarter or beg to differ. 
There are already a number of people that are creating IDs to go on top of the public address so you can simply send your name like you would an email to someone and allowing you to save addresses with ID's so when you want to send BTC to someone you just select their name in your contacts list etc...

what is strange is the volume in china has no logical basis. The only semi logical explanation is that China's government is going to regulate their currency or devalue it further. But that is iffy at best in explaining the increase in volume. USD&lt;&gt;BTC exchanges are only going up to do arbitrage opportunites with chinese exchanges. They are driving our prices up. Who is investing so much money? My guess is a ponzi scheme which intends on running away with their customer's money. BTCC Issues a warning that a lot of their transactions are going to a famous ponzi group... I believe that group just dumped their BTC either on Bitfinix (se the 10k BTC sell off and explain that while the price is bullish?) to hide their trail or converted to LTC to hide their trail. a spike like that usually has a very different explanation then simply " common interest in LTC leading to investors."

I believe their profits and ability to stay afloat heavily depends on the CC model of transaction fees etc. If they created their own centralized cryptocurrency they would still have to charge the same ~4% transaction fees. which a lot of people would be fine paying for in order to have a "digit cash" 
However that would only help BTC gain momentum because they would introduce millions of their customers to the technology and then they will all start to realize that they can do the same thing on the blockchain, be their own bank, for cheaper.
TLDR: banks aren't financially capably of low transaction fees, they are battling with debt as is.

I mean people complain about bitcoin being associated to the silk road and money laundering and illegal activities and want people to see the good over the bad how else do companies crack down on the bad side?

The only thing that leaves me scratching my head is Craig reached out to Kleiman's relatives after his death to tell them to be careful with any wallet.dat files, especially one that would probably reside on his USB stick. And why would Kleiman's brother who before Kleiman's death knew nothing about bitcoin have sought an attorney after obtaining his USB and be interested in reinstating his name on his will? Kleiman was considered to have no possessions of value, but his brother seems to have got pretty deeply involved in what exactly then?

If one is moved it will strongly indicate the other 999,999 estimated to belong to Satoshi can be moved as well. People believe that the wallet holding the early coins was most likely lost and thus the coins have been idle for many years. If 1 moves, then someone has access to all of them most likely. 450M$USD worth of bitcoin can push the price way down should they be sold.

A lot of miners have to sell immediately due to tax laws. It would either appear 1 of 2 things. 1) There isn't enough demand to offset the miners selling pressure, or 2) people who purchased coins cheaper than the current price are still selling off. Keep in mind something like \~50% of all BTC were mined prior to the price breaking $100 so that is A LOT of bitcoin that people accumulated they could still be selling for a massive profit.

I would say it will be very similar to last time. With half the coins being dumped by miners there won't be as big of dips as before allowing the price to climb until fear of missing out  steps in.
we will see less and less volatility as well I think which will help bring in investors. Day trading will become harder and more people will care less of trying to game the dumps and pumps due to OTC buying/selling.
if you can combine those things with segwit and some actual real world use of the Lightning network to give investors and merchants true hope of eliminating scaling issues the moons the limits.

If BTC is successful in becoming a global currency you do realize that to have high tps at the protocol level validators, the important people that make sure re-org attacks can't be successful would have to download a 50+Terabyte block chain? effectively limiting the number of validators that would otherwise decentralize the network and keep it safe. How is that even remotely appealing to you? You really think sacrificing SECURITY for throughput is the way to go? No how about we increase security and throughput. much better.

there seems to be a lot of technical details but no explanation as to the benefits of them. As far as I am aware this is no different than swiping a bitcoin debit card that uses a centralised exchange for the conversion of funds. The payment is still made on VISA's rails so the merchant is still going to get charged what ever they are paying VISA. This truly is only ground breaking if the merchants can side step the fees they get charged from visa, which I guess the VISA details aren't announced yet.

The other cool idea that could come from payments via bitcoin is a database synchronized with the blockchain in order to verify if tickets were paid or not practically real time. I remember paying my tickets and having to wait a week to verify that it was paid and cleared. And even then I am sure there was someone who had to verify that the money was successfully sent from my bank to the receiver etc. This would eliminate the need for anyone to have to personally verify payments. people could check their tickets number online to verify it etc.
