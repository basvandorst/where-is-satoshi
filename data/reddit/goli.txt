In the beginning, when satoshi created Bitcoin, the difficulty was 1. A regular pc could easily produce blocks.
Every 2016 blocks (roughly 2 weeks) the difficulty of the puzzle is adjusted . First adjustment occurred in block 32256, to difficulty 1.18
Next difficulty adjustment occurred in block 34272, to 1.31 
The difficulty is calculated to make the puzzle difficult enough so that somebody has a chance to solve the puzzle once every 10 minutes, on average.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:16:06
current difficulty is 1,931,136,454,487.72
The formula to binary zeroes is log2(difficulty)+32
This means there currently need to be 72.812587248 binary zeroes at the beginning.
Recently mined block hash is:
 00000000000000000040f356e5b35b0b0b60a59f2c18e35954a4dc84d154e995
this is 18 hexadecimal zeroes therefore 72 binary zeroes. But the next number is 4 in hexadecimal therefore 0100 in binary and that's where the last bit zero is.

No it cannot be used to transfer coins to exchange or to any third party. If exchange were to accept swept coins, the exchange would not be possible to allow you to trade such swept coins for anything else (other coins or cash) and that is the whole point of an exchange.
If you were to give your private key to a third party, the coin would become shared owned, and such a third party will not be able to give you anything in return afterwards because of the double spend risk.
tl.dr Send button is used to transfer coins.

If you sybil the network adjusted time, that is you control all conected nodes, you can spoof the network adjusted time. This allows you to mine a block whose timestamp is too far in future and said node would consider such a block valid. 
 I am not sure however if you can troll the clocks multiple times to adjust them to future again, once you do this.
 Probably (if you can troll the clocks) If you mine many such a blocks, the node will think that mining takes slowly, this would allow you to drop difficulty on the next difficulty adjustment.
Such an attack is pretty expensive (u have to mine many blocks) and naive (people are gonna notice the blocks have wrong times).

depends on the change. some changes require no consensus like the bech address format. other changes, like segwit are soft forks, this means all miners must upgrade to enforce new rules, but users can update as needed.
hard forks, for example allowing 9MB blocks. such a change would not only have to be supported by all miners, but also all users must update too to allow this change from a certain block height.

Yep, the price floor is determined. Lets say for example currently it costs 1572$ worth of energy to mine one Bitcoin. Then obviously bitcoin cannot be worth less than that. But if it is sold for 16412$ then the difference 16412$ - 1572$ = 14840$ is the profit pocketed by a bitcoin miner.
Now imagine some miner buys more and doubles his machines. Such a miner produces twice as much bitcoin, and  twice as much profit. 
But what happens if all the miners in the world buy more machines and double their machines?
They caused the power cost to rise 3144$, but they only generate one bitcoin worth 16412$.
The miners just decreased their profits!

hash is a calculation that creates a checksum (a digest) from a piece of information. In the context of Bitcoin, the SHA256 function is used (invented by NSA) and it is used to repeatedly calculate a block of transactions, until a magic value with zeroes in the beginning is found.
Hashing is another name for Bitcoin mining.
Hash rate is the speed of how many calculations a machine performs per second.

while running, your node knows about lots of different nodes on the network (and they know your address). this information is learned when you connect to the network, the first few nodes you connect to will tell you about many nodes.
about surrounded by a fake nodes. this is called Sybil attack.
about fake block. Depends in what sense is the block fake. If it is correctly mined block, with valid transactions in it, then your node will accept it (and tell everyone about the block). In your scenario it won't tell anyone because it's Sybil attacked.

crypto coin mining chips do one stupid calculation over and over again, as fast as possible. this is not conceptually complicated at all and there is little that can go wrong, when designing the circuits.
crypto coin mining chips are not universal calculators they cannot calculate arbitrary things.
on the other hand, computer processors are very complex, complicated beasts, because they need to be able to do anything the computer user wants. they need to run the operating system and numerous other applications. there is also the need for security concerns that conflicts with the need for maximum performance. numerous engineers are scratching their heads in quest to figure out how to design the processors of the future.

in practice no. by the time he finished calculating, the network would with almost certain probability solved the problem earlier. It would be only possible if the other competitors are also humans.
but manually calculating it has a purpose even in 2018, you can manually calculate (validate) already mined (existing) block, to see if it is indeed a valid block.

In 16 minutes he calculated one round of sha256 out of 64 rounds, however each round is calculated in the same way (that would be 1024 minutes total). Bitcoin block headers are 80 byte, this is two sha256 blocks. The result is then hashed again using whole sha256.
Doing the whole bitcoin mining calculation (bitcoin hash) would take him 3072 minutes (51.2 hours).
So after 51 hours of calculating he can look at the result, and if there are 73 zeroes at the beginning he solved a valid block, and by sending the block to the network claim the 12.5 BTC +fees reward.

The actual formula used is the number should be below target number (smaller than in the sense of mathematical comparation). This allows for a fine grained difficulty control.
Imagine bit zeroes at the beginning are counted. the possibilities are (000,001,010,011,100,101,110,111). Out from these possibilities there can be only 4 difficulties (no zeroes, one zero, two zeroes, three zeroes)

The price of coin is determined by supply and demand. Given unchanged demand and decreasing supply, the coin becomes increasingly more rare, and the price of the coin grows.
Decrease in supply also leads to a transition to a fee economy. No longer are transactions subsidized, the users pay for the operation of the network and this is why the coin becomes self sufficient and not forkable. The economic majority decides on every fork what is the real Bitcoin and the miners follow the economic majority.

You can RIGHT CLICK on an address to find a lot of information.
Then select “Private Keys” to reveal your private key for a specific address. BE CAREFUL!! Do not share this Private Key with anyone.

Once mining consumes whole percents of global electricity production, an interesting thing would happen. Miner machines will be commonplace, their price will be low and anyone would be able to get them. What would be rare to get a source of cheap power. This means no longer anyone could become a miner, people would have no way to obtain Bitcoin anymore other than buy it from existing miners for a premium.

Yes, they normally validate it. It's a completely valid transaction. Miners don't care about somebody burning their cash.
The thing is, normal adresses are random looking numbers created from private key. Meanwhile burn addresses are of two types: obvious and not so obvious.

With Bitcoin you don't have to trust anyone. You don't need to believe in anything. With other coins you have to. It's pointless to try to convince you about it, if you did not study what proof of work is.
Let me try anyways. Consensus is reached when Nakamoto rules are followed and the proof of work is the largest. The coin has a purpose. To pay in the most secure and reliable way possible. Meanwhile the purpose of altcoins is to fool an unaware observer into believeing that they actually care about those things that you mention. That they want to be fast, or that they want to become the real bitcoin or whatever. They of course would lie to you that this is not the case, that they want their coins to be useful or even convenient.
This whole altcoin thing is only about several things. For people who are pro crypto currencies, this is only about obtaining more Bitcoin. For people who are against crypto currencies, this is about destroying Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:35:05
interesting theory, but why would not the miner (actually a group of colluding miners) simply mine blocks with less transactions in them
In this way the effect on fees would be pretty much the same (raising fees to an arbitrarily high level)
It's pretty naive to think that non-colluding miners put their own spam transactions in blocks and reduce their own profits in this way.

I believe you only need to copy the wallet private key from the text file. I did similar thing in the past.
Make a disk image.
copy whole filesystem to a file using dd. Then scan the whole disk for an ascii string beginning with K or whatever is the privkey.
If this don't work or the flash disk is rekt. Buy same USB key, put the chip into other same brand flash disk.
Then you can read it again and get your  private key using the method above.

Mining pool collects a batch about 2500 transactions from the network with the highest fees, and they are put into a candidate block. 
They add another transaction called coinbase transaction, which pays the pool newly created Bitcoins + total fees of the 2500 transaction.
The candidate block has therefore about 2501 transactions in it.
Miners start solving the double SHA equation on the candidate block. The number of calculations is so vast that they calculate it more times the number of grains of sand on planet earth. In about 10 minutes some machine in the world finds the solution with zeroes at the beginning. Thus a candidate block becomes a valid block. Once this happens the block is quickly sent using the internet to Bitcoin computers (full nodes) all over the world. 
Each computer checks that no Bitcoin rule was violated and checks the zeroes at the beginning to make sure the block is valid.
Once this is true the mining pools all over the world pick up a new batch of about 2500 transasctions and the process starts again.

Branches, or orphaned blocks occur when two miners mine a block at almost the same time.
Every block contains a piece of information saying which block is the previous one (hence block chain)
What happens the two blocks race around the globe to reach as many mining pools as possible.
Every mining center, or pool considers the block they saw first as valid. however the late block, is also recorded.
What happens next, is the next mined block determines which of the two competing blocks becomes final. In other words, if 10% of miners saw block A first, and 90% of miners saw block B first. It is very likely that next block (block C) is mined will consider B as the previous block.
In this picture, the light -green was orphaned, and the miner who mined said block had lost the reward.

Yes. The miner of every block currently gets the 12.5 btc reward + the fees from transactions. Since this block only has a coinbase transaction (and no normal transactions) it gets 0 Bitcoin in fees and only gets the base reward.
However for usual full blocks miners earn 12.5 btc reward + fees on the order of 4-6 Bitcoin, thus 16 to 19 Bitcoin total.

Amount of transactions have no influence on the speed of mining. What has influence on speed of mining is deploying new machines (accelerates mining slightly) or shutting off machines (slows down mining slightly). Under normal conditions mining a block takes 10 minutes on average. When starting many new machines -like it's happening now, the mining a block can take as low as 9 minutes on average.
About fees. Yes the miners can create transactions (anyone holding Bitcoins can). Miners can of course also mine the very transactions they just created. But the net profit is 0. This is because the transaction pays for example 0.001 btc fee, and for it the miner earns the 0.001 btc fee he just spent.. 
In other words the miner had 1 bitcoin, spent it for a 0.001 fee, thus owns 0.999 of the original Bitcoin, + he just earned 0.001 fee and the mining reward is 12.5 bitcoin. so the final balance of miner is 13.5 bitcoin (the reward itself + the original Bitcoin he owned in the first place)
on the other hand if miner decides not to add any artificial transaction, he just earns the 12.5 bitcoin reward and thus owns 13.5 Bitcoin (including the 1Bitcoin he didn't spend in this scenario)

Bitcoin solves this using the worldwide network of miners mining on the end of blockchain.

About increasing the cap, in the threads you posted, Nakamoto said "Don't use this patch, it'll make you incompatible with the network, to your own detriment"
"We can phase in a change later if we get closer to needing it."
But he never actually introduced the change later.

Pooled mining decreases your reward if you hit the jackpot and your machine actually mines a real Bitcoin block. What will happen to your 12.5 reward + fees it gets distributed to people who also mined but they got unlucky.
If you solo mine, you will get no reward at all unless your machine actually solves the Bitcoin block. In this case you get the full reward.
If you want to get into mining, be sure that you have no neighbors who could complain about the noise.

It is expected that miners will transition to collect the transaction fees. This transition will happen much earlier however. When you look at the table you see that reward in year 2137 is only 1 satoshi. This satoshi must be valuable, or the fees must be very big to continue mining.

presumably on multi sig transactions, only the last signature is directly malleable. But if the attacker knows the private keys (ie attacker is the spender), in theory multiple signatures in multi sig transaction are malleable.
other chains outside segwit can attempt to fix the problem by choosing a signature standard that is known to be not-malleable, in other words, there is only one way to sign a specific transaction (not multiple ways)
however segwit seems to be a better solution overall, as it also raises the network capacity a little bit.

your theory is true of course. But it has one flaw. There exist miners who steal electricity. These miners with costs=0$ will never stop mining. So even when difficulty goes up, blocks will get mined. It will be very slow but eventually they would reach difficulty adjustment and difficulty drops back to normal. At this point commercial miners join and system continues normally.

The current Bitcoin difficulty is
    1,123,863,285,132.97
What does that number mean? The official explanation is very confusing.
A forum post offers this simple formula to convert this difficulty value to bits:
    log2(difficulty) + 32
So the current difficulty is:
    log2(1,123,863,285,132.97) + 32 = 72.031603685 bits
The latest hash calculated is for Block  with this value:
    000000000000000000a5a57aa23a58134b2f40ac2d306186140f25b09b7c196e
Adding spaces every 4 digits makes it easier to count the zeroes:
     0000 0000 0000 0000 00a5 a57aa23a58134b2f40ac2d306186140f25b09b7c196e
Every hexadecimal zero count as four zero bits. There is 72 zero bits therefore the block hash is below target.

It is not a percentage amount, but a fixed amount depending on the size of transaction.
So if you spend 10 $ or 1000000 $ you get the same fee.
But when you spend from 10 addresses to 10 addreses, you pay some fee.
But when you spend from 20 addresses to 20 addreses, you pay twice as much.
It is because the transaction is twice as big.

Yes. Each node has all UTXOs in memory. When transaction arrives, the node check the UTXO to see if they really have the money they are spending.
For example transaction from Bob 0.1 BTC to Alice. The miner node checks if Bob's UTXO has really 0.1 BTC.
Once this transaction is mined to a block, all nodes delete the Bob's 0.1 BTC and it's no longer spendable.

Satoshi’s Best Kept Secret: Why is There a 1 MB Limit to Bitcoin Block Size
It seems that late in 2010, Satoshi realized there had to be a maximum block size, otherwise some miners might produce bigger blocks than other miners were willing to accept, and the chain could split. Therefore, Satoshi inserted a 1 MB limit into the code. And he kept it a secret.
One obvious and easy-to-understand issue is that in order to be a constructive network node, you need to quickly upload new blocks to many of your 8+ peers. So 8 MB blocks would require something very roughly like (8 MB * 8 bits * 7 peers) / 30 seconds = 15 Mbit/s upstream, which is an extraordinary upstream capacity. Since most people can't do this, the network (as it is currently designed) would fall apart from lack of upstream capacity: there wouldn't be enough total upload capacity for everyone to be able to download blocks in time, and the network would often go "out of sync" (causing stales and temporary splits in the global chain state)

That is not the only problem. The major problem with smart mechanisms is that the very miners may troll/game/cheat by paying themselves artificially high fees, thus making the cap grow faster than expected/needed.
If the cap raises too fast Bitcoin will never transition to fee economy, this combined with rewards halvings means that Bitcoin miners leave for altcoin if the price of Bitcoin remains stagnant.

The immediate engineering solution is the alt-coins. They are alternative currencies that provide additional capacity for people who are not able to afford the full assurance and high degree of security of Bitcoin (the strongest proof of work chain).
Bitcoin+altcoins can easily handle the weight of the global commerce today.
The long term solution is to allow small micro payments to be done in a special way, that do not require every single transaction to be confirmed. Using smart contracts lightning allows anyone to open a channel with a counter party, pay unlimited times to each other and then close (settle) the final balances of both parties on block-chain. Lightning does not require more than one transaction to open a channel and one transaction to close the channel.

If the blocks were large, they took longer time to transfer over the network.
This means that when a miner creates a block, other miners must wait longer until it arrives before they can check the transactions. During this time they can only SPV mine.
8mb blocks are worse because miners must wait longer till the block arrives over the internet. This means more spv mining and thus less security for the coin.
I think Nakamoto did very good choice with 1mb cap that he added in version 0.3.13 of Bitcoin.

It's a slippery slope. First the miners come for the 100 years old funds. Next they
steal the 50years old funds. Soon a rule is introduced that "1 year old funds are considered lost"
And suddenly the users find themselves in a system where the theft of funds is the daily norm rather than the exception.

Cash isn't for the simple reason that they are going to  raise the block cap forever. This ensues that the fees stay close to zero and guarantees close to zero profit for miners.
Bcash routinely removes Nakamoto rules from their coin. Just like they removed the 1MB rule of Nakamoto since version 0.3.13 of Bitcoin, they removed the weekly difficulty adjustment schedule, once they realize mining revenues gonna be zero, they simply remove halvings and thus the 21Milion Bitcoin limit present since it's not on the whitepaper.

No, the wallet submits your payment just once, when you send it. After that the payment sits in a memory pool in all network nodes, waiting in queue to get mined.
Yes, it is wallet dependent. But not dependent on your wallet, but dependent of the wallet the miners and network nodes are using.
The reason why coins are "stuck" is the current rule is that coin cannot be spent multiple times. For this reason whoever you paid first counts as the real payment, when you attempt to pay again using the same coin, the next transactions are ignored by the network (for the duration of two weeks).

Sure I agree, about raising awareness. Bitcoin and crypto coins is a really new area and not well researched. What would help is some explaination of signs, causes, and solutions of individual problems caused by centralisation and how to solve them.
I think that ironically raising the blocksize could help to break up rentierist (fee-raising) miner monopoly.
On the other hand I've read some study that miners wanting to raise blocksize is by itself a sign of centralization as they earn more in fees with larger blocksize in a centralized scenario.

You describe a situation in which all miners can confirm different transactions. This would imply the more miners, the faster the capacity, more transactions can be processed which would lead to lower fees per transaction.
What actually happens all miners are solving the same transactions. Only the discoverer of the solutions confirms the highest fee paying transaction, obtaining the reward every 10 minutes when a block is mined. This means the capacity is fixed, no matter how many miners there are.
The fees are high because there is a record breaking demand for Bitcoin payments. The queue is pretty long.
The purpose of Bitcoin is not low fees. The main goal of the project is fair Nakamoto rules that cannot be violated, the strongest assurance in history that all confirmed payments are final and irreversible.

@_date: 2017-12-21 18:14:48
Miners can already increase the fees arbitrarily high simply by mining less transactions.
They get more profit, however , by making blocks full of other people's transactions.
The proof is simple suppose the miners collectively wants to increase to astronomical levels. They mine blocks with 2 transactions only (for example). This includes ONLY the transaction with the highest fee overall.
Observe people struggling to overbid each other to be the one transaction. Suddenly the fees are on the order of 1000$ 10 000$ or even 100 000$ fee per transaction.
In the free market, the situation is different. Anybody can be a miner. The new miner can mine the "expensive" transaction (let's say 100 000$ per transaction). But the new miner can also add 3000 other transactions and by doing so increase own profit. Let's assume the next translations are 90 000$ fee each (on average) so the miner earns: 100 000 + 90 000 * 3000 = 270 100 000 $ 
Yes that is right, a newbie miner would earn 270.1 grand per block. Meanwhile the evil miners would earn only 100 000$ per block.
For this reason, blocks are full of actual user's transactions.

r btc is not related to Bitcoin. It is a sub that focuses solely on an altcoin called Bcash.
The fact is regardless what he wrote in the whitepaper, the 1MB cap is introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto.
‪Satoshi's secret 1mb block limit. ‬Why Satoshi didn’t create a larger blocksize, like 8 MB:
“One obvious and easy-to-understand issue is that in order to be a constructive network node, you need to quickly upload new blocks to many of your 8+ peers. So 8 MB blocks would require something very roughly like (8 MB * 8 bits * 7 peers) / 30 seconds = 15 Mbit/s upstream, which is an extraordinary upstream capacity. Since most people can't do this, the network (as it is currently designed) would fall apart from lack of upstream capacity: there wouldn't be enough total upload capacity for everyone to be able to download blocks in time, and the network would often go "out of sync" (causing stales and temporary splits in the global chain state).”

The cap isn't going to be raised for the very reason that fees bring prosperity to the miners. Fees are very important revenue source for miners.
Miners are the reason why the Bitcoin is the most reliable, durable and profitable coin to invest to.
The Satoshi Nakamoto 1MB rule, introduced in version 0.3.13 of Bitcoin, is there to avoid chain splits caused by mining arbitrarily large blocks. Thus the limit always exists , even a Bcash coin has a block size cap. The only question is how large is should be.
In the case of Bitcoin, the decision has been made by Nakamoto to keep it at 1MB.
In the case of Bcash, there is a person in charge to decide how large it should be. This is the major flaw that makes the coin not sound investment, not a sound and unsustainable form of money.

The old system (banks etc) is this hugely insecure. They simply discovered that hackers moved funds onto bitcoin exchanges in different scenarios, so they now consider such an activity as suspicious, in belief that the your account may have been actually compromised.

The understanding is fine. However there is channel capacity. This is why the channels are called micropayment channels.
When you create channel with someone "X", you fund the channel using 0.1BTC and X funds using his 0.1 BTC this means the channel capacity is 0.2 BTC.
So you cannot now for example receive 1 Bitcoin from the network. Why? Because X sends you his 0.1 and X has no more funds to send you in the channel.
Thus it is expected that recurring (daily, or even hourly) payments would be preferred on the lightning network over monthly. Because most people would not have high enough capacity channels to get their payroll in monthly large batch.

altcoins will likely deploy their own Lightning networks, and the lightning networks will be interconnected, in the sense that you would be able to pay from Bitcoin lightning network to Litecoin lightning network for example. In this way we gain additional capacity.

Satoshis are not identifiable, if you move 4 different Bitcoins to 4 different addreses 1BTC each (using one payment), it is not specific which Bitcoin went where.
The payment basically says that the inputs are these adresses, and they moved using this transaction into outputs at these addresses 1btc each.

Your answer is discussed here:
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:16:17
They will validate to earn the fees. It's already happening, a miner today earned 5.8 Bitcoin from fees but 12.5 from the subsidy. As the subsidy drops every four years, it is expected that soon fees will contribute more than the subsidy itself, this could happen as soon as in year 2020, when the subsidy drops (halves) to 6.25 Bitcoin per block.
The year 2140 is special, as it's the year in which the subsidy drops from 1 satoshi to 0 satoshi per block. Once this happens, the grand plan of Nakamoto is complete and no more new Bitcoins will be generated anymore. The currency mining becomes 100% supported by fees alone.
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:37:49
Yes, transaction can not be larger than block. But there is another limit.
Transactions larger than 100 000 bytes (including witness at a 75% discount rate) are non-standard. 
This means were you send a over-sized transaction larger than 0.1 MB, it won't be propagated on the network. Only miners are allowed to put such an oversized transaction to a block.
But even miners cannot mine a block with transaction larger than 1MB
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:43:26
Satoshi Nakamoto introduced in version 0.3.13 a network rule that the size of Block is capped to one megabyte.
This means that no matter how many miners, it can handle a fixed numbers of transactions per 10 minutes.
Yes, without lightning network, we are capped at the current rate.

Fee market transition was inevitable. The sooner it completes the better for Bitcoin as a whole. It cements Bitcoin as the sole king of crypto, as the mining rewards are never going away.

Yes they originally invented HashCash to protect emails from spam. Nakamoto invented how to use SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm invented by NSA) to mine Bitcoins. Every coin uses different algorithm for example Litecoin uses s-crypt.
But the principle is the same. Imagine rolling dices. Your goal is to roll six on all dices. With one dice it's pretty easy , even human can do it in 6 rolls on average. With two dices, however , the difficulty is higher, you need 36 tries on average.
What they invented is a machines for rolling the dices as fast as possible. Current difficulty is the equivalent of throwing 6 on 28 dices at the same time. But the machines worldwide are so fast, that it eventually happens (in 10 minutes on average)

What LARGE amount? Like 20 million Bitcoin lost? People can easily use the remaining 1 million Bitcoin thorough the worldwide economy. As each Bitcoin  is divisible to 8 decimal places, there remains 1 000 000 0000 0000 of transaction capable units of account in the economy.
As the last Bitcoins are mined in year 2140, we expect there to be more than half of the total 21 million at year 2140 in circulation. So Bitcoin can easily remain usable for several millennia- until at least year 4100 there won't be a shortage of Bitcoin.

One potential solution is people buying into altcoins. Strangely the same individual is capable of hating Bitcoin and at the same time be a supporter, holder or even believer of an altcoin. Even though the crypto is the same. (Think Litecoin - a different flavour of the same thing)
So I think we won't ever cover 100% of people using Bitcoin but the crypto market has the potential to bank literally everything.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:30:52
Don't worry once the majority of worldwide power reserves are plugged in to the Bitcoin network, it won't grow much more beyond that point. But as it will stay profitable to mine a Bitcoin, but people would not know where to get the extra power from as everyone on the planet mines. People will start to think, maybe hoovering the room is not necessary, if I can get literally free $17 by mining instead of hoovering the floor.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:31:42
in year 2140 the mining subsidy stops. this means that no more new Bitcoins cannot be created.
However all spendable Bitcoins still exist. I can imagine parents giving Bitcoins to their children. If they don't lose it, the coin can last for many generations. The coin lasting for 1000 years is only 20 generations and this is easy to reach.
This means. Bitcoin will still exist in year 3100 or so.

I know it's 100% possible. It would be a result of mining centralization. 
In a free market, where anybody can become a miner, this is not possible to happen. A new miner can simply mine honestly and include not only the highest-fee-paying other people's transaction, but fill the remaining space filled with spam (your theory) or void (in my theory) with more actual people's transactions.
In this way the new miner would make larger profit than the colluding miners.
Another thing, is collecting a magnitudes larger fees really bad for the economy? We wanted Bitcoin to transition to fee market, but not only transition but actually to make the fees to form the majority of profit so they will not be reliant on mining subsidy in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:18:03
Miners are people.
Are you believing that miners would accumulate and never ever spend their coins?
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:13:51


Wrong, there are people that produce Bitcoins at 500$ a coin expenses or less. Consider people who steal electricity, for them it's profitable to mine at arbitrarily low price level.
Once the expensive electricity players go out of business, difficulty drops, and some players would come back.
It all depends how quickly the coin price returns to the original 10 000$ a coin level.

Yes, by signing a transaction you indirectly also sign that you are the owner of the utxo.
Lets say there is address 1A1zP1eP5QGe... Somebody signs "I am Satoshi" and the signature is 0001001010....
Now you take the three things (address, message, signature) and you can check it's really the owner of utxo. The calculation give you YES/NO answer to the question that whoever signed this has the private key to the utxo or not.

If you open a channel to someone who is a member of the Lightning network, you can transact with anybody on the Lightning network, until you run out of a sending funds, or receive until one who you are connected to runs out of sending funds.

it's not possible for all miners to pernamently flip to bcash, even if 5% true believers remain, the blockchain would still work, albeit a bit slowly.
the issue is no matter how high the inflation on bcash chain, no matter how high the profits, once most miners switch, until the profits are exthausted by difficulty raise at the bcash chain... they again find themselves competing for them, at which point the difficulty on the real bitcoin chain drops,  at which point the profits skyrocket on the real chain.

Opening another channel is the obvious solution. This way you have 0.1 + 0.1 on the Lightning network and you can spend 0.2 in total.
The less obvious solution is to do something that causes the lightning network to pay you using your existing channel. For example you can sell Litecoin for Bitcoin, they will send you your Bitcoin using lighting so you get 0.2 spendable balance using this method.

Technically, governments can ban the Bitcoin-related activities such as exchanging it against fiat currencies but practically it is impossible to do that in my opinion.

Let me warn you about B-cash. This coin is destined for a failure as the miners leave for another, more profitable ventures. This risky scenario is scheduled every halving, every 4 years approximately.
I predict that the 2020 halving will be dangerous but not fatal. The 2024 halving likewise. But mark my words, once the rewards drop to 1.5625 Bcash coins in year 2028, the miners are going to leave the sinking ship, as this cannot be profitable.

Let me just tell you this, it does so by staying profitable to mine. If its profitable to mine then all other concerns like pricing governance are secondary non-issues as the coin stays alive, healthy, and survives.
We are at stage 4 already, transitioning to fee market, and stage 5 is the lightning network.

If you were to send a transaction larger than 1MB, it would be rejected (discarded) by any node on the network you send it to.
If you modify the code of node to accept transactions larger than 100KB, what would happen if you pay using an over-sized transaction to such a node, the funds you paid will appear as 0/unconfirmed, and it will never confirm.

The picture is not very meaningful.
No, under the picture you see Bob (the person who pays) signs everything:
As illustrated in the figure above, the data Bob signs include......
In essence, the entire transaction is signed except...
What Bob does not sign is the signature itself and signature script.
The signature not signed is logical. You cannot use pencil to draw on the same pencil.
The script not signed is also logical . When evil person changes script, transaction is no longer valid as it fails to unlock UTXO

Each transaction pays a small fee. Only transactions paying enough in fees become confirmed. The space in block is limited to about 2500 transactions. This means Bitcoin can confirm about 2500 transactions per 10 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:53:49
When someone sends you 0.01 BTC using one transaction then you own a whole coin (whole unspend transaction output) worth 0.01 BTC. You can imagine that this is a whole coin that you own.
If you then pay to two people 0.005 BTC each, the 0.01 coin is destroyed and two new coins (transaction outputs) are created, 0.005 BTC each. These are two different whole coins.

Be careful, sending coins to burn address with a valid checksum works also on the gui.
If you need to experiment, use the testnet.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:05:31
The idea is that the contract n lock time goes in large steps, for example 24 hour steps at a time. But the initial lock is huge let's say 200 days. So it is assumed that the period of maybe 150 days (after 50 changes to contract) is long enough for Alice to reconnect to the internet and propagate it during the next 150 days.
Second bullet point, the transaction has to be signed by both participants so Bob cannot unilateraly overwrite Alice's part of the contract. (each participant must sign both tranasctions -halves of the contract)
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:32:52
Last 6 characters are checksum. the wallet will check the checksum and find the address is invalid
However if you fake the checksum, example:
    1 F o r e v e r 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 R M w C B
If you pay here , yes it will be sent and the funds will be lost forever. It's called a burn address, the cash is burned.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:51:22
The problem is, if the block size raises to 100 MB or to 1000 MB, a common individuals will no longer able to run full nodes. Because it would take ages to synchronize on a slow connection.
But miners can easily game your suggestion and mine only 100 KB blocks (fill the rest with spam or leave it empty.)
Mining only 100KB blocks would cause the actual cap to increase forever (there are high fees so cap grows).
After a year the miners can suddenly start mining 1000 MB blocks (because cap is grown to 1000MB)
And suddenly, Bitcoin is unusable for average individual, only by people with fast internet connections.

It's naive to think that coins are to be valued by their usefulness. This is true of physical assets like television, computer, fridge. The more useful it is the more value in theory it should have, right? I agree.
Digital coins are different however. They have no physical manifestation of usefulness. It's only about the supply and demand.
To turn your question around: Anyone can create a fork of ethereum. And the truth is the fork of ethereum can overtake ethereum! Not only that, but simply due to the reason it was LATE. Being late implies that latecomers can turn profit.
Bitcoin is held in higher value than others due to it being unforkable and due to it being the original coin. Sure you may say Bcash is the fork of Bitcoin. However it is not the Nakamoto chain that went trough hardfork but the Bcash chain (emergency difficulty adjustment).
About Bitcoin being the original coin.. It is the coca cola of beverages.  It is the original and first blockchain. It is the kalashnikov of rifles. Sure previous designs existed, but there is no widely accepted proof that the previous designs actually worked. In fact Bitcoin itself IS THE PROOF that Bitcoin was first, and carries the message it was made after 03/Jan/2009. If any prior coin existed, it would carry the proof simply by having longer (older genesis) blockchain.

The idea is that the shills willing to flood the network select a small fee, let's say $0.01 per transaction.

Don't throw away the usb disk. Be very careful with the usb disk. Don't fear, your coins can be saved.
Get a hiren boot cd and burn it on CD. Start hiren boot cd. Use partimage program to create a backup of your usb. 
next use dd to copy whole usb to a file. Use strings, grep program to look for your private key.
If it don't work because USB is damaged:
Go to shop where you buy the USB and buy same USB. (Same brand type and same producer and size 8gb)

No, all transactions are available forever, so that any new person to bitcoin can verify by their own eyes that all transactions ever made were spent by the real owner, and no Bitcoin rule was violated.
Yes it could become problem, for the unnamed altcoin, that blocks will be always full, first of all they claim that given the same popularity as Bitcoin the fees will not be high (they would). Secondly they cannot distinguish spam from actual payments so they will not know when exactly to raise blocksize to avoid fees.
Third their blockchain will become big of many Terabytes , and only people with the memory can mine or run a full node.

SPV mining is a Simplified Payment Verification mining. It is a risky form of mining that is however necessary to be done in practice.
It means that the miner of the current block actualy did not verify all the transactions in the previous block. In fact it did not  even check a single transaction from the previous block!
The next miner simply believes that no previous miner would be so foolish to actually mine a block with invalid transactions in it.
If the previous miner is evil, not only his block becomes invalid, but also the current miner's block becomes invalid. Thus a two blocks deep reorganization would occur.

no, the Block is hashed and the hash is hashed. This is used by Nakamoto to make SHA even more robust (secure) than it is. There are 4.3 billion possible resulting double hashes


The modern ASIC is so powerful that it just grinds through the 4.3 billion possibilities in seconds just like that. What happens once  nonce reaches 0xFFFFFFFF, it changes to 0 again and extra nonce is incremented. Extra nonce can be found in coinbase transaction (where Satoshi wrote the bailouts message). This means that merkle root changes and thus the ASIC has several more seconds of work to do :-)

@_date: 2017-12-27 20:22:01
The miners can game your theoretical system by artificially mining only high fee transactions and thus raise the cap arbitrarily high. There is also the risk that the fees dropping beyond average would pathologically shrink the cap to a very low size.
The only thing that would actually work is fixed cap (the one that Nakamoto added in version 0.3.13 of Bitcoin)
The only other option is to grow the cap over time by a fixed amount per time, say 1MB cap in 2017, 2MB cap in 2018, 3MB cap in 2019 and so on.. and do it automatically so that no single individual is in charge of deciding the cap...

Nothing at stake problem. In practice most proof of stake systems works in this way: There is an individual or a group of individuals who sign transactions, we call these signers.
Once signers approve (sign) a transaction, it is considered to be confirmed and the merchant can trust the funds are his. At this point (when the event of approval occurs) the merchant gives away goods to the customer.
Signers can trick a merchant to give away goods without getting paid as follows, using double approved double-spend.
Signer Alice makes a transaction paying 100 $ to merchant for goods. Signer Alice also makes a transaction paying 100 $ back to self.
Signer Alice approves first the transaction paying to the merchant and thus event of approval occurs. Merchant gives hands over the goods to Alice.
Alice now approves the second transaction paying the same 100$ back to self. This transaction is delivered to the whole world.
Finally, signers in general freeze the 100$ merchant received, claiming that the transaction paying to merchant never occurred.
Alice now has both goods and her 100$

* yes, once you run out of funds you need to top it up. this is typically done by paying an altcoin to anybody on the Bitcoin lightning network, and they send you Bitcoin lightning coins using your channel.
* it is active for the duration specified when the channel was opened, or if you jointly close it
* Lightning channel is controlled by the two participants who opened it.

Each Bitcoin transaction has inputs and outputs. Inputs are basically which Bitcoins were spent + signature of the spender. Outputs are the addresses where the coins are sent. 
For example a transaction with one input of 1Bitcoin and two outputs of 0.5 and 0.49 Bitcoins is used to pay from someone holding 1Bitcoin to someone demanding 0.5Bitcoin , and 0.49 Bitcoin is sent as change back to the spender.
In this case the missing amount is the 0.01 Bitcoin fee. This goes to the miners.
However a coinbase transaction is special, because it has no inputs. For example 0 Bitcoin was send by nobody, and mining pool received 12.5Bitcoin + the 0.01 Bitcoin fee. 
It's literally Bitcoins created from thin air.

block header + transactions =  Bitcoin block
yes to be precise hashing uses whole block header as input. Block header has 80 bytes. It contains network version, the hash of the previous block, "merkle root" - this is where all transactions are contained, current time, the current difficulty, and a nonce - number that increases after every hash calculation.
The goal is simply to find the correct nonce. The machine calculates the hash, looks at the zeroes, increments the nonce and calculates the next hash, and so on

Current difficulty is 18 zeroes. Recently this block was mined:
Check the zeroes at the beginning. This proves that too much electricity got wasted mining for the block. When difficulty goes up , to 19 zeroes for example, is it 16x harder to find a block.


Yes. What changes is the amount of zeroes the miners are searching for.


Every 2016 blocks. All nodes on the network say, hey it took this long to mine the 2016 blocks, and adjust the difficulty accordingly (the blocks contain time when they were mined). 
Once the difficulty goes down, all nodes start accepting blocks with less zeroes in the beginning.
Once the difficulty goes up, all nodes start considering blocks with not enough zeroes as invalid.

Double spend, or doublespend is activity possible in every payment system.
In cash it is equivalent to counterfeiting cash, you copy a banknote or a coin, including the serial number, then you pay using the original+copied.
In electronic banking, when you pay quickly at the same time to two different accounts, what happens the system should detect the double spend, and only one of the two payments gets confirmed, the other payment gets revoked.
This is same in Bitcoin. Bitcoin miners confirm transactions, meaning that the more confirmations a payment has, the more receiver can be assured that funds obtained are really his/hers.
Doublespends in Bitcoin however are not confirmed. This means the attacker is unable to counterfeit the Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:05:38
The fees are a parameter necessary for the long term survival of the coin. It is about mining, the miners need an incentive to mine the coins other than the subsidy (because the subsidy-supply drops to simulate digital gold rarity).  Nakamoto designed a system where the miners over time move on to dig for the fees instead.
Another reason to have fees is to solve the fixed capacity problem. A coin cannot have unlimited capacity due to real world computers limitations and the slow networking speeds some of the coin users have. Users bid using fees and only  those transactions paying the highest fees are processed.
It's possible to have a coin with constant supply (see Dogecoin) however such a coin would not simulate digital gold rarity due to ever growing monetary base. Such a coin would need no fees.

The more zeroes in the beginning , the harder is do discover the solutions.

Other such valuation is the current market price.
Then there is true value. If you consider that Bitcoin production will be halved every 4 years, then the logical conclusion that the price must double every 4 year (assuming unchanged demand). When we consider that it grow faster than that-in the past- its only natural to consider that the growth will continue) .

They didn't study the rate of SPV mining.
The decentralization is also not correctly studied. Decentralization is not the number of properly functioning nodes in the peer-to-peer overlay network.
Decentralization is the rate of unreachability of adversary exploitable vulnerabilities. It's the absence of single points of failure.
It is not correct to raise the cap before all other much more fundamental approaches like Lightning network were tried.
Once we have Lightning network operational we can learn exactly how much capacity is actually needed while keeping the network robust and decentralized.
When the consensus is reached how much kilobytes the cap needs to grow per year, we can finally put this issue to rest for eternity.

The actual cash notes would be worth less than their face value as measured in Bitcoin.
The 1Bitcoin note for example, would be worth let's say 0.9 Bitcoin. The ratio I call the faith factor. It's the faith one has to have that  the note can be cashed out to actual Bitcoin. In my example, the faith factor is 90%. The faith is a number between 100% and 0%

Archive nodes are especially important, they ensue that once there are large scale network attacks, a backup of the blockchain exists and can be continued to be mined once the storm is over.
Full nodes with human operators are also a good idea, to manually inspect blocks as they are mined. Not only it is useful to verify the blocks meet the difficulty target but also to check the timestamps are up to date.
 It is only thanks to human operators that a major value overflow incident has been caught early and fixed.

Both ideas are good. Let me add, that perhaps opening channels with people who are trusted like relatives makes sense for very long periods of time.

Do the math. The mining rewards are currently 12.5 Bitcoin and 12.5 Bcash on bcash coin. But Bitcoin miners already today earn more than 9 Bitcoins per block from fees. Bcash miners however earn close to zero bcash from fees.
Total revenues today are 21.5 Bitcoin vs. 12.5 Bcash. Multiply each coin with it's price and you see miners of what coin earn more dollars.
All Bitcoin variants have halving every 4 years. This means that in year 2020 rewards decrease to 6.25 Bitcoin and bcash respectively. However by that time the real Bitcoin miners will be earning more than 20 Bitcoin including fees while the bcash miners will be earning 6.25 Bcash (the frees simply won't be there.)
Guess which coin is gonna survive and which gonna struggle for it's life. Bitcoin is the mother fucking honeybadger it just won't stay dead.

I agree.
The channels expire eventually due to timelock, so reopening a larger one eventually makes sense.
There is another solution and that's divide and conquer, you split a largish payment the receiver cannot swallow into a several smaller payments, and the receiver spends it on something in between.
The thing is at least in the beginning the channels are going to use small amounts, until the lightning code is fully battle tested.

 Harald Vranken, associate professor at Netherlands' Open University, studied the energy draw of bitcoin earlier this year, positing that it was in the 100MW to 500MW range, versus Digiconomist's 3.4GW. "At first glance, it appears that these are quite different figures, however this is not the case," Vranken says, because when it comes to bitcoin, numbers that are an order of magnitude apart are actually kind of the same.
As he explained to WIRED, his numbers are for January of this year and since then the network hash rate — a measure of the bitcoin network's processing power, looking at how quickly it solves the equations that run the network — has leapt by a factor of 4.2. The revenue from mining in January was $716 million, while now it's $8 billion — a factor of 11.4. Feed those factors into Vranken’s equation and bitcoin’s energy draw is between 5GW and 7GW. That's more than Digiconomist's figure, but that methodology has other inputs. "Digiconomist furthermore considers that miners nowadays spend 60 per cent of their revenues on operational costs, which would mean that my figures now would be 3GW to 4.3 GW," he says, adding that means the Digiconomist figure "is in line with my figures."
So while those two figures look different, they're roughly the same. What a difference a year makes.

It's the most secure coin by a large margin. By security I mean the capability to prevent Doublespend fraud, and impossibility of freezing funds.
Secondly , about scalability , Bitcoin is more scalable than most altcoins (even if their authors/supporters claim otherwise). The 1MB cap, introduced by Nakamoto, is not a scalability issue but is a direct result of the major desire for maximal security.
Processing time is not an issue if you pay high fees, see below.
Next, the fees are not nearly the issue they are claimed to be. They are not a percentual of the transacted amount (like in banks, fiat payment systems). The fees are fixed per transaction size. This means you can send millions/ hundreds of dollars for the same fee.
Obviously this is a disadvantage that, small payments are not economical any more. This causes Bitcoin to turn into what I call store of value/digital gold.
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:31:10

@_date: 2017-12-29 09:56:48
Transaction consists of inputs and outputs. Input allows you to spend certain coin. Output is basically an address and the amount of Bitcoin send to a given address, thus creating a new coin.
Take this transaction for example:
Imagine you are Satoshi trying to move his coins. Satoshi owns a coin of 50 Bitcoins that he mined. 
Let's say you want to send 10 Bitcoin to Hal Finney
So Satoshi creates two outputs: One output sending 10 Bitcoin to Hal Finney and second output sending 40 Bitcoin change back to Satoshi. 
Satoshi also created one input spending the 50 Bitcoins coin.
Thus the transaction has 1 Input and 2 Outputs. The more inputs + outputs the larger the transaction is.

There is a large group of believers who disagree with the removing of the 1Mb cap added by Satoshi Nakamoto to version 0.3.13 of Bitcoin and that existed ever since.
It is considered one of the main network rules of Bitcoin network, one that will enable the transition to the fee market.
Once the majority of the income made by miners is from transaction fees, this means that the coin will not only survive, but stay profitable to mine for  centuries to come.
Sure we may not live that long, but the future generations will be thankful for a coin that not only survived but also thrived and appreciated in value, unlike some other coins like bcash that are destined for a failure.

In short, they wouldn't.
In long let me explain to you how it's gonna work. Nobody lends a homeless in the current system either. One of Bitcoin's main purpose, is taxation bypass, it works like this. You "borrow" from someone cash (on the books), but you give them Bitcoin (off the books). You then repaying the loan (on the books), but actually purchasing Bitcoin back (off the books).
From the perspective of the state it looks like someone simply borrowed from somebody who believes in them repaying. However state encourages such a "altruistic" behavior (for whatever reasons), for this reason it's not taxed heavily, if at all.
What actually happened is simply a plain old fair Bitcoin trading, masqueraded as lending.
In a world with fiat, and cryptocoins, there are forever opportunities of this kind, to essentially screw over people in power who are trying to screw over with you in the first place (printing cash from thin air, bailouts, taxation etc..)

Of course the fees will go down once we have Lightning, because recurring payments migrate to Lightning, making main network usable again for one-shot payments.
The bubble won't pop purely for the reason that there is no bubble. A massive price growth happened several times over the history of Bitcoin, and followed by corrections as usual. Thing is this is the fair price of coin, and it is not far away from the intrinsic value (the cost of mining one Bitcoin).

To the exchange itself. When you create a B-cash address on exchange, the exchange is waiting for b-cash coins to arrive to said address, but not Bitcoins. For this reason, the arriving Bitcoins end up in the collective wallet but not credited to anybody.
An engineer needs pick up the coins manually, and credit them to your account manually.
You should very politely tell Coinbase that you did a grave mistake of sending the wrong coins to the wrong address, and ask them if they are or not are going to credit the coins to you.
If not, the wrongly transacted coins are either lost or become the property of the exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:40:41
Chiefly for privacy reasons. An unaware observer is not able to tell which output is the change output. For example, Satoshi might sent those 40 BTC to Hal and 10 BTC to self or 40 BTC to self and 10 BTC to Hal.
Another reason why change exists is that you have to spend a whole coin (whole output) every time.
For example Bitcoin is not an account system. Transaction is not a thing that subtracts the 10BTC amount from one account (from the sender) and adds 10BTC to the receiver. This is not how it works.
In the future Bitcoin might migrate to qunatum proof one-time signatures, this is another reason why a whole coin has to be spent every time an output is spent.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:47:57
About the first thing. If rational economic actors notice that something's below it's production cost and it is limited, they would hoard it until all "discounted items" are purchased. This means the price bumps back above the production cost. This is the price floor theory that there exist price below which Bitcoin cannot drop no matter what.

Once Bitcoin consumes whole percents (1%, 2%) of total electricity produced by mankind, we will see an interesting weighting event happening on the market. People realize that mining equipment is universally available, but souces of power aren't. This would be the event when the intrinsic price of Bitcoin becomes anchored in physical realities and to the actual distribution of power sources worldwide. It would mean that no longer "anyone" can become a miner. Once this happens people realize that one does not simply mine bitcoin, one has to purchase it for premium. This would mark the beginning of a monumental bull market. We would fly past 100 000$ per coin, whooosh, just like that.

It's not that the fees are bullshit, the fees are simply fixed amount per transaction no matter the transaction amount. Over time the equilibrium will be found where people use Bitcoins for large amount transactions, the low net worth individuals move on to lightning micropayment networks.
In the fiat world it's the opposite. The fees are typically percentage of the transacted amount. The reason is the larger the amount the more security you need, more real guys with guns and armored vehicles etc.
This is why fiat does not scale. You simply can't walk around with a rucksack full of 1 Billion worth of usd. Satoshi can.

Consider the coins lost for now. BTC addresses only wait for BTC coins to arrive, while BCH addresses only wait for BCH coins to arrive. What happened, the coins arrived to a collective wallet at Coinbase, but they were not credited to you.
What you should do, is to contact Coinbase and apologize for making a grave mistake, and ask them politely if  to pick up the coins and assign them to you. Don't forget to provide the details so they can investigate the issue.
If they don't, the coins are lost forever or end up being the property of the exchange.

In short: Malleability allows you to create an invalid refund transaction and hold the party funding the channel hostage.
Yes the changing the hash of transaction arbitrarily is the root of problem for LN usage.
As you probably know, inputs in successive transactions refer to the hash of previous transaction, and the numeric ID of the ouptut they spend.
In LN usage the LN user don't actually own Bitcoin on chain. The LN user simply holds one of two successive transactions, signed by both parties.
The way to do this is to have a reliable spend of an unconfirmed transaction. Reliable spend of an unconfirmed tx is needed to close the channel. Remember that the two participants simply sign a pair an unconfirmed transactions I have 1 BTC you have 0.5 BTC. The way they send funds is signing off another pair of unconfirmed transactions I have 0.9 BTC you have 0.6 BTC, with a lower timelock.
But to close the channel cooperatively, they need to reliably sign another unconfirmed transaction that spends the in-flight unconfirmed transaction

The optimal level of decentralization is reached once the vulnerabilities of the system are out of reach of adversaries and thus cannot be exploited. In the case of Bitcoin, there is only one meaningful vulnerability we can speak about: the signs of exploitation of the 51% attack itself.
This is why the system can be considered fully decentralized even in the scenario of just two entities with close to 50% hashrate, when none of the entities is capable to gain the majority for some reason. The reason most likely has to do something in common with the physical security and secrecy of the locations of the mining farms.
Currently Bitcoin seems much more decentralized than that.
Another important aspect is the decentralization of the validation nodes. There must be a low to none barrier to entry to become a validator / archive node. Everyone in the world must be able to check on their very own eyes that all rules of the system are followed.

1. it is assumed that you open channels to people you trust. If everyone in the world opens a channel to 6 best friends we get a global network where you can pay prettymuch anyone in the world any amount instantly. best friends aren't going to screw each other by forcing channel closes and refunds to their best friends, just to force delay on their counterparty, they  forced the same delay upon themself (just to get 5$ by reversing the most recent 5$ update).
2. this fee attack won't work because the transaction with more fees cannot be added to blockchain due to timelock expiring one timestep later (24 hours in my scenario)

Ethereum blocks come every few seconds. Ethereum has magnitudes less mining power behind it. These two facts mean that it is fairly easy for a large pool or malicious actor to orphan a block, or even 6 blocks.
This makes it vulnerable to double spend attacks.
If this were to happen, you as a merchant would give out the goods, in the belief that your Ethereums are yours only to observe the confirmations to disappear and your funds gone.
Furthermore, since Ethereum hash power is kind of small (compared to Bitcoin), it is susceptible to 51% spend attacks.

@_date: 2017-12-19 21:45:54
yes if you have the chance it's a good idea to create large capacity channels.
for example exchange funds 0.3 BTC and you fund with 0.001 BTC then you have good capacity of 0.301 Bitcoin-  however the exchange channel will probably have larger fees because their bitcoin will be stuck in your channel for years or longer.
then you can for example open a channel with best friend, fund 0.1 Btc each (0.2 Btc capacity)
In this scenario, the maximum you can own on lightning at any given point in time would be 0.501 Bitcoin (total capacity)
The payments trough the friend will be cheaper , as he is also sending thru you his different payments so whatever you pay to friend for your payments will be eventually return as he will be paying thru you also and paying you fees for his payments.

In theory, if you were a miner, you could mine a transaction with too many outputs, in fact as large as 1MB transaction.

The whole history since 2009 is recorded for the reason that anytime anyone could make a transaction going to arbitrary address. To know final balances as of today, the whole history must be validated.
The advantage is that there is no trust needed. You not need to believe that "John owns 0.564  BTC", you can check that for yourself that alice paid John 0.564, which in turn were send by sue to alice in 2013 and so on until the point when the coin was mined. 
The disadvantage is that the history is kind of big (160GB as of today iirc)
There exist cryptocurrency blueprints "ideas" that can be used to shrink the history. It is called Mimblewimble, invented by an anonymous author by the name "Tom Elvis Jedusor" in 2016 
However no coin as of today uses Mimblewimble. Actually there is one coin, named Grin , they are running a test network of the idea.

Segwit does not allow you to send 5 bucks for a really low fee. Segwit allows you to send a smaller transaction and thus reduce the fee by a several percent.
The steps are: use your wallet to create a segwit pay to script hash address, one that begins with 3. Once you have some funds on your address you are able to send a segwit transaction. Any transaction sent from a segwit address is a segwit transaction.

yes but what is signed by Alice is not the previous transaction, but she is signing the txid of the new transaction (excluding the signature - signature cannot sign the signature)

Bitcoin tokens themselves represent and in effect are a packaged wasted electricity. This electricity has value (an opportunity value at minimum - the electricity could in effect be spent for something else) but that is not my point. 
My point is you are completely wrong and naive.

of course , you can put the merkle roots into op_return bitcoin transactions, to arbitrarily large data. This way you can prove that piece of data must have existed at a certain time (but not much more).
But then a malicious actor can trivially submit fake data about asset states. This means that real actor records data that insured property damage is 100 000$ and the fake actor can trivially record that insured property damage is 1$. The bitcoin network will never verify either claim as actual, only thing you  can do is to prove that the data (both the actual and fake version) existed.

Please note that core is mostly intended for people who mean bitcoin seriously, not for people who just want pay once.
I think your best bet it to let your coins sit there until you figure out a fast internet connection where you can let your computer synchronize for a few days.
Once core is synchronized you can spend your coin.
Alternative method is to get external disc, go to a bitcoiner, or someone who has fast internet, install core there, he will copy to you the 150GB to your disc. At home you then copy the index and chainstate folders to your core, it then synchronizes quickly and you will be able to spend your funds.

You top-up and create a channel with anyone who is already connected to the network.
Then you can pay using that channel to anyone on the network, provided that the channel capacity is not exceeded. This means for example you open 0.5 BTC channel and the counterparty submits 0.5BTC, this will allow you to send maximum of 1 Bitcoin to anyone on the network. Once you spend everything you need to top-up again.

Miners take unconfirmed transactions, put them into a block and then mine the block.
Mining means repeatedly encrypting the block with sha256 (bazillion of times). But after every attempt the machine looks at the sha256 result to see how many zeroes are there at the beginning.
Once there are 000000000000000000 zeroes the block is effectively locked and anything inside (the transactions) cannot be changed anymore. This frozen (solved) block is then immediately sent to everyone on the network including other miners and users.
And so the miners begin to solve the next block.

This is where you're mistaken. If the person paying to you does another transaction paying the same coin back to themselves. The attacker collects the goods you give out and subsequently mines the pay-to-self transaction into a block.
You as a merchant are left without goods and without Bitcoins. The 0/unconfirmed transaction simply disappears from your wallet.

you can currently split Bitcoin to Satoshis, the smallest unit currently is 0.00000001 BTC. It is hardcoded into transaction format and into the consensus. This means that everyone on the network needs to agree on the change to introduce smaller sub-Satoshi units. The need for this would not come earlier than year 2100, when 1 Satoshi would be a decent sum of money.
Current block reward is 12.5 Bitcoins. In year 2140 the miners reward will be one satoshi and will drop to 0 satoshi. It is expected that by this time 1 satoshi would be a lot of money and people would by then already agree to use smaller units.

What datasets? The sets of more transactions? How is that different from simply putting more transactions into the one merkle root there already is.
 You are right, there is a risk of discrepancies. In fact if the miners of the main coin don't understand or don't care about the rules of the private blockchain, they can simply put a random number instead of that private chain merkle root, and the private chain users never gonna learn what data was ever put there.

to answer your question, every machine encrypts different piece of information, because they have different address that pays to the miner.
So for example john's machine encrypts:
    Pay john 12.5 BTC attempt 1 ..... 5f99f10af89406f4d455f99f10af89406f4d45
    Pay john 12.5 BTC attempt 2 ..... 4b161af0c8a675477b38a4b161af0c8a675
    Pay john 12.5 BTC attempt 3 ..... 5764b1615764b1615764b1615764b16154
Meanwhile bobs machine encrypts:
    Pay bob 12.5 BTC attempt 1 ..... 16a9ec6837a773d4fb714dd90220bf61f
    Pay bob 12.5 BTC attempt 2 ..... 764b161af0c8a675477b3d4fb714dd98a
    Pay bob 12.5 BTC attempt 3 ....  0000000000000000000570575477b3d4f
In this example bob solved a block on third attempt. Yes it is true that a faster machine has a bigger chance to win, but in the end, it's random and even the slower machine has some chance to win.

Each time the network rules change, there is a risk of a certain users disagreeing and thus performing hard fork.
Fortunately, network rules change is rarely needed, Bitcoin is well engineered, and can run for decades without a rules change.
There is a not-well-know way to prevent hard fork, but it requires the cooperation of currency holders (whales not needed, it can be a lots of ordinary holders too). It is named user activated nuke transactions. Basically major holders nuke the weak chain, by paying their weak chain coins to majority chain miners addresses.
It is thought a rational miner, who believes that the weak chain coin are the real coins, would ironically mine on the main chain, for the reason that he obtains more weak chain coins in this way.

Let me present to you a theory. Mining is by definition the cheapest way to obtain Bitcoin. So when the price nears the price floor, everyone knows it's the price floor, and everyone tries to get cheap bitcoin (to resell later once we are above the price floor). Because mining is the cheapest way to get Bitcoin everyone starts mining. And so infinity of miners joins the network, the difficulty of mining skyrockets, and so does the value (price) of Bitcoin.
This is how bouncing off the price floor works. Flaws?

It is called a naive double spend attack. The success rate depends of how much Bitcoin computing power the "average Joe" (attacker) holds and how many times he shops.
For example Joe holding 1% of computing power, the success rate on single shopping is about 1%.
If the joe is able to shop unlimited times, he will eventually (with 100% probability) mine the block and thus scam the merchant.
But there is even worse attack possible, and that is combined sybil attack + double spend attack. This has 100% probability to succeed and it's not very complex.
Attacker shops. Upon receiving the goods, he propagates the pay-coin-to-self transaction on the real Bitcoin network. After doing that, he sends the pay-to-merchant transaction to the merchant. Since the merchant is cut off from the real Bitcoin network (under sybil attack), the merchant never learns the coin is also being spend back to an attacker's pocket. The attacker then leaves the premises.
Eventually the block is mined with the pay-to self transaction. The pay to merchant transaction never confirms (stays at 0/unconfirmed forever).

Money is any item or *verifiable record* that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a particular country or socio-economic context.
It has 3 roles: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and sometimes standard of deferred payment.
Medium of exchange is the communication medium also known as the Bitcoin main network. There are two units of account Bitcoin and 1 Satoshi (the smallest undivisible unit of account).
The store of value aspect is up to debate, but even naysayers admit that Bitcoin stores value somehow, this means the unit of account of the currency does not drop to zero value overnight.
Commodity on the other hand is an economic good or service that has full or substantial fungibility. Most commodities are raw materials, basic resources, or agricultural products, such as iron ore, sugar, or rice. In my opinion Bitcoin does not belong to this category, but whatever.

Your hypothesis is that the price floor would drop together with the dropping price. However that depends on unprofitable miners closing shops. If they stay but hoard coins instead they can survive it and once the believers buy back the price is skyrocketing again never breaching the floor in the first place.

Yes it would. It is expected that either Bitcoin would be massively valuable and thus useful, making the fees astronomic.
The other option Bitcoin goes away and other coins take its place. What happens depends on the people who are alive in year 2140 or so when the subsidy drops to zero.

yes when sending BTC from a wallet you control., you are free to pick an arbitrary fee

if you hold bitcoin private keys then you will immediately once the fork occurs be able to transact on both chains (with both currencies). you will be able to do it knowingly but also unknowingly, by spending a Bitcoin the S2x coin can move too as if the coins were glued together. To separate the coins one needs to do two way split their Bitcoin.

* they can mine all the remaining subsidy+fees and prevent others to do so
they can't
* can't reverse other people's transactions without their cooperation
* can't censor transactions ( they still get delivered but are unconfirmed )
* can't change consensus parameters like the total amount (21 million coins) etc

the subsidy halvings have an effect on the supply-it is halved. one possible consequence is that the price is supposed to double if the demand stays constant. if this is true then bitcoin is going to grow at exponential rate. doubling every 4 years,
this means that bitcoin price expressed in terms of fiat is never gonna stabilise and always gonna grow. literally to the moon.

1. no. you can mine coins and pay for electricity or simply buy coins
3. can't buy that much coins, since we all here don't own that much.
3. if it happened, it is more likely there was thousands of different transactions owned by the 3 million buyer

First of all don't buy small amount like 1$, buy at least 50$ if you really want to own Bitcoin you need to move it to your own wallet, this means you need to pay the transaction fee that are on the level of cents like 0.5$ but can be as high as 4$.

what you describe is normal market dynamics. Pumps happen, Dump happen.
but please explain to me, how can the price drop below a certain level I call the "price floor".
If it takes 500$ to mine one Bitcoin with a 0.05$ kWh electricity in China, how can in your teory Bitcoin crash below 500$?

When you are the sendor you can set the fee to arbitrary.
When exchange is the sendor they set the fee for you.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:05:20
how exactly can mining become unprofitable? There are users who steal electricity, these individuals would mine no matter what price. On the other end of the spectrum we have miners in developed economies (expensive power), they would simply go out of business, making the difficulty drop for the ones who keep mining. So the network will remain operational no matter what.
Once rational actors see that Bitcoin is below it's production cost, they will purchase as much as they can (a bargain hypothesis).
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:36:53

Satoshi nakamoto determined in 2009 that the problem to be solved is "Double SHA256 below target"
The machines are searching for a block that when hashed results in a too many leading zeroes in the beginning.
Example of a solution, The block 496744 mined two minute ago when hashed results to the following number:
Notice the zeroes at the beggining. This means a lot of electricity has been spend to find the block.

Paypal is a company that uses clever methods to determine if a trade has been made in real life. They deal with trades of physical items mostly. It is to prevent sellers for delivering bricks to customers instead of the items they bought. They have a massive fraud prevention system. And this system often captures Bitcoin purchases as fraud.

we today can construct a coin that is resistant to quantum attack. only problem the signatures are kind of huge so the current Bitcoin is pretty efficient.
About quantum theft - yes Satoshi's coins would be stolen, so will any funds with revealed public key. Currently Bitcoin uses P2SH &amp; P2PKH and these are kind of quantum proof althought not completely.
It's also possible that quantum computers could be used to secure signatures, however this idea has not been researched a lot.

No. The buyer keypair is a fresh keypair created before payment.
Buyer then give public key to seller.
Seller then put the public key to payment. Payment = buyer public key + seller signature

no it's like paper claims system ( a gold certificates if you will)
you have a piece of paper that says you own 1 gold coin and there is an insitution that gives you said gold coin for the certificate
likewise in lightning you hold a transaction that says you own 0.3 BTC and your counterparty owns tx that says they have 0.7  BTC
now you "send" value simply by both issuing new transactions that you now have 0.2BTC and the counterparty that they have 0.8 BTC 
whenever  there is a disagreement about the ownership of the shared 1BTC, both (or one) owners send the latest valid contract to blockchain for confirmation. it confirms and the bitcoin are actually moved according to the latest agreement made by the two owners.

This changes one of the main Satoshi rules, that the block time shall be 10 minutes on average.
It is esentially a hard fork because for non-updated clients, suddenly blocks that were previously supposed to be valid aren't anymore (the 10 minute spaced blocks)
on the other hand there are 5 minute spaced blocks that were previously invalid, but under the new rules, they are valid.

   Is there ever a time when Bitcoins would be worthless
If it crashes thru the price floor. Please consider that users who steal electricity will mine no matter what = it is profitable at any price level.

what becomes tainted is a whole transaction (a theft transaction for example), when following the outputs of said transaction, the subsequent transactions are suspicious because they are probably made by the thief.
fungibility means you are unable to know which satoshi has been part of a theft once because when you send stolen funds to a fresh address and then you send clean funds there, and separate the whole (send to two outputs again) the funds are simply subtracted but you don't know which satoshi was stolen anymore

once you send the coin back to yourself it disappears from both wallets and then it arrives to wallet 2 only
if you prefer no fees use an altcoin like litecoin. however keep in mind that the assurance that your payment is final is lower than in the strongest coin Bitcoin.
use litecoin and wait for 30 confirmations will get you similar assurance like wait for 6 confirmations on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:43:57

3. When you send a transactions with too low fees, it stays in the mempool of most full nodes (1) until it either expires…
Surprise, even the word “expires” needs an explanation.
Since Bitcoin Core 0.12 there is an expiration time of 72 hours. This is what I meant by, when I said “your coins reappear in your wallet after 3 days“.
But this is not the whole story. This expiration time can vary between node implementation, or even completely missing. In fact, even in Core you can set the -mempoolexpiry setting.
But, and it’s still not all: anyone can rebroadcast that transaction, and so bypass this expiration.
I wonder if an attack would work when you setup a node and keep rebroadcasting all low-fee transactions until the end of times.
In the bigger context, it is unlikely your transaction won’t expire after 72 hours, so you don’t have to deal with it, but it’s something nice to keep in mind.
4. When you send a transactions with too low fees, it stays in the mempool of most full nodes (1) until it either expires, (2) until a miner picks it up and confirms in a block or (3) until some magic makes (1) or (2) happen.
Magic? I know what you’re thinking. Another overcomplicated technical term. Let’s see what that means:

example: 10 halong dragon miners
160 TH/s
14 800 Watt consumption
generates 2.74 Bitcoins per year
consumes electricity worth 129 650 KWh per year.
at 0.06 $/kWh this is 7779$
capital cost
the miners cost $15 950 
housing cost is maybe 100$ per year
human labour 3000$ per year
total costs:
26829$ / 2.74 Bitcoins = 9791.6 $ per Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-16 18:44:03
target in Bitcoin is adjusted every 2 weeks (more exactly every 2016 blocks)
the exact target depends on the time when the last (2016th) block gets mined.
when it adjusts up (the difficulty drops) suddenly some blocks that would be invalid can be valid
when it adjusts down (the difficulty climbs) some blocks that were valid under the old target can become invalid (not under the new target)
so you can search solution for future target, but that solution would only be valid if difficulty stayed or dropped.
what prevents you from searching future solutions, is the previous block field. You have to enter the hash of previous block here. This means you cannot really mine for future solutions, only the next immediate solution.

@_date: 2018-07-09 20:27:37
Yes but the price in reality is lower,
the main factor in the example is the miners machines price.
The machines probably don't die after a year, you can continue mining or sell them. So in reality I believe you would be in profit with 0.06 $/kWh power cost.

Let me answer you. It's usually not because a country (actually users from the country) is vulnerable to cyber attack. Its because some Bitcoin / crypto company wants to exclude certain country. The reason is usually law, ban. This means for example some country for instance China bans ICO's, this means the ICO company for example EOS bans china users to participate in the ICO. Otherwise China police can raid the ICO company and put the employees in jail.
