As far as my understanding of BTC mining goes (I haven't mined any cryptos myself, but did seriously look into it a bit) the hashing power would have to be extremely high to eventually turn a profit, especially with BTC, even if the appliances were connected to a mining pool. They'd be better off choosing an altcoin for the appliances to mine. It will be interesting to see if this happens since the article also mentioned several other companies dabbling with this idea in the past.

Oh that's a guarantee, it's only a matter of time. The SDR is most likely going to replace the dollar as the next global reserve currency, and when that does, hello hyperinflation in the US. Glad I'm investing in cryptos and precious metals while I still can... Hoping we still have some time for the elites to keep kicking that can down the road, but with the petrodollar fading as quickly as it is now, I don't know if we will even have 10 more years of the USD being the global reserve currency.

Thank you OP for correcting the original image from "money" to "fiat". The USD is not "money", no fiat currency is "money." Money and currency are two different things!! Fiat is currency. Money is a store of value, which obviously fiat is not. 
My OCD was very pleased by this subtlety lol.

Unless it spent any time in direct sunlight. UV kills everything bacteria/virus wise as far as I know.

Only governments currently hold SDRs, "civilians" can't hold them yet. They've been around since the first issuance back in the 70s I believe it was. There are tons of economic articles on the progression towards the SDR possibly becoming the next reserve currency. It's not a guarantee yet, just what most economists are saying is most likely to happen based on recent economic events and government planning that has happened in the last few years. China being added to the basket of SDRs was huge. I recommend looking up a few of the articles online, just search SDR as new reserve currency" and read a few different ones because people are looking at it from the same general macro sense but the micro details change based on opinions and worldviews so that will give you a more broad sense of the general movement towards it instead of just one or two people's opinions. One thing I have seen come up more and more often is to partically asset back the SDR to help create stability since all the currencies in the basket are 100% fiat.

Been looking for this myself. Investment taxes make sense, but info on the tax implications of spending crypto for goods/services is nowhere to be found. 
I'm in the US, and there's absolutely nothing about cryptocurrencies in general on the IRS website. No surprise, but you'd think they'd at least mention them by now... I also asked the support team of Monaco (coming out with a debit card) what the tax implications would be and they told me to ask a CPA... I don't know if many CPA's are even familiar with crypto yet, but I'm not looking to spend hundreds of dollars asking dozens of CPA's for advise or their time to try to figure this out. 
Following to hopefully get some answers as well.

There isn't one yet. Maybe just use ���� (rocket to the moon!) see what I did there? lol there's nothing even close in the emoji list... not on iPhone at least. 
Even bitmoji is lacking... "money" was the only search world that I could get to pull up any currency related results. (Can't get it to attach here though)

Don't beat yourself up too bad, you are not alone.. I bought ETH at $50, watched it hit $400, then finally decided to sell the dip since it had been going for several weeks at $180, it hit $135 that same day and immediately climbed back above $200, so I missed the window to get back in too. Ended up transferring the money over to some LTC and am hoping to trade the currency pair for some cheaper ETH than a ETH-USD pair.... hopefully.... if it his $250 before by buy limit on LTC-ETH hits I'll just buy ETH though the pair at market and take the loss, since I doubt it's going below $180 again.... 
With BTC climbing again I'd buy at market no later than Aug 1 depending on the volatility swings. You may end up taking a loss, but it will climb again and your loss (and mine) will be made up in new profits eventually. 
I recently read that over 250,000 retailers are going to start accepting cryptocurrencies this summer, so an upswing is practically guaranteed at one point. I'm betting it hits $3k again here soon, possibly within the month.
