You could have leverage traded and lost it all besides your initial investment. This is quite neutral too.

It's so expensive because banks around the world are inflating the currencies in unison, loans are cheap, there are many speculators. Shits about to crash hard.. And if you're not out of worthless assets and legacy currency you might as well miss your hard earned $$ caio mein man. And this will be months from now, as you can tell bitcoin is going to not the moon, but the other side of the galaxy in USD terms. Check out Mike Maloney on YouTube for a start.

There may be another bounce, forget QCX and go to Bitstamp (even for canada) for better rates, service, more liquidity etc.. They are very quick with verification and bankwires as well. Act now and you may get your funds in before the next dip in a few days.

Think about it a little longer, your right to get out of a government owned currency (it always devalues) but investigate where bitcoin may go in the next while, get to know it intimately if you want invest a really large sum. Otherwise your still making an uneducated gamble. It's easy to lose money, harder to gain back. Especially if you have to start from scratch again. Currency and money alone never hold the same purchasing power as the day before, everything is an investment. Investing in your own business and skills holds the most value.

Correction, "entering into my first death-pledge at age 22". Good luck on your next gamble in the USD realty market.

Your risking it by keeping it in the bank for a future of hyperinflation. Its probably less risky to have it invested in cryptos (backed by software and upcoming confidence) than fiat (backed by fading confidence).
