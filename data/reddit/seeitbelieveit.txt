And those are all valid uses.
This really stems from trying to explain the price to family to get them involved.  I’ve tried explaining the ease of use and permissionless aspects that I’ve experienced among friends but these are people who’ve never had money issues where the bank told them they couldn’t access their money or had funds taken. And if I even try to get into the pros and cons of storing your own keys versus using an exchange it basically overwhelms them and the conversation goes no where.

I believe in the tech.  I just saw this “theory” posted in another sub and thought I’d ask. 
But something came up at Mother’s Day dinner yesterday where a relative felt they’d already “missed the boat” so to speak and that it was pretty expensive.  I wasn’t really sure how to counter that and justify giving currency investment advice at the dinner table.

Honestly I think the governments and old financial industry has no idea what's really happening in the crypto space.  By the time they understand the tech it'll be too late and dominance will be achieved.

So I understand blockchain as a cryptograically secure linked list that is resistant to being mutable. 
My question relates does that tech alone justify its price and the belief it’ll increase in value

What's crazy is I remember talking about a proto\-blockchain back in the 90s in a hacking channel on irc.  Someone was being introduced to hashing by the channel and they were all can I hash a hash? Which of course you can. Then the next statement from that nickname was something along the lines of why don't we hash1\-\&gt;hash1\+data
I barely remember those days but distinctly remember this getting a very interesting reaction along the lines of "i think he's onto something"
Oh and of course that's where the linux kernel was introduced to me but that's about all I remember.

Thanks for adding to the discussion.  What uses do you see for the blockchain tech if not for making money?

I’m not directly selling them they’re always the ones who bring it up then somehow talk themselves out of it in about a span of about ten minutes.
I agree. There’s actually a lot of study in marketing about the phases of adoption in new technology and we’re definitely still in the early adopter phase.  Way past the guru phase.

Considering most price predictions I see are from chartists his answer seems just as legit as most of the others.

As for widespread use I think we face a marketing and education problem
For marketing it’s an issue of both the community giving a positive appearance and the banks who are in one breath shitting on bitcoin and the other filing patent applications for blockchain tech by the hundreds and buying bitcoin

See I’ve thought about that argument but buying fractions doesn’t affect the per unit pricing it’s the same rate whether it’s .5 for 500 or 1 for 1000 the rate is the same. And yes it’s cheap to get involved the amount of bitcoin purchased today for $100 is less than what could of been gotten two years ago.  From that stand point I have a hard time telling them well just buy .1 because to me their argument is the rate is to expensive not the cost to get involved.  My family except maybe my mom arent privy to the shady stuff banks do because she used to be an examiner. Of all my family members she’s the most interested. The big concern with her was handing over bank info to an exchange to do the purchase.

Since you don't seem to get it. Bitcoin came from essentially code ($0). Worth nothing, and in 9ish years have market cap of 157 billion dollars. Berkshire hathaway A was 7,100 dollars to buy in June 1, 1990 and has a market cap of 485.91 billion. Even in your example its only doubled in price where as bitcoin came from essentially nothing. Also, if we look at the first 9 years of BRK.A it was valued at ~71,500. I think you're having a hard time grasping the relative nature of these two assets.
