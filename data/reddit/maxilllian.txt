Yes I do, couple of them besides blockchain.info. You might be onto something here!
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:39:32
Yes it was there, I don't like this "notebook" look of Ubuntu thus I have always removed it and setup the old gnome panel. 
@_date: 2014-06-16 21:35:50
Haha that is a great idea, thank you ;) 
@_date: 2014-03-08 12:35:52
You didn't write down the seed? How did you wipe your drive and what platform are you on, Windows, Linux or OS X?
@_date: 2014-07-02 20:39:52
It was after, just couple of days ago.

I LOVE that guy, Fred Wilson! 
Loves to give Bitcoin, what a human being! 
Loves making his friends happy. 
Now that is truly a good person, you could also see his little smile when he said that, probably reminded him of a recent giveaway. 
Bitcoin is all about freedom and love for others. Making the world a better place :)

After this process you don't have *cold* wallet. The private key has been online or on an online device like your phone.
Better way is create multiple paper wallets on a secure offline device and use a new one each time you go through your method.
@_date: 2014-02-23 12:20:39
Done. It will be interesting to see the results.
Good luck with it.
@_date: 2014-07-29 00:18:37
Thanks for your information and help kinoshitajona, I've decided to not touch the offline wallet since there clearly is no need for it.
@_date: 2014-07-28 23:49:48
Thanks for the link!
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:38:44
Ok, thanks for the reply. 
I know the process of creating signed transaction and then broadcasting it online via the watch only wallet.
But I wonder, since the wallet has never been online, but I have sent my funds to it and it shows up in the Blockchain, will I be able to create the signed transaction offline since there are no funds in that wallet because it is offline? Say I want to send 2BTC somewhere but the wallet is empty offline.
@_date: 2014-01-24 10:34:35
Actually buying them with Icelandic currency is perfectly legal. I can buy  BTC with ISK. But buying $ to buy BTC, which is basically what you need to do is illegal.
@_date: 2014-06-04 15:52:33
Brilliant idea.
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:58:35
Mainly since Electrum is so easy to use. Also you get couple of addresses when you create a wallet and I divide my coins between them so they are not all in the same place. And with that setup it's easy to use the master public key and view all of the addresses at the same time from watch only wallet.
I also have another hot wallet with some change to spend so it's always easy for me to open up the watch only wallet from there.
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:14:12
Yes I agree with you, the possibilities are endless.
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:02:10
I have seen a couple of similar guides online. This one is relatively new and easy. [Link to pasetbin](
@_date: 2014-01-24 10:37:44
You are not allowed to buy dollars or any other currency from any bank unless you have a valid authorization from the Central Bank. You can buy them with your CC, but the Central Bank monitors the CC use so that is not suitable either. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:04:24
I have the seed on paper in secure location. Don't worry.
@_date: 2014-07-24 12:39:18
Any suspicious addons you have installed on Chrome?
@_date: 2014-07-28 23:31:37
WoW much goodness guys! 
Hope I can use the miles since I'm in Iceland!
@_date: 2014-11-19 16:30:54
Thought so too. Scanned my system, can't find nothing tough. And other QR-codes on other sites  or apps work fine.
@_date: 2014-07-02 12:33:20
Not that related but...
I created a blockchain.info wallet not so long ago using my Gmail account. No one except me knew. Two days later I began receiving phising email that looked like coming from blockchain.info. 
That was strange since nobody knew besides blockchain.info and Gmail and I am 97,5% sure my machine is not infected. How did the hacker know? Could someone inside Google have known? Not really asking just saying watch out. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 00:31:04
Thanks mate. Yes we do, plenty. 
Since we are behind currency controls we have to grow them ourselves ;)
@_date: 2014-06-30 00:37:29
I live in Iceland and since we live behind capital controls (because of the 2008 banking crisis) I am not allowed to buy foreign currency e.g. dollars or euros to buy bitcoin. We have no exchange so my only change is finding someone on Localbitcoins willing to sell. But then again since we are behind capital controls those selling do it for a high price. 
Owning bitcoin is legal so I can mine and buy from fellow icelanders but if I would want to buy myself 1 BTC right now it would be much trouble since the Central Bank could take legal actions if I use my credit card and I would not get any foreign currency from my bank.
* Buying bitcoins in Iceland is very much trouble!
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:05:21
Interesting, why is that? What if I have a lot of process going on in the computer while creating new wallet?
@_date: 2014-03-09 10:50:46
Yes, more than one.
@_date: 2014-01-22 21:35:39
This is HUGE guys. I'll move over to Google+ if this turns out to be true... ;-)
@_date: 2014-11-19 16:31:55
Yes and it directed me to the same address. Address that had recieved some bits last couple of days.
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:12:28
Yes, both got the seed written down on paper and trying hard to memorize. Also I printed out my private keys to be extra safe and stored them in two different secure locations.
And at last put a copy of the wallet in a TC container.
@_date: 2014-03-08 12:47:18
Cold storage and hold, I'd do that.
@_date: 2014-03-08 13:06:48
Congratz mate we are on the same level!
Be sure to cold store it for extra safety.
@_date: 2014-01-24 10:38:43
What do you mean?
@_date: 2014-07-02 12:46:03
They are US citizens only, I'm not one.
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:58:40
Did you send your BTC from an exchange?
@_date: 2014-03-08 12:40:50
Ok. Do what IDontUnderstandIrony says. Boot up Linux from live CD and try data recovery.
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:12:51
Sorry for a typo!
@_date: 2014-01-24 10:36:12
That's correct aat58.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:37:56
Thank you, don't understand why I didn't figure it out ;)
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:09:42
Well said. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:53:28
No I just made bootable USB Ubuntu installer, and installed from that  onto another USB drive. Just be sure not to install over your hard drive, safest way is to unplug it while you install onto the other USB drive.
And no I don't use truecrypt on the USB, rather just encrypted home folder. But I've got the electrum wallet backed up in a TC container on another USB, just in case although it should be enough to keep the seed secure in memory or on paper.
@_date: 2014-07-02 12:58:54
Great I'll check that out. Wasn't an option when I signed up long time ago.
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:22:40
True about how they don't care for consumers, they just want to protect their own money printing machine!
They can decide to ban cryptocurrencies although we all know how **well** banning things work, right.
@_date: 2014-06-06 12:53:01
And that is something you could not do with fiat.
@_date: 2014-03-09 10:52:28
Yes you're right. I printed out both the seed and private keys and keep them at multiple safe locations in case of hardware failure.
@_date: 2014-06-06 12:54:34
A Linux bootable USB Etherum.
Memorize seed. 
Print out private key. Multiple copies. Store in multiple places you trust.
@_date: 2014-07-22 08:45:48
Take care if backing up to cloud services since this malware will also encrypt your e.g. *Dropbox* or *Google Drive* sync folders. So your backups might be encrypted also. 
Backup to external hard drive and keep it safe or to multiple cloud services without sync folders.
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:46:01

Já Íslendingur og ég kaupi ekki beint BTC með krónum en ég gæti það t.d. í gegnum local bitcoins. Eru amk. tveir ísl. að selja þar í gegn. Sjálfur kaupi ég í gegnum kauphöll útí heimi þar sem ég hef aðgang að reikning. 
Ég get selt þér BTC fyrir krónur ef þú hefur áhuga, getu pm. mig.

Page 18, "is Bitcoin the future of payments" is interesting.
@_date: 2014-03-08 12:41:55
I think you just answered yourself mate ;)
@_date: 2014-06-16 20:58:09
This is very nice of you kind sir. I live in Iceland behind capital controls so for me it is very hard to buy some bitcoins. Hope I get a little tip which I would use to teach my friends about bitcoins.
Good day,.
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:22:29
That is just amazing. Good work.
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:38:27
Yes, as has been pointed out, you could print out your private keys and then import them into whatever solution we'll have in the future. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 14:28:34
Ok I understand you. Well the capital controls or the currency restrictions if you will, applies to all foreign currency, whether it is US dollars, Canadian dollars or Danish krona. 
And also if people own any foreign currency, since they last went abroad, they are obliged to return that currency to an Icelandic bank in exchange for ISK krona. It's just crazy!
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:36:07
While the Bitcoin market is unregulated we will keep seeing this, I am not saying it has to be bad just we need to accept that fact.
We have seen a lot of "Insider Dealing" last couple of months and also other kind of market abuse. I think pump and dump as been the most practised!
@_date: 2014-07-02 12:39:31
No it's a Linux machine, can't be 100% sure but I am pretty pretty sure as I said around 98% sure, especially since it's not my first blockchain.info wallet, only the first one I don't use a disposable email address but my personal gmail.
I only used the blockchain.info website and their Chrome app to login and recieved some emails from them to my gmail.
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:09:17
Ouch for me, I just realized it now.
@_date: 2014-07-28 23:46:54
Ok I thought so but is there no way to make the offline wallet display more than five? It would ease my mind alot if I could see more than five private keys. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 12:00:40
Happy birthday all the way from Iceland. 
In Icelandic I would say: Til hamingju með afmælið!
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:13:20
Yes indeed, locations. ;)
@_date: 2014-06-16 20:58:52
Yes. Thanks for the correction. Sorry I'm late though ;)
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:08:57
LOL, that's why I have a backup both in a TC container and on paper ;)
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:13:42
Here is one which is good, 
[Link to pastebin](
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:58:38
I have the seed in a secure location. With the seed I can rebuild the wallet if I loose the USB, it stops working or accidentally delete my wallet file and private keys.
@_date: 2014-03-09 11:48:54
I did, both the seed and private keys is printed out.
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:24:50
That is true it would be a really big blow to Bitcoin if merchants would be banned to accept it. It could happen in Iceland, they have already stated how the Government has the sole license to issue money. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:43:35
Ok, then it is the way I thought. I just assumed the wallet would not allow me to create the transaction since it would be empty. 
Thank you guys!
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:41:52
Well done good sir.
@_date: 2015-01-22 12:18:11
He sould look into multi-signature transactions (m-of-n).
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:26:26
Articles written by Vitalik Buterin and Andreas Antonopoulos. Also there are couple of great Youtube videos featuring Andreas I can recommend. I am to lazy to Google now but it's an easy find for you.

Thanks. I'll be sure to try their service.
@_date: 2015-01-22 12:16:43
He should look into multi signature transactions or "m-of-n".
@_date: 2015-01-22 17:23:10
Perhaps not, but it could be used to solve one of the issues he mentions.

It truly is, I love mine! 
@_date: 2016-10-18 21:52:47
Yes, I guess so. Just to confirm I should still use the 'old' Chrome apps? Great device btw. and love the support. Thanks
@_date: 2016-10-18 20:41:44
Every time I try installing one of the new apps from the manager I get "Unable to install application" message. Any ideas whats wrong? 
@_date: 2016-10-18 21:11:48
Maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Do I still use the old Chrome apps? I can see Litecoin icon on my Nano, so maybe the error is because the app is already installed on the device. Or should I be able to open the apps from the manager? Hope you understand me. 
@_date: 2016-05-01 20:27:57
Thanks. Haven't looked into bittylicious, but will do.
Guess I could also use a debit card (but no bank transfer).

I was updating from 1.9.8 which has the 12 word seed. I tried typing the 12 word seed into version 2.5.1 and it didn't work. The new version won't allow you to press OK unless the seed is 13 words.
@_date: 2015-03-15 21:17:23
I agree with you and would use Circle if I would be controlling my private keys with their wallet 
@_date: 2015-03-16 08:35:56
Same as I thought.. 
@_date: 2015-10-18 18:53:13
I just now updated my cold storage from 1.9.8 to 2.5.1. Feel much better ;)
@_date: 2016-05-03 19:43:49
I´ll leave this here. Someone has been looking recently 
@_date: 2015-10-18 22:18:31
Yes, whole system is offline (bootable Linux on usb) and updated via fresh usb drive. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 21:03:21
No one knows. But we know they still be worth 20 bitcoins. 
Why do you need to hide them if I may ask? 
@_date: 2015-10-18 16:46:49
Updating regularly when you have a cold storage can be a hazzle. But you are right.

Hi. I have a Ledger Nano that I've been trying out and I like it very much. It's easy, and should be very secure? 
Today I store most my coins in a cold storage Electrum wallet. The wallet is however outdated and I have been thinking about moving my coins either to a newer version of Electrum (cold storage) or just to my Ledger Nano. I used the offline OS you provide to generate the seed. 
Could you tell my why I should use the Ledger Nano instead of Electrum (in this case)?
@_date: 2015-10-18 16:19:04
Yes. I think you are right. 
I want to use Ledger and Electrum together but I haven't gotten it to work. I'm not sure what I have to do or install so Electrum recognizes my Ledger.
Would I be able to create a working multisignature wallet (2 of 2) with Electrum by using 1 pubkey from Electrum and 1 pubkey from Ledger?
@_date: 2015-10-18 18:50:09
Alright, I'm looking forward to it. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 20:38:06
Nice site unfortunately my country is not one of the supported one - yet at least ;)
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:20:51
Exactly what I thought. Sad for Icelandic businesses, they would gain from accepting Bitcoin while behind currency restrictions.

I think I am not lying when I say that Bitcoin is illegal in Iceland. The country is behind currency restrictions and in addition they would probably have to pay VAT on Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 08:39:05
This is what I love about Bitcoin and this community here. There are so many heroes in here willing to do good. It's the Bitcoin effect.
Best wishes.
