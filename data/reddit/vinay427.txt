I always use 'waiter' as well in the US. I've only heard 'server' used in cafes or some restaurants where the server only brings the food to your table after you order at the front, but even then it's uncommon.

Chill out. He's saying that the owners wouldn't know if he left a tip, which gives the waiter or waitress an opportunity to pocket the reward for their good service if they wish to do so.

They should handle it just like credit card transactions using multiple currencies are handled. Airbnb pays the owner the rate they request in their local currency and accepts payment from the buyer at the price at the time of reservation. The 3% conversion fee they charge can be canceled out by lower Bitcoin merchant costs.

Part of the reason for 100% fraud protection in the US is due to the lack of chip-and-PIN cards that place the liability on the owner of the card rather than the bank. Without a PIN, it's very possible that the card may have been stolen and used without the owner's permission. That said, this doesn't explain chargebacks due to merchant fraud and scams.

Yep, they're certainly not communist. Singapore has some stringent social policies but economically is rather free and with a large private sector.

I am an American in the US and I'm interested by the news as well. If you don't mind, I'd rather you not propagate stereotypes by assuming everyone who doesn't appreciate global events is American.

You are being a burden by making everyone else either pay more or get less for their tax money. There is no way around this, and I don't see a justification for not valuing those around you enough to help contribute to the pool while using its resources. If you don't want to agree to the social contract, feel free to move to a place where there are no sales or income taxes. No one's stopping you.

I may have to stop over sometime from metro Detroit. :)

It's not unbelievable at all. Banks and credit unions operate under federal law (eg. insurance through the FDIC and NCUA), and they are liable to be sued if they accept money that the federal government views as illicit. This would essentially be an example of money laundering in the eyes of the feds.

I definitely hope this service doesn't give in, but many account holders at those banks were using the accounts as tax havens which I don't approve of either.

It can be free if you're willing to do a little preparation. A US bank account that allows for free international ATM usage (and refunds ATM surcharge fees) such as Schwab's and Fidelity's would receive the funds and you could withdraw at an ATM in Canada. This would give you CAD at the daily rate with no fees whatsoever. The real problem here is making a bank account in the US, but if you can get past that and are willing to spend the time it would work, in theory anyway.

Yes, because there's absolutely no reason that humans need to learn to speak other languages...

When it gets to a point of "give us the data or close shop" I seriously doubt most banks will resist the pressure like the Lavabit e-mail provider did. I can't really blame them given the circumstances, but if I were storing confidential information I would probably just choose to do so locally or physically.
