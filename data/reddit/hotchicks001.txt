US functionality - 
will this beta feature allow me to get btc without leaving my home from within the bread interface? 
thanks. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 05:10:41
Will this require ID or verification of bank acc, like when buying coins thru coinbase?
thanks again.

What about limits / weekly limits?
great information thanks again. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:12:41
coinbase will limit you at ~100 per week i believe. at least in US as a first time user. local btc has very large caps on usd amount. and u can get the best exchange rate w cash transactions local btc (around 95c on the dollar)

So really trezor only is good for 2fa, otherwise bread seems like the money!

@_date: 2016-12-29 05:20:36
right on good looks!
@_date: 2016-12-29 05:30:37
because if you lose your phone, you lose your coins. correct me if im wrong. trezor you can always store indoors in a safe allowing for "cold storage". 
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:27:07
not really. u can find somebody for ~.95c on the dollar for in person cash transactions or bank deposits. 
not bad.  
@_date: 2016-12-28 07:18:24
