It's two words.  Also, it means 'ass' in Finnish. Not the four-legged animal that goes "hee-haw!".

Also, if the two of them had 100% of all bitcoin between them, I'm quite sure it would become worthless.

It's easy to know what one should have done in the past.  If it wouldn't have taken off, you'd be like "I knew it was bad, glad I didn't buy".  I'm happy that it seems to work out neatly so far, but still, we don't know where this will end.
Going all-in on a single new asset can make people rich, or make them broke. One would have to be more of a gambler to invest more than one is comfortable to lose.

Yeah, seen globally, $3300 to invest on a single volatile asset is a lot for the average Joe, Chin or Mohammed...etc.

[A full node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks. Almost all full nodes also help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to further full nodes.](

Why is it difficult?  I'm thinking of starting one myself so appreciate any info on that.

No one knows.  If they say they know, beware. Learn as much as possible yourself and make up your own mind.  A lot of people think that this will carry on in the long run, and some don't believe that.  I would not buy as a short time investment, but I'm pretty happy right now, not gonna lie. :)

So you are guilty of selling drugs unless proven otherwise?
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:22:00
Thanks.  So what would one have to do to remedy that?

I interpret the following from the guide to say that if you run your own Bitcoin Core node, you should be relatively ok.  I'd like to hear if I misunderstood that.
"The most important thing you can do is perform your own network consensus by running a full-node and creating and storing your own private keys.
This will put you in firm control of all decisions related to how you interact instead of having some third-party make those decisions for you. "

Good input, thanks.

Would you say running a private wallet on an encrypted Linux VM and then do a backup of that encrypted VM onto another media, suffice in terms of security in most cases? Ideally the backup should be in a geographically different place as well, to avoid catastrophes like fire, flooding and what not.

Can't say I know the details in this particular case, but changing one's mind during 10 months doesn't necessarily mean one is a sellout. But maybe he is, dunno.

Whatever a person is willing to pay in dollars for the coin, at any one moment. What will happen in the future is speculation.
