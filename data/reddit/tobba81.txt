As soon as my little amount can make me and my wife debt-free, I’m out. That is all I want, and I will be HAPPY. Bugatti’s be damned.
And if/when this happens, what I have returns to circulation, which is a good thing.

Heh, fuckery is the right word. Haven’t even taken mine out of the box yet, have had it for days.

Read his name :-)

Did you downvote *me*..?

American Express VP? Isn't that kind of a big deal? That he's even remotely involved? 
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:07:46
You can decide that, if your brain is able to. Some can, some can't. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:53:28
Everyone... etc.
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:14:40
There there, boys...
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:06:43
They could cave their heads in with this. It would be murder.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:01:09
Why is that your go-to scenario? How about competition making companies strive to provide the best and most choices for everyone?

Educate yourself.

If I didn’t want that package, why should I care.

Never send text messages to random numbers from random people on the internet.
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:00:52
They offer. I decide. Think with your brain!

Why would it be 100k... I mean, thats just... enourmous. And when people throw out numbers like this, why not 1 million.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:56:09
Are you not worried the recipients will lose their coins? Or pass phrases etc.

@_date: 2017-11-16 23:05:41
always only use money you can lose. and think long term.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:04:53
10k worth of solid gold is not easily exchangable per se, and it need not be either for it to maintain value.

@_date: 2017-10-21 09:56:55
No, I don’t think you are ��
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:22:20
You are happy for them, though?
@_date: 2017-05-20 15:08:47
Are there 21 million billionaires??
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:17:48
Yes, but what does it mean? How does it answer my question? If it doesn't, why did you write it to me?
@_date: 2017-05-28 16:54:48
Mine are in Blockchain.info. Am I good?
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:23:11
@_date: 2017-05-28 22:17:13
It's okay ��
No, I didn't know that. In fact, I was of the opposite impression about Blockchain.info. 
I have two factor turned on, and the keywords written down. Still not good enough?
I thought that with the keywords I could restore to another wallet if Blockchain went down Mt. Gox-style?
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:31:16
Made me laugh :-) 
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:36:55
Just like it is today with "normal" money, is that what you mean? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:00:57
In a bitcoin economy, they'd have to rely on honesty. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:10:44
Will probably turn out as in Norway. Tax and VAT. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 09:14:10
Well good then, we have the answer right here! In this guy's feelings.
