Yes satoshi made the 1mb limit to avoid spam with the intention of increasing the block size later
@_date: 2018-09-02 15:39:35
Do you even check any of these stats?
Bitcoin has never had a block larger than 1mb, and the last 4 months it's been closer to 500kb than 1mb
@_date: 2018-09-02 12:01:02
Careful, this type of logical reasoning is how you get b****d

there was none, jimmy wrote a speech a read from it. Roger only found out the format when he arrived .
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:32:54
posing honest questions will not get you downvoted. lying or trolling obviously will. Implying the whole sub will downvote you simply becuase you prefer BTC is not true

Want to link a source? Luke Jr said he wants to decrease to 300kb

Only if everyone uses it, and right now after a year segwit adoption hasn't even hit 40% 
@_date: 2018-09-02 16:25:08
If the data still has to be propagated through the network, why was segwit implemented over a simple blocksize limit increase 
@_date: 2018-09-02 12:02:47
The block size will never increase. A modest increase to 2mb with segwit was even abandoned last year. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 11:10:53
Litecoin has the same blocksize as BTC, so that's a max of 500k txs on both chains per day. Then what? Visa does 150million a day
@_date: 2019-03-20 11:28:55
Someone with enough money could also 51% bitcoin, isn't really an argument 
@_date: 2019-03-20 10:50:40
With segwits 30% increase, bitcoin can sustain 2 million txs per week, so 280k people can send 1 tx per day, and expect to get into the next block (though if those txs aren't spread evenly throughout the day, next block confirmation isn't guaranteed). If any more than 280k txs are sent per day fees and wait times increase drastically as people compete for the privilege to be in the next block.

When fees go up can I add more funds to my channel without paying more fees or do I have to open a new channel?

The mindset that all users need to run a full node because SPV is dangerous will lead more and more people to custodial. No one wants to run a full non mining node.

@_date: 2019-03-21 20:35:20
but what if i get paid in BTC or if buy more BTC, do i have to make on chain transactions to get that BTC into my lightning channel?
@_date: 2019-03-20 11:47:23
Nope just realised ur a time waster 
@_date: 2019-03-20 11:21:48
 ye public opinion general affects price that's how markets work, how does it affect the viability of the network? 
@_date: 2019-03-20 10:56:13
With renewable electricity this isn't a problem.

bitcoin nodes running the ABC client upgraded to change consensus rules on August 1st causing the bitcoin network to split into two chains, BTC and BCH. This is why people recieved coins on both networks. During an airdrop, coins are sent to a receiving wallet, which is not what happend. Until BCH mined its first block, the history on both chains were identical, and from then on they diverged.
Don't spread lies. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 15:45:09
@_date: 2018-10-05 14:10:09
Yes the network did split, the first sentence:
It amazes me that you have to lie about this, it's literally in the name, a fork, is a split. If you recall the whitepaper these forks are intended by design. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 14:00:40
That's my point 
@_date: 2018-10-05 08:47:40
Litecoin is a clone, bch is a fork
E: this is an undisputable fact yet I get downvoted 
@_date: 2018-10-05 21:10:13
Did you know every member of the BCH community was once a member of the BTC community? I haven't said one negative thing about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 15:40:59
Isn't that what blockstreams liquid is for?

2 years going strong. I remember I was told in this sub it wud be dead before crimbo 2017. Wishful thinking

BCH currently has the same hashrate BTC had in Jan 2017. Was BTC not safe from 2009 to 2017?

Only 300k people can open a channel per day, and the ones who pay higher fees will be prefereneced over the ones who pay the minimum.
@_date: 2019-04-09 12:06:01
That's the limit.
