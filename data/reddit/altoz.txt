This is the cost of each transaction *to the bank*. You're comparing this to the total energy consumption of *the entire bitcoin network*. That is, all the costs of the bitcoin network without any of the revenue (tx fees and new bitcoins generated). To do a fair comparison, you should either subtract all the revenue generated by the bank ($2 ATM fees, $15 wiring fees, 2% merchant fees, etc) or add in the revenue generated by bitcoin.
In other words, you're comparing apples to oranges. The costs of transacting on a *per transaction basis* are still way better on the bitcoin side. The difference is that we know exactly what that is on the bitcoin side (tx fee + known inflation effects), where as on the banking side, a lot of that is hidden (tx fee + hidden inflation effects). And just based on the tx fee alone, we know bitcoin is a whole lot better.

Depends on what you mean by risk. I have to understand what my audience is before I can answer that question. Do you understand what the difference between p2pk and p2pkh is? The answer to that is at the heart of why bitcoin addresses essentially have 160 bits of information and why private keys have 256 bits.

Startling. If we're limited by CPU's we can expect the network to reasonably do at least 200 transactions per second. Having 32 MB blocks means, however, that the blockchain grows at around 4GB/day or 1 TB/250 days or so. Which, honestly isn't too bad, if pretty resource-intensive. 
We're ok for another order of magnitude or two of transaction increases on the network.

Two possibilities:
* "contribute to the strength of the network" =&gt; add hashing power. The amount your phone can do is trivial. Every smartphone on earth probably can't even equal a single 2TH/s miner. Impractical unless somehow mining chips make it into phones (not happening).
* "contribute to the strength of the network" =&gt; create more full nodes that can relay and propagate transactions. This may be marginally useful. That means your phone has to be always connected to the internet. You'll be using your precious data limits on propagating transactions. Unless data becomes much much cheaper, not going to happen.

By this logic, you can say flipping a coin 100 times or 80 times would provide security. You're not doing your audience any favors by using a number that happens to correspond to RIPEMD160. You make it sound like this tremendous burden to use the number 256 instead of 160, like there would need to be another hour tacked on to the video in order to use 256 and that's simply not the case. You can use 256 instead of 160 and everything goes through fine.

Coinprism coins could be used on OT. The work to do that involves what amounts to a plug-in.
The main reason for using Chromawallet's protocol instead of Coinprism's Open Assets is the security aspect of smart property. Coinprism's implementation of smart property requires that you destroy a key after you issue the property. Unfortunately, there's no way to prove destruction of information (there's no way for Apple to prove that they've destroyed your nude pics on their cloud backup, for example). Chromawallet's protocol is such that smart property is provably unique.
The idea is that while there might be multiple different schemes for issuing securities, OT can unite them all and allow greater privacy and security while keeping the transactions off-chain.

2. OP_RETURN, the rules around it and what you can do with it.
3. Backups, including paper wallets, what's getting secured, how they're getting secured, what the process is for restoring them, especially BIP0032 seeds and armory-style seeds.
4. Why certain things in bitcoin have changed. For example, p2pk addresses used to be more common, blocks are now version 2, testnet is on version 3, OP_RETURN now can have some data in it.

I disagree on both counts.
1. Utility requires liquidity. Liquidity at $1000 is far greater than at $1. There's a reason why many altcoins at much lower prices are much less useful than bitcoin. Namely, there's a bigger market.
2. The mechanism relies on network hashing power. The higher the price, the more incentive for miners. This is another thing bitcoin has over all the other altcoins, namely, a much larger network hash rate. The larger hash rate (that is, more miners and mining power in general) secures the network. The mechanism works a lot better (that is, in a much more secure way) when the price is higher. Witness all the altcoins that have basically been ruined by miners that brought great hashing power and then left.
Price matters. To claim otherwise simply is ignoring all the incentives that make up the whole system. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 13:37:53
Back of the envelope math:
Assume a decent CPU E7300 Core 2 Duo (25 Mh/s).
Network Hash rate ~ 250,000 Th/s = 250,000,000,000 Mh/s
Solo-mining it would take you 250,000,000,000 / 25 = 10,000,000,000 times longer to find 1 block. That's about 200,000 years to get a reward.
Pool-mining, that means you'll get roughly 25/200,000 ~ 0.000125 btc per year ~ $0.04 / year. That's assuming the hash rate stays the same. Much more likely, it'll at least double or triple, which means $0.02 /year is much more realistic.

No. Your address is something like 1EHNa6Q4Jz2uvNExL497mE43ikXhwF6kZm. That's actually got the hash160 of the public key. The hash in this case is 751e76e8199196d454941c45d1b3a323f1433bd6. This number then gets a 1 in the front and 4 checksum bytes in the back and base-58 encoded to get you the address.
The actual public key in this case is 0479be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798483ada7726a3c4655da4fbfc0e1108a8fd17b448a68554199c47d08ffb10d4b8

It's well known that mining is currently unprofitable. It costs something like $500-$650 on average to mine a bitcoin. The way to mitigate those losses is to not sell right away but wait for a higher price.
If the price keeps going down, this puts the miners in a squeeze. They can't wait forever as they have bills to pay and at some point, they have to sell large amounts at a loss in order to pay their bills. This means further downward pressure on bitcoin. I wouldn't be surprised if this was actually what's been happening with a lot of miners probably being squeezed.
Straight up, I hope the unprofitable ones go out of business. The ones that stay will be able to provide more hashing power at a lower price for everyone else.
@_date: 2014-11-17 00:01:11
Here's the answer, proof-of-work, which is at the heart of mining. If you find a solution that extends one chain, it won't work for the other chain. That's because the hash of the previous block is in the new block.
The probability of the proof-of-work solution working for both blocks is miniscule (on the order of 1 in 2^70 or so, or the probability of any single hash computed satisfying the proof-of-work) so the same block cannot be used to be the successor for two competing chains.
@_date: 2014-10-19 01:16:42
Not sure why you're so resistant to being corrected, but seriously, it's dangerous to suggest that 160 bits of entropy are all you need. There are security implications of implementing it that way and there's a very good reason no software actually does that.

The big thing they seem to want to try is demurrage. The Freicoin creator is on the sidechains team and that was the major innovation with that coin. Basically, the currency will constantly be decreasing in value and the difference will go straight to the miners. The idea is that most people won't be in such sidechains for long. Just enough to do what that particular sidechain is good at (fast confirmation or something else).

I'd imagine a sidechain would actually implement the encrypted amounts/zero-knowledge proof of the transaction balancing. When you transfer the actual amount over to the sidechain, there's no way to encrypt that particular transaction since the bitcoin side's amount is easy to confirm. That said, the sidechain side can have lots of outputs which then you have no idea how much is in each. Same thing on the transfer back to bitcoin.

Those btcec functions are pretty specific to the prime used in secp256k1 (2^256 - 2^32 - 977). All of them would have to be rewritten to the prime of the ed25519 curve.

So it seems like you're saying you want to make money pre-selling tokens to fund development. The track record of such projects is abysmal. So again, I ask why get investment in this way instead of, say raising money from VCs or bootstrapping?
As far as making money from an open source app, I can think of a lot of ways to make a profit off of something like this. Professional services, consulting, maintenance contracts, etc.


Totally fine goal. You can charge bitcoin to do that, though.


I'm not sure what this even means. Isn't Factoid a cryptocurrency? Or are you defining cryptocurrency in some different way than "scarce digital medium of exchange"?


You can also do what a lot of sites do and have accounts for each user and withdraw bitcoins on account as the user spends them. Also, obtaining Factoids will presumably require you to spend bitcoins to get and that too, will bloat the blockchain.

Transactions constantly are being transmitted, but if as a pool operator, you find a hash satisfying proof-of-work without one, you submit as soon as possible. This is because you want the 25 BTC. Including any additional transactions changes your hash and your proof-of-work is no longer valid and hence your block is no longer valid.

You can supply your own key when using bitcoinpaperwallet.com. Instead of using the website, you should download the source and run it directly from your computer to do so.

2. Use the HD wallet generator to create a new bitcoin address.
3. Plug the bitcoin address into your local copy of bitcoinpaperwallet.
4. Print the wallet.
Afterwards, you can back up the HD wallet.
As far as software that does HD wallets, I can't think of one off-hand that does off-line. If you're desperate, you can download pycoin and write a script to do that.

Amounts that large are already happening on OTC markets.
A buy that big would essentially be a buy wall that moves up a little at a time to allow market maker/arbitrage people to balance with other exchanges. Unlike the other direction, bitcoin moves fast enough that this balancing would be significantly faster. That is, we wouldn't have the situation like the bearwhale where Bitstamp was lower than everyone else. Honestly depends on how and when the $10 million are bought.

The only reason to wait for a confirmation is to be certain someone won't double-spend. The actual network finding out about the transaction is on the order of seconds, not minutes. After that, it's very difficult to double-spend unless you own 51% of the network hash rate, so for a merchant, this is a really tiny risk. Think of it this way, merchants take the risk of a chargeback every time they accept a credit card. That risk is substantially larger than that of a double spend. They're taking less risk accepting a transaction that's been propagated but not yet confirmed than they are accepting credit cards.

Put simply, p2sh is basically how you can "program money"*. For example, you can say something like "you need 2 of 3 people to agree to release this money". It can get a lot more complicated than that, but the applications are legion. For example, the guys at Armory figured out how to do a secure bet over the blockchain: 
You can have some very interesting scripts like "this one key or 5 of 9 keys can release this money". This would be useful for securing bitcoins in the event of your death (one key being yours and 9 keys belonging to 9 people you trust).
* Technical note: you can use other ways to do multi-sig and other scripts, for example, but p2sh is the secure way to do complicated scripts.
@_date: 2014-11-20 14:42:17
I'm sure these providers can help, but honestly, you can do this yourself.
1. Get paid from the merchant (presumably in dollars, euros or some other fiat currency)
2. Convert this money to bitcoin (coinbase, kraken, bitstamp are exchanges, but you can also do this on otc exchanges)
3. Pay your affiliates using bitcoin (they would have to set up their own bitcoin wallet)
In the future, hopefully, merchants would pay you in bitcoin and you can skip  but in the meantime, the actual payouts should be fairly easy to do and any competent accounting department should be able to keep track of who gets what. Internally, you'd have to add a little more security so people don't just steal these bitcoins. Whether that risk is higher than a third party stealing your bitcoins is up to you.

This depends on how you transferred bitcoins into the cold wallet. If you transferred 10 btc and then 20 btc and you wanted to get out 10 btc, it would be possible to construct the transaction in a way as to get out the 10 btc without the 20. Generally, though, the recommended procedure is thus:
1. Use software to import the private key into a hot wallet. (mycelium, bitcoind, armory, etc)
2. Transfer some of it to whatever address you need to spend it from, the rest into a new cold wallet.
3. Store the new cold wallet.
You can make all the cold wallets beforehand (they just would have a 0 balance) and this wouldn't be too burdensome. Just make sure that when you construct the transaction the change goes into the cold wallet.

Some things I can think of:
1. exact structure of a transaction, what each field means, what it's used for.
2. the signing process for each transaction, particularly, which fields are normalized and what gets signed by what.
3. how p2sh is processed, what exactly you have to provide when you want to spend money that belongs to it, how various things get calculated. how the script engine figures out where to insert the redeem script.
4. testnet, what it is, how to set it up, how to use it to develop, how to get free coins for it.
5. secp256k1, what the various numbers, n, p, G and so on are, how they're computed and what they're for. a small intro to ECDSA and elliptical curves in general would also be nice.
6. script engine examples. go through a typical script step by step, including how the canonical p2pkh one works.
7. bip0032 and how that works, what hardened keys are, what non-hardened keys are, what bip0044 standard is in relation.
8. structure of a block. what each field means, how they're calculated, how they're used.
9. network difficulty and exactly how that's calculated, how difficulty adjustments happen.
10. networking/peering and how that works currently. how does a node get "onto" the network, how can it be certain it's getting the right data
11. SPV and how that works, what data is transferred, what data is verified by a thin client.
12. useful tools that can be used for developers wanting to start developing on the blockchain.

You *can* generate one, by filling in 0's for all the other slots, for example, but that's not what any software actually does, nor is it accurate to say that the 160 bits are what's actually encoded in the WIF format you show in the video. 
What's encoded in the WIF private key is 256 bits. And actually, older transaction outputs (p2pk instead of the newer p2pkh) actually require all 256 bits to be there.
In any case, what you *can* do vs. what it actually *is* are very different things. You should describe what actually *is* and in that case, every piece of software out there actually generates 256 bits of entropy to create a key instead of 160 bits for the very good reason that it would make the whole system less secure.

If the issuer issues more of a particular smart property, which is supposed to be unique, we now have competing assets that are claiming to be the smart property. You may be right that the resolution of which one may be straightforward (for example, always go with the oldest one). But that's depending on all future software and users of the smart property to know to resolve and verify.
There are security scenarios like the key of the issuing address being stolen combined with some sort of man-in-the-middle attack which makes it seem to a particular SPV node that the smart property belongs to the thief of the key and not the actual owner. We can avoid whole classes of vulnerabilities like this by using the transaction-issuance model.
To put it simply, it's in all likelihood possible to do with CoinPrism, but it's neither as secure nor as easy to implement.
@_date: 2014-10-18 20:57:02
This is imprecise in the video. You claim the private key in WIF format (the thing starting with 5) requires 160 coin flips to generate. WIF actually encodes 256 bits. It's more accurate to say that searching a space of 2^160 private keys should on average hit the intended bitcoin address (bitcoin script). In that sense 96 bits aren't strictly necessary, but they're certainly not discarded.

Basically, there are bitcoin projects in every language. The big thing to learn is the actual protocol. You're going to want to learn all the elements of a transaction, all the elements of a block, script, etc. Honestly, though, it's a bit dry to take on without some active project that forces you to learn it. I would highly recommend joining an open source project to learn.
Python is a very popular language in the bitcoin community, including some pretty fun projects like electrum, armory and chromawallet.
As far as employability, your big advantage is going to be in knowing the ins and outs of bitcoin itself, not a particular language. Any tech company worth its salt will be hiring you regardless of experience in a particular language if you have talent.

As others have pointed out, your miner will take roughly (250,000,000 network hash rate / 5 Gh/s = 50,000,000 times longer ~ 950 yrs) to mine a single block. Assuming you are in North Korea for that long and the 100 transactions are in the block you mine, once you return from North Korea, you are correct, your transactions would no longer be confirmed (they only had 1 confirmation anyways).
1) The behavior of the client is entirely dependent on the software. Some may start relaying the orphaned transactions, some may not. Depends on your wallet.
2) You can't change the difficulty manually. However, after you find the 2016 blocks, the network will automatically adjust so that you can find one block every 10 minutes.

Here's how miners typically set up manufacturing:
1. Come up with a rudimentary design. (optional)
2. Line up some factories to make the design and get some prices on how much it would be to manufacture X units.
3. Sell a bunch of preorders based on a wildly optimistic timeline of everything being manufactured really quickly.
4. Take the money from (3) and actually manufacture X units, often with a lot of delays.
After (4), many manufacturers are in a deep hole cash-wise. They've spent money manufacturing a bunch of units, maybe have a few extra and need more money. Easiest solution, mine with machines that are pre-orders. This is what BFL is being accused of doing.
Pre-orders obligate the company to actually send these machines to the customers, so that's nominally the reason why they "don't" use the product.

Calling me a troll won't make you right. If you were right, then I could speed up the elliptical curve math done in the bitcoin client by 30% easy (because of the 96 places where there would be 0 instead of entropy). And given that elliptical curve math is easily the slowest part of calculating anything in bitcoin, this would be an enormous speedup.
So hm, why doesn't the reference client or any other implementation (electrum, armory, btcd) do it your way? Hm?
Could it be you are wrong? No, it's because they're all dumb and don't recognize your genius. Clearly, they should all just use 160 bits and leave the other 96 as 0's!
Your video is wrong. And until you've coded NAF algorithms in elliptical curve cryptography to speed up bitcoin clients like I have, you don't really have any standing to call me a troll or claim that I'm wrong.

1. The post-inflationary period will be long after you're dead. Sometime after 2100. At that time, the rewards will mainly be in transaction fees.
2. If some bitcoins get destroyed, all the other bitcoins now gain in value. the reason wall st. can control gold and silver prices is largely due to naked short selling and other derivative techniques. With bitcoin, it's very hard to do that and those that do go bankrupt eventually. There's a hard ledger and once something like voting pools is implemented, it'll make it very difficult to do any sort of fractional reserve smoke and mirrors.

The details of possible attacks are here:
You can read about the various ways in which such attacks can work. But if a merchant takes reasonable precautions, like not allowing incoming connections, it's very difficult to do without a large hash rate, a cooperation of a miner or both. Since most merchants use BitPay or Coinbase or something similar and these places do take reasonable precautions, it should be very difficult to do.

It's called arbitrage. A lot of people have done that. Here's how to do it properly.
Keep $X and A BTC on exchange 1
Keep $Y and B BTC on exchange 2.
Whenever the exchange rate on 1 is cheaper, you buy BTC on exchange 1 and sell on exchange 2. The amounts should be exactly the same. Whenever the exchange rate on 2 is cheaper, you do the opposite.
Here's the risk. If the exchange collapses, now you've lost all your money on that exchange. This, in fact, happened to a lot of people that were arbitraging Mt Gox. Any spread between any two exchanges is either this risk or the cost of getting dollars out of the exchange.

I never claimed you have to teach beginners everything every time. I've said this many times, which you don't seem to want to acknowledge: the video is fine if you use 256 instead of 160. No other explanation or additional material is necessary. It's a factual error that should get corrected. It's akin to a history video saying that the Declaration of Independence was first signed on July 20, 1776. It's not simplifying anything to get the date wrong. I'm the guy arguing you should put it to July 4, 1776, and you're arguing something like "well, only one person actually signed that day and I didn't want to put all that explanation in the video". Well, no, you just got the date wrong. You just got a major detail wrong.

Much respect to you as you've done a lot of good for this community.
I will respectfully disagree as to the nature of the boycott. Those that believe PayCoin to be a scam want some blood. That much is true. And unfortunately, there aren't many venues to get their pound of flesh. The Miami conference is one of the few places where you can (sort-of) hurt them. 
They paid for a sponsorship, so boycotting the conference is a way to lodge their protest. I personally don't think it'll be that effective. After all, they already paid their sponsorship money and it's a sunk cost for them. That said, they will have a booth there and boycotting will deprive them of whatever benefits they hoped to gain from sponsoring the event.
What the boycotting people want is for the conference to disown Garza and PayCoin. The boycott is a threat and it's one whose heart is in the right place. If this conference is as important as you say it is (I have some doubts about the efficacy of these conferences, but whatever), then this is an easy-to-remedy, if not somewhat costly, fix.
Of course, PayCoin and Garza can put a stop to this, too, by dropping out of the event or coming clean and explaining at the conference. Either way, there are other parties that can satisfy what the boycotters want. I personally don't think it's fair to single out the least blameworthy of these parties and telling them what the right thing to do is.

All you had to do was explain it was 256 bits, not 160. You'd have to come up with some other number than Quindecillion and that part of the video would have been correct. No need to explain p2pk/p2pkh/sha256/ripemd160/secp256k1 or anything else. You just got the number wrong, man. The WIF key encodes 256 bits, not 160. You teach a lot of good stuff, you just got it wrong there. It happens to the best of us. God knows I've been chewed out by Greg Maxwell and Luke Jr. enough times.
So now that I know you know the difference between p2pk and p2pkh, let me answer your first question. For p2pk, the security depends solely on secp256k1. If ECC or that specific curve gets broken, p2pk is broken. p2pkh, on the other hand has the property that you need to break 3 things (assuming you haven't already spent something from the same address):
* ECC/secp256k1
* SHA256
* RIPEMD160
If you use 96 zeros for the first step (the private key for the secp256k1 curve), you are weakening that part of the security. Now, we don't really know what the vulnerabilities of the ECC curve are. From what Maxwell's told me, the twist of the secp256k1 curve is actually pretty vulnerable and hence a bit more prone to attack. Limiting the input space from ~2^256 to 2^160 makes attacks against the curve drastically easier. This still means that as long as you've never spent from the address, you're protected by SHA256 and RIPEMD160. But if you use p2pk or more likely, have spent from an address even once, your private key is now more vulnerable. In what scenarios? Hard to say, but imagine a quantum computer that has 600 qubits and can run through numbers on the order of 2^165. In your scheme of padding 96 zeros, if you have ever spent money from an address, that address would now be at risk whereas the normal 256 bits of entropy would not.

Sidechains are basically pegged currency. There are currencies like the Danish Krone which are pegged to the Euro, for example. But while fiat currencies are pegged to a range "between x and y krones to a euro", sidechains have a fixed peg.
In order to do this, there has to be a side blockchain that processes the pegged currency. The nice thing about sidechains is that all transactions in the sidechain are off the main blockchain and you can experiment with different parameters, like quicker transaction times and different denominations. The hard thing is that sidechains require some change in bitcoin to work properly and the sidechain needs a different way to process blocks (called proof-of-work for bitcoin).

If it costs nothing to help the network, it would be trivial to sybil-attack with it. If you want to help the network, you're going to have to spend money. Here are the things you can do:
1. Mine - You may be forced to do so at a loss if you live in an area with high electricity costs (or even moderate electricity costs, it's that competitive)
2. Buy/sell - This is the most natural one for most here. Buy coins if you approve of what's going on, sell if you don't. As an investor this is the clearest signal you can send.
3. Develop - This isn't for everybody, obviously, but help make bitcoin better. You don't necessarily have to make Core better, just any bitcoin-related open source project.
4. Start a bitcoin business - This is the best one because you help yourself and the ecosystem by giving bitcoin more utility.

While the sentiment of this post is greatly appreciated, I think it's misguided.
First of all, if you're holding bitcoins, you're already helping bitcoin. The value of bitcoin comes from the holders and the fact that you're holding is probably the best thing for the community as well as you. Capitalism is great like that. See this classic Nakamoto Institute article for more information: 
Second, I'm very skeptical about making more purchases with bitcoin will somehow add to the adoption. Other than merchants that take bitcoin exclusively (silk road, ransomware, certain mining equipment), most merchants don't get much of a sales increase as a result of taking bitcoin. Now why is that? The reason is that while bitcoin is great money and fiat is not. Thus, when bitcoin holders are given a choice, they spend fiat instead. Even the OP here is telling people to "buy bitcoin and spend it". That's just one step removed from spending straight fiat. Doing that is both more annoying (you have to buy bitcoin with fiat to replace the bitcoin you're losing) and less beneficial for the consumer (no credit card protection, no rewards, etc). Now there may be special circumstances where there's benefit to using bitcoin (purse.io comes to mind), but that's much more the exception than the rule.
Third, if you're transacting more with bitcoin, you're adding to the transaction pool thereby increasing the price of doing transactions for everyone else. Bitcoin is a great store of value. It's very hard to confiscate because it's relatively cheap to secure. But as a medium of exchange, it's really not better for the consumer except for certain very inefficient practices in the market (foreign remittance, digital black market, etc)
I will agree that perhaps talking to other people about bitcoin can be beneficial, but other than getting other people to buy and hold, the best thing you can do is also buy and hold.

In the sense that each individual miner can choose which chain to extend, you're right it doesn't need coordination in that sense. What I mean by coordination is that all those pools that *want* to choose to extend only segwit-signalling blocks need patches to their software so they don't accept non-segwit-signalling blocks. And obviously, no one is going to start running such software without some assurance that they're not the only ones doing so. *That* requires coordination since you need to know what other people are running and for how long.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but this sort of patch isn't some setting that you put in your bitcoind.conf. You have to have a patched binary that will do this.

paging and You guys play nice now.
@_date: 2016-11-18 16:11:21
I think 90% is as unachievable as 95%. And remember, there's a time limit to segwit. The signaling ends if it fails to gather 95% by November 2017. Segwit opponents know this, too. You have 26 (possibly a few more) difficulty adjustment periods to either activate segwit or not. Just the coordination of getting all the segwit proponents on the same page in terms of software, getting them to an agreement where nobody can easily betray, etc is not going to be easy or fast. The opponents have the clock on their side.
You're talking about game theory, so let me lay out some scenarios that might happen:
1. A new pool that's pro-segwit shows up with about 5% hashing power. It joins this coalition, agrees to everything. At the last minute, it switches to anti-segwit because they were bribed, manipulated or whatever. Now your 90% becomes 85% and the risk profile changes and some other pro-segwit miners are not comfortable and leave.
2. An anti-segwit pool starts offering incentives to come to their pool. After every month, they'll give out some extra amount of bitcoin based on your hash rate. It can easily become the dominant pool.
3. A pro-segwit pool gets attacked with miners to make it look unlucky (these miners throw away good hashes)
There's a ton more, but this isn't a simple one-threat, one-response scenario, what you're talking about is war and there are a lot more tactics you need to account for.

@_date: 2016-11-18 15:52:35
The reason people switch mining pools are many, including:
* lower commissions somewhere else
* higher hashrate somewhere else (and thus, lower variance)
* their current pool is being ddos'ed
* their current pool is cheating them by reporting more shares existing than there are
* their current pool is insolvent
* their current pool has terrible security practices and is ripe for failure
* their current pool is unlucky due to being attacked by other pools
... and so on
Maybe way down on this list is something like "pool isn't signaling the features I want on the network". Most miners are not ideologues, they're capitalists. They bought these very expensive machines to make money. Some may care about whether segwit gets activated, but that's almost certainly not their primary consideration for the vast majority that are trying to get a good return on investment.

The bitcoin protocol is supposed to be hard to change. That's how it was designed. The signal is going to be either that:

2) everything stayed the same because there was enough objection
I don't think either one is an "unambiguous signal".

A few nits:
1. If you don't have a direct channel open with your counterparty, you lose some privacy. Specifically, the in-between nodes of the network will have information about you.
2. Given that all channels have to be open on-chain and the costs of opening a channel are such that you lock up all bitcoin in the channel while it's open (not to mention the transaction fees), you'll generally be incentivized to open as few channels as possible.
3. Given  a very likely network model that will result is a hub-and-spoke model, which is where everybody opens a channel with a central node which acts as a router of most lightning network transactions.
4. Given   becomes a much bigger concern since the "hub" will know a lot about you.
5. For the lightning network transactions to be secure, you have to be online to check that your counterparty is not cheating. Not a huge problem if you already trust your counterparty, but again, this makes opening new channels with strangers a little more costly and moves the network topology more towards hub-and-spoke. 
6. It's possible if you don't have a route to your counterparty that you can't use the lightning network to send or receive, again, moving the network toward hub-and-spoke.
Now, privacy might not be much of an issue if you're a business accepting payments or if you're using multiple lightning network channels over TOR and in general, I believe the LN to be an important innovation. That said, there are important drawbacks to consider and everyone should be aware of them before jumping in and using it when it becomes available.

Note that the nuclear option would require the colluding pools to all have the same software which will orphan any blocks made by everyone who's not signaling segwit. AFAIK, this would require a patch to the core client that they would all need to activate at once.
Furthermore, even with something like 60% of the total hashing power, you need about 5-6 blocks to catch up before the orphaned block would be really orphaned (remember, you need to produce x+2 blocks where x is the number of blocks produced by the competing orphans). Not only will this be really disruptive to the network (how will anyone accept any transactions when there are two competing chains that are twice as slow?), but if even a small portion of the hashing power decides to leave mid-stream and your chain loses, your coalition will have wasted a significant amount of hashing power and lost a ton of money.
Now, it's possible that a generous backer can compensate for this risk. But then the same can be done on the other side. Any sort of escalation starts to become a very expensive war.  So I suppose you're right. It's nuclear in the sense that it'll most likely destroy a lot of the security of the network and perhaps even threatening such a change would be enough to get people to comply.
But if I've learned anything about bitcoiners, it's that they don't take being told what to do kindly.

I don't think coercion is going to be a great strategy and has a huge risk of backfiring. Nothing stops people from creating new pools and the actual owners of the mining equipment can choose to change pools at any time. Even if you can convince most of the pool operators, actual miners can and probably will seek new pools that agree with their position.
The giant risk for pool operators that are trying to strongarm hashrate to their preferred signaling is that you risk losing a significant part of the miners that are part of your pool. It only takes a few dissenters before a downward spiral happens where you lose some miners and hashing power because of your decision, which causes more people to leave which causes you to lose even more hashing power and so on. Soon a pool that has 10% might have something like 2%.
The economics of the situation are such that you truly need 95% of actual mining equipment owners to vote for segwit. Otherwise, pools take on enormous risk of getting smaller, less influential and ultimately losing the commission that comes with running a pool.

Of course, in a technical sense you're right, but there's no technical time limit since like you said, you can continue switching between two bits. But this isn't a purely technical battle. It's a political one where the bit matters.
In your example, every segwit proponent would have to switch bits would mean they would need to change the binary that they run. Are all people that run the previous version of the software guaranteed to move to the new version that's using a different bit to signal? Most probably will, but there's no guarantee. In that sense, there absolutely is a deadline for this proposal.
In other words, what you're saying is equivalent to "we can just do the same proposal a year from now when it expires". Yes, that's technically true, and you do start the clock again, but it's still politically (and even technically, since it's a different bit) a different proposal. Most likely if this happens, there will be debates on whether to lower the threshold from 95% and so on. I doubt if after a year of this, that the segwit activation will be exactly the same. Hence, there is a real deadline for the opponents to go towards.

There's a reason people use full-node wallets. SPV nodes by your reasoning are perfectly safe since they only leak IP addresses associated with addresses (actually, SPV is safer since they use bloom filters, but that's besides the point).
Fact of the matter is that IP addresses are a huge privacy leak. At the very least, you can figure out what area of the world the user is in and with a cooperative government or even an ISP, you can tie that transaction back to the actual person that performed the transaction. For example, the DEA may decide to be a lightning hub so they can figure out who's buying drugs. An IP address and a warrant is enough to get you arrested. Perhaps you have no sympathy for someone like that, but how about payment to a whistleblower or political donations?
Opening additional channels means paying more chain fees adding more tx's to the chain and so on. Each additional channel has a real cost, so while you can pay to have more lightning network identities, the network is incentivized towards less channels in general.
You can outsource watching the network, but again, you have a third-party trust problem. How do you know if they're not going to screw you over? How do you know they won't get hacked or be DDoS'ed so they can't see the transactions? If you want certainty and trustlessness, you need to do things yourself.
Each channel you open requires you to lock up funds and pay on-chain transaction fees. This is a cash-flow nightmare. The incentives are to keep as few channels as possible for that reason.

Some assumptions by this post that really need some careful thought:
1. First part assumes sidechains will be implemented and available. Given the contentious nature of the current segwit activation, I have serious doubts that OP codes required for sidechains to function would get activated. My guess is that if segwit fails, sidechains will be likewise viewed by the 2MB crowd as a too-complicated block size increase.
2. Payment channel hub and spoke model can work, but it is a privacy nightmare. Essentially, the central hub knows everything and that reduces the utility.
That said, I believe in the market. Someone somewhere will come up with something that can get everyone what they want. I've had the position for a while now that block size increase or no increase, the market will find a way to make money flow the way it needs to. The most important thing to keep in mind when predicting the future is humility. You can't predict the future. There are too many innovators in this space for problems to go too long unsolved.
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:19:26
5-10%, while helpful, is hardly significant in the grand scheme of things. 95% activation is necessary and we're very far away from that. 5-10% increase, from, say 75% would be a much more significant move. As it stands, it looks like segwit won't happen for at least another few difficulty adjustment periods.

It would take a minimum of 2 weeks where all the colluders (including individual mining equipment owners) would have to work in lock step to create a fork. I just don't see it happening as it requires a lot more coordination and acceptance of risk.

1 year is standard. You don't want proposals that aren't going to activate continue to take up version bits.
Most likely, there will be new proposals that either compromise or change the required percentage.

I just read your medium post. I didn't see anything about the lock up idea being a myth? Are commitment transactions no longer necessary? I would be ecstatic if that weren't the case and you could somehow spend the same bitcoin in multiple channels at the same time.
Also, I addressed the outsourcing of the watching for cheating. It's a nice feature, but you're now forced to trust a third party to do that for you, which isn't great for a lot of reasons.
@_date: 2016-12-29 16:16:43
For one, they have to know your IP address. Now, you, being a privacy advocate, wouldn't store that, but not every operator will and in any case, it's very hard to prove you didn't store something. Second, if lightning network routing is mostly chosen on pricing, a party that wants to information gather simply needs to set up a hub that's cheaper.

I wouldn't consider war or separation huge possibilities on this particular issue. The conditions in which they happen are clear enough (after Jan 2016 and 75% of last 1000 blocks signalling that they are all ready to mine big blocks). That's a pretty high hurdle as it is. And the incentives being aligned the way it is, if XT reaches that point, they've pretty much won. 
The battlefield here isn't land. The battlefield is mining power and XT has encoded the conditions of battle. They'll only fight when they already have 75% of the system is ready to revolt. So war, if it happens will already have 75% or more on the XT side which should make the other 25% or less come over fairly quickly.
Nothing and diplomacy seem like much more likely outcomes. As in other political maneuvers, it wouldn't surprise me if the whole XT project is leverage to get a single change to 8mb blocks more agreeable in a negotiation.
@_date: 2015-08-16 03:18:19
Here's the real reason Bitcoin is forking.
From Peter Todd bitcoin-dev mailing list November 6, 2014:


The XT patch is doing exactly this. Enough miners adopt it and it becomes the protocol. Whether it gets adopted by bitcoin or not is entirely up to the community, especially the miners. There's a very interesting question of whether miner consensus is enough to shift the protocol. If it is, then maybe core developers have more power than we thought, because they essentially make the ballot choices available.
What's fascinating to me is that the fundamental political behaviors (censorship, contentious debate, parties, etc) have emerged. Political solutions will have to emerge to solve it. There's a whole host of possible outcomes including:
* nothing (status quo through inaction)
* diplomacy (some consensus arriving through negotiation)
* war (one side taking over the other through any means necessary)
* separation (bitcoin and bitcoinXT)
I listed these roughly in the order of probability as a political matter.

Hard forks are also another way. Either way, it's a protocol change, the difference between hard fork and soft fork is not relevant to the political nature of the discussion.

@_date: 2017-04-07 16:54:47
It's very easy to hide. You need 12 tx's (very generous and high estimate) with the same fee on the right side of the Merkle Tree and just shuffle those. Even if you order tx's by fee (which blocks don't do strictly), you can't detect it if there are 12 such tx's. If you look at blocks and the fees that are being paid, they cluster around round numbers so it's very easy to find 12 such transactions.

Overt ASICBoost is most likely built into Bitmain's products. Probably has been for a while. Covert would require a lot more circuits and different software than their open source pool software (which has a stratum extension for overt ASICBoost).

If you are using Armory and are concerned with using USB drive that can get infected, simply use an SD card. The firmware attack vectors that exist on USB cards don't exist on SD cards.
Fragmented paper backups are a good idea as well, especially if you don't let the trusted friends know about each other. You can do something like 3-of-5 where you own 2 of the keys and distribute the other 3. That way, if something happens to you, you can specify in your will who the 3 people are and what they should do with the funds. You can also create multiple fragmented backups so you can have a 4-of-7 and 3-of-5 for the same wallet. This opens up more possibilities of how you can split them in such a way to get the security properties you want.

A lot of bugs still exist in bitcoin, programmers know about them and deal with it: 
Basically, bugs have become part of the protocol and they're mostly well-known. The bitcoin alert system still exists and can be used to send alerts to every node. Most bitcoin software does at least something to alert the user if such an event happens. Generally, the thing that people are supposed to do when they receive an alert is to first go look it up and second, possibly upgrade to a newer version that handles the consensus bug.

Nice project! You can publish a "signing" bip32 wallet on the blockchain as an OP_RETURN and use the hash of the website url as the key index to sign for that website. That would let you publish the secondary key only once but have it be good for all possible websites.

Creating the multisig address is fairly straightforward. It's the spending from a multisig address that's the problem. You need signatures from the holders of each private key and there's no standard way to transfer a partially-signed transaction for these applications. It's honestly not that hard to program, though, and I expect that if there was demand, this would be something wallet developers would happily add.
That said, the Armory Lockbox works pretty much the way you would expect with spending and you can have 3 instances on 3 machines and it will work.

Yes, we know. In fact, it's not even so simple as having a local bitcoin-qt running, you have to have bitcoind running with txindex, which on a normal install can take several hours to reindex. We're working on making it use electrum servers and blockchain explorers to alleviate this.

The way it's done on Bitcoin-OTC is that you are challenged with a message to sign and then you sign it and reply back with the signature hash.
Linking an address to your real world identity can be a bit problematic. According to the bitcoin core devs, addresses are supposed to be single-use. That is, after it's used to send bitcoins even once in the blockchain, you really shouldn't use it again.
The bigger question is, who do you need to prove the ownership to? If it's another user, I've written a simple way to encrypt messages to an address here:
Any party that wants to be certain you own an address can simply message you at that address and only you should be able to read that message. And hence you can prove you own the address by simply telling the other person what was written.

It's a little difficult to answer this question. What exactly do you mean by protocol? The architecture is such that "coloring" coins is basically taking inputs and outputs and using some logic to determine how to color the outputs based on the colors of the inputs. We call these rules the color kernel and the architecture is such that you can have different color kernels and in fact, we do have several in the client.
The nice thing about colored coins the way we've implemented them is that it's entirely in the blockchain. To a color-ignorant observer, the transactions on the blockchain look like normal bitcoin transactions. It's only when you add the kernel that you can learn which transaction outputs have which color.
Thus there really isn't any "agreement" necessary per se. Each kernel is consistent and new kernels can be easily integrated. Make sense?

I've talked to fellowtraveler and he's working very hard on it. Apparently, OT is usable for a few things already and the main thing he's working on is getting the user interface to be better. I'll let him elaborate on exactly what, but that's my impression.
The reason I've been talking to him is because colored coins (Chroma Wallet is the project I'm working on) are necessary for some of the functionality he's been working on. There's actually a 10BTC bounty in that same holy grail thread on bitcointalk to incorporate colored coins into OT.
Suffice it to say, it's under active development and the prototypes I've seen look pretty good.
