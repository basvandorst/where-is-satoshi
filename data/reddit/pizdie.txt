why is Bitshares not in this list?

I can say the same about Trezor/Ledger where new users can simply forget their PIN code and 24 characters mnemonic phrase. Then what?

Yes its a fact that no private keys are stored directly onto the device. Instead the Bitfi algorithim works like a brain wallet that generates a private key with a passphrase. Its up to you what that passphrase should be. It's patent pending im assuming because it is the first digital asset device to actually provide it.

Total bullshit. He doesn't even explain what he did and those links he posted showed absolutely nothing. The Bitfi wallet is not a storage device of your private keys.

yes, I believe so

I like your boldness. As much as I would love to run through timestamps and algorithmic hash functions all day long. The whitepaper does a better job at explaining it

Its the same idea when you sign for transactions on a Trezor or Ledger Nano S. However, the difference with these devices is they actually store your private key on the device while being connected to the internet. Many people don't realize that.

what street did you see this on?

Thank you for the explanation. You're saying the Bitcoin market cap is a bad approximation? How do we really know how many Bitcoins were lost to make this rough guess.
