Thank you for your support so far... he still has his wallet.aes.json file from 2013.
Tnx for the tip 1BitcoinOrBust!
Let me try to be as clear as possible:
- He opened his wallet in 2013 (created in 
- Till this weak he sold and bought a few btcs via his original bitcoin adress (created in 2013)
- Lately he had 2 wallets sections in blockchain.info:
  1: his original adres with bitcions (e.g. 1F1tAa45x8HUXrCNLbtMDqcw6o5tNn4xqX) were the bitcoins are still stalled (blockchain called this the
      imported wallet)
  2: his Blockchain wallet (created automatically somewhere olong the line) containing 0 Btc
      Blockchain asked him to transferr his Btcs to this wallet for security reasons, wich he never did...
- He wrote down 12 words to gain access in case of emergency like few months back.
- Yesterday he had to use his 12 words because he lost his password
- After opening the blockchain wallet with the 12 words he only sees his Blockchain wallet with 0 Btc
- Helpdesk told him they could not connect the imported adress to his main acct..?
Hope this clears the questions about what how when....
I realy hope he's lucky he has an old wallet.aes.json file.
 he never backed something up other than the 12 words on paper and the json file in 2013

His bitcoins were stalled on a wallet created on the site blockchain.info in 2013.
And later you see the original imported (but imported is created here in the past) adress and a "your own wallet" in blockchain.info. 
Now after the reset he lost his imported adres...
