Join them. Get on the inside. Put on a fake ass smile and break bread with some of the guys at the top of the pyramid. Get them hammered/drugged, then watch the truth come out. Record it and send the audio into the SEC, post it on youtube, post it on FB. Unfortunately this is the only way to truly expose ponzis like this. Be wary though if you hold bitcoin because exposing a scam such as bitconnect or bitclub network will lead to a crash in the price. Many of these ponzis encourage members to not only buy shares in their mining schemes, but to also buy bitcoins. Once you expose the ponzis, then the members will likely want out of crypto currencies completely. IMO if one of the ponzis get legitimately exposed, then the bubble will burst.

it's prob gone.

didn't he program the network? couldn't there be a backdoor for him to bypass the proof of work system?

imo if some of the MLM/Ponzi schemes that use bitcoin mining as a way to scam people (e.g. bitclub network) are exposed, then bitcoin will crash. These ponzis encourage members to not only buy additional shares in their mining network, but to also buy bitcoin as much as possible. I'm a part of a few of their facebook groups and it's extremely cringey how uninformed the members are. They have no idea what bitcoin is or how it functions, but they buy into these Ponzi schemes. If they discover they're being scammed, then I think they'll not only get out of the mining network, but will sell any remaining bitcoin they have.

just try it again.

Equifax? No. The SEC? yes.

I work for a firm that helps companies implement blockchain lol. A lot of the clients are intrigued by it, but when they're being led by 60+ yr old executives who can't even operate excel, then it's a little difficult to get them on board. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 03:11:48
yes, many companies are embracing blockchain technology.

stupid question, but how do we know the supply is fixed? could there not be a way for satoshi to create bitcoins out of thin air?
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:33:21
Jamie Dillon is the man. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:20:55
Nope. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:48:01
I'm talking about if you buy something with bitcoin (e.g. buying something off overstock with bitcoin). 
@_date: 2017-09-22 06:08:50
can you expand on this comment:


You can not take bitcoin the currency out of the picture and expect to keep the promise of immutability.
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:48:11
why? 
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:17:57
only issue is less companies will accept it due to the increase in volatility, which will further decrease the demand.
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:17:10
Thanks for the heads up. Now I can write in support of Barry. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:04:02
BTC is rising?? wooohoooo more taxes!!
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:42:17
Unfortunately the cost of implementing blockchain technology is what turns companies away from it. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:40:02
What a shifty and inaccurate analogy. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:38:39
try contacting the SEC.

Time to dust off my old key loggers

why can't i fear both?
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:15:17
Lol bitcoin will go down. What increases during a financial crisis? unemployment. What decreases during a financial crisis? disposable income. Holders will be forced to sell in order to create cash for living expenses (and they'll pay a hefty tax on top of that unless they're unemployed). 
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:44:32
How do you think it should be treated for tax purposes?
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:52:51
No cuz hoodle

looks like a bunch of shitty kickstarts

That's like saying a cent is the unit of trade rather than a dollar. Which exchanges have a quoted market value for satoshis?
@_date: 2017-09-27 05:44:06
Stick a fork in it.
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:33:38
even if you buy something with bitcoin, then you'll need to pay the capital gain (Fair value of whatever you bought - the purchase price of the bitcoin). Speaking only to the US. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:34:10
I'm not a tax professional, but here's my two cents:
If you don't really own Bitcoin and don't have real dominion over some quantity of it, and can't actually move it without everyone's say-so, what does that say about the "accession to wealth"?
Really? So you don't own the bitcoins in your wallet? They're the "communities"? C'mon dude that's just asinine. Taxable income requires: 1. Assession to wealth: bitcoin has a fair value greater than a dollar, therefore, when you mine bitcoin you have clear assession to wealth (yes, you could deduct certain mining expenses), 2. Realization: this is just a matter of timing of when the miner receives the bitcoin, 3. Complete domain: You are the only person who has access to your PRIVATE key to your bitcoin wallet (or at least I hope). You are free to transfer the bitcoin as you please. You have complete control. In regards to your hypothetical scenario, you would still have the private key to address the bitcoins are deposited to, so you'd still have control.
You could capitalize the mining equipment and assume a useful life of 5 years. So hypothetically if you mine 1 bitcoin (assuming market value of $3,900 at the time of the mining), then your taxable net profit would be 3,900 - (2,000/5) - any other expenses necessary to mine bitcoin.
Also, the whole "the number of private keys is limited, so technically everyone has access to every private key" has got to be the most retarded thing I have ever heard. That's like saying I don't own the money in my bank account because someone could guess my 4 digit debit card pin, therefore I don't have full control over the funds in my account. It's just stupid. I'd like to see you make that argument in front of the IRS lol. And honestly if all of your arguments were in fact true (you don't technically own your own bitcoin, everyone knows everyone's private key, and transactions are denied by the network regardless if the two parties agreed on it), then you wouldn't even have to worry about capital gains because your bitcoin would be worthless.
In regards to your last paragraph, you'd have to pay tax on the fair market value as distinguished in an active market not some random offer. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:49:46
I'm naturally skeptical. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 17:14:17
are you an idiot?
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:41:47
you're the man!
@_date: 2017-10-05 03:06:32
don't forget to pay any capital gains tax. r/becauseyoudbeinjail if you don't.

OP: Hey guys!! We should all commit tax evasion!! Here are some of my ideas! lets hustle yo!
IRS agents (including myself): thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:00:11
no, bitcoin is the unit of trade. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 05:36:27
That's bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:13:05
fine, lets just get rid of taxes all together.
Say goodbye to: national defense, public schools, social security, welfare programs, transportation infrastructure, NASA, etc.. Clearly you're the greedy one here.

bitcoin holders predict the price to increase dramatically. surprising.

he's more interested in Ethereum &amp; ICOs
@_date: 2017-10-05 03:17:39
The rates are not disclosed until after the transaction is complete. Their fees are almost 20%.
@_date: 2017-10-05 01:14:17
How so?

I am a part of a bitclub network group on fb. An admin posted this spreadsheet today. Can someone explain what the hell is going on in this spreadsheet?
