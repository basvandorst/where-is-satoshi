How is this gold shilling? This is a fact, central banks who are the heart of finance are going to destroy the worlds primary money... which interlinks crypto as something superior

I disagree, governments are very much in debt. Just look at how these interest rates hikes have hurt the U.S - servicing debt becomes more expensive! I still think all these countries just spur hyperinflation to wipe all their debt away

I agree with you, government debt will be pushed on citizens via taxation &amp; inflation. However, I think it’s irresponsible to say government debt is citizens debt. The general population doesn’t vote on the debt ceiling... the president and Congress makes that decision.

Smart, russia is adapting to the future... also they want to circumvent the US dollar ;)

No? This is about the dollar that competes with bitcoin... 
I thought this article laid out a compelling case why the dollar is losing its dominance: it provides objectives examples of how country's are circumventing the dollar

what are you even talking about? I am not shilling anything, this should describe to any rational bitcoin community member of why we got into this in the first place... 
centralized thinking benefits select few, while network suffers. Bitcoin = consensus... This quote addresses that in a way. I don't appreciate your comment.
