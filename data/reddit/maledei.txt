I also still have money on the closed polish account and hope that there will be some movement - although I kind of given up hope...

I deposited 500 e to bitcoin 24, they said it never showed up,  started ignoring my emails, 10 days later they were shut down.

Out of the blue, 500e
@_date: 2013-04-26 17:30:06
why should I?
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:36:41
Really? You would think their support would know about this...
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:00:46
thanks, it's not among them. The number I had starts with PL18

Same happened to me, but my bank said I should not even try to charge it back since it would be hopeless anyway.

That was apparently just before I sent €500 to their polish bank account. Great. I somehow doubt that I'll see my money again.
Fuck everything about this.

just saw that it was apparently the "polish authorities": 
Of course this was 10 days ago, so you might think that the support was somehow aware of it when they ignored my previous messages.
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:39:51
this is true
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:05:48
They already scammed me out of €500 last week, I don't think that i will ever see my money again.
@_date: 2013-04-26 17:17:41
there are none thus far. They said they are investigating, and would like me to come in for an interview, to learn more about bitcoin-24.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:05:35
thanks, that somehow makes it less painful :)

bank says, only chance I have is contest through a lawyer, in a different country, which would cost a lot more then I lost.
@_date: 2013-04-26 18:16:08
Yeah, not that keen on going there either
