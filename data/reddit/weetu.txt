*Ripple* charts?? For a bitcoin transfer?

I'd prefer "bitcoinaire".

Segwit2X has been cancelled. Note the 2X part. Google what it means.

As long as you keep your recovery word list safe, the longevity of the machine doesn't matter. You can always recover on another compatible wallet.

1) When you sold your BTC for USD on Coinbase, did you actually receive the USD in your Coinbase USD account?
2) Did you then actually transfer the USD to your bank?
As far as I know, those are two quite separate actions. The first one has nothing to do with your bank, the second has nothing to do with the blockchain, mempool etc...

OP is asking about Bitcoin Cash - its fork already happened.

How would you differentiate between bitcoins frozen/lost and bitcoins someone is just holding?

Clickbait title -&gt; not gonna click. If the news is noteworthy, it will attract viewers by putting the actual beef in the title.

Give it time. Bitcoin will be much stabler in 10 years.

Some have retronym:ed it as Hold On for Dear Life. But yeah, just hold on and you'll be fine.

If you want to know more about it, here's one example of what might happen to funds left on an exchange:

Yep, easy to achieve now, but the consensus seems to be that these are still the early days. If the price of bitcoin rises up to its potential, owning at least one full bitcoin could very well be a true achievement.

If you don't *transfer* your coins, the fork will not affect their safety in your wallet.

If you want to make money by owning bitcoin, there are two steps:
1. Get some bitcoin
2. Wait
Once you have waited long enough, the real-world value of your bitcoin (either its value compared to a fiat currency or its purchasing power) should be higher than when you got the bitcoin.
You do not need to do any repeated buying or selling - in fact, if you don't know what you're doing, buying and selling on the exchange is a good way to *lose* money.

Coinbase takes a much larger fee.

The thing is: After the fork there will be two blockchains. However, both chains have the same history. That means that if you owned bitcoins before the fork, you will own the same amount **on both chains** after the fork.
The interesting/challenging bit is that if you *do* something with those bitcoins on one chain, the same thing might happen to them also on the other chain (because of no replay protection, at least not both ways). So, after the fork you need to know what you're doing to do things safely.
So, in this regard Coinbase is not offering anything special. However, it seems that they will take care of replay protection, allowing you to transfer/spend your funds safely on both chains.

We have several HUNDREDS of these discussion threads about this exact same topic already. Why do we need another one?
