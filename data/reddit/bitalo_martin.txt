where are no labels?

We have discussed the 2FA mandatory or not issue for very long. But we decided that phone number is necessary because we require two factor authentification. Otherwise any trojan horse on your PC will undermine your security. If you do not want to use a phone number, we also support the MePIN app one click two factor from your smartphone, but from UI point of view we decided to have a phone number for everybody, unless we get a special request. Making 2FA optional would undermine the whole multi-signature user-side encryption security concept and it would not be more secure than a desktop wallet. You can also use simple online SMS receiver tools if you really want to not use your phone number.
You can also use our test account "testuser" and "Admin12345_" if you dont feel like signing up :-D

also, we decided to use JavaScript so that the user can actually follow what is going on. So that we indeed use user-side encrypted wallets based on multi-signature and not just "normal" wallets where you give up control over your coins. We still might have certain browser incompatibilites, because some old internet explorers or whatever simply dont work and we did not test all browsers in all versions of course.

bitalo has just launched an airbnb like service using bitcoin. Free listing and multi-signature escrow based on user-side encrypted HD multisig wallets.
and the airbnb module is available at: 
more info:
@_date: 2015-12-28 08:59:13
the airbnb code is fully operational. we just have no listing (except mine) at this point. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 09:00:48
first of all you can decide to rent out only to verified users. Users get ratings, then it is possible to request a collateral.
@_date: 2015-12-28 09:27:12
it pays according to your score
@_date: 2015-12-30 01:24:32
not even admins can access bitcoins, any changes on the code will lead to a complete server shutdown... security was highest priority, this is also why we require mandatory two factor authentification
@_date: 2014-11-06 13:58:30
also we have a regular bug bounty, a ddos is not a bug-fix.
@_date: 2014-11-06 13:34:26
I am very sorry, but this is bullshit. If it was just us being attacked, ok, fair enough, lets ignore it, but the guy has a history and is threatening every other service. We do not accept that anyone is "offering services" with simply starting DDOS on various services.
@_date: 2014-07-02 23:37:43
thanks :-)
@_date: 2014-05-04 14:08:27
Sure, but green address is a wallet service, no exchange.
@_date: 2014-05-04 14:05:04
yes sorry, i forgot to put the link to the presentation. I added it now
@_date: 2014-07-03 00:54:48
Because google authenticator is not secure, see localbitcoins.com where they had incidents of stolen coins despite of two factor.
When the computer is already compromised the hacker can potentially get the setup key for the two factor. MePIN works directly on the device.
We will support other two factor methods soon, such as SMS verification.
@_date: 2014-07-06 23:30:54
Forgot to mention recovery transaction where you can recover your bitcoins even when the site goes completely offline
@_date: 2014-05-04 14:03:03
indeed. Practically impossible.
@_date: 2014-05-04 14:04:27
there are differences in particular with the two-factor authentication where Bitalo is more secure, as you can set it up on a fully compromised computer. Also I do not know any exchange service that has implemented this comcept
@_date: 2014-12-09 01:29:58
Bitalo.com is happy to take over all german customers. No verification needed for selling coins, multi-signature escrow and big revamp of website, including launch of product marketplace coming soon.
@_date: 2014-05-04 14:05:53
I wish all kind of services would use this or a similar concept. Then disasters like mtgox would never happen again.
@_date: 2014-11-06 13:34:51
this is what we did
@_date: 2015-05-25 23:42:46
sorry, this is really bullshit. :-) A free society without the monopolized state-run court system with "responsibilities" etc. would solve this kind of conflict (where it is OBVIOUS who is right and that they forged documents and refuse payments etc.) in just a few days via DROs
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:02:33
have you heard about Bitalo?
They will offer p2p exchange, marketplace, travel/lodging, predictions, academy all in highly secure multi-signature environment with user-side encrypted keys, multi-sig escrow and backup transactions so that you get coins back even when the site goes completely offline.
And best part: all is free without any strange pre-sale of "tickets"
@_date: 2015-01-10 19:54:03
 uses Multi-Signature in the most possible secure way. Not even the service provider has access to the bitcoins.
Private keys are generated user-side in the user's browser, are fully encrypted and stored only in encrypted form. Bitalo also supports a pre-signed backup transaction where you get your coins back, even when the service is completely offline or the complete database was erased.
As we have mandatory two-factor authentication via SMS or MePIN you can even setup a wallet on a fully compromised computer and you never risk to lose any bitcoins.
We are currently working on a fully integrated services and a major user interface upgrade will come soon
@_date: 2015-05-25 23:55:11


and where is even the very very simple communication about why they would want to add another paragraph etc.
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:57:23
ah, now i understand why the tickets are needed. ok i will definitely follow your launch next week
@_date: 2016-01-01 22:32:46
you should look into Bitalo (enter.bitalo.com), that uses user-side encrypted multi-signature wallets with backup transactions. It is not without third party, but the third party can only access coins in case of a dispute
@_date: 2015-03-12 10:47:35
ok, where are the coins stored AFTER selling a product? You have internal wallet or user needs his own wallet?
@_date: 2015-03-09 07:36:56
Bitalo will launch an integrated marketplace at  based on user-side encrypted multi-signature wallets where coins can never be lost or stolen, simply because admins never get control, unless there is an escrow case. We still need to fix a bug in the bitcore API, but we hope that we can launch it soon.
@_date: 2015-03-12 07:50:04
Regarding security, when your PC is hacked you can lose the coins or do you have some sort of two-factor?
@_date: 2015-02-16 01:21:23
cold wallet is always just a compromise.Many things can go wrong, starting from key creation and it also does not prevent any inside jobs. The only solution to this problem are user-side encrypted keys in multi-signature wallets, like implemented on  In this case no one, not even site administrators have access to the bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:13:35


while the technology works well already, the UI is still very bad. But we are preparing an update that will come hopefully in a month.. :-) many greetings - Martin
