So when do I buy?
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:29:33
Yes. I thought he was being serious.
@_date: 2018-09-15 18:03:03
It has those requirements if it is going to be anything but a chatroom with extra steps.

....but bitcoin isn't backed by anything...hah. Buy Buy Buy Buy!

There are thirteen digits in the image.
Hint: 7 is a lucky number.

This is sleek.

Lol, this is one of the most upvoted posts

Did you ever think that the 1% deserve their money?
@_date: 2015-01-23 17:39:03
bitcoiners for the most part want to see the government die.

I think this is awesome! It is massively more significant than a diamond and demonstrates the magnificence of human ingenuity. It reminds me of the bracelet made of the first draft of Rearden Metal that Dagney negotiated away from Rearden's wife in Atlas Shrugged.

Nice. I like their choice of company stock and index funds.

I have not seen voat before despite several searches looking for alternatives to reddit. I just sent them some bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:17:31
The thing is that bitcoin is not localized, so "paying directly from the foreign entity" really means nothing. Governments love the concept of banks because it means that they can finitely judge that money has passed through their borders, but with bitcoin I am unsure of the legality.

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Anyone...anyone? I doubt Ross has a daughter to pull him out of insanity after his release.
@_date: 2015-07-11 18:39:10
How do you reliably buy and sell bitcoin. Do you sell it in your own markets or do you use a 3rd party market?
@_date: 2015-07-15 08:54:58
This only applies if I am going to take income from the company as personal income right? If I were to initiate transactions from the company account directly to suppliers or from customers, then these taxes would not apply? I am not concerned with personally evading taxes. I just don't my fledgeling corporation to be destroyed with insane corporate tax.
@_date: 2015-07-11 18:42:04


What does that even mean? That is like saying: I just got off the phone the the CEO of the internet.
@_date: 2015-07-15 03:41:56
Except it hurts all the parasites deriving income from the form of slavery we call taxation.
@_date: 2015-07-12 02:46:40
I thought this was on all and not on front. I was like OMU, they are beginning to understand!!

No one for president!

Weird. I just bought in today. I extrapolated the prebubble curve and 7k looked about correct.
Also, look at the US markets. When they go down, BTC will rise (assuming people who know the real use case for BTC has enough money to buy more)
@_date: 2015-09-22 22:03:48
The entire government is a racket.
@_date: 2015-09-22 22:12:36
You know it costs 20,000$ dollars to challenge a patent that has been granted. It will cost more if you go to court.
@_date: 2015-09-20 19:19:07
That makes much more sense. The password could just be used as the salt then.
@_date: 2015-09-14 00:35:53
It will not be destroyed.
@_date: 2015-09-14 10:31:26
Redundant engraved jewlery might be effective to prevent this mishap.
@_date: 2015-09-14 09:46:22
That is quite permanent. Now you have metal money. Engrave it into gold, and noone would be able to properly evaluate your gold!
@_date: 2015-09-14 09:48:48
Yes, but that's just 4 digits. I like theg16's idea about engraving it into semi-indestructible metal.
@_date: 2015-09-29 01:01:07
I like this alot. Thanks.

It seems so easy to keep a brain wallet these days with the electrum seed.
@_date: 2015-09-14 00:38:35
Which is why you won't become rich by saving the world from the tyranny of centralized government and socialism.
@_date: 2015-09-22 21:54:24
Coinbase is a corporation. Even if the CEO doesn't the corp does. It is like asking Obama if he intends to use the patriot act.
@_date: 2015-09-14 00:35:07
There is no way the government could tax it if used properly.
@_date: 2015-09-14 00:33:41
Our brains need a defense system against men with guns. I don't know why the people living in the early 20th century didn't see what they were getting themselves into here in America.

!!!!...Satoshi is the non fictional version of John Galt
@_date: 2015-09-15 03:32:08
I have heard of cracking brain wallets, but not of the specific software. BrainFlayer is a catchy name for something that does that. I just looked at the source and the video. Apparently it brute forces unsalted phrases hashed to private keys. That is pretty cool!! Wow, the stupidity of some of these passwords. "one two three four five six seven" was used!
@_date: 2015-09-22 22:09:02
This is like asking for the government not to be broken.
@_date: 2015-09-20 19:04:43
Super Cool! The private key is the URL. I bet if I put one of my wallets private keys into the URL it would load up my cash! Perhaps not though, because I don't know how the passwords work. They would be completely irrelevant if you could just take a password protected url and then plug it into other wallet software.
@_date: 2015-09-20 19:18:00
Lol. When all it takes is a [URL]( to send and receive BTC, how do we expect people to enforce this?
@_date: 2015-09-14 09:42:59
Great. I am still not brave enough to go cold storage but I did move everything off of coinbase.

It costs 20,000$ do so. I have been thinking about doing it for Disney's BB-8 patent that they stole from Randall of XKCD
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:32:28
Like this. Hacking the internet. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:58:48
Can someone explain the context behind this for those out of the loop?
@_date: 2015-03-19 22:27:22
Wana go in at it together? offered 2btc as well whuch means we could split 4. I like working alone, but I wouldn't want to try beating you out for this.
@_date: 2015-02-07 23:14:31
I was confused. I was wondering how you could have floating BTC since all data is kept as fluxes in and out of accounts. I get it now though.
@_date: 2017-07-16 02:15:09
If I had bitcoin, I would hold. I bought a 3d printer with my coin. I also paid a graphic designer on the other side of the globe in coin. I wish indiegogo worked in coin so I wouldn't have to wait 2 fucking weeks to get my money due to banking issues.
