I tried verifying Electrum with the info in the OP, but it didn't work.
I got a notification in yellow mentioning **Animazing's** key ID.
So I imported Animazing's PGP Public Key found at  and verified the setup file in GPG4Win with his signature:




This worked as I got a green box with a message saying the signature is valid.
However, I'm completely new to GPG and all that, so can someone confirm if I used the correct info? Thanks.

Superb ebook! I went from being a complete Bitcoin newbie to owning a tiny bit of Bitcoin in my Electrum wallet.
Some thoughts:
* On page 72, when we are creating an Electrum wallet for the first time, it says to click "OK" on the Server screen even though we are offline. This made the connection hang and when I canceled the connection, the public addresses didn't show up in my Wallet. I then restarted the OS (yes, I'm a Ubuntu noob as well!) and created a new, working wallet by pressing "cancel" this time
* I read this book because I want the ultimate security for my investments/finances. Since I don't know much about Ubuntu, I was stuck on page 67 for a long time. It wasn't because the instructions weren't crystal clear (it was), but I had no idea what those commands did. I Googled each line before I was satisfied. I know you're trying to minimize the technical mumbo jumbo from your book, but it would be great if you could briefly explain what each command does for suspicious people like me!
* About those commands again: apparently it downloads an older version of Electrum. Can you tell me how to write a command to download the latest release straight from the Electrum site, but of course without installing it?
* I read somewhere that if we are going to share a USB drive between online and offline operating systems, we should disable AutoRun to be on the safe side. Is this your thought as well? As a total noob, how is Ubuntu safe out of the box to use without installing stuff like antivirus, firewall, etc. before connecting to the internet?
* When I first read page 65, I was unclear how to boot Ubuntu because it said: "you *may* need to select an option like 'Try Ubuntu without installing.'" I had to read the rest of the instructions to conclude that this is what we *should* do every single time... Or am I wrong? 
* Is there some way to incorporate the python + Electrum files into the bootable USB drive so it doesn't need to be installed each time we log into Ubuntu? 
* I'm still quite new to everything so I'm wondering: should I view my private key when offline in Ubuntu, write it down, and lock it up somewhere safe? Or should I never find out what it is if I don't plan on using a different wallet?
