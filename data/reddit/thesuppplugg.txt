Do a search on reddit and you'll find hoards of people who forgot those easy to remember passwords
@_date: 2019-06-03 17:28:52
You've never forgotten a phone number of someone you call all the time? Never forgotten an email password if you don't login often? Personally I'm not willing to put my funds in the hands of my memory.

Its only 5k and some change, start a side hustle, start affiliate marketing in the crypto space getting paid out in BTC, lots of ways to get there.

I think it's very important for the BTC and Cryptocurrency to not fall prety to this circle jerk talk of how Bitcoin and crypto is better than everything else. 
The fact is for something to get mainstream adoption it has to be 10x better whether that be more convenient, cheaper, easier to use, more features. 
Crypto has amazing potential. I come from the world of "high risk merchant processing" where its almost impossible to get processing and if you do it's 7% or higher" so I can really see the value.
All that said for your average transaction credit cards or paypal are easier to use, people are used to them, the fees are in line with or comparable to crypto. Nobody really cares about saving 1.5% to 3% on processing fees, that's not enough to get someone to change their behavior.
I do finally see some things being done to make crypto more usable, however at the end of the day something like a coinbase linked credit card isn't really making crypto more usable, it still has the Visa/MC logo on it, your still subject to their terms, its still centralized and not private. I suppose its a start though

If your dad can do it not anyone can, I know plenty of dumb people who wouldn't know how to use cashapp.

These types of discussions are somewhat disingenuous. Paypal is easier to use and has less problems with downtime than crypto and crypto exchanges. Crypto has use cases but when we try to make it seem as if it's easier or better than what are currently superior payment options it's not really a great argument. A good one is Bitcoin doesn't freeze your account and hold your money for 6 months with no way to find out why.

Yeah good point. I think he just meant Bitcoin woudln't be where it was today if there wasn't some transacting early on and at the time the value was what it was. What's the point in looking back to the past.

I completely agree, your 1000x more likely to forget your password passphrase than it woudl be for someone to get physical control over your device and/or your seed.

The government can really do whatever they wanna do, they've siezed gold, I wouldn't put it past them to try to crack down on bitcoin anything is possible. Not likely though and it wouldn't really be feasible to do

Bitcoin is rigged by printing of tether, were becomming what we hate
@_date: 2019-05-01 16:57:10
I was under the impresssion those aren't settled in bitcoin so aside from bitcoin markets looking to those markets they really shouldn't have an effect

Historically speaking I'm correct, your making assumptions about the future, only time will tell
@_date: 2019-05-21 13:06:49
Yeah I think it's going to be a slow adoption as people get more exposure. Maybe 60 minutes doesn't do it but maybe the next media portrayal does
@_date: 2019-05-21 17:12:45
Your going to pay out the ass to not be on paper
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:34:06
I wouldn't trust that, I get brain farts all the time, I forget email passwords if I don't login after a while
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:32:18
You can write your seed hidden on a picture, on a piece of artwork, broken up onto several pieces of paper spread various places, in a bank deposit box.

Yeah he's got a big presence on CNN and other media sites and such. Maybe he'll get interested and do some additional follow up pieces.

I was on his boat

These types of posts are so dumb. First off I'd bet a good portion of crypto investors also invest in real estate, the stock market, etc, I know I do. I'm not hoping for the stock market to crash and honestly if it did crypto would do worse so I wouldn't cheer these types of things. A good economy all around is good for crypto and investing in stocks is smart not dumb. Also crypto lost like 3000% last year so we have no room to talk

I agree, I think most people expected either a hit piece or a glowing 60 minute commercial telling people to buy Bitcoin. I thought it was as good as could be expected.
It wasn't a hit piece, there was no mention of Tulips or Bean Babies. I agree it was kind of short at 13 minutes and I agree nothing was really mentioned in terms of positive things happening in 2019 and institutional involvement, but overall I thought it was a basic intro to Bitcoin and about as good as we could have expected.
@_date: 2019-05-09 14:05:29
Absolutely won't. Short of the government seizing peoples money like Greece/Malta etc where I agree people may throw money into crypto when the economy is down and stocks are down crypto will go down worse
