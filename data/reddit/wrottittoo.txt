They get 100% of their fiat value back.
@_date: 2015-06-09 05:15:56
Absolutely! That's why the cash back credit cards are so popular.
Discover for 5% cash back at restaurants (this quarter), BankAmericard VISA for 3% cash back at gas stations and Citi Mastercard for 2% cash back on every thing else.
When you pay everything with credit cards, it adds up nicely. 
It's free money, why wouldn't you take it.

How did you get that? Was there only two main frequencies?
Could those just be zeros and ones? (Or ones and zeros...)
The narrowest pulse tels you how wide a bit is.
Then, if there are 256 bits, that could be a private key.
(Private keys can also be shorter, I forget how much, as some of the bits are redundant or discarded.)
If not, does it look like ASCII encoded data?
With or without start and stop bits and/or parity (up to 10 bits per byte).
Or maybe it's 8B10B encoded? 
It doesn't look like how I imagine Manchester encoded data would look like.
I'll take 10% of the loot, if any of these ideas leads to a solution. :-)

I'd say you've got that backwards.
It's still peer-to-peer: anyone can send coins to anyone else directly with no intermediary.
But it is getting centralized: only a few mining pools work to record the transaction into the ledger.

If the average people managed to move from (640) kilobytes to megabytes and gigabytes (not to mention 1.21 gigawatts), I think they'll be able to move to from BTC to mBTC to µBTC when/if it becomes necessary. 
A lot of people are comfortable with two decimals in there money and dealing with values of less than 0.01 mBTC (less than half a USD cent) is really not necessary at this point.
Canada has even already dropped the 1¢ coin and rounds to the nearest nickel (5¢).

Every body who buys a new mobile phone or data plan has some understanding of gigabytes.
Everybody who has an Internet service provider knows about megabits per seconds.
That covers pretty much everybody who will be able to use bitcoins.
Everybody outside the USA understands the difference between millimeter, meter and kilometer.

4) spend the coins as exaggerated transactions fees to keep enough miners interested should the natural increase in transaction fees be insufficient to compensate for the reward halving.

Another great example of why the use of "bit" for µBTC should be banned.
It seems here that by "millibit", the author meant "millibitcoin"($300/1000 = 30 cents, too high a threshold for dust IMO BTW now that tipping is becoming common), but because "bit" is now unfortunately commonly used to mean µBTC, we think he means 1/1000th of a µBTC or 1 nBTC, which is smaller than the current atom.

Do you know how to build a pdf from the asciidoc source?
docbook2pdf -h doesn't give me enough clues.
Edit: OK I figured out that I have to use asciidoc, not (or before?) docbook, but I still don't know how to get a pdf, and in particular, how to merge the whole book into a single pdf.
Edit2: I managed to generate a pdf with the following procedure. There are still some formatting issues, especially when there are long addresses that are too wide for the page, but it is usable.
* Edit book.asciidoc to remove the last line as colo.asciidoc is absent from the repository.
* Run the following commands

The cool part is if you put it in a Roth IRA, you can take it out tax free at retirement.

Or, we could just agree to recycle coins that are known to be lost.
It's just software, if more than %50 of the miners agree we can change anything in the protocol.
I don't think it would be that hard to convince the miners that any coin that hasn't moved in 10? 20? years is fare game for recycling.
If transactions fees don't increase enough to make mining profitable when the reward drops below, say, 1BTC, recycling "dead" coins might be the best way to keep the network alive.

FPGAs are NOT just microcontrollers. 
Some have hard processors on board and you can implement soft processors in most of them, but they are way more that "just microcontrollers".
As for security, it varies significantly from family to family. 
From the basic, low cost, no protection whatsoever version, to the FPGAs with encrypted bit steam and designed specifically for military applications with support for red/black separation.
@_date: 2015-04-22 05:41:36
FPGAs come in sizes that vary in at least a 1000 to 1 ratio, so seeing them used in completely different applications isn't really surprisings.

Opening port 8333 doesn't make any difference as I keep the number of peers connected to 8 anyways.
But obviously, if you do not limit the number of peers and do not cap the bandwidth, your bitcoin client will eventually use up all your bandwidth or all your CPU power, whatever ends up being the bottleneck. 
8 peers is plenty to get reasonably fast updates and a reasonable diversity of sources and neither my CPU, nor my memory, nor my bandwidth are strained.
@_date: 2017-07-16 07:17:46
Miners, exchanges, merchants and other Bitcoin businesses need high performance nodes, and make a lot of money from them so they contribute a lot of the required bandwidth, but they are in limited numbers, and will always be, regardless of block size, so they are somewhat centralized. Decentralization will only come from volunteers running lower performance nodes on lower cost hardware and with lower bandwidth. All that I am saying is that those nodes would not be affected much by block size increases. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 07:34:58
At least blockchain.info seems to do its share with connections to over 1800 nodes: 
I don't have any hard evidence for other members of the Bitcoin "economic majority", but 
Miners want to know about the highest paying transactions and new blocks ASAP so must likely have big fast nodes.
The bigger a merchant gets the bigger its IT infrastructure, they certainly don't want to lose sales because transactions failed to reach them in time so they probably also invest more than a couple $100 in their node hardware and bandwidth.
@_date: 2017-05-24 04:39:34

The fact that higher performance nodes *can* support a larger number of connections and higher traffic, doesn't mean that low performance node can't still function perfectly well as decentralized repositories of the blockchain and transaction checkers and forwarders. 
My node keeps up with the network and keeps my copy of the blockchain up to date without breaking a sweat (and without breaking my ISP's data limit). 
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:00:22
My understanding is that a non-SegWit-aware node will not understand the Witness section of the block, but it will still be able to verify the block (otherwise the "soft" fork would cause a chain split) and the "anyone can spend" transaction will look normal, and spendable.


How is that different from a hard fork?
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:00:21


It *allows* users to do that, but does it *prevent* malicious users from creating hard to verify transactions?
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:08:38


That's interesting. 
There must be some kind of truth under the "anyone can spend" appellation, otherwise it wouldn't have stuck around for so long. Where does it come from?
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:34:54
An "anyone can spend" transaction is a gift to the first taker.
Edit: Most of the harm comes to the miner who could be another party completely unaware of anything other than the transaction is perfectly valid.
