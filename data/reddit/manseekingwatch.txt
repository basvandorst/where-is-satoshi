"Oh man, I sure wish I could've explicitly timed this asset/security using Future Vision™. Too bad I didn't and just kept all my money and continued to execute a safe and effective investment strategy." - people who retire with enough money to live on.
Keep doing you.

This kind of attitude is so remarkably stupid on a sub devoted to Bitcoin that I don't even know what to say.
Holy shit, the irony.

It's not really appreciating though, is it?
I got out at around 10,000 on the way down from the ATH. I bought a ludicrously expensive diamond ring, and put a down payment on a condo. The diamond has kept its value and the condo has appreciated massively in the same time the Bitcoin has halved.

I think you missed mine, actually, but OK champ.
Keep up the good work not speculating. ��

And in a non-bitcoin future, you will say "hey kids, I sold this imaginary thing on the internet to buy something before it tanked."
The idea that Bitcoin is going to make everyone with 10 BTC into millionaires while the rest of the economy stagnates is comical.
You had your chance for orders of magnitude gains. It's gone now. Best case is that it teases like a regular asset and you see returns like you might on reasonably good tech stocks. Worst case is that enthusiasm slowly bleeds out as sophisticated syndicates dump their BTC on unsuspecting retail investors who still think this is happening.

Possibly the worst investing advice imaginable.

Diamonds are some of the best conspicuous consumption money can buy, tbh. For that matter, my Rolex keeps shittier time than a $20 Casio, but people are impressed by it at dinner parties.
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:06:15
Bitcoin and diamonds have a lot of similarities, frankly.
@_date: 2019-04-02 13:16:46
Look at the optimism in this thread too. A single massive upswing on a single trade that appears to have magically stuck to a level that is still like 25% of ATH and people are throwing up their hallelujahs.
All this moron technical analysis... Greater fool indeed.

Anyone who tells you they know why is an imbecile and should be disregarded.
That short theory, for example, is hysterical, and definitely not someone with any training, experience, or common sense.
Daily movements are rarely explicable in even very well understood asset classes, of which crpyto is surely not one.

So... You're agreeing with him? Or just poorly informed?
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:05:23
Or it might be an extremely good decision. Double the income, positive tax implications, etc.

How the fuck do you guys not have spell check in rural Alabama yet.

With how widespread BTC is now, do you really imagine that the millions of people who have some will all suddenly be catapulted into wealth beyond avarice just because they've got BTC? How would that even work? 5% of the country will suddenly become 0.1%ers? And the economy won't adjust at all?
@_date: 2019-04-02 13:02:50
Pretty much everyone who isn't organized crime is in it to pay off debt. It explains the culture of sound financial judgment around amateur crypto investing.
@_date: 2019-04-02 13:00:42
The movement of it is so hysterically artificial. Up several hundred on a single trade.
Why do you continue to waste time on this? There are literally zero applicable business cases, and Ma and Pa Investor have been burned so bad they're never coming back.
@_date: 2018-11-23 09:17:43
It doesn't do this now and would not even in the use case everyone here is imagining. Wtf are you talking about and who upvoted this.
@_date: 2018-11-23 09:16:36
This has literally nothing to do with Bitcoin and is not a problem Bitcoin or the blockchain can solve. Why is this here.
@_date: 2019-04-02 13:01:26
This doesn't even ascend to the level of technical analysis.
Wtf are you talking about.

The day that fiat is useless, you needs guns, not Bitcoin.

I would not have said anything except for how smug this post is. You do NOT look like the smarter of the two parties in this conversation. Go back and edit or delete all of it for your own good.
@_date: 2019-05-30 19:53:56
Neither? Why would I hold any non-productive asset.
@_date: 2019-05-31 00:02:02
Retarded analogy. Like saying that winking lottery tickets are a good investment.
@_date: 2019-05-30 19:48:43
It's non-productive and has pretty standard risk adjusted returns. Anyone who thinks they have enough information to conclusively say it is better than every other asset is a fool with no risk plan who will shortly be parted from his money if things don't break exactly his way.
