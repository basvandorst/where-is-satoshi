i read.
My question is more about how the trust system works or build? How the company keep the security level same as btc?
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:00:12
longest waiting time could be half an hour
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:13:45
what if the hr “anonymously” stole all the money? And claim it's hacked?
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:09:03
why not search on reddit and filtered by posted time？
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:09:56
what curious me is that is it a single person hold the private key or a group of people. how these people trust each other? E.g. insider memorize private key and stole the money, or have third party keep their money? All doesn't make sense to me.
I imagine a smart contract in the future cold help, but we don't have it yet?
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:08:38
any updates now？ i check the Twitter and github, seems there are lots of updates going on, but I'm not sure what are the big ones.
There are rumors about like LN would be "Testing" forever. Since the earliest paper about it published in 2015, I'm not sure 2 years would be too long to wait.

cause richs get richer. might have other ways to solve, but my research stops here.
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:30:21
any example how to manipulate？
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:25:41
I would highly suspect, Mayun has spoken to public that he is not familar with bitcoin. And to be honest, bitcoin is kind of invade his interest in AliPay.
*Alipay is a centralized payment system for Alibaba.

don't  like that this is faked.
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:10:30
and their exists a mechanism where if one of them died, there is still ways to withdraw the money? And at the same time, if the person doesn't die, their is a way to retrieve the money back?
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:30:01
if i remember correctly, first paper talk about LN is 2015. Explain it.

thx bro, marked down.
Already envision one day where multiple coins co-exists with fluent transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:35:47
lol, of course not
Just curious about how would big money get involve 
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:00:11
current 1mb takes 30 seconds for all nodes to makes a consensus on a newly mined block. 64mb means it would take about 30 minutes, while each 10 minutes a new block will be created. Meaning slow miners will always keep confirming others' block and could not mine - leading to centralization.
Pleaz do ur research.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:22:15
how？any further explanation？ i assume all shorting corresponds to a boosting, can't see how to manipulate 
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:22:52
It's semi-anonymous as far as i know.
Let's say:
1) the hr bought a new iPhone,
2)create a  wallet, 
3) generate a address for receiving
4) "Steal"
5) do nothing else, or buy ticket to Europe 
6) find a way to withdraw the money 
Any problem for this strategy?
Assume one can steal 1000 btc, it's huge amount right?

thx for joining discussion, just for reminding, it's not about Chinese or western, it's about miners and users. It just happen to be that the electricity price is comparatively low that makes China a centralized mining place. 
I regard this as a social level attack beyond what crypto could do, and BTC need to build a level of security on this. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:11:16
That's exactly what i couldn't understand, what's price multipler? thx ahead for explanation
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:13:27
and transactions are pending :(
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:56:16
I m a Chinese citizen, and the reason I translate this is not to hear f**k China. There are enormous people  who were cheated by ICO because of their ignorance, and I don't think those innocent people should be blamed by you and anyone else. Nore do i see a future that 1.4 billion people would be excluded from "A world wide centralized trust network."
Remind your words, please.
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:11:32
sounds crazy, but seems like someone undertand cryptocurrency better than me...
What's more, what coinbase announce worries me. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:56:17
It's probably a dreaming, but as long as someone "dreams' it to happen, why wouldn't a profit holder (The centralized miner) think about this. 
I think this is a great chance to see whether if 51% attack really works.
Ps: this might not be a so-called 51% attack, but to my understanding, it's similar. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:59:19
thank you for ur sharing. Makes me have larger picture on it. :D
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:01:31
your words makes me feel better. (Will be great if you could explain why u think so, cause i'm not the only one who don't know economics and game theory)
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:12:36
and i guess its happening？
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:29:07
typo, * decentralized
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:51:44
correct me if  im wrong. Why  the img here shows a price higher than 10k in 2014?
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:01:17
I've just posted a relevant post. As a newbie, i want to know what if few hash power works in btc, while at the same time, lots  of miners starts to  do 2X minging? Futher, what would happen if coinbase claim that they accept 2X as BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:34:25
thx for writing it. 
If it's real, we can see for the first time how 51% hashrate attack could works, (If i understand it correctly), and anything similar happened would be that few years ago when a database bug occured.
great to witness what would happen
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:09:56
There are lots of Chinese against B2X. Those who support it are either 1)"Fake users" of Jihan's intrest group, or 2) they didn't realize increasing block size isn't the way to upgrade the parallel distributed bank system, aka BTC, or 3) mislead by those fake users and believe segwit2x is an update before we could implement lightning network rather than a hastle attack.
i was in group 3, but fortunately i understand English and I can form my understanding based on multiple resources. till now i am still hesitate to full invest my quota into BTC  because of the comming hard fork. What about those who don't know English, all they get are second hand resources (Some early versions are even translate by jihan's interest group).
It would be better if you could understand the ecosystem of crypto currency in China. I bet when us 1.4 billion people join in, lots of things would change.
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:10:06
I have no idea whether if the attack could works (In theory or in reality orz). Would be great if more brains think about it.
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:55:20
Then it's Chinese miners' fault, you can piss whatever on them, but not Chinese.
Think of Coinbase's anouncement, it basically supports the one with higher hashrate, meaning 2x. It's a US company, should I also fk US residents?
Poison pills are all over the places, and those doesn't kill BTC makes it stronger. Ignorance itself is a poison pill, and one of the duty for BTC community is to educate those people. What you did helps nothing.
And to be honest, the more readers like you, the less passion for me to translate similar posts.
