not really qualified to say what's a substantial amount.  I'll just say I have a "few".  While I'm mostly hodling I do still want the ability to sell some off occaisionally if I feel like it.

That's definitely a lot to take in, I need to do a lot more research I think.  Thanks for your help!
Btw my family is from St. Paul, and I am up in Lake Superior every summer on the islands.  Love that area!

I'm considering selling the power for sure, but the space cost is a moot point.  I plan on utilizing 800 sq ft or so for my own office, and the space I'll be using has 25 ft ceilings so I could just loft the machines up there.
Sorry if I'm a newbie but I don't follow - is there something wrong with antminer machines or something?

Thank you this is really helpful!  I will consider the heat issue.

yeah i'm definitely finding out it's not that easy to nail down exactly what I could generate.  Still, even a ballpark figure would be helpful.  I feel like with free energy and free real estate this could be profitable.  I have the capital to invest in a significant amount of machines and I THINK my solar array can power about 40 of the antminer s7's (though not even sure if those are efficient anymore??).

Very informative - thank you so much for taking the time to type that out.  If it's not too personal of a question - what general area are you from?  I'm buying the building in Norwalk, CT and looking for a partner - someone to do all the work basically while I provide the capital and infrastructure.  I'd either pay a salary or a share in the profits...

That was a little nuts... for future reference can someone point out to me the most up to date and accurate price tracking for bitcoin?  Coinbase was showing 8100 at one point but maybe that was their own error because I see nothing saying it ever dipped below 9000...

Ah I see - ok I was looking at the ant miner s7 or s9 originally and just saw that on their site...

your reply makes me aware that I have a lot to learn about it - just thought there was one price!!!
btw random question - do you know anything about mining?  I'm buying a building with a 250 panel solar array already installed that generates 50kwh...  wondering how many machines I could power with that and how much I could mine.  No worries if you don't know just figured I'd ask.
