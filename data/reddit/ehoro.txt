Not sure how often this happen but your post scared me enough, moved my btc off of cex and onto a mycelium wallet. Confirmed and done in under 15mins. Seems to be just issues with trying to take cash out??

Once upon a  time maybe, but when it comes to scalpers have an army of bots buying tickets the second they become available it's dishonest to say they're not taking away the opportunity to buy the tickets from even attentive consumers.

Except if it's worth nothing why own a bunch of it? Eventually they'll want value out of it, or they're just destroying it for incremental fiat gains.

It's tough though, it costs me money to turn my fiat into crypto, and then if I buy things with crypto it's valued according to what it trades for fiat so I just lose out on turning my money into crypto. Unless I was paid in crypto and could spend all my crypto for living expenses it doesn't make sense to use it for regular purchases :/

Then there's nothing to worry about. It'd a down trend for crypto, I'd only be worried if it was happening to btc alone, blockchain/cryptos aren't going away and aren't going to die.

I get what you're saying, but are other coins breaking this trend or is this crypto market wide?

You've never heard or seen a good law passed??? Like laws against abestos? Or dumping of toxic wast?
