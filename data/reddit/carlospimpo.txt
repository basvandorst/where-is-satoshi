@_date: 2016-08-23 16:21:13
why doesn't it work when I use your .onion?
@_date: 2016-08-23 14:52:57
@_date: 2016-08-23 15:56:49
installed! Thanks for the tip.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:31:53
no,  you aren't. You give us liquidity and I appreciate it.

circle is now cheaper every time i check, as opposed to only sometimes like it used to be.
@_date: 2016-08-16 18:12:14
circle, local bitcoins, anywhere but coinbase. More legitimate places will require you to provide information regarding how you acquire the bitcoins to be sold however.
@_date: 2016-08-01 16:50:19
coinbase shouldn't call it instant if it's not. Having the timer expire on a payment window is hardly FUD.

look who wandered out of @_date: 2016-08-01 15:51:30
yeah thats all well and good, but I don't use you as a wallet. My outbound delays are happening after I complete a purchase and immediately get my funds out (as I always do). Don't call it instant if it isn't.

and is a loser
@_date: 2016-06-16 19:53:26
none. this is my alt account (obviously)
@_date: 2016-06-22 12:20:37
cause I paid a higher fee than you for my transactions
@_date: 2016-02-23 16:53:15
are you serious? you used to be able to double spend on the blockchain.info wallet if you forced zero fee and waited 12 hours for it to go back into your wallet. Free reddit gold was cake.

shapeshift.io is screwing their employees?
@_date: 2016-05-26 18:30:51

because you receive a gift receipt with your order, returns are issued in amazon credit to the person who returned it. Not the person who gifted it.

Wooks will never learn how to buy bitcoin. They don't even get jobs.
@_date: 2016-07-25 19:17:08
that goes to the miners.
@_date: 2016-07-26 14:05:09
