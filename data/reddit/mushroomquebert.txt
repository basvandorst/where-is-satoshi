No idea. What i'm trying to say is that you want to take Bitcoin and then create something on top that sounds like a bank because you realize Bitcoin is pretty much unusable in this situation. 
It just doesn't make much sense. Bitcoin is not the solution in this story. It's that simple.

Maybe you people should stop advising to buy coins. Pretty much everyone here who took this advise since jan last year got burned. 
People here were advising to buy at 1200 and every price since then.

You have a lot of rage and entitlement going on.

He is indeed full of shit. He sounds like a raging junkie blaming everyone and everything for his own mistakes.

I get it. I think such a service already exists. They're called banks.

Because what exactly will happen in 5 or 10 years?

Dude, poor people are not gonna risk putting the little money they have in a difficult internet money system that can crash at any moment. And they also don't have the equipment nor knowledge to do that. 
And the same for the rich. They will not put their money in an internet coin that lost 70% of its value in the last 15 months. 
This is such basic, logical and rational thinking. Why do Bitcoiners have so much trouble with that?
Jesus, why can't we ever have a normal discussion here without downvoting the hell out of every reply you don't like? Stop abusing the voting system! This is not what it there for. Grow up. Learn to handle different views without trying to censor the other person. 
The worst part is that the downvoters don't even point out where exactly i'm wrong. At least have the courtesy to do that when you try to censor me.

Because he's full of himself and does as he pleases. When things go wrong he will blame everyone but himself.
