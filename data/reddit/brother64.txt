It is not fair of you to say this. I am no fan of BitcoinCash and I don't like it, but many people are and Coinbase are just delivering on a promise and a logical market product. They should not be shamed for doing that, more importantly they should add much more coins.

 The video is awesome! It is absolutely true that Bitcoin cannot integrate in the current economy, all the world economy is based on the notion of expanding and for that we need spending and inflation. The thing is there is no room for expanding, no resources no fuel, the only thing we can yet expand on is people and that will be until when? Bitcoin is not for this economy we will have to build a new one.

The government does not motivate you to spend directly, it just makes sure that if you do not spend your money the general currency supply stays the same, the problem is they use that power way too quickly, and the supply is more then the need. This way when your money stays in the bank or wallet it looses value, so you better buy a villa that you do not need thinking it is some sort of investment. Mainly they motivate people with good income (not rich people but the general population) to invest in things that no one needs. If it was bitcoin you will go on a vacation in a hotel and safe some 200 000USD, that will go up in value. I am not sure the example is good but I hope you get my point, there are many things like that. no one in the government cares if you spend your money on food and you do not take out a loan to buy food, but the food economy is mainly subsidized so it is an expanse to the government not so much a growing industry.
