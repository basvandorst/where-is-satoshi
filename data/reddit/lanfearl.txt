there are not a lot more women in dogecoin. What the fuck are you talking about
@_date: 2013-10-23 15:37:36
Sounds like you are angry you didn't buy bitcoins for pennies.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:39:13
The FBI won't help you. You shouldn't have had all those coins in one wallet. 
You shouldn't have allowed that netbook to connect to the internet.
Why were you getting emails about trades? Were all your coins stored on blockchain.info? Another mistake.
@_date: 2013-07-17 15:57:11
This is an entirely silly view to take.
Widespread adoption of bitcoin is predicated on getting more and more people to want to use it.
The OP may have taken things a bit too far in this redesign, but the application itself is confusing to everyone I've showed it to who doesn't work in tech.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:22:18
Why am I being downvoted for saying that? 
@_date: 2013-03-08 22:28:29
Haha. You are so stupid its great. Start reading brother.
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:49:12
Litecoin is succeeding just fyi.

This is just baseless conjecture and hatred parading as insight. Apple charges a premium for their products and people pay it. Their products frequently win awards for best in class. They continually refine product categories. The iPod. The iPhone. The iPad. For fucks sake. Android wouldn't exist in its current form without iOS 1.0. Your blind fanaticism against apple just invalidates your argument. 
@_date: 2013-03-02 21:56:24
You are the embodiment of everything Bitcoin doesn't want.

Apples profit share isn't really decreasing. And simple oriented is absolutely a blessing in today's world. Most professionals don't have time to tinker with their phones after they turn 25. There is too much else to do.
I build my own PC's, code my own utilities in Windows, and still use iOS because I want my phone to work every single time I turn it on. I was tired of not getting updates, having to flash custom ROM's, and  not having quality 3rd party apps.

This is just a huge amount of misinformation. Titanium ring cutters are in every hospital in North America. And titanium rings can actually save fingers if then weight lands correctly 
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:12:57
Eh. Fracturing the community is not worth the price of admission. The best subreddit styles are simple. Bitcoin is perfect. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:19:03
Haha. So it's big advantage I'm not allowed to share? 
@_date: 2013-04-02 04:26:13
Can you explain this in easier terms for me? I know that may seem silly.
If I send someone a payment (which generates a new address), any backup of my wallet.dat file won't have that address.
What are the implications of this?
@_date: 2013-03-15 22:35:44
The solid black bar at the top is annoying.

This train has already left bro.

Oh come now. Motorola and Google source their parts from slave labor in china as well. Apple makes more on the iPhone than Google does on android. Stop spinning facts and drawing conclusions about America that have nothing to do with what we are talking about. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:52:49
By the metrics that more and more people are trading them everyday. The value is rising. And more exchanges are adding support. To succeed you don't have to be in first place.
@_date: 2013-03-08 07:28:19
Because you are misunderstanding how bitcoin works. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:18:30
It's absolutely not misogynistic. Not my intent or thought.
iPhones are better for people who aren't techies. Plain and simple. Typically, this is children, men who don't have the time/want to deal with technology and women who don't have the time/want to deal with technology.
Statistically, that group includes a lot of women.

He doesn't have one. He's my younger brother. Parents are pretty conservative.

How does this chrome extension work? I installed it and now it wants a two factor auth but I didn't create anything.
@_date: 2013-04-02 06:24:51
What are the implications of not having the 101st address? If you used that address to send bitcoins vs receiving them?
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:47:41
You know more than me. I am just looking at charts. It will be interesting to see where it goes.
@_date: 2013-11-10 12:50:15
Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2013-05-30 18:35:00
I've seen no evidence to suggest he is listening to his customers. They said too expensive, and he said "nope"
@_date: 2013-03-15 18:03:45

Reddit is popular because it's simple. Don't change simple.
@_date: 2013-03-26 13:47:46
lol what? There is nothing wrong with bitcoin -qt
@_date: 2013-07-17 01:55:24
Happy cake day dude! Love your attitude here. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:33:20
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:01:28
As a seventeen year old, you could have bought bitcoins if you wanted to. Where there is a will, there is a way. You were basically an adult.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:28:18
How do you pronounce mBTC?
@_date: 2013-05-30 14:54:42


Is it? The top voted thing after his pricing model is that people think it's too expensive. So how is not listening to his customer's a great attitude?
@_date: 2013-02-25 16:15:34
I'm in the USA. Very relevant. 
You would meet up with someone for one bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:39:01
wow. hmmm. haha. this description scares me.
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:40:18
I don't think you know what the term rational means.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:07:53
The iphone certainly doesn't "suck", but works much better for a significant portion of the consumer base, including incidentally wives and children.
@_date: 2013-03-08 06:18:30
Your 5970 does 325 MH/s twice? Explain this to me. Can I do this with my 6950?
@_date: 2013-03-07 20:05:36
blockchain.info isn't storing anything.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:44:16
It's a bit silly for him to be blaming Gox. Yes Gox needs to beef things up, but he clearly is just looking for someone else to blame.
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:37:16
They haven't shipped one of those devices yet. 
@_date: 2013-06-18 15:01:42
Tell me more about 3rd printing. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:29:02
What complexity to your thoughts
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:54:36
Right. He is saying "if you had a jalapeno on 2/26 you would earn x", But the issue is no one had a jalapeno at that date. No one has one yet. 
I just get uncomfortable when people post positively about BFL when they haven't shipped a single device and have taken hundreds of thousands of dollars in preorders.
@_date: 2013-10-25 14:21:19
Do you have any paper wallets?
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:47:10
Certainly only one currency exists on Earth. TIL
@_date: 2013-10-25 14:22:33
I would absolutely love this. I was just about to ask for a guide to do it. Encrypting. Paper wallets. The whole bit. I'd love to feel more secure about my bitcoins.
