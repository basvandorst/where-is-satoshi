just chiming in to say I'm so jealous
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:28:56
Right, so every million dollar transaction, not every transaction. And that’s assuming the fee% remains unchanged years into bitcoins future 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:09:05
Exactly, bring on the crash. People paying attention to it at the time will be the next round of lucky millionaires.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:00:29
Is anyone else looking forward to the crash lol? Id love to snag 1BTC, I have a ton of faith it will bounce back even higher like it always has.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:14:03
careful there
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:20:04
hey daddy
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:06:26
That depends, does the Megamillions lottery give out trillion dollar jackpots?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:13:01
It'll crash for sure, and then rise to a new ATH just weeks(days?) later.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:19
Is this a fucking dream
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:50:54
This level of theft is unfathomable and no one outside of the bitcoin sphere seems to even realize or care LOL
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:31:50
Which is so interesting to me. It's such a human psychological response to solid numbers.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:15:54
Yup I think this will be a cycle between Alts and BTC 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:50:30
yes pls &lt;3 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:12:13
by tomorrow???
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:05
LOL GET READY
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:14:38
IMMEDIATELY pay off your credit card
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:33:32
Exactly, eliminate my student loans and maybe a little extra is all I could ask for.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:52:36
This is the exact car I want, congrats!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:00:20
pull out enough to make back your 120, therefore you cannot lose. Leave the rest in. But it's up to you.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:28:42
Where the hell did they even process that?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:23:28
17k to 18k in 5 minutes
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:12:18
Not sure what other options there are, everything is struggling to keep up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:59:03
Is this supposed to be surprising? It literally almost hit 20k - a figure we didn't expect until well into next year. Many people just became mega-millionaires.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:08:22
If so, maybe someday I can finally afford 1 BTC!
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:14:34
100% this.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:41:06
I know it's so stressful lol, but very exciting.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:14:18
What? No you won’t. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:18:01
What the actual fuck
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:08:07
lol it was there for literally 30 seconds
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:12:31
17300 LOL
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:48:06
