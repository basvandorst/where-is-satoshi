the fact that you think there are blocks with IOTA is an example of your ignorance on the subject. IOTA doesn't work with a blockchain but with a Tangle with a DAG. Bud!

this is a common misconception about IOTA and farm I could give you the same link to a bitcoin article wich says bitcoin is a ponzi sceme or some other type of scam. Just because some clown on the internet said so doesn't mean it's true.

No its because btc almost hit 5k that smart money started to pull out. I luckily too before this shitstorm hit.

it's true bruv. The POW does cost you 10-30 sec of your time and man it cost like 0.00000001$ in electricity cost. I'd rather have the ability to move thousands, millions and even billions dollars worth of assets with no fee than to pay $1000 fee every time i move a mill.

It's already capable of doing up to 1000 tx per second bud. That's about a million more than bitcoin and that's without the use of flash network and low adoption. Adoption increases this tx per second as a opposed to decreases it (like with bitcoin). If you had done your research on IOTA you would know this bud. Cya in 2 years bud with your 3-4 tx per second, bud.
