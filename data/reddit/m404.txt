you may think so, but economically speaking, those who collaborated smartly with the Nazis before and during ww2, had quite a success to show off (or rather, keep quiet about :P) at the end.
this is not to condone anyone who did, for obvious reasons :D, just to point out that for those who were after the money, the Nazis weren't exactly the losing side in terms of economy.

yes, most of them maintain a large set of their money in fiat currency on the side, also i think for tax purposes.

are you talking about some hypothetical ban for bitcoin in the US or ... ?
you can actually cash out bitcoin in USD.
also, if you look at insider trading success stories etc, investors seem to _directly_ go for the methods that aren't legal (more profit) ... seems like they would've done him a favor if they had forbidden to cash out BTC into USD (who's to stop him to cash out BTC to any other fiat currency of his choice, and then purchasing USD with that ?).

I'd like to know how you envision someone having knowledge of modern day economy, but doesn't understand the first thing of computers.
the man doesn't make his own choices in an office all on his own, he has _tons_ of advisors for that (who obviously do understand tech), and he trusts his advisors.
he's a very good business man at that point, but he's not making any money anymore by being a prodigy in the world of economics.
the time when he played the system to make a lot of money was quite a different economy.

having said that, it's a prediction the average school student could've done.

yeah we "leftist run countries" have no clue what you're talking about when you say our economy isn't working.
i make less money than i would in the US, in a place where everything is more expensive, and i still can afford a much better lifestyle ... makes you wonder about priorities ;)
conservative history 101 : adapt "allegedly" better system to 10%, watch it fail, blame the system and go back to the "old ways", promising to make everything great again ... 
the us was never properly regulated, let alone over-regulated.
wtf are you comparing yourself to, China?!

well apparently, they don't. else they would've tripled their money investing in bitcoin 6 years ago, like so many nerds did, dont you think?

and why would that have been wrong?
i was an early adopter of internet, with 9600 baudrate modems, and CD-ROMS were all over the market back then, with floppies basically only existing because the writer was too expensive yet (by the time 56k modems were widespread, the floppy died because the writer became affordable, plus we had zip drives etc).
i don't know if that's what you were insinuating, but the CD-ROM was old tech by the time the internet took over ...

when did it become near impossible to cash out BTC?
i don't know your state personally ofc, but i have no issues cashing it out in EUR (which by definition means you can cash it out in USD, unless you think it has become impossible to buy USD with EUR).

yeah well, I'm not sure if half of the us nation alive at the moment really has the average education you'd be getting if you'd be in school now ... so you know ...

actually, Microsoft initiated the transfer to other mediums pretty fast, Windows was one of the first commercial products (next to the movie industry ofc) that started being released on DVDs (for obvious size reasons) and they even had plans to transition to flash (usb sticks) but internet bandwidth grew faster than expected, so they buried that more or less ...
