Please be more presize we are talking about BTC not USD.
There are limits for max channel sizes but these are not in $ but in BTC. (2^24 Satoshi) which is at the moment with the actual exchange rates aprox 2000US$. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 10:49:59
you have to change the spec
 
wher you found this: 
MUST set funding_satoshis to less than 2^24 satoshi.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:13:08
beside of china, korea or other Bitcoin bans.. the most important is, why Charlie has changed his twitter avatar?
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:12:48
is "MUST set funding_satoshis to less than 2^24 satoshi." not the max amount of a channel?
got this from.: 
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:45:34
yes, you are right, opening and closing a channel will need TX fee. (use segwit addresses for this to lower this :)) 
once you open a channel you can use it a long time for a lot of payments to various recipients. sure that the network and merchants need to first accept lightning payments and sure you have to block some BTC into your channel. But if there is a wide acceptance of cheap and fast payments this will happen (hopefully)

even in this case if you (with a wide range of you not you in special) build from source you did not notice this. Or did you check the code and understand well? Sure it's fine to do and to run the code from source and build but this is not a 100% safe way. also you need to check the makefile.
and a line which call a thread with an argument looks per se not too bad.. 
so many thanks for the electrum team to find it out! Really a good work.

I run an ipv6 electrum server on:

also tor on:
drp4pvejybx2ejdr.onion : 50001
@_date: 2014-12-17 12:54:47
If you know how to open a console and how to run a command on a linux/Unix box, running a server is quite step by step and easy forward:
you need 
- bitcoind running 40 GB HDD Space 1 GB Ram
- for the electrum database 15 GB HDD 
- for the electrum server 1 GB Ram
it work with less ram but a 2 GB Ram machine is not to expensive
sure you need a stable internet connection..
I also have several servers running also one within tor network.
as the server run anyway i have no more costs on this and i think it is helpfull for the community

my post should read as sarcastic...
as you said, one step after another. And I did not like "both" ideas. Faster Blocks may result in much more orphans and a more complicates spread of the blockchain, even more complicated if there are larger blocks.
@_date: 2015-05-22 08:21:15
so not 1 Million BTC to buy.. ;(
@_date: 2015-05-11 07:41:58
good idea!
also, if we are starting to change everything, we should also change the hashing algorithm and why not change also the address format.
Then we can also think on replace the POW to POS?

what is bad when anybody, whatever his reasons where, not want to update. Maybe he use his node for his network after a hard fork with his 1 MB Blocks. And then he do mining on this node for his own Blockchain.
you cant force somebody to update, what you can do is, on your node, block connections from other nodes you did not respect.

@_date: 2019-12-06 21:03:03
the recommendation is that you generate a new address for each transaction and therefor a lot of websites genereate a new btc address for each reload or device.. so its complicated in tip one
tip 2. here you need to interact with the vendor on a different channel than you can ask for the right address also. why you need to interact? because the hacker/virus can modify also the receiving of the small amount too.
it is a hard problem until there is no trusted third party to enable verification. https here you trust the certificates, pgp you need to trust the keyserver.. in each of such cases there is a third party or direct interaction involved in the verifying.
