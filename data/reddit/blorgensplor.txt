Are you serious? 
I'll give you my view on bitcoin.  
In 2009 when it was worth pennies I was sitting in my college dorm thinking about buying $10-20 worth until my girlfriend (now wife) told me I was an idiot. Looking back at it, we both wish we did. From that point up until about 2-3 weeks ago I never really cared much for it besides checking up on it. 
Wife wanted to make a purchase with btc so we started looking into how it really worked, got a wallet, bought some, etc. Now that I've dipped my toe in it, what's my opinion of it? It's a scam. 
Why? 
* One of the bigger reasons people went into cryptocurrency were to get away from the "corrupt banks" but it's no different. Everything you do has a fee associated with it, way more than any bank has ever done. 
* Speaking of fees, it'll never be widely accepted as a currency. Buy btc? 3% fee. Sell btc? 3% fee. Send to a wallet? 3% fee. By the time you buy it, send it to a wallet and purchase something you're already out 5%+ in fees and that's not even taking into account that it could have plummeted in the time it took for it all to process.
* Oh, processing times you say? Yea, I deposited money into a broker on the 12th and I can't even touch my btc until tomorrow. 9 business days to be able to use my "currency" and that's not even including the time it'll take to actually send it to the next person. Are there faster ways? Yea, but that'll be more fees. 
* It's no where near anonymous. Everything I've dealt with required banking information, driver's license and/or passport to "verify your ID". 
* Verification is also useless. You have to provide all this information to verify your identify but if you lose one little code you're locked out of your wallet with the excuse of "Sorry, we can't risk giving you access to the wallet. That $XXXX is lost." You want all this information to verify I am who I say I am but you can't use it to let me back into my wallet?
* Being "in control" means nothing when wallets have been hacked several times already. Sure, you could keep everything yourself but then you risk actually losing it. Also several sketching wallets out there that have just taken the money and ran with it. 
I hate to break it to you, but bitcoin it's the future. It's the internet version of Mary kay or cutco knives. That's it. It's entire existence is companies using it as a way to make money from applying fees to everything and people circlejerking about how it's the future in hopes more people buy it so their investment is worth more. 
If people want to discuss bitcoin as a "investment", that's fine but lets stop pretending it's going to an actual currency.

How can you hope for bitcoin to be widely accepted while at the same time trying to justify $30 fees?
