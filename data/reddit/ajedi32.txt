My guess is the intent was to address scenarios like this: let's say I have two computers on my LAN, one of them being a server running a TOR hidden service for sharing CP, and another being a laptop containing personally identifiable information for myself.
I think the idea is that in addition to allowing the FBI to compromise the server containing the TOR hidden service with some sort of attack, the warrant would also allow the FBI to continue the attack and compromise my laptop to find out who I am and where I live.
Assuming the law is worded as described in the article though then yeah, that's definitely too broad, as the warrant would effectively be covering all computers on the internet. At the very least there needs to be some sort of restriction requiring the FBI to have probable cause to believe that each computer they're attacking is controlled by the same person or organization that controls the computer the warrant was originally issued for.

Bitcoin's energy expenditure is not perportional to its transaction rate. The difficulty automatically adjusts to keep the time between blocks relatively constant, so a comparison like that doesn't really make sense.

The point in the OP though is that if Bitcoin ever gets to that point, you won't have to sell because Bitcoin will _be_ the world's currency. Use it to buy whatever you want; no need to sell it for fiat.

Because it's impossible for the network to know that two different wallets are controlled by the same person.

No matter, the Bitcoin blockchain is a public ledger. Anyone who has the address can already see how much was donated: 
Looks like you've gone over 1 BTC now, that's awesome!

So basically Donald Trump's campaign strategy?
