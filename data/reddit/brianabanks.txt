Thats what I was thinking because if it is a fork it is no differnce then copying everything before and then doing your new thing from that point forward. Think forking a repo on github. Which if that is the case, I suspected there was no need to keep my coins on coinbase, as I would get the new coin as well in both branches. I am assuming it would be the same private key for both of the branches which is why their could be a confusion to which one you are selling if the mix up the names of them. Does that sound accurate?

But is it true that you will only get the new coins at the fork if you hold the coins in coinbase during the fork. Coinbase made a statement saying that if you hold 1btc in coinbase at the fork, you will get 1 of the new coin as well. Is it possibl to still get 1 of the new coin even if you held it in your own wallet?

Isnt this fork a little different compared to the last one? I would expect at least to drop some. Not sure how much. One thing I am curious of is all of the new people that just bought bitcoin because it has been on such a tear. Do they even know what is about to happen?

This is more than likely what I will do.

I currently have a wallet with exodus which is pretty slick and I have practiced sending eth to and from just to practice. I have a trezor as well that is on the way.
