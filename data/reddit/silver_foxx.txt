I was just in Montreal earlier this summer!
 
They have an entire shop devoted to Bitcoin. Seems kind of like a pawn shop from what I could gather (was closed when I saw it).
 
I also noticed they had a few ASIC miners running.

Hey there, I'm a supervisor in a workshop dedicated to E-waste recycling.
 
A smashed up iPhone is just as easy to recycle as a non smashed iPhone. Actually, it's even easier, because then I don't have to smash it up myself!
 
I honestly don't know where you got the idea that it couldn't be recycled from.

Nope! Thats actually exactly how we do it with everything we get! Remember, we're just looking to separate each of the individual metals and boards. Nothing say that means they have to be in any particulard condition. For example, we get buttloads of HDDs almost daily. We could spend 15-20 minutes a pop taking each individual screw out, but it is FAR easier to just unscrew the cover, turn it over and smash out the actual disks. Two or three more screws and you have an all aluminum HDD shell, an E-motor, and some magnets (I think we get steel prices for the magnets)
 
Sometimes it's easier to just go all hulkarama on stuff, and collect the resulting pieces rather than spend the time to take it apart in a more civilized fashion.
 
Give me a flathead, a philips head (maybe one small one large) a hammer, nd some standard hex keys, and I can take apart anything from  a laptop charger to a 70" flatscreen TV. Just don't expect to get any spare parts out of it.

Toronto, Dundas square. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:10:53
Niagra Falls, or Okanagan Valley?
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:14:50
I think you were talking about this a few months ago, and I think you pointed out it was going to be a place that got 'approximately 30 million visitors a year'. I guessed Dundas Square Toronto, was I right?
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:45:55
Which actually effected the price positively.
 
After TSR shut down, BTC was ALL over the news, and that brought BTC into the lives of hundreds of thousands who otherwise probably wouldn't know about it.
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:11:37
Sorry for your loss man, gambling can really be a bitch!
 
Come tell us your story over at I'm a mod there, and we're a new but growing community, I'll gladly throw you 10 mBTC, it's not .4 BTC, but hey, maybe others will pitch in too!
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:40:20
Wouldn't that equate to (roughly) the number of vulnerabilities patched? I don't see how that is concerning. If anything, it is a reassurance that CB IS actually working on any problems they may find.

How is this a bad thing?
 
It shows just how amazing the BTC community is. This kid was handed a life changing sum of money, and im guessing the donaters themselves probably had their lives changed by BTC themselves, and they decided to pay it forward.
 
And then the kid hands the majority of it away to charity? I seriously love the BTC community. I truly believe that BTC will not only change the world, but it will also change the way we as a species see each other and interact with each other. 
 
BTC truly is a major step towards a true global community, and this guy just showed us all how incredible that really is.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:57:08
Oh yeah I plan to back them up just in case. But I can pretty much guarantee they wouldn't just forget about it.
 
Basically I've been talking to various friends and family about BTC for a few months now, and for the first time I can actually buy some for myself. And basically this is the first year I can even AFFORD to buy gifts (was broke unemployed and homeless up until earlier this year) and my family has always known and been fine with me not being able to give gifts. 
SO now that I can, I want to give them something cool and unique while simultaneously fucking with them.
 
When it's time to exchange gifts and I pull out a handful of scraps of paper, they will probably think I just couldn't afford gifts again this year. As most of my family are well aware of BTC from my "preaching" the look on their faces when I give them their own coins, and it being the first time I CAN give gifts since my early teens, will be priceless.
 
And the fact this crash is happening when I FINALLY have some spare money to spend is rather nice. 
EDIT: And I don't mean to offend anyone with that last statement by the way. I know a lot of you lost a lot of money, and truly I understand and am sorry. But for me personally this week is literally the first time I can actually get any despite having known about it for months. So knowing I can get twice as much for the amount I would have spent anyways is pretty encouraging.

[My plastic cash begs to differ.](
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:59:40
Haha, no I'm not an early adopter (though that would have been nice) but I do happen to have a little BTC lying around. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 11:05:34
Yeah I guess I was looking at it out of context.
 
I always ask "Do you think the USD was perfectly stable a few years after it's inception?" when talking to folk about BTC and it's 'legitimacy'.
 
I guess in this case, I was thinking about the absolute *first* users of it, but I can totally see what you mean.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:26:31
Ahh, this eventuality didn't even occur to me, and I can see what you mean. I agree that is and will be a pretty low thing to do, but sadly it WILL happen. I don't think it will be too big a deal though. I mean it is essentially the same as people bumming for change on the street (I've been there personally actually) and of course people with a lack of ethics will try to manipulate others. I guess it just comes down to a judgement call on the part of the donater.
 
Still, I think while some will take advantage of this, most people will stick by their morals and ethics.
 
 By the way, I'm actually a quadrapelegic blind gay syrian refugee, spare some Coin?
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:31:10
Why does not being in the US stop you from accepting it?
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:35:03
Oh, my bad. I'm still ignorant to a lot of the finer points of bitcoin, haha.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:34:26
Why not? Is there any particular reason? 
I wanted to give them a little  coin so they could mess around and experiment with it.
EDIT: Okay from what I gathered I'm guessing most of you think this will be the first they hear of BTC, but no they are all at least aware of what it is, and have a basic knowledge of how it works.
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:56:04
I didn't say I had no bank account. I said I had no access to *internet banking*. I am 23 years old, and working 60 hours a week to support myself and my dog. I have a bank account, but no access to a credit card. For various reasons, I am limited to a savings account and do not get access to online banking.
 
I have no problems with converting my BTC into various other forms of currency, I really do not get where you or the users in that other thread are getting this from.
 
I was simply asking what people would think of Chucklefish (the game company) accepting BTC as *another option* to PayPal, or Credit cards.
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:56:13
Yeah exactly. I think that's why the price has been flying so high lately. A bunch of people who don't REALLY know about the currency are buying it thinking they're going to make thousands. And just the coins being horded instead of circulated is driving the price higher and higher.
 
I really do think it'll get pretty high, but I am also pretty sure it will peak and collapse. Probably not down to $0, but I do think it will lose a significant amount of it's value once the casuals (for lack of a better term) realize it's not exactly the get rich quick scheme they thought and people start selling.
EDIT: Pure speculation, of course.
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:50:13
WELP. My planned xmas presents for family members of paper wallets with $50 of BTC on them just crashed a little. Now they're only $25 wallets. . . But I guess this means I can buy more of them at least! Silver linings people. Don't make any rash decisions just yet!
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:13:23
Yeah like I said I'm doing naught but speculating. And yeah, I'm no expert by any means, but I do feel I know enough to be pretty confident when talking about it. 
 
And that's actually why I doubt it'd ever crash to $0. As long as more and more merchants keep accepting it, it will ALWAYS have value, but is that the same value the coins would have sans the merchants? There in lies the real question.
 
But I do agree a total crash is probably really unlikely.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:07:15
Haha yeah, I actually didn't even realize the distinction between treating it as a commodity instead of a currency until pretty recently. And I think that is EXACTLY what people are doing. So many people are looking at it as them buying a product, when in reality it is the equivalent of exchanging USD for YEN. It's just holding your money in one form instead of another.
 
I think once people start realizing that, the price will either drop a fair amount, or it will just stop growing so fast.
Either way, I'm still sitting here kicking myself in the ass for not getting in back in the day.
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:06:57
Thanks for joining!
 
I really hope this sub grows and becomes something amazing.
 
With about ~40 users, we have already seen over 100 mBTC (and a few months of gold) get handed out, and more than that, people are getting a chance to learn more about BTC and see just how awesome the BTC community is in general!
 
Can't wait to see more fresh names over there!
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:59:24
 
I wish I could take credit for the idea, but I think that belongs to whoever first came up with RAoPizza back in the day. We just thought it would be a perfect way to share knowledge of BTC, while also spreading the wealth around.
 
I really do hope it gains more attention and takes off, I really think it has a lot of potential to be an awesome sub.
