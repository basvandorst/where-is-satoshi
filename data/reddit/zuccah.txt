I can vouch for VoS. I'm verified and have wired USD to them and had it accessible on the exchange within 24 hours. They are still small but growing very quickly. Withdrawing USD comes at quite a cost though.

The article says they are investigating and will potentially block a few sites (including btc-e) from operating in Russia. They believe they are performing money laundering and some other stuff, and will probably attempt to bring the hosts/creators to court. The site is not hosted in Russia.

In ~2010 I deposited $500 cash into a BofA ATM and it promptly crashed, deposit was not posted to my account, transaction vanished. I called the # on the ATM and told them what happened and was credited the $500 over the phone, said they would verify the amount in the ATM the next time it's opened up. I can tell you it happens.

How many of these devices shown support chip+pin? Which has been the required standard for the EMV, in the U.S.A., since last October (chip + signature to start, PIN coming later). Ah, from the ones shown, none.

Many merchants already require photo ID if you're paying with a credit card (in person).
