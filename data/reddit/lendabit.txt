Be so kind and explain your position with some kind of evidence, or otherwise... these are just empty words

Lendabit is not a scam and a proof can be the fact that we’ve registered a legal entity and are working now 100% legally. We have also filed documents for receiving a license that will let us work with fiat money.  
Our company is a start-up that just started working since July. But we’ve already launched a fully working lending service and are currently working on the Ethereum smart contracts and fiat money implementation to our platform.  
We will definitely publish our team and investors as soon as we complete all formal procedures. As of today, we can say for sure that our seed investors are the top managers of one of the major mining equipment developing company in the world. The team has many years of experience in banking, trading and the cryptocurrency market.  
The official release will be done after all legal affairs are sorted out.

I think it’s worth mentioning that our official partner is [Hashing24.com]( the service which has been working for a while already confirmed its reputation multiple times.  
The scam scenario you’ve mentioned is juicy for those who collected huge amount at once(for example ICO) and escaped with the investors’ money, but our situation is entirely different, we have only started working on this market, we are constantly developing our product and building legal business that will last.
