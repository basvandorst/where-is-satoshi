Copay Dev Here.


In order to derive a different extended private key using the same seed, you need to explicitly specify a different derivation path (normally using a different account number, following BIP44) in the import screen.
When restoring, you will need to remember all the account numbers you used  (along with the 12 words), so you can recover all your wallets.  BIP44 actually specifies that the account number should be contiguous, so the wallet can "scan" all the accounts automatically. That is not yet implemented on Copay, so you need to import each account (derivation path in general), one by one.


When using the same seed, if you ever want to "share" one of the wallets with someone else or with a software agent, you wont be able to use mnemonics, you will have to use the xpriv directly. Other than this minor detail, and the security considerations, I can't think of other disadvantage.

- fingerprint scanning is a simple protection if someone grab your phone unlocked. It will prevent someone to spend your Bitcoins unless they manage (for example) to access you device storage or tamper the scanner. Given that scanning the fingerprint is usually fast and easy, we highly recommend everyone to enable this.
 - the password is used to actually encrypt your private key, so it is a much stronger (and less convenient) security feature. It was mainly thought for our desktop versions, where other apps can easily access Copay's storage.

Yes! you can import your seed in many devices, and you wallet will be synced across them.  Tip: You can also do that using Advanced &gt; Export/Import &gt; QR which can be more convenient that writing the 12 words.
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:05:07
Breadwallet does not use the BIP44 derivation standard, so it will not be compatible with other wallet like Copay / myCelium / multibit / etc.
@_date: 2016-08-16 18:22:08
The fingerprint storage, registration &amp; validation is entirely handled but the underlying operating system. Copay does not have access to it.

From any of the mentioned wallet you can transfer later your bitcoins to Trezor. 
You can use Copay on your iPad. And also install that same wallet on [Copay's Chrome App](  in a desktop computer) So you can access you wallet on the iPad and on the computer.
Once you get the Trezor you can create a Trezor wallet using Copay chrome version, and access both wallets (the new one and the old one) from there and ealy transfer funds from each other. Then you will have a secure wallet for long term savings and a convenient wallet to petty money (from which you can spend from you iPad or smartphone). 
@_date: 2016-04-12 13:33:39
I recommend you do 2-2, one key from the phone, one key from the desktop computer, and you backup both keys in paper, in different secure places (like a safe in your home).
That way, if you lose you phone, you can restore the access from the new phone using the backup. Or recover the funds using the backup in other computer.
Also, you can have a 1-1 wallet in Copay in your phone, and load it with petty cash for everyday expenses.

Yes, export/import the wallet in 'read-only' mode (with not private key) works on all supported platforms, and it is pretty cool to allow an agent or a third person to monitor wallet transactions or propose transactions without signatures.

By default, Android 6.0.x backups all apps data on Google Servers. The backup is done automatically by Android (if the user have the App Data Backup feature on). Google claims the data is encrypted. 
While the app data consumes Google Drive's quota, it is not browsable in Google Drive.
With this update, we are disabling App Data backup in Copay, even if the user have the global preference setting enabled.

Copay Dev Here.
Copay can be used as a personal multisig. A person can create a multisig wallet (on the "shared" tab you mentioned) and then just own  all the keys.  We know that is a very common use case.
Given that Copay works on many platforms (iOS/Android/WP, Linux/OSX/Windows and Chrome App) it can be very convenient you have, say a 2-2 wallet, with one key on your phone and one one your desktop. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 13:29:50


It it is on the same device, it does not make a lot of sense. if someone get access to the device and install a key logger or tamper Copay code your funds will be gone.  Using multiple devices / platforms make is better security.

sure, let us know any question.
@_date: 2016-04-11 20:38:27
From the backup.
Copay forces the user to store a backup (12 words) before showing wallet addresses to receive bitcoins.
With that backup alone a wallet key can be recovered using Copay or other tools, like Copay-Recovery (
@_date: 2016-04-12 18:06:02
Thanks for explaining, but I am not sure I understand the use of the situation. 
Would it be better to just have a 1-1 wallet + a backup? Why you need other person to have a key?
@_date: 2016-04-11 20:34:41


For security reasons, it is better to have the keys on different devices / platforms, so if one device is compromised, your funds are still safe. Allowing multiple keys from the same wallet to be held in a single Copay instance is against the multisig security model.
 
@_date: 2016-04-21 17:39:27
What platform are you using?
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:44:52


The transaction just drop off the mempool. Check
or 
by default, bitcoin core will take the TX for ~3 weeks on the mempool. if you send a TX with a fee too low, this is the risk to you are taking.
@_date: 2016-04-13 11:58:42
In Copay you can export a wallet 'with no signing key'. Then, you can import that wallet, and propose transactions but not sign them. I think that is a better fit for your use case.  The Proposed transaction have a cryptographic signature of the creator, so other can verify it, but it is not a 'bitcoin' signature.
We use that approach all the time in BitPay.
@_date: 2016-04-11 20:26:35


Check services like  
It is an automated Policy-based cosigned, so you can add it to your Copay wallet and it will sign Transactions with the rules you define.

yes, it is. You can access your funds at any time using other wallet (importing your mnemonic) or using our static recovery tool [ or any BIP44 recovery tool.
It is NOT a custodial wallet.
@_date: 2015-06-04 00:27:56
You mean the sale wallet/copayer on different devices? Yes. No problem at all.
The backup is an encrypted jason.  To see the private keys, you can decrypt it, for example here:

One very common use case is a 2-2 wallet, in which one key is on your desktop and one key on your mobile device. An attacker would have to compromise both devices to steal your bitcoins. 
 is a similar use case.
@_date: 2015-06-06 18:41:14
Copay dev here.
I am sorry you are having problems. Your suggestions are interesting, adding a expire time would helpful in these cases.
Your funds are not lost, the restriction to no access locked unspent outputs are there to give time to other copayers to sign the pending transaction proposal. In your case, since the 'deciding' copayer is not longer present and not backup is available, the funds will be lock indefinitely.
There is a feature for one copayer to delete a pending transaction proposal, as long as 1) he is the creator, 2) no other copayer has made actions (reject/accept) on it. IE: You can create a proposal, and the erase it without problems. But if others have sign/reject, BWS won't let you. 
Recreating the wallet from the private keys, wont work. You need the extended *public* key of the missing copayer to be able to recreate the same addresses and access the funds.
The extended public keys of *all* the copayers on the wallet are stored on *all* copayers backup, so it is possible to access the funds if you have quorum of backups (with is your case I think).
We are working to create a  tool for doing that (sweep a wallet from a quorum of backups), even without using BWS. It will be ready really soon, so please stand by. That will be the easy way to regain access to your funds. 
In the meantime, I see 2 possible solutions: 
*1) Use a different BWS*
Install  point copay to it (in settings). The wallet will inform you that is on register at that BWS, and will show a  'recreate wallet' button. Click on it, and you are done. Do the same on the other copayer.
*2) Contact Bitpay's support*
So they can delete that transaction proposal on BWS. You will have to reveal your email for that, and give some proof you own 2 of the 3 keys.
Hope it helps,

@_date: 2015-06-04 18:22:21
It is BIP32 (HD).  But on top of that, wallets decide how to structure the BIP32 paths for address derivation. Some non-multisig wallet use BIP44, Copay use BIP45.
We could add a BIP44 import feature eventually.
@_date: 2015-06-04 01:41:54


Private keys are held on your device. Your device sign the transactions and sent results.  It is more secure than online wallets since an attack on the server wont compromise your funds.
 




It is better to download it. You can encrypt it with a good password (since you wont have to enter it very often) and keep it on an external hard drive / or if you have multisig, one in google drive, and in dropbox, etc.
We are working to provide better ways to backup: printable QR codes / list of words / etc.


Not sure. You can always, also, encrypt your private key (in settings), so the local copy of the wallet will have it encrypted.


Not at all.
@_date: 2015-06-04 00:25:41
Agree that backups need to be enhanced. 
With multisig HD, you need to backup not only the extended private key, but also the extended public keys of the other copayers, in order to access the funds with the proper quorum (so the 12 words wont work) See further discussion here: 
@_date: 2015-06-04 00:23:00
it is on the backlog. You can add encryption to the private key in the meantime.
@_date: 2015-06-04 00:15:59
If you receive coins on old addresses, yes, it will be show on the balance and tx history.  We decided not to show all the addresses on the UX to simplify it.
Related: Copay has a 'scan address' feature (that can be triggered manually or when a wallet is imported) that will scan all generated addresses for transactions until a gap of 20 addresses without activity is found.

@_date: 2015-06-04 05:41:21
No. Copay uses  BIP45 ( structure for deriving addresses, which is for HD / Multisig wallets. AFAIK,  no other wallet use it.
@_date: 2015-06-03 22:01:26
3 things:
 * Coordination between copayers: hold transactions proposals until they are fully signed, helps the synchronisation when locking unspent outputs, when creating addresses, etc.
 * Interact with the blockchain (using Insight servers).
 * Optionally: Notify copayers about new transactions.
Just to be clear, private keys never are transmitted, not even encrypted. Signing is done client side.
The service is called: "Bitcore Wallet Service" (BWS):  It is of course open-source, and can be run be users/companies for enhanced privacy. The API is described at the github repo.
It is possible to create other clients to interact with Copay, using BWS, like this CLI client:  which works transparently with copay wallets.
Finally, if you have created a wallet pointing to certain BWS and you decide to change, it is very easy to recreate the wallet in a new BWS (Copay will show a 'recreate' button) in this case. The BWS URL is a setting in Copay.
@_date: 2015-06-06 19:00:58

In that case, if you recover your wallet from an old backup, the autoscan may not find your funds (given that you change bitcore-wallet-service). If you use the same bitcore-walet-service as before, no problem. If you change, and autoscan do not find your coins, you will have to hit 'generate address' as many times as before.

Just like bitcoin.
Seriously? Having to defend open source software in 2015 is a little disappointing.
@_date: 2015-06-03 22:07:17
Copay always use P2SH address, even for 1-1 wallets. That is the reason addresses start with '3' (in 'livenet', '2' in testnet).
When you run Copay for the first time, a 1-1 wallet is created. There is only 1 key and it is only stored on the device (so you should back up your wallet).
The process for spending in that 1-1 wallet is as expected: You go to the 'send' tab create the transaction and tap on 'send'. The transaction will be created, signed and broadcasted.
@_date: 2015-06-04 00:20:36

Unless the user opt-in for email notifications, there is no linkage  between the wallet and the identity.  Wallets can be anonymously created, no personal data is required.
We have put a lot of effort on making the [bitcore-wallet-service (BWS)]( open source and as easy as possible to run. For users that are concerned that there wallets addresses can be link together running their own BWS should be the way to go.
@_date: 2015-06-04 00:22:19
No, all keys are held by the Copayers. The wallet configuration (m-n) is defined when the wallet is created. Multiple wallets can be accessed at the same time.

Hey, Matias from Bitpay here.
 If you prefer not to create a profile in the insight server, you can select 'Localstorage' on settings, an create a  profile in our computer (our info will not leave your device).
You can import your previous wallets, once you created a profile.

Maybe I did not make myself clear ion the previous message. *The update does not erase the localstorage*. If you had a wallet, the information is still there.

matias from Bitpay here. 
The answer is yes, your private keys never leave your system.
But, because of browser limitations Copay cannot interact with the Bitcoin network directly, and cannot discover peers automatically for p2p communications, so Copay use 2 servers: Insight (as a Bitcoin network interface) and peerJS (for peer discovery).
Both Insight and peerJS are open source and there are many public instances on the internet you can use, or you can install your own. You can change what server to use in "settings" at Copay.

In a 1-1 wallet, you could, theoretically, but I am not aware others wallet support this format.
With the Master Private Key you can create a new wallet in Copay (at create screen -&gt; advance options -&gt; enter your extended priv. key), and then go to more -&gt; Advance options -&gt; SCAN. 
What will derive address from your keys (while it find transactions on then) and recover all your bitcoins with only your Master Priv. Key. It will continue deriving addresses until a window of 20 unused address if found. This same procedure takes places when you import a Wallet in Copay.

Thanks a lot for this report.
You are right, this is a serious (an embarrassing) bug. I was able to reproduce it. It only happens when you select to store your profile on localStorage. The problem was a regression introduced a couple of days ago. "Store on this device" option on profile creation is rather new. 
The error that the username / password entered were not been used as seeds for KDF for the encryption on localstorage, and the valued were undefined. So, in localStorage, the encrypted profile was not using the selected password.  The fix was submitted here  which is backwards compatible. v0.9.1 was released because of this one.
 
This error was not present when creating a profile "on the cloud". Again, thanks a lot for this report. All platforms has been updated.

I am sorry you are irritated for no receiving a bounty for your

We do take security very seriously. In a matter of minutes after you reported the issue on reddit we investigated the cause, fixed it and released a new Beta version in all platforms.
Please note that Copay is open sourced, MIT licenced and *still Beta*  software.  With Copay, Insight and Bitcore we are trying to build free  and open platforms that can be used by companies and individuals to develop new products and servicies and thus 
enhance the Bitcoin ecosystem.
We could offer bounties in the future, but for now, we just  think there are better ways to accomplish that I previously stated.

* You can set your out extended master key when you create or join a wallet, (Inside 'advance options').  You can also see the extended master key of a wallet on More -&gt; advance options.
* There is a command line script (on util/) to sweep multi sig wallets from their master private key (currently it needs all master priv keys, but it should only need, in a m-n wallet, m extended private keys and m-n extended public keys).
No sure about TOR browser, it is not on the current roadmap, not sure how difficult would be to make that happen.

Sorry about that. You can select 'localstorage' on settings, and your profile will be stored on your device (not Insight). Copay is still beta, and we are trying to understand which are the most adequate features. Storing only on localstorage, created a lot of problems for the user, for example, localstorage could get erased when upgrading browser versions, without warning.

is not a web wallet. Everything is implemented client-side, there is not communication to the server in the normal "web application" sense.  As copay.io states, soon there will be desktop and mobile versions based on the same source code.
Copay, uses 2 servers: 1) is Insight, to check addresses balances and interact with the bitcoin network and 2) peerJs to find other peers, and the beginning of the p2p session.
Both Insight and peerJS are open source. Bitpay provides public instances for both of them, but there are options (there are many insight instances and peerJS instances free to use on the web).
EDIT: Please check  README for more details on this.

There original idea of the "stealth part" was to share a different extended address (an BIP branch) for each payer. So the payer would be able to pay many times, using different *and multiple* addresses each time, without the need to communicate anything to the payer (nonce or index) . The use case of posting a fixed address (say in a webpage) to receive payments from different payers was not contemplated. I agree with the comments that it does not fit for that use case.

Yes. You can also backups wallets individually, and the backup format is compatible with 0.6.4.
The import Profile backup is not installed yes, will be delivered soon, but the import / backup wallets is already there.
Sorry about the problems you had with the TX proposal sync process. In 0.7.1 we have enhanced and optimised  a lot the sync, once you reach a stable state, it should be much faster and reliable. A tip there: Within a wallet, in settings, in adv. options, you can purge both pending and all tx proposals, in case something went bad and you are seeing old tx proposals. That will unlock the funds.

Copay developer here.
The 'forced' backup step is just a security mesure to be sure that the user has a backup before putting coins into the wallet. 
Copay is only client side, and it uses the browser's localstorage to store wallet's data. Localstorage can get deleted my mistake, so we decided to force the backup.
We should explain this on the app.

Copay dev here.
This is a well known issue in the underlying bitcoin lib that Copay use (bitcore-lib, also maintained by Bitpay), that there are many PRs to fix it, like this one:
The issue it self:
Around 2% of the wallets generated by bitcore (used by Copay, etc) will lead to a different extended private key. While this 2% of wallet will not comply with the BIP32 standard (the error itself is that they do not 0-pad the key before hashing, see this line:  the wallets are ** perfectly usable and recoverable ** and the seed can be recoverable in Copay/Bitpay app, using our Recovery Tool ( or custom script. 
We will merge this PR in next releases, and from there we will be 100% compatible with BIP32. In the meantime, there is no need to panic, is just a mis interpretation of some edge cases of the BIP32 standard, which lead to a different, but still coherent, key derivation.

Insight server is used to relay encrypted and signed messages between Copayers. So, yes you need that.
You can run your own Insight server if you want:  and use it for communications. 
And also you can sweep the wallet (with a command line script for now  with the Copayers' private keys without using Insight.
@_date: 2015-01-07 21:58:18


You are right, is a copy of your seed encrypted with your password.
Mnemonic is not enough in this case. In order to recover your funds you need 1) quorum of private keys 2)  the extended public keys of ALL copayers (no only quorum). Therefore, we decided to create a file backups. 


It used to, but it was very confusing to users . Imagine you are creating a 3-5 wallet. Say you create 1 key only as a backup, so you enter the creation process once, and never enter again (you have the private key, but not all the public keys). That action will used to block the wallet, since all others copayers would wait for that one to backup the wallet.


That is exactly the way in work, in case you use cloud storage.

Hey, Matías from BitPay here. 
Great to know you are planning to use Insight. Let us know any doubt. There are no plans to implement BIP32 on the server, we though about it for sometime, but we decided to do it  client side for privacy concerns.
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:22:25


There is no "buggy private key". I see what you mean but to be perfectly clear, private keys are fine. 2% of then were derived using a different (wrong) interpretation of the BIP32 standard. But they are 100% usable and recoverable.


If people recover the seed using a different wallet that does not use bitcore-lib, they will see 0 balance, but they can still recover it using other tools. Many wallets use an ad-hoc derivation schema, I dont think this is a mayor issue, specially considering bitcore-lib, bitcore-wallet, Copay, Bitpay-app, etc are 100% open source, so we will be available indefinitely.


Once the issue is corrected, future version of this software will be aware of this issue, so recovery will be possible.


Users do not need to do anything about this issue.

Copa Dev Here.
Thanks a lot for your comments. An important correction: Copay does NOT hold the encrypted wallet private keys at the server.
*The private keys are on the client side and NEVER leave the device*. That is why we force backups before showing wallet addresses.
Regarding the original question: It is possible to recover a Copay wallet using other open source tools or any BIP44 compatible wallet, so you are not bond to Copay. It would be also possible to just download Copay from source and run it; or run your own server (BWS) that is also open source, so you are not tied to BitPay's servers.

Just a comment regarding `The bad`:  for creating a wallets, there is no personal info required. So, while what you are saying is exactly correct, there is no recorded link between wallets and identities, and a single person can create multiple wallets, with no linkage between those wallets. 
Having the xpub in the server helps  coordinating copayers, simplifies the synchronization and support.  In previous versions of Copay ( &lt;0.9) we have no access to that info, and it was really a nightmare to support it and debug it, so we decided this solution plus make a very simple BWS server that can be installed in seconds, for users that need higher privacy.

At the moment we support fingerprint authentication on iOS and Android devices as a software security measure for that use case.
For enhanced security we also support setting a passphrase to encrypt the private keys (so the passphrase need to be entered every time the private key is used).  
The PIN code would be similar to the fingerprint (ie. it does not encrypt the storage, it would be just a software protection). Given that many of new devices are adding fingerprint sensors, we have been postponing its implementation, so I am not sure when or if it will be eventually be delivered.

Copay dev here, thanks for the comments.
The possibility of having 2 (or more) keys in different devices compromised in a wallet is way smaller that having 1 key compromised. To an attacker,  gaining access to 2 (or more) keys in totally different devices is extremely difficult. I use this setup: 1 key at the desktop + 1 key at the phone. I also have a non multisig wallet on my Copay's wallet phone for petty cash, usually with a balance of ~ 0.5BTC, which I refill from the multisig wallet.
BTW, we just released v1.1.2 ( which have some minor new features plus fixes. In particular, there is a feature to create backups without the private key of the wallet, so you can import that in a device 'without signing capabilities'. You can check the balance, create new addresses, create transaction proposals, but you can sign them. I found that pretty cool  for certain use cases :)

The device ID is used to encrypt the local storage of Copay on the device. It is only used there: ( This provide protection if the storage is removed and access from other device. 
It can be audited on the code that the device Id is not used in any other place. Some people has expressed their concern about Copay asking this permission on Android, maybe we should remove it on the future.

Copay dev here, some comments regarding your questions:
1- Extended private keys for transaction signing *stay on each device*, they are never send to other copayer or to the server.
2- What is shared is the public key, so all copayer can create addresses based on that.
3- The QR for wallet creation has: 
   - An ID, so all copayers can find each other using that ID in the wallet creation process
   - A wallet private key (not the private for bitcoin tx  signing, but other random private key) so copayers can sign their public key when joining the wallet, and other copayers and BWS can verify that the joining copayer has the correct invitation.
   - A network flag (testnet or livenet)
There is not 'primary' device.

JFYI, you can set up email notifications in `settings` per wallet. Push notifications is an open ticket yet.
@_date: 2015-07-22 13:11:44
you got it right again :)
The "other" private key shared in the wallet's invitation code is used so copayers can sign *their* extended public key, and afterwards the rest of the copayers can verify that signature. This is to prevent BWS or other person with no invitation for joining a wallet in creation.
@_date: 2015-07-22 13:07:42
Hey, 
There is no PIN to lock the app, we trust the device's security (ie: locking system of your phone/desktop) for that.  I dont think that is on our roadmap, we had it on Copay ~0.5 to ~0.8 ( but then we decided to remove it.
What it is possible, is to encrypt the extended master private key of each wallet (in `settings`). This will prevent someone without the passphrase to sign transactions. Also, this is good for environment where the app data is easily accesible by other apps (like a desktop). Encrypting the priv key could prevent other app to stole your bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 12:52:37
You can setup encryption for private key in `settings`. In that case you will need to enter the passphrase every time you sign a transaction.

Go to settings -&gt; Addresses , and check at the end of that page how many inputs your wallet have, and the aprox fee amount to move those inputs.
As other comment mentioned, it is possible your balance is composed of very small inputs, and moving them is relatively expensive.

The multisig schema used in Copay is quite simple and standard. You can recover the funds using many open source tool, for example our own: [ which just need a block explorer to scan and recover the funds.
What ever hapends to Copay or Bitpay, using that tool will allow you to recover the funds. If the block explorer goes down,  a very simply modification of the tool (by using [BC.info]( por example) will help user access the funds.

The partially signed transaction is transmitted to all copayers, and they can sign the transaction locally and send the signature only to the bitcore-wallet-service. Once a quorum is reached, the transaction is ready and can be broadcasted.

You would lose.  
What has BCH has to do with this discussion??      Stay on subject. 
7% failed payments is exorbitant. Would you prefer Bitpay to charge 5% fees, to cover all the failed payment processing? That will be more than credit card companies...  
 Do you understand that these means that merchant using custom BTC payment solutions will have to deal with 7% of payments been underpayments, overpayments, or settled after 15min the BTC/USD rate was issued?  Many people will try to pay from their exchange account directly... do you see the problem?

It  means you don't need to backup your wallet more that once, since it is a HD wallet, and all wallet's addresses can be derived from the backup.
Maybe it should say: Only one backup per copayer is needed.




Correct. 
To recover from from a m-of-n wallet you need:
 - m backups (that hold in total: m extended private keys + n extended PUBLIC keys, so address can be regenerated)
 OR n extended private keys.


Providing encrypted cloud storage simplify mobility for users and also helps managing backups. But it also creates a risk: wallets can been attacked remotely only defended by user's password.
Because Copay v0.10 and Bitcore-wallet-service simplify the backup handling and allow to install the same backup on multiple devices (wallets can be safely accessed concurrently), moving wallets from one device to other is easier than it was before, so we decided to suspend cloud storage.

This was discussed in detail here:
In short, there are some Cordova Pluggins we bundle in Copay that require the permission (in particular, Identity is required by the email composer (Identity needed for autocompleting the email addresses of your contacts while composing an email, etc).
One option would be to remove those pluggins, but it will hurt usability for certain users. The best solution I can think of is to wait the upcoming Android Permissions modifications, in which certain permissions can be denied, and the app will have to adapt. Any suggestion is welcomed...
The Device ID is used to encrypt the files at the device, as discussed here: 
@_date: 2015-04-19 04:18:02
Agree. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 12:43:01
Do you mean other wallet software (not copay)? While that could be possible, I don't think any other wallet currently use the same key derivation paths that Copay does (Copay uses BIP45:  since copay is HD + Multisig. This schema is also used for 1-1 wallets, so funds wont be discovered if the xpriv key is imported on other, non-bip45, wallet.
There is an ongoing effort to provide BIP44 compatibility (ie mycelium / electrum) to Copay: xpriv keys from wallets that use BIP44 could be imported in Copay, and funds restored. Similarly, BIP44 wallets could implement a BIP45 importing feature, to discover funds from Copay. 
 
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:06:23
Sorry this is a little complex. The backup format (prior v1.2) is an encrypted JSON. Inside that encrypted JSON the extended private key can or cannot be encrypted (depends on the wallet settings). In case it is encrypted, both the backup password AND the private key password are needed to move funds.
Hopefully,with the version released today, the backups will be much simpler (using BIP39 mnemonic).
@_date: 2015-09-23 15:56:04
According to Copay, or  the private key of that backup is itself encrypted ({"iv":"S+eZKtehCArxL6XyOBbU0A==","v":1,"iter":10000,"ks":128,"ts":64,"mode":"ccm","adata":"","cipher":"aes","salt":"/az3nx68p54=","ct":"IR0WsKI5zoYb8go2YmoBiPXap2wdJzuFqJh+6yERVjNXoeG+llA0zcEF1Kg+VPOHFCTu7b9Yh625pvR3cghWwaNRjxmbpSyKKHBDP3NvaTpPTydbhZ0MqMjjl9Sk0TqVE7d2xArkI6jUY/mDlp8gml/Vxf0rmj8="}). 
It is not possible to restore the funds from that backup unless you have the password to decrypt the private key also.
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:16:02
The confirmations are shown in TX History when they are &lt;=6, and then, when a TX has more that 6 confirmations it is shown as "6+". 
Do you think it is useful to know the exact number if it is bigger that 6?  The change was made because we will be implementing a local cache for TX history ( so we want each item at the tx history to become inmutable (after 6 confirmations). 
@_date: 2015-09-27 20:32:39
In the last version of Copay [launched last week]( we implemented BIP39 mnemonic. 
Just a comment:  mnemonics are no a "machine" chosen password, but the seed of entropy of the wallet private key. Thanks to that (and other modification we made in Copay for non multisig wallets, etc) it is now possible to export-import wallets (BIP39 mnemonic) from Copay and other BIP39-BIP44 wallets, like mycelium or Electrum. We  think that is great to the user!
Regarding reentering the password, it is a good idea, maybe we can do something like Ledger, that ask for a couple of words from the mnemonic.
@_date: 2015-04-19 12:36:33
Indeed! 
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:39:01
That's a very interesting comment! :)
I always thought in a 2-3 wallet in which sig3 would have a key, and will 'clear' all the transactions under certain rules (say under 100$, per day). So you initiate the TX from your phone or computer, and in case it is not automatically clear, you can confirm it manually.
I guess they could add 'signing policies' and 'rejecting policies'... :)

We use a standard library for Copay exports (SJCL,   I dont think there can a bug there or in Copay related to that.  
If you entered the password in a mobile device, check the case of the first letter, and the spaces, JIC. Unluckily there is no other thing I can do to help.
Note that in the recent version of Copay (1.2.5, launched last week) we have implemented the standard BIP39 mnemonics for backups, to it should be much easier to store them offline securely.

Copay Dev here.
Copay uses BIP44  and for 1-1 wallets, uses P2PKH addresses, so You *can import* a wallet from Mycelium into Copay as you mentioned. But you cannot use both apps at the same time (or any other BIP44 wallet app) since new addresses will be generated in one app (like change addresses), and the other app will not see them. There is not syncronization or notification mechanism. 
There is a workaround in Copay, you can go to settings -&gt; advanced -&gt; scan addresses from funds and trigger a address scan. New address will be generated (incrementally) looking for funds.

- Wallet seeds can be easily stored or memorized. BIP39 with passphrases seem ideal for long time storage in physical locations.
-Wallet funds can be recovered from the seeds even if Copay is not accessible in the future.

Ledger is also supported.
You can create a multisig wallet between Ledger and TREZOR ;-)

You can create watch only copies of you wallet using Copay (Advanced &gt; Export Wallet &gt; Do not include private key). By doing this you can check the balance of the wallet, create addresses, and even create spend proposals, but you can't sign them.

Copay uses p2pkh for 1-1 wallets, and p2sh for multisig wallets.
And uses standard BIP44 (with account 0) for address derivation, please see:

Copay will work on both.

Copay dev here. 
Comparing Copay with BC.I, Copay holds your private key on your device, no on the cloud. The private keys never leave your device. Therefore, the only way to compromise your wallet is to access your device. Copay provides ways to encrypt your key (and only decrypt it temporary to sign transactions) or (less secure but more practical) to restrict it usage with software limitations (like fingerprint scanning).
If you are thinking of holding a considerable amount, Copay allows you to create a multisig wallet, in which each transactions need to be signed by a defined number of devices. 
I recommend doing a 2 of 2 wallet in this case, between your phone and your desktop computer.  By doing this, an attacker need to compromise your phone and your computer at the same time to access your funds, which is very difficult.
Finally, since you keys are not stored on the cloud, *you* need to backup them. Copay force a backup when you create a wallet. The backup consist on 12 words that you should write on a piece of paper and keep it safe.
Having those 12 words allows you to access the funds using multiple tools (not only with Copay, eg:

"Debitpay" or "[ " are not related to BitPay.

Copay dev here, I just answered the first ticket. Sorry, are are having a ton of tickets lately and we are running to answer them all. In general, if you have you seed, the funds should be accesibles let us work on that in the ticket thread.

Copay Dev Here.


it should take just a couple of hours max. Copay, BWC and BWS are open source and well documented. BWS uses insight-api for blockchain querying and that is were the change should be made.
Once you have that working, from Copay you can point to that BWS instance.


yes, you can. BWS, BWC, and Copay,  been free, open source and MIT-licensed projects from this shitcompany, have already dozens of forks.

The main difference is that GreenAddress handles some of your keys while in Copay all keys on a multisig wallets must be handled by the wallet owner(s). Users should evaluate which strategy fits better their needs.

People like yourself make Bitcoin adoption impossible.

Copay dev here.  thanks for you comments.
 Yes, iOS 10 is not yet supported. We will support before it gets out of Beta, you can follow the process at
