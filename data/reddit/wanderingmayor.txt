MtGox folding also creates a bargain for thousands of new investors as the price falls on other exchanges. It may create enemies but will also create new members. I tried getting in at BTC&lt;$100 but just then DWolla stopped transfers to Gox and it became hard to buy in the US. Now a place like Coinbase makes it easy and the price is cheap (cheaper than the $800 that it was stable at before the crash.) The system is strong and doesn't care if one exchange fails. I thought I saw a recent study that showed nearly half of new exchanges fail. The lesson learned in my mind is don't keep coins in exchanges' wallets, I'm going with paper.

Get your head out of dollars. China has 10x the trading volume than USD. People work on the deca system, but I think the psychological barrier as of late has been 4000 yuan which is about $650. Notice how the resistance level has been steady at $650 since the 3/3 rise? That's not Americans propping it up with a psychological barrier. $700 is about 4,300 yuan, which appears to be another psychological barrier right now. Just my take.

This shows poor understanding of the economics involved. When the whole 21M coins are mined there still won't be 13M people that own a coin. Mid and late adopters will be limited to using mBTC and satoshi's when all is said and done. The more successful it is the fewer people will own a full coin.

That graph proves nothing about adoption, it is simply a correlative graph. I could show you the same thing between population of African Swallows and price of peanut butter. I could send myself 50k transactions a day and it shows nothing about adoption.

If you bought at 630 that's the price that was locked in when you purchased. The only way to cut your losses would have been to immediately sell after buying, but like you say, their transactions don't allow for instant buy/sells of a bunch of money.

There's a gap here. Simply trading BTC doesn't make you a money transmitter, or else there would be about 100k US citizens in trouble right now. No one is going to get arrested for trading BTC. People might get tax penalties for failure to report income, but trading in and of itself isn't illegal. If you're looking to be the Western Union of BTC, then you may become a money transmitter (but the protocol removes the need for third parties like this).

31 trillion divided by the lifetime 21 million BTC that will be created yields a 2044 price of only about $1,400 per BTC. Doesn't that seem like a conservative estimate seeing how we already hit 1,200? Isn't that pretty much the price we are seeing now (about $600, as it will rise with 30 years of inflation)? Then it seems like the only people making money are the fee collectors. Edit: Nevermind, I see the estimate is based on their 200k BTC x a 2044 price of &gt;$1 million, which seems nuts. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:59:51
One theory though is that people stole the exchange's coins with the malleability exploit and Gox is trying to put it back together without validating concerns of insolvency. So, it's not necessarily just a grab and run. They might be doing that with what coins weren't stolen, but that's another aspect. Your string of comments tells me you need to do some more homework on all of it.

Trust me, I understand your point that they all function the same way, but you are hung up on inherent value and refuse to accept its functional value of what it can do for you in real life. You're too focused on internal function and not external function. One could take your argument about no inherent value and say the same thing about the 13 trillion dollars in existence that are just a digital piece of code. There's nothing real about them either, they hold no inherent value as they are just bits like crypto. Honestly, if you talk inherent value, there's nothing inherently valuable about fiat aside from its ability to burn and produce heat. When the USSR was collapsing there was no inherent value or external value in their ruble so people burned them for warmth.

You "sardonically" put words in his mouth with air-quotes, and called him unreasonable and unwilling to listen to facts when you lack critical analysis of the 'facts' of a blog. You say that he has a knee-jerk reaction, which is completely ironic in light of your over-reaction to whom you make numerous assumptions about. He never implied the USD is "invincible and immortal", and you say he is an American exceptionalist when there is nothing in his words to even imply he's American.

I'm not an economist but I can't imagine the percent of coins in use climbing over the current state of 1-2% until we finally reach a period of mildly stable prices. Users want to know they can go get some more for about the same price if they are going to spend them. If they kept stable for a year I would begin to feel comfortable using them in everyday practice, but when there's 10% jumps in value daily it makes a person just want to hold. I agree using is key to the future but stability needs to come first.

I feel that the satoshi is the real unit of currency, so with 100,000,000 per coin there will still be enough to go around. It seems a full coin however will be hard to come by in the future. That's the whole point of the deflationary system as I understand it. Even if a satoshi was worth a penny, a coin would be $1 million.

Owning isn't the issue. They can't tax for that. It's sales you make with them, say, when you cash out when we hit the moon. Sure something like localbitcoins could provide a taxless transaction, but if you ever put that money in a bank it becomes suspicious. Was it a gift? Income? or Capital gains. I was thinking years from now I would report profit as money from consulting, but that's income and therefore a higher tax rate than capital gains. Think breaking bad, with a room full of money and no legitimate way to spend it. Want to buy a car or house with the profit? Too bad.

Not that anyone here needs help tearing this apart:


There will always be miners available to take the place of a pool that a government 'takes out'. "Assassinating" a 51% pool won't cut the supply off or cease transactions.


Strawman, BTC was never meant to be anonymous. As well, his Orwellian prediction ignores how transactions work. 


He fails to indicate here what he means, the sentence comes off as pedantic and lacking context. 


Oversimplifies the hardfork concept. 


Nice tulip pot shot, but the gold analogy doesn't hold water because gold had absolutely **NO** use-value before modern electronics, yet still held value for thousands of years. 


Of course this is on CATO, the great republican think tank. 


We can trust PayPal to monopolize and take exorbitant amounts of fees equivalent to highway robbery, for a service that the world can now complete for free. 


He missed the memo about being a trustless economy? 
He also is negligent with his research pointing to GHash as a culprit after they fell from 50% to now 19% of mining network power. I guess that silly little fact would undermine his whole paper, so best to leave that part out.

Anyone who wants security in an investment needs a broker and typical investment strategy. There's a reason this shit is called speculative, and anyone keeping money or BTC on a website either knows the risk or shouldn't be in it to begin with. Those that do the homework remain ok.

Ever been unemployed or broke before? Doesn't seem like it. It had nothing to do with not keeping track of money, and he willingly paid the due plus fees but was fucked by the system for a nominal amount. Under your advice he should have just never gone into debt and starved or not paid other bills (also placing him in debt) because of job loss likely due to poor corporate accounting somewhere else with a company that was in debt. Debt isn't necessarily bad, it's how you treat it, and he responded responsibly, unlike the banks in 2008.

The lesson learned is don't keep your BTC on ANY trading site that can limit you. Get your own wallet and private key so YOU are the only person who can control where they go and when. Move back to an exchange only when you actually want to sell.

This is such bullshit. The World Bank is one of THE biggest leaders and reasons that we have halved the number of people living in extreme poverty over the last 20 years. They do more to improve world health than the World Health Organization. The loans that the IDA gives are interest free or at or below the rate of inflation so they are better described as grants. IDA is what has helped numerous nations come out of the stone age. 
What you are describing was what it looked like when countries mismanaged their loans and dragged themselves into overwhelming debt through the 70s and 80s, but check the books and you will realize 36 heavily indebted poor countries (31 were African) have had $96 billion in relief since 1996. Since then those countries have been able to achieve almost all of the MDGs. 
Their aim is to move nations from IDA to IBRD to contributing nations. If it wasn't for IBRD Germany would still be fucked, but now it's a world economic leader. Things have changed since the 80s.

This is a solution to no problem. You can text, email, or send by countless means a public address to facilitate a transaction. The big remittance problem is how do recipients actually use the coin or change the coin into usable currency? What needs to happen is the creation of an exchange in country X with field offices where people can physically go and exchange, because a big problem is these people are unbanked and thus can't just transfer funds out of an exchange over the internet. Essentially, create a western union running on BTC and low fees.

^^ Don't do this. Coinbase is great. Control your own private key unless you plan on trading frequently. And don't invest more than you're willing to lose. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 06:30:16
I know coinbase isn't an exchange, but how would this be an improvement? A lack of the 1% fee and maybe a slightly lower buy price? says they have an AML program so that's all the certification needed at the moment, unless I'm missing something. Some criticize if they will be able to handle themselves and the traffic, but why not just keep coins in a private wallet if you're worried about them Goxing you?

In response to your original post:




That's Hume's induction fallacy in action. Extreme skepticism. He was a great troll before the internet. He thought if he burned himself on lava once that it wasn't certain it would burn him again. He believed that just because the sun rose every day for the last several million years that tomorrow was no certainty. Romantic, but trollish.

However, the coins that coinbase receives through merchant selling never reach the market because coinbase has such a demand for buying. Saying merchant selling drives the price down discredits whatever is happening on the consumer's buy side, which if consumers buy back the same $ amount while the price is crashing it creates a net buying pressure. Inflation (I've heard it's around 9%) is the real driver of falling prices.

I'm not talking about encryption, but strategy. Notice how I said 'use' instead of 'send'. It seems that any email sent can be intercepted. A work around method for this is having a dedicated email account where your target of your communication also has access to. Then, write your emails and save as a draft. Since it is never sent it cannot be intercepted but it can be read by your target. NSA can't get to this type of communication, yet.

IMO you can't just call higher volume good, it could easily be fabricated and only creates volatility. Wouldn't steady and moderate volume be preferred over a single day's worth of high or low?

Not sure what exchanges you're using to get nailed at 5% off market value, but this moment the buy price on Coinbase is &lt;1% higher than the price on bitstamp, and the sell price is actually higher than market value at $497 (over 496 on bitstamp). Your buy/sell numbers are way off. This ignores thier 1% fee on both ends, but that's the acceptable market rate for the security/convenience of their system (which I for one am glad to pay)
