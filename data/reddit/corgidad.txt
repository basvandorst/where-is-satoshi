Check out the Omni protocol, built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. @_date: 2015-12-12 05:57:46
Not yet.  New info revealed much of the evidence previously released could have been faked.  More updates to come, I imagine.
@_date: 2014-01-30 01:28:22
If this is the case, I'm sure that an acceptable arrangement can be arrived at. But yes, in the case of mistaken extra BTC by far the easiest solution would have been to just leave it on the account. 
I have not yet seen the case in question so I can't say for sure though.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:33:41
You don't have to prove yourself to anyone on the internet.
Just wanted to say thanks for continuing to post during this moment of crisis here, I'm sure many of us appreciate your commentary/insight.  
@_date: 2014-02-09 10:18:37
Oh, sorry, thought you were referring to BrazenAmberite.  
That being said, Capt_Roger_Murdock did follow that up with "but not a guarantee".

Looooong before.  I heard it as early as November on tradingview chats.

Mistakes/errors happen.  When they do, we fix them.  
@_date: 2014-01-30 03:38:27
I haven't seen your case so I can't comment on it, but from your comments in the thread, you appear to have received product you have not paid for.  
You must either return said product, or pay for it.  That's just how things work.  
@_date: 2014-02-12 13:30:25
Let's hope so!!
@_date: 2014-01-30 06:02:26
Edit:  Found his case.  It had already reached a resolution to which OP had agreed to last week.  There does not appear to be any further issue, but I am happy to help if otherwise.  
@_date: 2014-03-21 19:19:40
WP = Well-Played.  A compliment!
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:20:49
Absolutely.  Selling out the long-term faith in the bedrock consistency of the protocol is completely worth it.  
Now if we could just convince EVERYONE else in the community to follow us to the new chain instead of just staying with the old and stupid current chain...
@_date: 2014-01-30 01:21:01
Super-edit:  I found your case.  Your issue had been previously addressed and the financial resolution ended significantly in your favor.  I apologize for the trouble though, and although this individual case has already been resolved by our support team, we're taking steps to ensure these issues are eliminated and that all orders to buy and sell bitcoin go through smoothly. If you suspect that your account balance looks incorrect, please let us know as soon as possible and we'll be glad to assist.
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:55:26
You are correct!
@_date: 2014-12-31 12:56:32
Hope I'm not too late!
@_date: 2014-01-30 06:13:13
OP has so far declined to PM me his case number to look directly, but yes, it would appear that he did withdraw/sell them, otherwise the server would never have charged his credit card.  
The server pulls funds to recover negative balances in this priority order:  BTC on balance --&gt; Bank accounts --&gt; Credit card.  If it cannot retrieve funds from one source, it moves on to the next.  
Since OP stated his card was charged, this tells me that the first two options failed.  
If he returns the 20 BTC to his account, I would be happy to work with him to resolve the payment charges to his card.  
@_date: 2014-01-30 07:22:48
Edit: Found your case, it would appear that it has already been resolved in your favor.  PM me or reply to the resolved ticket if you have further unaddressed concerns.  
@_date: 2014-01-30 01:32:11
PM me your email address you used to register for CB with and I'd be happy to take a look!

No point in arguing with a guy too hung up on semantics. This reminds me of when my friends ask me "what price will you sell your bitcoin at??" And I reply "When the time comes, I won't have to."
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:43:15
Coinbase keeps their own backups.  Also, do keep in mind that even were Coinbase's server hacked, over 90% of funds are stored in offline cold wallets, whereas blockchain wallets are entirely online...
@_date: 2014-01-30 07:19:43
If the 20 BTC were on your balance, the server would have withdrawn them.  I have never seen it fail to do so when attempting to reclaim funds.  
Again, provide me with a case number and I will be happy to look into the matter further.  
@_date: 2014-01-30 18:20:32
Yes, BTCchina implemented their maker-taker fee structure...and this could easily be "legit" users trading between their own wallets in an attempt to game that system...
...Or it's their own bot magnifying any order placed, and then matching it with a tiny bit smaller/larger purchase/sale in the opposite direction to deliberately give the impression of volume (which I suspect Huobi does too, but in a far less obvious fashion by splitting the magnifying/matching orders up into smaller chunks)...
...But the end result is blatant volume manipulation either way.  
Edit:  Even better picture

@_date: 2014-01-30 08:35:58
I found your case.  It had already been resolved, significantly in your favor.  If you're still having problems with the resolution which was previously agreed upon, you are welcome to PM me or reply back to the resolved ticket for further clarification.  
@_date: 2014-01-30 01:49:33
He's welcome to give me a case number on his support ticket instead.  Not much difference to me.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:23:36
Sorry, can you ELI5 what this would imply?
Edit:  Nvm, found the current whois to compare to.  Interesting.  Lends further support that this is all FUD.  
@_date: 2014-01-30 07:17:54
You are welcome to provide me with a case number to show me otherwise!  
I am stating a fact when I say that the server will pull BTC as a first option, long before resorting to charging your credit card.  Since your card was charged, I can only conclude that the server was unable to pull the BTC from your account (as in, it was not there).  
Please PM me a case number to continue this discussion.  
@_date: 2014-02-12 11:08:39
You're awesome too &lt;3
+roll verify
@_date: 2014-01-30 04:17:17
If it was there, the server would have pulled it to cover the mistaken refund already.  Charging a credit card is a payment option of last resort, only used in the event that a user's account has a negative balance.
@_date: 2014-02-09 09:20:24
I see nothing of the sort.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:33:51
Here, I think this will help you understand what happened:
Basically, whenever bitcoin is moved from one address to another, ALL bitcoin on the originating address must be "spent".  The amount you requested goes to the address you requested, and the rest goes into a "change" address generated just for the occasion.  Your wallet software will manage the funds on the change address/keys for you without having to keep track of it.  
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:53:26
Did you miss the massive/obvious troll in this fake IRC chat...?
@_date: 2014-02-09 07:37:06
Hi there!  Sorry to hear you're having some issues.  
If you create a support ticket about this matter, and PM me your case number, I would be happy to take a look.  Alternatively you could simply PM me the email address you used to register your CB account with.  Either way is fine.  
@_date: 2014-05-22 17:17:35
You could've been nicer about it, but yeah, it's spelled out pretty clearly in the TOS.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:27:35
Thank you for the reply, I just saw the current whois to compare and edited my comment about 30 seconds before this!  Good sleuthing.
@_date: 2014-01-30 03:02:49
In this kind of scenario, the server's first action would be to retrieve the BTC in question.  
I have yet to get a PM from this guy, but it would appear that he withdrew the 20 BTC before the server could remove it.  Thus, his accounts were charged (because that put him at a balance of negative 20 BTC).  
I hear what you're saying, but if the guy had just left the BTC on his account, none of this complication would ever have occurred...
@_date: 2014-01-30 02:27:10
Got your PM; I've responded to you via the support ticket.  Thanks for getting in touch!
Turns out you don't actually have those BTC, it's just a display glitch, hopefully we can get it fixed ASAP.  Unfortunately, it has to be a fix on the engineering team's end; there's not much I can do from support.  
@_date: 2014-01-30 06:09:29
Edit: Found OP's original ticket.  The additional funds had been re-sold, but the matter has already been previously resolved.  
@_date: 2014-01-30 02:26:32
A ticket number provides zero risk to you to provide... only someone who knows what support platform Coinbase uses, and has access to it, could possibly obtain any personal information from it.  
Please PM me?  Still waiting on the response.  Thanks!
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:59:24
Hmm, did not know that.  I don't know enough about internet security to really comment on that; but that being said, Coinbase cold storage is pretty darned safe.  I keep a fair amount there myself.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:59:27
To...deliberately cause panic as the veracity of the FUD-material was not dispelled?  
Thus causing prices to drop, crazy low bitcoinbuilder.com ratios to be sold, and insiders with inside knowledge to get a ridiculous last-chance opportunity to scoop some SERIOUSLY cheap bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-06-02 13:19:44
Accidents happen... I screwed up a transaction just last week (after doing hundreds already).  Thankfully not only was it not a gamebreaking amount, but the recipient was kind enough to help me out.  I hope the same happens for OP...

As if that couldn't also be changed...
@_date: 2014-01-30 02:25:25
Already on the case sir!  Haven't received a PM yet, but when I do, we'll get it resolved.  
@_date: 2014-01-30 18:29:44
Well, if it's not, then the bots are losing money for whoever is running them. I sincerely doubt they'd be running them if that was the case.

There are alternate paths to the secondary protocol layer. Omni protocol, for example. 
Always remember that all crypto is just code. Anything one coin does, any other could copy or incorporate.
@_date: 2017-01-20 17:53:47
Ooh, I can fill in a blank here!  Too bad it's a somewhat useless one.  
"Willy" came to be named because of the like-clockwork buying pattern, regardless of price, slippage, spread, whatever.  It was being observed and commented upon in the TradingView chat, and someone typed "FREE WILLYYYYYY" (or close to that).  I even recall seeing it referred to as the "free willy bot" for a short period before the "free" part was dropped.  
However, I admit that although this was my first encounter with the name, it is possible that this is coincidence, or that someone from that chat had obtained the "Willy" name from elsewhere and brought it to TradingView by all-capsing the movie line at us while we pondered the trading actions of the bot.  
TLDR: Willy came from TradingView chat, (maybe user ronfkingswanson remembers better?), but I could be wrong.

Always good to ask this question; but in this case, he is quite correct.  Quantitative easing and zero interest rate loans are comPLETEly unknown and unproven strategies...
@_date: 2017-04-04 02:16:26
That is just ONE possible reason for the price going up right now.  There is a huge amount of money flowing into crypto in general right now; just about everything is going up.  Money-in is reason enough for the price to rise.  Additionally, I know several traders personally who have diversified into LTC and other cryptos over the past year as a hedge against the possibility of a messy fork scenario in Bitcoin.  
I'm sure there are some Segwit speculators who have bought LTC just for that reason, but again; money in = price up.  Doesn't matter the source of the money.
@_date: 2015-04-01 06:53:02

@_date: 2016-05-03 08:03:15
There are way better stories to spin if it's just simple market manipulation...besides, how can one guarantee what effect "satoshi" coming out would have? 
I am doubtful that was the sole goal.
@_date: 2016-05-03 00:29:14
He either:
A.  Is running an advanced, yet shaky, hoax on a number of people in an attempt to convince them he is Satoshi.
B.  Actually is Satoshi and is choosing to come forward in a most odd fashion to a select few in private, instead of providing very very simple to produce evidence to the public.  
I personally believe option B to be the less likely by far of the two, and am far more interested to speculate upon the reasons behind option A.  
@_date: 2016-05-03 20:34:11
I wouldn't.  If I was a billionaire I would simply use my massive bank account to manipulate the actual markets up or down directly on the exchanges.  Coordinate movements across a few, short squeeze the f*ck outta people shorting right now.  
@_date: 2016-05-03 23:37:26
Off the top of my head, announce you're satoshi, and also that you're about to release a "better version of Bitcoin after having watched and learned from the flaws and pitfalls of the original for 7 years."  
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:39:02
Could easily be Coinbase too if "In San Francisco" is the only info we're going on.
@_date: 2015-02-18 17:33:17
I think you are quoting mining stats for scrypt mining, not SHA-256.
@_date: 2017-07-12 20:32:01
Wait, I feel out of the loop. What is the class action portion you're referring to? I don't recall being notified of a separate class action ever, which I should have been if there's an opt-out clause...
An additional question if you would be so kind... It has become clear we will not hear anything about the biggest questions about missing Bitcoin from gox at this trial. Do you know when the earliest moment we might hear something more relevant would be?
@_date: 2015-02-28 21:14:05
If there was no one mining the blockchain, it would imply no one is using Bitcoin, which makes the argument pointless.  
But DaSpawn is correct.  As soon as your broadcast is picked up from the irc channel by another node, that bitcoin is spent.  It could get double spent before it is confirmed, and therefor fail, but that is up to the miners.  
@_date: 2017-07-12 22:38:16
Thanks very much for the link to the court records; I will check that out.  
I had previously viewed the Chainalysis video, but thanks for that link too, in case others have not seen it.  
If you are hopeful that more pertinent information will be revealed by year's end, then I shall remain hopeful as well.  I appreciate your sharing what you have been able to share, and wish to extend my continued appreciation as you continue to do so in the future, even if I don't chime in specifically.  
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:43:24
Happens to the best of us :-)
Does a good job illustrating the comparative difficulty in mining Scrypt vs SHA-256 tho!
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:27:19
Your whole premise RELIES on the current miners to jump ship to the UASF chain. If you're unwilling to consider that might not be the case, and don't view UASF success hinging on that as a problem, then I guess there's not much else to discuss. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:24:13
There IS the possibility, no matter what the %number may be. The only number that has a 0% chance of potential faking or fudging is hash power signalling. That's why the protocol was designed as such. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 03:54:04
It only increases transaction capacity for *transactions using SegWit*.  Normal non-segwit transactions are still subject to the same 1 mb base blocksize limit.  
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:04:24
You PM'd me too, didn't you!  I think I responded already via PM.  
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:36:34
Hi there!  I believe this is answered somewhere in our support section of the site (under Resources--&gt;Support) but I'm happy to answer here too!
Best place to go would be under "Account Settings". There will be a tab at the top that says "Bitcoin Addresses"  
You can use any of those addresses to fund your account with bitcoin, but I strongly recommend you generate a fresh address for your deposit.  It just makes things MUCH more clear on both ends, and essentially removes the possibility of an error occurring.  Good luck!
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:59:35
...Why?  Coinbase has some of the best 3rd party Bitcoin storage security in the business.  Only wallet company I know of that's never been hacked or had a security breach of some kind.  
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:36:23
Well, if you're using "Miners are using Asicboost, that's why they're against segwit" as an argument, it would help to be able to show they were doing so, wouldn't it?  
I personally don't have much stake in the matter.  Having looked into it at length; I don't think Asicboost is that big of a deal.  Other such optimizations already exist in different forms under different names and aren't viewed with such suspicion.  
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:05:01
If no one knows the private key to the address, then the bitcoins are lost forever.  
This is not a problem, because a bitcoin is infinitely divisible.  
If only one bitcoin were left in the entire world, the whole system would continue to function exactly as normal.  Except, instead of dealing in terms of whole bitcoins, or millibitcoins, we'd be dealing with like, pico-bitcoins or something.  
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:06:38
Hi there!  I'd be happy to answer that for ya.  
It'll take several business days for your order to arrive.  Because of Sunday, and then Thanksgiving next week followed immediately by another weekend, this particular week's purchases will be a few more "normal" days in coming.  
Please also keep in mind that these delivery/deposit dates are not perfect, they are just estimates provided by our server.  Should be pretty close to your stated time though!  Best of luck :)
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:31:16


Wow, way to be a dick. I haven't been around here recently, hadn't heard all this "obvious" knowledge. I just don't hear about asicboost outside of this sub.
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:15:06
Yes, it's normal!  Don't worry, you'll get your coins eventually.  There are simply a lot of restrictions that are in place, both for yours and Coinbase's safety.  
Once the US establishes a system to properly interact with cryptocurrencies, I suspect this will all get a LOT easier :)
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:39:38
So, the plan is, that by the time the network is completely mined of new blocks; enough people will be doing regular transactions and having fees enabled, that it will work out to be worthwhile for the miners still?  
Sounds good to me; that's what I suspected, but figured I'd ask.  Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:55:39
Right, but then the difficulty would go down, while those transaction fees pile up.
Someone would step up to the plate.
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:13:35
Whatever.  It's better than the current system.  Far more open, and far less exploitable.  Hard to have insiders when there is no "inside."  
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:34:57
&lt;3  I appreciate your kind words and support!  
The public bashing is designed to get our attention.  By damaging our reputation, they hope to get faster/special/whatever treatment.  I suppose I'm somewhat encouraging it by being active here, but eh.  I like my company :D
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:15:37
I escalated it.  Sorry no one responded.  It's been busy here.

@_date: 2013-11-22 14:14:05
I mean...100% of bitcoin are connected, all by the same network.  
BTC price is certainly being manipulated.  Go look at the huge sell or buy-walls placed up from time to time on the major exchanges.  But how is this different from any other currency or commodity?  People will always try to manipulate stores of value to be more favorable to themselves, if possible.  
With bitcoin, having no centralized focal point from which any large powers-that-be could exert undue control, this risk is highly mitigated.  What is a huge whale going to do to manipulate the price?  Set up a 1 billion dollar sell wall?  
Well, if the market decides the price should be higher than that sell wall, it'll just get eaten.  Might take a while to eat through a billion dollars, but the more that wall is holding back the price (on the ONE exchange the wall is on, mind you), the better deal it becomes for people to buy.  If the difference between that exchange and others becomes too great, people will start to arbitrage: super easy to do with bitcoin.  
I hope it's apparent that due to the de-centralized nature, anything that big money tries to do to game the system would only be a temporary set-back at best.  As more people and money enter the system, it gets harder to do.  In a few years, we will reach a point where a billion dollar sell-wall might just represent a speed-bump for the market to plow right over.  
Not to mention that Bitcoin is simply a base platform upon which better technologies are being developed.  Have you heard of Mastercoin, and its distributed exchange developments?  In a matter of months, we may not even NEED centralized exchanges to do maintain orderbooks for us.  We'll be able to do the whole thing from the blockchain.  
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:12:59
Coinbase Support here!
We're pretty safe.  If you read our user agreement, we can technically deny service to anyone we want to.  Everyone who has made an account with us has agreed to those terms.  
Note that Coinbase has been subpoena'd TWICE, and has passed inspection both times with flying colors.  If we were going to get in trouble, it would have been long ago.  
People just don't understand that we are not a bank.  We don't hold USD, we don't speculate, and that the reason so many people are being flagged as high-risk is because of scammers and money-laundering laws.  Our algorithm has to be incredibly strict, and we have to collect as much data as we can from our customers for legal compliance purposes.  
Government basically wants to make SURE that none of you are laundering, or financing terrorism.  That's why banks have to keep such detailed records/logs/loads of personal info.  We do the same just to be safe, even though we are not a bank.  We also do it to protect OURSELVES from scammers, of which we probably get several thousand a day trying to get in, either with stolen info or their own, buy bitcoin, transfer it out, and then call their bank to stop payment on the ACH transfer.  
Also keep in mind that all of our profit comes from the 1% fee we leverage on buy/sell orders.  If a customer defaults even 1% of the time, that customer is now likely a net loss for us.  So, we have to be SUPER strict.  
It's a mess, and creates a lot of hassle for the average innocent citizen trying to just invest a little money in bitcoin.  Unfortunately, it's a necessary evil at this stage in the game.  
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:56:28
Well, it's hard to provide solutions for problems that have not occurred yet.  
However, for all technical problems, there is generally a technical solution as well.  The tricky part is implementation.  I have faith that the bitcoin community is smart enough to figure out a way out of any potential problems on the technical side of things.  
@_date: 2013-11-17 02:07:33
I wouldn't exclude gold, or any wealth storage mechanism, from the Bitcoin crosshairs...

As was kind enough to link...
There was a software glitch last week that resulted in a large amount of orders/deposits/transfers being backlogged.  As far as I know, the system is still crunching through it.  
If you wait another 48-72 hours, we expect the system to be caught up by then.  
Please keep in mind that we are a small company.  We have about 10 support staff trying to manage 440,000+ customers (and growing exponentially!).  Many aspects of our system aren't scaling quite as well as we'd like.  When even small problems happen, they can affect a LOT of users simply due to the sheer volume of traffic we get on an hourly basis.  
Feel free to post your gripes on Reddit, but in most cases, simply submitting a support ticket and waiting for it to be answered is your best option.  We always strive to answer in a timely fashion, but as you can imagine...along with 440k customers comes a LOT of support requests.  
Starting soon(tm) we're rolling out a new feature where purchases or sales of BTC will cause your computer to pour you a dry martini while soothing jazz music plays from your speakers.  The martini is spiked with a powerful muscle relaxant that prevents users from having any seizures until their transactions have concluded.  This will hopefully greatly reduce our support ticket volume as well.  
In addition, our high-risk detection algorithm has been adjusted to include a teddy bear and a piece of chocolate along with the standard purchase-cancellation message.  When the bear is squeezed, a small speaker activates, and repeats, "Support will take care of you...eventually...I promise..." until you fall asleep.  
We hope these changes will help our customer base understand that we love you and are truly not trying to screw you over, as much as some may insist that we are!  Thank you for using Coinbase :)

But also a 100% chance of missing out until he DOES invest.  I don't see this price going below $800 ever again once we go beyond $1,000 for more than 24 hours in a stable fashion.  
Edit:  Hey OP, why not invest half of your planned purchase now, and then wait on the other half to see if it gos down?
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:22:30
Well, look at last May.  Crashed from 266 all the way to 50.  80% loss in value.  
And yet, here we are, now past twice that previous peak.  
My point is, that even if it does crash again (and it probably will at SOME point), just wait another 6 months and it'll be at twice the pre-crash price again.  Also, the markets are a lot more mature now.  If a crash were to happen, there are a LOT more people waiting to catch that falling price than there were.  
In my opinion, if you can get in before the price hits $10k/BTC, you're doing pretty well for yourself.  I'm in it for the loooong haul :)
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:58:28
Well that would explain why the volume of support tickets is still so incredibly high...
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:25:56
Hah, thanks for the support.  Yes, in every case that has been a false positive (aka person is NOT a scammer...) we've honored the original price.  
Unfortunately many scammers KNOW that, and harass us like CRAZY to whitelist their accounts...as if our decision is based on the volume of their complaint, and not on the actual verifiable data.  
It may take some time, but when we manually examine the cases, we are thorough.  Some scammers slip through even still, but that number is now quite tiny, and growing smaller.  The security-net is getting pretty good.  
Thanks again for your kind words :-)

Have you a link to the evidence that ASICBOOST is in use btw?  I was looking for it the other day and couldn't find any.  Ty in advance.
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:37:22
It's an estimate of 4 business days, with an additional up to 48 hours if we have to pull the bitcoin from cold-storage.  Probably the case, considering the amount of purchases we've been processing recently.  
If you still don't get it in another 48 hours, shoot me a PM with your coinbase email address and I'll take a look!
@_date: 2013-12-16 05:01:15
Damn straight it's not "real" money.  That's a good thing.  We'd much rather it be considered a commodity that can be traded for goods and services.  Keep us out of that whole massively regulated "currency" business.

THANK YOU for your attempts to bring sanity back into all this ridiculous hype over pretty much nothing...
@_date: 2013-11-24 07:31:39
Well, I guess I'll do one more before bed!  Here goes:
Because of the way Bitcoin functions, Coinbase is a frequent target of scammers attempting to use stolen bank account information.  As a result, we are forced to employ some fairly strict automated fraud prevention measures.  
All of the risk analysis of purchases is performed by our self-learning risk-detection algorithm.  Because of its fluid nature, it is fairly impossible to predict how it will react to any particular transaction on a given day.  
It is definitely not perfect, and does occasionally make mistakes.  We are constantly tweaking the parameters to hopefully catch fewer legitimate customers along with the massive amount of scams it does successfully prevent on a daily basis.  
I realize this can be a frustrating thing to deal with.  Especially considering how little information we can give out on exactly WHY a transaction is being considered high-risk.  If we were perfectly transparent about how the algorithm calculated the risk, then scammers would simply use that information to sidestep the system entirely.  
The only advice I can give you is to verify as much information with the system as possible before making your purchases.  If you do get inappropriately flagged, don't hesitate to contact us at support  We'll be happy to look into your case, and in most circumstances will be able to honor your original purchase price.  Thank you for your understanding in this matter.  Hope this clears up some misconceptions :-)
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:57:01
I see. Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:19:08
Umm...just about ANY business can turn down a customer.  And ANY bank can decide not to process your shit if they have reason not to.  
Coinbase's automatic fraud detection robot just needs some tweaking...relax man.  
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:37:31
Well, I haven't seen your ticket (PM me your email address attached to your CB account and I'll look), but I can already tell you that the order will not be restarted.  Orders that have had payments reversed simply cannot be manually restarted.  Sorry about that.  
The reason it's still pending is likely because the way ACH transfers work, and how slow they are.  3-days each way is pretty average (could be longer, rarely shorter).  So, a payment was made to us (as in, your account owes ACH money), then your account couldn't pay the debt.  So the money goes back to ACH.  Then ACH charges you an overdraft fee, and sends the money back to your account.  
Could take many days...unfortunately.  Welcome to the world of bank transfers.  
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:54:16
Not following your logic about how excitement and quick growth will lead to demise. The protocol itself hasn't changed barely at all since the start...
You didn't really supply any reasoning other than to state that it would.  Please elaborate?  
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:00:59
Hi there!  I work at Coinbase on their support team, but I'm currently off-duty at the moment, so I can't check for you now.  
Last week there was a software bug of sorts (I'm not one of the engineering guys) that resulted in a whole bunch of bank transfers being backlogged instead of actually going through.  
Last I checked, that backlog is still being processed.  Many of the orders had to be manually restarted, depending on how far along in the process they were.  
Sounds fairly likely that you were caught up in that mess.  Tell you what; if you PM me your account details (just need the email address registered, if you already have an open support ticket), I'll be happy to personally check your case out in the morning.  
In the vast majority of cases, we are able to get them going out again at the original prices that the transactions were bought/sold at.  
And yes, we are currently ridiculously swamped with support requests.  You'd be amazed at the nearly exponential rate at which our customer base is growing.  
Unfortunately, the support staff is not growing at quite the same rate, hehe.  We do our best to keep up though!  Apologies in advance if it takes a while to get to many people, we do try our best.  (And we're working on hiring more support staff asap!)  
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:58:54
No clue!  Wouldn't hurt to try.  
Good luck!
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:05:07
Shoot me a PM with your email address you registered your CB account with (I can't do anything without this, folks!), and I'll take a look!  If you haven't made a ticket via the actual support portal yet, please do so.  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:15:12

Whoa man, I'm replying here on my free time.  It's Thanksgiving, I have the day off!  
All my responses/replies/assistance offered on Reddit are on a volunteer basis.  
The reason no one's gotten back to you via normal support channels is because we are SWAMPED with tickets.  470k customers, most of whom are new to the whole technology, creates a LOT of support requests.  Our small team is quite overwhelmed.  We're hiring new support staff as fast as possible, but it's not like we have an HR department to do hiring for us.  Plus, it can be tough to find qualified applicants whom you can also trust with the personal information of nearly a half million people...
So yes, sometimes you can get a faster response on Reddit than normal support channels.  But really, that's only because I spend all my free time here, and don't mind helping out.  I mean, if it makes our support channel look THAT bad in comparison...I could just ignore all the Coinbase stuff here...
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:08:15
Unlikely, other than minor corrections to bring us more in line with a non-speculation boosted market price.  
There's simply too much money coming into the system for it to go down much.  Bigger money is on the horizon too.

I can't wait to watch Bitcoin flow into the financial vacuum that will be created like a flood.

Eh, I think there's a 15 cent bank fee on every transfer.  In addition to our 1% fee, that is.  Not much, but for tiny purchases it could add up.  
Still better than credit cards though.

@_date: 2013-11-20 16:00:17
Hi there!  
As a new member of the customer ops team for Coinbase, I can help you out with that.  
The reason your order was cancelled was due to strict automated fraud detections we have in place.  Coinbase is an incredibly frequent target for scammers attempting to buy bitcoins with stolen bank account information.  These automated systems are not perfect, and we are constantly tweaking them to lower the rate of false-positives they produce.  
PM me your email address and I'll take a look at your account!  Just keep in mind, we're currently SWAMPED with support tickets (400,000 customers managed by less than 20 people), so it might take some time before your case can be processed.  
Edit:  I have to leave for a while.  If you get PM me that email address, I'll take a look at it directly when I return, but in the meantime you should email support to add your request to the (enormous) queue.  Good luck!  Hope to resolve your case soon.  
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:48:25
The risk is that Bitcoin transfers are not reversible.  Bank transfers are VERY reversible.  Even long after a purchase has taken place.  A lot of scammers try to take advantage of that fact to defraud us of Bitcoin, hence the strict automated security meausres.  It's a risk to Coinbase, not necessarily to you.  
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:41:13
I'd also like to add; that at every point where bitcoins have been in the news, and lots of new people are looking at the price history chart...we've had lots of people sitting around waiting for a crash, saying "Oh, it's $30...I'll wait til it's back to $20."  Or, "Oh, it's $100...I'll wait til it's back to $80."  
Most of the time, it's never gone back to those numbers.  So, don't be one of the, "Oh it's $230...I'll wait til it's back to $200."  
It's probably not happening.  Could it?  Sure.  But, unlikely.  What's more likely is that 2 weeks from now, new users will be saying, "Oh, it's $300...I'll wait til it's back to $270."
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:30:57
Sorry, why would an audit cause a spike in the money-flow to Bitcoin?  Apologies if I'm missing something obvious...

Hiring qualified people who can perform a high-pressure, yet sensitive task while also being able to trust them with a LOT of people's personal info is no easy task...
...But hey!  If you happen to know about 50 people that match that description, PLEASE do send them our way :-)
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:50:20
Well, say some big guy wanted to keep the price under $700 for a while.  So, he puts up 10 million dollars worth of bitcoin at $700.  Anyone else who wants to sell has to undercut him slightly (he hopes), which will bring the price down artificially until the wall is gone.  
Now...if no such wall exists at other exchanges, and the market price keeps going up like it has been, then eventually the price will be $750...$760...$770 elsewhere.  Suddenly, all those bitcoin in the $700 sell wall on that exchange are looking like a pretty good deal.  So, people start buying through the wall.  "Eating it" as I put it earlier.  Thus the wall disappears, and price returns to normal.  
My point is that even if people try to manipulate, it's a temporary measure at best.  The larger the market grows, the less effective such manipulations are.  Keep in mind; every chunk taken out of that $700 sell wall is a LOSS for the guy who put it up there.  He's selling under market price.  
As for arbitrage, it's only hard because it's difficult to transition from one fiat currency to another at the moment.  Takes time, and exchange rate takes a small cut.  SUPER easy to buy bitcoin at one exchange and send it to another for sale though; especially if they both deal in the same fiat currencies.  So, I daresay it's easier to arbitrage bitcoin than just about anything else in the world at this time...
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:56:04
Found it!  Replied to you via that.  
@_date: 2013-12-17 08:20:39
Please don't take my word as gospel, but I work at Coinbase on support, and have yet to hear of any bank taking serious action against Bitcoin.  
We've heard the same stories of isolated cases of peoples accounts being closed at Chase, BoA, etc...but so far I think they've either been VERY isolated, or were just fabrications.  
If anyone has any evidence to the contrary, I'd love to see it!  Not trying to call anyone out, I'm just curious if this is actually a thing that's happening or not.  It DOES make sense that big banks would kind of be against the concept of Bitcoin...
@_date: 2013-10-24 17:02:36
I'm curious as to where the Europeans are buying their bitcoins too!  
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:22:21
After every major correction, once you got past the initial dip back down, the price has never gone back down to the initial value before the spike.  
Terrible terminology, but you get my drift.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:56:52
Thanks for the clarifications!  
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:04:39
You'll need a Visa Credit Card in order to utilize instant purchases at this time.  If you have that, once 30 days is up past your first purchase, you will be able to purchase 10 BTC instantly per day!
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:35:53
Please keep in mind Coinbase is NOT an exchange...the system is not meant to be used for daily buys and sells.  It's just an easy way for US customers to get USD into Bitcoin.  
If you want to day-trade, send your BTC to an actual exchange...

And it doesn't, when everyone else in the world DOES accept it.  
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:25:02
Ugh, I sympathize.  Unfortunately, until we either get a LOT more support staff (working on it), or the support request volume dies down some (unlikely but hopeful), any of the more complex cases that require more than a simple message or a quick fix will take several days to be responded to.  
I've also advocated for some sort of automated message to go out to tickets older than a couple days.  Hopefully something like that gets implemented too.  
Thanks for your patience!  I hope that your deposits arrive soon...but if several days pass and they still don't, don't hesitate to contact support again!  It might take us a while, but we'll do our best to take care of you :-)
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:07:40
Totally agreed.  Hopefully it won't become a necessity.  Overall, I think a well-run ETF would be an enormous boon to the Bitcoin economy.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:34:33
...because the price of Bitcoin is generally going up.  Tough to get a spontaneous better deal if the price is always increasing eh?
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:51:13
Newp!  The algorithm is pretty darned good these days.  I'd estimate it's accurate above 90% of the time.  I don't have any official stats in front of me, so I'm hesitant to say above 95%, but it's really quite good.  
We still get so many cases though, because CB now has a LOT of customers.  If even 1% of customers get flagged, and 10% of those flagged were false positives, that's 550 false positives.  
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:08:57
That's what I have mine set at. You realize that worked out to about 10 cents to transfer $10k+ nearly instantaneously, right?  
But hey!  If it's too much, just change it!  I just strongly recommend using &gt; 0.  
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:02:02
If they're in, they're safe from the potential financial singularity that Bitcoin could become.  Doesn't REALLY matter how they got there, imo.

@_date: 2013-11-26 19:53:19
Hi, Jeff here (on my lunch break)
All I can tell you is that if I told you I escalated it, I certainly did escalate it.  Higher-up either hasn't gotten to your case, or did something but didn't respond.

To give you some numbers to support your claims there, we went from about 50k customers to currently 446k and counting in a matter of a few months :-)
We did recently hire some new support staff...(me included!)...which brings us to...10?  Only 44.6k customers per guy, no problem!  XD

@_date: 2013-12-06 03:47:48
Well, unfortunately, "Safe" and "use easily" are kind of at opposite ends of the spectrum.  
The SAFEST way to store bitcoins is usually with a very hard to access method, such as cold storage on an encrpyted flash drive locked in a bank vault.  That's pretty safe.  But, hard to access.  
Easiest way to USE bitcoin would probably be some sort of web-wallet like the ones provided by blockchain.info.  Unfortunately, with web-wallets you run the risk of someone knowing/guessing your password and stealing funds, or the web-service itself being hacked and your funds being stolen.  It's rare, but it has happened in the past.  
I personally think Coinbase is a pretty good middle ground.  90% of their bitcoins are stored offline in cold storage wallets, yet if you want to access them, you simply have to log-in (I also recommend setting up 2-factor authentication), and request a bitcoin transfer to somewhere.  
So in reality you maybe want some combination of storage solutions.  For example, I store the majority of my coins on Coinbase, have a significant portion stored on an offline computer in my home, and have a small amount on a blockchain.info web-wallet that I can access via my smartphone app very easily.  All up to you!
@_date: 2013-11-24 07:42:32
Be careful using that.  Since Apple shut it down, we're unable to provide updates or support for that app.  As a result, improvements we've implemented elsewhere on the site or other apps will not be reflected in the iOS app.  
That doesn't mean it's broken or it can't be used.  As far as I know it's still completely functional at the moment.  We just can't take any responsibility for any potential problems that might occur from using it. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:42:37
Well, buying a bunch of bitcoin on Stamp, and sending it to Gox, and selling it would be easy.  It'd just take forever to get the USD out of Gox.  
If you're willing to wait, and have money in bitstamp already, then why not?  Go for it!  Send me a cut :D
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:38:21
 /shrug.  I'm capable of making such a statement.  I've been researching for a long time, and am thoroughly convinced that Bitcoin (or another crpyto) is the future of the financial system.  
You won't see me running around making dead-certain statements like that, but in my heart I believe it to be true.  I agree that such openly-displayed conviction can be a warning signal to many, and as such, I try to avoid doing so.  But keep in mind that the community around Bitcoin is very young (age-wise).  With youth comes the certainty and confidence of youth.  It's only natural for many people to want to speak in absolutes.  
In some ways I agree there too.  By hedging answers too frequently, it might make it seem that I share the doubts others are expressing.  It's a tough line to walk.  With my mom, I have to phrase my bitcoin talks on the foundation that her investment could go to $0 tomorrow.  With my friends who share a technical understanding on my level, we conduct our conversations on the foundation that Bitcoin is going nowhere but up.  
Very different tones.  It can be difficult to switch between them.  
Great little discussion we're having here btw!  Really shows how proper usage of English can have an enormous impact on the message being conveyed...especially tone.  :-)
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:21:04
Well, I'm headed to bed, so this is my last missive out to ya.  
I recommend you do what my equally busy friends/relatives have done.  
Just make a coinbase account, link your bank account, and buy like, $100 worth.  Or whatever you can afford.  
Then, just put it into storage and ignore it!  Go back to your studies :)  
If we're right, that $100 will be $100,000 in 3-4 years.  If we're wrong, well meh, you lost $100.  Either way, you won't have to spend any more time worrying/learning about it than you can afford!  Good luck man :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:18:14
I think this is the strongest argument out there for the need for a cheaper, more plentiful (in supply) alt currency, like litecoin.  
That and cheap arbitrage between exchanges, but we'd need some of the bigger exchanges to actually OFFER litecoin first...
@_date: 2013-11-17 02:04:50
That's $40k by today's standards we're talkin.  
If the buying power of the USD falls as Bitcoin gains, then the exchange rate will just skyrocket to match.  Could have a bitcoin be worth a billion dollars in the future, but maybe that billion dollars will only have the buying power of $40k in today's dollars.  
Either way, the buying power of bitcoin stays the same.
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:09:20
^  This guy knows what's up.  
It's not entirely unfair that people would blame Coinbase for "profiting" off of "holding" their money.  We do neither, because we're not registered as a bank.

Hello!  I think that would be more on a case by case basis...are you one of the people whose transactions are sitting around stuck at pending?  Or stuck at Complete and funds just haven't arrived at your bank yet?  
Or was your entire sale just reversed and no longer exists?  If the last one, you might have to manually restart it.  I'm not sure!  
How about you PM your email address, and when I'm workin in about 90 minutes I'll run a search for you and check it out?  
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:19:35
That's because Bitcoin is infinitely more steal-able and scam-able than stocks are.  Exchanges (and Coinbase) have to be SUPER protective of themselves, their other customers, and SUPER careful to not run afoul of money-laundering laws that don't quite quite *fit* onto Bitcoin.  The ambiguity makes it just that much harder to comply properly.  
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:09:42
Hi there, I'm off-duty, but I'd be happy to take a look at your account in detail tomorrow!  
From what I CAN see from here, I am not sure why you're unable to transfer your remaining BTC out...I see you initiating the transfers, and I see the server properly executing the send request...but then it kinda just re-appears with no apparent return or cancellation?  
Must be a bug.  I'll forward it to an admin in the morning.  You people making me work while I'm supposed to be browsing reddit!  :-)

Oh hey I recognize that name :D  Glad you got it fixed!  And sorry about that, not sure why your sale was included in that restart, but hopefully it won't happen again!
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:20:05
Unfortunately it doesn't look like they're using Coinbase itself to receive those funds.  Not sure there's much we can do about this one.  
@_date: 2013-10-17 19:41:06
Can someone explain what means with this post like I'm 5?  &gt;_&lt;
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:21:16
Some people are just determined to be unhappy...
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:16:45
If you're talking about the variable-price issue with the 24-hour rolling limit on bitcoin sales, we've actually made some recent changes which should hopefully prevent that from ever occurring again!  Hopefully :D
If you meant server capacity, it's a work in progress.  The customer base can do a pretty big bear hug when it wants to...
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:03:32
Hi there!  We're actually hiring for much more than just customer ops; you can check what we have available at:
Just please be aware that it may take some time to get back to you on your application.  Don't be discouraged if we don't respond immediately!  All support applications will be responded to in one way shape or form eventually(tm)  :-D

Depends greatly upon the day (and what the markets are doing) but anywhere from 1000-5000.  
(But I think on the day that the markets super-corrected downwards, we hit our all-time high of something close to 10k in a day!)
@_date: 2013-12-14 08:01:58
The problem is that we have to use pretty strict automated security measures to determine whether or not we should honor a purchase or not.  We're dealing with Bitcoin (non-reversible transactions) being paid for with bank transfers (extremely reversible transactions), so we're constantly under attack by scammers.  Sucks, but that's how it is.  
Say 1% of the customer base is flagged as high-risk, and say 10% of those are false positives.  That's 6000+ people complaining, maybe 600 of whom have a legitimate concern.  And since the price of Bitcoin is constantly on the rise, we get the: "Coinbase cancelled my order because the price went up!!!" and the "Argh Coinbase is losing me money!!!!" spiel all too frequently.  
We really don't care what the price of Bitcoin is, they didn't "lose money," they lost "potential profits," and everyone who sends in a ticket about high-risk cancels (eventually) gets reviewed.  If we deem them legit, we solve their problems and likely restart their purchases (given no extraneous circumstances).  If they didn't get help, there was probably a reason for that, and they need to please see sections 3.1 and 6.1 of the User Agreement.  
Thankfully, the ragers are quite small in number.  They're just very loud.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:04:14
H-uh!  That's not a bad idea.  
I'll forward this post to someone a bit higher up the ladder than I.  
Feel free to contact us at Support if you have any other interesting suggestions!  We're always looking for ways to improve our service :D
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:29:16
Not sure why you think we collect interest on your money while it sits with us.  
We don't do any investments with money.  We're not a bank, nor are we an exchange.  Nor are we registered as such.  
We are simply a broker of bitcoins.  We provide an avenue by which the customer can initiate a purchase via their bank accounts to purchase BTC.  That's all.  
Any misconceptions about us somehow profiting from slow transactions are just entirely incorrect... no offense.  It's easy to imagine that we ARE a bank, since we deal so frequently with money and other actual banks...
@_date: 2013-12-14 04:53:16
Haha, hopefully!  We always try our best; if it's possible to do, we'll do it.  Best of luck on those verifications!
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:07:04
Oh good!  Glad I could be of service :)
Have a good one, and enjoy the ride upwards on the bitcoin express elevator!  
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:42:25
The what lawsuit?  
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:37:16
Ah, please keep in mind that we currently have about 10 support staff processing 446,000 customers worth of support requests each day...and it's been especially crazy ever since the big market spike downwards a few days ago.  I assure you our team is working VERY hard to get to everyone in a timely fashion...but when you receive sometimes ten THOUSAND support tickets in a day, it is sometimes impossible to get to everyone.  
I'll check in the morning!  Thanks for your understanding :)
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:22:23
Imagine you called up a farmer, and arranged to buy a pig.  The farmer and you agreed on a price, and so, you hop into your car and drive to the farm.  
Upon arrival though, you find the gate locked, and the farmer is not home.  
Did you lose a pig?  No, you never got the pig in the first place.  Any theoretical profit you may have lost was just that:  theoretical.  
If you think you were flagged as high-risk by accident, try emailing support at Support  They'll be happy to manually review your case, and will likely even honor your original purchase.  
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:31:55
Newp!  I'm just a friendly tech support guy volunteering some time answering questions on reddit in my off-time :)
Apologies if anything I said sounds inaccurate (it probably is), I tried my best to explain things as far as my knowledge extends!  Admittedly, that's not very far &gt;_&lt;
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:17:06
...I just said, they could increase that decimal limit quite easily.  They can be divided much further than what MillerMan6 just said.  
@_date: 2013-12-14 08:34:51
Well, you're welcome to your opinions.  Happy Holidays!
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:51:24
Oh, what I was trying to say was that, given the same amount of confirmations, Litecoin is easier to spoof than Bitcoin.  That's why Litecoin requires (by default) more confirmations to consider a transaction "safely legit."
Apologies if I was unclear!
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:03:19
Hi there!  Coinbase Support here.  
So, we are aware of the problem.  What happened was we attempted to do a batch-restart on a small list of transactions that had become "stuck" for some reason or another.  Just sitting around pending for a week+ for no obvious reason.  
Along with those transactions, that restart command got applied to a bunch of other already completed transactions as well.  We're still looking into it.  
As far as we can tell, we've since taken the appropriate steps to cancel false-restarts that were pending, and have made debits on the accounts of people to whom the money had already been sent...but we're still investigating.  
No fears!  We'll eventually hunt down every last one, but until then, I recommend not withdrawing all your funds and running; you might be hit by an overdraft charge when we the correcting debit hits your account! 
If you PM me your email address you used to register with CB, I'd love to take a look just to make sure that you were included in the fix we deployed earlier!  Thanks for reporting the issue :-) 
Sorry for the inconvenience...if anything, I hope this proves to some of the angrier folks that we DO in fact make mistakes that benefit the customer.  
...Now back to manually selectively cancelling buy-orders in which the price of bitcoin has gone up in the meantime!  Oh wait, that's every order   &gt;_&lt;  
To the moon!
@_date: 2013-12-06 07:19:25
See:  The Fed and QE.  
Boy are those fireworks gonna fly when that taper starts.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:18:39
Sounds good!  Or you can email support  I'm not always around to check my PMs here on Reddit, but it helps to have an open ticket in the support queue so if you do PM me here, I can just run a quick search and find your ticket, and go from there.  
Thanks for using Coinbase!
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:59:37
Wow, you sound like me.  I've never had such motivation to cook all my own meals, drive as little as possible, or work as much as I am now :D

Only because I spend all my off-time browsing Reddit :D

Oh man, that would have been PERFECT.  
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:11:47
At any given point in time, the developers of the bitcoin protocol could simply increase the number of decimal points a single bitcoin goes to.  Read up on it!
@_date: 2013-12-14 08:55:50
Aww, that's so nice of you to say!  And you're welcome!  
Don't feel bad; when people are dealing with money and things go wrong, it tends to get emotional.  And really, with the price constantly on the rise, I can see how people could easily find our cancellations to be quite suspect indeed.  
Hehe, but when it DOES go down, I bet you'd laugh if you could see how suddenly the buy-cancel people go quiet as a mouse, and people with pending sales suddenly clamor for us to cancel them...
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:29:33
I hear ya.  I pray that the US will hop on board with some actual legislation soon too...would love to know where I stand.  And if I should be making plans to move out of the country or not :-)

I don't see why people don't understand this.  It's the same amount of wealth exchanging hands, no matter what currency you're using.  
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:33:43
Key quote here: "Yeah to ME though,"
If you haven't been looking into it for years now, and seeing what it truly can do (and please investigate the possibilities of the secondary protocol layer being build on top by Mastercoin/etc), then why do you assume that people who have are being naive/zealots?  
I'd say that makes you....naive?  No offense meant, but you should examine your viewpoint to make sure it's fair. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:48:09
I don't need to convince you.  You seem pretty convinced already.  
I was just using the BTC-e order book as an example, because I had a screenshot handy. 
Have a nice day!
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:31:24
I actually closed my account earlier this year and put the whole thing into Bitcoin.  Not a single regret.  
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:26:40
 /sigh
Coinbase does not store any funds in USD.  The reason your funds are tied up is because of the ACH banking system.  With approximately 3 days duration each way, you can see how even if the turnaround time on a cancellation was instantaneous, it could still take a week to get back to your account.  Because Coinbase is not registered as a bank OR as an investment fund (it is simply a broker) they certainly don't "play the market" in any way shape or form.  All profits come from the 1% transaction fee on buys/sells.  With that in mind, it is IN coinbase's favor to DO as many transactions as possible.  Why on earth would they purposefully deprive themselves of their only source of income?  
Did you even TRY to email support about this?  I work at Coinbase.  PM me your email address you used to register your account and I will personally take a look.  
Frankly though, I think you're just being unrealistic and rather impatient.  All I can do is answer questions and offer to help to the best of my ability (during my free time, I might add, certainly not getting paid to browse reddit).  Up to you to accept either one.  
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:59:00
Not to mention that the positions we're hiring for also involve essentially blank-check trusting that employee with the personal and bank account information for hundreds of thousands of people...
It can be quite tough to get new people in the door.  We're definitely trying though!  I know we just had another round of interviews 2 days ago!  Hopefully we have some new faces very soon :-)
@_date: 2013-12-31 07:42:03
Hey there; happy to direct you towards the guy who gave me the info.  Here's a link to his business page:
Just so you know, he doesn't come cheap.  He was kind enough to give me a free mini-consult by phone, but he does have a steep retainer for any actual business being done ($5,000 upfront if memory serves).  
Best of luck!
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:15:45
God, what a bitchcoin, losing all its value like that over a few restrictions...
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:47:06
I hope you will understand that there's often very little correlation, time-wise, between initiating a deposit and the deposit hitting your bank.  There is a LOT of space between those two events where delays can occur.  
I assure you, if we could have it work super-fast and smooth every time, we would be SOOO happy to see that happen :-)
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:19:30
+1 for Olaf.  
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:00:34
Keep in mind, the number of pieces a bitcoin can be divided into can be increased at will by the devs/mining community.  A bitcoin is technically infinitely divisible.  
The current smallest unit is .00000001, and will probably remain that way for some time.  No reason to extend it until necessary.  
@_date: 2013-12-17 08:38:48
No, we do occasionally have issues with sales.  Sometimes bank transfers get delayed, sometimes sales false-start or get refunded to the customer for no reason...etc etc.  
You just rarely hear about those issues because the price of bitcoin is generally going up.  So people usually don't mind their orders getting canceled very much.  
We also have a lot more purchases being made than sales.  Not only that, but purchases are subject to scrutiny by our risk-detection algorithm, which does cancel about 1% of transactions to high-risk.  1% might not sound like much, but when you have 650k customers, it adds up.  Those folks tend to be pretty...vocal in their displeasure.  If price is going up, it's because they wanted bitcoin at the old price.  If it's going down, it's because they wanted to sell it earlier.  
So yeah, most of the problems you'll hear about on Reddit are from purchases.  99% of customers don't have any issues, but it's rare to see THEM posting about their uneventful transactions on here :D
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:57:56
I hear ya, I do.  
We DO respond via the support channel, as fast as we can...it's just not quite fast enough.  If the average ticket takes 5 minutes to answer, and we work 8 hours a day, that's...just shy of 100 tickets per person, per day.  On a busy day, getting what, 5k tickets, we'd need 50 support staff...
That'd be 3 times the size of the ENTIRE staff currently.  5 times the size of the support crew.  
Like I mentioned, we're hiring more people as quickly as possible, but I think it'll be a while until we can catch up.  Until then, we just gotta work with what we have, I guess.  
I appreciate your understanding.  All I can ask for is patience &gt;_&lt;
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:55:18
Lazy.  Welcome to the internet.
@_date: 2013-11-17 05:09:32
Oh I certainly don't think it's going anywhere.  
But, with an alternative limited supply commodity like Bitcoin available for wealth storage...wealth storage that's FAR more liquid and convenient...I suspect that gold prices may drop more than a little, if demand for it drops.  
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:48:51
Unfortunately our wait time on support tickets is kiiinda about that long for anything that requires more than a basic response.  We're working on that problem from several angles.  
PM me your email address you used to register your CB account with and I'll take a look when I'm off work and have time.  
@_date: 2013-12-08 14:11:48
I think he was just more aghast at the fact that none of them even seemed to care enough to LEARN about what Bitcoin really was.  They discovered market charts, and just stopped right there.  
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:18:20
Good lord...dat english.  Hope no one falls for that kind of a blatant scam...
I'm not sure there's much we can do about it, but I'll report it to the higher-ups anyways.  Thanks for the heads up!

Just wait til this international bond market bubble, the stock market bubble, and the real estate bubble in China all collapse around the same time...Oh how the bitcoin will flow into that collapse.  
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:25:58
Hahaha how ironic.  I found your ticket, and I was the one who responded to you in the first place.  My answers were honest the first time around, and I've echoed them in my comments in this thread already.  
Well, I've responded to you again.  But in a nutshell:  
Your cancelled purchase couldn't be restarted because the refund had already been sent out to your bank.  Bank transfers are external events, we have no control over them.  
I don't think you'll have further problems from the risk algorithm going forward in any case.  
And again, Coinbase does.  not.  store.  USD.  We are not a bank.  Your money is in transit.  Complain to the ACH if you're still having difficulties getting over that part.  
Please read the user agreement you agreed to abide to by making an account on our site.  You can find it here:
If you really can't deal with the way we do business...well, you're free to do business elsewhere?  We strive to provide the best service we can, but we ARE a busines, and we have to take measures to protect ourselves from scammers too.  
You have a good day meow.  
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:57:00
I'm not downplaying your points, but I'd just like to point out that Bitcoin can do everything you just mentioned, and MUCH more (See: Mastercoin and the 2nd protocol layer), for even LESS cost.  
Definitely a lot of room for advancement in those areas still.  
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:08:22
...I see you had a ticket open about this already, and already got a response back.  Let me know if you're still having issues.
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:31:18
Hmm.  I'd probably need permission to do that, and I'd definitely need a higher-up on hand to help me answer the tougher questions/make sure I'm not answering questions I'm not allowed to answer.  I'll ask!
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:10:37
You know, you can also convert bitcoin into other goods and services too...
...Might be a better way to "cash out" than trying to get fiat for it.  
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:50:40
This is a good idea!  Another example of our system needing some upward scaling after just a few months of market growth...Oh bitcoin, you crazy.  
I'm going to bed now, but I'll be sure to forward this to someone more important than I in the morning.  Thanks for the suggestion!  Feel free to send any more to Support
@_date: 2013-12-16 07:14:16
No idea, but that's a good point.  In some countries that tax might be large...
Whatever.  Governments need to make a new category for cryptocurrencies.  They really don't fit into any of the current square holes that exist at the moment.

Coinbase Support here!  I'm off duty but I'd be happy to take a look into your case.  
Was pretty easy to find with your amusing and creative language.  I want to apologize for how slow support responses have been.  We're hiring more staff as fast as we can, but we'd need to literally quadruple our entire employee base to keep up with the volume of tickets we're getting at the moment.  
I'll PM you more details when I've finished investigating your case!  Thanks for your patience and your sense of humor in regards to these issues.  Hope we can get you fixed up soon!  See you in PM-land...
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:47:04
Sure, I'll just pull some out of my hat!  
In all seriousness, we're hiring as fast as we can.  You can't just pull any old person in off the street and give them access to the personal/banking information of half a million people.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:55:54
Ah; so basically, it would add a 20% surcharge to their purchase, which would then be applied towards purchase of extra bitcoin.  
That makes a little more sense!  Thanks for the suggestions, I know for a fact we've got a higher-up who is taking a look at this thread to see if we can use any of it in our business.  Have a great day!
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:37:55
Because the blocks are easier to produce, it also means they are technically easier to spoof.  Every confirmation decreases that possibility exponentially.  Since the starting possibility is higher than that of Bitcoin, you need more confirmations to reach the same level of security in the transaction being legit.  
But really the odds are so low...and even one confirmation decreases the odds to an almost negligible amount.  
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:15:41
Just keep in mind we don't browse reddit as part of our jobs!  We've got PLENTY of support tickets to handle while we're on duty.  I'm essentially volunteering my off-time by responding here.  I don't mind, but I REALLY don't want to get people in the habit of using as their personal Support shoutbox...
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:57:48
Eh, fair enough, but the number of people who seem to be blindly downloading this off of a sourceforge link is just...irresponsibly high.  
@_date: 2013-11-03 23:55:29
Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:07:17
I highly recommend against having your bank reverse payment.  
Unless you want your account to be potentially auto-banned from future purchases of course.  
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:56:33
There's a big difference between .001 and .0001 btw :)  
You can change the amount you send along with your transaction as a miner's fee in the settings of your bitcoin-QT client.  You could even make it 0, but I don't recommend it.  Your transaction will be VERY slow to post and confirm if 0.  
Also, put it into perspective.  How much would you have been charged to make an international wire transfer of $10,000 (10 BTC), and how long would THAT have taken?  
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:03:28
If we were cashing you out (as in, giving you cash for your bitcoins), your sale price is locked in when you hit the button.  
Not understanding your complaint.  More info please?  Or PM me your email address and I'll explain it better to you.  
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:15:56
Coinbase support here:
Try calling your bank to see if they've arrived, but are just not posted on your banking statement.  Banks frequently seem to not list tiny deposits like that.  
Note, it does sometimes take up to 4 days for some banks to actually process that they've received them...but yeah, call them, they should know.  If they're not there, restart the verification from your user-page.  
Good luck!
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:51:24
Ahahaha Coinbase.com = Coinbase Comics that's priceless.  Thanks for the laugh :D  
@_date: 2013-12-14 08:05:41
99% of customers use our service and have zero issues.  You're suggesting we inconvenience the 99% in favor of the 1%?  
I see your point, but it's just not happening.  Our hiring is ramping up quickly, and we're implementing new features to both the front-end and the back-end of the support system which should greatly reduce the overall number of tickets.  We'll be caught up and back to under 48 hour responses pretty soon.  
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:07:13
It just depends on whether or not you want to take the burden of responsible Bitcoin storage-security into your own hands or not.  
If you're confident in your ability to create a suitable cold-storage (or not cold-storage, I have no idea if you need them soon or not) solution, then go for it!  
I personally trust Coinbase with my Bitcoins, and thus store a large portion of my own investment directly on my account there.  I have 2-factor authentication on my account and an extremely secure password.  
All up to you!  
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:33:07
If it peaks at 10k and falls to 1/4 at $2500, he's gonna be pretty sad he didn't hop in now...
@_date: 2013-11-17 02:09:12
Oh, it'll be the same for $1,000, and $10,000, and $100,000 too :)
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:52:54
Because ACH.  
When we make a charge to your account, ACH pays us 3 days after we make the charge, while simultaneously debiting your bank account for that amount (your bank owes ACH the money, because they already paid us).  
When we pay you, we send the funds to ACH
ACH does not offer you the same money lending service for sales.  Instead of crediting your account as soon as they get our payment order (3 days), they spend another 3 days sending it to your bank before your bank processes it and credits your account.  
So you see the archaic system tends to favor merchants rather than the end-user.  Sucks, but that's how it is.  
This is why we need Bitcoin in the world...
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:50:50
I wait with bated breath.  
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:30:23
As far as I know?  Sorry, I can't tell you for sure.  All I know is that we are still pretty swamped with tickets, and our customer base is still growing at an ever faster rate...
Good luck!

Oh I'd say it's more than a little sketch.  Good detecting, detective.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:25:00

@_date: 2013-11-17 14:50:21
That guy's just trolling.  I've seen him around quite a lot recently.  Not sure what his game is, but less experienced bitcoin-ers (who don't have full faith in the eventual dominance of cryptocurrencies) might get their knickers in a bunch  :)
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:49:25
Well, the transaction volume is increasing at a pace that matches the price pretty well.  See charts:
Pretty solidly linked to my eyes.  
As for transaction fees; yes the block rewards are decreasing, but as the price of each individual coin increases, it tends to compensate that quite heavily.  And remember, this system is designed to run out of block rewards eventually anyways.  in 2140, the ENTIRE mining economy will be driven by transaction fees.  I do not foresee this to be a problem.  
To your last bit, I agree that if everyone stopped using it, it would be worthless.  However, it's been around 4 years, is definitely not disappearing anytime soon, and in my eyes, has enough momentum to create a truly significant market cap within a year.  The "gravity" of all that wealth within this fantastic transaction system with all the financial utility it provides should keep Bitcoin thriving far into the future.  
Thanks for elaborating, and having this discussion!

You've got it perfectly correct!  Maybe you should apply for a customer ops position :D
Yes, when Coinbase goes over the 24-hour rolling limit on bitcoin purchases, we enter a variable pricing mode, where orders can still be placed...but will receive an amount of bitcoin relative to the market price at the time and date specified.  
We're hoping to be able to remove the 24-hour limit soon, but the customer base is growing at a rate that we can hardly keep up with as is!  It remains an unfortunate necessity for now.  Thanks for all of your patience while we work to improve our system!

Um, you're quite wrong.  Most of the money and development is happening outside of the US.  
The US making it illegal would simply push all legitimate bitcoin related business out of the States.  The rest of the world (and people illegally in the US) will continue to put plenty of money in.

Coinbase is not an exchange.

Ah man.  I feel your pain.  
Now feel mine as hundreds of users a day accuse us (Coinbase) of "holding their money" while in reality it's just being slowly transferred from bank to bank via the ACH system...
Seriously ACH?  3 days each way?  Welcome to the electronic age please?
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:43:51
Nope!  Hi there, I work at Coinbase.  
Under your account page, go to "Settings" and click the tab that says "My Bitcoin Addresses"  
Any of those addresses can be used to deposit funds into your account; but I do recommend just hitting the "generate new address" button for a new deposit.  Makes things clearer on both ends.  Check the support documentation for more information!  
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:45:15
Ho ho ho, I can only speak for the support staff, but I guarantee you there is ZERO waiting around.  We are answering tickets as fast as we can type!  And it's still not fast enough &gt;_&lt;
But ya, slow ACH bank transfers do cause a lot of headaches and impatient customers.

Moore's law will solve the vast majority of those problems.  Keep in mind it wasn't too long ago when a 1 terabyte hard drive was considered SOOOO HUUUGE.  How would we ever need so much space?  
I have USB flash drives from less than 5 years ago that measure their data storage in megabytes, instead of gigabytes.  
Improvements to the way data is stored in the blockchain will also alleviate much of this problem, since we DO want it to be as small as possible.  
Finally, it is totally not necessary for the vast majority of users to operate from a full node, or to carry around a complete blockchain at all times.  Things like Multibit or web-wallets will suffice for the vast majority of small transactions people make.  For large amounts being stored or transacted, you'll probably want a full node though.

I don't even think it will.  Look at that huge wall of bids at 220.  I'll bet that's echoed across the exchanges.  If there's a wall of that size at 220, how big do ya think the wall at 200 is?  Hah.

Okay, I can tell you that you've done the right thing so far by keeping money in your bank account.  
What happened already was that the server tried to charge your bank account, got a reversal (that's your bank's fault, not ours), then tried to charge your credit card, which failed, so your credit card was removed automatically.  
The server is likely going to try another bank transfer within a few days.  DO NOT remove the cash, or you're very likely going to get an overdraft.  
If you PM me your email address that you used to register for your CB account, I'll be happy to write it down and check your account later when I'm working.  Word!

At any given point in time, the developers of the bitcoin protocol could simply increase the number of decimal points a single bitcoin goes to.  
Those decimal places go on for quite a long ways :)

It takes 1 week for your bitcoin to arrive after your first purchase.  Soon as you see them, you can start to order 10 BTC a day, if you like!

If a business (or ETF) has shady un-sustainable business practices, it will fail.  
Bitcoin itself will be fine.

Yes, ideal for liquidity.  Unfortunately, also ideal for huge whales to be able to manipulate the price with huge buys or sells without having to pay any fees for doing so.  It makes it so that if you could spend a million dollars to make $10,000 it would be worth it.  Whereas, if there was say, a 1% fee, that would not be worth it as the fee would eat that entire profit.

Hi there!  Coinbase is in California.  We'll likely start the Black Friday no-transaction fee sale in 1.5 hours :)

Uhm, no.  Sorry, but you have no idea what you're talking about.  It happens ALL the time, especially on BTC-e.com.  
Guy puts up a huge sell order, people are watching the graphs and not the orderbooks, and all they see is the price bumping up against a ceiling, and not going any higher.  So, they panic, post sales under that ceiling hoping to get out before what they see as a potential pre-cursor to a crash, etc etc, and the big whale just buys up all their sell orders under his.  
There's definitely a purpose to the wall.  If it works, the whale is just sitting there buying up cheaply posted sell orders.  He's probably also got a huge buy order placed a short distance under his sell wall as well, to catch any large sales posted directly to market.  
See this example on the BTC-e.com litecoin orderbook for a classic example:
Soon as that particular guy thought he had done what he set out to do, he just removed both walls, and went about his day.

We have the power to decide.  The bitcoin developers are the ones who make upgrades to the protocol.  They send out the updates, and the miners (who power the system) "vote" with their mining power.  If more than 50% of the mining power available goes towards the upgraded version, it will be adopted.  
When I say "adopted", I am referring to the fact that the value Bitcoin has is due to its utility.  A majority of this utility is simply the fact that there are a lot of people using the system.  If a proposed change was not accepted by the majority of miners; then the blockchain forks.  Since the majority of miners (and therefor users) remained on the old one; it has more utility than the new.  Since this thing was designed to self-sustain on nothing more than market forces, theoretically the "upgraded" version will die.  
So far, all changes have been minor enough, or just straight up improvements, so there has been very little quarrel.  I severely doubt the devs will ever proceed with a change that the vast majority of the community is opposed to.  
So, I assure you, the liquidity of the system is in no way compromised by overall supply decreasing once we max out on new bitcoins.  
But, you don't have to take my word for it.  This is a fairly common question that is answered frequently on other message boards (and I'm sure here on Reddit too).  If my answer is unsatisfactory, go ask elsewhere.  I'm not sure if I can explain it any better than I have.  I recommend bitcointalk.org as a good place to have questions answered, or search for questions previously answered.  
Good luck!
