Fiat is destined to go the way of the dinosaur, you can only string along infinite debt so long. It's collpase is eventual. Bitcoin will be what survives the wreckage.

Same here lol. I'm enjoying the low buy in. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 08:36:05
Your doubt is the cause of my post. So I am not surprised why you would class myself with the likes of you. Bitcoin is the future, it is not a day stock. I  not cut as the same cloth as the likes of you. Please refrain from such accusations if you are able to muster the discipline of course. I am doubtful.

Enough of the FUD. Calm down 
@_date: 2018-05-12 04:32:12
The price is irrelevant if you believe in the future of Bitcoin. Who cares if the price drops a little bit if you know it will be millions in 2020?

Calm down pussy
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:30:41
Great attitude! Alot of people who are freaking out over the price if it drops or raises day to day are short sighted. Bitcoin isn't about a getting rich scheme. It's about investing in the future. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:27:01
Congratulations! That is a great start. Your average person can't just buy a full Bitcoin right out so you are being very smart in your investing! .1 at a time and you will get there. It's a great feeling investing in your future. Good luck with your Journey! May The Prophet John McAfees uneaten dick be with you!
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:28:18
Not everyone has the money to go all in. 9k can be alot for some people. The important thing is people are waking up and investing in a future not ruled by Fiat and Central Banks
@_date: 2018-05-12 21:18:10
They would be less frustrated if they looked at Bitcoin for what it is, instead of what it's not. They need to see Crytpos like how Gold and Silver work. Not like the stock market.
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:39:54
Because fiat is dependant on debt and we can only have a global system of debt for so long before the scheme is up and the world population revolts

If you are too weak to hold bitcoin you can get out now. Trust in the Prophet McAfee.
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:50:11
I don't know why people are so concerned with short term gains. Realistically the price won't change that much until technology catches up to push block chain to the next step where "Normies" will be able to easily access cryptos. The sad truth is most people are low IQ and don't understand technology or it's implications. The internet has been around since like the 70s and 80s... but it wasn't widely accepted until maybe the 90s and didn't explode until the 2000's. It's important that we have patience and stay focused. Bitcoin will skyrocket but it won't be overnight. Just slowly accumulate bitcoin and don't look at the price. Think of it as an investment that will payout in the future, if you get caught up in day trading or selling every time you feel FUD you will get tore up with paying taxes on it.

I'm guessing you bought BTC during it's peak and got hosed in 2017? You either believe in Bitcoin or you don't. You only proved that you don't have strong hands or discipline to follow through with waiting for block chain tech to revolutionize the world and Bitcoin with it. I know you are trying to come off as edgy and so much more enlightened than us HODL'rs... But you just come off sad and butthurt. Bitcoin and Block chain are the future.

Well and Bitcoin being a Million dollars haha 
@_date: 2018-10-15 17:56:29
They have been historically known to hold value.  That is why they are called a storage of wealth. You must be new to this. Gold and Silver and Land have for as far back as we have recorded history have always held value. Land on the ocean has always been coveted. A lake front home has always been valuable or by any water source like a river. I know you are wanting to come off hip but unless you can tell me how I'm wrong otherwise I don't see what more you can add to this conversation. I don't see many agreeing with you that those things I mention do not hold value. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 23:52:39
You can't edit the blockchain... it's an open ledger....
@_date: 2018-10-13 19:32:35
I mean if a shitcoin does last think of it like it's the Mexican Peso... it's only used in Mexico. it's not bad if you need shit in Mexico like beer and strippers it comes in handy. Now Bitcoin is like how the USD is currently nations use it to trade for all things especially oil. it is valued more than the Peso. You can Exchange 1 USD for way more Peso. You can use that Peso for the utility of beer and strippers in Mexico. That is kind of how shitcoins will work. Bitcoin can be converted to other utility tokens. But for most things Bitcoins value will be so dominant transferring wouldn't really always be needed 
@_date: 2018-10-13 19:26:43
Agreed. 100%
@_date: 2018-10-11 05:32:03
That isn't a huge dump... it's barely even noticeable. Bitcoin is fine. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 20:47:15
Think about it. if the world economy crashes and is no longer useable what will we do? We have the answer. Venezuela crashed because of their awful policies and they have to use cryptos or gold to survive. If the Worlds economic system of debt falls into itself the World will fully adopt Bitcoin because it can't be inflated, it must be earned with time and money through mining and its already been adopted by alot of people. Bitcoin will not only survive but thrive!
@_date: 2018-10-13 19:52:37
If any Crypto truly takes off in a big way that means it is the new Economy meaning Fiat would be dead. Have you forgot why we all love this technology... we want to end Fiat end the Fed.
@_date: 2018-10-15 19:49:04
The reason why we like it is it's not regulated... We don't want Central Banks, Corporate shills and Government bureaucrats dictating how we live our lives and how to spend our money and robbing us because of said "regulations" Bitcoin and the Block chain is freedom! You can't run into bull traps if you don't sell... pretty easy solution. HODL
@_date: 2018-10-15 17:47:17
I mean that is what they are SUPPOSED to do. But obviously not all do. Stocks and Cryptos go up and down. The only 100% investment is Land, Gold and Silver from the top of my head. But if you believe in block chain and you believe in Bitcoin then it's a good investment. I don't expect returns tomorrow or next month or even next year. But in time I truly believe I'll sky rocket profits from my investment.
@_date: 2018-10-29 00:20:17
More scarce + more desired = more valuable. What would happen is we would trade satoshis like we would a penny. you can break up a dollar into individual units if needed. We just need to wait for the technology to catch up. it's not that people don't have bitcoin it's that is hard for normies to get a hold of bitcoin. As you all know it takes alot of time and effort to purchase bitcoin off if an exchange. In time it will get easier as tech makes it easier to buy and trade. We are in the very beginning stages of bitcoin. just think in the 70s very few people had computers. Now everyone does. in the 90s very few people had the internet. Now everyone does. Cellphones in the late 90s early 2000s very few people had them. Now everyone has them. It just takes patience man. Believe in block chain and bitcoin and Hodl. See you when it hits a million! I'm in no hurry. I'll be here when it happens. Just happy to be at the start of something world changing :D
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:17:14
Where are illegals getting the money to buy bitcoin??
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:10:38
I love the FUDs just let people sell so we can buy low. If people are weak they don't deserve to be strong when bitcoin inevitably goes ATH in 2021 when it reaches 1m like McAfee predicted. No real investor sees 20k usd as the end game. We invest because it's the next greatest mark in our future. Block chain is the future. We just have to wait for it to catch up. Think of us like where internet was at 1995... Nobody used it but a few nerds. Now it is integral to society. Bitcoin and block chain are the same way in that regards. Let the weak sell and the strong invest in a better future.
@_date: 2018-03-31 16:59:20

I agree,  if we go down to sub 4k after the rally we will never get a chance at these prices so when it happens we need to move fast. I think summer will stay low but this fall should rally pretty big
@_date: 2018-03-31 16:56:25

Apparently you have no clue about China's new currency backed by gold who made a deal with Russia and Iran to only trade in that currency. You are about a week behind with that news.

@_date: 2018-03-31 03:00:32
I don't know why you are freaking out. Even if it goes to $1k we are good. When block chain technology and advances that is what will push the price up. Us buying right now just makes it harder for real investors to invest low. Be cool and let them eat dick when it hits 1m dollars in 2021 instead of John McAfee. Be cool bro, you are coming off as a crazy person. Trust in Block chain and ignore all the haters. They are not relevant for our future. Let them sell and miss out. We will be rich and they will swallow a bottle of pills when they realise what a mistake they made

@_date: 2018-03-31 03:13:27
China uses slave labor to mine, with most likely government electricity. It doesn't matter what the price is until the block chain technology catches up so even if bitcoin goes go $100 I don't care. It will skyrocket just like the .com boom that nobody understood. Now... now the internet is God. Even the dumbest use it, even children use it. Block chain will be that big.

Yes... but if weak minded people don't sell.. We can't buy low... you see the issue we have here... We aren't bad people.. but I mean those thinking of selling... why not help  them feel better about their choice and let us buy at a better price? Be reasonable friend.
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:02:43
Why freak out? Intelligent and based individuals know the value of bitcoin. Let the weak sell and the strong buy. The weak in 3-5 years will eat their words way before McAfee eats his dick. Think of block chain the way the internet was at 1995. Nobody understood it besides a few nerds and dorks. Now even the stupidest person can use the internet. Block chain is the same way and when the technology catches up to where the mouth breathers can benefit our investment will pay off. That being said if you aren't strong willed enough to stand with us and Hodl for a brighter future without centralized banks and control than please just sell so we can buy bitcoin at a valued price before it skyrockets back up in price 
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:25:42
It has more value than the USD. It at least takes work and money to make plus limited amount of currency. Go away troll

@_date: 2018-03-31 16:54:04
Why we use Apple pay. What is different about using bitcoin with that system? It's more secure. It's more valuable being a limited amount at 21m. It takes work to mine. USD is printed in unlimited numbers like monopoly money. As soon as we can spend bitcoin like an Apple pay app. we all litteraly go to the MOON. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:08:50
I'm not gambling. That is just my idea place to buy more bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:36:19
Yeah I'm not worried about money. I've only invested what I have extra and when my markers come I don't over extend myself so I can be patient. I don't know why people would buy huge bank loans for bitcoin... fucking crazy. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:14:42
You just have to have discipline and not focus on highs and lows. Don't take loans out to buy bitcoin. You have to pay that back. If you believe in block chain than it is no problem waiting for that to come about. If you think bitcoin is a get rich scheme than you are going to hate the ups and downs and that is not what bitcoin is about 
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:38:03

We have already established your intuition being lacking
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:40:55
Wrong. Special forces have tested it and they can't get over. Try again . If special forces can't get over it how do you think a beaner with only a dream to get him over the top will make it 
? It's going to be a beautiful wall :)

Tell me what makes the USD valuable. It's backed by nothing and is minted to unlimited amounts it's monopoly money. Bitcoin takes effort and resources to make with a very limited supply. When all the bitcoins are mined. That is it. That gives bitcoin value. The USD is big bankster monopoly money that just creates debt. USD is centralized and controlled by the corrupt federal reserve. Bitcoin is owned by the people and is protected by the block chain. I am my own bank.

You are a degenerate and it shows in your world view. EU is finished and Bitcoin is going to 1m. If you like better so much John McAfee already has one out there where he will eat his dick. Doesn't get more clear than that. Bitcoin is the future. He bet his dick on it 
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:54:00
I agree all the bitcoiners with no backbone should get out now and let the adults push forward

Maybe casual players need bigger stones. Any one who is doing this for short term gains will be disappointed. Any one hoping to win in this game needs to be focused on the long game.

I truly believing bitcoin will be a big step in making America great again. Give the currency back to the people (US) and kick out the big banksters and the federal reserve.

Are you talking the prototype or our old fencing? And if it's scalable I highly doubt that will be the wall prototype our POTUS will choose

Selfishly I want it to stay low for a bit longer so I can invest big
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:06:30
It's raising too fast , I need more time to invest :(
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:42:46
I believe Segwit jammed things up,  because Mycellium doesn't use Segwit anything sent with Segwit isn't recognized and can't transfer:(

Because we have a new world order,  we have a deep state that hates American freedom.  If you st and up for the people you die. That is why what Trump is doing is crucial,  he can afford his own protection 
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:58:31
It can go to 5k and will still rise again. You don't understand block chain 
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:17:47
�� closest I could find for a Lambo emoji :(
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:04:04
Because typically women rely on men for anything good and life and take it from us later. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 22:16:04
4k is a good buy price 
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:39:06
I'm not gonna trade, I'm waiting until it's the  currency in the world. Just would be nice to buy some bitcoin at value. 20k is not really that much compared to what it will be, but I would still rather invest at 4k than 10k or higher 
@_date: 2018-04-01 01:37:22
Most importantly be confident, be caring and be the type of person worth loving and you will be fine. The rest comes naturally. Be the type of man worth loving and you will do great

@_date: 2018-04-03 17:48:51
It was a huge spike and just got on and haven't done any of my block chain news research so figured I would ask reddit. I mean that's a huge bump!
@_date: 2018-04-29 00:11:26
Why do you care so bad about it hitting 10k when it's going to go to a Million? Wouldn't you rather it stay low for a bit so you can invest more?
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:36:20
Any better options to use Trezor cold wallet with? 
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:04:53
That was an April fools joke lol

I just want to see a better world man. I don't agree on his delete all FUD. I believe in free speech. I want bitcoin to prosper but not at the sacrifice of your free speech. I believe me personally you have the right to say whatever you want. And if my views are correct they can withstand a differing standpoint. I do agree with him that block chain will change the world. But not that mods should delete your comments. If I am correct and I do believe I am, you speaking your view point won't hurt that. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:17:52
I want to buy big at $5k, but it seems to be surging upwards. Not mad, just sad I didn't invest sooner. I make more money in the summer so was hoping to invest big this summer before the price skyrockets:(

Together friend we will build a better America and not let the intolerant screeching left shame or stop US!

The point is to hold until bitcoin kills fiat and it's the main currency and there is no need to transfer.
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:48:42
I think a world without central banks is a good start. Trump thankfully is turning the industry back on! I grew up building docks ,my father had a welding company and I'm in the Army now so I appreciate hard working middle America.  I want a better life for all no matter where they live. Yes I believe in America first but I want to see suffering disappear world wide. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:40:08
Well I would prefer to just get my Lambo... But that is just me ������
@_date: 2018-04-04 04:19:34
You and me both man, this is the time to invest when it's low. Sadly most will only invest when it's 15k plus and what is the point then?

You will still benefit

Anybody can make predictions man, be easy on the guy. And it's just as likely it will be 6k next week as it is that it will be 10k next week. Bitcoin hasn't had a solid pattern of late. All the big investors are kinda just watching right now figuring out what to do. Him, like you,  like all of us Block chain lovers are excited and sometimes a little nervous of what is going on. It's only natural for us to speculate. But in the end it's important regardless of our speculation to trust and have faith in Block chain, because in the end... we all ��MOONIN⛼������

So what do I do about getting my cryptos onto my Trezor hard wallet?
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:54:43
Why would someone want to see someone cause harm to themselves? Even if i lose my ass in bitcoin, i wouldn't want to see someone tortured. I don't get the hate for McAfee for daring to want a better world where we aren't controlled , manipulated and robbed by the central banks.
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:49:29
I looked into that and for some reason it didn't seem to want to load to the mobile. Said I needed bridge software and the bridge software wouldn't load

Then why add segwit, any add the lighting network? If what you say is true why have these things been added to great improvement. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:18:07
Asaaargh but I need it to dip so I can buy more lol. We have plenty of time for it to Moon! Our Lord and Prophet McAfee said 2021 will be the year of the Great MOON!!

Nah I watch alternative media. There will be no impeachments because there was no collusion and most importantly there will be no blue wave we are keeping house and Senate and John Mccain is a registered Republican too, but a swamp creature who sold his country out. I hope since you are here you at least support Bitcoin. I have a feeling you don't though

Anyone using bitcoin to day trade is doing it wrong. Hold for the future.

Hey any one know what to do in mycellium when it's not able to scan mycellium account when you are paired with trezor cold wallet?
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:13:32
I know it's going to moon, so I'm not worried about the price right now. I just want more chances to buy bitcoin at value so if the price is low till the end of summer and THEN skyrockets I'll be happy. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 22:11:33
You aren't banned bud. They played an April fools joke on all of us. We all got the message lol
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:28:59
Okay. Well regardless of our political views hopefully we both make it to the top Bigly! I doubt we will change each other's minds but we do have one thing in common. Wanting a future the federal reserve won't be able to control and manipulate us in. Plus rows of Lambos!! Haha ��
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:13:25
Wouldn't an app be how you would use Trezor wallet on our phones? Lol
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:09:38
You didn't HODL. If you are going to invest, then invest lol. If you think you can day trade bitcoin it's just too hard to predict right now. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:10:59
But what about the 2021 model of Lambos the year our prophet McAffe proclaims our victory
