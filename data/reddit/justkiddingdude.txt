You got anything to back that claim up? Cause it just looks a lot like banks are not earning enough on poor people, so they make them pay for their service. If it had to do with cost that banks were incurring because of regulations, you would see a fee from all customers, not just poor people. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 07:32:16
I'm sure that's partially the reason. The other one being that a lot of new people got burnt by the last dip, panic-sodl and have pulled out of crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:07:12
Or... Because they believe that we need a monetary system that doesn't involve a central issuer of the money? Because they believe that such a tremendous power of issuing money should be decentralized?

Really? I have only heard 1 person talk about bitcoin for the past weeks (used to be a daily conversation). But maybe that's just my surroundings.

I use a paper wallet to store my coins. I also use an offline laptop to sign transactions to use the funds on my paper wallet. Works perfect for me. I've built my own application to do the signing, though.

You would rather resort to a hard fork than have services fix their shit first? That seems like the wrong order of things imo. 
I think it’s a good thing that the community has voted against a block size increase. We need to explore other solutions fully before we turn to such drastic measures. Are people still butthurt about this? I thought big blockers finally got their big block coin.

This is actually the worst explanation you can give to beginners. Storing private keys on a usb? Fo' real????
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:44:17
Create keys on a computer/laptop that has never been online, write them on a piece of paper. Or use a hardware wallet.

Hi, can you give a bit more information on how this address was generated? Does the seed phrase lead to a deterministic wallet? If so, what is the path to the communicated BTC address.

This debate isn't about price. It's about increasing capacity *immediately* so that bitcoin can be faster with less transaction cost.  Bitcoin has lost a huge chunk of market share in the crypto space since the moment it started to have capacity issues. SegWit doesn't solve this issue immediately. If you think that, you've been lied to. Segwit is a more mid- to long-term solution. We need to increase capacity immediately to save BitCoin. But since the bigblockers have been ridiculed for their ideas to genuinely fix the problems immediately and had their opinions censored on this sub, they decided to take matters into their own hands and fork off, because they feel that this is not the BTC they signed up for: a peer-to-peer, cheap, fast, censorship resistant digital cash system.

I don't think you know how Lightning Network works. Please watch this video from Andreas Antonopoulos: 
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:19:38
Gee, if only there was a way to increase capacity of the network so that the fees would drop and transaction speed would rise...
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:43:45
Exactly, OP thinks everybody should have listened to him because he was right looking back. That is called hindsight bias. Truth is, they (his family) can't know that Bitcoin would reach this current price with the information they had at the time and shouldn't have acted on it. There has never been anything like Bitcoin in the history of mankind, no one can surely say where the f*ck this will go.

If you think $2 is low, you don't understand where this technology *should* be going. This was meant as cash. This was meant to buy a cup of coffee with. I don't want to pay 50% transaction fee everytime i buy a cup of coffee. I have family in poor parts of the world. I used to be able to send my cousin a small amount of bitcoin so that he could buy sigarettes. Now I have to send double for him to get enough money for that same pack of sigarettes due to transaction fees. $2 is a fuckton of money for some people in the world. THAT is what bitcoin is about. $2 may not be a lot for people who trade with 1000s of dollars, but this wasn't meant for trading. It was meant to pay stuff with. It was meant to provide banking for the poorest people in the world. And if you think it's about fucking with the price, my friend, I can tell you: You don't know anyting about this technology or the debate that has been going on for God knows how long.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:53:09
Gonna get flack for saying this: But just because they are supporters of BCH, doesn't mean they should put all their eggs in 1 basket and only mine BCH. It's actually quite sensible to use some (if not the majority) for the main chain that has proven economic worth.
It's like saying: You support ETH? Then why don't you use all your hashing power to mine ETH?
But maybe I'm being too logical.

You didn't know that smallblocks and a growing mempool cause higher fees?

Funny how Satoshi used that quote in a discussion where Satoshi was defending big blocks :\^)
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:44:16
A1: You can buy off coinbase. Despite it's high fees, it's actually very easy and user-friendly. Don't forget to send your Bitcoin to a personally owned address.
A2: No one can actually give you a prediction about this. Asking about it is just asking for trouble. History shows that all of them are really bullish. BTC has given the most returns in the past few months, ETH has given the most returns from the start of the year. Read up on the top 10 cryptocurrencies (yes, including Bitcoin Cash). Talk to different people and different subreddits about these coins and decide for yourself what you think gives the most value. Other than that, don't trust anyone who's says they can predict the market, even if they have a good track record (hindsight bias).
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:49:35
Not sure why this is being downvoted. It's idiotic to believe that these things are not connected and will not affect each other.

Yes, I am. Difference is that usually I choose to not have a discussion at parties, but enjoy the music and dance. It's like saying to a drill worker 'You must be fun in bed'. One act has nothing to do with the behaviour that the individual exhibits at another moment in time.

1. Who is 'we all'? Don't speak for others, only for yourself.
2. What is 'most probably'? Is it the range between 80%-90%? or anything above 60%? This is EXACTLY why we have statistics, so that we can quantify uncertainty without using vague words like 'very likely' or 'most probably'. Also, if you choose to use statistical averages, don't forget to mention standard deviations.
3. I take the use of language very seriously. Most conflicts/arguments are caused by the improper use of language, which causes individuals to misunderstand each other. If I have to correct people on their misuse of language, causing them to be angry with me or have others sigh at me, claiming that 'we all' know what the person 'meant', I'll gladly accept that, if it means that people will be more precise with their use of language.
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:27:21
It's about using statistics to back up your opinion. If he said 'I think/believe Nick is Satoshi', I wouldn't even have bothered to comment. It's his opinion and he's allowed to have one. My 'beef' is with the 90%, which implies that he has some quantitative grounds for his statement, which we know he hasn't.
@_date: 2017-09-21 08:01:31
That's a correlation, not causation. Other crypto's also pumped high, but they don't have full blocks.
The argument of big blockers is that they want bitcoin to be peer-to-peer cash, as it was originally intended. Full blocks cause high fees, which obstructs bitcoin from being a good medium of exchange. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 08:14:03
Some people from the medieval times would say that our current society (at least the western ones) is a kind of a utopia.
@_date: 2017-09-21 08:10:55
Does that matter? If the Chinese government shuts down those miners, the difficulty adjusts and it will be mined by people outside of China. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:22:36
While I think it's likely that Nick is Satoshi, please refrain from using statistical numbers without actual data. At best, it just looks ignorant, at worst, it's intellectually dishonest. What do you base the 90% on? Your feelings? 
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:45:40
Sounds like the "Many people are saying..." of a certain presidential candidate.
@_date: 2017-09-22 06:14:09
Not sure what that has to do with the argument. It was about whether a government shutting down mining farms would kill bitcoin. The answer is no.

It's fine. Let them experiment with their intranet. It will make them familiar with the jargon and technology. Then they will choose the crypto that is open and decentralized, because it's actually more secure and allows a lot more innovation than this national coin.

Please explain how bigger blocks cause miners to be paid more if the fees are much lower (because blocks are not full)?

@_date: 2017-09-21 08:07:32
Nope, most of the enthusiasm for BCH is that a lot of people want Bitcoin to be a good medium of exchange, which means low fees. The fastest and easiest way to do that, is increasing block-size limit. Most of the people that support BCH just stopped having faith in Core and Blockstream, because we've been having this scaling problem for so long and they refused to even consider the easy and immediate solution of raising the block size limit.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:19:05
True, but going from P2SH segwit address to bech32 segwit address is very easy. I understand that they wouldn't use bech32 yet, because a lot of wallets can only send to addresses that start with a 1 or 3.

Sure, it might be a mistake. But I'm a mathematician, and with everyone throwing around statistical terminology around, I find it to be my obligation to remind people that things like 90% means '9 out of 10 events', mistake or not.

I understand the off-chain argument, and I'm even pro-L2 solutions, but it won't be done within a year. It baffles me why people don't want to increase blocksize until that time (which is an easy and immediate scaling-solution), so that we can continue adoption of bitcoin. Isn't that the ultimate goal?

My dear, dear friend. I'm an assistant professor in Political Economics. I know very well what socialism and communism is. Sadly, it's you who hasn't studied enough to understand what they are. You are making a couple of common, but horribly wrong assumptions.
1. Socialism and communism are 2 entirely different beasts, putting them together shows how little you know about these topics
2. They are not 'basically collectivism'. To think that they can both (see point 1) be summed up like that shows once again that you know absolutely nothing about these complex social economic systems. 
3. Bitcoin doesn't 'represent' an individual opting out from a state sponsored status quo. That is a side effect that you can choose to have, but is not necessary. It represents an open, borderless, transparent, censorship resistant, decentralized system. If you don't know the difference, you're not only ignorant about social economic systems, but also about Bitcoin.
4. Bitcoin is not the enemy of the state.Im not sure what kind of Banana republic you live in, but our government is actually investing in blockchain research to find out what the most secure and accessible ways are of using this technology, so that people can use it to better their lives.
So basically everything you say is false and you should really educate yourself before you tell others to study. LOL!
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:27:14

Good for you man. But tell me how running a small engineering business makes you any knowledgable about socialism and communism? Because THAT is what the discussion was about, right? Not how much quid you or I have made, not how much respect you have for me, but 2 social economic systems. Must be hard for you to attack your opponent's arguments, rather than their person, isn't it? Please learn what a proper argument is before you start a discussion, you pleb.
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:49:04
Sure, libertarians think it's the purest expression of free markets.
Conservatives think it's the best representation of what used to be a gold payment system.
Socialists think it's a fantastic way to get rid of all the middle man profits (banks, insurers etc.) that's been keeping a lot of the poor down.
Can we please stop trying to claim something as wonderful as bitcoin for a certain political side? Bitcoin is good for everyone.
