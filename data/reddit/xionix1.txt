Yeah I actually just tried to buy on coinbase and the transaction was declined as it attempted to go through as a Cash Advance and as a fellow churner the first thing I do on a new credit card is set the cash advance limit to $0 lol. Also a chase card, usually I use my citi double cash. Hopefully that still classifies as Purchase.

I think it depends on the card, my Freedom / Freedom Unlimited &amp; Sapphire Preferred all have a $20 limit but my AARP card is $100.
Some banks like AmEx will let you set $0. Either way if you set $100 limit and tried to buy more than $100 on coinbase then the transaction would be declined and you would be protected from cash advance fees so it's still worth setting that.

Those butthurt bag holders deserve to be bag holders. You have to be an idiot to follow a stupid fork with the team of a fake satoshi, felon politician scumbag and a chinese asic monopoly co-founder.

Block size should be raised to 2mb right now. This would not cause any problems and would provide ample time for LN to be finished. Big exchanges should also have implemented SegWit by now. Pretty ridiculous that they have not.

Right now, I just bought some at $3850.

From the casefiles podcast on silk road supposedly Ross did sign up with his original name email but changed it to frosty before he ever posted anything which is the email authorities were given by the admins when they inquired for his sign up info. It wasn't until later on that they somehow discovered he had signed up with his real email before he changed it.

15% is far from "ridiculously low"

Ver is an actual scumbag. Not sure why he has a fanbase. He consistently pulls shady shit and causes people to lose their money yet sheeple still follow him and worship him with stupid shit like "bitcoin jesus". Feel bad for the sheeple who bought into Bitmain Crash based on his shameless promotion while talking shit about real bitcoin, and those who were complacent leaving coins on Mt Gox because of [this](

You've never had more than 2k in your bank account and you're not ok holding long term? Crypto volatility goes both ways. Stick half in a high interest savings account or roth IRA at least and keep the rest as an emergency fund.
