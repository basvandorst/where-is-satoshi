There is also an Australian version to this:

It is safe to say you never held them, they were under Mt Gox at the time and since they is now bankrupt you'd more than likely get nilch back and you'd need to start the process all over again my friend.

Can't do that in Australia I do not think. I'd have to check ;)

Essentially all they'd get is an account number, not much you can do unless you can pass identification questions - however, I see your point.

So you downvoted me because of my comment, anyways - I never had too many issues with iGot, sure a few small things but never anything too signficant, what do you really expect your BANK is pretty lame to when you think about it I have had more issues with AMEX than any other company and when you compare that to iGot it's pretty damn miniscule.

There is simply not enough knowledge around it - there are lot os geeks here online but where it comes to reality it's not as prominent or discussed. If there was better advertising and acknowledgement of the ecosystem then you'd see more of a rise in the occurrence and understand to what Bitcoins is and what it does.

Sadly there is the decline back down to $243 and going down, perhaps a normal routine of the pump and dump, I will remain optimistic about future growth.

So technically the OP is a thief, interesting.
@_date: 2015-05-09 23:07:33
Err, it is more so the fact you removed what was not yours in the first instance. You now are holding it like a ransom until someone can confirm that they own it - your playing like good cop when you're a bad cop and if no one comes to claim it you'll simply keep it for yourself, so to me that is stealing. Sorry.
@_date: 2015-05-05 11:41:33
I'd prefer BitReserve in this case.
@_date: 2015-05-09 23:39:07
EOD you stole Bitcoin - that is how any other person is going to see it. There was never any permission, you said so yourself since the wallet addresses from OP's was not the same. You are aware people like myself actually "PAY" to own a share of "Bitcoin", in Australia it's deemed as a commodity. I don't agree with your ruling by no means, you've taken something that never belonged to you and will keep it because someone has to now confirm they control that wallet - yet, you make it hard because the only way they can reach you is via Reddit - classic.
@_date: 2015-05-03 11:55:13
Their is a higher rate of downtrend than an uptrend. However, I feel that because Bitcoin was blocked in China and to where the Asian markets were big adopters of the Bitcoin - it has shown where Bitcoin would've been if China/Asia had not adopted this currency. I assume at best that if China and the Asian markets hadn't involved themselves by chance then we'd never of reached $1100 on the US exchanges and we'd still be at this point today hoping and cringing for a better outcome, if $240 wasn't a really good outcome for Bitcoin already.
@_date: 2015-05-09 06:17:02

Reminds me not to use Cloudbet in the future, thank god this post was made.
@_date: 2016-06-22 21:41:16
That doesn't work for me that link, it is in NL also. I base mine off AUD but I can re-convert to AUD if required, since BTC is going down right now I want to see how much my BTC will be worth at that point so I know where I stand in terms of value. AUD value was at around $1050 recently, now down to $870 or so - just wanting to see how much the value of my coins will be at each price point.
I will try and work around that link and see if that Google one works for me.
Example:  shows you what the BTC value is worth now, I need to find out what it will be worth should I have 10btc at say $1050 and then 10btc worth at $500 etc.

I would not mind buying with a Credit Card, right now I use Coinjar and they support Poli which supports instant deposits to $1,000.00 AUD and I also use Independent Reserve for the larger deposits up to $4,000.00 AUD. I'd love to integrate all in to one facility, Coinbase seems to be idolised and yet all it says is "Coming Soon" which has been that way for the past year if not longer. USD to AUD conversion is shocking at the moment and definitely not feasible, they need to consider AUD as an option also.
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:24:48
Why is it that LROS charges you 3.19453 to send $15,000.00 at today's rates, versus Coinjar for example which gives you a sell off of $15,000.00 for 3.0240 (btc) how do you justify the $972.00 or so markup on your costs vs Coinjar? 
Mind you that excludes the $150 that Coinjar would charge at 1% so still you pay $822 more than what you would over the LROS prices.
I am not sure how you can claim no fees or charges but your rates are way higher, sure you need to make money as a business but you're literally more so ripping customers off.
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:23:47
I have 8 bitcoins worth of BCC and 13 bitcoins of BTC - for now, I am holding BCC for the potential growth, I am lost by the whole BCC and the BCH but in any respect I am holding.
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:04:35
I don't know if it is BCH as someone else said BCC is not BCH and others are saying it is, I mean I am confused on what is what.
@_date: 2016-11-14 02:19:10
Just realised they do have $10k limit on my account, however, the instant approval is for the $2.5k - I am wondering if they mean by their identification part they increase that $2.5k to $10k, though I don't think that is how it works, seems I have BPAY for the $10k also - this could be the better option :)

@_date: 2016-11-13 22:24:00
Signed up with them ages ago, never used them, more so because of this "This option is available after a successful cash purchase." - So I have to waddle all the way to the bank, make a deposit, then get it all validated before I can use Poli. Anyways, are you saying this because your name is CoinTree and you work for CoinTree? 
It is like recommending yourself as a business because you own it, I hate when people talk themselves up, sort of a deterrent just like the first deposit.
@_date: 2016-12-02 20:58:45
Seems like it has gone through now, I did it around 7pm MLB time and it did not go through to Coinbase until this morning, that was more than 10hrs waiting for coins to be sent out, obviously something unusual here - it was done which I am happy about but I'm currently questionable if I should rely on them going forwards.
@_date: 2015-08-24 10:39:23
Circle closed my account, provided my passport, drivers license, etc and they closed it without notice - after I contacted them, they simply said we cannot open your account, reset password, your account is closed and we cannot go in to detail why.
If it is my account I want to know why otherwise they are just another louzy bank that is closing accounts.
@_date: 2015-08-10 01:30:23
I hedge mine against the AUD, or my own currency. So if the price is fluctuating downward then I'd hedge it, then unhedge it when it is back on the reversal, tricky game of cat and mouse though. End of the day, don't carry all your eggs in one basket.
@_date: 2015-08-30 07:40:55
Only thing that worries me is he works for Coinjar, that is my primary concern. I am wondering when they'll get rid of him.
@_date: 2015-08-28 21:54:53
I'm not fake you idiot, I've used iGot, they were slow but good so before you start criticising us other make sure you have facts around what you say, so in saying that, show me my account and show me how fake it is?
@_date: 2015-08-23 01:36:03
I'd be interested also, I harvest just under 20 BTC, would hate that to somewhat disappear.
@_date: 2015-08-26 10:48:48
Well, I don't use the other services. You can use those as well, I just use what I know of - Coinjar simply works for my needs, you could possibly use Bitreserve as alternative, the choice is really up to you and I suppose it comes down to what currency you rely on, at least with Bitreserve you can hedge your coins against dollars and gold/silver etc.
@_date: 2015-08-26 10:50:32
Plus for me I hedge my coins on the AUD, which many other companies don't support, bitreserve doesn't at this stage.

I hedged my 16.3xxx bitcoin about 2 weeks ago, I've gained now 20.258xx bitcoin, I've gained some bitcoin from the downfall, now it is the question, when to buy back in?
That is the question that is one of the hardest to answer.
@_date: 2015-08-26 09:10:22
Coinjar.com, they used to be Australian based, now they are UK based. I simply move my Bitcoin to hedge it against the AUD which does incur a conversion fee, but depending on the direction of the value of bitcoin you could profit, or lose out - I hedged my Bitcoin at around $270 or so and it dropped to $222 at the moment, so my Bitcoin at the time was around 16.1 BTC which increased to as of current 19.09BTC.

Depends on the exchange also, there are several exchanges and different rates such as OKCoin which shows $300 already, bitfinex at $296 and Bitstamp at $295 - I follow Bitstamp since it has records back to 2013.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:36:48
Simply bad decision making, not allowing time on my trades, as soon as seeing a drop selling to later see it rise 10 fold. Common mistakes or not paying attention and being irrational. Mind you none of these were ever emotional trades just bad judgment calls.

No I'm not thank you, but thanks for your comment it's always appreciated. My delivery was fine, it's the people who've never used iGot that don't understand (like yourself), I have called them out myself so don't think I've not done on reddit, I've had many issues with the company yet I don't go around calling them a scam just because they are incompetent and slow - it's people who call them a scam without knowing the true history that worries me, I can only hope people do the same to you so you'll understand this.

It's not what you invest it's how you invest. Time is money but money is time and it's how you look at it to what you'll take away from it. Look $3000 isn't anything, there are tonnes of people investing millions in to Bitcoin for the riches but my aim is completely different - play small it gives you direction and insight and if trading is what you're wanting to do GO FOR IT :D

I've been watching Bitcoin for the last 2 years, you'd be surprised that I watch it daily, I cannot go a day without actually not seeing the charting of the Bitcoin value and it's influences. I was invested in to the STR and their Foundation - sadly due to circumstances I decided to withdraw my funds from Polionex and move it back to Bitcoin, I even hitched a ride on the Litecoin venture myself just days ago and got about an extra 0.3 BTC from the growth before the collapse so I technically lost nothing, something gained at least.

I have a Neteller account, and I have had some bad experiences with them but then some positive ones also. I don't use them at the moment but they're pretty decent for a financial institution but I surely wouldn't use them over my normal bank here.
@_date: 2015-07-18 10:52:15
@_date: 2015-07-11 14:00:30
Honestly I've seen worse :) you've got to look at who's selling at a good rate on the method of payment you want to use. Most sellers will mark up by 10% but then there is greed that kicks in and you'll seen up to 20% if not more and you can't reverse after you've paid as you've agreed to what he/she is providing - look at their other exchanges and values, look and see if they've also other sales with the same payment method and see what the markups are etc as some create more than one sale thread and sell at different rates for each for no valid reason on the markups. 
Look if you're paying $316 as opposed to $292 for 1BTC it's not bad but you could find other exchanges that may offer something less or similar it really depends, again exchanges will charge there own fees and percentages so always look at how much BTC you'll get in return for the value you want to buy, obviously the closer to the value of 1BTC the better it's going to be.
@_date: 2015-07-11 14:04:17
More like an hour ago... It was at $300 exact an hour ago! 
@_date: 2015-07-11 09:41:18
Be cautious with LBC as well, make sure you are not getting ripped off - I've noticed that a lot with LBC - not sure if it has changed but different sellers have different rates % wise and some markup quite a bit and you get less in return. Always research around where you are buying from, who you are buying from etc.
@_date: 2015-07-12 13:25:33
Perfectly being honest here I don't foresee $10k in value anytime soon. It would take years and based on bitcoins growth patterns and concerns over it's use and legitimacy it will take years to reach such values, if it ever eventuates that far - it's a bit bullish to predict high forecasts and expectations at this point in bitcoins infancy.
@_date: 2015-07-28 08:27:54
For a few mesley cents, no way.
@_date: 2015-07-11 11:00:07
I have been with Coinjar since the early days, I don't think they ever had the miner fee option, not that I can ever remember. They've simplified everything in to one platform now which is good - however, maybe over simplified.

Good news doesn't cut it anymore, Bitcoin I will always love due to it's ingenuity. I've invested in to buying Bitcoin at it's high prices above $600 AUD and also at it's price points lower than $200 prior to it's $1,000 success.
Bitcoin has a long way to go, it's growing and maturing as it should though people need to expect the values of the currency or commodity (however one perceives it to be) to grow and decline, it's like growing pains really.
I do foresee the value of Bitcoin dwindling further below the $200 mark, most definitely - though give it sometime and it should start back on a slow upwards trend back in to more positive territory.

The advertisement runs via a bit.ly hidden URL, the page then lands here: 
It's clearly a scam, chose to login with fake credentials and it took me to the real page.
Please don't click even Google ads if they look suspicious, this one has a 0 where the "o" is supposed to be, always be vigilant on what you click and don't assume all Google Ads are legitimate.

There is an app on iOS that I love, It's "Tinyscan", takes away background nonsense and has the receipt readable to them. However, it does compress it as well - not sure if it's handy as they may see it as tampered with. Etc Etc. It's a good solution none the less.

Agreed, I have managed to add my Australian ones but I can't verify any others for some reason not even American Express. I'm not human verified but BTCJAM has my accounts linked with the bank but it says I'm not verified by these which is odd - try and add credit card and all it ever does it load endlessly even when it states 30 seconds!!

See the thing is if I was to promote a service like Coinjar people hate on me because it is an online wallet, not associated with them at all - just love their service. Yet, if I was to also self promote my service people would down vote me and I'd more than likely get reported and shadow banned. The day that someone does a lot of self advertisement and everyone praises them and the day they decide to close unexpected then people won't say anything. It's ironic, but keep down voting me I don't care.

With a D+ rating, no thank you. I've invested in to many BTCJAM users, guess what 2 of them went in to arbitration and the users simply run off with the funds - since most people only really invest in small amounts no one is willing to take the matter to court after arbitration. Regardless, we never get our money back and the person who attained the funding is the one who seems to win in the end -- sorry to be the debbie downer of this topic, though as an investor in to other people I have simply run in to more negatives than positives at BTCJAM.

Depending on the exchanges you go to of course, some are quite excessive as well. Though, in saying that I BPAY in to my Coinjar since they don't allow Credit Card for Australian users, only it's UK customers in BETA trial I believe. Not sure on their exact rates, though it would be interesting to see what they've to offer in that regards.
As an individual buyer, if anyone has any other options to purchase with that will give the the same gains but cheaper, I am all ears :)
Their is always that possibility that the purchase you buy could double as the Bitcoin value climbs, it could hit the reverse trend at any stage as well, though who can predict where the value could go.
Might hit them on their Facebook page and get some more answers, could be interesting... Though, I agree they are shooting themselves in the foot for the extra added costs with Credit purchases since the value they are selling at is much higher also.
@_date: 2015-09-23 10:55:54
I've been using them for quite a while, they're pretty legitimate, even though Zhou is on the back of my mind daily, they aren't ones to ignore to be honest. I respect that OutCast3k has his opinion, but he's never used them by the sounds of it.

I upvoted for the sakes of upvoting.
@_date: 2015-09-24 07:52:22
When you consider it, the debit card costs you $6 to withdraw at an ATM, or you could do the wire which is going to cost you $30 anyways, so I'd prefer a direct xfer from a bitcoin provider to my own bank and I simply lose 2% of what I withdraw from.
Example. Deposit $6k in to Neteller you lose 1% of the value, then xfer that to your bank there goes another $30 or so - $90 total.
Depending on your Bitcoin provider/exchange, I would lose 2% on $6k so that is $120 straight up, which is $30 difference to what it would cost me by transferring it to Neteller.
Higher balances I'd think be btter for use with Neteller over something miniscule.

Exactly, look at the last drop - from $334 to $305 USD on Bitstamp. It has gone back from that $305 to $420 and now back to $375 back to $396 - it will rebound back to $400 - just needs to make some clear way from all the trash orders.

Based on recent trends, it's different from the past. Don't always rely on past events. It could be a new day, new order, new successes. However, it is a little too volatile atm to really be sure what will happen. I'd say it will rebound.

I've used iGot, always got my funds and bitcoins through them. They are some what legitimate though very slow. Coinjar, nice staff, just higher exchange rate which is a kick in the pants - they support Credit Card payments for UK customers only though do PoliPayments for Australia alongside BPAY. And Independent Reserve, signed up and recently activated my service, yet to buy through them.
I'd say via IR and sell via CJ - you seem to get a better outcome that way :)

... I agree with his opening statement. I was down voted because I stated that Bitcoin needs a better structure with how it works. I love  don't get me mistaken, however, there does need to be some convenience for users/consumers otherwise I don't see it being able to go mainstream for the masses. Everyone always has their own opinion and that is a right given to us, though when you think about it - how is the masses to adopt this type of technology if they have to have paper wallets or offline wallets with encryption keys to prevent people from stealing their coins. 
No one likes a Government run system but inherently it's the most likely safest option available. I believe Bitcoin is a revolutionary piece of technology but it does need some sort of protection so that it can be adopted and for people to take interest in it and also know that their coins/money will be safe rather than having the risk of it being stolen from right underneath them.

... It says all serviced countries other than the United States, yet they've added USD in there. However, I feel Neteller is quite stupid, I was told I can't use Neteller MasterCard in the USA when I was visiting there last year for 3 months - yet I was able to use the card each time at a Citibank, Wells Fargo, and BoFA ATM's. Mind you they did charge me on top so like $12.00 per withdrawal since you're already charged $6.00 by Neteller.
Neteller ended up suspending my card several times and all I had to do was use a proxy to show I was in Australia again to have my account restored, I wonder if Neteller ever looked at my transactions with my debit card, well if they did they'd see I was truly withdrawing from the USA!
Anyways I feel they either don't like the US or have some tough restrictions over there.

@_date: 2015-03-30 09:47:24
Scratch that, there seems to be an issue with their site. Normally you buy bitcoins and it asks you to confirm the order when you click "BUY BITCOINS", I simply tested $100 by hitting enter and it bought the BTC straight away and now it is converted to BTC - however, I didn't physically want to buy them at the moment. GRRR @  ... Wish they'd fix their damn website.
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:03:14
On a realistic level I would say we won't be hitting $1000 per Bitcoin until 2020 at the current rate Bitcoin is going, not to dampen spirits, though with all the bad publicity and the lack of control to security (ie; hacking still occurring with advanced security) then I can't see it this prediction happening.
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:59:14
Love the idea, however, conversions from this service in EUR to potential future AUD would be around 2.5% and that could be significant maybe.
I could simply request bank withdraw to my account at a 1% loss, or use my Swipe Card and withdraw $500 a day free - that's annoying however ...

Correct, Bitcoins cannot be reversed. Only way they can be reversed back to you is only if the person they were sent to send them back. It's nothing like your traditional banking system where banks can simply reverse funds sent.
@_date: 2015-03-28 02:49:53
I work in the Collections side of banking and finance, maybe not the nicest side to work on - however, banks make their money back on insurances when lending the debt out so inadvertently they'd make money back with insurance and then selling the debt off for whatever cents they do in the dollar for the amount. Banks make enough money as it is and in a lot of cases where a bank reduces fees or percentages they attach those cuts to other products/services so in the end there is no winner to the consumer if they take up those product/services. I agree with your statement of course, there is always risk, risk the bank has to take, I've dealt with a lot of customers that have defaulted on their loans and you'd be surprised at how many never pay them back.

I've invested more in to Bitcoin over the last few years than I have in my own bank account! I love Bitcoin, it's surely a revolutionary to the culture of standard banking that we all have known to adopt in to our current lives.

This subreddit is more based around bitcoins news, bitcoin price is not news, anything related to price belongs in the Bitcoinmarkets - you are talking about a price as in currency which belongs there since you are using figures. Honestly, this isn't news to anyone.

I'll admit their support team sucks, hassle them. I sent $500 to them a few months ago as well, I sent it to an account they claimed was "closed" and they told me wait a few days it'll be deposited back to your bank account .... Days passed and I contacted them again and how funny it be they deposit the money that same day I contacted them so someone told me some BS about the account being closed, other than that I've had smooth sailing with them.

There forum is online? I can access that no problems, I was just curious about it since they decided to get crowdfunding for their alt-coin, I just don't see how they are amazing as they claim to be and not sure if I should consider investing.
Coinmarketcap posts them at 15, not quite within the top 10 but for a new alt-coin they've had some limited success, but I will also try and reach out to them, maybe link them to Reddit also ;)
@_date: 2015-03-27 00:02:34
Maybe read this thread first :) 
I don't want to seem like I recommend them or favourite Coinjar all the time, however, I am pretty proactive with using them for my bitcoin needs.
Coinjar's support is far superior to iGot - however, they don't have the option of bank transfer, they used to but not anymore unfortunately. So essentially you are stuck with the BPAY alternative and they claim it takes 2-3 days but I've always had mine deposited the next day as long as it was done before 4PM the prior day.
They charge 1% FEE for buy-in and 2% for the sell off, you can either convert the BTC to the card and withdraw it, or you can withdraw to your bank account, whatever suits your wants and needs.
Look, I've never had any issues with them, yes one of the co-Founders has been known to be in foul play but as far as I am aware he's not a major owner to Coinjar so this is a good thing, whether or not people choose to use the service it's entirely up to them and I won't force people to use them, they act like a normal bank in some ways but at least you can hold BTC with them and also move those funds to hedged accounts in different currencies.
I only use iGot for the convenience of bank transfers with the Commonwealth Bank, that is about all :)
@_date: 2015-03-26 12:51:46
Circle is odd with cards, I am in Australia and have a Neteller debit mastercard, I created an account one time and it accepted it, after a week or so Circle closed my account so I created a new one and used the same card and it failed as apparently the billing address information was incorrect - nothing had changed. So I think it has it's moments, just luck of the draw it seems for us outsiders.

@_date: 2015-11-13 22:16:34
Agreed. The way it works out can be very legit. If you attain one persons bank account, say via local bitcoins, and then sell your own Bitcoin - then give the person buying them the other persons account details and then have them deposit that in to the ther persons account, it could definitely work out - shady yes, and completely workable ... Not sure why Judge Judy shrugged this off as it could of been perfectly legit, more so id say the drugs and trafficking marijuana didn't work in his case.

I'm pretty sure you have to deposit from your own account and not someone else's, pretty sure it states that somewhere to be honest. I deposited $2400 not long ago and had no issues, my dilemma with them is that I lose $50 on it since they claim 0% buy in yet you lose at a percentage somewhere along the line, it's about 1% or close about.
@_date: 2015-03-27 04:10:16
I'd say an offline encrypted wallet in the case of 53 BTC - but be sure to save your encryption files and information. Cold storage wallets are relatively simple to use and no tutorial is really needed, though I'd consider cold storage for such a large amount since third-party attacks against Blockchain have been known and most others here would also recommend cold storage as opposed to an online wallet where risks are an abundance.

Never had the problem you're having, yet you set to lose on the deposit because you sound like you'll transfer to another exchange and possibly lose the value of what you bought in at - if it ever gets deposited.

What can I do about this now, I mean, I have bought bitcoins that I didn't really want to buy - not at the rate, there is a confirmation window that appears when you click buy bitcoins and now I have bought at a rate I never wanted to purchase at because there was no confirmation window to say YES I want to buy or NO I do not want to buy.

I'm not 100% confident in them, though, I've not had any real issues with them. Paid them $4000 via Commonwealth Bank, got deposited within an hour so I could buy my Bitcoin. It took just under a day to withdraw it as of today so it's not as bad for me but others may see it differently based in their experiences. On my own experience id rate them a 7 of 10.

WOW 8hrs, time seems to be killing you... I've used Coinjar many times, I have 16btc sitting there right now and have not had any issues with them - it is most likely pending for a reason, ever consider that? And why not contact them and ask rather than complaining about it?
@_date: 2015-03-26 04:30:59
I'll rephrase, I live in Melbourne and I am a strong believer in Bitcoin, I'm all about Bitcoin and the potential it has. I've never really liked the traditional banking methods and how banks use their force over us especially in fees that are above board and charging for services that are not acceptable to any level. Rates and percentages are high as hell in Australia and I feel some form of Bitcoin advertising can help even if it's attached to one $20 bank note like this one, gives the banks something to fear and to show them there is other markets out there that are willing to tackle there endless grip on humanity and it's money!

I'm based on AUD so in no way does it help me. I'd have to go back and look at what was the issues so I get it right but their service sucked that was for sure and I can't see why people would still be using them. I couldn't activate my card and it took them 5 days to even reply to one of my tickets so it technically wasn't going to help me. I am with Coinjar who's on AUD for me and it works fine and they've more options now to where Xapo doesn't even with all that funding they got.

I bought around $4000 in Bitcoin from igot, I have used them for a long time and use bank to bank transfers with the CBA - usually my funds are available up to 3 hours after deposit and then I buy bitcoin and move it to my wallet. Personally, I don't feel like igot is a scam, though they are very bad at their job. I had to harrass them in better terms to get my bitcoins withdrawn via ticket and twitter and managed to get that done over 24 hours, not like some here sadly that have taken months to process theirs. They really need to improve their business practises if they are going to survive in this market.
@_date: 2015-03-25 13:21:43

Only way I know is to try and restore the data back with a restore program - then hope the wallet.dat is the same from the previous format, don't re-create the file, or install the program, I did this and it created a new .dat file and it was impossible to recover the old one.
@_date: 2015-03-26 02:00:37
Can't say I ever said that but it's good to know you assumed it. Because that way it makes you look like the idiot, I don't oppose wallets but I am heading down that experience path that I've personally had and find it way too easy in the same sense to lose coins by losing encryption codes - already done it once and Bitcoin definitely won't go mainstream if everyone had to do it this way.
@_date: 2015-03-25 08:27:25
I actually had my own wallet and lost all my bitcoins because I had lost my .dat file when I was infected by a virus and had to format it - obviously my own mistake because I never backed up my .dat file though like anything I still consider  to be far superior to any bank that I've physically banked with and personally without using them how can you know if they are restricting payments to certain places or people - they aren't Coinbase.
I am finding that the USA is very restrictive as opposed to many other places on Earth and I feel that they are the main cause to a lot of problems, and since your recommending your own wallet in your response I'll be sure not to use it.
P.S I don't like being spammed by people.
@_date: 2015-10-17 23:00:40
I was looking at their rates from within transfers, from AUD to BTC it was $368 per 1btc, where at Coinjar it is $380 per 1btc. I wonder what kind of exchange they are using there - would it even be feasible for me to use the service with the fluctuation on costing, even iGot had a better return. Unless I am looking at it, maybe it is better - never count on my mathematics it sucks.

I'll admit it doesn't seem to be as fast as Vuze for me - I use proxy IP and authentication with mine, and for some reason it doesn't work on uTorrent though it does on Vuze. Works fine on QB, though the speeds are varied and not as fast - max I am getting is around 600KiB/s yet I get up to 900KiB/s + on Vuze. Not worried so much about it though as it does work and seems cleaner than Vuze.

I saw Rimbit on the Indiegogo site and was curious about it. What makes it better than Bitcoin? and how is Rimbit supposedly revolutionary?
* Seems you can buy Rimbit with Bitcoin as per their shop on their forum, is it even worth it?
Then I read this article where the owner claims it isn't a scam even though it's pre-mined?

Hear you, I sold at $230 and it pumped to $260, FML right.

I've never had issues with them. I love the Coinjar wallet even though it's an online wallet, I was ridiculed by many for not using an encrypted offline wallet, but I have my reasons not to - it's a decent service you really can't go wrong with it.

There is no way I'd put 100% in to Bitcoin. I noticed that when the value of bitcoin drops like $20 I lose around $60 in total. The value change is a lot especially in AUD - not sure on the USD side of things?

Doubt it, was never planning on signing up with them. So I don't see how I'll be a victim, therefore your comment is invalid. Besides that, you can't assume a service is a scam unless you've physically been scammed by them or have anecdotal proof to backup what you are saying.
Right now all you have as part of their proclaimed scam is a % and a regulated wallet and nothing more - this definitely DOES NOT prove a scam.
@_date: 2015-03-26 14:32:22
I'd be concerned, though like anything they took matters well and it's a good sign of a business taking initiative. Reminds of Bitstsmp.

It's had resistance since $290, why post all these silly topics here? Before you know it all your comments about $210 and $215 and $220 will just flood the news area and you'll annoy people over it.

I bought $6000 at $260 when I unfortunately moved my BTC to Bitgold, converted it back so I've made $1200 since that point. However, regardless of the money aspect the last time we hit around $210-217 it crashed back down to $200, things could change but we did hit around $308 early AU time and went back to $298 by morning now back at $302 - time will tell, it's a gamble so you'll need to learn when to pull out.

Usually smaller town banks, don't quote me on this for the US, usually are slower when it comes to transferring money either domestic or international. Your larger more profitable banks usually have quicker transfer times *usually*, for the bank I bunker down with they simply do a 24-hours first transfer which takes a day or two and then each and every transfer after that is instant as long as that person remains in your address book! However, I think they despise Bitcoin.
One thing I like about our bank as well is you can do ATM Cash withdrawals without needing your card, so essentially I could have my parents withdraw say $200 from the closest ATM to them with the digits I give them, no matter where in Australia they are.

People default on Credit Card payments, not sure how they will curb it on BitLending, unless I'm blind as a bat but for my lending days they are over - already lost $100 in investments at BTCJAM and that was enough.

Ran my own business for 6 years, lot of our FRAUD came from PayPal registered customers. We'd had enough of PayPal and it's lack security and chose to ditch PayPal payments and stick with 2CO at the time.

Guess that is the nature of Credit Cards, don't ask me I am no banker but obviously there are reasons. Yet as the other guy said it doesn't relate to Bitcoin - yes I can see what you are advertising that Bitcoin would be quicker to refund as you'd get it instantly. However, AMAZON will probably never adopt it.

There FEES were too high and their support sucked. Not sure which I found more disappointing actually. I'd happily say I would pass using them for anything going forward. Can't change my mind.

It was at $420 earlier, before Huobi went offline. We are gaining traction again now and the volatility is calming down. I think we are in a good position for a rebound back to those figures later in the day :D
@_date: 2015-03-25 06:29:42
You're taking a good start for sure :)
I am based in Australia and I use  they were an Australian company until the Government treated bitcoin as a commodity to where GST or a Government tax would be added on top, so they moved to the UK where no VAT same as our GST is imposed other than their 1% buy in and 2% sell off of bitcoins. Love their service, sure beats the banks and their constant fee hikes and high rates on their silly credit cards - I'll be closing all my credit cards off soon and converting to BTC.

@_date: 2015-03-26 22:37:58
Ah well done! I knew they'd have to eventually respond, can't carry a business model of no one is there to run it :)
I think it's reasonable for sure that they verify the payment even if it requires some identity, there is no going around that in my honest opinion. 
The only concern I have is that they have a 0% buy in, however, look how much they give you back when you type how much you want to buy - I used  and got a price example and lost around $50 in value, not overly bad since coinjar charges a similar rate and they do it via BPay with a 1% buy rate.
Plus I have my debit card through them and it goes through the heritage bank here in Australia, quite a neat little card and you can convert money to it instantly :)
Where it comes to igot I do enjoy their service, they've got some better tools where it comes to paying bills but as of to date they won't beat livingroomofsatoshi that is a certain!!!
@_date: 2015-03-24 01:32:07
Cause their eyes are focused on the uptrends and the downtrends and the negativity of bitcoin. They focus out the rest of what Bitcoin really is.

Independent Reserve is good for buying in, not so much selling out. When you consider it, Coinjar gives a better sell rate than what Independent Reserve does, just a shame these limits cause me problems.

Look at it this way, if I was to sell my 16.463 BTC on IR I'd make $6700 round off, if I sell it via Coinjar, I would make around $7,000 round off - so the buy in may be higher, so you could buy via IR and sell via CJ - take your pick at the best options for you - though don't blame the vendor because something takes too long for your liking, gets you no where.
