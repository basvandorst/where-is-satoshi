Well, clearly it is, judging by the article. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:34:08


Then how do you justify its valuation? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:59:14
Solid points, nuanced perspective.

I think those figures overstate the danger somewhat.
1) It's international, diffused across countries
2) There aren't the same sort of negative externalities as exist with forclosed homes.
3) People don't live in their bitcoins
4) A lot of that value is bullshit, plain and simple. The capital loss on a lot of btc sold at 0$ is still gonna be below 1K$. People have been holding, artificially constraining the number of btc available for major use cases like wash transactions laundering money out of China.

Fun fact:
The US Dollar is named after the old currency in Mexico, the Spanish Dollar.

Well that actually could happen. People could simultaneously trade it for every price between 0 and something very high.
Its ludicrously unlikely, but possible.

Bitcoin could function fine as a medium of exchange with wide swings in value if people weren't holding it for long periods.

In 2001:
Google hadn't had an IPO
Facebook didn't exist
YouTube didn't exist
Amazon had never reported any earnings
China didn't have internet companies
The .com bubble had almost no connection to the current success of internet companies. The biggest connection is actually Microsoft.

Here is where you revealed that you're unaware of division. 
 &gt; At a market cap of $69 Billion and price of $4150 BTC can get pushed around.  Eventually as the Price/Cap rises the amount of capitol needed to push it around also grows.  
Trading volume is the only thing that matters for stability. If, in a day, only one coin was exchanged at ~4k, any old schmuck could create volatility by selling a coin the next day for 5k to his buddy.
Its only because trading volumes are ~0.7B$ that these sort of "random asshole attacks" are impossible.
Even if the market cap was 100x higher, if the trading volume was still just 4k, random assholes could swing it.
And btc could have a substantial devaluation and be stable. Only a tiny fraction of coins get used as a medium of exchange. Price could half, and trading volume double, easily. 
You're just so fundamentally wrong, don't bother replying.

That's not capitalization, that's price.
Though you're right that "capitalization doesn't matter" is wrong as a blanket statement, I think the meaning was clear in context.
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:18:02
No. It's trading volume that matters, not capitalization.

If bitcoin replaced Visa as the largest payment processor, and we somehow forced all transactions to be overnight (so there's a simple Vol/BTC valuation), BTC is already massively overvalued as a payment processor. And those are two somewhat absurd assumptions in favor of BTC payment.
Does this mean for certain that BTC is overvalued? No. For example, it could replace (be replacing) pallets of 100$ bills as the preferred store of value for warlords everywhere. More optimisticly, some nation could pull an Ecuador, decide they're incompetent to conduct central banking, and somehow integrate BTC. In between those two, countries under heavy sanctions could use it, or it's possible that there's something missing on the payment processing story I told earlier, like the size of the global black market, or needs for money laundering actually being more constraining than 1btc per day.
But if your hope is just "new PayPal" that likely doesn't justify investing.

Your bitcoin is pretty much guaranteed to pay off better than if you were blowing it on booze. If nothing else, just focus on learning shit.

The slightly practical scenario is that somehow a ton of coins are lost in an attack, but volume recovers after the attack.

No. Almost nobody has cash savings meant for retirement. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:24:22


Almost nobody actually does that. 21% of Americans don't have a savings account, 62% don't have 1k in theirs. Yet median wealth is 45K. People trade money for things they want, and only retain money in anticipation of unexpected sudden expenses.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:12:38
Lol.

It is literally so insignificant that it is not tracked by any major source of economic data. They track things like % with 401k, pensions, ira, relying on private business investments, etc, but not cash hoards. You're the one who asserted it was in the millions, you're the one who has a positive assertion to defend.
