Hi im new to bitcoin.  Can you explain to me *why* this is true rather than just asserting it?


What property of bitcoins make them unable to work in that particular market?
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:55:09
But gold has uses in medicine, electronics, jewelry, etc.  That is what I mean by "intrinsic value."  Ultimately, are BitCoins anything other than strings of characters?  Can they be put to any application or use other than being representations of value?

I'm new to bitcoin so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, just stating things as I currently understand them.
Doesn't gold retain value because it has intrinsic value as a quantity-limited physical object wtih unique characteristics?  I understand that BitCoin is also a quantity-limited system, but does it have any real intrinsic value or purpose?  Is it *solely* based upon a value we place upon it or is there some intrinsic usefulness of a bitcoin?

No, not surprised at all; pointing it out that its not a "conspiracy theory" to assume some shady dealings are happening.

I was pointing out the irony of calling someone else naive and following up with a conspiracy theory as support

This has to be a bubble.  There's not enough vending to handle all of this capital.  Vendors' businesses are actually not doing as well because people are currently afraid to purchase *anything* using BTC because the rising value means that within 15 minutes they've already overpaid.

With another conspiracy theory...


"Doesn't matter if the conspiracy theory is true or not, because of [different conspiracy theory]"

Same here.  Emailed them almost 6 days ago, no response.  You won't hear anything from them unless you make it a public problem like by posting it  here. 
good luck.

because 


Is so very convincing.  "Oh we could stand to gain millions but we're too honest for that.  We're super serial.  No proof but.. just trust us."

[Here it is](
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:29:40


This is a conspiracy theory.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:13:53
Lol.   "That is such a naive way to look at it" followed by the stereotypical teenager-angry-at-the-world perspective on the centuries long banking conspiracy
