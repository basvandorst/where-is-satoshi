One thing I have always said is, if you want to get someone's attention, reach into their wallet. If the US gubmint sees tax revenue that it isn't getting, it will damn well get it or kill everything in the process.

People that can swing deals like this, aren't typically average joes that forget anything.

Oh, I agree. It's an interesting concept, and that's why I have subscribed to r/bitcoin, but I just don't think it will really catch on, partially for the reasons you suggest. I'm not rooting for or against it, but the concept of a 'people's currency', devoid of governmental control, is intriguing to me.
-edit- But as far as gold's intrinsic value, anything is only as valuable as people allow it to be. Is gold more valuable than water? On the currency markets, yes. But get stranded in the desert for a few days and see how that view changes. Because of this, I can't *completely* count out Bitcoin as a viable player in the future.

While bitcoin may hold long term promise, keep in mind that Bernanke thinks printing billions of dollars quarterly to pay debt is a fine idea. . This current policy is keeping the economy from any growth. The looming inflation explosion that this current policy is going to cause is going to kill our economy, but may actually be the spark that ignites this type of non-government based/backed currency. He is an architect of one of the worst economies in American history, so take his thoughts with a grain of salt.

Whilst, I am doubtful that Bitcoin will ever be used as a mainstream currency, gold and all other forms of currency go up and down as well. The dollar is no where near its peak value. For a short time in the 1980s, the British pound was valued, at just about, even to the dollar, when historically, it is rarely under $1.60. The Euro fluctuated greatly when introduced and has now stabilized. Bitcoin is really too 'new' and isn't widely used, so its true value is hard to determine.
