Money is a result of an activity. As long as I get to do what I'm interested in and have enough to live comfortably, I'm happy.

I did not get fired. I was relocated to a more "suitable" office.

Yes. I have already gotten several private messages from well known community members. While maintaining pseudo anonymity I will vest and prove my credentials/pseudo identity to verify where I have worked and what my function was. Stay tuned.

I'd rather be back on Wall Street. While infinitely less transparent the available research resources are boundless if you can deliver valuable analysis. I enjoyed my time at the Fed, even with the money being relatively poor, but this was the last straw.
I am not tasked with making policy recommendations, just analysis of the outcomes of current policies and future policies under certain circumstances so I do not sit in those meetings. My guess is they will try to actively restrict and restrain bitcoin until the inevitable happens.

No, it was about our declining bana bending machine exports to the Banana Republics. They're branching out.

Well if nothing else works out, maybe I can be the next Michael Lewis.

Both. The technical properties serve as a primary input, otherwise the modeling/simulations would be worthless.
@_date: 2014-08-05 17:57:42
Yes which accounted for the variance in the aforementioned time window. I don't want to get into the confidence intervals, but in short the time window is statistically significant based upon all of our assumptions (inputs) but obviously those can change. All we can do is take our best data analysis and feed them into our simulations to come up with a forecast.

Doesn't work like that. The Fed rarely transfers talent across regions. They operate much more as autonomous entities. It's not like a large tech company shipping you from one office to another to work on some project.

I'm not a bitcoin fanatic. My technical exposure to bitcoin was based around a FPGA design in cryptography where bitcoin was chosen as an interesting domain experiment. 
I unlike apparently many people here do not hold significant amounts of my net worth in bitcoin. I have had a few dozen, but these were mined in early adoption stages and were distributed for research purposes and only a couple are still untouched.
Looking back on it now I wish I had been more of a fanatic. Alas, I am not. Like I described in my post, I am much more fanatical about econometric research and the evolving macro global economy. Whether it is bitcoin that changes things or some other currency, I couldn't careless. Either would be fascinating.

I am in the process of doing this. Currently vetting journalists at Bloomberg and Spiegel. Many more have gotten in touch on Reddit as well as in response to my IRC and Newsgroup messages.

I have kept things broad and used some misdirection on purpose. The amount of people with similar pedigree producing similar reports is non trivial. I also have very good experience with NDAs having worked in the trading industry.
@_date: 2014-08-05 18:45:16
Plausible, but they would not pay for a costly relocation and separate the team for a regular busy work cycle.
@_date: 2014-08-05 17:36:11
True. You can take the information as is. If you know how the Federal Reserve works, every office operates independently working on many research projects. The fed is the largest employer of economists and statisticians with a lean towards economics and a majority of the work is funded under umbrellas and publicly undisclosed (not that most of it would be of any interest anyways). Once something gets enough exposure within the Fed, it is is reviewed by a peer council and then disclosed for the conference circuit. 
Any research (like this) bound under classified nondisclosure will never be disclosed.
I may or may not publish some evidence at one point or another, but it would be foolish to give any more details here.

The organizational structure at the Fed is rigid and ingrained. It's all about seniority and self preservation of the institution and their outdated theoretical beliefs. I'm not the first to get put in a padded room.

See my other responses. [1]( [2]( [3](
I do not have a vested interest in bitcoin nor am I afraid of tainting my professional career. I have plenty of opportunities regardless of a bitcoin dominated world or not. I posted to share some insight into the inner workings at the world's largest central bank. Do not weep for me, I'll be fine. The same might not be able to be said for a lot of my colleagues in a decade.

Mix it with some Michael Lewis, Alex Jones, and the guy from ZeroHedge and we could have a best seller.

Disclosing the bits I have are not risky. Either you take the information and process it or throw it out. I could not care less, but judging by the response I have gotten, many people are appreciative.
@_date: 2014-08-05 18:02:12
True. Even more so with my background I tend to do a cost benefit analysis for many of my decisions where I quantify each factor. Money beyond a threshold is just typically lower on that scale for me.
