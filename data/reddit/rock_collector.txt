Xapo does indeed feel that bitcoin will go that high. Danny Bocanegra of Xapo was speaking at the Chicago Bitcoin Conference a couple of weeks ago and mentioned that Xapo's insurance policy covers up to $500,000 per bitcoin.

The last ARG puzzle by Coin_Artist was incredibly challenging, exciting, and collaborative. I was amazed at the intelligence and talents of the gamers. So many skill sets are involved. Crypto, gaming, general coding, visual, audio, etc etc.  This new one promises to be much much more. Everyone can play a part.
This new one starts out by learning to play around in/with the blockchain. You'd be amazed what you will learn about how the blockchain works and all the tools available to understand it. The prize should increase as the puzzle continues. Puzzlers and outsiders will add to it, and perhaps, if it's like the last one, Coin_Artist will increase the amount with cryptic clueing via btc amounts.
As I just left the forum, a participant had discovered secret code in the output scripts of a blockchain transaction clue, explained how to convert it to text, and revealed the lovely poem that resulted. This poem is not only a revelation of an embedded code that appeared long ago in a block of the early blockchain, but possibly also a clue to a later stage in the puzzle. 
If you like puzzles and you love bitcoin, this is the greatest way to combine your passions and learn something in the process.
edit: oh yeah, and possibly win some bitcoin

not sarcastic. He says he has a few kinks to work out and will publish code in a week or so
