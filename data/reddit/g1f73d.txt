Tell them to cash out when they hit even money and go back to their 5% bank Isa. Haha �� they’ll learn when it’s too late.

It sounds stupid but I'm waiting for the Sunday dip. Expecting an even cheaper price if I can hold out long enough.

Short run. US has just woken up, I'm waiting until Sunday dip.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:05:36
Nobody knows the best time to buy. But judging from the usual weekend dip, I will be waiting until Sunday. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:26:39
Charlie lee? Haha ��

Amazing, where is it?
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:05:59
Buy an amazon gift card with bitcoin. Alternatively cash out at a local bitcoin ATM or sell your coins at localbitcoins.com.

She's lost nothing unless she cashes out. Rome wasn't built in a day.

Will it rain tomorrow, possibly.
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:49:13
Really appreciate your feedback, but I don’t use coinbase or bitpay. My site uses gocoin to accept bitcoin payments. 
I’ll take into consideration your comments and have a read at the links you have provided. Cheers
@_date: 2017-09-12 05:33:57
You could buy assets with btc: properties, vehicles and sell them.

@_date: 2017-06-19 10:57:43
Damn... you must be so curious about how many bitcoins are on that USB
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:03:14
Just double checked, dashboard is working fine and also the app. Sometimes I have trouble with the app loading properly. Conveniently when a coin is very volatile. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 13:52:29
It's working fine for me 
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:52:46
Where did you get this information from?
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:32:29
You need money to make money, that's the problem. Nobody can guarantee a nice profit, good luck. We are all in the same boat. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:37:21
Great, good news. Have you tried withdrawing cash from coinbase? I've heard people have had problems withdrawing. I haven't tried yet.
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:58:52
Has it been claimed yet? If it's legit I'll message a few Korean friends!
