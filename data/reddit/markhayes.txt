We had all of our stores in a public marketplace but fraud became too much of an issue. We may move in that direction again, but in the meantime we feature our stores via our blog, social media &amp; press ops all the time. 
In the next couple days you can expect a roundup of all the best stores accepting Bitcoin on our company blog ( so stay tuned! :-)

Not for long. We (Shopify) already have a few hundred stores accepting Bitcoin.

Haha I spend half my paycheck on items found on our Instagram account. :)

We don't publicize a list of all our merchants.
If you're interested in seeing all the Shopify stores that accept Bitcoins, we're putting together a blog post for Black Friday that showcases the best.
