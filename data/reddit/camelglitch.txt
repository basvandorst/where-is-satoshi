Wait a minute, isn't Ben lawsky the asshole that wrote the new laws and then turned around and started  a company to help people navigate the cluster fuck he created?

I tried last night and didn't have any problems. It took 4 hours to get the phone call to verify who I am (which is way too long in my opinion,but I'm sure they are very busy right now) but once I did they let me withdraw with no problems. They watch accounts like crazy trying to prevent people from impersonating someone else , which could be good or bad depending on your outlook but they haven't given me a hard time in the last 3 years.

I'm not an software/hardware developer but I would assume that if a security flaw in the raspbian OS was found then it might be able to be used to steal your funds. This is something you definitely wouldn't want plugged into the internet all the time.

Are you sure you need .25 BTC and not 25 bits? .25 BTC would make that skin about $90 USD.

Wow. I'm clearly in the wrong business. ...
