Yeah handling such trade without escrow is close to impossible - even if you were to send me the card info first, you'd still have the card and could spend it before I do, conversely, customer might just scam you by spending the card the second he receives it (without sending you btc).
I'd be willing to go through the hoops, but I just need $20 or so anyway which is not worth it unless it's your business. Which is why I'm looking for some at least semi-reputable established vendor.

Yep, the small time window between blocks is a tell tale sign of that.
Note that this may happen even if there are transactions in mempool which pull a lot of "random" inputs - bitcoind lags few miliseconds until it responds with new block template, because it is busy verifying signatures of inputs.
In the meantime the mining pool script provides empty template to miners (it needs only known prev_hash to do that) so as to minimize wasted hashpower because of bitcoind lag.

Yes, I need to get the CC# for BTC. Mail delivery is out of the question.
I live in a country where you can't even get VISA/MC or Paypal via legal means - now my evil bussiness plan is exposed (the risk for the vendor is actually violation of USG economic sanctions against my country).

Internet penetration over there isn't *that* bad - 
What you're suggesting is SMS interface to a wallet stored on some fools server, like coinbase or coinapult or .... Well, people in this country lost all their money few times, sure they would not mind if that happened again....
Android phones are dime a dozen too. Whats wrong with people actually keeping their private keys?
EDIT: Interesting twist - money is often pooled in family. You bascially need one android phone with keys which will answer to SMS (ping-back? passwords? OTP? S/KEY?) RPC from dumb phones which know no better...
Still, without proper sim toolkit implementation, it's all horribly insecure, useful maybe only for micropayments. SIM toolkit could of course totally do this whole hw-wallet thingy, except nobody implemented secp256k1 on smartcard yet. The cards, unless massively produced, would be probably more expensive than cheapest chinese android phone.

Didn't know, thanks: Looks like a nice alternative to bitmit, there are several prepaids. I'll try to convince someone there to just unpack it and send me the

No offense, but we don't know each other's [OTC rating]( The problem is I need to do this on regular basis as I'll redistribute the CC# to other people.
If they did something bad with the CC (say, buy stolen goods on ebay or whatevs), it would be on you where as vendor would have to just say .. hey, i'm just selling those anonymously, see, here's my e-shop.

I've looked into raxcard and they seem somewhat sketchy (especially the blogspot spamvertising). They seem to cater mostly to shady russian audience (say, like BTC-E does), which is not necessarily a deal breaker.
However, didn't find either positive or negative reviews.
I'd give it a try if they were offering simple process, payhere, here is CC  but they appear to be sending only plastic too.

There was no ban, just tax. Not anymore.
Zimbabwe government waived the duty on IT equipment just recently, and the market is flooded with androids as we speak.

Interesting - signing proposed transaction would certainly fit into MIDP profile of old GSM phones. What about lack of internet connectivity? Server sends 3-4 sms with tx to sign, client responds 1 sms back with signature.
Hmmm....
