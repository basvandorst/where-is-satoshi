It makes me cringe that so many people actually believe that’s how currency and economies first developed in proto-civilisations.
@_date: 2018-08-15 11:38:34
I guess you don’t live in the EU

Like we couldn’t make bitcoin look any more like a cringey libertarian fever dream.
@_date: 2018-08-31 08:53:33
No lol
The ‘barter economy’ never really existed in history anyway.
It went from gift economy in isolated communities to proto-currencies once society started to organise and needed to compensate soldiering and traders.
@_date: 2017-02-12 14:33:47
Do you have any quick tips?
Like rather than simply buying a small amount every week, should I space out my purchases and try and aim buying larger amounts during the dips?
For example, should I purchase a whole months worth of btc savings during this current dip?
@_date: 2017-02-12 15:14:36
Well I'm aiming to keep enough money in my normal bank account saved for actual emergencies. I'm thinking at a 50/50 split between normal banking and bitcoins. But healthcare is free, and I don't own a car and over the last decade I can't think of a time when I needed money immediately.
The next time I think I'll have to convert coins back into real money would be for flat downpayments in 4-5 months.  
But yes I realize most people in this subreddit would have a more idealistic vision for bitcoins. But its nice to get peoples opinions.  
@_date: 2017-03-11 17:26:36
Hands up. But only with 2/5 I recently bought still in the exchange. You live and learn, I haven't really lost anything it was just all unnecessary movements  
@_date: 2017-03-02 14:55:17
Talk about evangelicalism lmao
@_date: 2017-03-01 18:23:14
I agree, but my income isn't great so I don't put much into coins beyond normal saving. So I want to maximise the best I can from putting £50 aside every week. My btc fund is at £300 now so I'm just waiting for the next significant dip. But I don't want to alway be waiting hoping a better price is just around the corner.
Do I purchase now or wait for after eft. It's a dilemma for us bitcoin novices. I'm not trying to get rich, just get the best value out of my savings - more than I do at the bank.
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:02:34
I use coinbase. I do have some problems with their website authorising 3D secure credit cards, but when it works the experience is okay. 
Not Stella recommendation but they work for me - and the UI is nice.

Bitcoin will be around until something better comes along and kills it off. But that is easier said then done.
Altcoins are pretty trash 
@_date: 2017-03-01 18:08:30
The real question is when should I buy in :/
I just started purchasing a small amount of coin weekly. Got it up to 0.12 before this price hikes started. Now rather than using the weekly money for coins I'm just putting it aside to dump in the next dip. 
Is this sound practice? Or shall I continue the weekly purchase. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 18:41:32
Obviously. But some times are better than others
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:34:22
People can't access the exchanges to dump their coins lol

See here lies the root of your privileged chauvinism. "Willing to take the risks".
Great job buddy I'm glad you're materially comfortable enough to push your stupid schemes onto genuinely oppressed and suffering people.
People in Venezuela cannot afford to take such risks and crypto currencies might never provide the correct solutions for the worlds poor and oppressed. It can develop into something useful in the future but to post stupid threads like this is completely disingenious.

“It’s a form of tyranny. But, that’s the whole point of corporatization — to try to remove the public from making decisions over their own fate, to limit the public arena, to control opinion, to make sure that the fundamental decisions that determine how the world is going to be run — which includes production, commerce, distribution, thought, social policy, foreign policy, everything — are not in the hands of the public, but rather in the hands of highly concentrated private power. In effect, tyranny unaccountable to the public.”

Funnily enough I work in a restaurant. It doesn't matter if it's busy, if the service starts slipping you got serious problems.
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:50:59
So there is no scaling issue?

Here in the EU it's free and instant mostly
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:24:44
No. 
But if that restaurant can't cope with the demand...
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:46:44
Then why is there this bullshit civil war going on over the quality of service lol
I would be wary of hubris 
@_date: 2017-05-06 12:10:44
This wasn't the case for most people. Mine has always been near instant for as long as I remember 
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:23:53
For all of bitcoins merits, nothing is quicker, cheaper and easier than more traditional methods of moving money. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:40:57
And those who do get in are having bad service because they can't cope. So the reputation begins to slip.
It happens all the time in the restaurant industry so I'd advise using it as an analogy. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:20:37
Its hard to see bitcoins intrinsic value go up so high when it becomes more and more unsuitable to perform, especially compared against newer competitors. 
Its value probably will continue to to appreciate for the next handful of years - mostly through market dominance and inertia. But I feel because so many people are 'all in' into bitcoin that they're more emotionally invested as they are financially. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:01:07

@_date: 2017-05-31 13:09:59
Bitcoin really is in decline. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:21:01
It doesn't.
He means people moving the value out of bitcoins into another, better crypto. 
Which to be honest is going to happen at some point. Bitcoins is a first generation crypto. Like the first airplane, its exciting and generated a lot of imitations but its no jet. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 01:38:25
No, Iceland strictly regulated its financial systems after the 2008 crash. 
Bitcoin falls under the 'unregulated mess' to them 
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:15:21
No. They tacitly suggested selling for now.
@_date: 2017-05-08 21:00:35
It would become worthless when a more suitable and viable platform is created.
Think of bitcoins as a similar concept as the first cars. It was a natural modernisation of the horse and cart, the concept was sound and it would bring about a revolution in transport. The first were niche, appealed to few and were plagued with technical problems. But the idea was to stay.
