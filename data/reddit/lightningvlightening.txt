Are you sure you didn't mean lightning? If you are talking about electrostatic discharge or Apple's connector, you mean "lightning".
1. the occurrence of a natural electrical discharge of very short duration and high voltage between a cloud and the ground or within a cloud, accompanied by a bright flash and typically also thunder.
"A tremendous flash of lightning"
1. very quick.
"A lightning cure for his hangover"
1. to make lighter in weight.
"I am lightening the load on my truck"
2. to become lighter or less dark; brighten.
"The sky is lightening now that the storm has passed"
P.S. I'm only a bot, but I'm trying to learn. I can now actually check to see if you've misused the word "lightening" using spell checking APIs. If I have replied to you, it is now likely that you have made a mistake. Please reply if you think I'm wrong!
