No one? With block rewards of $6 million every 10 minutes... But I'm sure you're meaning non-mining full nodes. That's a pretty bleak assumption considering the hundreds of millions of people who have a vested interest in the decentralisation of the protocol at that stage, to say nothing of major institutions who would full nodes as a cost of doing business and as a service to smaller businesses. Satoshi rightly had zero problem with this outcome. 
You guys make such a big deal about everyone having the ability to run Bitcoin and keeping it decentralized with small blocks, but if most people can't afford to use Bitcoin then you have a situation similar to large blocks where only large institutions will run full nodes. 


Because we didn't get into Bitcoin to create a hipster coin for the rich. 


I guess some of us care about the developing world and don't want to see Bitcoin become a play thing for the developed world. 


Yes... Maybe!

On the contrary, my tweet gets at the heart of the issue. Capping the block size means that there's no ceiling on how high Bitcoin transaction fees can get... But that isn't even the point. This camp **wants** fees to increase significantly, which has significant economic implications for _who_ can afford to use Bitcoin. 


It's a breakthrough, just not a huge one if most people can't afford to use it. Decentralized high-frequency transactions for rich people... Leaving everyone else being forced to use them as gatekeepers. 


The most important factor for users to access Bitcoin is the price of a transaction. 1 million anonymous layer-2 transactions per second is great, but totally superfluous if making on-chain transactions are prohibitively expensive.

So at $1000 to settle a transaction on the blockchain, each block would yield ~$6M in fees. At 144 blocks/day, this is ~$864M/day in fees ($315 billion per year in transaction fees).
- In this scenario, only institutions and wealthy individuals can afford to open let alone close transactions on the blockchain. With a hard cap on the block size, there is nothing stopping Bitcoin transaction fees going this high, assuming there is any demand to keep using Bitcoin at this point.  
- You can achieve the same fee-yield by increasing the block size to 20 GB, which will give a transaction rate of 60K tx/s (which is between Visa and Alipay peak processing rates) targeting a transaction fee of ~$0.18/tx... which is a price that **everybody** can afford **and** makes the lightning network actually affordable for people to use.  
- 20 GB every 10 minutes isn't factoring in the size savings of segwit, Xthin blocks or Compact blocks or anything else... just using what we have today. With that transaction rate and fee, you can achieve meaningful scalability and add tens to hundreds of millions of users who have an incentive to keep the system sufficiently decentralized.
@_date: 2016-08-14 20:50:39
It needs to be bloody affordable to access, which means that on-chain transaction fees need to be low. 
It doesn't matter how fast or amazing layer 2 systems are, if the price of admission is too high, no one can afford to use it except for intermediary institutions and the wealthy. 
There is no avoiding on-chain scaling of Bitcoin.

Gavin couldn't take the cryptographic proof with him for further analysis and independent verification... So if there was some shenanigans on Craig's part, it is unreasonable to expect him to have detected it in the couple of hours he had with Craig with all the limitations they imposed on him. Not even the mighty Greg Maxwell would be able to either (though I doubt Greg would have agreed to Craig's terms). 
Whatever proof was shown Gavin et al needed to be independently verified, and it was terrible judgement on their part to stick their necks out for Craig without this. And they've paid the price for this mistake.

@_date: 2016-04-20 10:33:52
There is a meme going around that the OpenBazaar developers don't care about privacy and anonymity.
It is nonsense. 
Software development is about tradeoffs, the bigger picture, and prioritizing your effort with the limited resources you have. To that end, we have always told everyone who asked that:
1. We will look at any viable pull requests that will enable Tor or I2P.
2. The reason why we've opted for rUDP for p2p connections is because it overcomes problems with NATs and we don't have to ask your in laws to setup port forwarding on their crappy ISP-provided router. Basic reliable p2p connections are the priority and the base we want to build on.
3. It's true we're not personally eager to support Tor and I2P because of the risk that it will be initially flooded with drugs and unspeakably worse things... And the bigger picture, the reason we're building OpenBazaar in the first place, is to create a permissionless marketplace that everyone will use. The risk of illicit items overwhelming the marketplace and sabotaging mainstream traction is real. There are bigger and more important things at stake than getting people cheap high. 
4. The backend of OpenBazaar is going to be switching to IPFS... So if you want Tor and I2P compatibility, talk with the IPFS devs... Which we have incidentally, because it is on our roadmap to support, it's just not early enough for some people.

That's a guess. You have no way of predicting how consumers and institutions will use the L2 protocol and how often they will settle on-chain.
But even if we assume you're correct, it's an irrelevant assumption. It doesn't matter how frequently users settle on the blockchain. If on-chain transaction fees are too high, it will price people out of Bitcoin and the L2 protocol.

Cites no evidence, and if you're referring to the spelling/grammar PR thing, please choose something more substantial to base your criticism.




You are poorly twisting words here, but in case you honestly didn't get what I was saying: (i) reliable p2p connections are hard enough without layering the complexities of Tor/I2P well enough to give guarantees to people that they won't go to jail if they sell something that happens to be illegal in their territory... your basically asking everyone to take on the OPSEC risk that Silk Road was responsible for, and we take that seriously enough not to half-ass it, (ii) our preference and development priorities (as far as our own work is concerned) is focused on mainstream adoption and non-illicit goods to be widely bought/sold on the platform... but if someone has the time and skill, and they submit a PR that enables Tor/I2P, then we'd 100% consider it and merge it if it works properly.... guess how many people have done that? 


Well yeah, since they're developing and maintaining the DHT and networking backend. One of the awesome things about IPFS is that they already support IPv6 connections, which was something on our roadmap that we don't have to do now. For IPFS, their entire focus is on improving their protocol and network connectivity, including solving difficult problems like supporting Tor/I2P, which frees us up to focus way more on the market protocol.

I understand what you're getting at, but try looking at it from this perspective:
BIP101 is a _transaction capacity_ target, and a _conservative_ one at that, assuming:  
1) off-chain transactions have a negligible effect in reducing on-chain transactions (this is an empirical question, best we can do is assume the worst and hope for the best),  
2) protocol efficiency improvements aren't enough to scale bitcoin's transaction capacity in the **long term** (segwit is **great** for short term increases in the tx capacity, _if_ the block size limit isn't changed)  
3) adoption significantly increases to the point where the on-chain transaction capacity requirements are somewhere between Alipay (forget Paypal, too small!) and VISA... if the network can't accommodate this demand, then Bitcoin is crippled and suffers consumer failures  
To your core point: yes we have a lot left to do... yes I'm mostly happy with the direction we're heading (if I don't hear a convincing argument against segwit)... no I'm not happy that we'll have to go through this all over again in a couple of years, especially if the lightning network or similar protocols have a negligible effect in reducing on-chain transactions.

It's a matter of priorities and not a dramatic clash of ideology as you may suggest. We need peers to reliably connect to each other with a robust trade protocol... there are so many things that can go wrong without adding the headache of TOR or I2P.
Building in anonymity that has strong opsec so that users don't have to worry about it is a major project unto itself and frankly not on our list of priorities in the next 12 months.
@_date: 2015-12-27 22:35:09
I want to highlight something for you to consider rather than refute some of your points, as I think there's a lot of data out there already. 
If on-chain transaction capacity in bitcoin is prohibitively constrained, then Bitcoin will suffer a *consumer failure*. The closest comparison I can think of is PGP: great protocol but practically unuseable by ordinary consumers. Adoption stalls and then fizzles. You'll definitely maintain decentralisation, albeit of a small network that hardly anyone uses because they're priced out of the network. 
However it does not naturally follow that raising the block size will significantly centralize the network more than other factors (such as the development of new mining equipment, which is why it's no accident that China has the majority of the hashing power).
@_date: 2015-12-02 04:10:02
Based on examination of the schedule, I'm guessing that the decision will be made by on the 8-9th of December.
@_date: 2015-12-08 01:24:49
- The tl;dr is that there will be **no increase in the block size limit**. Rather, _transaction capacity_ will be increased by various efficiency improvements to the protocol, which Greg describes in detail in the post.  
- In the absence of a well-reasoned dissenting opinion about _segregated witnesses_, I don't think any reasonable member of the community (small or big blockist) can object to this and other protocol improvements. Kudos to Peter for [killing two birds with one stone]( - tx capacity and malleability.  
- What is unfortunate is that this resolution is effectively kicking the can down the road... but, granted, in the best possible way.  
- Frankly I don't buy the fear of centralization as a result of increasing the block size, which we hear from Core. To be honest, I think [we already live in that dystopian nightmare]( which was largely driven by ASIC mining... it's no coincidence that China holds ~60% of the hashing power given that they're a manufacturing base for ASICs. If I'm correct, then their premise for retarding the block size limit is fundamentally flawed.  
- To be fair, I acknowledge that latency and block propagation is a big problem as the average block size gets larger with adoption/scale. IBLT, weak blocks etc is sorely needed to offset that. In the meantime, I'm just not convinced that large blocks will make any difference whatsoever to the status quo, where some Chinese miners SPV mine and set block sizes that are economically rational for them.

 This is Peter's way of pushing his position on the block size debate. 
A fee market cannot be supported without RBF... but he took it a step further and made it relatively trivial for you to submit a zeroconf transaction with a higher fee and **different outputs**.
**What this really means for you is:** if you're selling coffee at your cafe, and someone pays with bitcoin, he can double-spend that transaction as soon as he's out door. 
Do you want to use Bitcoin as a transactional currency? Too bad, Peter Todd thinks his vision of Bitcoin is superior to Satoshi's.
Bottom-line: if you're a miner, boycott F2Pool. If you think you should be able to sell goods and services without the fear of double-spend attacks, put pressure on F2Pool and any other miner to drop RBF.

Correct me if I'm wrong here, but this would seem to put the nail in the coffin to zero confirmation transactions?
I could theoretically trigger a fake 0 confirmation transaction, spending an output I don't own with an invalid witness. 
If fully validating nodes keep the transaction in the mempool, but ignore the initial 'invalid witness' while waiting for a valid witness, then wallets would regard them as a 0 confirmation transaction. 
Will it work that way? Would it not even be considered a 0 confirmation transaction until a valid witness is produced? Could you flood the mempool with transactions with invalid witnesses?

Tor is incompatible with OpenBazaar as we use UDP and not pure TCP for p2p connections between nodes. This is purely done to get robust connections between peers, for NAT traversal, and we're certainly not done working on this problem. For the time being, it is theoretically compatible with I2P.

- Clever :) But people have been calling the end of Moore's law time and time again  
- With today's hardware, assuming no Moore's law-style improvements in quality or price, it is still very cheap to store Terabytes of blockchain data, validate signatures etc  
- As for network connectivity, there are multiple countries around the world that are in the middle or are just starting to roll out national fiber optic networks. Network connectivity for ordinary consumers will be significantly faster than it is now in 5 years.  


- For starters the company that you refer to is OB1, in contrast to the free and open source project we work on called OpenBazaar  
- OpenBazaar is agnostic to whether the block size does or doesn't change.  
- We can make it work with the LN or a sidechain if it comes to that.  
- OB1 has probably more to gain by seeing the majority of transactions take place of the LN as we could set ourselves up as a payment hub and facilitate escrow... but that would likely introduce centralization (and government-regulated control) into the payment process, which is something we'd like to avoid.  
- Segwit means that the size of on-chain multisig transactions will dramatically go down, so the block size debate has little to do with the escrow model of OpenBazaar and more to do with preventing users from being priced out of the blockchain

This is based on false assumption that the cost to run a node remains stable over time &amp;&amp; a second false assumption that the block size has a significant impact on the cost to run a node. 
On  the major costs are the availability of state-of-the-art ASICs and electricity. Again, it is no accident that the majority of the hashing power is in China, as they are a manufacturing base for ASICs. ASICs and electricity have been the major driving forces behind mining centralization time and time again, yet the small blockists continue to shift the narrative to a red herring: connectivity.
Strong network connectivity is a less important factor as it is economically rational for miners to SPV mine in regions of weak connectivity under present conditions. Nothing will change that until fiber infrastructure is rolled out in several countries over the next few years. This argument will just look silly in the future. 
RE the mining subsidy, Charlie appears to not consider the role of_time preference_ in the economic decisions of miners. If they spend $1 in fiat to earn $0.5 worth of bitcoin today, it looks like an unsustainable business model... Unless you factor into expectations that deflationary pressures will make the mined bitcoin worth 10-100X as much in a few years time. 
Regarding the block size to increase fees is like regarding economic capacity to promote higher taxes to bring in more revenue for the government. It's the wrong approach, and it creates an elite class of users that can **afford** access to on-chain transactions and **increases centralization** for users who can't afford access to the blockchain due to the fees. And why? Because of an irrational fear of centralization that has been diagnosed due to an incorrect interpretation of history and short-sighted economic theory. 
While I applaud the efforts to improve the efficiency of Bitcoin (ie SW, LN etc), it's not a long term substitute for increasing the transaction capacity of the network. BIP101 or similar proposals that meaningfully increase the capacity is the only way forward.

Not even planned at this stage. Not because we have anything against TOR per say, but because making a p2p network is hard enough as it is when you throw in NATs etc. Also, and this is the big one, we're using rUDP for most comms, not TCP/IP. 
But it's an open source project, if anyone with talent wants to make a PR with unit tests, we'll take a look at it. 
@_date: 2015-06-21 11:17:54
**Highlights/extract from text:**  
_Problems_  
1. Hot/cold wallet dynamic sucks  
2. Escrow services can be corrupted and screw you  
3. TX malleability  
_Value proposition_  
  - But what would you say if we told you all these problems and more could be solved with a new data structure based on **time-lock encryption**?  
  - And that this data structure could be used with Bitcoin today - requiring no additional changes - not even a soft fork or non-standard transactions?  
  - And further: that this data structure was deterministic - it’s basic behaviour could not be changed from the time it existed to the time it ended?
_What is time-lock encryption_  
- Our design starts with something called **time-lock encryption**, which is a secure way to send messages to the future.  
- The basic idea behind time-lock encryption is that you start with some random text and then repeatedly apply some computable function to scramble the input.  
- The output of this function then becomes the input to the next function and you keep applying it for however long you want your time-lock to last.  
- When you’re done with this process, the final key becomes the key that you use to time-lock encrypt information.  
- Now encrypt something and throw away that key so you’re only left with the random input you started with and now in order to decrypt your message, you would have to repeat every lengthy computation used to produce the time-locked key.  
- The function used to garble text is called a _cryptographic hash function_  
- When you’ve done the computations necessary to generate the final value you can use this value to encrypt a private key used in a public key scheme (like RSA).  
  - That way you don’t need to produce a new key every time you want to time-lock something and everyone is free to use the public key.
_Timechain_  
- What if you want to be able to provide a secure time-locking service to other people so they can encrypt sensitive information to be made available at a future date?  
- Using the timechain it is possible to produce information that can only be read after certain times.  
- In its most basic form the timechain is a chain of time-lock encrypted RSA keys at 5 minute intervals and the chain itself can be generated in parallel by using a super computer (e.g. a GPU cluster.)
... then a whole bunch of stuff that went over my head...
_What does this enable? (their claims)_  
1. Unhackable cryptocurrency exchange  
2. More reliable escrow service  
3. Unhackable smart contracts  
4. More reliable multisig wallets  
5. Unhackable timed matrix wallets

Once there was a young boy, Bob. His uncle gave him a small toy tractor for his eight birthday. Bob loved this tractor and obsessively played it all day long. He would play with the tractor after school, in the early morning... basically any opportunity he had. When he hit his teens, Bob installed 'Tractor Simulator' and obsessively played it all.the.time.
When he grew up, Bob's uncle died and left him a farm as per his will. Bob explored the farm and property, which consisted of a small house, a shed, and lots of land. After exploring the house and property, he last of all examined the shed. To his amazing surprise, inside the shed was a tractor. Elated, Bob started to fix up the tractor to make it work as best as possible.

Although I admit running censorship-resistant scripts is a cool concept, I just wonder whether the right balance will be met in terms of security.

I was just to highlight something I posted in one of the comments. There appears to be some confusion regarding the purpose of burning coins and *reputation pledges* in general:
1. The *reputation pledge* is primarily meant to help *mitigate* **Sybil attacks**
  - If you see a user on the OB network and they haven't made a reputation pledge, you should take any positive reviews with a large grain of salt... especially if the reviewers don't have any reputation pledges themselves.
  - If a user has a 0.01 BTC *reputation pledge* and has several positive reviews for other users who also have *reputation pledges*, then their reputation can be taken with a significantly smaller grain of salt
2. In no way is the *reputation pledge* our entire reputation system. Rather, it is one component of it... actually the entry point.
  - Dionyziz has outlined the web-of-trust system we're building at the moment [here](
  - Our web of trust is what we'll be using as the primary toolkit for building trust relationships on the network
3. There is no silver bullet when it comes to building reputation and trust relationships. 
  - Multiple factors need to be considered, and at the end of the day we also have some contractual safeguards (i.e. multisig, notaries, arbitration market) that layer on top of this.
4. Many of us don't really like the idea of burning coins either and would prefer something like time-locked bitcoins to serve as the *reputation pledge*. 
  - But guess what, **we need additional developers** (not necessarily donations) to help us do that. If you know anyone with the skills and time to help us build this sooner rather than later, please email us at project
@_date: 2014-06-27 02:01:46
I'm speculating, but I think we'd probably want to involve arbitration service providers in our alpha and beta testing. 
On our part we'd also need to have a discussion about polycentric arbitration law, in light of the Richardson contract model we're using. Pretty exciting stuff!

BitMessage is great, but there are certain things it can't do that we would like the client to automatically do in a straightforward way:

**Visa Transactions per second**  
- VISA handles on average around 2,000 transactions per second (tps), so call it a daily peak rate of 4,000 tps.  
- It has a peak capacity of around 56,000 transactions per second  
So we have to wait until 2038 before we get to the 2015 peak capacity of Visa... assuming the absence of lightning networks, sidechains, or other protocols unannounced/uninvented yet.

I think there is an important point to be made: some of you may want to help out but lack some coding skills or enough bitcoin (real or testnet) that you're able to part with.
**You can still help**
One of the major features of *OpenBazaar* is the notary and arbitration market. For **notaries**, we need folks to maintain nodes nearly 24/7 to help witness contracts and setup multisig address ( in a 2-of-3). For **arbiters**, we need you to start forming what will become a market polycentric merchant law for *OpenBazaar*, which means establishing precedents for judging disputes between buyers and sellers.
We need to discover what will and won't work, and how to best protect consumers when shopping on OB.
You can read more about our planned approach here: 
@_date: 2014-11-21 02:07:13
Hey An arbiter is only involved if a dispute arises. A notary is the third party key holder/signer for the multisignature escrow address. The notary can be selected by the trading parties (i.e. someone they both trust). At the moment, the notary is selected by the buyer (this will change in the next couple of releases), which is why we tell people not to do any *serious* trade on OB yet. Brian and I have recently drafted a proposal to enhances privacy of all parties (blinded and encrypted contracts, forwarding etc) and deniability for notaries (who can setup their node to operate autonomously). 
These are not easy problems to solve, but we're doing our best to address and implement them given our time and resource constraints.

Stealth addresses are more convenient and less prone to be screwed up by the user (if properly implemented).

Bitcoin doesn't need to be regulated, it is already transcendent to regulation in any meaningful way. 
If you want to do something other than asking the government to play nice, I suggest that you invest your time in:
1. Developing decentralised exchanges
2. Developing decentralised marketplaces
3. Helping merchant adoption and reinvestment of bitcoin

That's a great question that I personally take very seriously. I want to rephrase the question slightly: how are we going to solve the fact that certain goods/services etc will be sold over *OpenBazaar* that you may personally disagree with... what can an individual do?
As a dev team, we can do nothing... we don't have any magical keys to the kingdom to shutdown certain types of trade on OB, which is exactly the point of OB in the first place: censorship-resistance, in order to establish independence from any interference from governments and their sponsored monopolies imposing high transaction costs to commerce, and generally other bad actors.
Nothing would personally upset me more than to see certain types of goods and services being sold on OB that are unquestionably morally evil and personally distasteful (not necessarily wrong: e.g. Abba vinyl records). So what can I do?
Firstly, as a node on the network, you do not have to host contracts for certain categories of goods, services etc, that you disagree with, on behalf of other users. Secondly, and would need to confirm this, but my hope is that you can opt-out of hosting network data that would point other nodes in the direction of that content.
Ultimately, it's up to the individual to comply with local laws etc, we're just creating a platform for free, open, and secure trade that can't be censored... a real free market!

When you want to send Bitcoins to someone via a stealth address, you generate a shared key or a 'nonce' (your private stealth key + their public stealth key) and a Bitcoin public key to send the funds to.  
This nonce can be published on a forum, website or to the blockchain in the Bitcoin transaction (via OP_RETURN, OP_PUSH). The receiver then scans transactions for the nonce and attempts to generate the Bitcoin private key (crypto-magic using the nonce + your stealth private key). If it is successful, then the transaction obviously belongs to you and you can import/sweep the Bitcoin private key into your wallet.
AFAIK, SPV-based clients like Electrum do something like this anyway, so scanning each nonce wouldn't be that onerous. Plus there is a way to create a watch address so you know that you have received funds, though I don't fully understand this part yet. 
If anyone has more accurate/additional knowledge, please comment below.

While technically true, it won't necessarily be commonplace.
If an arbiter begins to collude with some parties to trigger surety bonds or some other fraud, their reputation will be hammered. If there is one service on *OpenBazaar* where a long-term reputation is critical, it is arbitration. This is all to say that there is a powerful disincentive for an arbiter to misbehave, as users are likely to prefer arbiters with an established reputation.
Also I personally expect arbitration organisations to form that permit certain users to join say *The Pinkertons Arbitration Group*, provided that they follow the SOP of the group.
@_date: 2014-04-14 03:14:47
I would add something more: fundamentally Bitcoin is about dethroning trusted third parties in a censorship resistant way. It is about creating a system that is regulated by code and not humans, that is entirely voluntary and accessible to any who want to be involved. Privacy is a critical component of that philosophy, but it isn't necessarily implemented in a foolproof way within Bitcoin... Hence the efforts of the unSYSTEM team (ie Amir and co.), also ideas such as stealth addresses etc.

Also, running an OB node isn't like running a Bitcoin full node... for starters, it isn't a blockchain-based p2p network. As a result, the system requirements are tiny in comparison.

You don't have to list the contract on OpenBazaar. You can write it up and email it, host it on a webpage (TOR), Skype it, or morse code it to your intended buyer etc.
All you need to do is important the contract into the client, which will handle the digital signing and finding arbiters from there.

@_date: 2014-08-08 22:13:48


Great question. Couple of points:
- As a notary you will receive a notification asking you to be a witness to the contract (I call it triple-signing as the buyer and seller have already signed the contract).
- The notary signs the contract and sends it back with the bitcoin multisig details appended to the contract (the notary is the third key in the 2-of-3 address).
- If the transaction goes ahead without incident, then the buyer and seller will sign the funds out of the multisig address and the notary isn't involved anymore.
- Notaries pick up fees when they have to use their key to release multisig funds for whatever reason (dispute, lazy counterparty)... So the notary will write a transaction with an extra output for their fee.
- Notarization is not automated at the moment but obviously it needs to be. It's on our to do list after beta (or if more developers join, we can code it in now).

Ugh, if we keep this up we'll be on subreddit drama.
The 95% bitcoin super fund was the thought experiment. Someone asked me above why not just buy it, why use the super fund? I responded and said that since the government is forcing us to make super contributions, these could be used to purchase bitcoin. 
The point about losses in super post-GFC was about 1) individuals not having control over their money in non-SMSFs, and 2) how it was invested by these funds and subjected to huge losses, some of which have not fully recovered... and that putting money into a fund that included bitcoin (not the 95% one, but just in principle) could have a huge upside.
So never did I say or suggest: people lost money, therefore go invest 95% of your super into bitcoin.
**Edit:** Looking at the comment above, I did say 'mostly in bitcoin' that probably suggested to others I meant the 95% fund, which I did not intend. Apologies.

*Ricardian contracts* for physical goods will come with some preset data fields that are essential for any and all trade on OB. But, this isn't restrictive as you can include custom data fields that the client, or any application, can parse.
As I've written somewhere else, OB contracts don't *need* to be hosted on OB itself... you can host them on a website, send them over BitMessage, Skype, carrier pigeon/raven etc. The contract can then be imported into the client to automatically facilitate digital signing, arbitration process, etc.

2 words: Open Transactions
Yes Ethereum and OT are compatible, but OT can accomplish nearly all of the major use cases of Ethereum without a Turing complete blockchain and the headaches that appear to go with it + a linear inflation model. And the fund raising and premining is suspicious for my tastes.

Well to start with we have multisignature escrow addresses between the buyer, seller and notary (service provider, can be anyone, not us). Funds aren't released from that address unless the buyer flags that it has arrived.
If there is a dispute, an arbiter is hired to examine the case. Like notaries, they can be anyone (not us) and there will be a marketplace for arbitration.
Reputation will be present within OB using a web of trust system that one of our team has designed. This is one of the last things we have to code into the client. We will also facilitate the use of surety bonds and good performance bonds into the contracts as time goes by (and hopefully insurance).
The bottom line is that you shouldn't use reputation as a silver bullet, but rather a combination of reputation and contractual mechanisms to protect yourself. Please refer to our documentation for more details. 
**Edit:** forgot to mention we will have proof of burn and/or bitcoin time-locked identities (ie assigning a cost on creating an identity to ward off Sybil attacks).
@_date: 2014-07-31 23:17:53

10 second block times is still to slow... day traders would still laugh us out of the room. Frankly I don't think blockchain-based solutions are the right approach here *for these types of exchanges*.
What may make more sense is to use bitcoin as collateral in a multisig address, and use digital tokens representing bitcoin and shares to enable rapid trading with low latency. 
If you can design a trustless or near-trustless clearing house, then it may just do the trick.
@_date: 2014-08-24 22:56:43
Yeah probably. If the contract is blinded, then the notary can claim deniability. Not sure how liable the arbiter is since he doesn't control the key.

Agreed :)

In Australia, the government forces your employer to send 12% of your income to a super fund of your choice. These funds will only be accessible to you when you retire (retirement age soon to be raised to 70 years old). You cannot access these funds before the retirement age without incurring a 50% tax penalty (yes, you read correctly... 50%).
Most of these funds take the money and gamble it on the stock market, bonds, commodities etc. In the wake of the global financial crisis, a lot of people's super funds got wiped out and there's been a pretty poor recovery since.
Given the expected deflationary effect of bitcoin on its price, a super fund denominated mostly in bitcoin could be a huge win for trustees when they retire.

I'm not sure that is correct.
Sending Bitcoins to stealth addresses had nothing to do with whether you have an SPV client or not. Secondly (and this part I'm fuzzy on, perhaps can clarify this), the mechanism by which you scan for transactions sent to a stealth address (provided the info is embedded in the tx) is the same as the one SPV clients use to scan for transactions sent your Bitcoin address.

Good question. Arbitration in most cases will require the arbiter to know what the item is. The arbiter will be able to accept/reject judgement of the case when a notary is used as the 3rd key holder. Because the notary digitally signs contracts and is the 3rd key holder in a 2 of 3 mutisignture escrow address, they can be blinded from the details of the contract by hashing and public key encrypting certain fields in the Ricardian contract. 
In a dispute, the merchant and buyer select an arbiter from the arbitration market to hear the case. The plaintext contact is sent to the arbiter for judgement. The arbiter indicates the verdict to the merchant, buyer and notary. The winning party and notary write the transaction releasing funds from the multisig address as per the verdict.

This has been one of our core values. We're kinda sick of vaporware projects and appcoins fundraising absurd amounts of bitcoin before the market has determined whether it has any use for it. Frankly, the creation of a censorship-resistant marketplace platform using bitcoin is too important.

While we appreciate some of the cheerleading, none of the OB Dev team want this project to be over-hyped, or have a situation where we over-promise features and are unable to meet unrealistic let alone reasonable expectations. Many good projects have suffered this fate, and it ends up leaving the community cynical and apathetic to projects that need their support.
We're working hard every day to make this project happen, which is a marathon effort not a sprint. Donations are nice but developers, technical expertise, testers and designers are what we really need.
@_date: 2014-03-11 04:13:40
We'll see if Ethereum replaces Bitcoin. The question is whether the network effect of Ethereum will overtake that of Bitcoin... Right now there's *just* a lot of hype. 
Comparing both technologies, Ethereum's key value proposition is a Turing complete scripting language and a linear inflation model (which IMHO is not desirable or valuable). 
While the scripting language is cool and I'm eager to see what people build using Ethereum, I am frankly concerned over the level of security in the protocol. 
Furthermore, I dislike their subtle message that with Ethereum you can all of a sudden do smart contracts etc, when these features are already built into Bitcoin.

Hey mate, developer from OpenBazaar here. 
First off it's great to see services like these pop up! We don't view them as competition at all as OpenBazaar isn't technically selling or arbitrating anything. Rather we hope that our platform will be used to facilitate business models such as this. 
What would be really cool is for the potential for established arbitration groups to have a presence on OpenBazaar so that users have a familiar option to start with when the client launches later in the year. 
All the best!

Basic transactions work, from listing to purchasing. The installation process is not friendly to users without a certain level technical expertise.
Also, OpenBazaar isn't just one thing. OB will not merely be a platform for buying and selling goods like on ebay. OB has the potential and will be used for much, much more than that. 
If we were keep OB in beta until all of our planned features are implemented, we wouldn't leave for several years. Our rationale was simple, get the basic purchase and sale of physical goods at a fixed price implemented and released for users to test out, which we've done. 
Since that time we've had several more developers join who have made substantial improvements to the network and overall performance of OB. Also we have finally switched to `master/develop` branches for development, which was one of the other reasons users ran into problems, as our master branch was changing on a daily basis (with some updates having unforeseen bugs). We've since incorporated *Travis build testing* to make sure that we don't break the build with an update, and updates will now go directly to the `develop` branch rather than the stable `master` (which will be updated from the `develop` branch at the end of each month). 
Beta 2.0 is slated for release in a few days, which will have several of these behind the scenes improvements.

OpenBazaar will give you the freedom to do that... but I personally think that the pre-selection of arbiters is common nowadays given the 'real world' state of the arbitration market. 
Let's say you and the merchant have a dispute about whether the courier delivered the good you purchased: 
1) You preselected the arbiter.  
  - This selection is made before the transaction, and therefore before any dispute  
  - This means you probably will select a *good* all-around arbiter  
  - A potential bottleneck is making a consensus selection of an arbiter that 9 times out of 10 you probably never have to use  
2) You select an arbiter from the arbitration once a dispute arises  
  - You shop for a *great* arbiter that specializes in resolving courier-disputes  
  - Both parties are invested into selecting the **best** arbiter for the job  
It's up to you, but I know which one I prefer.

Let's say I want to send you Bitcoins but I don't want anyone else to know about it. Maybe you have a gummy bear addiction that makes you a social outcast.. Doesn't matter, it's not anyone else's business why I'm sending you Bitcoin. 
I grab your stealth address, and I can send Bitcoin to you in a manner to protects our pseudo anonymity by ensuring that a new Bitcoin address is used for every transaction, without us having to coordinate for each transaction. In this way, transactions are somewhat deniable.
Ultimately, it's just a little more difficult to prove a person is sending funds to a known party, while making it easier for other people to send you funds. 
You can now buy gummy bears from a merchant via their stealth address and no one can easily prove that the Bitcoin address you used belonged to the gummy bear merchant. For the merchant, they don't have to issue fresh addresses for every customer. They can have their one stealth address associated with their pseudonym for all time without compromising their security or identity.

Ok, we keep getting this question, so please refer to this answer if you see the question pop up again:
1. **You don't need or have to burn coins** -- this is an option for you to fund your *reputation pledge*.
2. We will be supporting **time-locked coins** and outline a plan for **user-managed escrow addresses** for *reputation pledges*
3. Using coins to fund the dev team, a mining pool or a charity **can be gamed and abused**. We err on the side of caution and will not implement it.
4. Burning coins is the easiest way to bootstrap *reputation pledges*. For beta testing, you don't need or have to to burn any coins.
5. The *reputation pledge* is the not the sum total of our trust management system. It is 1 component of it that is to help mitigate Sybil attacks and signal to other parties how invested you are to your identity in OB.
6. *Reputation pledges* may not be necessary for people who publicly verify their real world identities with their node, as they are directly tying their real world reputation with their behavior in OB.
Hope this clears up any misconceptions.

Yeah we plan to support something like that. In the ebay description of a good you're selling, can put a link to an OB Ricardian contract (formatted in JSON) for the good. OB allows you to import the contract and connect to the node selling that good via the node ID included in the contract.

We are discussing a 'hide node' button and some **self-imposed optional** contract filtering (as you won't see contracts with certain keywords, but that will only work if the contract has keywords to begin with).
On your first point, stay tuned.

Hi Jimmy,
I think I speak for a lot of people who have wanted to donate to Wikipedia for a long time, but for one reason or another have been dissuaded by PayPal and the other payment options.
Bitcoin would remove **all** barriers for me to donate.
Also, I would humbly suggest that you would not be so quick to convert your Bitcoin to cash... hold onto it for the long term as much as you're able.
Who'd a thought you'd be engaging in two distinctly Hayekian concepts: 1) the use of knowledge in society, and 2) competing currencies!

I think the most important feature is the integration of **stealth addresses**. Apart from [SX]( I don't know any other implementation that has done it.

Author of the article here, I was pretty surprised to see this at the top of the Bitcoin subreddit today! I recommend you read Sam's comments in addition to some of my own thoughts:
1. These ideas are still being developed and don't necessarily reflect the final version of how OpenBazaar will operate. Also, we're very mindful of bootstrapping the basics first and building up from there. Having said that, auctions are pretty high on the list IMO.
2. Big kudos to OpenTransactions, who have been talking about Ricardian contracts and these sorts of systems for a long time... we're basically applying those same concepts to the OpenBazaar/DarkMarket platform.
3. We really, really need skilled and motivated developers to help turn these ideas into reality.

Look at the image again, the public key is what needs to be scanned in the blockchain, not the private key.
Edit: Misunderstood your statement, my bad. You'd only have to decrypt the private keys of new transactions that you have sent/swept into a new address.

One more example. Let's say Edward Snowden published a stealth address. You can donate to him without the government knowing that Bitcoin address you send funds to is controlled by Snowden. 
In fairness though, if Snowden then reveals he controls the address you sent funds to, then you could be ID'd if they can link you to the address you sent Bitcoins from. 
Bottom line: protect yourself, use mixers, CoinJoin (equal amounts as the other parties) and CoinSwap to protect your privacy.

There are a couple of good questions there:


If you want to make a direct payment to someone else (assuming no trade is involved), then you merely send Bitcoins to their address. But I assume this is not what you're asking.
The Ricardian contract is designed to be an under-the-hood system that does the following:
1. Establish beyond the shadow of a doubt the terms and conditions of the trade, authenticated by both users. This makes arbitration easier, as you have tamper-proof evidence of what the original trade conditions were. I encourage you to read the documentation (it's not that complex): 
2. It will be designed so that the scary JSON format of the Ricardian contract is not visible to the end-user (unless they want to see it). Ideally, you can still have a 1-click (or near 1-click) experience when purchasing goods... and a simple listing process that is aesthetically comparable to putting something for sale on eBay. We already have a prototype for this working, so this isn't as theoretically as it may sound.
3. Registering trade volume on a decentralised market place is challenging, although we have some ideas we're working on for specific applications where you need to measure trade volume (i.e. shares etc).
4. Buyer feedback will be handled outside of the Ricardian contract system (as this stage of design). It won't be too difficult to post a review on someone you traded with, proving that you traded with them without revealing the contents of what you traded. 
5. Frankly, buyer feedback is still early in design/development, as I have been thinking about to establish contractual safeguards to nullify the reward of fraudulent behavior... but I highly encourage you to contribute, which you can do on the forum: forum.openbazaar.org

One of the motivating factors is what I consider to be the primary vision behind Bitcoin, which is to transact in Bitcoins for goods and services directly... No cashing out, just Bitcoin. 
The real revolution is not when merchants and service providers start accepting Bitcoin, but when they stop accepting government fiat. 
Hopefully OpenBazaar will make a contribution to that vision.

If you've been around as long or longer than I have, particularly on this subreddit, you've seen things... things that you people wouldn't believe. This is to say that many projects have been heralded as the 'killer app that will change everything, revolutionize 'X', save pandas, cure cancer, and order a season 2 of Firefly'.
**OpenBazaar** will be a marathon project, not a sprint. There will be bugs, improvements, things we got totally wrong in the design that we will need to fix. More importantly, we will be adding support for new types of markets incrementally over time so that OpenBazaar isn't merely a p2p eBay, but something much bigger. As Brian Hoffman likes to say: OpenBazaar isn't a market, it's a market **platform**.
So next week you can expect a basic fixed price contract system working... where you can put a good up for sale at a price, and you can either choose to buy it or not. In the next couple of months we'll add support for auctions (in time for RC1 at the end of the year), then services (expect big things in this space), and many others.
So with some patience and humility, and we'll try to get this right.
Edit: some additions.

So for beta 1.0 we have been seeing all of the bugs and difficulties installing *OpenBazaar*. It generally breaks down this way:
1. Installation issues have to do with dependencies (one in particular, pysqlcipher that caused us hassles).
2. After it is successfully installed, you open up *OpenBazaar* and find that you're not connected to any nodes, or the nodes you're connected to are just the seeds and you can't see anyone else and their storefront.
  - most of the issues here have to do with port forwarding and setting up your router correctly
3. Most of the nodes I've seen on the network don't have contracts that I can see... Which can be frustrating.
This is why they call it beta :)
**Edit:** As of this morning, most of the nodes online have test contracts, well done guys!

Answer: - (ie not yes or no)
I don't think you understand how OB will work. Your question would be the same as asking Satoshi if bitcoins would be *allowed* to be used to buy drugs. While bitcoins can and have been used to buy drugs, neither Satoshi or anyone has the ability to control what bitcoins are used for. *That's the whole point... censorship resistance*.
Likewise, we don't have any control **at all** for what individuals will sell on OB (which are contracts that they host themselves on their node, or contracts on behalf of others IF they want to) any more than what they would sell on their street corner or garage.
If you don't want to buy porn, drugs, or guns, don't look for nodes hosting those contracts... and don't import contracts into the client that will connect you to nodes that do.
Edit: spelling

To add to what other's have replied, surety bonds can be used to hedge against the value of what you're trading... similarly, you can have 'good performance bonds' that punish one or both parties for not keeping elements of the contract (e.g. pay within 7 days).

This has not been my experience in talking with people about the balance of their funds. Your other points appear to split hairs with me.


Didn't know this bit, thanks!
**Edit:** I will address your first point because it's a valid one.


I don't disagree with this. The crux of my point is that I personally feel disenfranchised by super funds taking 12% (soon to be) of my income and investing it in a manner that I do not have direct control over... unless I have a SMSF, which the cost of compliance is a major barrier of entry for people in my income bracket. So to see my hard-earned income be *invested* in a diverse portfolio take a nose dive during the GFC was even more disenfranchising. For the older folk that I knew, it wasn't merely a paper loss for them when they saw over half of their portfolios wiped out in some cases. Even now, despite all the gains and recovery, they are still significantly set back.
This whole question is about empowerment, and whether I can 'vote with my feet' to put my superannuation into something that I believe will play out in the long term. Overall, it's about regaining some measure of control over my income that has been divorced from me by law. If I want to foolishly gamble by money on bitcoins, I will suffer the consequences and will have no one to blame but myself.
Taking a step back from the **thought experiment**, a 95% exposure to bitcoin is stupidly risky.
@_date: 2014-06-19 20:35:33


You got it. 
RE reputation systems, I don't want to depend on a reputation system to prevent fraud... Gavin's point in the latest 'state of Bitcoin' talk is valid: someone can do a long-con, build up a reputation and then watch the world burn.
What personally excites me is thinking of ways to contractually protect users from fraud using a combination of multisig, arbitration voting pools, surety/good performance bonds and other stuff people haven't though of yet. I don't think there will be a silver bullet, but a combination of measures that a user will use to evaluate risk.

I have a great deal of respect and admiration for Amir. His contributions are legendary, and his rhetoric is the stuff of legends.
That being said, I think he's incorrect about this topic. Let's examine the arguments:


- Gavin Andresen suggested increasing the block limit.  
- Gavin works for the Bitcoin Foundation.  
- The Bitcoin Foundation is evil and works with big corporations.  
- Therefore, Gavin is compromised because he is paid by them.  
- Therefore, increasing the block size is bad.
This is an *ad hominem* logical fallacy.  


Well, let us examine what Satoshi wrote in his whitepaper:  
- 1st sentence in the whitepaper: "A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."  
- In the Introduction, Satoshi describing the drawbacks to the current payment system (i.e. a motivating factor for the creation of Bitcoin): "... The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for **small casual transactions**... "   
Arguably, the value of the Bitcoin blockchain for non-payment purposes (as opposed to the Dogecoin blockchain or some other altcoin blockchain) is derived from the value the majority ascribe to it for payments.


Let's take a look at that. There are approximately 6 blocks per hour, or 144 blocks per day. The amount of transaction fees per day is ~$5,000 USD. This means a single block collects ~$35 using the figures I used (rounding up). At the moment, there are roughly 500 transactions per block. Now, does anyone want to compare the the accumulated bank fees in making 500 international payments via a bank? Take a local bank near me, [these are their fees for international money transfers]( If you didn't click the link, it's roughly $30 **per transfer**.
Bitcoin is a payments innovation, and a hell of a lot cheaper than the legacy banking system. Amir's statement is misleading.




This argument is largely based on the assumption that Moore's law will not allow us to catch up to the increasing HDD, RAM and bandwidth requirements of the blockchain. As a result, fewer people will run full nodes and the mining centralisation risk will increase.
Honestly I can't comment on how likely this scenario is. However, experience suggests to me that these requirements will be trivial given future hardware and network innovations. Also, the vast majority of individuals who own Bitcoin do not run full nodes anyway... we arguably may be living in this centralisation risk reality at present.


While this is certainly possible, without question the original vision of Bitcoin was to enable direct peer-to-peer transfers without having to go through this process. I'm also concerned that there is a centralisation risk in payments using this approach, where transaction fees are so high that **access** to these *settlement bitcoin payments* may be centralised.
In my view, a larger blockchain promotes both the poorest and wealthiest man a relatively equal opportunity to transfer wealth, without transaction fees being prohibitively expensive.

I think one of the things I'm personally excited about is that listing on *OpenBazaar* doesn't mean that potential buyers can only view your product on OB. Listings are simply *Ricardian Contracts*, which can be hosted on a website, emailed, linked to in a forum... heck, even included in your eBay description section (or a link to it). These contracts can be downloaded (very, very small: ~4 kb file) and imported into the OB client, which will take it from there.

3. Currency
4. Loans
5. Securities (i.e stocks/shares etc)
6. Intelligence
7. Prediction
8. Crowdfunding
9. Insurance
10. Other (unknown unknowns)

Took me a while to see his point because there was a lot of 'it's not fair' nonsense sprinkled throughout the argument. His and Dan's point remain valid: SHA256 as a POW makes the Bitcoin network vulnerable from a centralisation POV... while scrypt (or derivations thereof) may ostensibly fix it (I don't think it does fully), it makes Bitcoin more vulnerable to a 51% attack. Is the latter threat a reasonable concern... I'm not sure, probably yes. 
At the end of the day, sticking with SHA256 until we have a problem is the best course of action in my view.

Bitcoin isn't a better Western Uunion or Visa card. The roots of Bitcoin's origins are from the Cypherpunk Mailing List, people like Tim May spoke about what crypto-currencies could do and how they would be used to bypass the State as a part of an overall strategy to disintermediate the State from every sphere of our economic and personal lives.
The fact that Satoshi discussed Bitcoin in its infancy within these cypherpunk circles is a strong indication of his original intention.

Yes that's right. So if you knew that Alice was going to send you a transaction, you'd have to scan the blockchain for all transactions where the OP_RETURN = P (Alice)
You would then download those transactions and attempt to decrypt them using your private key (d). This doesn't need to happen online as far as I understand, as you will obtain a private key (as in a BTC private key; that is where H comes in - something I personally don't full know all the details yet) from the decrypted Q1 that you can import/sweep into your wallet at a later point.
I don't think you're any less secure than sending Bitcoins to normally via the client... if someone has hacked into your laptop, you're already pickled.

I can answer some of those questions:


We're using *Ricardian contracts* to authenticate and validate trades between individuals on *OpenBazaar*: 


You can encrypt a contract using the recipient's public key to preserve your privacy. If there is a MiTM attack, any modifications to the contract will be immediately detectable by the recipient when they automatically (the client) performs a check of the digital signature that is found in every contract. The client *should* also automatically check to see if the public key included in contract matches the known public key of the nym who is supposed to have sent it.
There's probably also more encryption layered on top of this, but I'll let the other guys address this.


As a long as funds end up in the multisig address, it doesn't matter how they got there.
Edit: There's nothing stopping you for using BitMessage as a means of distributing OB Ricardian contracts similar to how Open Transactions [proposed for their system](

It is difficult for me to tell given the absence of any sort of documentation or screenshots. I applaud the effort to create more decentralised marketplaces.
From what I can tell these are some of the key differences:
1. OpenBazaar will use [Ricardian contracts]( to represent goods, services etc
  - You can see what we're planning [here](
2. We will use a single multisignature address, not three... plus we will support voting pools
3. OpenBazaar will have a marketplace for notary (signing) and arbitration services... Pamela Morgan explains [why this is important](

The network is decentralised, but unlike music or movies, individual nodes are not sharing the same data. Specifically, individual nodes are not selling the same items or hosting the contracts of other peers on their nodes. So while the network itself is censorship-resistant, individual nodes and their items can be targeted. 
So while a movie shared by 1000 peers will still be available if a single person in the swarm is knocked out, a contract can only made by a single person. Making the contracts censorship-resistant by distributing them between multiple peers is a waste of time if the actual person with control of the key has been censored. 
While we'll introduce features like 'peer contract hosting' in the future potentially, at the end of the day only 1 signing key (representing the node on the network) can be used to authorise trades in conjunction with the PGP key (which can be shared between multiple nodes). 
It's sensational to claim that OpenBazaar isn't decentralised, but it's a disingenuous characterisation of the network. It's like saying that Bitcoin isn't decentralised because multiple peers don't control the same private key.

This is up to participants but we predict *probably* not unless they are called upon to resolve a dispute. However, well-trusted arbiters that don't resolve disputes still need to triple-sign contracts for potential hundreds of parties a day, so it's possible that they may charge the equivalent of a miner's fee. The most important part: there is an open market for arbiters.


Yes. At the moment, we are planning to implement:
1. Proof of burn pseudonyms (essentially ascribing value/capital to your identity)

Great question. Theoretically the answer is **yes**. As we're using [Ricardian Contracts]( to manage all trade over *OpenBazaar*, this should allows bots and distributed autonomous/consensus organisations to automatically:
1. Write contracts
2. Digitally sign and issue them on OB
3. Algorithmically search and accept contracts that fit certain parameters (i.e. look for contracts for french cats on sale by pseudonyms with a reputation level &gt; x, at a price lower than y etc)
*Ricardian contracts* support bots/auto-bots as the parameters of the contract are stored in application-parsable data fields within an XML or JSON file, which also happens to be human readable. Although, we are on a crusade or sorts to ensure that the end-user won't see the raw contract format, but rather the data wrapped in an eBay style interface so that they would be unaware (unless they want to be) of the raw contract format.
For an example, I'll refer you to an article that's a WIP:

Another research scientist here.
I'm a little surprised at some of the negative responses here. Some of them are made out of pure ignorance of the fact that the success rate of major funding bodies is less than 20%, and that good science gets unfunded **all the time**. Job security in research beyond 1-3 years is practically non-existent. Also most folks don't know that the host institution can take &gt;15% of the funding awarded to researchers in overhead/administrative costs (some of it worthwhile, others not so much). Frankly I'm surprised more researchers haven't made similar appeals sooner.
Furthermore, this group has been publishing in the top-tier journals repeatedly (well done!) so I don't think you need to worry about them being scammers.
To address the more valid criticisms:  
* Bitcoin will change how research will be funded; it will be come more decentralized and cross global boundaries  
* It is unlikely that Bitcoin will replace major funding sources at this stage, but what Bitcoin can fund are critical things like equipment purchases, and consumable costs which *sometimes* fall by the wayside in terms of funding (majority of funding goes directly to salaries unless the grant specifies otherwise)  
* Since Bitcoin crowd-sourcing for research is inevitable, instead of complaining how there isn't any sort of peer review in place (**which is a valid criticism, and absolutely necessary**), why don't people actually go and do something about it?
Here is a quick suggestion:
 Peer-reviewed crowd-funding
1. Start a website called peer-reviewed crowd-funding, appeal for fellow reddit-bitcoin-scientists to register as peer-reviewers and editors (submit their CV, PhD holder for at least 3-5 years etc, state expertise)
2. Allow other scientists to submit their funding proposals, which must specifically indicate **what the want to fund** rather than just generic funding to cure cancer (that crap won't fly).
  - This can be as simple as requesting funding for a $10,000 microscope objective, 1/3 of a PhD student's salary, full proposals
  - This can be further developed, just assume we have a set of reasonable guidelines
3. *Editors* do the 1-pass review of applications, then assign proposals to 2 peer-reviewers
4. 2 peer-reviewers examine the proposal and vote yes/no as to whether to publish the proposal (consensus required)
5. Successful proposals are posted to the crowd-funding page, with the funds controlled by a multi-signature bitcoin address (3-of-3)
6. Once the funding target is hit, the funds can be released to purchase the intended item and **only** the intended item, requiring the signatures of the two peer-reviewers who can ensure that the funds are being spent on the proposed item (3-of-3: 2 reviewers + research scientist applicant)
7. Requirement that any research resulting from this funding is submitted to open access journals and acknowledgement of the service in the journal articles
8. Keep a running tally of funded projects and outcomes for each user profile
This is just a primer for how crowd-funded research could work better.
tl;dr - Stop complaining, build something better to fund the research that needs to be funded.

Hey walden42,
We came up with a concept called a 'negotiator node', which would essentially run 24/7 and can host your contract and take orders on your behalf (subject to your final digital signature). This will be especially important for auctions, which we aim to develop in earnest after beta in time for RC1.
I suggest that folks do what I do, which is install and run OB on a VPS server. The resources required are much smaller compared to something like bitcoind, and it's easy to access from any location in the world. Of course that comes with security drawbacks, but balance it according to your preference.
We'll put up some tutorials for installation and running OB shortly.

So my day job is a cancer researcher and my first reaction was to look up Dr Isaac Yonemoto in Pubmed and also the literature on '9DS' or 9-deoxysibiromycin. Dr Yonemoto has published an OpenAccess research article in ACS Chemical Biology here:  
- **Paper:**   
- **Supplementary data:** 


This figure was particularly nice: 
- ACS Biology has an impact factor of 5.356 and is a respectable journal. I haven't examined the paper carefully so I won't make any comments as to the quality of the paper.
- In the past 5 years, Dr Yonemoto has had 10 publications, one of them as a co-author in PNAS (yes, that's the actual acronym of a prestigious journal, impact factor ~9).
The molecule they are investigating '9-deoxysibiromycin' is an analog of sibiromycin.  
- A pubmed search on 9-deoxysibiromycin fails to yield any other research than Dr Yonemoto's 2013 paper (abstract above) (Edit: which is not a red flag)  
- A pubmed search on sibiromycin yields an interesting OpenAccess review paper for those who want to delve into the dark arts of pyrrolobenzodiazepines: [Biosynthesis, Synthesis and Biological Activities of Pyrrolobenzodiazepines](
My own thoughts on this project are that this is an interesting project worth further study. However, I feel there is not enough *in vitro* data, let alone *in vivo* data, on the effects of 9DS on normal healthy cells and in comparison to other anti-cancer agents. Therefore, it is hard for me to judge whether it is worth investing/developing an easier way to synthesize this compound without this crucial bit of data. I can understand this project from the point of view that they want an easier way to batch produce more 9DS to obtain that data.... if so, I'd like to know what collaborations they have lined up to do that, given that their lab's expertise appears to be focused on synthesis **and** if/why they can't synthesize enough to obtain that preliminary data.

Hope this isn't a repost, but this was an interesting journal article recently published that could use a bit of public review.
 Abstract
A Bitcoin wallet is a set of private keys known to a user and which allow that user to spend any Bitcoin associated with those keys. In a _hierarchical deterministic (HD)_ wallet, child private keys are generated pseudorandomly from a master private key, and the corresponding child public keys can be generated by anyone with knowledge of the master public key. These wallets have several interesting applications including Internet retail, trustless audit, and a treasurer allocating funds among departments. A specification of HD wallets has even been accepted as Bitcoin standard BIP32. Unfortunately, in all existing HD wallets—including BIP32 wallets—an attacker can easily recover the master private key given the master public key and any child private key. This vulnerability precludes use cases such as a combined treasurer-auditor, and some in the Bitcoin community have suspected that this vulnerability cannot be avoided.We propose a new HD wallet that is not subject to this vulnerability.Our HD wallet can tolerate the leakage of up to _m_ private keys with a master public key size of _O(m)_. We prove that breaking our HD wallet is at least as hard as the so-called “one more” discrete logarithm problem.

Multisignature escrow address created by merchant, buyer and notary (pre-selected by the buyer and notarybtonact as the escrow agent).
At the moment we have primitive escrow selection options as we have a ton of other stuff to code. We're aiming for a robust notary selection process by beta 3.0 (end of October).
In the event of a dispute the merchant and buyer have some options depending on how they selected their notary:
1. If they selected a notary that acts as an arbiter, then this person will judge your dispute and make the best call based on the evidence that he accepts
2. If the notary is just a notary then the merchant and buyer select an arbiter to judge the dispute.
Selection of a notary and/or arbiter will take place via an arbitration market we have yet to build (beta 3.0) where arbiters can advertise their services based on precedents they have established which will, in effect, create their own legal system. So the arbitration market will be a polycentric law shopping center. We expect arbiters to specialise in time in certain types of disputes etc. 
If an arbiter that is not the notary is selected (which is something we recommend for several reasons I've written elsewhere... Still it's up to you), the notary will execute the judgment of the arbiter along with the winning party (ie sign a transaction releasing funds from the escrow address to the winning party). 
Sprinkle some reputation metrics, the ability for other arbiters to fork popular legal systems, and maybe even an appeals system, and we hope to create something truly cool: a polycentric law market.

It would theoretically support any coin you want to trade in, as long as the currency of choice is specified in the contract and both parties have signed to agree. Ultimately I think you'll have to find an arbiter that is prepared to accept altcoins as payment with multisig capability.

OpenBazaar dev here:
We have no control what individuals will choose to sell in their own computers. However, I seriously doubt that people will use OB to create their own SRs. The reason for this is that centralised dark markets appeal to buyer and sellers of illicit goods as their personal risk is disintermediated by the exchange. 
With OpenBazaar, or similar peer to peer markets, individual nodes will be exposed and responsible for their own OPSEC. Law enforcement will have the opportunity to go directly after nodes that are advertising illicit goods, rather than just the middle men like the SR, and chances are that most nodes selling illicit goods will fail (due to stupidity or incompetence) in any attempts to anonymise themselves in the face of government resources. 
More importantly, we're not building OB to replace the SR or facilitate the sale of illicit goods. Individuals will be responsible for what they buy and sell. We're in this to create a market platform to revolutionise ecommerce, make it more secure, eliminate fees, and create a thriving free market for goods and services using Bitcoin. We're in this to increase the utility of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange (the only thing that gives other applications of the blockchain any value). 
@_date: 2016-03-07 01:55:27
I think this is a good question, and I want to take the time to answer this and a related question wrt reputation:
There are two phases to getting moderated transactions and reputation to work in OpenBazaar:
1. Make it work technically
2. Make it work with humans
Both moderated transactions and reputation data work on a technical basis. We're optimising both prior to mainnet launch. 
Making it work with humans is a UI/UX and trust challenge. On the UI/UX, I think we've accomplished that and will always optimize to make it the best it can be. 
The trust challenge is incredibly important. Ideas like vetting Moderators and filtering out ratings to calculate a meaningful reputation score are some of the things that OB1 the company is seriously thinking about, but it's an open field for other players to enter.
tl;dr = Working on it :P

OpenBazaar dev here:
If you use OB for dark/grey market stuff, you risk directly exposing your IP address to law enforcement (remember this is a BitTorrent style p2p network), unlike like centralised markets where the major/prominent target is the exchange itself and the risk to suppliers/buyers is largely disintermediated. In short, you have to either be stupid or have incredible opsec to try it... either way, we condemn any attempt to use OB for illicit/immoral purposes in the **strongest possible terms**.

Perhaps, but consider that the ROI isn't high enough for busting people who are file sharing copyright music. What I mean is taking down 10000 people sharing 'Shake it off'  by Taylor Swift is not as tempting as taking down 10000 people selling drugs. Downloading or distributing mp3s cannot really be compared to selling drugs in the eyes of law enforcement (ie war on drugs).

He didn't have to factor in ASICs or mining pools as he already accepted the premise that mining nodes would probably be run in data-centers rather than everyone's computer.
He also considered that running a full node would be an economic cost that businesses are incentivised to pay for if accepting Bitcoin for payments... A cost that incidentally piggybacks off existing requirements of most businessea (a computer, good internet connection). 
Lastly Satoshi envisioned that the majority of nodes would be SPV clients.

Nice presentation, I enjoyed watching it. The only thing I would say at this point is that the notary doesn't receive the funds in escrow and is not a middleman per say.

This isn't the 'actual launch'. This is the testnet launch to help us stomp out all the bugs before people use real money for commerce, which is the responsible thing to do. People are excited about OpenBazaar, and so are we, but I agree that there's too much hype around Bitcoin-related projects.

I tend to think that a good payment hub would need to be well capitalized in order to form payment circuits between buyers and sellers... which is something that a venture-backed firm can commit resources to. Plus we can bundle that with other services.
KYC/AML will theoretically be the concern of every payment hub in the LN.

TBH, if Bitcoin does end up leaning on Layer 2 systems like the LN, it makes OB1's profit model a bit simpler. We can become a payment hub to facilitate payment channels between buyers and sellers. That's fine, and we'll look into that whatever the outcome of the block size debate is.
I, like many others, think that the LN is really promising, but skeptical of messianic properties given that it hasn't been released yet. LN has to pass both technical and consumer tests of usability. 
If the LN fails to be a mainstream consumer success, and the block size limit isn't raised, then OpenBazaar will probably have to consider opening the platform to other payment systems. We really believe in Bitcoin. But when you consider that Alipay clears 196 escrow tx/s, if OpenBazaar managed to achieve even 1 escrow tx/s, we'd fill blocks up by a third. 
Btw this is my own view, I'm not speaking on behalf of the OpenBazaar development team or OB1.
@_date: 2016-03-16 22:46:57
Let me clear some of that up:
1. Anyone could technically sell drugs, but as Tor and I2P aren't implemented into the networking backend, your IP address will be exposed. 
2. It's not trivial to add Tor or I2P. Tor for example uses TCP, which doesn't work for OpenBazaar as it uses UDP. This is why I2P is theoretically a better fit. 
3. There are some people working on a couple of tricks to get Tor or I2P working with OpenBazaar. We'll look and test any PRs sent our way. For the development team though, it isn't our immediate priority as there are half a dozen things we need to get working on the clearnet first before the mainnet release. It really is a matter of limited resources, time, and priorities.

On the contrary, I considered double-spend relaying + FSSRBF to be better approaches to increase awareness of DS attacks and 'unstick' transactions in good faith.

Peter Todd... what to say.
The purpose of the blockchain is to **prevent** double-spending. So what does he do? He creates a tool to trivially launch that attack that doesn't operate on good faith. What do I mean by that? Well ideally you'd want to double-spend transactions that 'get stuck', without changing the destination of those funds. It may be challenging, but no... instead Peter Todd introduces opt-in RBF so that a double-spend transaction can **change** the destination of those funds, thereby equipping any _script kiddie_ with a trivial way to launch the type of fraud attack he just demonstrated.
Why? Because he doesn't want you, the user, using zero confirmation transactions. Instead of enhancing mechanisms to prevent malicious double-spend attacks, he empowers and encourages them. 
Sure Coinbase should have known better since opt-in RBF was pushed, and they probably won't make that mistake again (hopefully). But the real question is how many other people are going to be defrauded as a result of this man's actions?

I don't think Peter Todd appreciates just how advanced coin tracking and de-pseudonymisation is in Bitcoin... and if he does, then his recommendation is puzzling at best, and a cause for suspicion at worst. 
Voting with your coins is painting a huge target on your back and undermines the fungibility of Bitcoin, the very thing he claims to want to prevent. And even if a third party couldn't associate your meatspace identity with the coins you use to vote, you've tainted your coins with a political opinion. The political opinion may not be over nation state issues, but it is a political opinion nonetheless. Miners with the opposing political opinion can target these coins for retribution in a number of ways, including the very type blacklisting the Peter claims to be trying to prevent. 
Imagine an influential group of corrupt miners targeting the 'yes' or 'no' votes from addresses in a controversial HF coin vote. These miners can exclude transactions moving these coins from being accepted into blocks, or at the very least delay them and/or force these coin-holders to pay higher fees.
Peter may not have signed up to create Paypal 2.0, but I certainly didn't sign-up for Bitcoin to become a proof-of-stake network.

Of course it makes you make fewer on-chain transactions, but this is a totally irrelevant point. Whether there are fewer or more on-chain transactions after the LN is deployed doesn't change the fact that 'opening and closing a channel' has a price, and that price is the on-chain transaction fee. 
Moreover, Bitcoin Core have been very clear that their objective is to create a fee market, which means elevated transaction fees to cover the marginal costs of mining blocks. So put 2 and 2 together and you have a reasonable expectation of transaction fees being much higher than they are (even after segwit), with no real ceiling, which prices people out of the LN. 


The next major release of OpenBazaar will have a wallet based off lnd (written in Go by Poon and co's team), which means we have a foothold into the lightning network. We have been figuring out how the LN will work in OpenBazaar, and just because you haven't participated in these discussions doesn't mean they haven't happened. But we did mention this in our roadmap published several weeks ago, which I recommend you check out. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:08:59
We're currently working on 2.0 of OpenBazaar, which will be written in Go and not Python... which means, among other things, the installer should be far more reliable &amp; you won't need to run a node 24/7 to have your listings accessible by the rest of the network.

I was referring to the fact that the non-segwit utxo is still spendable (and grow) if segwit is adopted... and this utxo is still vulnerable to malleability and quadratic signature hashing. This creates a fungibility problem with Bitcoin, and can **potentially** be used as an excuse to burn these outputs by a certain block to 'fix the problem'.

Yeah I agree, seems like **the** way to bootstrap to processing the world's transactions. The ideal scenario is if they end up being cheaper than on-chain transactions and centralized hubs aren't a problem for privacy given the nature of the transaction. That said, on-chain transactions still represent a core freedom that Bitcoin empowers to users to directly transfer _value_ from one person to another.
 &gt; The original design for lightning may have required a hard fork to support the entire worlds population transacting with bitcoin.
That should be the goal, but I hear your overall point. Nevertheless, none of these are ready for prime-time now, yet folks keep throwing LNs out there like they're ready and we're just not using them.

1. There is a tendency for the US dollar to rise when equities and commodities are in a huge sell off.
2. The reason for the rise in the US dollar (despite a long term depreciation due to the expansion of money and credit is insane) is that it is classically seen as an investor safe haven (it's a very liquid asset).
3. The US dollar rising against other currencies becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and causes more to pile in... this puts pressure on Bitcoin to drop down due to the strength of the dollar against other currencies.
4. As the price of Bitcoin goes down, anyone who was margin lending may get squeezed out, _if_ their margin call is higher than where the price sinks to.
5. If people are margin called, they have to sell their Bitcoin.
This is in addition to anything that's happening with Bitfinex.

Actually I'd argue that is wasn't. He submitted code to raise the block size limit for Core and wanted the comments for the PR to be strictly code related. Given how controversial the block size debate is, he wanted the merits of the block size to take place on the mailing list rather than have it spill over to code discussions.
This is perfectly reasonable.

Lightning networks are not ready to offload any significant portion of the transaction load, and **will require a hardfork** to increase the block size to do that anyway. If you want the chance at a lightning network, switch to Bitcoin XT.
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:20:36
Bitcoin XT represents a vote for a change in the core development team, not necessarily for bigger blocks.
Is Jeff's proposal better than Gavin's? I don't know. But Bitcoin Core have chosen not to implement it yet, and show no indication that it is a priority for them. Perhaps XT will prompt them to take action towards raising the block size, via whatever proposal they see fit, or they risk being out of a job.

You have zero idea of what you're talking about. So let me clear it up for anyone who may be reading this. 
Passcards, or Blockchain ID (as it will now be known), is an open decentralized protocol for creating cryptographic identities and registering them via the blockchain. They are the best protocol in this space for this purpose.  Onename is just one or many gateways for registering a Blockchain ID. 
In OpenBazaar, the use of Blockchain IDs are completely voluntary.

I think it's reasonable to assume a pendulum effect. The LN will offload some off-chain tx volume initially, but blocks will eventually fill up again (if for no other reason than more people opening/closing LN channels!) and we'll resume the trend of escalating on-chain transaction fees.
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:46:17
drwasho here; I'm core dev of OpenBazaar &amp; co-founder of OB1. If anyone is interested, I want to clear up the following:


Our last venture capital round was a total of $5M that was led by OMERS, and it was joined by Andreessen-Horowitz (A16Z), USV, BlueYard Capital, DCG and yes Bitmain. So no, we didn't receive $5M from Bitmain, and they weren't even our lead investors.
If having Bitmain as one of our investors makes you guilty by association, then please take a good long look at Blockstream's [investors]( and decide if you want to judge them by the same yardstick. Personally, I hate it when people rail on Blockstream as an AXA conspiracy or similar BS; everyone also loves to hate on DCG, yet Blockstream took money from them just like OB1 did.


If they meant we plan to sell a token in an ICO or in a SAFT, then this is dead wrong. We are planning to give away tokens so that you can use them for the decentralised advertising/affiliate system we're working on in OpenBazaar. You don't have to use the token, and the protocol works just fine without it by design. This type of token can't be deployed on top of Bitcoin due to scripting language limitations, and the sidechain/drivechain ecosystem isn't mature enough in our opinion.


We applaud bisq for their journey; just like Blockstream or Lightning Labs, we chose the venture capital route. Also, OpenBazaar has a 5-year track record with Bitcoin too, and you can purchase goods and services with Bitcoin today just like you could 5 years ago. It won't be long before you'll be able to do it with the LN too.
@_date: 2016-02-13 21:43:35
What we have created so far is the data layer. What will be open to third party developers (and our own efforts) will be filtering that data to get a more accurate sense of what the rating is.
For example, you could calculate the rating by only counting ratings from nodes with a Blockchain ID. Or you could deploy a Web of trust layer to weigh ratings based on their proximity to you in the graph.

Assuming you can open the channels in the first place and have capitalised them sufficiently? 
@_date: 2016-02-24 08:34:23
Let's be precise. It does scale on-chain, it's just that a majority of developers who have contributed to Core do not like what Bitcoin **may** look like if that happens. 
The fact that the blockchain is relatively inefficient compared to centralized solutions is irrelevant given the benefits we extract from the protocol. And it's certainly not the case that folks who believe like I do are against layer 2 solutions. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 00:28:53
Bitcoin Core isn't alarmed by this, and they won't be alarmed by this... it's actually part of their design.
They fundamentally believe a _fee market_ is necessary to pay for the security of the network, which means blocks need to full in order for transactions to be caught in a bidding war (in terms of fees) to be cleared from the mempool into the blockchain.
Bitcoin Core's reluctance to increase the block size isn't derived primarily from decentralization concerns, but their eagerness to see the emergence of a fee market. 
They have ruled-out paying for the security of the network by transaction volume with smaller fees. Overall this means that if the miners decide to stick with Core, the economic properties of Bitcoin that you're used to will be radically changed. Little by little, transactions will be priced out of the blockchain transforming Bitcoin from e-cash to a settlement system.
I've said this in other places, but I view this as the real *hard fork* of Bitcoin, not some token change in the block size limit.

The LN is under development, I'm excited and look forward to its release. 
That said, as a general rule it's unwise to make protocol changes to Bitcoin based on an unreleased and untested protocol. It's not just the technical challenges either, the LN needs to achieve product-market fit with consumers.
@_date: 2016-02-15 02:48:35


Classic, as it has been coded and deployed, is only an increase in 2 MB. This **necessarily** means that a segwit would need to be deployed as a soft fork or hard fork after the 2 MB hard fork.
The compromise for Classic is that they would stop the attempted hard fork now, delaying it until you have a unified hard fork attempt in cooperation with Core, incorporating the 2 MB increase with segwit.


9-12 month hard fork deployment of a 2 MB + segwit packaged deal is way too generous, especially if you have Core and Classic uniting behind the effort. Miners, exchanges, wallet providers and developers are not going to wake up tomorrow one morning and be suddenly surprised by such a hard fork.
Also your estimation of segwit's impact on relieving the transaction capacity in such a short time **is a guess**. Besides, the purpose of segwit is not to primarily relieve transaction capacity, it is to solve tx malleability and deploy other awesome features we all would like to see. 
An increase in the block size is a direct and immediate increase in the transaction capacity once it is rolled-out. Adam Back himself suggested it in August **last year**.

Theoretically only a Vendor can fake a rating using a sockpuppet buyer. This is not ideal, but at the same time not too different from existing platforms. We're not going to settle on this though, we have a couple of ideas left to roll-out after the initial v1 release. 
A Buyer cannot leave a fake rating of a Vendor without transacting with them, based on the schema we're using.

Top features:
1. **Offline stores.** Your store data is distributed on the network. You can turn off the app and other users can still view your listings.  
2. **Offline orders.** Users can place orders for your listings even if you're offline; funds can be sweeped back if a vendor is not responsive.  
3. **Item and shipping options**. Add item options and variants, and shipping options for countries or groups of countries.  
4. **Third party search.** Connect to a variety of third party search engines, some of which work over Tor. This is open, so you can make your own and other users can connect to it.  
5. **Tor.** can run your node exclusively on Tor or in dual-stack mode (ie nodes on and off Tor).  
6. **Bitcoin w/ segwit.**  Transactions are done using segwit, simple as that.
Please help us test and send us feedback for how we can improve the network.

OpenBazaar developer here. 
We have a pretty cool idea of how to do it. Essentially the merchant writes an unsigned *tx* sending a trivial amount of Bitcoin to themselves. The bidders submit their offers by appending another input into the tx to the value of the item, sending funds to the 2-of-3 escrow address (buyer seller, notary), and signs it. 
At the end of the bidding period, the merchant picks the highest bid, signs the tx and broadcasts it. This means that only 1 bid can win. If the buyer spends that funds before this time, the tx will fail and the merchant just chooses the next highest bid until a tx goes through.

There was peak of 22,787 `OP_RETURN`containing transactions on the 13th of September. Assuming all 40 bytes were full (which they typically are not), this calculates out to be ~0.91 MB of extra metadata in the blockchain.

Chargebacks in retail is _precisely_ what we want to avoid... It means other people are in control of your money. 
If Bitcoin were to become global settlement network, instead of a peer to peer electronic cash network, the number of on-chain transactions to be processed per day needs to be in the **millions** (yes, even with the Lightning Network, you need to fund and settle balances on-chain). 
IMV, data-center mining is inevitable. If the block size doesn't drive that (and it hasn't historically), mining hardware and electricity costs will (historically has). The sooner we realise this, the sooner we can start to think about solutions to the challenges that Bitcoin will face in the future (and yes, side chains are one of those solutions, I'm not anti-Blockstream).

But there are other factors involved. By performing such an attack, they undermine (no pun intended) confidence in the security of the network, and thus ultimately the currency.

Preventing an increase in the blocksize only creates an elite group of users who can access that settlement system, as they are the only ones who will be able to afford the fees.

If after 30 minutes I see that transaction A hasn't been confirmed, the chances that I'll even make transactions B and C fall dramatically. Anyway, I won't nitpick your example, it's a valid scenario (albeit an unlikely one in my view). 


It seems to me that it is perfectly clear that it makes fraudulent attacks easier. If the outcome was to unstick transactions without changing the output to the original destination, I don't think you would have seen much backlash at all. The fact that the funds can be sent to another output altogether is low hanging fruit for scammers... maybe even easier than transaction malleability attacks. The technical bar to achieve such an attack has been lowered, while the knowledge required to detect such an attack is higher. 
*But let's see the empirical evidence speak for itself* over the next few months to see what kind of damage (or lack thereof) it does. This could all be a storm in a teacup, or not.
IMO it's an incredibly irresponsible gamble to take on the ecosystem (especially since there are other ways to achieve better outcomes without increasing the chances of a double-spend attack)... it's also consistent with an approach to undermine the use of Bitcoin for consumer/retail transactions, when you consider that the same key people in favor of RBF are also resisting an increase in the block size.

I share the sentiment... however there are a lot of private management structures that rely on voting schemes, and the blockchain could provide some solutions for some (not all) cases. For example, a board room filled with 12 people doesn't need a blockchain to count and verify votes. A shareholder meeting (consisting of hundreds of investors, if not thousands depending on the size of the company) may benefit from using the blockchain.

Could you please suggest a practical example where either regular consumers or financial institutions would encounter this sort of scenario?
If I'm using Bitcoin to purchase a good, those funds would only ever go to the Vendor, and if the transaction is stuck then FSS-RBF would suffice to 'unsticky' it.


Yes, that makes sense... but it does so at the expense of making fraudulent attacks significantly easier... this is a poor trade off.


It seems to me there are alternative patches that could have achieved this effect with undermining the use of Bitcoin as cash.

Yep, I don't disagree.

BitTorrent has managed to survive despite enormous pressure and various attacks. As described in the article, GUID generation is computationally expensive, which should slow down the types of attacks you suggest. 


A motivated and well-resourced attacker can cause problems for any network. So far both BitTorrent and Bitcoin have survived despite high profile opposition. Also it seems you don't understand how these networks work. The GUID can either be computationally expensive (like we designed) or not (like BitTorrent); either way the user needs a GUID. 


Yes it is, and I was referring to some technical events that occur when a Vendor chooses a Moderator(s) to work with, which would have distracted from the message of the article. 


This type of situation will always be difficult to resolve, and it's not specific to OpenBazaar but all ecommerce platforms. 
At least in OB, there is a marketplace for Moderators who can publish dispute resolution guides so both the Buyer and Vendor can take whatever steps necessary to maximise the chance of a dispute resolving in their favour. 


The point of a reputation system is to help you forecast whether a user will behave appropriately. 




Not really. Many people who say this don't appreciate how easy it is to give yourself fake ratings in centralised marketplaces. Moreover, you can pay $100 to get a bunch of fake reviews from India or South America. In these platforms, the source and destination of funds is veiled to the public and to some degree the platform. In short you will have zero indication whether someone is paying themselves for fake goods to have fake ratings. 
In Bitcoin, transaction analytics can score the likelihood of coins being reused as well as other metadata such as time it took to fund and payout an escrow address (if it happens in 1 hour when physical goods take a week or more to deliver, it's a red flag). None of this data is available to the public when credit cards are used. 


Multisignature escrow strongly mitigates exit scams. No one person can run off with the funds. 
However, there real risk is collusion between one party and a fake Moderator. This is why in the article I state that I expect Moderators to leverage their real world identities, at least initially. 


Name one reputation system that is resistant to Sybil attacks. There are none. There are only systems that try and make it as difficult and transparent as possible to perform an attack. 


I already addressed this above. 
It just seems your criticism is centred on that it's not a **perfect solution** against Sybil attacks or exit scams, without appreciating that there aren't any perfect solutions, or suggesting any better alternatives. And believe me, our door is open to thoughtful suggestions.
@_date: 2015-10-03 00:59:32
That's not what I'm saying, and I presume you've read my Scaling Bitcoin article that demonstrates that the size of blocks required for a robust settlement network with a competitive market share needs to be substantially larger than the estimated in the original paper.

Here's a quick Reddit update on OpenBazaar:
OpenBazaar is now split into a server daemon (what talks to the network, digital signatures, database etc) and a client built with electron (like Popcorn Time, Slack - what you interact with that talks to the server). 
Server part is finished and stable. We have a REST and WS API that kicks ass and will enable anyone to create their own UI or operate a node in the cloud if they want (tested this with Digital Ocean, works really nicely!). Optimising performance at this stage. 
The client is a major piece of work that is only partially complete. It's a complete redesign, built from the ground up. That's where our primary development effort is focused on right now. 
If anyone can contribute to the cause, not with money but development, we can push this out faster.

I like the story about what happened to eBay in China when Taobao (Alibaba group) was launched. 
Long story short, Taobao's 0% listing and transaction fees eroded eBay's 70% market share. 200 million dollars later and ebay had to surrender (they ended up buying a local ecommerce company, but Taobao still dominate). 
I'd like to see that effect happen on a global scale long term. 
For now though, I don't think we're competing with eBay etc. If you're a Vendor, I would encourage you to list on OpenBazaar *in addition to* whatever you're using now. We'll do our best to make tools easy for you to do that over the coming months. 
Not many vendors like ebay, but the reason they still use them is the traffic they bring. It's less about fees and more about eyeballs. Important thing to remember.

In fact they are unaware of trades they aren't called upon to resolve. 


FYI we changed the name of notaries to_Moderators_. We allow the mods to set their own fee structure, but we give them a tipping/tx as one of the possible fees. This could be 1% of the total value of the trade. I would encourage people to embrace the tipping as the mods need to have a persistent presence on the network and are there for you if anything goes wrong. 
The Moderator doesn't have to choose that fee model, and you don't have to choose that Moderator. 


Yeah, and there's an open market for Moderators, which is key.

If you think that the LN will make raising the block size unnecessary at all, or even by only a little, then yes it is unrealistic.

Bip70 is too limited in what you can accomplish as far as marketplaces are concerned. Ricardian Contracts are way more extensible and you can use them to accomplish multiple types of trades while achieving the same (and possibly better) security features of Bip70.
The python backend is for the networking side of things and the reference client we're building (HTML, JS, angular) is just that: a reference client. Which means you can build your own client in whatever language you prefer. Plus you can setup Web served OB stores, which is something we're very keen in developing. 
Lastly, unlike some would have you believe in this thread, we're not trying to do 1 million things at once, or trying to perfect just 1 more esoteric thing... We're working on 2 things:
1. Getting a kickass, robust p2p network that your grandma's crappy router can use. 
2. Redesigning the UI/UX of the reference client.

Numbering is irrelevant relative to the number working features. But so you know, we're number according to the **beta** version... They're not full release numbers. 


This has been working months and months ago, and is relatively trivial to code. This is not the cause of delays. 


See below. 




Ok, here's what you need to know. All of your suggestions **assume** a robust p2p network where nodes, even behind NATs, are able to communicate with each robustly. The p2p networking code is **hard to get right**. We've had to make significant changes to the original Dark Market design, then try and get ZeroMQ to cooperate, and now we've ripped it out altogether in favor of rUDP. Our current testing indicates that we've made significant improvements to the performance and robustness of the network. 
So while it seems we're caught up in esoteric tinkering with features (which don't take long to code), the reality is that the networking code (in all its unsexyness) needs to work first. 


This proof of concept you speak of was achieved a long time ago. The problems we rapidly encountered were network related as described above. Good news is that the fixes are being merged into the development branch.

Cart before the horse. OB isn't ready for prime time... If you can't install it, it's because we don't want someone like you to install and test it at this stage. 


P2P networks are **hard** to build... As in the networking side. Being able to overcome the limitations of your grandparent's crappy router or corporate NATs **is hard**. Without a robust network, nothing can be built on top of it. There are hundreds of front end developers for every 1 dev that is skilled at networking with some idea about DHT-based p2p.
We have new networking code getting ready to be merged that will see massive improvements. So don't give up on us. 
And yeah, we do this part time for free, but not without a cost... And the cost is time.

I believe it may be a forgone conclusion that eventually government regulations will be shaped so that Bitcoin miners need to declare the quantity of Bitcoin they have generated (for tax purposes) and personal details of the recipients they transfer those Bitcoins too. 
Bitcoin is only revolutionary and 'disruptive' if it circumvents traditional means of centralised control of money issuance and transfers. Government regulations will eventually specifically target the things that make Bitcoin disruptive. They now have an opportunity to grab Bitcoin by the jugular by clenching the miner's throats... I'll be surprised if they don't squeeze. 
That is why I find it particularly distasteful when I read of individuals welcoming government regulation of Bitcoin. 
How effective these regulations will be is a separate issue. Every time I read stories like these I pray that Open Transactions and Zerocoin hit the market asap.

I had the pleasure of knowing and interacting with Konrad Graf for almost 2 years. He has been unafraid to tackle some of the most complex and contentious topics out there with razor sharp praxeological clarity. I encourage all of you to set aside some time to read this through.
This is the introductory text:
"Below is the first public version of a new work I have just written on Bitcoin and monetary theory. It addresses in a more systematic way than I have before issues relating to the interpretation of the origins of Bitcoin in terms of the monetary regression theorem and the application of some central integral-theory principles to monetary theory.
Bitcoin has arisen as an entirely new and unexpected market phenomenon deserving of fresh treatments. Its arrival also provides opportunities to dig deeper into theoretical fundamentals themselves. While this work can be viewed as part of a much larger project in progress, I also have the sense that it can stand alone.
The title, On the origins of Bitcoin: Stages of monetary evolution, acknowledges the inspiration of the classic 1892 work, On the origins of money by Carl Menger, a landmark in the development of the market-evolution account of the origins of media of exchange and money. This “Austrian school” or “Vienna school” approach contrasts with what I dub the state-creatationism theory of the origin of money. It also contrasts with the tempting but unsatisfactory view that money is merely a “social illusion.”
In a nod to the software world out of which Bitcoin has arisen, I call it a first public beta, meaning that, while refinements are always possible and likely, I think the central intended functionality has been implemented. Revised versions and formats may follow."

My point is not to be too quick to judge him for this. Yes it's disappointing that it happened but it is understandable... Best response was to make cryptographic communication tools that don't have a single point of fail/exposure... So if a service provider was forced to turn over ALL information on their server, the Feds would see just everything encrypted.

I'm of the Austrian opinion that economics is a full science that falls under the category of praxeology (study of human action)... Which under methodological dualism makes economic laws discoverable by logical deduction and illustrated by empirical data, rather than by exclusive empirical study like the natural sciences.

For the lazy:
"Most clients on the network have a transaction pool in their memory. The same basically applies to miners: they just dump the top 500KB (or some other value) transactions into a block, sorted by transaction fee (descending, of course). When there aren't many transactions, maybe because of a series of block in a short amount of time, it will be confirmed anyway.
But to answer your actual question: yes, transactions (sort of) expire. When you send a transaction, it sends a tx frame to all connected peers. These peers store the transaction in their memory pools and tell all their connections that they have a new transaction. When those connections don't have it yet, they ask for it, and that's how a transaction spreads over the network.
At some point every node in the network will have the transaction in their memory pool, and at that point it will no longer be sent over the network. Now when a user restarts their client, the memory pool is wiped, and the transaction is deleted from that computer. (Plus a few other ways to delete transactions from the pool)
Because of that it's very unlikely for the transaction to be gone from the entire network, but in case it does happen: the reference client will automatically re-send the transaction every x hours(/minutes?) when it's still not confirmed.
Oh, and I forgot the most important part: transactions on Bitcoin (tx frames in the protocol) don't have a 'time' field, which means that transaction expiration can't be a feature of Bitcoin.
To summarize: yes, the transaction can expire, but that is really unlikely."
**tl;dr** - Yes they can expire, but unlikely they will. However, Bitcoins stuck in limbo is just as detrimental for merchants... so querying if the payment has a tx fee is a good layer to reduce the risk of delayed payments.
@_date: 2013-06-03 04:49:58


Yes that's true. Though while the regulatory framework around the exchanges is important, it is ultimately unimportant if there is still freedom to exchange goods/services directly for Bitcoins. It is my belief that as government fiat money undergoes competitive devaluation and capital controls come in, goods and services will be valued in Bitcoin without reference to the fiat exchange rate (maybe the reference will inverse). It is at this point that government will attempt to block these direct trades and it is this sort of regulation that may be the most damaging.


Agreed, the blockchain is beautiful.


I don't share that sentiment, but I think that's because we don't have matching political ideology :)

A change in the PoW is a big deal, requiring a hard fork as Andreas correctly explained. A change of that magnitude cannot occur by anything less than a crisis in my view. As i wrote in my tl;dr, the problem that Dan and Andreas describe is over blown IMO and I hope it doesn't snow ball into a hard fork (Gavin seems optimistic that no change will occur, plus the existence of Litecoin is a great alternative).
Also, most of discussion was largely Andreas arguing for a change in the PoW based on Dan Kaminski's comments at the conference and how the current system violates neutrality. There wasn't much of a balanced discussion, which is ok but it would have been nice to hear both views (at least for the uninitiated).


Many alt coins have been compromised by insufficient hashing power in the network. The higher the hashing power, the more confidence and robust the network is... I don't know what the minimum value is (the red line) for Bitcoin, and I don't think anyone wants to know the hard way. Therefore I welcome the additional hashing power of the asics.


There are 2 aspects to network robustness: 1) hashing power (difficulty) and 2) distribution (decentralization). 
Generally it is much easier to perform certain types of DS attacks on a highly decentralized network with a lower hashing difficulty than a less distributed network with a higher hashing difficulty.
Less decentralized networks are vulnerable to DDoS and collusion between miners. But these problems are less severe than DS vulnerabilities.
Plus CPU mining could end up as 1 botnet = 1 vote.
Anyway... It was a great episode and these challenging subjects need to be discussed more.

@_date: 2013-07-05 02:29:16
It appears that the entire 'crisis' is built upon the premise that only a few will ever afford ASIC mining rigs and that this small number of miners will either: 1) attempt a 51% DS attack, 2) be vulnerable to regulation, and/or 3) betrays Satoshi's vision of 1 CPU/vote.
Firstly, every second day there's news of new ASIC products (USB, rigs etc) that brings down the cost of these specialised mining units... I think its economically short sided to believe that ASICs will remain out of reach to most people due to price (Moore's law etc).
RE the other concerns:
1 - Why would miners perform a DS after investing capital in purchasing expensive mining rigs and sabotage their long-term ROI by undermining the integrity &amp; therefore the price of BTC? If anything (and as experience has shown) miners are keen to preserve BTC integrity over short term profits (eg March hard fork) for their own long-term self-interest.
2 - Do we really believe that governments around the world will ban the production and sale of ASICs? Assuming so, then everyone will go back to CPU/GPU mining... So I don't see that as a problem.
3 - Satoshi's vision was broadly decentralised mining rather than a strict 1 CPU/vote... Otherwise opponents to the current PoW should be consistent and propose a change so that it truly is 1 CPU/vote. On the point of decentralization, any change or improvement in the efficiency of BTC mining automatically centralizes hashing power to early adopters of he new technology. GPU miners did it to CPU miners, GPU miners were supplanted by PG** (forgot the acronym), which have now been replaced by ASICs. 
ASICs are enjoying an advantage and have created a profit opportunity that will slowly close with new players producing ASICs at cheaper prices, minimizing the profit advantage and decentralizing power simulatenously.
tl;dr - a change in the proof of work is a solution in search of a problem + economics teaches us that the 'problem' will be short lived.

I understand the sentiment behind alternatives to PoW in making coin generation available to everyone, instead of just a few that invest in the capital equipment. 
I wish them all the best of luck in their altcoin incarnations, but Bitcoin was very closely modelled off the principles of gold mining and real economic incentives that should be preserved... And it's part of the reason Bitcoin is successful today. 
I'm interested in new and innovative proof of X systems. Proof of gaming work is one, have any user play a game of minesweeper or something. Or if some scientific research like neural mapping (forgot the link) is integrated into the proof of work mechanism, that would be cool. Braincoin?

I didn't say it was irrelevant Vycid. My point has been that if 'Bitcoin + regulations' give us merely a better version of Paypal, then the project hasn't achieved much. 
But let's be clear about what we're talking about: there are regulations to neuter the Bitcoin protocol (which are highly unlikely to succeed) and then there are regulations to make the exchange of Bitcoins to government-fiat currency transparent and controlled (which is what the article is about).
The latter regulations are more of an annoyance and impediment to individuals who want to want to conduct business privately without the government watching or intruding (don't think this only applies to nefarious individuals breaking laws). Then there are more serious regulations that stop businesses from making direct exchanges of goods/services for Bitcoins, unless the Bitcoins are sourced from a chain with a government-approved tick. Under this scenario, the appeal of Bitcoin is significantly diminished.
And Bitcoin isn't truly anonymous... all transactions are easily traceable on the blockchain and the moment you exchange them for government fiat, someone has your Bitcoin address associated with your identity (more so with FinCEN regulations), which they can be compelled to surrender to the authorities. 
This is why I'm eagerly awaiting [Zerocoin]( and [Open Transactions]( as they overcome the current problems of traceability and anonymous exchanges. For me these projects complete, what I imagine to be, Satoshi's original vision.

The point I am trying to make is not that the Bitcoin protocol will protect you from being arrested... rather, the very nature of the protocol is highly censorship resistant.
You can't arrest Bitcoin anymore than you can arrest drugs if you aim to stop either thing. 
You can only try and arrest Bitcoin users to disincentivise participation in the network. If the war on drugs is anything to go by, arresting Bitcoin users will be no more effective at stopping Bitcoin than arresting drug addicts to try and stop drugs.

It stands to reason that if you MUST disclose addresses or a series of addresses with your profile, anyone can follow your spending history by simply examining the blockchain and cross-referencing against a list of addresses associated with individuals and merchants.
The beauty of a lack of regulation in this area is that you aren't compelled by the government to disclose your identity for any transaction (even to merchants, unless they request it... Which means you get to choose to do business with them). This is so important because of the public nature of the blockchain.

Bitcoin isn't legally considered money (despite the fact that it is) so I fail to understand how this cease and desist will stand up in court. Most of the discussion in the comments has focused on whether the foundation is technically a money transmitter without first questioning the premise of Bitcoin being legally considered as money to be transmitted. 
With E-gold it was a target for this sort of thing because constitutionally gold is money. This is not true for Bitcoin. 
The Bitcoin foundation doesn't run an exchange, it only facilitates the creation of 1 version of the client... And even that is not accurate as they only pay Gavin, who is just 1 (but major) developer of Bitcoin-qt. 
Or is there something in the law/precendent that I missed?

Didn't quite understand the modulus function example in the article. 23/5 is 4.6 but they wrote it was 4 remainder 3. 
What did I miss, or did they make a mistake? 
Edit:  The answer is here -

Thanks Edward. How's Russia?

Rest of the video is pretty good too. I hadn't heard about the concept of 'dead money' before... perhaps integrating property titles into the blockchain may help, although the problem seems to be getting opportunities to collateralize rather than issuing property titles.

Lol, why is there a picture of Konrad Graf? I mean he's written fantastic articles about Bitcoin, but not this one.

It's force versus choice, that's the heart of the issue.
I don't mind if I disclose my identity to a merchant, because I can take reasonable efforts to protect my identity for other transactions that are legal but private, where I don't want to disclose my ID even to a merchant.

'Overtake the government'... yeesh, Statists just don't get it.

Please don't let him get away with saying tgat gold has intrinsic value whereas Bitcoin does not. 
As an Austrian school economist, It's Peter should know that Menger, Mises and Rothbard repetitively taught than there is no such thing as intrinsic value... Subjective value is one of the key principles and insights of the Austrian school, and he ought to know better.

He must be brewing something strong on the inside.

Then it is merely a convenient payment system for government approved users.

Did you write that? It's beautiful.

I wrote 2 articles on the topic of fractional reserve banking (FRB) and BTC-FRB. I make the case that FRB isn't fraud, clarify the nature FRB contracts and describe how they could work in BTC (though I don't recommend it).

Que pregunta tienes?
@_date: 2013-07-11 22:07:03
Congrats Adam, huge win for you guys!
Question 1: Do you believe that the current proof of work algorithm should be modified? :D
Question 2: What do you see as bitcoin's biggest challenges technically, socially (ie adoption) and legally? How does the Foundation aim to help overcome those challenges.
Question 3: What are your thoughts on the integration of anonymising services into the protocol such as Zerocoin? Are there any features you'd like to see adopted into the protocol?
Question 4: How optimistic are you that Bitcoin can coexist with the dollar in the United States? At what point does the government dress a line the sand and attempt a full scale ban?
Question 5: What is the foundation doing (or plan to do) about promoting adoption of Bitcoin in the third world? 
That's all I can think of for now.

Can some independently vett this? Sounds awesome if it checks out.

In a technical sense Bitcoin is virtual (no argument there), but there is a sense that by saying 'virtual money' it's somehow the margarine of money, not quite real.
'Digital currency' covers the fact that Bitcoin exists on the peer-to-peer network.

I heard that Guido Hulsmann is against it, can anyone confirm that?

Awesome! What do you do that's bitcoin related?

"... the government regulates value... "
Not with Bitcoin. Exchanging Bitcoin for fiat is another story.

Nakamoto is too criminal to have a first name... at least it's not 'thermos'.
Australian Taxation Office response relating to Bitcoin:
"Broadly, the tax rules that apply to conventional commercial transactions also apply to transactions undertaken via the Internet or with emerging payment systems. 
Paying for goods and services with new types of payment tokens still means that the seller may need to account for GST or include the income in their business tax return.
The buyer may also need to keep records of the value of the purchase if it represents a business expense or if the purchase is an asset which may be subject to a capital gain or loss.
In relation to Bitcoin in particular, the ATO does have some work underway to monitor it, and other payment systems, as part of our normal monitoring of developments for which there may be tax consequences."

Looks like they may try and set it up on an altcoin. Open Transactions may be the way forward for anonymous Bitcoin exchanges. 
@_date: 2013-04-29 02:45:06
Free idea: create an exchange-escrow for in-game currencies and Bitcoin. Use the platform? 
@_date: 2013-05-22 02:45:29
I believe Bitcoins aren't apolitical... They're anti-political, they directly challenge the concept of central economic planning. 
I would like to have an optimistic hope that Bitcoins could bring economic unity between Israelis and Palestinians... Whereas political action has only done the opposite.

Compliance does not equal legitimacy... adoption does. You can have a 'compliant' protocol, but if no one uses it you have nothing.

Yeah I know it's not convenient for some phones, but there is some specific formatting that I just needed to use Scribd for. Surely PDF will work on your phone?
