Also know as the *"Look at that volume, we must get into that market and regulate the shit out of it, so we can take some nice fees!"*

Reminds me how my situation with the bank goes. Each 6 months I get an email telling me the interest will get lowered. At this point is about 1/2 the inflation...
ps: Meanwhile the credit interests for loans are up as never before. That's how you fuck a system up: lower saving's interest, raise credit intrest for loans.

Ukraine is in the shit. Wouldn't hope anything for that country, soon it will be torn into two and politics will fuck it up for the next 10 years.

So can we call the whole exchange market on crypto's to be just a fraud system?! It seems like it!

By the pure volume per country, the article should be fixed to:


This goes for altcoins as well. Non-asian traders and volume is the little fish!

This method is done in a lot of fraud crimes where they would even be listed as CEO's of companies and such...just to put the blame on them.

How the fuck is this different then the crappy IPO's some crypto coins do this days? 


Oh, they are a "fund" that will most likely be registered in one of Europe's tax heavens and be liable under no law. 
Yeah, good luck with that. Take it with a grain of salt and always invest max. 50% so you don't have to commit suicide down the line when they scam you.

Good! Can we already forget about MtGox and have the Bitcoin Foundation step in and either supports/helps MtGox or tells them to fuck off and cuts them down like the cancer they are right now for the bitcoin market?
It seems the Bitcoin Foundation does nothing, while *a part*, MtGox, poisens the market...

And ofc, we *always belive* people on the internet. Just look how many millionaires browse reddit each day, *they are just like us*!

inb4 they do the same in Europe. Since it's a way to circumvent the law in place that limits the ammount you can donate as a regular citizen or company.
It will only make the whole donations more shaddy and politics more corrupt!

Unregulated but given that the it's not immune, I would say, it's about fully, linked with what's going on the press/internet and the general mass-media, a statement or point of view from the Bitcoin Foundation could just do that.
Since MtGox has been doing just that, giving false statements that the withdraw's might resume, problem was fixed, but was not, the Bitcoin Foundation has every if all rights to give their view and warn potential new clients on what the state of MtGox is.
And if they came out and say "Guys, please stay away from MtGox" it will kill it very fast, instead of MtGox dieing slowly, like it is now, taking even more people with them and BTC market as well.
It's not about regulate, it's about voicing a formal opinion from the guys that made and sustain the BTC market as they have a stake in keeping it alive, rather then seeing it die!

A more better example is, buy objects/collectables of value in nieche domains and store them. This goes from anything like fine art to old cars, etc.., stuff that has a market for it and due to the market, limited supply and exquisite nature, only goes up in value over time.
The main issue with currency and even gold, silver and other assets it's the market is open for speculations, volume is high, so it's a more dynamic model. And in order to be very good in it you either need to speculate a lot or need to be a heavy inverstor to be able to move the market when you want it to do, for your own advantage.
 While for an old painting, the market is very static, once you have it, you have the only one and in theory and even more in real life, it can't go down in value.

Jokes on him, if you are a regular client, as in a citizen, you pay VAT on the product anyhow. If you are a company inside the EU you get it with no VAT. So this changes nothing, regardless what you pay, a regular citizen will pay the full price!
Since bitcoin is not labeled a currency in EU, that means it's a product and any product has VAT!

Maybe that's what the majority wants? By moderating in a way where you are deciding what posts should be up and delete others you are making it your version of subreddit then asking the viewers to share your own vision.
It's not how it works, yes you need to have some sort of anti-spam bot, but the community is the one that needs to sort out what topics are of value.

When it comes to fiscal crimes, prison time is useless. There should be a "program" to try to reimburse the damage, as in give back the ammount.
Else you could pull the biggest heist in history, think of a number, billions of dollars for example and still just be able to get life in prison, meaning like what, an averege of 40-50 years.

So give them what they want or make a subreddit with specific rules so people know it. Even better make a private subreddit so you can then approve the level of the topics and be an elitist circlejerk.
Ow, but then you will have just a fraction of web trafic and users to discuss things. Well, you can't have both of them: leeching the trafic from new users while keeping the subreddit fixed to what you as a moderator want without stating it in the rules.

Well if you understand how the european economy works, you must know that Cyprus was and still is a safe heaven and a piggy bank for a lot of EU companies and citizens.

Notice how they follow the same pattern as politics does, in the fair voting system. In the future there will be only 2 banks, one more evil then the other when it suits them, while doing backdeals on the side. Oh and the sometime 3rd, 4th that is just supported by one of the two to steal clients from the other one!

Maybe what is is saying is that a group of few amateurs are invested in BTC and not any "whales"...*cough* China!

This means that Bitcoin will be somewhat more stable in the future so the majority of the players will have to play on alt coins to earn them big profits of fluctuations.
And it's a fucking good deal, just look at all the altcoin markets after the BTC drop, it stagnated very hard while people were pulling their BTC to either panic sale or sale to reinvest in cheaper BTC. People forgot about alt coins and just focused on BTC.
Having one coin with a decent stable price means everyone wins:
* day traders will play in altcoin markers and the "boom" of number of coins will 
* miners can get a steady pay and even more decent if they are lucky and mine the good alt coin
* investors will look at btc as a way to deposit and keep their fiat or move it

Chill the fuck down.


Well bitcoin it's a nor a "real" currency, it's not tied and registered to a country and regulated by such. So a trade in bitcoin is a trade in barter (exchange), it's a product that as a value, that looks like a currency. 
Just like the platic coins you get at your local amusement park to go rides, it has no value apart from the two parties that recognize it's value.
So what they are saying is right, but it doesn't apply to bitcoin trade.

This. Also bitcoin can't fix Greece's situation unless they could pull of a 50%+1 attack and shift prices like they want it to go. In other EU countries that do not have euro yet the National Bank uses the exchange rate, national currency to foreign currency to "protect" the business internally.
