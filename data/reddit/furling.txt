This will happen as soon banks start to collapse during the next financial crisis, since it will be politically impossible to bail them out again.  
@_date: 2014-07-10 03:15:24
The idea is that banks wouldn't necessarily lend out all of the money, and even if they did, they should have enough shareholder equity as a buffer to satisfy withdrawals.

Which isn't a problem if they are allowed to fail -- as there could be no bailouts with BTC fractional reserve.

This is ever the problem, but using a hard currency would at least bring the problem out into the open -- as it would force the people and the government to prioritise spending and limit it to a level that can be financed through taxation and debt issued at market rates, rather than debt subsidised by magic.

The fact that you had to correct the mm-&gt;cm kinda illustrates the point though. Any unit you don't use day-to-day is unintuitive and becomes a hassle to convert. I feel like bits &amp; satoshis, should be the units people get introduced to, as it makes bitcoin seem like most other currencies.

Right, but the money itself isn't wealth, it is just a means to facilitate the exchange wealth, so there will always be some price at which people are willing to buy the food they need for tomorrow or a new phone, because it's not like you can ever run out of bitcoins.

If bitcoin succeeds it will throw a spanner in the works of the IMFs attempts to morph into a global central bank via the issuance of IDRs as the new reserve currency.

I really liked your article but I don't buy the deflation trap argument, deflation is a problem when you have debt based money because loans get defaulted on and fractional reserve banks have to either get wiped out (which I would be all for) and the debt purged, or bailed out which leads to inflation.
If you're holding on to bitcoins, that's not hoarding, that's saving. You are effectively investing in your future ability to consume, and the rate of return on your savings is by definition the risk free rate of return as decided by the market. Of course at the moment holding bitcoins is far from risk free so if they succeed people will be compensated for the massive risk they have taken by buying them today, but I assume you are talking about some point far in the future where bitcoins are the only currency?

I see this as akin to taking out a loan today in dollars to buy a new computer or new car. They depreciate faster than the currency (i.e. the currency rises in value relative to them). People still make and take the loans.
In your mortgage example, you would simply need additional collateral or a stelar credit history, etc. Loans will be harder harder to get than today.

So before debt based money (i.e. fractional reserve banking), I guess the "money" was pieces of gold. In that case if the rate at which gold is being discovered and dug up is greater than the rate of growth in economic output there will be inflation if it is lower there will be deflation. I don't see where the contradiction lies?

The problem with this is what happens if the price crashes massively while the difficulty is sky high -- the financial incentive to mine disappears and the next block might never come. So in a sense (because of all the ASICs) the network does now require a bunch of super powerful bitcoin miners.

That confusion comes from the fact that 'bit' has only just started being used though (over the last couple of months?). During the last bubble, the rough consensus was that mBTC is great and everyone should switch to mBTC. Since bubbles are when most new people jump on board, moving to µBTC ahead of time makes sense IMO. 
I just think that overloading the term 'bit' sounds cooler and is preferable to using a 'micro' prefix, which subconsciously makes small BTC holdings seem smaller. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 21:00:32
Yeah, but the government would have to acquire those BTC through taxation, which implies the consent of society (in a democracy). It's a very different prospect when you have to raise peoples' taxes to cover the bailout. Now maybe the bank is so important that people would be willing to pay out of pocket for the bailout - but I doubt this would be the case.

Only just reading this thread now, but I wanted to say that this is a really elegant argument (that I've never seen before). I'm surprised it doesn't get used more when people talk about deflation. 
When government debt is considered "risk free" because the central bank can always buy it, all they are doing is shifting the risk of default to a risk of future inflation. You can't really get around the market rate - it will eventually be imposed one way or another regardless of whether a currency is inflationary or deflationary.

I think she has some misunderstanding of what an exponential function is. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 05:54:57
Exactly, money is not wealth, it is an accounting system that facilitates the exchange of wealth. Obviously if you have a bank created debt based currency that is inflationary by design it must always inflate because deflation would lead to debt defaults and bank failures. 
This does not mean that if you had a different system, where the money created was not someone else's debt, that you wouldn't get the same growth. As deflation in this scenario does not have the same implications.

These "Bitcoin's monetary policy is wrong" arguments annoy the crap out of me. If you want to make an alt-coin with its supply linked to NGDP (and therefore also linked to a particular fiat currency), go ahead, good luck finding people to mine it. 
Edit: added the quote that annoyed me.
Edit2: actually I think I misunderstood. The author means nominal GDP as as denominated in the cryptocurrency -- in this case the currency would be WAY more deflationary than bitcoin at the early stages (growing at ~5%/year from some initial block reward), so I guess lots of people would mine. Could be a useful bitcoin competitor in the long run.

@_date: 2015-03-31 12:06:35
So I think you're being a bit too pessimistic. One major practical advantage Bitcoin has is that it is not debt based and the network is independent of the banking system.
The current debt based system is being propped up by central banks -- without which there would be nothing but defaults and deflation across most of the western world (and Japan). Instant transfers don't help so much in a crisis, they'd probably make it worse.  
@_date: 2015-03-22 21:47:29
DarkWallet is the only project I'm aware of that is trying to implement this stuff as the number one priority. I figure if they get funded, it demonstrates there's enough support for the features that other wallets will do the same in order to compete on privacy.

This is only the case if deflation is *unexpected*. Bitcoin is deflationary by design and therefore the deflation is expected. When deciding on interest rates for loans and borrowing people don't just ignore this fact. What matters is the *real interest rate* on a loan. A 10% real interest rate could easily correspond to a -20% nominal rate in bitcoins.
