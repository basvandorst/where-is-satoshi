it probably correlates with trade volume rates
@_date: 2018-01-18 04:57:42
The irony is strong here
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:18:10
As someone who has been studying this strategy using simulations you would be surprised to learn that what looks like the best place to buy and sell changes dramatically as time goes on and what looks good right now is often inaccessible in the near future. Your money can very easily get tied up if the market goes down like right now. So we just have to wait for it to come back, invest more, or in general invest at many price points and reduce downtime but also substantially trade profits for security

I would have told you 14-16 a week ago, 13-15 2 days ago, and 11-15 now
Edit: 3 weeks ago i would say 15-17 is the typical fluctuations
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:33:49
i prefer to use robust than antifragile

A priori correlation means it's not clear which is the cause and which the effect. You're throwing away information by ignoring the this statistic. You may be throwing away information that is sensitive to effects that the trade volume isn't sensitive to, such as the stability of the product's market value.

Too broad to be true

its.... a..... scam

omg what have i done haha they say don't drink and derive
@_date: 2018-09-12 00:11:16
can you provide a link or something?
@_date: 2018-09-12 00:09:23
ha that sounds more like it. any idea what fraction of the world trading volume this is?
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:33:42
Use gdax
@_date: 2018-09-03 14:48:20
Why does it say through instead of trough
@_date: 2018-08-28 14:44:50
Is that... the internet?!
@_date: 2019-03-22 16:39:18
The scales are arbitrary since the axis aren’t the same unit. Is there a conversion between hash rate and money (like the money gained from a hash) that lets you plot them on equal footing?
@_date: 2019-03-22 17:33:10
I think the information contained in hash rate and btc price that might actually be useful is the price gap between the returns from mining and the btc price. I’m still not sold that the plot above is too valuable bc it’s not easy to portray the data in a way that doesn’t bias the audience someway or another. Also the hash rate line is almost perfect power law growth so comparing the btc price to a straight line (on the log plots) is just as meaningful.
@_date: 2019-03-04 04:32:25
fine but we write it after the numbers FOR THE LOVE OF SATOSHI
@_date: 2019-03-11 17:40:09
Numbers are useless out of context* 
But there was plenty
@_date: 2019-03-22 17:01:16
But where you set them equal is arbitrary, so you can shift them up and down however you want. Furthermore, I’m pretty sure your decades aren’t the same spacing between the two scales
@_date: 2018-06-17 13:58:42
10000 dollars make a bitcoin (maybe not right now but we’re doing order of magnitude comparisons here)
So 100 satoshis make 1 penny

It's anecdotal, but I've literally never experienced my bank ever being 'shutdown' and being kept from making transactions with money in my accounts.
@_date: 2019-02-19 02:09:49
Yeah I seriously doubt that will catch on. It’s not fun for the strippers or the clients to play with Monopoly money 
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:18:58
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:12:25
Just trying to hit some stops so the price can be raised and people will have already parted with their cheap btc
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:14:43
Appreciate all the good vibes you’re putting out!
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:09:59
coinbase's app does this
i run OS, idk if there is an android app
@_date: 2018-11-06 19:41:19
investing in crypto is closer to gambling than it is 'investing' so I would probably hesitate to tell my parents about me gambling away all they money they gave me.

I wish. So much crap comes through the mail. 99% ads
@_date: 2019-01-11 05:34:31
So the eye is deceiving. For me to think that your model/prediction is valid I would need to it compared to other simpler models and it be statistically shown that the new model is a better fit to old data than other models. Yes this model looks like it fits, but so do many others that have different outcomes that are equally likely.
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:12:50
ah yes technical analysis analysis
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:39:34
If you remember what you bought at it’s just the ratio of the current price and the buy in price * principal
Buy in at 20k, current price 10k, principal 100$
100 *(10k/20k) = 50
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:23:58
we'll get back there EVENTUALLY! keep the faith
@_date: 2018-07-10 02:45:49
I, for one, like the goatee on the S
