Danny from CoinCorner here, Im very much a maximalist myself (see here  ). 
We do offer Ripple to buy/sell but our gateway is Bitcoin only. 
We've had Ripple on the platform for years, but dont envision being there to much longer.
We all make mistakes ��‍♂️

Bitcoin.com as we are all aware is rather bias to one side, we feel all companies should do their own independent research to find out their customers opinions.  
We are also aware a lot of our customers rely on companies such as ourselves to help guide them in the direction we see fit, so collecting as much information and feedback as possible is great to help us make a clear and concise decision on our direction.  
I'd love to hear opinions and feedback on the debate rather than meaningless comments (no offence!)
