Haha mate in your dreams....
There are millions of things you get wrong.
First you cannot short sell on Gdax except if they allow you to do so which means you have a corporate account.
So you need to buy the 100 bitcoins on Kraken then transfer them which takes an hour (if everything goes perfectly). Good luck to keep a 1.5 million exposure on the bitcoin for an hour. Just start playing Russian roulette or go to the casino it'll be faster and at least you'll have free drinks....
Secondly with an if and a big if you turn out to be able to short sell they won't let you do it without margin. Not sure how much it is but for such big size they might ask you for y lot. Let's say 50%.... So now you don't need 1.6 millions but 2.4.
And obviously you didn't take into account any fee.
Not sure you want to keep such exposure and wait for someone to lift your offer so you have to cross the spread on Gdax after you bought on Kraken... So 25 bps plus 25 bps on kraken. Then I don't think you can settle your short with your incoming bitcoins.... So you have to trade out of your short position and sell your long. I guess they don't allow wash trading so you have to cross the spread twice an fast enough so that you don't get slippage. So that's another 50 bps of fee + huge risk....
And last but not least 100 BTC is no small size. Try to buy 100 BTC on kraken... You'll have to destroy the book for that. We don't speak about EURUSD here....
So try it my guess is that instead of making 50k you'll loose them....
