Someone with your master public key could find all the related addresses, but you are the only person in possession of it, so unless you purposely post it somewhere it won't happen that way.
However, the electrum server you connect to knows your IP and the addresses you've used so far. If the server was malicious it could keep track. You just need to weigh that against the convenience.

IIRC the qt client keeps a running pool of 100 future addresses at all times so I'm also confused how the change key could be lost. It may just be a matter of letting the wallet backup catch up with the blockchain but I don't know what is meant by "send the .2 I sent out back".

This is very unlikely to succeed as laid out.
Developers way underestimate the difficulty of re implementing the protocol. Bitcoinj is the closest there is and it has been under active development for quite a while. It has just now reached the point where it can do SPV mode.
There are so many subtle places where a re-implementation can appear to work correctly but over time will fork the block chain. IMO, there is no way a closed source version without the eyes of many bright people can be trusted to get it right. It will be a long time before any full re-implementation of the satoshi client appears on the scene.

Think about what it takes to successfully pull off a double spend.
In the normal course of business little protection is needed.
When you send bitcoin to the merchant they receive the transaction (almost) instantaneously just like every other node on the network. Now you have a very short window to double spend. Way less than 10 minutes because the miners are already working on blocks including the first version. Moreover, every single node on the network will reject the second spend before its even reaches a miner. It won't even get passed on beyond your peer nodes. 
Assuming the attacker owns a bunch of nodes that would pass on the double spend you would have had to isolate the merchants bitcoin node in such a way that it would see the first transaction but somehow not see the second. You'd basically have to isolate him from the entire network with only your nodes.
Assuming you could somehow do that you then need enough computing power that you can be guaranteed the next block. That's an unspeakable amount of computing power. 
Long story short if the NSA wants to steal a sandwich with a double spend maybe they could pull it off. For any mere mortal its very very unlikely.

You can use an exchange as an ewallet but IMO its best to separate the two.
I keep a small amount of bitcoin at mybitcoin.com for spur of the moment transactions. There was some theft there recently but it was due to the reuse of password form mt gox. I've had nothing but good experiences with mybitcoin.com
As far as exchanges go I've had good experiences with both tradehill.com and mtgox.com. You can use both as an ewallet but keep in mind both are huge targets.

@_date: 2011-07-02 01:10:20
Yup, I'm one of the people trying to implement it. Its still going to be quite a while. 
There are several problems to overcome. The biggest of which is if you released one of these on the network right now it would be rejected. Even if it was accepted none of the clients would know how to spend it. 
At this point if a contract was released for you the client wouldn't even recognize the transaction referred to one of your keys because the script template isn't well understood.
@_date: 2011-07-06 01:40:00
It wouldn't work.
The highest mhash/sec I see from any processor is 60.
That's not going to be worth the electricity to run it. RAM is also useless for mining.
Your best bet is to run a stripped down linux machine with 512 of RAM, an ATI GPU, and no other devices... including a harddrive if you can get away with it.
VMs won't do you any good since they are all sharing a slice of the same CPU.
@_date: 2011-06-25 01:14:25
You won't screw up the network.
Bitcoin is built off a chain of blocks which contain transactions. To create a block you validate a bunch of new transactions and double sha256 hash them. Since the hash is a 256 bit number it can range between 0 and 2^256. The difficult part is creating a block that hashes to a number below a certain number in this range.
Each node of the network uses the same algorithm to independently decide what the difficulty target is. The network wants blocks to be created on average every ten minutes. The difficulty is recalculated every equivalent of two weeks worth of blocks. If blocks are being created faster than this the target number is lowered to the point that if the same amount of collective computing power was applied it would still work out to the ten minute average. 
If you want to try it install the bitcoin software then grab one of the GPU mining programs. Point your miners at the software after you enable RPC and you are all set. The mining subforum on the bitcoin forums would be a good place to start. If your bitcoin software can reach the internet and your super computer can reach the bitcoin software you are all good. You can't do it totally offline though. For a block to be valid it has to be chained to the one in front of it. You need to be able to see these as each one invalidates all the work you have done to that point.
Your supercomputer may or may not be an effective bitcoin miner.
I'm assuming you probably have nvidia GPUs. If so it takes ten of those to equal one ATI card for bitcoing mining. 
The bitcoin network's hashing power is massive. Don't worry about breaking it.

It has nothing to do with intelligence. You shouldn't need to be a security expert to use a computer. Security experts are supposed to design systems resistant to these sorts of things.

@_date: 2011-06-19 16:58:59
You can certainly do this with about 5 minutes work on the source code. Change the genesis block and (while not strictly necessary) change the port.
Its already been done. The largest example would be testnet. Testnet is what we use to write new bitcoin services without risking real bitcoin. You could probably generate a couple hundred testnet bitcoins a day with a decent cpu.
Testnet bitcoins have no value though. Any GPU miner could turn their miner on testnet and wreak havoc: double spending, etc. Everyone knows this so no one would think of transacting in testnet coins. The network is not large enough to be safe.
The power of bitcoin proper is the massive amount of computing power dedicated to keeping them safe. Its a chicken and egg thing: you can't have value without the network power but you can't attract network power without value. Getting lightning to strike twice in this regard will be tough to do. 
There is another implementation/clone of bitcoin that has somewhat taken off: Namecoin. 
Namecoin has a completely different transaction structure and rule set that was attractive to some people. It is used for p2p DNS. Its an interesting project but one that doesn't particularly appeal to me so you'll have to do your own research on it.
Long story short: its not likely that any exact duplicate of bitcoin would succeed. 
HOWEVER, if you can come up with a set of rules that appeals to more people or uses the byzantine general's solution against a different problem set the world is your oyster. I think we'll see many more implementations of the underlying transaction/mining system but none of them will be able to compete with bitcoin as a currency.

You need two types of deposits:
One: Average user pays the bank to secure and insure their bitcoin. Bitcoin will only be released by the bank according to strict security. For example only when a directive to send funds is signed with a particular PGP key. If the bank releases funds and cannot produce the signed directive they are liable. If you get you cert stolen they are off the hook.
The bank charges storage and/or transaction fees to these customer.
Two: "Interest" bearing timed deposits. These are the deposits that insure the other funds. In exchange for locking your bitcoins offline in a lawyers office you receive a portion of the fees from the first accounts. However, your funds are not guaranteed. They will be used in proportion to cover losses from the first type of account. Obviously you would only insure the most trustworthy establishments.

You receive the transactions pretty much instantly. It may be less than the amount of time it takes to verify a credit card transaction and certainly less time than it takes for a debit transaction.
When you receive a transaction its more than the network saying you have a transaction coming.You actually possess the transaction and have verified it in every way. You have validated the keys involved and the balances transferred.
The transactions are received through the P2P network in which all nodes are eventually connected. When a node receives a transaction it forwards it on to every peer except the one that sent it and so on. They propagate extremely fast. Seconds.

The 12 word seed is all you will ever need to restore your wallet. From those 12 words it can determine the private and public keys for every address you will ever need. The most important thing is to keep these 12 words safe. Write them down and store them in a safe place. If you lose them or someone steals them all the BTC in that wallet is gone forever.
Electrum also lets you store an encrypted copy of the materialized version of that wallet live on a computer. This is not something I would do. If you just need to watch transactions to your addresses grab the "master public key" and restore your wallet from that on an internet connected computer. This will let you safely watch your addresses without the chance of someone stealing your btc. 
Personally, when I use electrum to send I boot into a live cd and restore from the 12 word seed. With all the options available between it and armory there is never a reason but to keep a small amount of btc internet connected.

Not all bitcoiners are anti-state. In fact, I know quite a few in real life and none (including me) would fit that label.
If bitcoin adoption succeeds all the same services provided by banks and similar will still be needed. This includes chargebacks and the like. The difference is it just won't happen in the block chain, it will happen in other services that are cheaper than we have today and backed by the finality of the block chain.

I don't see it in the unconfirmed transaction list so it may not confirm at this point. Your wallet is the only part of the network that thinks it will confirm but since it wasn't relayed it never will.
Depending on how many inputs there were in the transaction you may just want to extract the private keys involved and load them into a lightweight client (electrum, etc.) so you don't have to reload the blockchain.
Once in there the new client won't see the stuck transaction and you should be able to spend it to wherever you want.
Whether this will clear the transaction in your old wallet I'm not sure, so make a backup of everything you do. Once the new transaction clears run (assuming its bitcoind or bitcoin-qt) bitcoin-qt -rescan.
If you use electrum for this keep in mind the imported key isn't part of the deterministic key chain so you'll need to keep backups of both the original key and the deterministic change address.

Addresses are somewhat meaningless in this context. You don't spend from addresses, you spend outputs which currently use addresses as a short hand for proof of ownership.

There is a misconception that miners hash the whole block. 
The hash is really only calculated on the block header which is a total of 80 bytes. The individual transactions are represented by the single merkle root. This keeps hashing to a constant time operation, otherwise miners would have an incentive to keep the blocks as small as possible. You can hand out the header all you want, it won't help you recreate the block. If you hit the solution as a mining pool participant there is no way for you to release the full block so you have to submit the solution to get anything at all.

2. Publicly post the bitcoin address here.
3. Have anyone wanting to claim it post a signed message with the private key belonging to the posted address. It could even be done anonymously by just having the claimant post a new address signed with the private key of the old one.

There will be plenty of political and economic responses, but I will give you a technical reason why no state (ie, market data, etc.) outside the block chain can be used, even if there was complete agreement on the source of the data. 
The block chain isn't completely linear in respect to transactions when a reorg occurs. I'm assuming your scheme would require transactions that would have a component that would be valid or invalid based on a particular state of the data. For sake of example, lets say a particular ฿1.0 transaction is worth an extra .01 if outside market state &gt;= x. Your transaction is released and included in a block. A block later this output is spent into another completely valid transaction.
Now imagine the block chain forked right at the block containing the original transaction and the other fork out races the one you were in.
In the normal course of business where no outside state affects transaction viability all the transactions in the orphaned blocks would be culled by the miners and included in new blocks. However, your original transaction presents a problem. What if market state is now &lt; x? Your transaction is now invalid. Not only that, its output was already spent, so now that transaction is invalid as well. 
I'll have to think about the bond scheme some more. There could possibly be something there though not necessarily as you laid it out. Again you have the outside state problem with defining what a year is. For example, what happens if transaction gets reorged into a different year. It could possibly reference block numbers. Not sure.
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:22:33
I'm not so sure it would. 
Unlike exchanges you are already obligated to return $x to the customer. Using the bitcoin network to achieve this should be no different than handing someone a handwritten store credit.
