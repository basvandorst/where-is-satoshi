Not entirely true. Apple is like 3% of his portfolio. (Well, Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio)
I assume you were using data from [here]( but that only takes into account the top 20 stocks that his company owns, and doesn't include any of the wholly owned assets like Dairy Queen, Duracell, Geico, Ben Bridge Jeweler, etc.
However, Berkshire Hathaway does have like 20 billion dollars invested in Apple.

Apple is still one of the largest companies in the world...

A few things I think are worth mentioning:
- You *do* have the ability to wait decades and decades to get wealthy. That's the whole idea behind value investing. You start early (aka 20 years old). It takes something like 65 dollars per month at age 20 until you're 65 to have a portfolio valued at 1 million dollars.
- He and Bill Gates started the giving pledge; getting other billionaires to dedicate *at least* half of their money to charity when they die. He basically helped start the trend of giving generously.
- Since 2006, he's donated 24 billion dollars to charities.

He has very few holdings in tech companies...?
His 3 tech holdings are Apple, IBM, and Verisign. His combined tech holdings are worth about 34 billion dollars. His combined banking holdings are worth about 46 billion dollars, and his combined Food &amp; Drink holdings are worth about 44 billion dollars.
(Not including wholly owned subsidiaries. Which would most notably add Dairy Queen to the mix)

I mean, you're not wrong. It does fit his strategy though. He tends to invest in companies that he thinks will still be around, and making money 10, 20, 30 years from now. And I think Apple fits that bill.

Lol, I marathoned the entire series like 4 months ago. I can't forget now. xD

Yeah, I mean, it's easier to use the primary currency of the country the company resides in, but it's not really necessary.

You could also sell stocks for bananas. Stock is part ownership of a company. And that has value. You can sell that for whatever you want.
However most online investment websites use USD because it's the main currency. I'm sure eventually some will move to Bitcoin, if it keeps getting bigger.

Yeah, the main thing cryptocurrency has going for it is that it's interesting and if I understand correctly, you can't connect buyers to sellers and vice versa. But it's not really backed by anything, AFAIK. At least most other currencies do have some sort of tangible asset tied to it.
Somebody please correct me if I'm wrong on anything. I'd love to learn about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in general.

Mhm. You never want to risk actual gains now for potential gains later. If you've hit or exceeded your original goal(s), reevaluate your investment portfolio.

That's the least promising investment advice I've ever heard.
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:27:28
Agreed. It's *supposed* to be used as a currency (but deflationary currencies don't sound like a good idea, imo) but people are using it as an investment. (and it's not a particularly good investment)
@_date: 2018-04-04 06:36:22
Sorry, I should've said it's not a particularly *safe* investment. Which, in my mind, equals not good.
@_date: 2018-04-03 08:14:32
Isn't that kinda the point tho? Like Bitcoin doesn't really work as a currency unless more people use it.
