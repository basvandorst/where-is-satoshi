@_date: 2017-09-12 15:03:14

@_date: 2017-09-12 15:41:15

@_date: 2017-09-17 08:17:05
not bad
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:38:22
I think it will be around 350bil in 3 years. A 10 years estimate is tough but it doesn't need to be at 20trl to be 1mil per Bitcoin. 
Price is not necessarily the same as value.

@_date: 2017-09-12 14:50:23
yeah boyee
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:06:12
i think it may have already started. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:50:37
Yep. I could be wrong but I noticed that people always sell the news. Im guessing this time it will be no different. then when it locks. boom! to the moon!
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:20:55

@_date: 2017-07-13 16:02:10
Thanks! Yes we accept Bitcoin. Figured it would be hypocritical if we didn't. Plus Bitcoin is BOSS!

Thanks for the update bro

My understanding is the split won't happen until oct-nov time frame. Aug 1st is when it is put in motion. The actual split is the price cutter. If Aug 1st sees a price bump it won't last long.

@_date: 2017-07-13 12:16:23
Ok folks, I made one with a high quality, nano material and with 8 color choices. for $12.99, I am a licensed retailer so I can get this type of stuff done cheap and with the best quality. Knock yourself out. Full disclosure: I make $3-$4 per sale. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:41:57
Thank you. great list. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:01:02

@_date: 2017-07-19 11:21:07
BIP91 hits 80%. Congrats everyone. Especially those who bet almost their entire life savings on it. I am so happy right now. its been a long trip for me since '14. Now just wait for the FOMOers to let us borrow their money again as they enter the market on our way to the moon!
@_date: 2017-07-22 03:09:05
agreed. Terrible customer service. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 02:06:05

100,000 within 5 if there is not a hard fork and scalability is resolved
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:33:30
i know. BIG ifs. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 19:37:37
Yes. Besides being battle tested the NSA invented crypto(SHA256) that Bitcoin uses. But the developers didn't fully trust it by virtue of the fact that is was an NSA derivative. Therefore the added another layer above and beyond SHA256 called RIPEMD. 
I believe it is overkill, but it is a unique difference.
