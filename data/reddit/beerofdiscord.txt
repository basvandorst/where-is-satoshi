People have forgotten that Bitcoin can not only crash for no apparent reason but spike as well. This is normal Bitcoin behavior. The market is still small and all it takes is a couple of big buys and this happens. Same in the other direction.

OK I feel like I have to address this. Yes, I created this account several months ago and I've never posted anything. Why? Because I have been lurking reddit for years anyway - I registered an account basically to try out tipping via bitcointip but for some reason it wasn't working for me so I let it go. Tipping is just a concept which I feel deeply related to...so once the tipping craze started some time ago I felt moved to post.
Anyways what is your point here? That I have some sort of nefarious agenda?
*(sorry for weird post, I am drunk on BEER)*

That's why need to keep tipping creators of quality content to show them that they don't have to rely on ads and clickbait etc. any longer.
@_date: 2014-11-11 15:39:50
This is one counter-argument. Another might be that users will prefer ad-free content. Wouldn't you? 
Also cutting out the middle-man and the associated costs and risks with having one. 
The technology which would give incentive for such a change might indeed be preferable to the old one but we are talking about a change in **culture** here and conscious social action might be needed as well. Hence my OP.
@_date: 2014-11-11 13:34:15
Yes it's about information and communication. What we have now is lots of information but low incentive for it to be of good quality. So we get spam, trolls and bullshit. Let's change this!

You can reclaim your wallet from a seed the trezor device gives you. It is 12 - 24 words long (depending on your security settings). You write that down and keep it safe - but it is a new security risk. You can encrypt it with a password, though but the mytrezor wallet page makes you enter that password when you access their webwallet so that is another security risk.
Perfect security is impossible, but trezor is a damn fine option.

If you want to understand the price movement of 2014, first you have to look a bit further back.
2013 saw an increase in BTC price from about 13$/BTC in January to a peak of over 1000$/BTC in December. It was the year when Bitcoin first gained mainstream exposure beyond the occasional "lol ponzi tulips" article. Venture capital funding started flowing in slowly, as did merchant adoption but this huge run-up in price is mostly being attributed to speculation and possibly some shenanigans at Mt.Gox the then biggest online exchange.
So BTC enters 2014 in a vastly overbought state with Mt.Gox apparently deeper and deeper in problems. China starts banning Bitcoin every other week, people panic sell and the price tumbles. 
In February 2014 Mt.Gox finally implodes, taking about half a billion USD worth of BTC with it. The daily candle for February 25th is a red cross marking its death. It is like a historical marker :)
There was a rebound with people thinking that this had to be the bottom and the bear market is over, but it ended up crashing to even lower levels and finally seemingly stabilizing around 450$. Many proclaimed this to be a new level of stability from which the rocket to the moon could be launched.
The rocket was launched in Late May with some spectacular buying but in the end it turned out to be another dead cat bounce with selling pressure overwhelming demand and causing a crash to yet a lower low.
Upon making that low we had the bearwhale incident which inspired many people to yet again proclaim the bottom of the bear market. We will probably see soon whether they've been right or not.
Meanwhile the important news of 2014 is that the surrounding infrastructure of services and merchants kept growing at an accelerating pace to catch up with the inflated expectations of the 2013 price run-up. Maybe 2015 will be more balanced in this regard for a change :)
Today most coins are being mined by professional operations which presumably sell most of them for fiat in order to recover their investment and cover their operating expenses. Let us not forget that Bitcoin currently still has an inflation of its monetary base of more than 10% p.a. so there has to be new money entering the market constantly just to keep the price the same. 
With all that being said, the amount of potential utility not yet realized by the Bitcoin network is so vast that I like Bitcoin as an investment at this time as well!

You might be right. I remember reading in some article that all the necessary components were invented by 2001 but it might have been factually incorrect or I might be remembering it wrong. If you're right that makes Satoshis achievement all the more impressive!

I think the dogecoin community did well and I disliked the amount of hate it was getting from the bitcoin community. The network effect probably just wasn't big enough to get it off the ground at that time. It still might not be, but this time it feels like we're getting there :)

Actually on second thought, this is an amazing case study in human psychology. Without ever intending to do so I have sparked an idea which would never have occurred to me and the holder of said idea seems convinced that it is true...and to be honest I can't blame him/her because the facts are there. I guess it's just the feeling of being accused of being something you're not is funny :D

ummmm...actually Shadowstats use the same method for measuring inflation the US used until the 1980s when they decided that it's much more beneficial for *them* to start adding a bunch of constants to their calculations.

You can sell them on one of the online exchanges or in person using localbitcoins.com. 
1BTC = 1000mBTC = 1 000 000bits = 1 000 000 00satoshis.
There will only ever be 21 Million BTC. Currently approximately 13.5 Million BTC exist.
With small amounts like 1000 bits you can mostly just have fun tipping people on reddit, twitter, youtube and the like.
@_date: 2014-11-11 13:42:28

Thanks for pointing this out and I think you're right.

Yes you can use changetip in other subreddits, as well as youtube, twitter and some other sites.
Please be aware that to people who don't know Bitcoin a small tip like 100 bits could be interpreted as spam or something rude. It's generally a good idea to tip a decent amount, like at least one dollar - as a way of saying thanks for a really good contribution.
Here, try it out with this!

I think his analogy is a sound one. What we can see happening with language is one protocol (English) slowly assuming the role of universal standard, with local protocols (local languages) still functioning, while having small quirks and variations on an even more local level (dialects). These don't seem to go away any time soon. Then we also have specialized languages like "lawyerese" or "doctorese", programming languages. Diversity is good. One universal standard is useful but having the availability of specialized tools breeds efficiency.
And so it might be with currencies. One protocol assumes the role of global standard. But because geographic location doesn't matter much online, perhaps there will arise a certain amount of specialized protocols differentiated not by their geographical usage, but by their specific utility - perhaps anonymity, low transaction fees or something or other.

The crazy thing is that if you do end up depositing Bitcoin into your account you pretty much can't do anything with it! You can't do payments with your prepaid card, you can't withdraw to your bank account,  you can't withdraw from an ATM. Pretty much the ONLY thing you can do is send the money to a neteller-accepting merchant. 
And there is zero reason to do this (except for pressure from VISA &amp; co.), because by the time you deposit those coins, they have been turned into dollars or euros by bitpay. crazy stupid.

yes you're right that "that guy" might get enough votes if all the discontents voted for him. The question then becomes if that would actually solve anything.
If you're of the opinion that the system is "broken but not unfixable" and the right kind of person might do it...then it appears to be a decent option.
If on the other hand you're of the opinion that the current system produces its results by virtue of being designed in a certain way and the individuals populating power positions within it are of little to no consequence in this - it seems futile. This is also my position.

In pretty much every election around the world the same candidate keeps winning: nobody. If the voter turnout is a (by general standards) respectable 50% and half of those people vote for political party X, the party still got HALF LESS votes than the most popular option - nobody. 
But that is never taken account. Votes for "nobody" are considered invalid. You are allowed to choose your masters from a pre-selected pool of choices but you are not allowed to choose to have NO masters. 
You know what kind of democracy I would support? Let's say there is a parliamentary election. 60% of people show up to vote, 60% of seats are distributed to participating candidates. The remaining 40% are left empty. To pass a law/make a decision parliament still needs a majority of seats INCLUDING the empty ones.
Should less than 50% of people come to vote parliament can not function in accordance to the wish of the majority to NOT HAVE ONE.
Even with a 50%+ voter turnout there would have to be one hell of a consensus to pass anything. fine with me.

Keynesians are collectivists thus for them the "collective" stands above the individual in terms of importance.

Well of course if your basic economic tenet is based around the idea of perpetual growth it is understandable how such a view might come to be. It doesn't help that it's logical when your basic assumptions are fallacious.

How low would the voting turnout have to drop before the actual process would stop being considered legitimate? 
Besides if electing the "right" people who would then go on to pass the "right" laws would bring about peace and prosperity, we would probably have succeeded in some place at some time.
