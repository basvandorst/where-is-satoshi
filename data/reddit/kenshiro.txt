Then why do you like Bitcoin PoW? The rich guy can purchase more miners and get more rewards
@_date: 2019-07-14 10:27:40
In a few months Ethereum will be PoS, you will see if the market likes that technology or not ;)
It's more ethical because PoS doesn't contribute to global warming. As the Bitcoin price raises the energy waste will increase more and more.

Can you put an example of how can updated nodes reach a disagreement and end in different chains using moving checkpoints?
The moving checkpoints are already used by NXT coin and as far as I know they never had any problem with that. You  can read it in "History Attack" section:
"The extreme form of this attack generally fails because the Nxt blockchain cannot be re-organized more than 720 blocks behind the current block height"
It's still a decentralized system, because can be many block explorers. And again the block explorer is only required under a 51% attack, which is an extreme situation.

Ok! :)
@_date: 2019-07-15 09:00:14
Sorry but that's not true. A moving checkpoint is 100% local, each node define its moving checkpoint locally, based on his current block height. It's 100% decentralized. Only under a 51% attack, and only non-updated nodes that are updating during the attack, would need to check against some other source like block explorers. 
The hardcoded checkpoints are different, they are included in the Bitcoin Core (or other) release, but as their code, it's open source and everyone could check if the checkpoint is correct or not.

I updated the description. Now is only about detecting the attack and halt the network, which is easy
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:58:42
Both PoW and PoS require upfront investment. I don't see much difference between instant buy of coins for PoS or having to wait until you receive your miners for PoW. The point is the same, the rich guy gets more in both systems. The important thing is not allowing the rich guy to destroy the network, that's why a coin must be resistant to a 51% attack.
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:03:11
In PoS is the same, normal nodes validate transactions, only nodes that are staking coins get the right to create coins. Staking nodes are the equivalent to PoW miners. Of course, PoS needs very little hardware, even a Raspberry Pi can be enough. The difference between the rich and the poor guy is the same in PoS as in PoW. The important thing is the rich guy can't do nasty stuff like rewriting history with a 51% attack, and they could do that with PoW, but not with the PoS protocol I explain here.
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:26:01
Waiting to see what Ethereum does is a very reasonable option.
Even if there are not enough miners in the market, the rich guy always has an advantage over the poor, no matter if you purchase miners or coins.
The 51% attack is a bug, not a feature. 51% attack is not consensus, the 1% of users could have 99% of Bitcoins (or hash rate) and impose their will to the rest, that's not consensus, that's giving the network to the rich.
Consensus could be achieved with the rules that I'm explaining in this post without being vulnerable to a 51% attack.

[ January 2020 (if there are no more delays)
Even if PoW worked 100% with over supply or solar energy, it still generates heat and contribute to global warming. With PoW there is still the risk of a 51% attack, which could be prevented with the PoS protocol I explain in this post.
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:48:49
moving checkpoints are not centralized. Each node ignore any hard fork beginning in a block deeper than nodeBlockHeight - N
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:41:18
I can't read the full article (not subscribed). It looks they are using unused natural gas, but the problem is the same, unused gas don't generate heat, but if you burn it for mining then yes. The heat generation is a problem, especially if Bitcoin reaches 1 million dollars, which could perfectly happen. I bet a good percent of this heat will be wasted.
There are several PoS coins working there, some use the moving checkpoints rule that I'm proposing here like NXT coin. I don't see that any of these coins have been hacked. 
The PoS tradeoffs can be fixed:
\- Long range attacks are prevented with a hardcoded checkpoint each a few months.
\- 51% history rewrite attacks can be prevented with the moving checkpoints rule. Bitcoin PoW is vulnerable to this attack.
\- Offline nodes that connect to the network can know what chain is the correct one checking a block explorer, and only if the network is being attacked. Normally there are no forks longer than N and the node can just follow the longest chain without external information.
@_date: 2019-07-15 09:05:55
I understand, but if bitcoin mining is more and more profitable, who is going to prevent that others use dirty electricity?
@_date: 2019-07-15 09:09:27
Of course mining pools are not interested in harming Bitcoin, but mining pools could be hacked to participate in an attack against their own will :)
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:12:56
Just to clarify, the moving checkpoint must be so deep in the blockchain that it's never reached by a hard fork under normal circumstances, like 10 blocks (100 minutes) or more, like 12 hours of blocks.
So the checkpoint will only be reached if the network is under a 51% attack or if there is some network problem that splits the network during more than N blocks (like internet being splitted during many hours). Both problems are very rare and can be fixed with a hard fork. The moving checkpoints are there to prevent a history rewrite if one those rare situations happen.
I remember you that NXT uses moving checkpoints and as far as I know it doesn't have any problem with that.
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:08:24
No, all the nodes will use the same N. This protects updated nodes, nodes that were disconnected and don't have the last block must check after updating that they are in the correct blockchain, which is very easy with a block explorer. But the normal situation is that there are no 51% attacks and nodes can just update as always. And of course, if diverging chains appear because of the attack, the nodes that are updating blocks in that moment will detect it, stop downloading more blocks and ask the user what is the correct blockchain, which again can get checked with a block explorer.
@_date: 2019-07-11 11:44:13
I prefer Bitcoin Confidential :)  But anyway I want Bitcoin to become eco-friendly and resistant to history rewrite attacks.
@_date: 2019-07-11 12:23:46
Yep, I updated the description. Now is only about detecting the attack and halt the network, which is easy
@_date: 2019-07-14 14:11:30
Why centralized? Nodes generate blocks according to their stake which is fair. i.e.: if you have 80% of coins you generate 80% of blocks. And it's resistant to a 51% history rewrite attack using the checkpoint system I explain in this post. Bitcoin PoW is vulnerable.
With PoW the rich guy can buy more miners, create more blocks and get more rewards. In PoS the rich guy buy more coins which allow him to create more blocks and get more rewards. It's the same.
@_date: 2019-07-11 12:38:05
You are already trusting the developers when running his software, so I don't see the problem.

PayJoin gives privacy with the rest of the world breaking the common-input-ownership heuristic, the point here is to have privacy with the person you are paying. That person can follow the change address of the input you use to do the PayJoin transaction and can easily know that you own a high number of BTC.

2/3 of validator signatures, based on staking power. Validators make an investment to run a validator node, so they are interested in follow the rules to make a profit, just like the miners. To have more than 1/3 of the staking power and halt the network, you need an investment of more than 4 billion dollars at current price, if only 10% of the coins are staked. And if you do it, the community could burn your stake in a hard fork.
@_date: 2019-12-12 18:06:45
I think I have the evidence:
\- BFT based PoS is currently used in Tendermint Core: [
\- BFT based PoS is going to replace PoW in Ethereum: [
@_date: 2019-12-12 21:24:00
Validators (like miners) get the coins plus the fees while there is coin emission, after that only the fees. If millions of people use Bitcoin, there will be lot of fees and it will be more than enough.
@_date: 2019-12-13 21:09:00
Yep, not purchasing AntMiners, but developing its own technology. An state could hypothetically develop a secret technology much more powerful that the currently available civilian technology, even if that setup needs the space of several football stadiums.
An state could also hack the people that owns the resources (like mining pools) instead of purchasing/building them. They could set up an operation to hijack the 2-3 biggest mining pools and rewrite maybe 1 month of history, causing millions in loses and destroying the reputation of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-13 09:52:26
The answer was for you. If you run a validator, you have a right proportional to your stake to create blocks, and that rewards you with btc. There is a direct incentive, and greed is still here.
@_date: 2019-12-13 09:54:44
Thank you! But why do you think this consensus protocol is not censorship resistant? It looks more robust than current protocol. If some state secretly discover a new technology much more powerful than current miners, could rewrite bitcoin history at will. With this protocol, is not possible. The worst thing can happen is that the network is halted  and it can be fixed with a hard fork.
@_date: 2019-12-12 21:21:11
It's exactly the same, in PoW, the rich guy can buy more miners (plus discounts for buying in bulk) and earn more money than the poor guy.
As in PoW, anyone can join PoS staking, but without energy waste. You can set a cheap node in the cloud and get the rewards, no need of exchanges. Staking in exchanges is a good option for normal people that don't want to mess with that.
