Pissed off that you failed to get involved in crytpocurrency and therefore were left out of all of the gains? Or are you just a shill for fiat currency?

Just because something is in a bubble doesn't mean it's automatically doomed to disappear. We still have tulips ya know.

What would a crash be? Well, we would have to see a dive well below the 150 day SMA, for one thing. So far it looks like $BTC has once again bounced off of that curve. 
Beyond that, I'd probably have to look at the standard deviation of the daily %-change. 
** Edit: stdev seems to be around 7%, so now I just need the mean and I can figure out if we've seen a crash. Of course, I should probably check to see if there's a roughly normal distribution. Actually, it's probably better approximated by a log normal distribution, eh?

Manipulation usually means covert actions meant to produce a certain result for personal benefit, not to blatant regulation.

Nah, the government will use anonymous accounts and the just not prosecute itself.

But the real question is, does he mean cigarettes or bundles of sticks?

I think the shorter change just gets orphaned. But as the SE answer mentions, anyone in the orphaned block would likely know they were going to be orphaned by the drop in TX rate.

Gambling, definitely gambling. The technology itself is revolutionary, but which specific blockchain/token pair will win is anyone's guess.

In this way it shows how inefficient proof of work can be.

I'm not saying that bitcoin is going to die. I have no idea whether it will or won't survive. It's certainly not the best cryptocurrency around, but that doesn't mean it won't last. It is incredibly high risk, and if it does crash, it will be hard. So far I would call what's been happening a "correction" and not a crash.

You have no idea which crypto assets will survive. If you're worried about fiat currency, diversify though many crypto assets and physical gold and silver.

I am tired of these off blockchain exchanges. I want to see a completely automated exchange, on the blockchain, direct wallet to wallet transfers. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:30:44
That depends on the blockchain.

The crash hasn't happened yet.
** Edit: Clearly people are not understanding what I am saying. These speculative assets have a much higher volatility than normal assets. Because of that, we cannot use the same rules of thumb that we use for measuring corrections, crashes, bear markets, bull markets, etc wrt stocks. 
I would suggest looking at the daily volatility of BTC, fit it to a (log)? normal distribution, and then see if it's "unusual." I would call a crash a %-decline greater than two standard deviations beyond the normal decline.
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:15:17
I wouldn't judge bear and bull conditions, in such a highly speculative market, the same way I would for stocks, etc. Bitcoin is a lot more volatile. That being said, BTC has been well off its highs for a while now and has touched its 60 day SMA.

If you actually cut off part of the internet, kind of like what China tries to do with its "Great Firewall" then you would have two sets of nodes which cannot communicate. But this situation is not the same as a true fork, as both chains can potentially communicate and update their information.
** Edit: Shorter changed is orphaned, not merged. Sorry about that.

That's absurd. Maybe see if a local news station will pick up the story. It could go viral.
