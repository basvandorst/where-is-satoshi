Years ago, I told a few family members about bitcoin. My kids and I had just started using it but it was really the potential is had in developing countries that I was most fascinated with. Anyway, my brother laughed at me and was still mocking me just as recently as $4000ish. My dad basically didn't believe anything I said about it and completely blew me off. When it was around $600, I sent them all the referral link from Coinbase for the $10 incentive. My dad said nothing, my brother said he didn't think it was a good thing to spend his money on (he's really big into investing), and my mom promptly purchased a decent amount. I can safely say she is very happy with me today. She has never spent a penny of it and probably wouldn't even know how. She asked me if she should cash in when it hit $10,000. But, what do you say to that? I told she had to make that call.

You mean I can't make the mafia a good thing by joining and working from within?

Who are you checking with? A quick search on sunbiz seems to show a few was recently paid.

I commented on a post about the paper wallets given as gifts. I wanted to know how to do it as well and hand them out at Christmas. Was downvoted. Not ONE person said 'here's a link on how to print these neat little things'.
I wanted to get people started with bitcoin. Fuck me, right?

She'll still like you, maybe, but you'll be friend zoned forever.

To be fair they can do this even when you don't pay in bitcoin. It's been crazy watching my parents buy and build in Nica. Every so often the government comes in and says 'yeah, you don't legally own this property'. It seems to coincide with political turmoil and what the sandinistas are up to but I don't know that's for sure the cause.

I thought it was arrow of light and one of the religious ones that could be worn both as a cub scout and boy scout. Ten years ago there were 2 we were told could be transferred from the cub scout uniform to the boy scout one. Things may have changed.

What's with the skepticism? This isn't USAA's only involvement with bitcoin; they invested in Coinbase. And while I don't use Coinbase as a wallet I like the idea that I can check Coinbase on the same app as my USAA. Coinbase is still having issues linking some credit cards so I still have to wait the 4 days to get mine. I check my banking details *and* see if I got my coins yet. I linked my accounts as soon as I got the announcement email.
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:51:31
Was there any reason to think they would? When I was on the phone with a representative a few days ago he said there was no issue whatsoever with me connecting my account to coinbase.

I found some Etsy sellers taking btc a while back. They gave discounts for btc purchases too. This was at least 2 years ago so there have been women in btc for a while. Maybe we just don't go on about it on the internet like men do.

I hope this is in the US soon. I purchased coin last week and I'm just tried of waiting 4 days every time. There's a LibertyX 30 min north of me and I'm going to use them until I can use my debit card on Coinbase. I've been very happy with Coinbase but I'm anti-credit card and I don't want to get one just for bitcoin purchases.
@_date: 2015-08-22 16:32:25
No, I haven't looked into it.
@_date: 2015-07-23 14:55:18
Okay, I'll just try it with a Mastercard and see if it goes through.
@_date: 2015-07-23 14:54:28
Ah, okay. Thanks. I rarely need it right away but I'm planning a trip and the 7 day wait is a PITA this time.
@_date: 2015-07-23 22:31:13
Ok, sure thing. I figured I could email but thought I'd get a quicker reply on reddit. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 14:57:56
So the USD wallet is on Coinbase website? I don't know, that doesn't sound like what I need because I buy my coin when I have extra money available. I don't really have a stack of cash to keep sitting in coinbase. But thanks for the reply.

Yeah, I'm totally baffled that he/she hasn't read Rothbard. I'm an econ major, just now taking my 2nd econ class, and we've already had to watch several videos with him.

" is now allowing members to view bitcoin balances on  and on mobile!"
This was the announcement on their FB page. I'm no genius but I don't see "limited roll out" any where on there.
@_date: 2015-11-05 22:02:50
Well, I'm not one that got to participate. I think when Coinbase announced this they should have been clear that it was limited.

My son asked me to see this with him when it was in theaters. I was like, hell yeah! I knew he wanted to see it because of A$AP Rocky and I figured he invited me because it had bitcoin talk in it. Nope, he was all shocked and staring at me when they brought up bitcoin; he didn't know beforehand. Any way, I love anything that can bring together a mom and son.

We should really stop calling it the 'justice system' and just refer to it as the *legal* system.

You might have to pay the fed taxes on your 5 goats (or bitcoins) but Florida has no income tax so this could still be a win for Floridians.

Damn, this reminds me of when I first started meeting Ron Paul people. I was told I was a communist and not liking RP was basically the same as spitting on the constitution. 3 years of knowing these people made me hate the congressman even more. It took curiosity piqued about the federal reserve in an economics class for me to ever read a word that man wrote.
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:00:21
I really want to do this but don't know how. I think it's a great gift for the person that has everything.

I don't use drugs other than nicotine but this makes me sad.

In my accepted payment area I added "do you even bitcoin, eBay?"
Nothing ever happened but I wasn't selling anything bitcoin related. I just want to be able to accept btc as payment.
@_date: 2013-08-14 01:30:28


I thought this as well.

I don't have any BTC or really even understand it. But I hear about it every day b/c of some of the stuff I listen to. The other day, my 17 year old son brings up Zimbabwe currency. That lead to me telling him how a friend had some signed by Ron Paul which lead to me telling him about BTC. I was just telling him off hand but he had so many questions and was really intrigued. He wanted to know why I hadn't bought any and if I was going to. I felt terrible because he wanted to know and I just know so little about it. So, I don't know if he was asking because of what happened in Zimbabwe or if he was just curious like imahotdoglol said.

Ha this is the best story I've read all week!
@_date: 2013-03-21 06:17:20
I haven't heard anyone say it's a way to "hide" from the government. Ive heard AnCaps say it's a to use less federal reserve notes and much discussion on how it's not totally anonymous. 
I can't read your tone here, but aren't you glad there's an uptick in bitcoin use and interest?

I am really surprised at all the USAA hate. I've had an account with them for over 30 years and other banks here and there. USAA beats them all hands down and I even felt that way back when I had to mail my checks in. However, I do think the changes in their mobile version have turned it to shit and now only one devise we own is capable of mobile deposit.
