Should i keep my money for a few month and buy $100 hash power or invest them month by month ?
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:54:14
I see your point. But the thing i wanted to meant is how would i earn $26.000 instead of $260 with 20$
Its just an example..

You are so kind thanks a lot. That is what i was looking for!
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:16:13
Yeah you're right. Actually I wanted to be clear about my statement.  I can't invest like $100 per month into bitcoin. Can't afford. I mean are there sites which provides good miners, fauchets or are there any way that i don't know...
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:10:16
It's per month. And if you have a ps4 in here people thinks that you are rich..

Thanks for reply, i am newbie in Reddit also trying to figure it out too :)
If you were earning 400$ monthly how would you get rich ?
What would you do..?

As i told before i am doing a research, gathering peoples opinions to make my way better. Why that had to be a dream can't i invest $20 ?
Isn't that a investment...

I'm 18 and university student. No kids no wife. Working, paying university taxes and course bills...

The problem number one is just a paradox as you know. And the second problem is not a problem at all. I am trying to plan my future. It's not a dream...
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:53:00
You can't rent a house for $200 dollar in here. Just telling.
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:37:01
Yes I agree and I am trying to make plans about my future here. I didn't meant tomorrow actually.

Sounds emotional but i think i wont go for dates until i can hold on to life myself at all.
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:11:19
I don't even smoke, have fun outside...
It's barely enough for my education.

Is life that for you ? Surviving ? I wanna eat meat everyday, wanna have a good car and wanna travel the world. Is my salary makes me a survivor instead of human ? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:00:59
would you be more specific please ?
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:09:03
I think that's not about with me at all...
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:51:59
