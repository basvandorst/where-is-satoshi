Good to be part of it 
@_date: 2015-12-14 21:28:10
Oh man... What have I started?! 
@_date: 2015-12-14 08:50:23
Thanks! 👍😃
@_date: 2015-12-14 16:50:44
It's not.  It's gambling money 😜
@_date: 2015-12-14 16:50:11
This is money I can afford to lose, thus why it's taken so long to top it up. All I keep hearing about bitcoin is it's volatility and that you should invest what you can spare.  We are not all as well off as you!  
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:31:37
Helpful! I realise I can Google but I was hoping for some standard ones that are generally used.
@_date: 2014-11-05 10:37:55
No.  This is centralisation at its finest. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 22:59:09
I asked if there were any bitcoin millionaires here a while ago. I think this is a cool sub.  Where else would the rich and not so rich interact daily.  
Its a crazy thing this bitcoin. :-) 
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:42:21
What they are.. What they do.. How they are spent.. Mined. Etc etc. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:46:15
I'm sorry you don't understand me or my grammar.  I have the pics I need thanks to other less anal members.. But thanks for your wasted time anyways.
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:34:07
@_date: 2014-06-16 20:08:31
First! Nice idea!  
Edit: tweeted u too.   
@_date: 2014-03-29 16:38:29
Oopsie! 
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:44:08
These are perfect.  Many thanks.
@_date: 2014-06-16 20:42:05
Thanks :-}

How would the retailer / exchange know?  (Without conducting due diligence on every single transaction)
@_date: 2014-04-01 08:44:49
Dammit the chart looks better like that!! 0_o
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:08:54
Buy high... Sell low... And MOOO... Oh wait! :-/
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:49:50
Install bitcoin-qt,  sync, import wallet.dat,  profit! 
Edit: or import the wallet.dat to blockchain.info 
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:26:03
To add to the.. This is a dumb idea comments...
What if said thief has already spent some at a legitimate exchange / retailer / whatever?  
The persons / service receiving them coins for payment would be pretty pissed if the "community" then nullified them. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 09:18:45
More people want bitcoins... Bitcoins become worth more...
@_date: 2014-03-31 22:14:48
Hodl! 
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:42:55
Awesome cheers. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 19:29:25
Go here 
Boot that from USB with your hard drives disconnected and network unplugged.  
Print wallet.. Profit?! 
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:50:04
Yeah coz some bored mutha like yourself might have nothing better to do.
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:36:21
Its an introductory article.  So anything that will help a reader's understanding. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:32:45
True dat ;-/
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:51:51
Yep.  Got dat right boi!  Go waste someone else's time. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:40:24
As soon as I have anything over beer money in an online wallet or exchange I send it to my cold storage.  It makes me paranoid because of hearing of silk road, silk road 2 and now mtgox.  
It is the whole principle of bitcoin after all. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 17:11:44
This!!  
@_date: 2016-01-16 22:20:17
I'm a new user.  No problems as yet. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 22:14:10
@_date: 2016-01-16 22:18:33
Cheers! 😁 why u close the account tho??
@_date: 2013-10-24 17:21:39
Most untrue article ever! Mining ... Profitable? Hah! 
@_date: 2013-10-22 12:03:05
Cant. Because that inloves me paying thru them with my credit card.  I would do the chargeback thru my card company using their protection.  I made the purchase from my paypal balance and their terms say they dont cover virtual goods.
@_date: 2013-10-22 09:52:49
Ok. True.  But how is your average Joe Bloggs going to find it when this kinda stuff happens all the time?!
@_date: 2013-10-21 13:59:20
Well.. the seller just responded to the dispute.  Saying it was a purchase of virtual goods.  Thus my money isnt protected now.  And I wont see it again.  Fuck you scammers! Grrr.  Way to put a man off.  :-(
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:01:57
Still cool tho.. Even if its only one or two.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:37:14
I tried to buy from a forum user.  Of course it was my first time buying and I didn't check the profile out properly.  I learned my lesson.
I am located in UK and it is extremely hard to buy at a reasonable price here.  But maybe you are right.. And to spend 50% would be a reasonable idea.
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:20:05
Yeah it is.  Its primarily a media server.  All the media is on nas so it would be fine.  A format would only normally mean just setting it all up again.  If there wasn't bitcoins on the internal drive. 
I may just move my qt installation with hindsight! 
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:59:26
Asked a million times already.. Google is your friend.
@_date: 2013-10-20 06:24:27
Your so right.  With hindsight I look back at the forum post and I think.. how stoopid am I.  I think I just got the bug and had to buy.
Will think twice next time.  But thanks for the input.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:14:57
Guess what people... I just made my first purchase!  Its not much.. 0.5 coins.. But ya gotta start somewhere eh?!
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:21:40
20-40 would be amazing!  A chance for us late arrivals to have a go. :)
@_date: 2013-10-22 09:55:27
I ♥ cash :)
@_date: 2013-10-22 09:58:17
Just started litecoin mining too.  Not sure really where litecoin is going tho.  Didnt a scypt asic just get announced? 
@_date: 2013-12-14 14:01:56
I think this is how it could work.  I'm not really sure.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:52:30
Woah... This is an epic thread!
One day.. One day maybe I will be a minor percentage as rich as this fella.  
Just wish that day was tomorrow! 
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:26:12
And feckin gone again!  Wtf!
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:42:03
Also.. Why do we have to own?! Why is it such a mandatory thing that everyone works towards?!
Sure I wanna pass something on to my kids. But working hard my whole life .. To save and pay for it.  There must be more to life than this!
@_date: 2013-10-22 09:54:24
Tried to buy some on a forum. Paid with paypal (from my balance, not a card) and never got the coins.  Paypal wont refund. Cant do a chargeback.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:04:29
Thanks for the advice.. +ALL
Edited: my first attempt at a tip.  Hope it works.
@_date: 2013-12-14 12:48:05
I think there should be an accompanied app.  The fob has a small LCD and a button.  Pressing the button reveals the public address.  And the private key can only be revealed by using the app and a pin or password and then using NFC triggering the fob to display it. Maybe then the transfer of funds would go from the fob to a new address setup by the app and then onto the payee.  
Just a thought.
@_date: 2013-10-22 11:22:01
Useful comment! (Not)
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:22:34
Of course.. But this is just beyond belief.  2 times hand written begging letters for fucks sake.  A bit much isn't it??!!
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:05:04
I am (potentially) an employer.  I would do this!
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:05:11
I just visited it thru chrome on android and it tried to download loads of apps to my phone.
I say scam! 
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:39:17
Yes agree with what your saying.  I just think they are asking a little too much.  
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:38:56
I bought a 150gh/s contract for 24 hours.  The guy hooked up to my p2pool node and I could see the stats etc.  It cost me £67.99 and it netted me about £100 worth of bitcoin.  So they aren't all scams.  
@_date: 2013-10-22 10:56:59
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:19:50
Hit me again! :-P
@_date: 2013-10-22 12:00:45
As it keeps being pointed out to me it was my naivety that got me here.  My not doing enough research or whatever.  But this doesnt make me much different from 99% of newcomers to the bitcoin universe.
Yes.. my own actions or inactions got me here... but this is a typical path that alot of people have been down. 
You know the saying.. start as u mean to go on.  Well I might be more inclined to stop. Now. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:20:40
Wow.  When u look at it like that you have good reason to hate banks!
@_date: 2013-10-22 12:27:03
Wut he said ;-)
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:31:38
I plan too.  Tried already and got scammed.  Being MUCH more careful this time.  
Was actually waiting for a bit of a decline but I'm still .. Here .. Waiting :-/
@_date: 2013-10-19 11:16:49
How do I do a chargeback??
Edit: just googled it and cant do that as it came out of my balance :-/
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:29:23
Only tip I tried to give never got accepted.  Such an awesome bot tho :-)
@_date: 2013-10-19 06:47:48
The payment came from my paypal balance.  Not from a credit card.  So if I have filed a dispute with paypal will they reverse it?
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:30:11
What he said.  Check, and then double check.  If something doesn't add up.. Go elsewhere.
Been scammed too. Not nice.  Lost a fair chunk.  In my terms anyway. 
@_date: 2013-09-30 17:39:18
I wondered why p2pool's hashrate just doubled :-/
@_date: 2013-10-22 12:56:03
Oh man.  Another victim of a scammer.  Not good. :-(
@_date: 2013-12-14 12:51:14
I have used paper wallets.  And I agree they are just as useful.  But my thinking is this might be quite cool.  And maybe something people would buy?!
@_date: 2013-10-22 10:04:29
Thats the worry here too.  Converting back to cash.  Two possible points where I can lose it all. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:29:49
Thanks for your opinion.  One of the main reasons I took up mining is because it is so difficult / unreliable to get money into / out of bitcoin exchanges.  I look forward to the day that some of the larger institutions actually take notice and give us a break from scammers and untrustworthy types.
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:52:37
Its just a throw away wallet... Most is in cold storage!
@_date: 2013-10-19 10:29:01
Yeah.  Thats how it happened.  Paid and now no coins or contact.  Shoulda known better. :-(
@_date: 2013-10-22 10:56:29
apologies... i knew this would be taken out of context.  no particular fuckwit.  i meant everyone says dont mine buy!
@_date: 2013-10-19 07:05:06
Thats what I did.. so crossing my fingers and hoping this will just be a lesson learned :-/
@_date: 2013-10-22 11:57:13
I will admit.  I am impulsive.  And a n00b.  But I am not much different from most people coming into this.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:51:59
I think I have already registered for coinfloor.  I'm not sure.  I have already registered for several exchanges so when my predicted dip comes ..?? I may be ready to buy.  If not, there is always localbitcoins so I will be a proper investor soon! :-)
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:20:27
And its back!  Just like that!
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:07:32
Thats what I'm after!  How much easier could it get?! 
Edit:  Now can we haz this in UK plz!
@_date: 2013-10-19 11:02:02
Just called paypal.  They cant escalate the dispute for 7 days.  But apparently the funds will be frozen and if the person doesnt respond to the dispute they will refund me. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 14:03:24
I'm not completely familiar with how the change thing works.  Still quite new to all this.  I'm sure in principle this could work though.
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:17:13
Boo!  
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:54:36
Haha!  Cheers for the drunk money!
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:21:10
What happens if we don't pay?? They get the house!  They don't lose!
@_date: 2013-10-22 10:16:12
Have put an ad on localbitcoins just yesterday.  So hoping for more luck on there!  
Thanks for the tip.  Now to figure out how to use it! 
@_date: 2013-11-01 07:33:42
So paypal closed the dispute in the scumbags favour today.  Gutted.
