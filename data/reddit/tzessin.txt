That's because Visa implemented a new rule that merchants don't need signatures for transactions under $25. This was done to appease quick service restaurants and gain card acceptance (primarily at McDonalds which did not accept credit/debit cards until this rule was changed in 2002). They have zero liability when you don't sign for under $25 purchases.

Hence why many businesses refuse to take checks. RBF just gives them more of a reason to refuse to take bitcoin.
*edit* modern services by TeleCheck and others allow for real-time verification of funds at the POS.

You failed to read the first line of my original post 'If RBF is fully implemented **enterprise and mid-market merchant adoption** will crawl to a snail's pace'. I am talking about the Fortune1000 merchants of the world.
Bitpay does nothing in terms of guaranteeing funds until 6 confirmations.  (read page 6)
Coinbase does guarantee merchants full liability transfer typically within 2 seconds even if someone pays using another wallet provider.  (read bottom of page).
Support for RBF is voting against merchant adoption. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 16:52:20
Square &amp; Stripe rely on coinbase and coinbase relies its ability to support 0-conf transactions. 
If RBF is fully implemented, then coinbase can no longer offer instant guarantee of funds and any merchant with a business model (and downstream systems) that require instant guaranteed notification/authorization.
Thus, RBF will hurt all merchants and slow adoption. Which is bad in my view.

You somehow seem to think that said camera has the ability to identify a person from the video and that said person's identity is the magically uploaded into a shared database and given a 'Wanted criminal status'.
You also seem to think that the police will work on a case for someone that defrauded a business out of a small amount of money by double-spending bitcoin. Go ahead and see what happens by asking a cop what resources would be deployed for someone that wrote a bad $10 stolen check (hell even a $100 check).
Have you seen the 'video footage' that comes from most B&amp;M robberies? More often than not those cases go unsolved and they are a much higher priority that low dollar theft/fraud due to force and the threat of violence being used.

If RBF is fully implemented enterprise and mid-market merchant adoption will crawl to a snail's pace and some merchants that currently accept bitcoin will be forced to stop or treat bitcoin payments different (in a bad way) than all other payment methods. (ie, MSFT Points, MovieTicket.com, O'Reilly Media). 
Many merchants have commerce infrastructure that requires payment methods to provide an instant authorization; without this serious and unacceptable issues arise (tickets for anything sold by anyone other than the actual venue/airline/movie theater/sports team/performer, instant downloads, media paywalls, in-person retail transactions, etc.).  
Asking a merchant to spend +$5M to upgrade their SAP ERP or Oracle EBS architecture just to accommodate bitcoin is not going to happen anytime soon. 0-conf transaction risk can be quantified and accepted as the network stands today, if we support full RBF then 0-conf ends and so does a massive merchant market. 
Personally, I like the idea of being able to use bitcoin in my daily life to pay for goods and services from merchants that today only accept cards and PayPal.
@_date: 2015-06-18 18:07:19
That's because the payment cards they process are covered under the Bank Secrecy Act and (in theory) the bank that issued the payment card has already done KYC and OFAC checks on the customer. Because of this, card processors fall under an exemption from being an MSB. 
With bitcoin no one has necessarily checked to see if the user is on the OFAC denied parties list. I'm not happy about it, but that is the way it is. That being said, one might successfully argue that bitcoin processors are acting only as an agent on behalf of a merchant and find an exemption that way.
Worst part of being an MSB in bitcoin - try finding a way to comply with the Travel Rule (

1. Same day ACH is and will always be hated by the larger banks as it eliminates significant advantages afforded to them over regional banks and credit unions. 
2. Even if the U.S. Gov't is able to force adoption of same day ACH it still relies on coordinated movement of funds at the level of the FED across all the nation's banks and thus can only happen once per day.
3. ACH will never be 'free'. (How else can NACHA pay salaries /s)
4. Pull payments are inherently flawed in the modern world; hackers will hack.

Don't throw so much hate at CurrentC. I can promise those behind it are talking to BTC companies and they understand that account credentials do not belong on the device (NFC secure element), and should remain in the cloud. The QR approach is tailor made for BTC retail.
Also, extend Apple Pay to eComm or mobile (away from store) shopping. If a retailer adopts it, then every new customer using it will checkout as a guest and not register with the site.
Just give them (and the world) some time.

Banks process thousands of SAR's each day. They are not as scary as they sound. 
Anytime anyone pays over $10,000 in cash for ANYTHING the business is required to file a SAR. Take $10K to a car dealer - SAR. Payoff your personal loan with $10K or more - SAR.
Don't fret over them, but if you are a business DO COMPLY.

Unless the merchant has abided by Visa rules. Then the issuing bank eats it and it cannot be passed onto the customer or the merchant.
ie, EMV at POS, transactions with swipe (track 1 and 2 data) and a signature, or transactions under $25 with track 1 and 2 data.
It's only eCommerce merchants that get royally screwed as they do not get a signature.

Just think about their business model and their customer experience. It just doesn't work with push payments and requires a pull mechanism.
One of the main premises of Uber is it's 100% friction free. Requiring a prepayment based on estimated fare and a true-up payment just isn't practical. Avoiding the prepayment opens up drivers and Uber to unpaid trips.

This (RBF) is horrible for mass merchant acceptance.
@_date: 2015-07-12 16:27:03
Not allowing the activity is fine with me and their right as a business. However, this part is where they cross the line:
"Collect and submit your personally identifiable information to state and federal authorities."
If using the site or buying ads from the site was a crime, then it would be shut down. Collecting and submiting personally identifiable information to state and federal authorities for something that isn't a crime is insaine and feels like a scare tactic that is uncalled for.
@_date: 2015-07-01 21:41:46
Yes! Best comment here. All I read about on Reddit is people not wanting to spend on merchant sites (unless they get big discounts), then concurrently hearing people complain that their favorite merchant doesn't accept bitcoin.
