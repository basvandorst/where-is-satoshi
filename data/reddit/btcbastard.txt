So running a fully validating node even without the inbound connections is still contributing positively to the network in a major way yes?

Luke Dash always says allowing inbound connections isn't that important.  Can anyone ELI5 to me why that is?

Anyone know if bakkt will be taking advantage of blockstream liquid side chains to facilitate the movement of the bitcoin assets off chain?  And if lightning will be the layer used to facilitate the retail transactions?  Either way this is exciting and a good reminder of why keeping the block size limit small is so important.  Big istitutions were bound to come into this space but as long as running your own  node is efficient and chrap as possible and the network having as many nodes as possible, bitcoin will always remain as decentralized as mich as it can be and as decentralized as much as you want it to be.
