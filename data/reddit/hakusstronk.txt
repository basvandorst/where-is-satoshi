Jack Dorsey is evil, and hates America because he doesn't support Free Speech.  Spare me you bullshit about private companies etc.  Fact is that Jack and his army of ball cupping losers would be the first to throw their own families on a train to head to concentration camps.  They would sit back and say to themselves that its alright since those people had "wrong think" and were not people anyways.  This is how it begins...

Amazing how little you value free speech.  Or fail to understand the spirit of the Bill of Rights that put it into place.   I'd bet you are a young white college aged male from the middle/upper that has never needed to challenge their thoughts before.  I know its hard to wade through opposing views and looking at an issue critically, but its necessary for you to ever grow as a person.  Do you have any argument beside the private company thing??

Which is why the laws need to be changed so that they are classified as a publisher, or other protections are put in place.  Amazing how everyone writes off Free Speech as something worth ignoring or putting restrictions around.  Thank God some of us in the US still believe in the constitution    The more you write us off the more we join arms and fight back, and we gotta lot of fight in us when it comes to the basic foundations that this country was founded upon.
