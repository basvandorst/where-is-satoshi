Bitcoin thrives exactly due to greed.

There is no us as a community. The basic premise of Bitcoin, and what makes it work, is that everyone is in for himself.

You are describing sidechains which are already in the works but we don't have a way to do them trustlessly yet.

That is not proof that bitfinex trades in USDT though, just that some people think it is. On the bitfinex subreddit people are depositing and withdrawing USD

There are definitely some skilled devs working for your favorite coin but don't let your bag fool yourself.
@_date: 2018-10-14 11:03:23
But why would they? Do you go around telling people how much money you have?
@_date: 2018-10-15 16:31:36
The reason they're not being used is because DEX between crypto and fiat is a pipe dream. You cannot trustlessly exchange a trustless currency with one powered by a chain of trust.
@_date: 2018-10-15 12:52:47
Do you have a source for this? They have no usdt deposits or withdrawals.

It is not impossible however are you willing to invest millions of dollars for the next million years for the chance to win 1BTC?  
I will offer you a even better and cheaper deal, you send me $100 and I send you back $0.01 - we can do this for how many rounds as you want and you'll still win more in the long run than digging for btc.

Merge mining is not an option because it changes incentives and incentives are the only thing that holds Bitcoin together. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 17:56:44
That's why decentralization is important.

The burden of proof is on tether, if they are solvent and they can prove this easily then they have no reason to give anything less than a solid proof.

Running a Bitcoin node is an important task, if you're not able to setup your own node then whatever node you buy is useless.
@_date: 2018-10-17 14:35:46
I'm sorry that this happened to you and I hope this does not turn into an expensive lesson and you get your money back but   
in situations like this you cannot trust software, the burden is on you to verify that old API keys are no longer functioning.

It's not because of security, it's because bragging about money or anything is being immature.
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:04:00
You can do this with Bitcoin Core if you're cli savvy, create a new wallet and dump its keys with dumpwallet

I guess people will need to learn the hard way that coinmarketcap is not a reliable source.
@_date: 2018-10-15 16:24:57
This can't and won't be resolved but it is just a temporary problem. Bitcoin is here to replace fiat, if it fails to do so then we're going back to fiat.  
@_date: 2018-10-15 17:06:53
It does because merge mining is free to the miner, so while they're mining on the Bitcoin mainchain they can merge mine to attack the sidechain.
@_date: 2018-10-15 13:18:10
It possibly is but if it weren't do you think bitfinex would tell you so?

That is true, but to be a node operator it means to have some input, some interaction with that node. If you're just running a node you're a zombie node.  Luckily at the moment running a zombie node is not a big deal for Bitcoin because Bitcoin doesn't care about zombie nodes in determining consensus. Bitcoin determines consensus through nodes that have economic activity, not through validating nodes alone (because they all are validators).  
But imagine this scenario far into the future where almost everyone is running pre configured nodes in zombie mode. Well in this scenario the company selling the nodes is basically in charge of the Bitcoin protocol because changing the settings of the software will hardfork the network and the hardfork will have the vast majority of users which miners will be compelled to follow.  
This is basically what politics is now, people blindly give their vote away to the most charismatic politician, because that is the only way they can asses their "validity", and then that politician has all the power to do as he pleases because people voted him.  
This is a rule of life: if you don't make your own decisions someone else will make them for you.

I can easily detect from your posting patterns that you're just an alt account of the person I've initially replied to.  
That usually means I've hit the nail on the head with my reply and that angered you. Good luck with your investing just don't get bitter, you made your own choices.

That's an easy one: they want to be part of something big but they don't want to put any effort into it.  
No pain no gain, but people are hopelessly foolish.

It's just the way things are and every one of us is susceptible to this. Life is complex and we cannot know everything. We're all into this together and all of us are rooting for the same thing: a fairer world.  
All hang in there, we will get there. Do your best and don't be evil, everything else will sort itself out.
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:19:56
That is not entirely true. Running a bitcoin node is a task that takes responsibility. If you don't know what you're doing you're not going to help the network by running a node. You'll do more harm than good, you'll slow down the network and you'll be susceptible to manipulation.  
The number of nodes by itself is a useless metric. What matters is the number of nodes that are run by people that know what they are doing.
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:35:45
That's fine. Nobody cares if you get it or not. It is better that you don't get it as that gives more time to people that actually put in the effort.  
Just keep in mind the next time you hit some wall it will be because you didn't see it, not because it wasn't there.

I'm not sure if you're an actual person or some kind of Markov bot just generating sentences. If you're are an actual person take some time off the internet to consolidate your ideas. Learning is not done by reading reddit, you need to reflect on what you read.

Forking is a useful process of weeding out the lowest of the society. It is a process through which dishonest men try to take control and lose, because money talks and bullshit walks. It is easy to talk, forking allows you to stand behind your talk.

A lot of clueless people are buying pre configured nodes that they just plug in and forget about it. By doing this they give the power to the company manufacturing nodes whom can change the settings without their knowledge through firmware updates.  
In the same way people buy miners and blindly point them at some pool letting the pool making the rest of the decisions though empowering the pool owner.  
In every aspect of life where you're not capable of taking decisions by yourself you will delegate the decision making progress to a higher institution that will eventually abuse the power you gave them.   
Bitcoin is about responsibility, if you don't know what you're doing it's better to just stay out and carefully select the people that you let manage your money for you. 
  
For Bitcoin a node that just validates is almost useless. If you run a node at least connect your wallet to it if you want to make a difference.

You're operating in a limited time frame. If you set arbitrary conditions it is easy to derive the "truth" you want.  
Gold is the the oldest asset which through time has been used both as a commodity and as a currency.  
Bitcoin is digital Gold.  
You can derive the "truth" yourself from this two premises.  
The other option you have is to deny the premises but that will just show you're not really interested in knowledge but spreading your form of "truth" to others. Because if others believe your "truth" it's easier for you to live with your own ignorance of not investing in the greatest asset of your lifetime.  
Truth is temporary, seek to cultivate knowledge and you'll win more at live.

Your grandma should definitely not run a node. She can use Bitcoin without it.  
The idea behind running a bitcoin node is not that everyone should run one, it is that everyone that wants to run one should be able to with minimal resources.
