Everything you just said is wrong lol.....I'll message you a picture of my portfolio in a year, buddy. So you can see what you missed out on.
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:15:00
Pump and dump? Lol. Someone is mad they missed out. Look into it. Your .15 BTC isn't gonna make you real money
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:35:17
Yeah man college is important. I'll invite you to my graduation party in 2019
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:56:46
Alts are where its at.....I bought at $.002 and I'm more than happy. Lets just say my portfolio is at 6 figures
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:59:11
This crap is making people money
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:00:44
*BS in Computer science lol
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:59:19
I honestly did get lucky. Haha, I'll remember you if i make it. Goodluck out there man
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:51:17
Nope. My initial $4300 investment is now $39,000......I'm still processing this
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:43:10
I bet 90% of these guys don't even own a full bitcoin lol
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:28:49
Look into alts. Bought TRX at $.002 and now its at $.019 I can afford to buy 2 bitcoins now. Will I? Not sure yet....
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:05:01
You ever invest in tron?
@_date: 2018-10-09 17:37:22
Fee less for limit orders and bank withdrawals that I know of (I use it). Fees for everything else. Stop loss, market order, wire transfer, buying coins off coinbase site with cards, etc....
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:40:39
It's dropping so fast
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:55:52
Imma wait
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:03:52
He's probably a HODL. You sell at 7900 too?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:00:04
ETH AND TRON. Up over 1k now
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:04:00
I downvoted because why not
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:30:18
Jesus man 60k in debt? I got 3 semesters left and only 10k so far
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:10:33
Jesus lol. Yeah I remember seeing 5700 rip. I don't think we'll see that again. Around 6000 would be nice. This could be a good thing though? I keep telling myself to be patient 
@_date: 2017-11-06 10:35:20
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:28:12
It's over
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:13:38
Like a debit or credit card you mean? If so, yes. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:23:24
I had a problem making a GDAX even though I had a coinbase account. Turns out I needed to remove my middle name. But make sure you send front and back. Also don't crop the picture. I didn't have any problems with my license
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:50:53
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:37:53
Yeah man same. I was in class and my alerts started going off. And I came here to see what was happening. Crazy morning for sure.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:12:51
Yeah people are being stupid over this lol. I think it should hit 5600 tonight. I'm buying that
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:34:56
So simple.....i like it
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:07:00
Better be early Monday! Market opens on Monday and so do banks. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:02:41
Seriously dude......quit spamming 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:46:45
Damn that 10k can pay for my senior year of college....
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:09:57
With a bank account you have to transfer the money into your coinbase account first and wait 5-7 days. You can buy instantly with a debit or credit card but higher fees, but you lock in the price you buy at. I'm transferring the money to GDAX (connected with coinbase so it's instant transfer) cause they're low fees, and fee free when transferring your coins. You still have time to transfer money from your bank since the fork isn't until the 16th
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:07:31
Wait. Can't wait to buy cheap
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:12:25
Haha. I predicted my drop a week before this fork. We shall see
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:43:11
No.... 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:02:01
The nano looks sexy
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:08:03
We'll it happened
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:59:56
It just keeps going downnnnnn
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:40:14
Hopefully it keeps dropping the next few days.... my deposit hasn't hit my account yet :(
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:46:00
Yes. I believe the limit is like $1500 for credit cards
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:03:43
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:03:42
Jesus the dip just started! Wait
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:08:45
Damn son just dipped under 6k
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:42:49
You kidding me? This is just the beginning
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:29:34
Dang man. Just do a bank transfer into coinbase and then to GDAX (Coinbase -&gt; GDAX is instant). Fee free my friend
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:11:40
No clue. I'm leaning more towards a dip. I sold and I'm waiting for a correction.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:05:53
Same here man. Glad to see someone else thinking the same. I predicted my dip to come about a week before the fork. This fork is too hyped! So many people buying. I see a big drop coming
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:13:12
I went back to my alt coins. I'm assuming everyone else will too. So later on today it should dip
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:48:20
I expect it to dip, rise, dip more, rise, dip even more over the next couple of days
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:55:34
Same here. Did mine 2 days ago. They took the money out from my bank account last night. So I think I should have mine soon?
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:34:25
Be patient man. I personally don't care for the fork. It's way too hyped and everyone is buying bitcoin right now. The price will drop
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:21:13
We still have over a week left......its gonna happen
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:03:53
I'm buying $4300 worth so the fee was pretty big for me......everyone keeps buying cause of the fork. It's hyped and it's gonna drop soon. Like the last fork, but this I believe will be much bigger since alot more people are buying compared to the last one. I give it a couple days before the dip comes. I say it won't cross $7000 until after the fork. Who knows though!
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:14:57
Barely over. I bought into TRX really low and ETH at $300. I did invest $4300 total
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:09:13
Damn lol
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:00:32
Depends on the Bank? I have Chase. It gave me an estimate of 7 days, so I was surprised i got it today
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:05:03
I don't store my bitcoins on it. Just a way for me to convert it into real money in like an hour
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:53:28
I'll DM you next time
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:46:21
Liftoff is after the fork. Dip is coming soon
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:11:28
Once people see the price start dropping it'll be a domino effect. Can't wait
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:54:12
I noticed that too. They're usually the same
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:25:07
Lol. I opened a case over 2 weeks ago......still nothing
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:04:15
What a time to be alive am I right? Sorry about the downvote, should've actually read the post! I'm no expert either, so my feedback is no good. Anyways....not really sure what im trying to say here. I'm a bit younger than you haha. A bit about me.....im 21 years old, in college majoring in computer science (2 semesters left). I truly believe crypto is the future. I haven't really looked into the tech behind it all, but I do plan to. The possibilities are endless when it comes to programming. I'm eager to see what the future has in store for us. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:52:10
Nah. This is way too hyped. It's gonna drop bad
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:39:50
I use BitPay in the US. But you pay $10 for the card. Converts bitcoin to your currency instantly 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:40:19
Take it with your phone? And email it to yourself
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:02:09
I know but the limit was too low and high fees. Transfer was free if I did it through my bank
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:08:29
It's on GDAX. But what do I type in on the limit order? Let's say I want to buy $2000 worth of a bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:44:13
Not everyone will hold. It's about to dip under 7k right now. Once people see it drop more and more they're gonna want to sell. I'm sure alot of people wouldn't mind selling right now since many have profited. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:06:32
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:07:28
Did you wait???
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:43:05
You know banks are closed on Sundays right? So it'll be even lower tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:37:35
Have you looked at other coins? I'm up $700 in 2 days
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:56:30
Goodluck with that
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:38:34
Shit. I wanted a green one!
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:13:48
I feel so stupid. Thanks man!
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:25:37
The weekend isn't over......yes it's gonna dip more
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:29:11
Never seen it like this. I think I'm about to buy some and go to bed.....its 5am lol
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:22:55
I'm so happy lmao. I knew waiting would pay off
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:20:29
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:45:06
Never heard of it. I'm in the US that's probably why
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:20:22
I saw it go to $5600.....shouldve bought then. I'm in the same boat. If it goes to $6100-6200 I'm in
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:26:35
Lmao. Love that show
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:34:13
Last fork bitcoin dropped hard. And went back up for a new all time high. I believe this fork is too hyped....so many people buying. A drop is just waiting to happen. I could be wrong. We shall see
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:50:01
Same here lmao. The 4k part.....anyways I'm buying either today or tomorrow. As soon as it dips below 6k I'm buying
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:33:13
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:35:00
Yes thank you. I agree with OP. I think it'll drop the most like a week before the fork
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:51:03
I know the price of bitcoin.....and I'm in the US
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:38:30
This is my exact question too.....but I need bitcoin in order to buy my alt coins. So should I wait for bitcoin to drop and hope for alt coins to be low too? Or just buy today or tomorrow and buy cheap alt coins before the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:24:36
Better hope your screenshots uploaded to a cloud.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:27:05
Same. It's going to dip. I believeeeeeee. Don't really care for the fork. Like they said.....nobody knows what will happen, so I might just wait till after the fork to buy
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:09:40
Cause I'm 18 and that's a large amount to me
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:41:24
I think that already started. Everyone is buying now and these next couple of days. This fork is way too hyped. I hope it drops alot so I can buy more
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:33:11
Wait till after the fork
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:07:48
It's an authorized US seller.....and exactly what t hag guy said. It's a ledger....literally impossible to get a fake one unless you're too stupid to notice
