U have Jp Morgan, Microsoft, and other big company working on your old and without innovation for about 2 years blockchain.... I don-t think so.

your fund will be never 100% safe on a centralized exchanger . Think to buy a hardware wallet to sleep well.
In your case right now can be secure if no one know you have crypto and you have not virus on the machine.
edit: secure your main email address with 2fa now, without it hackers cannot witdraw
@_date: 2015-08-14 23:53:37
Usually I read and do not post.
Guys in every big exchanger there is market maker like me that have no fee on trade and and take advantage on big volatility in addition to giving liquidity to the exchanger.
Usually we don't focus on price but on volatility and spread.

blablabla every 3 months FUD on finex or tether....  cmon guys is always the same. anyway n thousand withdrawn and I can easielly (10min ago) withdraw 500 ETH in less than 5 min.
Anyway people only talk and never tried to trade on finex because if u are a rel trader I am sorry but u cannot find another platform complete like this ...  binance  I can laugh with 3 type of orders lol, finex have also algo type orders (ping/pong, fillor kill, trailing stop, and all your custom order for your strategy that u can create in python) and an entire framework for PRO traders and quant. , also with the options to have a VPS in the same serverfarm for fast frequency trading. a thing that other exchangers can only dream off..

guys, also if your coin come out directly from a tumbler and make sope hops the transaction are flagged as sospicius in some exchanger, don't spread misinformation. Using a mixer/tumbler will rise a yellow flag, and using wasabi is possible that your coin come out more dirty than before.... think about if u coinjoin with some drug lord that use wasabi or others coinjoin.
