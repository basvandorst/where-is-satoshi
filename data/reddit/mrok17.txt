Really cool! Thanks for sharing. 
I would want to be able to chose where the live price data is pulled from. For people who are day trading, the spreads between coinmarketcap.com and their specific exchange could be the difference between a profitable trade and a not profitable trade. Otherwise looks really cool!
I'm actually working on something as well I'd love feedback on. Mainly thinking it's for new investors looking for help getting into the space. Take a look here and feel free to share feedback!

Interesting concept. Filled it out. Assume this is still in development but look forward to seeing the progress.

Not looking to be handed money. More stable investment to diversify myself. Not a get rich quick scheme.

I've been doing my homework but I don't have the time to be on top of it. That's why I like robot advisors. Any you've seen in development that stand out?

Yeah, I've actually heard Dash mentioned a few times. Looking at the chart I kind of wish you would have told me this a month ago lol

That's why ideally I'd look for something automated. That's the idea of robo-advisors. Let an algo do it, not a dude in a suit. Drunkasshit posted something interesting, not sure what it is though.

That I'm doing, but some guidance in investing is common in other investment. Financial advisor or whatever. 
Not looking for someone to hold my hand or hold me money only give me a bit of direction here.

Any recommendations for the best place to start (not crypto fundamentals but actual coins).
