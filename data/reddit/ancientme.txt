These are legitimate criticisms. The video was just meant to be an introduction to the new software. Once the beta is released and all of the features are implemented, I plan on explaining everything for new users. Also, many people aren't aware how difficult it is to find music that Youtube won't flag as copyright. Do you have any suggestions?

The screenshot I showed in the video was what it would look like to someone viewing the blockchain (public ledger). When you view your own wallet, you can see the transactions.

Since you are booting off of the flash drives, if the drives are too cheap, the entire OS will be slow. Two mid-range 4GB flash drives would be perfect.

I heard once that data does not exist unless it is copied in three separate places. Stay offline until you encrypt your wallet once with Armory and once with Truecrypt. You can add Truecrypt to Tails by a boot command. Then, connect to the internet and upload it to secure online services. You are correct in that security does not matter if even the owner can't access his data. Keep many backups.

Truecrypt is currently installed on Tails, but disabled by default. You need to press tab immediately after starting Tails and enter “truecrypt” separated by a space from the other commands. Then, it will be available in the accessories menu. Beware that Truecrypt will be removed in future versions of Tails. See this link for more info:

You could try booting an Ubuntu live CD and using GParted to partition one USB drive to behave as two.

It also works with Ubuntu/Linux Chromium so you can run it off of a live CD.

Electrum uses a third-party list of unspent inputs instead of having you validate every transaction ever made yourself. This is convenient, but is also a security risk. Bitcoin is designed so that you should trust nobody. Consider Bitcoin Armory instead. It has great backup features like Electrum, but downloads the entire blockchain for extra security. Sync Armory overnight and then it should be just as fast as Electrum for subsequent start ups.

Physical security is far beyond digital security. It is much more likely that you download a malicious version of Armory than having someone grab your USB drive and copy a malicious version onto it. I suppose you could re-download and re-verify each time if you were nervous.
