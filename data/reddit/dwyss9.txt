@_date: 2019-07-10 06:38:35
only 45 days in Bitcoins history the price was higher than today
@_date: 2019-07-15 09:14:00
then sell with 100x long leverage
@_date: 2019-07-12 06:10:14
did it crash?
@_date: 2019-07-31 11:53:41


maybe that's why you don't have any money!

@_date: 2019-07-10 06:21:48
about what?
@_date: 2019-07-23 11:52:08
smi and btc struggeling with the 10k mark
@_date: 2018-09-21 11:19:21
yes it looks like it and it's bull season anyway
@_date: 2019-07-10 06:37:42
are not all drugs bought with bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-22 07:21:15
what if they already did?
@_date: 2019-07-12 11:42:05
it takes time to get fiat into bitcoin... banks are to slow
@_date: 2018-09-05 12:13:57
even in november 17' bullrun we had a set back from 7.4k to 5.5k
@_date: 2018-09-19 11:32:51
anyone seeing the similarity with the 200ema to 2015 right this time of the year?
@_date: 2018-09-18 15:03:10
100% with you!
@_date: 2018-09-19 06:10:49


ja, bärndütsch nid eifach aber gmüätläch :-)
@_date: 2018-09-10 06:33:34
thx man
@_date: 2018-09-18 05:58:29
what about the volume?
@_date: 2018-09-09 20:29:51
is there a audiobook around?
@_date: 2018-09-21 09:00:50
@_date: 2018-09-18 14:03:34

@_date: 2018-09-18 06:01:51


@_date: 2018-09-03 08:59:35

@_date: 2018-09-19 06:09:20
I like living in Bern :-) hopefully i can pay everything with btc soon and can get rid of my bankaccount (postfinance)
@_date: 2018-08-29 20:45:46
did you sell?
@_date: 2018-08-29 20:47:21
and rise in nov because of bakkt
@_date: 2018-05-04 15:19:56
yes but better than fiat anyway! there you have to trust a entire corrupt goverment and the value of the banknote are backed by nothing
@_date: 2018-05-30 07:25:37
that's why i want to go long
@_date: 2018-08-29 20:43:54
exactly my thougts
@_date: 2018-08-15 18:48:18
two years i doubt, halvening is in less than two years
@_date: 2018-05-30 14:13:25
thx, you probably don't know anything about  **price elasticity of demand** 
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:39:02
use a password to protect your wallet
@_date: 2018-05-04 15:15:53
no the private keys are on the banknote and not in their hands ... probably
@_date: 2018-08-07 19:58:32
wtf are you turt talking about?
@_date: 2018-05-25 07:34:23
where do you get that from... just F.U.D look at the Mt Gox cold wallet link i posted below!
@_date: 2018-05-14 12:57:53
you truly belive that 700k btc are traided daily? 6000 BTC can have a huge effect on the price if the sell of is timed well and at market prise...
@_date: 2018-05-17 14:47:57
YES! It's almost like bitcoin is going to its knees to jump even higher...
@_date: 2018-05-30 07:51:09
but not today :P
@_date: 2018-05-29 12:54:26
so you are comparing btc to potatoes? nice... 
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:01:17

@_date: 2018-05-30 09:02:20
@_date: 2018-05-04 14:24:30

@_date: 2019-03-19 09:50:11

@_date: 2019-03-06 06:49:16

@_date: 2019-03-01 06:06:11

@_date: 2019-03-31 12:25:42
or saying it goes to 100k like every bull a year ago, like every bear shouts 1k3
@_date: 2019-11-14 07:51:08

@_date: 2019-11-27 08:02:04

@_date: 2019-11-21 09:43:37
good luck with buying lol
@_date: 2019-03-21 21:24:39

@_date: 2019-11-14 07:55:20
sounds like a good idea to me, but don't listen to stranger on the net...

@_date: 2019-08-14 09:02:56


@_date: 2018-06-04 19:54:58

@_date: 2018-06-12 06:19:17
yeah right... \^\^
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:52:48

@_date: 2018-06-14 06:23:05


I am waiting to 5k to dca
@_date: 2018-06-14 18:39:34
nice buy in price
@_date: 2018-06-04 13:02:25
i'm not superstitious either, but if you look at the chart it's pretty much lining up to the 6th and around one or two days, the past few months.
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:26:20
i dont care about loosing fiat! i want to drive btc down for what sick reason i might have ... my point is with enough money and otc is easy possible
@_date: 2018-06-05 09:01:56
@_date: 2018-06-13 07:31:36
im guessing they are making a adress for every customer?
@_date: 2019-10-14 08:36:00
no wrong
@_date: 2019-08-07 08:55:20


yes this would be +13% it only count's daily close
@_date: 2018-06-13 07:33:13
yes and probably exchanges sell bitcoins that don't even exists.
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:03:42
is this all you got? muahahahaha
@_date: 2018-06-14 18:41:37
once i said we will never see btc prices under 10k :)
@_date: 2019-08-25 20:43:36
i can say with almost 100% guarantee, we will hit 100k before one million
@_date: 2019-08-02 08:50:31
good call!
@_date: 2019-10-14 12:30:37
bitcoin is no company... think bigger!
@_date: 2019-08-30 12:46:57
yor are pretty smart
@_date: 2019-08-21 05:53:07
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:31:05
no one buys or sells now and waits for the 6th, and then the big crash/moonshot?
@_date: 2019-08-05 11:12:10
new to you? only the price can be manipulated in $terms, not btc itself, do your homework
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:30:09
that make no sense
@_date: 2019-10-15 09:13:00

Scott who?
@_date: 2019-10-02 12:48:13
we all know how this fight ended... lol
@_date: 2019-10-22 20:15:09
mhh C seems to be the only right answer
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:51:16
change of sentiments \-\&gt; if its gone down, it will go up and visa\-versa! some predicting a bull run starting the 6th
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:27:24
better untether before its to late!
@_date: 2018-06-21 11:48:45
i did actually see the match :-)
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:24:30
not a lot more, yes
@_date: 2019-10-14 19:26:23
aaaaaaaaand she is gone....
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:21:33
7k is not &gt; than 6750 rn??
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:28:03
i see no volume?
@_date: 2019-08-15 19:13:05
not even hawking knew what is in the future possible but it needed no time traveler to know epstein would not survive, in fact many said he will not make the trial
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:26:54
at the end i have even more btc 
@_date: 2019-10-21 08:42:40


@_date: 2019-10-29 12:28:10
1W time frame is bullish af
@_date: 2019-10-14 19:40:20
about 12.5 btc each 10 min if you can shut down all other miners
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:25:17
i dont care about loosing fiat! i want to drive btc down for what sick reason i might have ... my point is with enough money and otc is easy possible
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:41:53
what happend?
@_date: 2019-10-09 07:57:41
looks like us dept clock to me
@_date: 2018-06-13 08:03:07
yes, but this might be right, look at the wall street cheat sheet, it look like we are about to bottom out and are in depression phase. we need just to go a little lower (i hope for 5k to load heavy my slaughtered bags)
@_date: 2018-06-12 06:25:52
I have to admit your way is better than mine, thank you for your explanations and in the end we all know that bitcoin will finally rise again. Even if regulations come, the market will still be manipulated, but they cannot manipulate the tech!
@_date: 2018-06-04 11:27:26
@_date: 2019-10-15 12:20:38
delay possible
@_date: 2019-08-19 09:03:14


which launch?
@_date: 2018-06-12 06:18:20
6750 \+ 5&amp; is roughly 7k or am I wrong??? ok you are right: 7,0875k you made your point, thx with that. And why otc, because you don't affect any volume (its not reported and not counting as trading volume overall and its not affecting any price)
@_date: 2019-10-14 19:41:51
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:48:59

copied text from a guy from netherland:
here is my 2 cent about institutional money FORGET ABOUT IT
 
they cannot join the game because btc is beyond their manipalative controling instruments   
That is why btc will skip institutional step 
The next step however is around the corner
The black Swan is already born but not been spotted YET 
Let me explain
The world central banks are all connected but olso divided in different camps you have the BIG3 players and the 
BIG5 dependants
Controled by BIS via IMF
Imagene all sitting around a table looking at btc their biggest thread But also their only alvation 
BIG3 players
Londen and the yews have the spider network 
Usa and the arabs their petro dollar
China and russia gods money
Big 5 dependance
South Amerika
The dependent 5 are up til now controlled by big 3 and 
WHEN not if the viat bullshit run its final course  
More printing will happen the big 3 players wil be defending their position and during that fight 
South Amerika will be the first that ambrace btc out off NEED
And than the shit will hit the fan and every country  with some wealth LEFT  will be jumping on the reamaining scraps off btc
