How do you process [this](

That's a good question!! That's what people asked when they did that.
This is from about 15 days ago -

mtgox is not the local police station.
individuals giving out justice is still "extra-judicial" and is still considered illegal. Vigilantism is also considered illegal.

as someone between nerd and user, i clicked on "help" that provided no help whatsoever.
@_date: 2011-06-21 14:12:48
oh, so it is not just the email address, but also the IP number.

to follow this line of thought: is the restriction only applicable to USD or Euro? or, does the government restrict any such conversion?
If she sends a cheque outside the country, will that be honoured?
@_date: 2011-08-12 19:26:00
oh yes, i agree. But others dont seem to realize the reality on the ground (in 3rd world countries)

i already got 0.02, so i cant get 0.001 again.

what's wrong with current market rate?
that is how investors work - some buy as prices are falling to average out their holdings. some buy for intra-day trading.
You quoted only a part of what he said - "Then, right after selling them all, I bought more. **Later, I sold them all again**. I tripled my money again"
Also, "I have told many of my friends and they are now interested in **investing in Bitcoin**"

maybe he is diversified. what if he put only 10% of his money in BTC (highly improbable, anyway).
@_date: 2011-07-01 21:48:33
you didn't notice his username, huh?

0.04 - what percentile is my wealth in?

If  she's going to keep her money as data then she had better learn about data. There is no way around it.

I got 0.04 cents for free, i couldn't use it anywhere since all websites that trade require atleast 1 BTC for registration and asked for my bank details. Couldn't/Wouldn't satisfy either condition, so I just let it sit in my wallet. I'll be using it as a canary to see if my computer is compromised in any way.
@_date: 2011-06-14 07:45:26


sounds very much like the amway-haters and anti-goldquest people.
@_date: 2011-06-20 16:44:58
if that is the case, MtGox should release the details to the police and not to the "internet gangbangers"
@_date: 2011-06-17 03:27:36
something others perceive as valuable, and is bloody easy to steal.
@_date: 2011-06-24 16:06:28
He seems to be a savvy investor - he used bitcoins as an investment vehicle rather than as currency :(
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:14:39
i saw my username on the list, but they didn't send me any warning email.
@_date: 2011-06-07 17:19:37
definitely, make things user-friendly. if something is not obvious for my mum, i definitely will have some alternative. If we went like *sigh* windows, which loads with a default setting, and "power users" can modify it to what they want, more users will adopt it.
@_date: 2011-06-07 16:51:38


banks convert it into local date and time.


there we go again, ridiculing users for not understanding the obvious
@_date: 2011-08-12 18:58:05


Actually, that is the problem in developing countries
This is one of the choice of phones in 3rd world countries, including India:
we do have SMS banking, but all transactions are carried out on a central server rather than through individual computer-like phones.
The cost of that phone (and comparable phones from Samsung, Motorola) etc is about 2000 rupees (45 dollars?) The cost of even the cheapest Android is about 35000 rupees (~775 dollars)
If bitcoin penetration has to be as much as mobile penetration, then transactions would have to be done at a server with these phones giving out only SMS commands and receiving confirmations.
Also, 3g/4g or such conveniences you guys take for granted is really pisspoor.

sorry for your loss

Having experienced money transfers, payments and associated fee in both* India and USA, I think the main gripe of some bitcoin users is the time taken, extremely high fee the banks charge and how limited electronic and internet banking in USA compared to a third world country like India. 
*corrected not to both

why VAT exempt?
