No, you will just see more throwaway sock puppet accounts(like yours) wine, moan, and complain for the miners because they won't profit from as many transaction fees. Keep wasting energy trying to impose your phony narrative though.

Virtually the same as Bitcoin in the sense you can transfer value. The only working DAPP i know if is [EtherDetla]( a decentralized exchange.

Which the Fed prints money to buy... Nobody with brains buys T-bills with their own money anymore.


They'll only swap to crypto when their fiat currency is inflated to nothing and they'll have absolutely no other choice.


No the problem is the fiat currency which enables them to be reckless in the first place just like giving more drugs to an addict.

Nice try but no.  Bitcoin miners require more and more electricity in their competition to over secure the network.

Can you please explain?
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:18:13
People aren't going to want the IOUs. They're going to want the real underlying asset in the new age which is Bitcoin. Banks got away with lending IOUs in the past because gold wasn't easily portable and divisible.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:57:41
Just like any new asset, Bitcoin is going to have a volatile price until more people save in it than speculate in it. It's gradually getting there. If Bitcoins appreciate in value then the loan will fail. If more fail then lenders will negotiate better deals with loan customers.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:50:19
Insanely insanely insanely... Exaggerating much?
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:59:28
Then why didn't they ever pass a budget between 2009 and 2015? Because they didn't wanted to get away with more defecit dpending without getting politically scathed. You're right though. Republicans like deficit spending, but Democrats aren't any better.
BTW, you're revealing your ineptitude at grasping economics.  Higher taxes ultimately don't generate more revenue because they disincentivise people to work harder. You might say so what.  The rich have all the money so why would they care if they pay more? Just soak them.  The rich don't  become or stay rich without applying some dort of cost benefit analysis to everything they do or counting their pennies. They will absolutely change their behavior in response to higher costs in their lives.  
And when the government gets their cut, most or all of it will go to make interest payments on the debt that will never be paid off because of fractional reserve banking, ie not enough money existing in the economy to pay the debt + interest. If it doesn't  go towards the debt, it will be used to pay for projects that are politically(not economically) profitable so congressmen can get re-elected again.  Either way, that money was coersively stolen from the public to begin with which can never be beneficial to the economy.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:13:47
Propaganda alert. Inflation means lower interest rates and therefor less incentive to save money(hoarding in your language). If that savings is in a bank, the banks invest it in businesses  so they can acquire the working capital to produce more goods and services or enhance(innovate) upon existing production. That's why having a deflationary money supply is good. It wrings out malinvestment in the economy and allocates money where it's needed the most.
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:14:03
So he should only give analysis on one  perspective?
@_date: 2018-03-24 16:09:16


Then why didnt the Dems pass a budget from 2009 to 2015? Because they like defecit spending and they didnt want to to take as much political heat for it. In practice, they support defecit spending just as much as the GOP.


Technically you're correct but my point still stands.

Why did you respond to me 4 times?
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:15:30
No it can't and that's a feature of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:01:20


Why is that?
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:16:13
You can earn interest on Bitcoins deposited at a bank. The bank just can't use fractional reserves.
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:08:12
Well I can understand one reason Bitcoin would be popular there.  The government can't confiscate it!
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:28:39
Okay well I thought by IOUs you meant currency loaned out that is backed by Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 08:29:03
It always perplexes me why we have lefties like you on this sub though. If crypto is mass adopted in the future, their won't be any deficit spending. Also if the money supply stays tight, people are going to be less fond of handing it over to the government.
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:15:45
How could regulation possibly help?
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:26:31
Because the investment could appreciate more than savings/reserves. People need food, clothes, and shelter, etc.  People value those goods more than sitting money.

You could make the same argument about Bitcoin in 2013 or 2014. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:41:01
Because the government didn't attain consent. It was theft.

No but who's to say the trend won't continue?
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:36:27


Nothing if it isn't carried out by the government. Peercoin produces 1% PoS interest/inflation every year.


So what? You're pretending like low-interest rates don't change people's behavior. They likely extended their margin because artificially low-interest rates encouraged them to relax their standards. It was the central bankers which facilitated these incentives. You're just using commercial banks as a scapegoat. 


Okay, it's obvious to me you're just trolling or that you have an agenda. Have a nice life. I'll be blocking you for now on.

Wow there sure is a contingent if anti bitcoin trolls out there. The transaction volume has steadily been increasing over the past 10 years. Mass adoption doesn't happen over night.

And so does Bitcoin. It's an incorruptible ledger which can seamlessly transfer value around the world.

3 day stochastic is oversold though as well as the weekly. Yes I know tech analysis is seen as voodoo science but just [check the stoch rsi track record]( Tomorrow might not be a bloody Sunday.
EDIT: Plus we're in an area with heavy support.  Also, if you look at the [weekly log chart]( and compare the 2013 and 2014 bubbles with the 2017 bubble, you'll notice some differences. One, the 2017 bubble took 25% more time to reach its peak and therefore spent more time maturing(so to speak) into the current price range. Two, the 2017 bubble was proportionally 23% smaller which suggests there will be less of a correction. That's just my take on it.
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:00:38
Of course you don't trade language. My point is that it's a *non-tangible and non-proprietary tool like Bitcoin. 
1929 , 2008, and all the financial bubbles in between were caused by the artificial creation of money by the central banks, ie government-sanctioned cartels, and not by the lack of regulation. Regulation only opens the door to more corruption through regulatory capture by the powers at be.

Both of those guys sort of nodded to each other after Janet claimed the Federal Reserve was the most transparent bank in the world and then the kid on the right held up the sign.  
Correction: I think it was actually the guy in the white suit who held up the sign.
