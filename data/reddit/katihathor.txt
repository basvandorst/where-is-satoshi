just go to to get feedback on your build idea before committing to the purchase.  I used them and was quite happy with the results

i just buy bitcoins when i need to spend them on stuff...luckily my order over the weekend was already shipped out before the big crash.
@_date: 2015-01-08 01:00:45
apparently you think that QR code = private key.  a QR code can be anything, usually a website URL.

I still have a wallet from 2008 somewhere, but finding the backup has proven elusive.
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:48:10
I'm running Bitcoin version v0.8.5-beta
And Windows 8.1 Technet Enterprise Evaluation
The transactions seem to be hung locally instead of pending via the network.  I've disabled Windows Defender and Windows Firewall but it doesn't seem to affect anything.
The first transaction I tried was to buy some reddit gold, and that broke, but I thought it was because it hadn't downloaded the blockchain completely yet.  When I tried buying reddit gold again after the blockchain completed, it went through fine.  I had about 70mBTC and then someone sent me 18mBTC and 55mBTC and both of those seemed to go thru just fine.  But then when I sent out 130mBTC last night it got stuck in limbo.
I've uploaded the wallet file here:  
It's encrypted with a pretty strong passphrase, and only has 137mBTC in it so I kind of doubt it would be worth anyone's resources to try to crack my passphrase, so if anyone wants to look at the wallet file to see if they can debug it, I would appreciate the help.

I recommend not doing too high of a volume too fast.  If you start moving 10's of 1000's a day in and out of your account, don't be surprised if they shut you down or require a large ~~escrow~~ reserve.
@_date: 2013-04-30 23:30:44
yeah, but maybe it will be true for him if BTC hit a couple grand a coin or something.
@_date: 2013-03-21 07:23:16
thanks, that's a good point :)
@_date: 2013-12-25 00:05:23
I tried that and it didn't help unfortunately.
@_date: 2013-04-28 21:28:52
the code is not the issue you have to worry about; it is getting a bank account that you can accept frequent, large deposits in, and having a hosting plan that can deal with DDOS attacks without your web host terminating your hosting service.
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:13:27
i still have bitcoins in their system that they haven't bothered to send me, in spite of it having nothing to do with the USD issue that they're having
@_date: 2013-03-26 09:30:36
your reply makes the most sense.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:20:23
Glad I could help!
Also check out the subreddit if this is why you're trying to be anonymous ;)
@_date: 2013-04-30 06:19:56
Yeah i watch TYT fairly regularly, it is odd that they haven't talked much about bitcoin, especially given the big bubble that just happened, and how even after the bubble burst it has stabilized pretty high.
@_date: 2013-04-28 04:28:41
fractions of mBTC.  less than pennies basically.
@_date: 2013-04-28 20:25:52
more of a calculated risk in that case.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:46:23
I don't understand what is so hard about riding the wave out?  Just because it drops in value, even by half, why sell at a loss?  Just hold onto it til it inevitably jumps back up again...might take a month or a year but no reason to expect that you'll lose all your money.  I guess people were investing money they needed to pay their bills for the month and freaked out.
@_date: 2013-12-25 01:26:18
I added it to block chain and recovered 99mBTC but idk where the other 38mBTC disappeared to.  But losing 38 is better than losing 130.  Haven't really messed with pywallet yet; do you think that could help me locate and recover the missing 38?
@_date: 2013-12-24 23:06:45
okay nice, thank you, i shall try that
@_date: 2013-10-03 09:26:25
i donated to lavabit's defense fund around the time they got shut down...not rich enough to do it again now.

I'm really glad that you're getting so many tips, and am incredibly grateful for your contribution to the reddit community.  
Unfortunately, I am not set up to bitcoin tip, but I do wish to thank you.
@_date: 2013-03-25 13:54:32
I printed up something that says LocalTill, LLC with an account number and a dollar amount.  How does it know which bitfloor account to get routed to?  Or do they just have a lot of account numbers and any deposits to that specific one is reserved for me until this big bold "make your deposit by" time?
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:40:06
I like bitfloor and don't like MTG.
@_date: 2013-03-26 09:53:52
thanks for your input
@_date: 2013-05-01 04:47:32
they did mention something about the guy selling his house for BTC but that's about it.
@_date: 2013-03-28 10:17:54
Damn it was at $62 on saturday ... I bought 1.07BTC for ~$80 on Monday, which I used to make a purchase, and now that's worth over $100, had I saved it for a couple of days I could have spent less than one BTC
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:52:56
no, i don't have an account with them and it worked fine.  you just fill out the deposit slip and hand it to the teller with money.  i went to the business teller line since the deposit is into a business account, and didn't have to wait in line as long.
@_date: 2013-03-25 23:13:04
Well I made the deposit at BoA and it showed up in bitfloor.  Right now it is at 79 whereas mtgox is a little over 75.  Hopefully it will drop a bit so I can pick up the coins at 75?
@_date: 2013-03-26 17:52:35
what is interesting is that they couldn't even avoid mentioning reddit in the article.  lmao.
@_date: 2013-03-21 05:04:37
wow thanks, that found the wallet.dat for me :)  never heard of that tool but it's great! now to see if i can get at the coins...
@_date: 2013-03-21 07:23:06
it does seem to be reading the old, unencrypted wallet fine.  it's been synchronizing with the network for a long time though.
@_date: 2013-04-30 08:18:03
because i didn't find out that bitfloor was down until yesterday.  
i'm not really worried about the money, because it really wasn't that much.  
what concerns me is that the best exchange service i was using, recommending to others, and personally trusted just poofed out of existence.  if i get my money back out then i'll feel better.  but otherwise it's making me a bit reserved to spend a lot of time and effort educating others on the virtues of bitcoin when there are still so many kinks to work out.
@_date: 2013-05-01 06:20:57


i've tried this in both qt-bitcoin and armory and both of them complained that i didn't set the minimum fee and refused to initiate the transfer.  also the addresses don't seem to be compatible across the different clients.  so i'm still trying to figure this out.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:35:40
LOL, yeah I got screwed out of $2 million during the dotcom boom.  I still feel bad for those who dumped their life savings into BTC at $100+/coin, but live and learn.  Not worth getting suicidal over money, money is never going away and you can always earn more.  Win some and lose some.
@_date: 2013-03-26 17:45:13
if the question i posed was easily answered by a google search i wouldn't have posted it here
@_date: 2013-04-30 08:00:36
aww thanks, i appreciate it :) 
it's all good; lost opportunity cost is not nearly as painful as losing hard cash.  
while i'm too broke to invest money directly into bitcoin -- and feel like the mining ship has been sailing away -- i do think that i may still be able to cash in by creating a bitcoin-centric online service.  i'm highly skilled in web development, and hosting prices are a drop in the bucket these days, so i can probably come up with something profitable on a shoe-string budget...i'm still mulling over some ideas.
@_date: 2013-04-29 07:20:34
your best bet is to set aside most of your income as a reserve initially, and then keep open and clear communication with your bank.  you're in a high-risk category, and at some point the bank is going to get anxious about it as transaction volume and amounts increase ... so the best best is to be prepared to purchase a large CD and use that as a collateral/reserve to keep the risk department off your back.
from personal experience, once you start pushing a lot of money through your bank account it starts raising red flags.  because if it seems like you're "too successful" then their risk department will get all finicky.
granted, cash is a lot less risky than credit cards, given that chargebacks aren't possible, and my perspective is from pushing large amounts of money through a merchant account.  however, i've had to deal with account freezes and closures before, with ambiguous excuses justified by the patriot act.  grow too big, too fast, and they'll start wondering if you're laundering money.
keep meticulous records and be prepared to show the bank exactly what you're doing with specificity on the drop of a dime.  seek legal counsel.  and save save save, so that you have negotiating power when the inevitable time comes that the bank starts getting finicky.  
the risk department's tune changes once you're willing and able to mitigate their risk by offering a reserve.  they only care about making money, not about what you're doing (as long as it is legal), and they're only going to be queasy because they think they might lose a lot of money.  but they don't want to lose your business either, so you have to set up your accounts in such a way that the numbers work for their seemingly arbitrary risk analysis systems.  what those numbers might be will depend on a lot of factors that i lack the knowledge of to suggest ballparks for you.  but it is in your best interest to figure out what those numbers are, long before your account inevitably starts raising red flags.
anyway, i wish you the best of luck.  i hope i've been a bit helpful.  
@_date: 2013-03-28 16:28:57
well how many of the 600 had ~$5500+ worth of BTC in their wallet, vs buying a bunch of BTC shortly before the sale?
@_date: 2013-05-15 10:08:44
no, i heard of them/used them long before i knew they had anything to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-28 21:46:17

lmfao, the top result on google links to this thread.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:39:07
yeah, i just wanted to play around a bit with bitcoin, so i didn't bother much with anonymity (as in i used my real email address and didn't bother to mask my IP).  i was quite happy with how anonymous and easy it was.  also the fees were quite low.  
contrast that to moneygram, which i used to buy bitcoin in the past ... those guys want everything, including social security number and current occupation, which is totally ridiculous for simply sending cash, and then it costs like $12 for amounts less than $100.  such an annoying hassle, and i don't like that kind of info about me stored in a database somewhere.
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:12:10
that's pretty cool, can you order from your site or is it only through the phone app?
@_date: 2013-04-30 23:21:48
well to be fair he claims to be a bitcoin billionaire, which i know isn't actually possible given that the entire market cap is close to that.  but i'm guessing he has plenty of BTC to throw around.

yeah someone helped me figure it out, thanks :)
@_date: 2013-03-26 17:46:09
a redditor using digg?  for shame
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:09:57
bitfloor.com doesn't ask you for anything besides an email address.  If you want total anonymity, use Tor and register a secure email account like from lavabit.com
Then deposit to one of their BofA accounts, and buy the coin using bitfloor's market.
No personal info whatsoever.
@_date: 2013-10-03 09:45:51
I'm frankly pretty flabbergasted that people seem to think that the only alternative they have now is to rush off to the ghetto to find some shady street corner dealer selling substances of unknown quality.

Well they should at least be able to launch Bitcoin-Qt and look through the transaction data?  It doesn't ask me for any passcode info until I try to send money to someone.
@_date: 2013-04-29 00:23:07
the main issue with running an exchange is having a bank that will work with you as you have frequent, large deposits going into your account.
generally, the only way for this to be viable for the long term is to have a large amount of cash sitting in reserve that is controlled by the bank.
@_date: 2013-05-15 10:01:21
that's nice, what about the bitcoin that he hasn't bothered returning, which has nothing to do with his USD being seized?
@_date: 2013-05-01 02:47:49


if fees are optional, than how does one send without a fee?  if i set the fee to 0 on qt-bitcoin it refuses to even send certain transactions.  I'm looking around to see if I can find better clients that perhaps are more geared towards enterprise applications.


I had a wallet with multiple addresses that each had individual money in them, and then I sent coins from the wallet and it seemed to pool the funds together somehow.  So this is why I'm confused.


Yeah I'm planning to always display the balance in mBTC.  I want it to be as transparent as possible.  My blockchain wallet shows BTC in big bold letters and then the approximate market value in USD in smaller print in a softer font.  So I was thinking of maybe doing something like that, since I have no intention of becoming an exchange.
@_date: 2013-06-01 23:20:32
yeah it would be nice to have bitcoin-only transactions, but in reality the majority of stuff you can buy with bitcoin is priced based on its value in fiat currency rather than bitcoin for the sake of bitcoin.
i think this needs to change for bitcoin to be widely adopted.  If you buy stuff in GBP you can just spend GBP and people market services in GBP, you don't have to look at how much GBP is worth if it were converted euros on a particular day (or in BTC case a particular time in the same day)
@_date: 2013-04-30 06:24:07
I did a withdraw request over 24h ago for the rest of my BTC that was still in there, and it still is pending with nothing hitting the blockchain.  I sure hope that they release my coin.
@_date: 2013-12-25 01:25:24
I added it to block chain and recovered 99mBTC but idk where the other 38mBTC disappeared to.  But losing 38 is better than losing 130.
@_date: 2013-12-25 00:06:30
okay i think i'll give that a try next.
@_date: 2013-04-30 06:14:28
imagine watching videos on youtube in 2009 about bitcoin mining, and setting a side a couple grand to build a mining rig...but instead, investing in a different business venture that didn't pan out...and not bothering to mine any coins on the side in the meantime because it seemed like it wasn't worth mining without a decent rig.
then re-discovering bitcoin in early 2011 when the price hit $1 and getting excited about it again, even doing some mining for a couple weeks, and then deciding to integrate it into the shopping cart of your online business, but never getting around to it, and forgetting about it again.
then re-discovering it in march, and getting all excited about the ASIC's coming out, and getting ready to buy a jalepeno, but waiting too long so the price doubles and you can't afford it.  
meanwhile, getting your affluent friend interested in mining, and talking to him a couple weeks later and him casually mention that he bought a couple 60GH ASIC's when he was drunk, because it "sounded interesting", and mentioning that he was considering "getting a couple friends together" to set up a "real" mining operation.
@_date: 2013-05-06 06:16:22
they still owe me coins i tried to withdraw a week ago.  it's making me anxious about using bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-24 23:16:12
That actually deleted the wallet file; thankfully I had just made a backup prior to running the command, so I'm not any worse off than i was before.  but it didn't fix anything :(
@_date: 2013-05-01 06:09:18


That just isn't true.  You must be confusing selling tweets with selling followers or selling accounts.  Selling tweets is perfectly acceptable:


I've read dozens of pages on the bitcoin wiki and i still don't understand bitcoin as well as i'd like.  that is why i'm posing questions here.


thanks, i will take a look.
@_date: 2013-03-28 14:22:38
honestly I think that the ASIC sales from avalon the other day are what's driving up the price.  hopefully it can stabilize though, the large fluxuations are a bit scary
@_date: 2013-05-01 07:51:46
thanks, i'll give that a try :)

@_date: 2013-04-30 22:58:07
please.  nobody who is tech savvy enough to use bitcoin is going to be put off by calling the developers "hackers".  
now if the articles were saying that "anonymous" created bitcoin, you might have an argument.  
pretty much every internet entreprenuer with a billion dollar company has been referred to as a hacker at one point or another.
and people like steve wozniak have been publicly called hackers for decades now, yet nobody is scared to buy a mac because OMG HACKERS.
just not seeing how this is going to freak everyone out like you think it is.

I've restarted Bitcoin-Qt several times.  I've not tried restarting Windows though...do you really think restarting Windows would help?  I'm in the middle of slow-formatting a hard drive that has been at it for like 30 hours so I kind of would prefer not to interrupt that process unless you really think a Windows reboot would fix the problem.  I suppose I could copy the bitcoin info to a virtualbox machine and try running bitcoin~qt on virtualbox and see if that helps with anything?

well when I read an article saying it took a "nosedive" and then i look at the chart and it's dipped down to where it was *less than a month ago* then i'm gonna say that's a big win....a "nosedive" is when it goes from 266 to 100 in a day, not when it goes from 150 to 125, lmao
