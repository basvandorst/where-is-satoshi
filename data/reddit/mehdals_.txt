I like those, Very Nice!  Bitcoins is definitely better than both Gold and $!  I really feel shirts, apparel, stickers and anything else with bitcoin on them will help spread the news and word on this amazing advancement in tech. Not everyone is on reddit or even the internet and these are physical ways of getting Bitcoin, a digital item noticed in the real physical world.

Anybody have thoughts on the sudden jolt of increase, is this all hype on the Lightning Network or is someone pumping it up?

I've a actually found an app you watch ads and it pays a 3-100 bits per.

I have been trying to find small ways to spread the word of Bitcoin as well in whatever means possible. I setup a tshirt shop to help spread awareness and gain funds for buying more Bitcoin. Maybe I need to make a shirt that says "Do you accept Bitcoin?"

It's the suppose to be Eye of Providence on the back of the dollar bill, maybe I missed the mark on it.

Thanks! It's a fun way to contribute to the community and spread the word.

That's kinda what I had in mind but didn't want to bring in full conspiracy theories to the table, figured it represented banks as a whole fairly well so its the symbol i went with I will definitely have to add a euro and other currencies tho with the response this one is getting! Thanks for looking everyone!
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:25:31
Thanks I'll go there
