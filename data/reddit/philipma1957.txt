I think it is over .  Or poof up in smoke!

So No ETC    and  No ETH missing correct?
All my funds were in deposit wallets. Not a crazy high amount around 50 ETH and  55 ETC.  I was giving margin funding. Any idea of how long to access these funds? I ask because if intact  access should not be too long.  Obvious that my small accounts  are not your highest priority  but you had some very big ETC and ETH players I am sure they are concerned.

I was able to sign in and look up my stats.
Eth dropped from 50 to 31
Etc dropped from  55 to 35
I now have 239 BFX

this is a big point.  My 55etc and 50eth  were in deposit account for margin.  So  lets say I  have not seen them for a few hours  before the hack  how do I know if  they were on loan or if the loan dropped off.  The eth absolutely had more then 20 coins in deposit and no loans offered so I certainly truly should see at least 20 eth back.
But I had an 5 eth loan  for 18 days.  the other 25 eth coins I am not sure.   So did the 18 day borrower decide to end that loan of 5eth  I do not know.  I also know that is a big incentive for lying to me about that loan.  All small scale in my case but we all know some had  1000 eth on loan  or 10000 eth on loan and lets pretend the loan ended 15 minutes before the hack  that 10000 eth should go to the deposit account  well good luck with that happening. As for the etc I think all 54.78 etc were on loan.  But I last looked 2 hours before the hack and maybe  all 54.78 etc were sitting.
I had do auto margin so the coin did not go back on loan.
I am a small guy and I can deal with a small loss but the lack of proper procedures was a problem since 120,000 btc in a flash is not good.

It is true I was lucky to be in this very small. And many people are looking at huge losses. I feel for them quite  a bit.

Fast question  to all reading and posting.  What do you think your chances are of any funds of yours to be recovered?
  My 55 ETC and MY 51 ETH  are peanuts to many reading here.  My were in deposit accounts and were providing margin funding  so I put my recovery chances at 50%.

Looking for a time to see the site open for viewing.
As I said earlier My losses are not going to be big as I did have only 54.78 in ETC and 50 in ETH.  On deposit accounts only. At lease 20 of the ETH was not on loan last I looked and  in the ETC case 25.00 was on loan.
This is peanuts compared to others but I still would like to know how much is gone and how much is left.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:10:15
So my small deposits of 50 ETH and 55 ETC  which were providing  margin loans  should be good. Correct?
My holdings are  worth about 700 in USD.  Not much compared to others. I also used 2fa  and did not sign up for bitgo. So How does this affect me and others that only used 2fa  for protection. In theory since bitgo would not have been involved with us.

  Good point  he is working hard  at putting out fires.  My losses will not be much as I was well under 1k  (700 usd) when this happened.
I hate to think he is doing his all to help and is being betrayed by upper management. Still no sign of the exchange opening  which is not so encouraging to me.

 dear   zanetackett  you have told us  the site will be up for viewing 2 or 3 days in a row,

As i've mentioned elsewhere, we are not overlooking this situation and have discussed it already. We haven't made a final decision but will have an update for you tomorrow.
