All anecdotes with poor to zero correlation to the actual events.  
Sean Carroll sums this up well with two options as to what we can believe about it:
1. "Everything we think we understand about the behavior of matter and energy is wrong, in a way that has somehow escaped notice in every experiment ever done in the history of science. Instead, there are unknown mechanisms allow information in the brain to survive in the form of a blob of spirit energy, which can then go start talking to other blobs of spirit energy, but only after death, except sometimes even before death."
2. "Physics is right. And people under stress sometimes have experiences that seem real but aren’t."
We don't completely understand the exact mechanism by which consciousness happens in humans, but relying on explanations that ignore all our current knowledge is going down the wrong path.

INTJ, but everyone I have ever met that takes the Myers Briggs seriously is an idiot.

Stupid, I agree, but a calculated stupidity.  You knew the odds and you went for it.  OTOH, I bought 3 BTC worth of alt-garbage based upon troll box goading, which I consider even dumber than your loss.

I read a bit of your story yesterday.  Having not yet tried any BTC gambling, I decided to try Just-Dice after reading about your loss.  So now, I'm wondering why I would ever choose to gamble any other way.  That is *so* much different than any type of casino gambling I have ever done. I love it. I turned 0.75 BTC into 2.2 BTC, but now I am frightened about how much I love using that site.  I have a bad feeling about knowing this site exists.  
My question is:  Given the fact that you aren't a gambler and this kind of betting is far outside your normal behavior, is the seduction of that site and that type of betting what lead you to making such a large bet?

You've made a humorously wrong choice of homophone.

The magnitude of the OP loss made me want to see where and why that happened.  For me, I think it is similar to gawking at the damage from a train-wreck.  I was compelled to go see for myself.

Yeah, I see your point.  I'm only driving a Yugo into the wreckage, though.

If I leave bitcoin core wallet open on my desktop computer, does that mean I am running a full node?

99.99% is probably a little hyperbolic at this point, but it isn't far from that percentage. 
Andreas is really good at explaining key points without being too verbose.

Whether made from experience or just a casual understanding of doing prison time, this comment made me shiver.

I'm sure you already know, but: @_date: 2013-12-07 00:41:13
I keep hearing this sentiment, but I haven't had a single problem with them.  Well...until now it seems.
