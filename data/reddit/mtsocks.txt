Hi everyone, Molly from MtSocks here. Thanks for the mention Dale! Our Bitcoin socks are available [here]( :)
Our Proof of Sock feature is just one of the ways we are trying to help teach people about Bitcoin! We also:
* Include an information card with every pair of socks that teaches you about the design (designs inspired by important/iconic events in Bitcoin's history)
* Do limited runs (aka finite supply) of each design
* Only accept payment in Bitcoin (BTC)
* Donate a % of profits to the Bitcoin Core Foundation
We're new, so let us know what you think - feedback welcome! :)

Shoutout to u/mavensbot (the original artist) for the idea behind the design. Send us a message and we'll send you a pair!

It's not a joke, it's a play on words. MtGox is a big part of the history of Bitcoin.
