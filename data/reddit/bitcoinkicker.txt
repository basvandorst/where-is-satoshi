What you've said is 100% true. However, Segwit impact will be negligible. It's not a big enough increase to the blocksize. It's obsolete from he get go. It never was a long term scaling solution, it's not even a short term solution. I'd love to see segwit activate on the legacy chain, if only for the lulz.

It will be more expensive for individuals to send transactions, but with small blocks even a shitty computer from 1992 can run a full node on dial up. This is important because moving forward, Bitcoin nodes need to be compatible with obsolete technology.

Smaller blocks is exactly what Bitcoin needs. Too many transactions are being included into blocks as it is.

 may have a 20 year history may suggest one thing, but his 3 year history at blockstream suggests something completely different.

What makes you think segwit will make things better?

Just use bitcoin cash, it's faster, cheaper and a better investment

You'll always be on the receiving end if you're using Bitcoin.

This looks very similar to the Bitcoin.com infographic.. Hopefully the persons you gave the talk to understand the difference between BTC and BCH

OP: how do you typically accept payments?

Bitcoin has become nothing more than a poorly functioning speculative asset.

It's a good idea to invest in Bitcoin considering ANY situation! Invest an hour here, an hour there and sooner or later you'll know exactly what to do with your change, spare or not.

You could make it right now and it would apply to us Canadians.
