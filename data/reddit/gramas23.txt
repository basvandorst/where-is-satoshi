Lol right, there are many precoiners and nocoiners but they are too uninformed.
It's just the mainstream media's (aka banksters media) narrative. Most people simply dont think about it themselves - they are like empty pots echoing falsehoods. Individuals who research BTC themselves tend to change their minds - if it doesnt oppose their special interests.
Most informed people are super bullish for the coming year, which makes me wonder are the any informed people who think 2020 isn't going to be that bullish.

I convinced one of my friends to buy bitcoin, he sent some money to Kraken via Paysera and his account was frozen for 30 days at first, lol. 
He then wrote a letter and apologized to our overlords and they unfroze his account five days later and told him not to try such blasphemies ever again.

The safest way to increase your bitcoin holdings is to accept it as a payment for your services. 
The worst way to increase your bitcoin holdings is by going to BitMEX or day trading. Don't do that.

Are you excited for Bakkt futures? How do you think they will impact the price action in the coming months?

Nice, my friend called me this morning about buying, too and that he doesn't care about the short term volatility. Hopefully this continues, BTC education is the key.
