“Based on” literally means “only in.” Its a legal term.
And your definition of Creed is wrong:


1. A formal statement of religious belief; a confession of faith.
2. A system of belief, principles, or opinions: *laws banning discrimination on the basis of race or creed; an architectural creed that demanded simple lines.*
In other words, it’s religion or your philosophical beliefs (like Taoism, Confucianism, etc.). Political beliefs are not included in Creed.

But wait, this discussion is about libertarian hypocrisy. Not about PayPal(?) hypocrisy, which I’m not exactly sure what that is since PayPal isn’t doing something particularly unusual. Libertarians talk a big game about businesses and corporations not being regulated and have autonomy to make all kinds of decisions, but then criticize them when they actually go ahead and do that.
And it most likely is a good business decision for PayPal. Alex Jones was (very publicly) using PayPal to run his business. We probably can’t possibly know what metric PayPal used to come to their decision, but they probably determined that Jones was doing more damage to their brand (whether to old people who are less likely to use PayPal or to young people who tend to not like Jones) than he was bringing in profit.
Most likely, this will never be illegal. PayPal is under no obligation to service someone they don’t want to service, the same as any private organization. Similarly, political ideology is not a protected class so any discussion of discrimination would fall flat as well. PayPal does regularly lock accounts of trouble users or people who seem to be misusing PayPal’s platform, so this isn’t really a case of targeted harassment as well.

Indeed, that is a very concise way of putting it instead of my word vomit.
@_date: 2018-09-22 02:44:37
But there’s two ways here that this discussion isn’t in line with libertarianism. The first is people saying that PayPal shouldn’t be allowed to censor a single individual (which pretty much no one is saying). The second are people criticizing PayPal for making a decision as a private organization that is the best for their business as a whole.
Libertarianism isn’t about letting companies make all their own decisions so they can do the morally just or right thing all the time. 
Hence the criticism. A libertarian approach to this would be “Alex should tone down his message if he wants PayPal to take him on as a customer again.”

Perhaps the actual legal definition of discrimination would help you understand why you are wrong.


n. unequal treatment of persons, for a reason which has nothing to do with legal rights or ability. Federal and state laws prohibit discrimination in employment, availability of housing, rates of pay, right to promotion, educational opportunity, civil rights, and use of facilities based on race, nationality, creed, color, age, sex or sexual orientation.

Thanks for you reply! I watched the whole video.
I disagree with a lot of the fundamental points that it made as well as his choice of scenario.
In his scenario, he was looking at a relatively weak disaster (a hurricane knocked out power) and a relatively highly priced item that is in short supply (a $800 generator). If we switch up the scenario to something like a category 5 hurricane that caused massive flooding, destruction of structures, and the destruction of roads and the goods being price gouged to bottles of water. Now it’s a real crisis situation where the commodity is something needed for life. It’s not so simple to say that the people who cannot afford (or perhaps had all their wealth destroyed) the commodity anymore can make do in the meantime. Perhaps someone is sick or in poor health and needs more water, perhaps a mother needs it for baby formula, perhaps a large but poor family needs it just to survive.
Moreso, in the scenario in the video, the only item being price gouged was a generator. In reality it would be everything needed: water, blankets, clothes, food, etc.. Price gouging forces poor people to choose which necessities they can give up to suffer the least (or have the highest chance of surviving). The idea that the increased demand from price gouging will help the poor more than restricting or preventing gouging is ridiculous as well because there is already a profit on those items (let’s say the $800 generator only cost $400 to make), so the incentive is already there to bring in more commodities.
The video also created a false dichotomy that the only two choices were price gouging and not. There is absolutely room to argue for better government support agencies to react to crisis situations. (As an aside, I know libertarians hate taxes, but I’m sure most pay for insurance and government organizations that respond in this situations are essentially insurance agencies, returning much of the value of the taxes those people pay.) Private entities also have the right to refuse a sale or purchase at any time (even in a crisis) especially if they are concerned about their supply. In addition those institutions can put a limit on the amount that any individual can purchase, doing a much better job than price gouging to stretch out the supply to as many people as possible.

Thank you got your more detailed response!
I think Somalia is an example of unintended application of some (what would be called) libertarian values. That's not an attack on libertarianism, but I think rather a reminder that any political system can easily result in major issues if applied improperly or incompletely.
I personally would argue that government monopolies *can* be fine, but that capitalist monopolies are always bad. I think what determines the value of a monopoly is its intended goal. Government monopolies have varied goals, but generally they revolve around the continued success of either the government or the country, which generally leads to prosperity for the people in one way or another. Capitalist monopolies have the intended goal of making profit and retaining their economic dominance, both of which are at odds with the "out" group (versus the "in" group who are members or parts of that monopoly).
I disagree with the notion that you can ever *choose* to not participate in any monopoly. That isn't really how it works in the capitalist world and I fail to see how that would ever benefit society as a whole when it comes to governments. Perhaps the *individual* can benefit, but corporations have a lot more strength and power to take advantage of such powers which quickly nullify and reverse any benefits achieved by the individual.
The current setup for environmental issues pits corporations against government institutions, with the latter having an advantage because they control both the regulation making and the regulation monitoring (to a certain degree). For your point (A), it cannot possibly be as effective because the situation would be reversed with corporations having the advantage because they start out with the rights and their opposition would be private citizens who would, for 99%+ of situations, have less power than the corporations. Consider a case just recently when [a cigarette company sued an entire country]( and then consider that private citizens would have to try to compete with that in court. Even if the current system is imperfect (which is certainly is, I'm not opposed to fixing it or making it better), the problem *doesn't* line in corporations not having enough power.


To this last point, it isn't really right to accuse either side of being dishonest. Personally I think that libertarianism fails to address solutions for many problems that government does and currently provides solutions for, instead opting to hand-wave those issues by saying the free market will account for it. That takes a lot of faith in the free-market when some of the issues that *we have seen* first-hand did not result in the outcomes many libertarians claim we can be sure of if we dismantled the government.

If I am incorrect, then please enlighten me?
For the issues I mentioned above:


Nothing wrong with this rule under libertarianism. Ron Paul was fine with it.


This is the libertarian belief and Ron Paul’s personal stance. The federal government shouldn’t regulate marriage and should only make a definition for the kinds of unions between individuals, leaving the enforcement of and regulation up to the States. This allows for some states to say they won’t grant any new unions between, for instance, 2 men.


Libertarians don’t believe the federal government has a right to take away firearms, for instance. I, personally, prefer that convicted felons (especially violent ones) do not have guns.


And once again, libertarians believe this is the federal government overstepping its power. It should be up to the people and the courts to decide what kinds of pollution are acceptable! Ignoring the reality that the court system favors those with money and that there is an intrinsic value in preserving the environment in favor of corporate profit for the future is absolutely insane. 
I can name other issues as well, but please start here. I elaborated on what I was saying so that no one would need to make assumptions. I would appreciate if you do the same because a flat “you just don’t understand libertarianism” is rather untrue and demeaning.
@_date: 2018-10-30 17:49:34


Right here encapsulates the issue I am trying to highlight. The libertarian concern is to make a return to the status quo as opposed to ensuring the health and safety of those affected by a disaster.
In a situation where roads have been destroyed, it doesn’t matter how high the demand is because new goods are not going to be brought in so easily (unless by helicopter which would destroy the profitability, regardless of price gouging). That’s why an institution, like FEMA, that doesn’t have a vested interest in making profit is he best at getting life-saving commodities into a disaster zone because their incentive is saving lives and speed, so the extra cost on expensive transportation does not matter.
Unfortunately, he current administration has been cutting FEMA drastically despite the large number of natural disasters in recent years, moving some of that money over to the far more important ICE.

*Decent* isn’t the right word at all. Ron Paul cares more about libertarianism and it’s purity than the well-being of people. Being an idealist doesn’t mean he’s a good person, even if you agree with a lot of his votes.
Libertarianism has a terrible track record on issues. Ignoring how the ideology completely falls apart when it comes to large-scale economic structures, it falls on the wrong side of many social and environmental issues and Ron Paul’s record shows that. A country where Don’t Ask Don’t Tell is acceptable, gay marriage is a state issue, gun regulation is non-existent, the Clean Water Act is a violation of “people’s rights,” and likewise with the Clean Air Act is absolutely horrifying. Plus there is much more.
Ron Paul’s ideology would set the US back 50 years because he doesn’t particularly care about beyond what he considers “personal freedom.”
@_date: 2018-10-31 02:30:24


I'm not misunderstanding, this is exactly what I said. You and other libertarians are prioritizing what you consider "rebuilding" whereas most people prioritize getting the necessities to affected individuals first (i.e. food, water, shelter). You are saying your main priority will help the priorities of others (which is obviously quite debatable, especially given everything I have written), but the fact of the matter is that the former is always going to trump the latter in your ideology. I personally, and many others, consider this belief that economic freedom outweighs life to be nonsensical (at the very least).


This goes back to what I said several comments back. These aren't the only two options. Businesses can restrict how much individuals can purchase in a crisis situation or the government can supply more necessities to increase the supply, paid for by taxes. This isn't a 2-choice situation.
To drive this point home, let's do a thought experiment. A store has 400 water bottles normally priced at $2/bottle. In your price gouging situation, those 400 bottles are now priced at $20/bottle. Let's say we have two groups of people (poor and rich): the 20 poor who on average have $30 to their name and the 20 rich who on average have $300 to their name. In your price-gauging world, maybe about 5 poor people spent almost everything they had on a single bottle of water and 20 rich people ended up with 15 bottles each. 15 poor people ended up with nothing and now they will suffer. Now let's imagine a real world scenario where price gouging is illegal but the business limits their transactions to a max of 5 bottles per person. Now in this real world scenario 40 people bought 5 bottles each, so 200 bottles are sold (so 100 to spare if they are needed) and the poor people have $20 left. No one is going to suffer from life-threatening dehydration and there isn't a price barrier to basic necessities needed for life. This is how your priorities end up negatively impacting people.

In particularly devastated areas, like with Florence or Katrina for instance, roads are shut down. No matter the demand or lack of supply, it simply isn’t profitable to airdrop supplies in for sale via helicopter if retailers do not have helicopters to easily use. That’s why FEMA acts as a middleman to buy supplies from nearby locations and then handles the transportation. Someone has to eat that transpiration cost and it simply throws off any guaranteed profit.
I certainly don’t think libertarians are entirely cold and in humane (although I think their beliefs would have unintended consequences, hence the entirely). I simply disagree with the idea that the potential for profit will always, or possibly ever, be the best solution for crisis situations. Take Peutro Rico for instance, where there was very limited profit to be gotten from moving in necessities to the territory. The vast majority of commodities were sent out of goodwill or government action (and not much of the latter). A situation where the limited supplies were further restricted from people who desperately needed them but had no more possessions to buy and sell with would have made an already terrible situation even worse.

You’re far too aggressive. Please keep it civil. This isn’t a sub for politics, so if you want to discuss politics then at least be polite about it.
I stated some similarities that Somalia have with libertarianism. I’m not making some kind of serious claim that Somalia is a libertarian paradise or something. Any other political ideology is able to accept the good examples and bad examples in history. Mercantilism has to accept the atrocities Britain and Spain caused around the world. Socialism has to accept the mess that was the USSR and Maoist China. Capitalism has to accept Indonesia as well as the crimes of many developed nations like the US kidnapping workers from Shanghai. None of the above are perfect embodiments of those ideologies. It’s ridiculous to argue that any of those don’t represent the ideologies *to some degree* just because they aren’t perfect 1:1s.
@_date: 2018-10-30 17:57:21
There are hundreds of examples in history across the world... I am not sure why you would disagree with that.
Most militaries are government monopolies. Land rights are generally government controlled monopolies (i.e. other organizations do not have rights to circumvent governments laws and regulations). Oil in many countries like Russia or Saudi Arabia are government controlled monopolies. In China the Social Credit System is a monopoly (not good for the people, but very effective at what it does). And then there are lots more examples.
Government monopolies aren’t even necessary, to clarify my argument. Government institutions provide affordable alternatives and competition to private industry. For instance, the postal system which guarantees everyone has the ability to send and receive mail at fair prices.
@_date: 2018-10-31 04:37:39


I am pointing out the difference in priorities. Just because you *believe* your priority will excel to the point that it will meet everyone else's main priority doesn't change the fact that there are two clear, different priorities. And that is worth noting because if you are incorrect then libertarianism fails to meet the the main priority of the majority of people, and that is a problem.


This question is a red herring. You are simplifying the point so much and disregarding main issues at hand, mainly that there is a loss of life and health due to price gauging.
Moreso, this is incorrect. For your ideology to work, the government cannot bring in supplies for free because that increases the supply and lowers the demand. Lobertarians cannot control charity, so what you are arguing for is (to use your over-simplification) government and charities versus charities and free market. The government, of course, is a lot more unified and coordinated than a group of separate entities in the free market.


This is what you hope, but there are some key issues here. First, no one is happy to pay 1000% for a water bottle when they are in a life-or-death situation. Second, no one doesn't *need* water, it is a necessity for life and in crisis situations running water can be disabled, clean drinking water polluted by flooding or chemical runoff, or entire homes can be destroyed. Third, you are assuming that roads are fully operational to get supplies in, which is often not the case. You ignored my point several comments back about how it becomes unprofitable to move in necessities like water if roads are damaged beyond use, but that is an important consideration because if no one is bringing in new supplies your entire argument falls absolutely and completely apart (regardless of the major holes in it already). Fourth, private entities are focused on maximizing profit rather than getting the water to the people who need it the most. Since your system requires there to be minimal to no government intervention, there is no single group with the goal and resources to help those in the most need.


In my scenario there was an excess of water supplies. The amount of water an individual could purchase was limited to ensure everyone got some. The people who show up first got the same amount of water as everyone else, because the store intentionally limited the amount they gave out to force that situation. This is actually how supplies are passed out in crisis situations, so this is not some radical expectation.


I used a simple though experiment because we seem to be simplifying this argument well enough already. If we want to make this more complex, then we will also have to revisit your supply-demand argument to see the realities in a crisis situation (e.g. logistics, range of disaster, real world examples, etc.). As it stands, that seems unnecessary.
I think it is also important to point out that you ignored or missed a critical point against your ideology that I wrote above. This point is important because it directly contradicts your goal of restoring equilibrium as quickly as possible:




@_date: 2018-10-30 17:35:51
Thank you for your response. I much prefer a discussion like this!


This is another issue with libertarianism that I didn’t mention. There are huge issues with abortion being up to State decision. For instance, a situation where a state has written into law that abortion is murder would prosecute individuals who travel to other States where it is legal. There’s also issues with States that have it legalized are paying for those States that do not. This is all ignoring the issue that States are restricting personal liberty on religious grounds, which *should* be opposite libertarian beliefs.


It is easy to use the “protect their families” line while ignoring the realities of gun regulations and the violent actions of certain crimes. Should someone who is convicted of domestic abuse and assault with a deadly weapon (e.g. threatening to shoot an SO) ever be allowed to have a gun again? Should a serial killer like the recent Synagogue Shooter be allowed to have a gun 20 years from now? Should a convicted rapist who raped others at gunpoint ever be allowed to even touch a firearm again? These are all situations where a firearm in the hands of these individuals poses a direct and real threat to the life and liberty of innocent people. Since when does the right to a firearm outweigh anyone else’s right to life and liberty?
Could the government make it so that only violent felons cannot have guns? Sure. That isn’t the libertarian stance though, as the ideology says that government cannot regulate personal liberties (except when it comes to abortion and birth control I guess). I personally would be all for non-violent drug offenses not carrying the firearm restrictions.


I disagree that following the logic would lead to libertarianism, but more importantly I need to clarify that I do not think the US court system is corrupt (I cannot speak on other systems). I would say my view is a pragmatist view that the court system is heavily favored towards those with money. Participation in the legal system requires money and the people most adversely affected by the law and legal systems are those without the money to participate. In addition, the court system is bogged down and slow while also being very complicated, preventing individuals from adequately navigating it without help.
This all makes it easy for corporation to abuse the faults of the legal system to circumvent existing laws and regulations. To further remove laws and regulations so that it would become the responsibilities of *private citizens* who have significantly less money and power than the federal government would be to push circumstances very far into corporations’ favor. In addition, moving regulation out of the hands of the government and into the legal system would further slow down an already tediously slow process.


I disagree with this stance. I think this is a mischaracterization that libertarians like to use which sounds good for them but isn’t honest. Government is largely bureaucracy that gives out subsidies and regulates. Just because the government has a deal with, for instance, soy farmers doesn’t means the federal government is responsible for all of the pollution those soy farmers create.


I agree that a lot of people don’t know a lot about libertarianism, but I think I disagree that that is a bad thing. I don’t think libertarianism would solve most, if any, of the major issues facing the country today. I think it’s more important for people to educate themselves on specific issues and form an accurate and informed opinion themselves rather than prescribing to an ideology that will tell them how to think.
It also annoys me that there are conservatives who hide behind a libertarian label to try to feign legitimacy for their arguments. You probably saw my disdain above when it comes to abortion because I know that under pure libertarianism neither States nor federal government would be allowed to restrict it, but other interests have hijacked that discussion and belief.
@_date: 2018-10-30 18:28:15
I think it’s important to note the intended function of a specific government institution. For instance, China’s social credit system is intended to marginalize dissidents and certain ethnic groups (creating an us vs. then situation instead of a people vs. government) and Saudi Arabia’s government monopoly on oil is meant to fill the government coffers which are directly tied to the royalty’s wealth. Considering those functions, these institutions are very successful (and very immoral).
USPS doesn’t have a monopoly, as seen by its major competitors FedEx and UPS. Those competitors are more than welcome to compete with the prices that USPS offer for small packages/letters, but they do not. USPS is meant to have the function to provide everyone the ability to mail letters to one another, a function it carries out quite effectively. I have no real comment on the Amazon situation because I agree that government subsidies to companies should be drastically cut down in general.
Some good examples of monopolies that are successful are the US Park Service (maintains the upkeep of national parks), government-monopoly healthcare systems like Sweden, and China Telecom/China Unicom/China Mobile which control the choice of Chinese citizens when it comes to their utilities (providing s constant a consistent price choice).
@_date: 2018-10-30 14:42:58
I think that’s a pretty blanket statement that is backed more by personal ideology than economic theory.
Government monopolies work. They’ve worked for thousands of years of human history and hundreds of years of modern history. It’s libertarianism that is untested and unproven of how it works on a macro scale (unless you want to count Somalia, which I understand most libertarians do not which is okay). Not only that, but the modern system for most of the world is a mix of capitalism and socialism. It’s nonsensical to claim that most of the modern governments today are “socialist” because it ignores the reality of capitalism in those countries.
Libertarianism doesn’t have a solution for the crippling power of monopolies, the immoral practices of price-gouging, or the threat to personal safety that is unfettered access to hazardous materials and weapons (e.g. explosives). These are issues which simply can’t and won’t be solved by the “good nature of people” and the libertarian mantra that it will work itself out or fix itself in the court system isn’t good enough, because in the meantime countless people would suffer, die, or be deprived of the liberty that libertarianism is supposed to protect.

Well, for starters it has a significant lack of federal government, federal regulation, and taxation. In addition, individuals have large amounts of personal freedom and some semblance of a court system to address damages and personal conflicts.
I don’t particularly care one way or another. I’m not very interested in digging into the governmental structures that make up Somalia and comparing each on a scale of “libertarian or not.” I moreso find it amusing that libertarians get so offended at the mention that Somalia exhibits at least some virtues of libertarianism in practice. A more reasonable position would be to accept that there are some clear similarities and move on than outright denying and getting angry.

That seems like a rather nonsensical goal considering most people’s first concern would be to help as many people who are in immediate strife as possible and get them the bare necessities, screw economics if it gets in the way. But okay, if you want to use the restoration of economic institutions as the primary goal after a disaster then we shall discuss that, but keep in mind this is more the *libertarian* goal than the *general populace’s goal*.
If that’s the goal, then how is price gouging going to restore economic institutions faster than not price gouging? Using the same logic that’s been used up to this point, the “increased demand” will bring in investors who are eager to cash in on the disaster and charge higher rates for basic necessities.
So the economic institutions being established (although most likely these “investors” are only interested in short-term as a long-term investment in the area would not be profitable due to the reduced population) are going to be from outside the community. These new institutions are going to take the wealth from the already damaged community and move it to other regions that *haven’t* been damaged by a disaster (they haven’t been damaged because they have the surplus), leaving long-term damage on the financial health of the community.
Add onto than though, the local merchants and vendors that were previously selling goods and necessities have long since run out. Being on the front-line, the money they made from price-gouging is less than that of the vendors that will later come from beyond the community, as the demand was less. Add even onto that that any profit they made won’t be able to outright pay for damages to their businesses and the financial damage due to the disaster and the economic vultures (if you will) will cause a long-lasting drain on their profit margins. The financial damage to the community is two-fold.
Now on top of everything, this is just the libertarian support for price-gouging. Combine this with their unwillingness to tax to support federal agencies that help *rebuild* communities, covering costs from damage and the costs of rebuilding. A lot of insurance companies have Act of God clauses that will get them out of paying for such insane level of damages, so this belief just further ruins the community.
If you take this goal that you stated and follow through with it, it will lead to widespread economic devastation in small communities that are liable to never recover.

First, no the government alleviates the effects of natural disaster through wide-reaching federal agencies that have the money, manpower, and authority to mobilize and transport the necessary people and materials to disaster areas. If we are talking magic fair dust, then perhaps "free market!" and "supply and demand!" should be the first thing we look at.


I'm not sure you realize how poor of an example this is for your argument. Due to the flooding, large parts of the city were uninhabitable and it was **not** profitable to bring in supplies, so I'm not even sure why you would think outside sellers would send in goods via... row boat(?) when the cost of transportation far outweighed the possible profit (considering most people had literally nothing).
In addition, it is important to note that Hurricane Katrina occurred while the party of "small government" was in charge of the country. It is notable that natural disasters are less deadly and the after-effects less devastating when the Democratic party is in control. It is situations where FEMA is intentionally cut and made ineffective that disasters like this happens (see Puerto Rico).


Your argument is that businesses will bring in goods to sell because it is profitable. Can you please elaborate how any of this will be profitable when government is giving away all these supplies for free? Also, government is absolutely able to do it all by itself. The only reason it ever **can't** do it by itself is due to Republican (and libertarian) backed cutting of FEMA funding.


You're speaking as though these logistics have never been worked out before. How do you think rescue workers, whether for charity or for government, hand out supplies? How do you think it gets decided who gets what and how much? People spend years (and sometimes decades) studying to be able to handle situations like this. There is a reason FEMA and other organizations are supposed to be run by **experts** will expertise and experience in handling situations like this. This is also why the free market will never be able to fulfill the needs of disaster survivors and properly get needed supplies to where they are needed, because the free market has no need for those experts and logisticians.
More than that, you speak poorly of the current ways that disaster situations are handled but I do not think you have a clear grasp on the massive scale of logistics and planning required or how well relief organizations already perform. Issues like Puerto Rico and New Orleans are due to **cuts** in FEMA and other agencies because of people who *hold similar beliefs to yours*. And even if your view of the situation was correct, how in the world is making sure the rich are properly cared for first and then letting life-saving necessities trickle down to the poor whenever the free market is finally able to make it in time (and I think it is fair to say that the government with the full force of the coast guard can be faster) better? That sounds like some kind of sick society where the proletariats survive and prosper and the plebeians tear each other apart for the scraps, which is a hard no thanks from me.
