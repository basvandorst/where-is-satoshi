So what do you expect as the long term outcome? Are you just sticking with BTC since you think many of the altcoins will crash when the bubble pops? Or going with ETH?
Curious what your invested in

I agree. I put in about 3k (decent chunk of my total money right now), and I'm at 6k. That's a crazy ROI, and I know lots of people would sell, but I really enjoy being "in" the crypto game

Not bad ending up with 1 million though eh?

Yeah, my money may currently be smart, but it's also in a massive speculation frenzy and can gain or lose thousands of dollars of value in hours. Volatility like that makes it's a terrible currency

Pretty sweet for that purpose right now, at least. Until/if it crashes for good

I imagine there are going to be quite a few more stories in 30 yrs like "I had tens of thousands of dollars in this magical currency thar always went up....until it crashed"

Damn you're right. That's a pretty strong brag actually

Can't wait, just means it's time to buy in more

I think it's just now becoming mainstream. So I think the bubble bursting is even closer

I finally got in to crypto, though my principal was pretty small, I'm very excited to be a part of this journey

Do you have any links to the info on the fork? It's in November right?

How do they get stolen? Isn't the whole idea that they're secure?
