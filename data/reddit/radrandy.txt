First rule of investing:
Never try and predict future price action.
@_date: 2018-09-30 04:24:52
This is the kinda shit that gets upvoted lol
BANKS BAD! GIMME UPVOTE!
@_date: 2018-05-13 08:16:09
You have no idea how much money, trucks, and supplies we gave Russia...do you? 
Keep dreaming for that USA collapse and living in that dream world of Russian and Chinese domination lol
@_date: 2018-08-28 02:22:47
Because they were gambling on a completely speculative asset, and the hype and allure was that they'd become rich.
Fast forward to now, and BTC is still a speculative asset, except everybodys selling, because they dont want to lose their money. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 04:59:18
Lol yeah that's because bond yields have hit a high.
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:53:03
Also the world's largest economy and it can happily pay off its debt. 
Oh yeah...and it'd backed by the US military.
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:45:43
Are you trying to hint that the market is cyclic?  What's your point?
@_date: 2018-05-13 01:01:43
Please tell me your sekritssss
Step one 1 
Buy crypto
Step 2
Hope price goes up
Step 3
Never work again
Is this your master plan?
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:56:18
Lol mind explaining that one?
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:54:34
So...pretty much 90% of people here
@_date: 2018-05-13 01:04:47
What makes you think BTC is being undervalued? 
What makes you think BTC has any value?
@_date: 2018-05-08 20:30:36
I'm fine with having my money in a bank. Much safer to keep my money in USD.
@_date: 2018-05-13 01:40:07
Yeah making a living day trading is such a shame. Unlike buying crypto and hoping the price increase, forex takes skill. It'll also be here in 10 years unlike BTC.
@_date: 2018-05-13 05:17:43
I've considered that. With the majority of the crypto market being speculative, it seems easier to gauge sentiment. I've hesitated because I'm doing well in fx and the volatility in the crypto market can blow you up quite easily.
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:10:09
Well that's something we can both agree on!
@_date: 2018-05-13 01:51:09
haha ok then...so I guess the US military isn't protecting the United States?
and I guess the US is having trouble paying off its debt? 
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:19:56
Its only worth what people are willing to pay for it.
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:59:48
Nobody here understands that crypto is worthless. Fiat currency does the job we want it to do just fine.
@_date: 2018-05-13 05:29:07
Yeah let's ignore every other advantage the US military has over Russia because hypersonic missiles rule everything lol 
We all saw how well Russia handled Georgia back in 2008. 
Keep on dreaming dude. The US makes the rules because they have the biggest muscles. You'd be hard pressed to find anyone who actually believes the US is anything BUT the world's most dominant power. 
You also kindly left out simple economic fundamentals when you mentioned our large debt. We also have the world's largest economy. 
Japan's debt to gdp ratio (much better indicator than just mentioning total debt) is at 243%.
France is at 98%
Italy is at 135%
US is at 104%
@_date: 2019-03-19 20:45:56
So lemme get this straight...
You need electricity to make a transaction with BTC.
But Venezuela is in the midst of a blackout.
So you cant use BTC....
Checkmate fiat?
@_date: 2019-03-19 20:52:23
Agreed. Though I wouldn't expect the grid to be repaired anytime soon though. The citizens of Venezuala will probably be living in constant blackouts until Maduro is ousted. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 20:44:29
Hyper-Inflation for the worlds most broken economy=the end of fiat?
I have no idea what this guys trying to say.
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:50:22
Moving the goal post? Lol he moved the entire stadium! 
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:49:53
This is a whole new level of kool-aid drinking madness lol
People in here are actually comparing BTC to the Bolivar, or other failed currencies over the past 100 years.
Wow. You all should brush up on safe Haven currencies. There's a reason no sane investor is going to hedge their portfolio on a line of code.
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:32:32
The USD, GBP, or CHF are currencies which cant keep its value long term? What?! I'm really curious how you deducted that a currency like the USD hasn't  kept it's value. Not only  has the USD been a safe Haven currency for decades, the GBP has kept its value for over 300 years lol.
Mind explaining why investors also hedge their portfolio with the USD? Cause no matter the economic climate, the USD will always be strong. Look up the Dollar Smile theory.
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:55:55
BTC, along with most other cryptos has been in a strong downtrend for months. don't blame crypto for this. The information was right infront of you.
@_date: 2019-08-28 01:40:11
Was about to have a bit of a laugh about this, that was until I saw half you morons agreeing with him.
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:11:25
Yeah....downtrends, uptrends are one of the simplest and most easy things to spot. You act like im trying to ask that you all predict the future Lol. Im asking that you look at a chart and see that price is making lower highs and lower lower lows. 
You want more predictions? I predict the price will retrace....and then keep going lower! 
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:56:05
This whole sub is honestly sad. A lot of people here have zero knowledge when it comes to investing or trading. I constantly see people thinking, or doing the exact sort of things a smart investor would never do. Everyone here has no discipline forthis stuff. There is zero though to risk management. Its just a bunch of people, a lot if young kids hoping to become rich...I.get that, but most people here are going to lose money.
 These are completely speculative investments. BTC has lost over half it value in under a year. Then people have the balls to tell me its a better currency than the USD lol This is madness!
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:45:59
What? Lol yeah I certainly think they'll will hold their value long term. The GBP has kept its value since 1707. The USD has been the worlds reserve currency for almost 80 years. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 00:21:09
Many goverment employees in Venezuela are paid in USD. Theres also many black market dealers willing to swap Bolivars for USD....at a very high price of course.
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:58:25
That's not the point. The point is the USD won't lose over half its value in under a YEAR! 
I'm done trying to knock sense into you kids. Go have fun. Lol this is insanity.
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:42:28
No. The USD is helping Venezuala. Its actually tangible and wont lose 10% of its value in a day. You can put your $20 in you ass crack and keep it safe. You can instantly buy any goods you want with it. I understand you may have heard of some Venezuelans buying BTC, but they're a very small minority. The USD is currently king in Venezuela and it will be for a long time.
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:20:28
Speculative bubble....just a speculative bubble.....or is it?
@_date: 2018-07-03 02:28:04
Dad, i thought it was because BTC only had speculative value? 
And isnt it called a descending channel?
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:51:44
To the core!
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:49:56
I'm not sure what this "freedom index" measures, but I've personally always felt very free in the USA...more than I have in any other country. It's one of the last countries to still allow completely free speech, the right to bear arms, and you still get to keep over half your paycheck. 
Freedom to me isn't giving the government half of what I make. Freedom to me isn't getting thrown in jail over posting a drawing of Muhammed on Facebook. I also have a huge problem with the European Union and their unelected bureaucrats. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:01:39
Lol aye I know. I just wanted to prove a point ;)
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:22:09
Who ya taking to, buddy?
Btw, I lived in Berlin for 9 months. Not sure where you got 2 weeks from.
Also, I ever thought I'd see the day that a German citizen would defend the soviets starvation of Berlin. If you're anything like your fellow citizens...then we better start preparing for a 3rd liberation of Western Europe!
@_date: 2018-04-28 23:44:14
That's all anecdotal. Just because 1% of the population can do it, doesn't negate my point. 
Guess what you can do with fiat currency? You can buy EVERYTHING with it! It's already backed by an entire system that allows it. 
My question to you is this:
Do you consider gold more valuable than the USD? Cause I'm sure you'd be able to find more people that would except gold, than BTC.
Cause gold is a safe haven investment. That's why when the economy is bad, more people buy gold and the price increases. The opposite is true if the economy is good. 
Fiat currency is on the other end of the spectrum from gold. BTC is somewhere in between the two. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:13:56
Until you can pay rent, and everything else in BTC...it's not as valuable. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 21:52:35
Not even sure where to begin...
You really think Trump has more power than Hitler? I would LOVE to see your reasoning behind that. 
You think the Soviet Union would've stayed nuclear free if it wasn't for the US? Lol fucks sake...what are you reading? Nazi Germany, the US, AND the Soviet Union were all trying to find a way to split atoms. We just got there first. 
I'm sure you could find a way to paint the soviets as the good guys, even when discussing the Berlin air lift. You've read about that...right? The Soviets cut off all supplies to over 2 million citizens of West Berlin. They were going to starve the entire city, but then the US airlifted supplies to everyone in the city. Such evil fucks we are...
This was also during the Marshal Plan. When the US gave Western Europe over $13 billion in economic assistance (over $100billion in today value) We also eliminated all trade barriers and created the foreign exchange market to help your economies recover. 
Yet here we stand all these years later...and you have brainwashed lunatics who can somehow find a way to paint the US as the evil one lol
Go home kid. You can read every book in the world, but if you haven't experienced another country first hand, you're just talking out your ass. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:41:29
Germany? Ive been to Germany. It's a great country. A big reason it's great is because the US taxpayers paid hundreds of billions of dollars into rebuilding it after WW2. Then we spent trillions more defending against the USSR...
Idk, I just hate seeing everyone take a giant shit on my country every chance they get. Especially when they won't openly say where they are from.  I've travelled this entire world, and I've always felt most free while here in the US. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:59:04
In the past, it wasn't our duty to get involved in every European conflict. We were isolationists. Our policy in the past was to let the world deal with their problems. That approach led to Germany trying to conquer Europe twice in 30 years. If you didn't want soviet aggression, then you shouldn't have tried to invade them. If it wasn't for all those US military bases in Germany and Europe, I doubt the Soviet Union would've just given up control of its satellite states. It could also be debated on whether or not they'd have capitulated if it wasn't for the US. For you to go back to your values as a country, while at the same time letting the US protect you, has certainly been beneficial for Germany.
Since the US has been running the show, this world has experienced a global economic boom and unparalleled peace. Global shipment of oil has been uninterrupted that entire time, allowing our economies to grow unhindered. It's not a coincidence that we're living in such prosperous times. 
I guess at the end of the day, you and I are both different...and that's okay. I appreciate Germany for a lot of reasons. I even lived in Berlin for awhile. But for me, freedom is definitely something I feel. It's not something I can measure on a chart, or compare to someone else's freedom on a list. I've earned that right by living in many places around the world. My opinions and feelings are based from experience.
I'm not saying this country doesn't have problems. Our spy agencies are out of control. The federal government is out of control. We got a lot of issues. Like all of our issues before though, we'll deal with them and we'll fix them. 
Btw...as a German, you probably shouldn't be so critical of how our English sounds ;)
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:44:27
What country are you from?
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:21:14
This dudes just an American hating asshole. How the fuck do even come to the conclusion that the US is the worlds 2nd largest military? These euro's have been drinking way too much of their own cool-aide.
@_date: 2018-07-03 02:29:41
This is good for bitcoin.
