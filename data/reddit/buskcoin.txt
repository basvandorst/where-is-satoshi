Since reddit isn't interested in integrating crypto, would anyone be interested in a new reddit clone with cryptocurrency integrated? After all, the code is open source.

I dont think bitcoin would be considered a resource, would it?
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:11:41
You could either 
* A: Make the notes very difficult to counterfeit physically
* B: Have a digital ledger keep track of transactions dually. User1 would give user2 the banknote and a two-factor digital token that proves the transaction took place at a certain time.

What i was trying to say was the buyer should choose how much bitcoin they are willing to buy or alternatively how much fiat they are willing to spend. I don't think the price should be determined at the time of the transaction but that the seller should choose when the price is determined.

That's a very legitimate concern.  The only thing i could recommend is using a bip38 wallet or making the wallet yourself. If you do decide to trust us you would have our real names if anything goes awry.

Why is it so crazy that I wouldn't be able to scan it? This happened. If you enter in a valid address the checksum can't save you. Anyway, my point is that It would be nice to be able to send bitcoin to "john123" for example.

Nice try, buddy. Here's the real address:

Edit: JK, 1QChG6nBQAx996V12TUexNbTTwmx3bzK85 is legit. It currently has 0.01 btc.

well not all of them

Hey, leave ToTheMoonGuy out of this. Otherwise, yeah, I agree with you.
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:04:55
You would need to recieve B too of course because A would have no value. Maybe A could be encrypted.  or there could be a ledger that keeps track of the rightful owner where users need some kind of multi factor authentication code to pass the bitcoin. I'm sure you could think of something.
@_date: 2013-12-22 00:19:19
Sure! I'll get those for you. I'm happy to sell the paper too if you're interested.

It's just kind of cool and I'm lazy. I guess if there were an emergency you could get your bitcoins real quick.
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:31:52
Yeah it's pretty simple. The dragon is printed on the back of the bitcoin wallet before it is sewn shut to cover the private key. The image wraps around to the back of the wallet.  The wallet is made from my brothers handmade hemp paper. I'll have the images for you soon.
@_date: 2013-12-23 01:19:09
These are the only ones we've designed. If you have something in mind we may be able to work it out. The price on etsy is $10 plus  $3 shipping or i can sell them to you for 0.016btc per piece. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:08:09
I only did it once when my Qr code scanner malfunctioned. Still I think we should be able to manually enter it and feel alright.

This is me at every dinner party.
@_date: 2013-12-22 07:08:34
Yes. Anyone who peaked at your private key would have to remove the stitching or cut through the paper.
@_date: 2013-12-22 00:02:05
Doesn't seem like it would cost much more to send them to Sweden. How many is a few? I'm happy to use BIP38! You can pm me or Email me: Keithalgroves if you have any more questions.
@_date: 2013-12-22 00:26:25
I never downvoted you. These are a kind of novelty. However, paper is also a great way to store and save bitcoins so we're just having fun with it. Cheers.
@_date: 2013-12-22 01:58:44
My  brother put these on his etsy account if you're interested in buying some. I forgot to mention that they're made out of hemp! 
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:02:36
@_date: 2013-12-21 21:12:28
Sure! You can pm me if you want to buy one. You'll have to load it yourself. I don't want FinCEN coming after me :)

Cool, I make handmade paper and I thought it would be awesome to be able to print my own blocknotes. I'll let you know if I make a breakthrough. Again, I'm no expert so it's not likely.
I think vanity addresses could help solve this problem. You could generate a vanity address that specifies the printer and links it to the address (E.g. 1Busk1234). Busk is the printer and 1234 would be the first characters in the linked address. This would tie your Blocknotes to your repuation as a printer and make it more difficult to counterfeit. 
Another option is having an online database for valid blocknotes and their associated public addresses.

Thanks! My brother and i don't keep private (or public) keys. It's understandably hard to convince people but we're hoping it will become easier once we've been around awhile. In the meantime there is always bip38!

"This is a bitcoin paper wallet in the form of an origami pig. Load it yourself and keep your bitcoins safely offline. The public key is on the outside, and the private key is folded up inside the model; you have to unfold the pig to get to the private key, like breaking open your piggy bank. The model is about 5cm tall and 10cm long (2"x4"). It is folded from a single uncut square of Nepalese lokta paper, and coated with acrylic protectant before folding."
Edit: I should mention that my brother designed this origami pig and the paper is handmade. Also, if you want pay with bitcoin it's 10% off.
@_date: 2014-02-16 01:23:10
You could also just write the private key on the inside and have trick box wallet!

Is an altcoin with a resistant algorithm possible? It could be a good way to keep track of karma.

I always thought it would be cool if each vote required some small amount of hash power that in turns gets used to mine on a pool or something.
