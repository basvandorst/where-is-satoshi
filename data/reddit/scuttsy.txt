Difficulty would be too high though, you'd never find the first block.

You should put your files that you wish to store online in truecrypt containers also.

Does this mean that people who made the 60gh/s orders will receive the 50gh/s and two 5 gh/s?

Atheism is not a belief system.

It's using the term belief system that i find fault with, it diminishes the point of the phrase. 
If atheism is a belief system, then so is everything that every person 'believes' does not exist. The 'belief' in the non existence of zombies on the rings of Saturn is now a belief system, the 'belief' in the non existence of invisible fairies in Ireland is now a belief system. 
Atheism is not special in this regards, it is not believing in deities.
I think the word belief gets misused. This is not just me being pedantic either, i do think it gives real religious believers the wrong impression about the meaning of Atheism, they see it as comparable to their own faith because they see it as a belief system that it is not.

The above guys did indeed win. I would guess they are friends with the guy that runs the site, certainly they are friends with each other, they were losing chips to each other depending on who needed them, likely used secondary accounts to give themselves chips first. 
Scam site for sure, avoid.

That's absolutely fair enough if it's true, but here are the options:
1. You are all colluding together
2. You lack the security and/or ability to detect some pretty straight forward collusion
3. You are incompetent
Chat logs? What on earth are you talking about, the collusion wasn't chat based, these guys will be talking to each other on third party communications.
Check the hand logs, check the time stamps, they kept going all in over and over and over again against each other on the two player table. You will see each game over in less than a minute, generally faster, with the same players, Max, Devin and Office2010 giving each other chips to maintain their fraudulent lead.

I was having a good time playing on this site, but it feels like i have wasted those hours when you see the guy in the chip lead overall 'Devin' colluding with his friend 'max' and likely 'office2010' as well,  and who knows who else. 
If these guys actually win the prizes by cheating it really is a black mark on your site.

Of course i understand what you mean, but not believing in x is not the same as believing in no x.
You are saying it is a 'belief that there is no God or Omnipotent being', that is not correct, it is the stance or position that there is no God.
Even what you told me to google, which i did, says the following "Atheism is, in a broad sense, the rejection of belief in the existence of deities". Again, a stance, not a belief.

Look up ASIC's, that is what you need to mine nowadays, don't throw money at them either in the hopes of making a profit, read about difficulty increase and it should explain why hardware becomes obsolete so quickly in the mining game.
