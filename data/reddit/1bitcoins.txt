If you do some unbiased research you see after 911 Sollog was one of the most searched for terms on Yahoo
He was top 50 Yahoo search terms for a while after 911.
You can still see his 9/11/1998 post to usenet archived by initially dejanews and then google bought them
EXACT DETAILS OF 911
He hit the 2004 Tsunami
He does consulting for major governments
HE SPEAKS and his fans follow
He says 5K Bitcoin by end of 2014
BUY NOW IMO
Sure some say he's bs
But if you just search usenet you see his famous predictions and it's why major media calls him a MODERN NOSTRADAMUS
So he has a nice track record on earthquakes and terrorism and he called the dot com bubble end of 1999 and he called the 2008 banking crash.
5K bitcoin?
SOLLOG SAYS IT IS GUARANTEED

They only got a minor amount of his wallets, the one he had open and maybe another they could find from mirroring his laptops cache.
The big stash they can't crack.
So if you are arrested with a live bitcoin wallet open you lose them, if it's not open, they can't access them, the US Gov doesn't have the computing power to crack the cryptography.
I read it would take a network of machines powered by many suns trillions of years to crack the cryptography.

I read his book, it's very simple math and equates bitcoin value to his trust factor which matches of all things credit cards to GWP.
Last bubble the Bitcoin Algorithm predicted was 700K users 1K/500 bubble
12/2013 we hit 700K my wallets as tracked by one of the top wallet suppliers there is from bitcoinblock.info 
As his Bitcoin Algorithm shows a peak around 1K happened and the natural floor value of 500USD was hit.
Next Bitcoin Algorithm bubble is 7M My Wallets in circulation and we are now at 2M My Wallets
His Trust Factor equation is simple math and it is a simple algorithm that is now being banned on sites like BCT
7M my wallets = 10K/5K bubble
So as we approach 7M my wallets his Bitcoin Algorithm predicts 10K bubble with a trust factor floor of 5K
Then he shows each bubble out to 7 Billion users or 100% of GWP
7M users = 5K USD Floor Value .1% of world pop and .1% of GWP
70M users = 50K usd floor 1% of world pop and 1% of GWP
700M users = 500K usd fllor 10% of world pop and 10% of GWP
Then he shows 700M major credit cards exist, visa/mc/amex and those are 10% of the world pop and they do exactly 10% of the GWP
So that's his book in a synopsis and if you discuss it you get BANNED on BCT
So let's see what happens when bitcoinchain.info says they have put out 7M my wallets
It's 2M now and the 500USD floor is holding
SO IT IS A BRILLIANT BOOK and BCT does not want the info out
Have any of you read the book?
I have
IT IS BRILLIANT and I'm not the author
Credit cards are not like Bitcoin Wallets since most of the world is deemed not worthy of a major credit card by the existing bank cartels
Bitcoin sees no difference in users, so it's a viral digital currency that will grow as sites like Facebook and Twitter grew exponentially as we have indeed seen.
So Bitcoin value will depend on one thing how many have wallets and that percentage of the population is the underlying real world fundamental to his bitcoin algorithm.
Why BCT is banning users discussing it is weird but BCT has mods and mods tend to be censorship crazy.
Anyway, his 5M ultimate value is if Bitcoin becomes the first GLOBAL CURRENCY or has 100% acceptance with 7 Billion wallets.
Then goes on to show if it is adopted for derivatives the top ceiling is 50M Bitcoin or 1200 Trillion which is the total of derivatives.

Seems the USD already crashed IMO

I would say when major internet retailers started to accept Bitcoin it was 'mainstream'.
Now it will just follow its historic rise in the percentage of people that actually open bitcoin wallets.
If you want to make sense of the growth values you need to read BITCOIN ALGORITHM by Dr. Sol Adoni.
He's the first mathematician to identify a simple algorithm that is predicting 4 future bubbles for bitcoin.
The next bubble is 7Million users and he uses My Wallets to gauge the market share of that number.
His bitcoin algorithm makes order out of the crazy value swings we all saw the past couple of years and My Wallets is the key to understanding the growth.
700K my wallets occurred end of 2013 which was a tenfold increase in the bicoin trust factor relative to a tenfold increase of users from 70K wallets.
70K wallets was 100/50 USD bitcoin values 100 was the peak of the bubble and 50 was the natural support floor based upon one thing, the size of the user base.
700K wallets was end of 2013 and we saw 1k/500 values as the bitcoin algorithm predicted.
Now we are 2M my wallets and going to hit a new bubble around 7M my wallet users and that bubble is 10K peak and 5K real value support.
Then 70M my wallets predicts 100K/50K bitcoin peak/valley
Then 700M my wallets predicts 1M/500K bitcoin peak/valley
Now you know why big money is chasing Bitcoin
It's a viral digital currency with only a built in limit to 7 Billion wallets.
So 700M to 7Billion users is the upper limits
Unless it moves into derivatives which is book explains
Then we can theoretically see even 50M bitcoin if it takes over derivatives too
Where will the upper limits of bitcoin stop?
700 Million users seems like a lot until you realize how many users facebook and twitter has and that is the viral growth patterns bitcoin is now seeing as it moved into mainstream awareness.
When you see BITCOIN logos on Overstock and Expedia and now on local merchants, how many major sites need to explode it well past 7 Million wallets.
When you see Bitcoin on FB or Twitter as a way to pay, then you will see global currency for real.

Actually Bitcoin is following a simple math algorithm now called the Bitcoin Algorithm.
One thing matters that being the trust factor of Bitcoin which is the same thing that supports any fiat currency.
The book Bitcoin Algorithm shows the next bitcoin bubble is 7M users or wallets. At that time the value will have a predictable 10K/5K peak/valley.
When it hits the next bubble of 70M users it is 100K/50K peak/valley
7M my wallets are expected to happen near the end of this year, they have 2M or so now.
Last trust factor plateau was 700K users it hit end of 2013 when bitcoin soared to the predicted 1K peak and had support as a natuaral floor of 500.
So don't watch the daily swings, just watch the growth curve, it's a simple tenfold user algorithm and bitcoinchain.info has the info to watch, that being my wallets.

If you run a bitcoin exchange you have to register with that state as a money transmitter that's the fed rule. So a surety bond is need to do volume now inside the USA.

Just post a link to this book on BCT that proves 10K bitcoin is about to happen based on one fundamental, 7M wallets soon. You will be banned. [reddit1](
700K wallets created the 1K/500 USD bubble
Next bubble 7M users and 10K/5K bubble
Then 70M users is 100K/50K bubble
Why doesn't BCT want that info on their forum?
IT IS A REAL ALGORITHM that exposes when to invest in bitcoin and when to sell
@_date: 2014-07-16 19:42:04
From what I read in the BITCOIN ALGORITHM book the key to Bitcoin is it's a free viral digital currency, as far as bitcoin wallets are concerned and that is the fundamental number that is moving bitcoin value.
If you track MY WALLETS as listed at the site bitcoinblock.info I believe is the url, it shows almost 2M My wallets exist.
The Bitcoin Algorthm explains Bitcoin is now a viral digital currency and as My Wallets expand that numbers fraction of the world population determines future bitcoin bubbles.
The Bitcoin Algorithm shows past value growth tied to My Wallets and the math is very simple but it puts order into the chaotic nature of the value swings.
Each tenfold increase in My Wallets creates a new value bubble.
Last tenfold increase was the move from 70K My Wallets to 700K My Wallets which showed a tenfold increase in value of Bitcoin matched the growth.
So the next bubble is 7M My Wallets, we're around 2M now and the bubble peak/value indicator is 1K/500 USD Bitcoin from 700K to 7M wallets, around 7M My Wallets the Bitcoin Algorithm predicts 10K Peak in the bubble and a valley or floor value of 5K USD Bitcoin.
Then just keep doing tenfold increases, 70M wallets is 100K/50K value and 700M wallets is 1M/500K value for the bubbles.

Now that is a reason to be ALL IN for Bitcoin.
Lucky guy took bitcoin at .05 and his bitcoin buys currency in a strip club.

Actually his books sell for 200 on Amazon and he has buyers, he writes about stuff like Domain Name investing (he owns a major portfolio supposedly).
I don't see this new book on amazon yet, but his other books are 50 to 100 bucks on his sites.
He uses the max value on Amazon since Amazon takes 70% above 9.99
You click the Paypal button you see 50 bucks and  the Bitcoin button shows 30 bucks or a 40% discount so he is putting his money where his mouth is, you use bitcoin you save 40%.
So he is standing behind bitcoin, you have the choice, 50 bucks on paypal or 30 bucks in bitcoin, when he puts it on Amazon it will be most likely 200 so he clears what he wants.
His books often explain on Amazon LOOK AROUND due to 70% charge at Amazon the book is priced to net the real value to the publisher.
So he has lots of business books on Domain Names and SEO and PPC etc.
I'm on one of his lists and followed him for years, he was top 50 at yahoo after 911, since he predicted the date using an algorithm it appears for massive terrorism. 911 was the date he gave in 1998 and the post is still archived in Usenet if you want to see him discuss 911 on 9/11/1998 three years before it hit.
Der Spiegel did some stuff on him and the result was after 911 for months he was a top 50 term.
So just watch My Wallets data on BitcoinChain.info that's his key predictor, it hits 7M My Wallets the Bitcoin Algorthm predicts a 10K peak and a valley of support at 5K.
Then it's 70M users and 100K/50K and 700M is 1M/500K
Simple math but a key fundamental to track, market share of Bitcoin Wallets are reported by the top site putting out wallets.

Bring the laptop to a strip club where you know the manager and tell them what you're doing and to headlock the guy if he tries to take your dough.
Oh in the USA, if you do this, you are a money changer and must be licensed now under fed law, so you need to register now with the state to exchange anything of value for money.

The algorithm is very simple and BCT Bitcoin Talk Org is banning anyone that posts a link to that book.
A math genius with many doctorates proved Bitcoin Value depends on simple Trust Factor the same algorithm that Credit Card useage has.
As Bitcoin User Wallets have increased ten fold the value has increased ten fold, so you can now chart the value of bitcoin to users percentage of the population which creates a value based on GWP.
Very very simple fundamental that shows the historic bubbles of bitcoin have all matched its growth curve as a percentage of the population of earth, the same algorithm that credit card transactions follows.
Past values were
700K users 500USD where we are now
70K users 50USD
7K users 5 USD
Next bubbles
7M users 5K USD Bitcoin
70M users 50K USD bitcoin
700M users 500K USD bitcoin
Visa/MC/Amex have 700M cards
700M is 10% of world pop
Total CC transactions of Visa/MC/Amex was 8 Trillion last year or 10% of the GWP
Now BCT is banning any user that links to the book with the BITCOIN ALGORITHM
It's very real and a simple fundamental anyone can use to predict moves of bitcoin trust factor value as a fiat currency like credit cards.
The link in this thread has the book that BCT has BANNED
