Yes I read it. I just didn’t understand the logic at how it boosted exports when, say, 100$ after the devaluing is the same value (purchasing power) as 60$ before when the dollar was stronger.

Oh wow you get paid in cash? Lucky. I wish I could get cash but it’s been a check or direct deposit at the past few places I’ve worked. I hate then having to pay a fee to cash it anywhere other than my bank. I switched to direct deposit after my bank started “holding” my paychecks. I don’t know why but I had almost 600 in limbo for a month back in 2017! That was rough. 
Being only 24, I wonder why we switched from cash to card. I mean, sure, people lost a lot more when they got mugged or robbed but bank hacks do happen and recently the banks have been claiming it’s not their fault so they won’t reimburse the person. It is also kind of nerve-racking sending a family member overseas, who is in trouble, a large sum of cash in an envelope and praying for it to get there as it should.

If you’re not homeless from losing a lot in shitcoins, it was affordable to lose. I’m not saying it couldn’t have been invested better but if you took that loss and weren’t unable to take care of basic needs (food, shelter, water) then you were able to afford losing that money. Either way, this entire argument is semantics; based on how each individual feels what “affording to lose” really means and neither you nor I are wrong. We’ll have to agree to disagree on this particular viewpoint

@_date: 2019-06-02 17:32:55
I did, every 2016th block marks when the software performs a difficulty check and re-adjusts so that a block is mined around every ten minutes. 
“The actual formula is this: at every block N which is a multiple of 2016, look at the time stamps of the past 2015 blocks, and change the difficulty for what follows to old_difficulty*(2 weeks)/(time the past 2015 blocks took).”
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:07:49
The assumption is you understand anything above your basic needs is affordable to gamble. If you can’t feed yourself if you lose a buck, don’t invest. I have a monthly budget, anything above that budget is spending money IE, money I can afford to lose.

@_date: 2019-02-01 02:20:34
Idk about net worth but a common rule of thumb when setting up an investment portfolio is to have a higher percentage of your investment in riskier - high profit (stocks, I count my crypto as this type of investment) and lower in solid investments (bonds) and then as you get older, you move the amount in solid up to close to 40% as you reach 40-50 years of age. 
Age 20-30: 80% stock, 20% bonds
30-40 70% stock, 30% bonds
40-50 60% stock, 40% bonds

Loans would have to be actual money then, unless they tried fractionally reserving the sats too which can get scary without the ability to be bailed out by newly printed money. 
If all the houses cost too much to build, there’d be a drop in demand for materials (builders couldn’t get it) and those should drop in price to reflect that. “Supply and demand” should still work with a hard money system, it doesn’t need printable money. Personally, I believe a business that needs a loan to stay afloat should be closing its doors instead; it’s clearly not busy enough to support itself.

If this is America, even kids need a license to sell food/beverages from a stand
@_date: 2019-04-19 14:18:27
Technically it’s scarier than that because the government doesn’t print money. The government hands over essentially an IOU for the amount of money they are receiving from the federal reserve, which isn’t technically owned by the government. Not accounting for interest, if everyone, including the government, paid all its debts; there would be no more money in circulation. Tack on interest and it’s literally impossible to pay back the debt to the reserve. Give them every dollar they ever printed, and they’d still be owed more money
@_date: 2019-04-30 16:07:06
Yeah, it’s a long con. They know the inevitable end of the dollar; they’re amassing wealth (not fiat; resources and properties/gold) and everyone who subscribed to the dollar/central banking is literally paying for it

@_date: 2018-11-02 13:38:44
So basically writing an IOU for bitcoin that you don’t own. Okay. But if I have one bitcoin and lend out two certificates, they still can’t spend that until I physically transfer the bitcoin to them.  It’s like receiving a check that’ll bounce, it means nothing unless it’s usable
@_date: 2019-01-23 21:10:17

Bitcoin can be “anonymous” if you buy p2p and don’t re-use public addresses. I don’t think there’s a way with a credit card though. Granted, someone could still figure your identity but it’d be a whole lot harder than going through a KYC exchange and using the same public address for every purchase

Yeah but fractional reserve means credit is being created from printed dollars. Banks can give higher loans thanks to it, no? I was under the wrong impression that banks allowing higher loans meant people could artificially jack up the price of property as anyone can technically afford it. I clearly misunderstand
@_date: 2019-09-01 14:34:54
It’s a strong belief. Bitcoin is seeming like the Apple, amazon, or Netflix of crypto. Are there other services that offer similar or better options? Depending on what you’re looking for, yes. However, it was in the right place, doing the right thing, at the right time to become the “leader”. If bitcoin does well, there’s room for altcoins to bloom but it’s hard to imagine a world where an altcoin does better than bitcoin simply due to brand familiarity. 
I love the idea of litecoin and certain other altcoins, but I view it more as the “change” of crypto. Thinking about mass adoption, people are only going to want maybe a handful of crypto to have to deal with. The names already recognized are most likely to be what someone’s willing to accept. No one’s going to want like 50 different “dollars” to keep track of. Business owners are starting to accept bitcoin and I imagine they’ll add LTC and ETH and maybe one off brand altcoin they believe in like Libra, XRP, or EOS later in the future. I can’t imagine wanting to manage much more than that.
Also, personally, I view this as a hedge against the inevitable collapse of FIAT. In high school I had an issue with the credit system but that was probably change-the-world angst. I found myself later researching the federal reserve and the banking system. Fractional reserve practice, and the removal of gold backed currency. How the banks essentially forced the first run that plummeted the economy that allowed them to propose “the federal reserve” to the government. They will drag it along, manipulating it for as long as they can, until it crashes. It will be drawn out but it will happen. Bitcoin has a lot of faith in it, and it’s limited supply means value will truly be based on supply and demand. Money has a lot of faith in it (for no reason), but it’s unlimited supply has created a world where housing prices are through the roof due to how much credit is able to be given. College tuition too.

@_date: 2018-12-24 12:46:54
Well that’s not really the point so it shouldn’t matter too much. The whole point is just to make sure that exchanges aren’t selling bitcoin that they don’t actually have. 
If there’s no issue, that’s fine, most people ought to move a lot of their coins into their wallets anyway. 
If there does end up being a problem, the ones who left their stuff on the exchange are gonna be the ones learning the crypto they “own” don’t exist and were made up with fractional reserve banking practices
If the main goal is to promote “not your keys, not your crypto” and get more people on board with storing their crypto in their wallets then this succeeds inherently. If the main goal is to make sure exchanges aren’t using fractional reserve methods, yes, it’ll fail if we don’t have enough people withdrawing their coins

Only invest what you can.
My personal belief is that there will come a time where spending in bitcoin is commonplace. I don’t know if that means a single bitcoin will be akin to a dollar or a single satoshi is akin to a dollar. Based on numbers I’ve read from people, whom I’m putting my faith in that they aren’t pulling it out their ass, having a single bitcoin will be a big thing and most people won’t have a full one based on the amount total available and will only ever be available and the population

You should HODL in a wallet at the very least, hot or cold. If Cash App vanished, it’d be a real hassle to get the bitcoin you’ve paid for. If your wallet vanishes, you can access your coins from other places as long as you’ve got your private key/seed words
