I didn't buy a complete bitcoin, just toy money, but still. And yeah, a loss of 2k on valuation in 2 hours really sucks.

If you work fulltime minimum wage in the midwest (ie cheap housing), you will be left with ~4k a year for food and everything else after paying rent. You can't live on that amount. Get rid of minimum wage and make bargaining power high again.

Because most of the value, I believe, is coming from these new investors and not the technology. Bitcoin has good technology coming, but many other coins already have good technology and they are worthless
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:57:28
I want to sell whenever spikes, thinking that I will be able to day trade back some of the losses, but then I get scared that it will be a day trade and then the price doesn't go back down after I sell.

Looking at some of the history of minimum wages, it seems as though the minimum wage in 1991 is relatively the same as it is in today's money. It was like 40 cents higher, but it is still relatively the same compared to today, so I guess I couldn't complain too much. 
I would say the larger problem at hand right now is what to do with unskilled labor. It seems like the US has moved out of the manufacturing market, which makes it hard for people without a college education to get much work. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:18:07
No, I bought the dip thinking it bottomed out and it didn't. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:00:31
At least when I went into incognito mode earlier today, there were multiple posts about the price of bitcoin dropping. Hell, the roller coast one had 20k upvotes. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:15:00
I don't know which group you are specifically referring to here.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:29:04
I've said that for years myself. Except the issue is that by the implementation of a minimum wage, the workers tend to lose a lot of bargaining power. I'm torn a little on the situation, but if everyone started to bargain more, then things would be a lot better. Initially upon implementation, there is going to be a tremendous loss as people are going to become desperate and work for anything prior to the system becoming successful. I'm also torn because right now the demand for labor isn't high enough to sustain that kind of bargaining. I would think that there needs to be more demand for labor prior to this system being successful. 
FFS, you can buy different people for different wages in GTA, why can't you do that in real life (at least from the workers perspective). I needed some money when back from college for the summer, so I picked up a food job. My resume had a history of cancer research, a high gpa (pointless in most things I know), and overall a history that would imply responsibility, yet I was paid the same as every other schmuck there and there was no budging on salary / they lied to me, which I should have fought but it wasn't worth it. 
Anyways, I do understand why there should be no minimum wage, but to some degree I also think that is a little idealistic and that demand for labor needs to go up for that system to be successful. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:15:00
That is exactly what is happening. I'll send over some screenshots in a bit, but the total is going up when it is not post only, which seems weird to me.

No Ohio? We tend to get everything. Damn

This looks like something I would never ever put near my wallet. I have no guarantee that the games on the casino are even going to be the slightest bit of fair since they are all electronic.

Even if it is post only?
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:17:23
I mean yeah it feeds itself. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:21:46
But what if the price goes up?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:41:51
But still, whatis the reason for it. Also should i take a 25 percent loss right now, or just hold it out
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:04:43
Funny thing is that even those are disappearing. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:41:35
BTW, I would look at that pricing scheme again. Unless you are moving insane amounts of money, that's pretty hefty.
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:06:25
Inherently in that statement you can see the difference. Rent here accounts for over 2/3rd's of what you make, whereas it accounts for less than half for you. 25 Dollars a week is quite hard, but possible. Add in a phone bill, the cheapest possible being ~25 dollars, and you are left with 1400 dollars for the entire year to spend on anything else. This means everything from clothes to healthcare. The phone is a necessity for most jobs and even job applications. So while it is possible working minimum wage to survive, nearly anything that you need that isn't food or shelter is going to be unattainable. COI is also much higher in the US than in the czech republic. As in, look here: 
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:48:55
Seems a bit extreme
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:20:58
The house that you linked only shows 2 other houses that are going for 1500 a month, so not quite the 430 that you were showing. Additionally, rent tends to still be around 600-800 for single person apartments in the united states. Additionally, As of last year working a minimum wage job and registered as an independent, I had a total tax rate of 17 percent (because state and local taxes definitely do count). Also, your numbers are based off of a high minimum wage in a very low cost of living area. Take somewhere like Ohio, which is much more average, and those numbers I said definitely hold true. So let's redo the math.
Working an average of 40 hours a week with 30 days in a month nets you $1,414 a month, giving $16,971 a year. Taking out 17 percent for taxes gives a total of $14,086 per year, so we are still pretty close even though the wages were different and the tax rates were different. Take out the 600 a month I was saying for housing (including utilities, its a better price this way) and you get $6,886. Except you have to account for sales tax on all of the remaining purchases since we are going to only considering buying goods and what not. Sales tax is 7.75 percent, so that leaves you with $6,352 of buying power. Assuming that food is going to cost a minimum of 25 dollars a week (which is a really poor diet) gives $5,052. Take out a phone payment, and you are left with $3,752. Everything else must come out of that total right there. Clothing, other things that are consumables, any medical expenses, etc. That really isn't that much for an entire year. So yes, it is possible to live on that money, but the other issue I am finding is that with the mandates for providing healthcare, many employers don't want to hire for 40 hours a week. In turn, this means that you are either going to be working significantly more than 40 hours a week with three ish jobs, or you are going to be working under 40 hours a week with two ish jobs. All in all, it is a pretty shitty situation to be in, although you don't have much in terms of responsibilities.

I invested what I could lose, but as a college student, j really would prefer to lose as little as possible. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:47:24
I'm trying to figure out when to cut my losses considering I bought in at 13.5. hopefully I don't screw myself too badly
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:27:04
Onboard with selling? This fucking sucks man. I just bought in today thinking that it bottomed out.
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:20:46
Welcome to the US. Out minimum wage hasn't changed in years, but the value of the dollar has dramatically. The minimum wage when it came out was worth significantly more than it is now since it increased slower than inflation. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:14:15
Yeah, but look at this: 
A lot of FUD is in the top google trends, which is the issue. Once people come to realize that they are all untrue, the price will rise again.
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:57:59
No one would pay if it never got decrypted
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:39:46
Its mainly because a lot of people day traded and probbly put more money in after the spike
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:17:06
I thought it was going to be stable above 112oo, I was wrong
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:52:23
I'm tempted to throw mine on here lol. Lost about .02 bitcoin, which really sucks
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:55:23
Or when it crashes to 2k
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:23:34
Well, I'm hoping that it resets back down to around 10.5k, or a little more. It seems like it really shouldn't be growing that fast and I think there is going to massive correction. I could be making the biggest mistake of my life, but I could also make a massive profit from it too
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:57:46
I don't know if we are at the NWO point that you seem to be talking about. Things are relatively stable now compared to WWII or the cold war.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:13:33
If bitcoin is the good and responsible, why does Satoshi have so many and why is a majority of the bitcoin controlled by a very small number of people who are holding it in vast amounts. Not saying the government isn't corrupt, but bitcoin most certainly is

Something is wrong. It should be going up this fast. If it does, it's going to crash 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:43:26
Price has gone up 20 percent in a day with no reason other than futures, which is a scam. That's unsustainable and has nothing to back it up. Plus 62 million was hacked today alone

I'm guessing its a market correction that I was too stupid to read. I can't imagine venezuela has anything to do with it in the slightest

Something is weong. It shouldn't be going up this quickly. Some kind of manipulation is going on
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:41:42
How were you sending those because thats not usually how fees. Work. Typically you choose the fees you wish to associate with your transfer, and then you send it. Based on the current market status, that may or may not be enough to cover the transfer depending on the demand vs supply of miners

So my question is..... How does bitcoin futures make money when the price of bitcoin goes down?
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:16:45
It seems like nicehash's ceo wanted to cash out and that's what did it

If someone just became a quite heavy millionaire from just finding a file on their computer, that would be amazing
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:08:11
Here's my argument for a bubble. The system, even with lightning technology, isn't yet ready for adoption widespread. We have currently 200k unconfirmed transactions. Not too many places accept bitcoin due to its instability. The price is rising way too fast without a significant enough reason for it, ie impact on the general consumer. 
More minor points: until we get into the realm of satoshis, pricing is hard. It is always compared to USD, and not the other way around. Look at this forum and you will find that everyone compares it to USD/Euro. The US (a decently powerful and wealthy country) still uses the imperial system because they personally like it better than metric. What would make a large portion of the population want to switch to a virtual currency? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:15:33
Almost impossible to predict other than looking at how high the price is
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:38:04

ah, I agree
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:41:09
To be honest though, they are right about this. This is no reason for the spike. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:06:03
I missed that in the news. I guess I could see how that has something to do with it. Still scares me.

@_date: 2017-12-06 22:43:41
Yep, I would agree with that
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:36:50
I think there is way too much market manipulation right now

Nicehash fucked up big time on this one. It wasn't that courageous, especially since there is no legal recourse for this if they did find out

@_date: 2017-12-03 22:15:53
Who in the fuck would support a cryptocurrency that isn't being sold yet, with no proof of work currently, and that is government backed. The entire point of crypto is to move away from governments controlling the money supply, not move towards it. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:51:04
As much as I want to believe you, it seems too odd for the backstory, and also that would be roughly equivalent to 256 million dollars

@_date: 2017-11-30 01:56:01
most are going to say it was such a good week, but i ended up buying high and selling low
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:46:28
No idea anymore. I lost a little when It peaked to 9700 and started dropping. I sold at 9650 thinking that it was going to continue dropping yesterday, only to find out that it stabilized nearly at 9700. So for right now I'm hodling as hard as I can while I wait for money to transfer into the account. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:23:34
I'm guessing it will peak around 10.2k, crash, then spike
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:52:59
Same exact situation 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:16:09
Bought at 10800, sold at 9800, I didn't listen....
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:39:45
at this rate you're probably not wrong, but atm im just holding. This is the one time that I may actually like the BBT
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:39:53
I'm thinking there will be at least one to two more times it'll drop below 9k, but after that it will stay above.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:53:28
It just keeps going down in chunks it's ridiculous 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:39:08
True, there's always the possibility. Either way I'm still putting more money in but the transfers take time. Also I say that because I'm going to sell earlier and hope to buy the dip, which means I could definitely lose money. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:07:43
Well considering I don't know what is going on since all of the exchanges are down, it could be anything. Although the nasdaq's adoption is a good part of it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:01:14
All of it each time because I don't have enough money in yet to just split it. This growth is making me happy but extremely nervous. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:24:36
I'm almost *almost* tempted to pay the damn debit card fees to get the money in here no. I can't tell how much it is going to rise in the next week (should I just cancel the deposit and go for paying the fees?)
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:19:49
There have already been a couple dips, but I am thinking it is going to stabilize for a brief period of like 2 - 3 hours and then everyone is going to start selling as they realize that it is not going to go higher. So far, from what I've seen, it is too turbulent to have an actual crash. Hopefully though, I can see the crash, sell and buy appropriately and not mess up like I did at 7200 lol
Also, i'm thinking a crash around dec 15, and then spiking after the first of the year.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:56:01
Absolutely, I've just been pulling some bad luck and losing the profits that came with the price spike here. In your opinion, try to claw my profits back by playing 100 dollar swings or not?
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:04:58
I really want to not use coinbase and gdax, but they seem to be the best(ish) on the market so far. And yeah, while usually I would be cracking out the card and buying with fees, this growth is making me really really really nervous because it is o exponential, and thus this gives me a reason not to poor a bunch of money in right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:00:26
But I bought in at 10k
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:32:56
Well with the nasdaq announcement, it could continue to go up
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:19:53
Its because they stimulate the market, also don't forget only the maker doesn't have fees, that taker always has 0.25 percent
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:12:19
See my main issue is the barrier to adoption. I want to throw more money at it, but I also don't see anyone actually adopting it widespread.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:24:33
Very true, it was a hard lesson to learn. I bought an extra 100 dollars at 10.8k, but then scare sold it at 9800 (thinking it was going to continue dropping back down to around 8k and then I could buy more bitcoin), but it never did and so I bought in at 10k and just watched as it dropped again. Basically, from now on unless it is some crazy growth that I am 100 percent sure it will fall, I'm hodling. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:39:40
I am in the same camp as you man, and I just lost hard this past day. You just have to grin and bear it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:40:29
3, maybe 4 times a week?

TFW you learn you're worse than hitler
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:02:02

@_date: 2017-11-29 17:15:56
This is pretty much like saying, find out where I dropped a quarter
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:27:37
That doesn't seem like a fair trade for you lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:24:16
Same thing happened to me. Way too many whales going around and scaring me a shit ton. I had some in, and bought some more at 10800, and sold everything at 9800
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:25:02
I believe you'd have to know the wallet you were using, but it is most likely there somewhere, just near impossible to find. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:27:07
Why would you think it dropped that far
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:14:46
Don't. It gets bad.... real bad. All of a sudden you are spending a bunch of time watching markets for only 50, so you throw in another fifty to sweeten the pot, then you throw in another 100, and another 500, and soon you emptied your bank account for cryptos. It is a spiral mayn
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:13:42
See, this is where I am at right now. I am tempted to throw some money in for the christmas crash (prior to christmas) and then buy in big time during the crash and hope that it spikes like a mofo
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:50:59
If I could get back to the number of bitcoin I had previously, I would stop trading and hold, but I don't know how viable it is to get to that. I'm surprised that it hit 9400 today
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:33:17
Yeah, still trying to recover over here and buy dips, but I've been unlucky. My limit orders have always been super close, but never exact. I literally missed a buy in at 9500 area by one dollar... one fucking dollar and I couldn't change my limit quick enough
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:18:20
Hey, at least you didn't buy high and sell low.... unlike some people here
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:31:17
I hope it crashes... so I can buy and recover my losses lol
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:02:53
Probably, I have just enough in so that I care about it and would hate to lose it, but definitely wouldn't put me on the streets. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:31:19
As long as I can make back what I lost, I am all for whatever happens.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:40:17
Hodl hard man, this is a volatile market.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:45:43
So is this why Bitcoin is falling
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:50:29
I experienced both yesterday, but so far it still has quite a bit of possibility
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:27:02
No way unless you had some kind of key tracker. Trying to crack a 24 character code would use a couple million years with current technology. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:05:22
I could see it. This would be a nice rude awakening for me if it is
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:03:56
Same here. I'm guessing another whale. So I'm going to sit here and hope that I didn't lose that much in value. This is starting to get out of hand and I fear for the small amount I have invested in here.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:01:55
I doubt it would go that low, but literally anything could happen. It went up 150 dollars since I woke up today alone. I've never seen this kind of growth beforel

Hey, at least when they get fucked, they get to use lube. All I got was a shitty piece of paper.
@_date: 2018-03-27 23:56:13
The thing is that now if you want the chance of getting jobs in the US, you have to do these unpaid internships. I already the whole crowd going you should not be doing it if it is unpaid, but the thing is that in certain fields, it is basically mandatory and there is no way around it. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:24:34
I mean its a completely valid reason to be worried about a drop, even if the end results many years down the line is better.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:28:10
How in the fuck do you recover bitcoin. Once it's gone, its gone. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:17:24
I'll find the study later, but it is actually slightly more efficient than the typical heater due to how many components release heat. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:22:51
Yeah, no, STEM things. except for engineering, pay little to nothing for your help, and if you don't complete them, you won't get into secondary education. We are talking like undergraduate research and what not.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:02:01
Which is why I'm trying to figure out how to recoup as much as I can
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:27:17
Here is the thing about all of these anti fud things: You have to look at the time to return. In the end you may make some money back, but it is not having those assets for so many years that becomes the problem.
