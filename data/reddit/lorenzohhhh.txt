Are you guys not concerned at all with Tether? It really seems like it might be a scam. Not spreading fud just want some opinions

If you're looking for huge exponential returns like that, check out some of the altcoins instead of the 2 major players.  ICX VEN TRX POE are some decent examples.  not saying to buy any of those necessarily, but do your research and buy what you think has a good use case

no i thought it was obvious that i wasnt serious considering this shows literally nothing. will use /s for simpletons going forward

pretty inspiring. take my upvote sir

You're ignoring a key piece of information here though: If bitcoin (or any other crypto) was to ever be used as a replacement for fiat, these types of 30-40% swings would not really be seen.  These swings  happen due to the uncertainty around each currency and the illiquid nature of each one when compared against fiat.  The current cap of the whole market is only about 500B.  The total M1 supply of USD is about 14 Trillion.  If crypto was to ever get to the point of mass adoption, the price would be stabilized at a significantly higher amount than it is now.

I think once eth pairs become more prevalent and gain popularity, btc will fade. Unless of course, the community improves the code. But as you mentioned, its current state is unsustainable (high feeds low speed)

How are these forks not crushing the price of bitcoin? Isn't it basically a dilution since the coins now coexist on 2 separate blockchains? And are my coins going to increase by 2 for every fork? there's 6 forks coming....

I day trade, so that's why i keep coins on the exchange.  I still am not clear on why binance gave me additional coins and not bittrex.  Is bittrex basically robbing people by "not supporting" the forked coin?  I get the the private keys are basically exisitng in both chains now which gives you extra coins, but then why is this not crushing the price of bitcoin? its basically inflation.  There's 6 supposedly more forks coming  in the next few weeeks.  This seems like a huge problem

Interesting since centralization is the exact thing BTC was made to combat.  Do you personally see any way BTC can becoem more decentralized in its mining method?  With the extremely high cost, it seems hard.  if not, what do you think about its future viability as one of the more centralized cryptos - could it be surpassed by a different coin?

Also, are orphaned blocks really that much of a problem? I would imagine it makes the entire network a bit slower due to redundant data, but how serious is it of a risk?
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:48:18
Oh i can assure you i won't find a way to fix any of these issues.  I'm just trying to understand them haha :P
I'm guessing an "orphan block" is one that hasn't been connected to a chain?  Why would this even occur?
I've seen people say things like, "bitcoin can never be used to buy goods from a store, since it takes 10 mins for the transaction to be processed." BUT, is that even true? If the validation of available funds happens almost immediately, does that 10 minute time to add the transaction to the chain even matter to the store owner?  If it's validated and queued up, what risk does he have? 
Side note: i appreciate all your answers and info. this has been very helpful.  I'm trying to get a really solid grasp on this. I dont like investing in things I dont fully and completely understand
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:01:41
Ah i see.  Why are faster hash rates tied to more orphan blocks?  Couldn't two btc miners find 2 different solutions at the same time? How does the 10 minute length help prevent this?  Is it just because it's more difficult to find the solution so it's less likely that multiple miners will find the different solutions at the same time?
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:00:30
So it's possible for blocks to be blank with no transactional data on them (aside from the mining reward)?
Also, when the block is added (every 10 mins), isn't that the time it takes for the transaction to be validated &amp; completed?  So if theres 2mb worth of transactions (2 blocks minimum of data @ 1 mb/block), it would take a minimum of 20 minutes for all of the transactions to be validated, right?  This seems like there would be a bottleneck and a huge slow down in the validation of transactions as the volume increases
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:03:30
This does help a bit.  My understanding, however, was that a transaction is validated and completed once the block it's on is added to the blockchain.  Is this wrong? is the 10 minute timer irrelevant when talking about transaction validation?  If not, then how would millions of transactions be able to be validated if only one 1MB block can be added every 10 mins?
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:56:46
so as transaction volume increases, doesnt this further slowdown the time to validate a transaction?
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:33:26
Alright, so if the transaction can reach consensus validation almost immediately, then how crucial is the 10 minute mining time to the future viability of scaling btc? is it even relevant?  If the transaction can be validated within seconds, then why does the 10 minute time frame it takes to add a block to the chain even matter?
