perhaps uber should just charge an appropriate rate and give the driver more $

in fact, short term price action seems to revolve around hype, which is fucking shitty for the health of the crypto economy, but now you hvae a bunch of people who would otherwise be ignorant, buying and selling coins. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:15:23
eh... i think BTC will remain as a store of value and grow more valuable as a result, whereas ETH will start to be used for more interesting applications, as it was intended. I strongly disagree that ETH will overtake BTC in marketcap though. I think they'll both grow but BTC, because of it's position, isn't going anywhere. Sometimes, and more often than not in the crypto world it seems, it's not just about the tech...
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:39:22
LOL.. just because you're not smart enough to understand what it's all about doesn't mean others lack your comprehension. I can tell you aren't very smart by your assumption that people buying bitcoin have a 400 credit score. I guess you're just a product of your environment, the same type who voted trump in and ate up all the trash that he shit out, disenfranchised entitled white American who can't see things for what they are... just a guess but probably a good one. Also, this issue isn't isolated to the US... there are other economies which have a similar model that we can point to in worse case scenarios.
Have fun sitting on your 2% a year 401K and when that runs out cause you weren't smart enough to diversify, I promise I'll come visit you during your shifts at Wal-Mart.

Except in modern economic theory, we just print the money to pay the debt without actually backing it up with GDP 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:09:39
Your first two paragraphs are the ramblings of an angry old person so I'm just going to ignore it. I'm only calling you names cause you said I have a 400 credit score and I was offended cause I have great credit and worked hard for it. 2nd, Bitcoins not a currency, nobody thinks it's a currency except people who are either unaware of what's going on or still living in 2011. You're making a lot of assumptions which I'm guessing is a form of "spewing what you've read".  Anyways, you clearly need to accept the fact that YOU possibly just don't understand what bitcoin and ethereum conceptually is, and that fact doesn't represent anyone else's understanding, including my own.

You might be right in theory but you’re incorrect in reality. Yeah, companies might be lying about things and contractors are going to upcharge, but objectively speaking, those investments are probably still going to turn a profit. Bitcoin might be noble and great in theory but it still is a -75% ROI for those that bought in December. I don’t know of any investment other than beanie babies that’s done that poorly, do you? 
@_date: 2018-09-04 20:49:12
Isn’t this the same as the depth chart? Volume of limit orders is already presented in a simple, easy to read format, no?

Yeah good luck buying your coffee with gold bullion. Who said anything about destabilizing the economy? We can't really have bitcoins at this point without dollars. I think the dollar is artificially propped up but that's a whole separate conversation. Bitcoins are "just numbers and letters" the same way that cash is "just paper". You're clearly not grasping the concepts here bubb. Also, do you really think you're in a position to be generalizing about "the majority of bitcoin investors"?? Have you even left your house this weekend? Jesus Christ dude, get a clue. Try and have a basic understanding about something before you mouth off

Wow the beanie baby thing is really interesting. People are always gonna find avenues to launder money.

It doesn’t really solve any real issue... my question is why? 
@_date: 2018-09-04 20:54:57
Got it, that makes a lot more sense now, thanks for the explanation. So I’m assuming the red and green cubes are executed trades?

so did you find a burningman ticket? I really really need one. and i'll buy with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:17:58
They're an arbitrary store of value. Anything more that they might be in the future is icing on the cake. Txn fees are "high" but only in the context of payment processing. They're not so high to scare someone off of cashing out their money. Around 5 dollars, which is nothing compared to brokerage commissions. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 02:01:29
hey, I would love to buy this from you! How can I contact you? Do you have a phone number I can text you at or email address?
@_date: 2014-06-13 00:08:08
can you do that with less risk elsewhere? Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:38:46
can you tell me more about this

Were still probably a trillion dollars of fraud away from this being of any consequence

Actually I think people will lose their money in the same way people lost in crypto. The people who don’t have stop losses in place, are going to watch their money dwindle away. They will keep hoping for a rebound and won’t want to believe that the crash is going to continue. They’ll lose and lose and before they know it their portfolio is worth 20% of what it was 8 months ago.

I guess we’re due for a btc dump from an exchange insolvency. I wonder how low we’ll go. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 18:38:09
Yeah if you procured them without being identified, I can see why you’d want to remain anonymous. However, the govt isn’t going to bust in your house and rob you at gunpoint (ignoring the obvious taxation allegory). Casual Michael might tell rambunctious Rick and then you’d have a problem

Right... this is a great example of someone who is only capable of one dimensional thinking. Just because the concept is “better”, doesn’t mean things will play out how you think they will neckbeard.

Get out of here with your logic. People in this sub always think that because the current fiat system has fundamental flaws, that this is going to fully manifest itself into crises. They want to extrapolate their conceptions of fiat shortcomings into all out disaster. They forget the fact that humans are going to make this shit work one way or the other. It’s such an extreme position to take, I can’t take them seriously. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 06:33:00
I can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic or not. I’ve seen people spout the dumbest shit in this subreddit the past few days that I wouldn’t be surprised if this was an actual sentiment.

Guys this only matters when the amount of money you’ve invested is really insignificant. Nobody gives a shit about your $220 worth of bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:52:24
I clearly wouldn’t know the answer to that. Maybe ask one of those people or ask coinbase? 
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:28:23
Your money is insured by FDIC in coinbase and Gemini and you sound like a twat 
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:28:52
You haven’t clapped back, you definitely haven’t proven me wrong and you’re not even close to forming a coherent idea. Twat is still the best word I have to describe you. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:42:01
Gdax and coinbase but as someone mentioned above, this may only apply to your USD holdings in GDAX/COINBASE... which covers most of your bases as long as you transfer your btc to your own wallet after you buy it 
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:02:37
Dude, go take a cactus and shove it up your ass. Where did I say they aren’t insured? How the fuck am I supposed to know about random individuals personal cases? Are you retarded? I don’t think you’re getting enough oxygen to your brain... I called you a twat because you were preying on a bunch of middle aged women. You still are a twat amongst other things. I’ll say it one more time since you seem to be stuck on stupid. COINBASE AND GEMINI ARE FDIC INSURED. I can’t extrapolate anything further for your slow ass, but I was just responding to someone who was making fun of a weak target and had inaccuracies in their own statement so please kindly fuck off.
