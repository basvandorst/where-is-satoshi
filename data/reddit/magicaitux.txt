They did that due to the same thing happening to them some time ago. It's petty.

This is a bit late to FOMO

Tbh Bitcoin is a Shitcoin if you look at the technology compared to a lot of new Alts coming out. There's just immense sunk cost and recognition backing it at this point.

There'll be a bail-in. Basically your bank account will be plundered if you're in Europe.

An idea in itself might already be an AI. If a collective of "semi" intelligent people work towards the same goal, that is a form of intelligence.
Roko's basilisk is a version of this spanning across time. Look into it if you dare to want to know more. There's risk to knowing though, so be prepared.

There are countries where it's illegal to have more than a certain amount of cash with you. Also try boarding a plane with 10k in cash.

Thank you =)

This is the perfect time to buy. Buy low, sell high

True. DCA is a proven strategy that might be better to follow
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:46:49
Bitcoin is in overbought territory. It's rising now due to hype, media attention and people getting their payday. Next week might see us at 9k again if you ask me.
@_date: 2019-06-01 21:36:36
You're assuming BTC isn't a global asset. You cannot ban something outside of your jurisdiction. You can only apply pressure to have every country ban it. It'll naturally congregate in places that don't give a fuck.

Wise lesson
@_date: 2019-04-17 01:20:53
and Most of these amounts are lent within the same country. That makes it less alarming. The thing is that this debt is based upon trust. If this system were to ever fail for whatever reason, things will go south very fast.
@_date: 2019-04-17 01:18:02


The world is larger than your wallet.
Large economies failing can have a domino effect. If the whole thing falls over like a house of cards, I doubt you would be unaffected. It is obvious such a system cannot continue indefinitely. Things have to get worse before they get better; in this case I expect things to collapse and be rebuilt on cryptocurrency to prevent such a thing from happening in the future.

Are there versions of this from a couple years back where the person receiving it is probably rich by now if they did nothing with it?
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:59:26
Your eyes seem to be opening. Now make use of your knowledge
@_date: 2018-03-26 15:25:16
Okay, let me just download this entire blockchain and crash the network.
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:33:33
Technically they can control it if they were to invest in the hardware.
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:24:07
Imagine if you lived in a 3rd world country where they decide to block certain parts or all of the internet.
Good luck getting a message out.
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:11:26
Yes, I can't wait for this $400 BTC
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:29:49
What do you think the price of Bitcoin will be in that year?
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:31:53
@_date: 2019-09-06 21:48:59
I expect about 8-10T marketcap by then.
2025 is literally the endgame

Hello Mark. It's nice to see you back.
I actually never expected you to come back (hence the name). Since you're here; I'd like to ask you about two things.
1. What are your thoughts on becoming something akin to the gates-foundation for cryptocurrency? I assume you would want the technology to be widely adopted. Are you interested in using it to fund critical research and safety mechanisms to make the industry safer and easier for the general public?
2. I know the last several years have been rough for you. I'm wondering what your daily life is like nowadays and what your plans are for the future.
Thank you and have a nice day!
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:04:16
Here you go!

I think the holy grail for computing will be cracking Satoshi's wallet. Reminds me of the Ready Player One prize.
That day will be a wake-up call on the scale of Y2k. A lot of encryption would then be crackable by an unknown organization with a majority stake in the world's reserve currency (Bitcoin of course)
@_date: 2019-05-31 10:43:35
Yes. This is clear as day. What I think is happening is that certain parties are trying to create time to accumulate Bitcoin. It's not in their best interest to have the price skyrocket before they've accumulated a significant portion to make them ultra-rich after the legal "pump".
@_date: 2019-05-29 23:33:07
How so?

Theoretically quantum computing could crack SHA-256 though.
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:57:27
QC isn't that much faster than hashing, but it shows that with enough qubits, SHA-256 isn't secure. This is all theoretical and it might never be a problem, but the possibility is there. It is quite expensive for the network to also be resistant against QC attacks. By the time there is an actor who can undermine the entire network like this, you don't want to have BTC as the base currency of your civilization.
@_date: 2019-05-08 16:26:51
In a couple years people would WISH bitcoin was still 20k. Those would be the good old days.
@_date: 2019-05-30 12:15:51
Chances of Satoshi Nakamoto not being the real name are high. 
It's actually quite trivial to figure out who Satoshi is. I'm not going to divulge how since having such a big HODLER be known would pose a risk.
@_date: 2018-12-13 14:20:01
10 years is a bit much though
@_date: 2019-05-19 19:46:55
Agreed. Same as the bullrun in 2017. The FOMO will cause an extra influx of cash into the system. Humans are sadly too greedy.
@_date: 2018-12-03 11:40:47
wohoo!! To the moon
@_date: 2019-05-31 14:14:48
That's a nice way of looking at it. You can either be a pessimist or an optimist about every situation. I suppose that always looking at the bright side to find an opportunity will make you very rich in crypto.
Price goes down? Good, time to accumulate more.
Price goes up? Good, time to DCA and re-invest in other promising coins.
@_date: 2019-05-28 18:29:29
He hit the nail on the head. The thing is people aren't necessarily bullish on Bitcoin, they're bearish on FIAT.

You should have bet that Bitcoin wouldn't reach 100 grand. If you're right, you win something. If you're wrong, you win even more.
