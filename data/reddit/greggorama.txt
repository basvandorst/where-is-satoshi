Crypto is risky/volatile enough as it is, so choose Bitcoin BTC, it’s the closest thing to a sure bet, long term anyway. I wish I took this advice myself in 2017.

Yes, deflation strengthens the value indeed. But the risk of losing funds as mentioned, arguably the inevitability of it to some degree, does not help the "store" aspect to store of value.

Bitcoin is more deflationary than the math explains. Lost, forgotten and mishandled Bitcoin will add up over time. Death without proper preparations will certainly add to loss of funds and deflation. This is a challenge to its use case as a store of value in my opinion. Sure, if you've got high value wallets you'll likely take precautions. But most people will not, and the smaller the wallet, the less likely any precautions are taken.

The increase in value from inflation was an implicit point. But regarding the "store" aspect,  if funds can become inaccessible, they were not stored well, regardless of their value. It can essentially ceases to exist. You could bury gold in a field, and forget where you buried it, or die without telling anyone, but that gold is still discoverable. Funds held by trusted third parties can be accessed by benefactors upon death even without a will (after probate  of course). Point is, as people find out that if they are not very careful about handling their keys and take precautions, they may not see Bitcoin as a safe place to store their funds.

Sure, I agree. Nothing is perfect, there's always tradeoffs. But for most people, in 1st world countries at least, storing funds in a bank is much safer. And I too suspect that eventually solutions will be made to address these issues. I know they are services available already. Maybe there'll be smart contracts that, upon death, a notification with keys will be automatically sent to next of kin/benefactor. In the meantime, awareness and education would help.
