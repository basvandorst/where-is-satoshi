That is something different present in older antminers, the version in the newer models is on by default and appears to be designed to only shut off miners.

Sam's incorrect on a few points:


This is actually exactly how the overt variant is [implemented]( in bmminer.


Clearly Sam didn't read the [whitepaper]( all that closely, there are actually 2 variants, one of which can be trivially enabled and disabled without needing separate cores, search for "3.5.2 The Low­Toggle Design". This is the variant Bitmain has implemented based on their patent.


Antminer control cards include a modern FPGA which should have enough processing power to find collisions.


You don't really have to look inside the chip to tell if it has ASICBOOST, you can determine if it's present by sending the right data to it.

To be fair Timo is a scumbag for patenting a mining efficiency improvement since mining competition is necessary to keep mining decentralized. Patents are essentially anti-competitive government granted monopolies and should have no place in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Timo even [tried to sneak]( a modification into Bitcoin to make Asicboost easier without revealing the real reason for the modification. If Timo actually gave a shit about Bitcoin he could offer the patent under the [DPL](

The letter is basically an offensive patent threat, if it was defensive there would be an option to license it under something like the DPL.


If this optimization was released to the public then it would be considered prior art and make any subsequent patents invalid. 


Bitmain should also offer their version of the patent under the DPL.

This patent was filed with the original intention of being used by Cointerra to gain an advantage, so it would not have screwed them over.

This is clearly not true as Timo attempted to make changes to bitcoin that would make Asicboost easier back when he was with mining hardware manufacturer Cointerra.


The issue is not that optimizations are bad, it's that patents are bad, if Asicboost wasn't patented then everyone could just run overt Asicboost and the playing field would be level.
