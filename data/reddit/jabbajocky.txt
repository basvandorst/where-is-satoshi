Jesus. Goxxed again.

Warren Buffet would disagree. He says the US is a very rich country and doing just fine. I trust his opinion, considering his track record.

Satoshi is Mark K?
@_date: 2014-07-04 01:56:39
dream on. The momentum isn't there yet.
@_date: 2014-06-14 21:02:16
Good. I hope they're wiped right out. A warning to other pools.
@_date: 2014-03-15 06:36:56
And a ticket to a citadel.
@_date: 2014-04-09 17:07:16
Ya. It's not like 24% of the population know what Bitcoin is or its the number 1 search on Google.  Oh wait...
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:31:24
Dude, you're living in a fantasy world. We get it. Bitcoin is awesome, but no need to decieve yourself.

I've heard a lot of people talking about the sky falling for nearly 2 decades now. They usually have a look in their eyes like they want to see the world burn. Meanwhile, people who are doing well and look a lot more balanced, aren't talking about such apocalyptic scenarios. It makes me wonder about the intentions of the people making predictions, more than the objective state of things.

I can now die happy. Brilliant!
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:59:29
He's conservative. He doesn't bet on the future.
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:05:56
Because Satoshi didn't fully know the success Bitcoin would have from the outset. As Mark K can attest, things get out of control and there's no going back.
@_date: 2014-06-27 02:24:39
Learn about Bitcoin as much as you can, buy some, and trade some alts. In a few years, the knowledge you glean from this experience might just be more useful than your university education.

Seaman left a bad taste in my mouth with that podcast.
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:33:09
No. Bitcoin is all of that and more. Nothing wrong with making a quick buck. The Internet of money can and should be used for any kind of transaction.
@_date: 2014-10-22 16:56:11
I wonder if it was the high price or the high price relative to the last time they heard of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:56:18
Yes, that's right.  He's interested in the idea that a lot of people are unaware of the world they're living in. They're operating based on outmoded worldviews and beliefs. By focusing on the gun project he was hoping to force the facts into consciousness, and effectively get people up to speed with the new paradigm of open distributed systems and the necessity for people to take responsibility for the power afforded to everyone because of this new cultural stage we're entering.
@_date: 2014-06-23 20:26:54
Yes, for instances where Bitcoin will suffice, we don't need to add anything. But those times where we need a descriptor of Bitcoin, Smart Money is great. Let's just jettison the term crypto-currency. It's just not needed.
@_date: 2014-07-23 17:07:13
I believe the phrase is "gooby pls".
@_date: 2014-06-23 17:29:29
It might come as a surprise to you, but when people encounter new things, they respond very emotionally to the name, tag line and branding. Subtlety is very important. The difference between "Bitcoin" and "Bitcoin - Smart Money" can translate into millions of conversions. "Crypto-Currency" sounds almost like the most uninviting name a person could come up with.
We like to think of ourselves as rational, but it's rarely the case that we are. Emotions and past conditioning are king.

Loved it! It reminds me of The Cat Came Back.

How do I remove a place from coinmap? Went to India Gate the the other night and they no longer take BTC.

Bought today.

@_date: 2014-06-29 22:40:55
So it's centralized? That sucks.
@_date: 2014-04-11 23:49:47
Please don't go away when Bitcoin rallies again, like Darkwings did last time. I'll miss your cute comments. 
@_date: 2014-07-03 20:34:14
This thread makes me think I should sell my coins.
@_date: 2014-03-01 05:17:19
Apparently not.
@_date: 2014-06-30 17:49:22
No. It wasn't an offhand comment. He said it and then defended it repeatedly, in the face of rational criticism. In fact, he still defends it. He's just moved the goal post to infinity.
@_date: 2014-03-14 17:21:42
What will that value be based on? Scarcity?
@_date: 2014-04-25 02:06:20
Try to see this from more than one perspective. One the one hand it doesn't matter, as you say. People will use it, regardless. However, from other angle, it really does matter. Both are true.
@_date: 2014-07-04 01:59:46
The proper insult is Dogeturd, Mr. Anal, sir.

I'm assuming it was properly broadcast because the TX showed up in my mycelium wallet as unconfirmed. 
@_date: 2014-07-05 01:44:57
Yes, you should.
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:34:11
I miss darkwings.  Muforce is not as good at trolling.

Humans have a tough time thinking in terms of exponential growth. Half way through sequencing the genome, we were 1% done.
@_date: 2014-07-10 22:09:40
be careful. none of the people I sent money got it, and there's no way to cancel.
@_date: 2014-07-03 01:44:59
Oh, you Americans and your guns.
@_date: 2014-08-08 16:52:47
THIS is what Bitcoin is all about, facilitating things that can't be done traditionally.
@_date: 2014-06-23 17:08:13
We're in the speculative phase of Bitcoin's development. Of course we care about price.
@_date: 2014-05-12 01:06:42
Because hating white guys is so in vogue right now.
@_date: 2014-07-11 16:12:47
best store of value ever!!

I'm really impressed with this guy. Best troll ever.
@_date: 2014-07-17 02:41:12
Yep, once it's "safe", aka no risk, women will be on board. Then they'll complain about the wealth distribution. Sorry ladies, no risk no reward.

He was probably up straight for a few days. I think it's a good time to take a vacation.
@_date: 2015-01-10 07:06:20
Yep, they were waiting for a signal from the lizard people.
@_date: 2014-03-15 06:17:48
I bet he already wishes he could take that quote back.
