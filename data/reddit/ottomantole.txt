Just because something happened last year don't mean it will happen this year..... more people involved less money at stake

This is crypto life.....Everyone is shitting themselves atm because nobody knows what real or fake news is around the corner to boost or try to destroy it if everyone knew that Korea is not banning bitcoin and accept it with open arms the price would not be so bouncy and on a downwards trend. The decision to buy in or don't buy in is really down to what you want to achieve or what you think bitcoin will become or not become, if you buying in to day trade then anytime can be the right time, if your buying in and waiting for bitcoin to turn to 1million$  and then cashing out then anytime is right to buy let's face it 12k then selling for 1m you'd be happy with, but if your buying in to sell for a short gain of a few K's because you think bitcoin is just a faze then I'd say put 1/3 (1/3 depending on size of investment) of your investment in now if the price drops another 1k ( or what ever amount you feel comfortable) put the other 1/3 in and if it drops more put your last bit in  
This is my opinion no one can tell the future only invest in what you can afford to lose end of the day we could all wake up tomorrow and all crypto is 1$, I'm hopeful for crypto but you never know

@_date: 2018-09-12 13:23:07
It’s not the amount it’s being able to use it
@_date: 2018-08-14 17:07:52
......Or buy the muva fxcking DIP!

It’s only a scam if there’s no white paper.
So bitcoin is legit!

Sounds like he bought   around 10btc watched it go to 20k per coin which he thought he made 100k from and then price crashed and now he’s stuck with the same amount he put in and now trying to pump the price back up! IMO!

So what’s the new taxation in uk?
@_date: 2018-06-07 21:07:16
If you set up 2 folders in your documents or anywhere copy the wallet.dat from the bitcoin directory and keep it 1 of the new folders created as bitcoin 1 wallet.... then from the bitcoin directory delete the wallet.dat ensuring you have the back up in your new folder, once you delete it then start the client back up which creates a new wallet.dat which will be fresh and empty with no encryption then copy that into your second folder now you should have 2 separate wallets and just put which wallet you want to use in the main bitcoin directory...... if you encrypt the wallets with different pass phrases you can test to make sure it works without sending any coins...... I’m no tech expert so don’t take my word lol but I did use this technique for dash and worked for me... although it is a lot of hard work ensuring you don’t mix up or lose the wallets 
I think this is what you’re after
@_date: 2019-04-23 06:54:40
I can’t find nothing on their website that says they accept btc lol
@_date: 2019-04-18 13:12:04
It’s going to range between 2k-6k for at least 5 years, few years after that he’ll get his money back
@_date: 2019-04-23 11:15:11
Bull run is here 
20k in a month! 
100k end of year!
@_date: 2019-04-23 14:22:12
It’s called TA (Technical analysis) it’s what the professionals use. 90% I’m correct it’s that good
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:28:41
I’ve just sold my btc, I didn’t think of it like that thanks
@_date: 2019-04-18 19:40:14
Lol This is my typa guy! You should run the world!
@_date: 2019-04-18 15:31:48
Yes, I’ve also heard btc won’t drop below ‘x’ amount because that’s how much it costs to mine but that was a year ago and it failed miserably, the 4 year cycle is a coincident due to new tech and new market, the new cycle is a 8 year bulll market which we’ve just played out and 2-5year bear depending if you call the start of a bull or an accumulation phase which the accumulation phase is inbetween 2-6k then will sky rocket to 100-300k -at the ass end of 2025
@_date: 2019-04-13 20:54:52
I remember my first beer!
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:27:03
I don’t! I hear heavens only accepting bitcoins, so they coming with me!
@_date: 2018-11-24 14:45:32
It’s a trap!
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:01:56
Well that's fantastic a very smart decision young man. We can put that check in a money market mutual fund, then we'll reinvest the earnings into foreign currency accounts with compounding interests, AND IT'S GONE. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:57:37
Wait until lower prices and then accumulate! Only Fools buy now! 
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:21:04
You’re an ugly c*nt ����
@_date: 2018-11-23 11:56:12
Lol that theory works in the opposite direction too.
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:16:46
1) Download revolut app which is a currency converter (25klimit once approved with id don’t specify its for crypto), 
2) send btc to kraken or gdax coinbase
3) exchange for euros 
4) send euros to revolut sepa transfer
5) exchang euro to pound on the app 
6) send pound to your bank account 
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:04:26
I’d say stop using local bitcoins I think and don’t take my word on it but because it uses bank transfer from a random person if that person rings up their bank after they sent the money and say they didnt send the money someone’s stolen their card to try get the money back, because it’s linked to bitcoin it’s get flagged as fraud and your account gets shutdown, but if you use coinbase, kraken etc.. via revolut, (hopefully coinbase will have cheap direct gbp soon) they are a legit company and understand honest deals to an extent and won’t ring up to try and claim what’s rightfully yours
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:16:53
Noworries! As far as I know ( nationwide, Santander, HSBC are good atm probably more) If you want to find out if a bank is okay with crypto withdrawals just ring them, you don’t need to give account details, I’ve rung nationwide and an advisor said the company has no problems with crypto activity atm, just as long as it’s a legit source he couldn’t elaborate anymore as that wasn’t his job but said just bare in mind of taxes
@_date: 2018-07-07 17:45:12
Yes
