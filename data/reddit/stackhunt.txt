From my perspective. Most alts take something that was unwanted in btc for a variety of reasons (usually most alts ideas come up in the bitcoin mailing list or bitcointalk).
Someone thinks it is cool or mature enough to be implemented right away, forks the code, rape it and give it a new name.
The new alt has the same problems btc had and new problems that were introduced in the fork. Though, with nearly zero tx it is not visible to all.
That is 99.9% of alts.

Most likely you will open a channel to an exchange to trade btc.
As many others will open such channels and exchanges will open channels to other exchanges it will be the only channel you ever need.
In order to top it off you buy btc from the exchange and they will add btc to your channel.

I am not saying Raiblocks isn't a valid or even a great solution. It sounds promising but there was no incentive to attack it until last week. There is no track record so it is very early to call it anything but an interesting idea.

I thought you need more testing less devs.

Afaik it is not on their roadmap. They want on chain scaling.
LN can run on eth, ltc, bcash and whatever...But, it needs testing.
Even on ltc some bugs were found. 
If they add LN somehow, great. Btc will have atomic swaps with bcash.

No. That's what most people do, they trade bitcoins so it will remove the burden from the blockchain. Through that exchange they will be connected to many others. 
Though, unlike the current situation where the exchange is the defacto owner of the BTC, the users will be the owners. 
If the exchange disappears there will be minimal if any funds lost.

Developers can tell what is a quality software and what is not.
If you study the coin and play with it and its code, read the roadmap and understand its implementation than you can tell what is quality software and what is shit that will never work.
Though, can't say the same about any company. I worked at many large companies and non of them even come close to Bitcoin's code quality. They mostly sell mediocre software and high hopes.  The investors never know the real quality of the product but only its relative advantage over current competitors.

If users leave btc than congestion will form on the new crypto as non have L2 solutions while btc fees will go down. When LN is ready it will be posdible to open channels to exchanges with low fees and users will return.

And how is ETH going to handle all the tx coming from users wanting the 4d printer? 
It can't....that is why they are working on Raiden. 
In addition, eth has an inherent problem. As price rise the fees rise and executing contracts becomes a lot more expensive.
Dapps developers want a low fee (low eth value) while investors want higher value and care less about the fees.
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:17:39
You forgot huge demands from nodes due to the enormous size (15kb) of each tx which on scale will lead to a centralization of nodes and a need for trust in 3rd parties.
In addition, still no mobile wallet that I know of.

These nodes gather huge influence as their voting power grows. 
Anyway, these tokens have an inherent problem. Stake holders want them to be scarce so that price will rise while Dapp devs and users want the tokens to be cheaper. 
That's another scaling problem for these smart contract type blockchains.

So here is just a brief thought:
 Exchange and user open a channel that is 1:1. For example: user locks 1 btc and exchange locks 1 btc.
That means that at most the user can double his total btc by buying from the exchange or sell all his coins.
This channel can remain open as long as the user does not want more than 2 btc or if he decides to move his cash to the bank. 
Essentially, zero fees instant transactions with a single exchange.
It isn't perfect but is a step towards a routed payment channels network.

If it is than it is a good time to buy monthly.
You can backtest nov. 2013 to oct. 2016 monthly buy on 1st of each month and you will get about 300% gains. Beats every other investment.

Only legacy addresses will die. 
It was demonstrated in the past that some wallets don't use random number generators correctly and make it easier to find the private key. That's a better option than pure brute force.

Where I live it works this way:
Let's say you earn 5k$ a month brute.
1k$ goes to pension (800$ paid by the employer).
500$ goes to ira (400$ paid by the employer).
1300$ taxes including healthcare.
You are left with 3300$ net salary.
Rent is about 400$ for a room in a shared apartment.
Food about 250$.
Transportation about 200$.
Unlimited cellphone is 10$ for a 24gb data plan. Electricity 20$, water 10$.
600$ other expenses not necessities.
Savings: 1500$ pension/ira, 1800$ savings from net salary. Total 3300$.

I buy it monthly no matter what.

Volume is fake, especially on Chinese exchanges.

3 years is not a long time. It's been over 5 years and gold still have not recovered, not even close.

I have a certain amount to spare.
I save 100% of my monthly net income (if you include the 30% of my brute salary going to pension and ira). 10% goes to btc monthly and let me tell you I am extremely happy with it.
I know btc fundementals are improving and I am sure that when the next wave hits, users will have a better experience.

I witnessed narratives change.
Where I live people use crypto all the time to pay for stuff. It is called colu and people charge it with fiat and buy stuff with it. since it is easy, fast, secure and cheaper.
Why? There is no vat since it is not a real currency.
A merchant gets colu and can then pay with it to suppliers for goods without moving to fiat.

But innovation comes out of Bitcoin.
Most blockchain research papers are by bitcoin devs or conducted by universities on Bitcoin.
For example: Bulletproofs was invented by Bitcoin devs and was recently adopted by Monero.
It is not implemented in Bitcoin since it is not scalable.

True but the big 4 (google, facebook, apple and amazon) pay very little tax, employ a fairly small amount of people, destroy any competition, hold a huge market share that is unheard of in any other industry and even risk public security (like with Russia encouraging racial violence through facebook).

Because you are US centric.
The USD lost its value about 10% compared to world currencies in 2017.
That is a lost of American purchasing power.

Litecoin is a separate chain (own genesis block). It is not a hard fork of Bitcoin.

Unlike in the US you can't open a brokerage account with less than 6000$. 
So, crypto is a more viable option for kids.

If it is just a few dollats it is good to accumulate in a single address as you do not want to get stuck with dust when fees rise.
Either that or make sure to send them to a single wallet once in a while (more costly fees wise).

Or....it was simply the headline of the Times that day.
It's like all the crazies looking for cryptic messages in the bible.

If you were an ico, which ico would you be?
Did you speak with inmates about crypto and the freedom it can offer them?
What is your favorite Japanese pro verb? 
Is crypto a fraud or just you? 
If you could travel back in time to 2008, would you kill Satoshi or wait for 2014 to kill bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:57:01
Date is not enough as you can write whatever date you want in the genesis block 
That was the main headline as far as I remember.

They blocked aws and google cloud IPs turning their sh*thole country to a much greater sh*thole.

Did you try earn.com? You can get paid about 1$ in btc for every message and they send a few every month.
Also, look for a remote position in a crypto company. You can find many on Angelist. They will pay you in crypto instead of usd. 
Also look for Jameson Lopp site, he has some crypto job boards links.
Another option are bug bounties. Look for companies that offer them.
And there is also Steemit that can get you a few more dollars every month.
