Digital money enthusiast need to realize they are not at war with one another.  Threads with topics like this only serve to further bash a coin that is actually helping greatly in the digital money atmosphere. 
For the most part Dogecoin community look at Bitcoin as 'Father' and Litecoin as 'Big brother'.  Its very hard to talk about one without including the others.  You might be in denial but Dogecoin has attracted a great number of newcomers to Digital Money.  
You wanna bash a coin, go do it to something not in the top 15.

A large problem, I am sure many miners experience is the massive amount of bulky cords hanging around because of their PSU's. While most are not being used and shorted with a paperclip. Among this, most PSU's are now smart and are hard to tell if they are indeed still on(Fan turns off). I got frustrated with this and decided to come up with a solution, for Modular PSU's. I Present to you my Switch! ...I've been told it's stupid and useless. What say you?
