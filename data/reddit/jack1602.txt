This is indeed interesting. I guess the question then would be *when* to switch - by the time us mortals learn about QC being a reality it may already be too late and unwanted inflation may have already happened on the EB side... Would there be a way of detecting this?

The problem here is that knowing you are a BTC hodler, if I decide to fork BTC into whatever forkcoin on my own today, your wallet will have funds in my forkcoin chain. Funds you didn't have access to prior to today. Sooo did you receive virtual currency in 2019?
Your private key certainly got access to new coins in a new forked chain in 2019. Claiming you "didn't know" or "you didn't want them" won't save you from having "lied" to the IRS.
In theory, the IRS could create IRScoin in secret and if you answer No to this question and they later find out you were hodling BTC at the time they created the fork, technically, they should be able to go after you because you lied.
Besides, of course, the obvious "did you move coins you had access to from one wallet you owned to another you owned?". If so, did you "receive" coins in the new wallet? I mean, I guess so...?
Plenty of examples of how little sense this question makes in the context of blockchain.

And then the fucking pandas eat it all. Whale pandas.

Doesn't Samourai's Paynym (BIP47) solve this?
