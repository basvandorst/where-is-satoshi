Okay but say you don't like the company that maintains the one road you use to get to whatever entities you DO want to do business with, your choices are a) deal with an unregulated giant with many times your resources who has realized you have, relatively speaking, zero power or b) stay in
So yeah, I guess you are right, this system DOES give you choices, my bad
Choice is essential to a fair market
Capitalism is essential to have choice, particularly regulated capitalism for things like utilities which you obviously take for granted.
We are already having problems with tv/phone/internet providers being underregulated at consumers' expense, what makes you think less regulation would help that?
I agree that it would be dope to be left to make my own choices, insofar as it fits into the benefits I like receiving.

Okay except we got here through the question of paying taxes. I guess in your fantasy all governments are dissolved so what, private companies take care of the infrastructure? We already have serious problems with that a) and b) no you wouldn't voluntarily pay those companies lmao, or at least most wouldn't, so they would charge out the ass to use the infrastructure.... 
Unless you just want to live primitive in a cabin in the woods (which you can do now btw, our system allows for it) then you want society, which government of some sort is a natural result of, for better or for worse.

I agree that it would be dope to be left to make my own choices, but it's also unrealistic to expect to make some of those choices while receiving all of the benefit of living in a first would country.

It's been proven repeatedly that lessening regulations on the companies that have effective monopolies on our infrastructure do nothing but harm to you, and I, the consumers. What about your fantasy would change that fundamental truth?
