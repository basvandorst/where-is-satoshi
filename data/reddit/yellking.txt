I respectfully disagree.  After reading this whole thread - that means Uncle Joe would be telling someone that he sent them 10,000 dimes?  Unless I'm missing something.
I agree that as it stands is simply way too confusing for the critical mass (in the U.S. anyway) to understand.  The hundreds of people I've spoken to about Bitcoin, when it gets into the decimals and nomenclature, that's when the lesson and the understanding starts to fall apart.

Right on.  Very cool.
Ivan - you seem pretty dialed in with this - I know this is a giant leap forward - but if I wanted to find coders who were capable of working on such a platform (the music or photo embed), do you have any suggestions as to what kind of programmer I'd want to seek out?  Aside from working knowledge of the blockchain and bitcoin processes, should someone have a specific computer language skill set that I should be looking for..?

Maybe I'm missing something here, but how or why would anyone mock this small bit of news?  Know him or not / like his name or his music, or not / this guy has 5.8 million Twitter followers - and I would venture to guess that most of them are in a demo that follows trends, blows up trends, spends money, etc.
If teens and young adults hear that someone they dig is into something - what do you think those teens and young adults flock to in droves??  As much as Bitcoin needs the older male generation to pour millions into building the ecosystem, etc - it's the kids that are going to A) make it "cool" and B) turn Bitcoin into something that them and all of their friends talk about and want to use on a daily basis.  "Hip" may be something to mock, but it's also how things most people have never heard of become a part of mainstream society.
If another teen idol of sorts was very knowledgeable about Bitcoin and, for argument's sake, went on a tour speaking to high school students across the country - do you have any idea how fast Bitcoin would blow up here in the U.S.?   I really feel like it's not the parents who are going to get Bitcoin where we all think it's going to wind up - it's the kids, man.  If that generation turns onto Bitcoin, then it's on like Donkey Kong.
Just my two millibits.

Not one upvote!?  Not one comment!?  C'mon everyone!

What about giving bitcoin to someone who's not already branded a politician but is more than capable of handling the duties of the office?   No one has to have a political resume to be elected (i.e. Obama).  If Dodge can sponsor a car, why can't bitcoin sponsor a viable candidate??

Makes sense.  And the benefits to preparing the transaction for later execution?  
To allow for an if / then scenario where something else is pending..  
To allow for X amount of time passage prior to execution..?
To use the prepared bundle as an instrument or deposit or escrow..?
I think I'm getting it.  Am I on the right track?

Nice.  I give Rogan credit.. he's come a long way in the three times that Andreas has been there.  Rogan started out without any knowledge whatsoever, almost to the point of laughing at the idea of it all.  But now he seems, and I think he even said out loud, 'convinced' that this is going to change the way our financial world works..
I still wish he'd spend some more time on task and apply himself to really wrapping his head around it.  He's a smart guy and is fully capable of it.

I don't recall ever submitting any of my private keys onto the block chain.

Joe needs to do some more homework to give this exchange justice.  I know he has a full plate, but if he brings more to it, it'll be that much better of a Round II.

Nice work Mike.

Do it. There's illustrators everywhere who will help.  Look in your area on Craisglist or just search for any nearby.  You can do the whole thing via email anyway.. good luck!

Given that this would be based on current fiat / BTC exchange rates:
If I someone asked me "How much is a pack of gum?" - priced in Bitcoin - what would I say to them?
If someone asked me, "How much is a ticket to a movie in a movie theater?" - priced in Bitcoin - what would I say to them?

Yeah, at 1:45:57 you can actually hear Rogan's brain turn into a pretzel.
I guess that's it in its simplest:  
1s and 0s from one end of the transaction (keys) that are coded in order to embed them amongst existing 1s and 0s of a music or photo file, and then they're uncoded on the other end, for use in order to complete the transaction...

This is huge!!!!

My grandma is still confused.
I know that simple consensus isn't there yet and that there are large players in the space who are steering this nomenclature in part due to the nature of their businesses and customer interactions.
But my grandma is still confused.
(On another note - where can I find the ฿ character to install in my fonts..?)

Well done!
Clearly the headline with a quote by Senator Antonopoulos fell down to Page 2...
@_date: 2014-04-04 21:16:02
It wasn't an advertisement.  It was a note written to express a job well done and to convey a vote of trust for someone who is helping sure up an ecosystem that can use every bit of 'trust' and a 'job well done' as possible.

Time for Andreas to run for office.

Who's going to put out the first state rule-book, to protect users of Bitcoin from state fraud?

I will thanks!  Not to steal anyone's (or this particular book's thunder), but I published this last summer..  Not specifically for kids, just as an easy first step into the world of bitcoin.
