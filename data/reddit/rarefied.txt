That's not what has been described here.  In the hypothetical scenario Sally has transmitted a transaction sending BTC to Ron.  The attacker is then posited to have the ability to instead say "no Sally sent BTC to George."  This is impossible unless the attacker has Sally's private key.  It is possible for the attacker to say "no Sally did not send BTC to Ron" or even "Sally never had those BTC in the first place" if they mine a chain back to when Sally was originally transferred those coins, but they can never say "Sally actually sent those BTC to George" without her private key.

A 51% attacker can double-spend his own coins by transmitting a transaction that gets included in the public chain and then mining a private chain, including a new transaction for those coins and removing the old one, until it's longer than the public one and then broadcasting that chain.  The 51% attack allows the attacker to decide which transactions make it into the blockchain and to receive all the mining income (eventually).

First you go to college and learn computer engineering.  Then on weekends and after work you design a microprocessor from scratch so you can be sure the design is not backdoored.  In the meantime start shopping around for equipment with which you can build and package the chip, and make sure to design and build an electron microscope so you can verify that your real design was actually built.  Design and build some RAM and a few supporting chips for things like text or video input and output.  Write a simple BIOS and get your computer to boot.  Keep in mind that you must only operate this computer inside a Faraday cage twenty or more feet underground to be sure that no one can steal your private keys by capturing electromagnetic radiation from it.
At this point there are a couple of ways you can go. You can write your basic OS and Bitcoin code in pure machine code but it would probably be best to write a compiler-assembler-linker suite for your favorite higher-level language.  This will make writing the OS and Bitcoin software much easier, and you're essentially in the clear.  Once the software is written run it on the computer in your Faraday dungeon and print out the private key and address, or write them down if you didn't build a printer and associated I/O in your computer.
Send all of your insecure bitcoins to this new address.  At this point a thief will knock you over the head with a blunt object and steal the paper with the private key on it.

@_date: 2014-01-09 13:40:39
So much disinformation about the 51% attack in these threads.  An attacker **cannot** arbitrarily reassign Bitcoin balances among users!  If Sally sent Ron 5 BTC, the attacker cannot later change that to "Sally sent George 5 BTC" without Sally's private key because Sally's private key must be used to sign the new transaction.  What the 51% attacker can do is remove Sally's previously-confirmed transaction to George.  The attacker can also eventually ensure that they receive all mining rewards by mining on their own chain until it is longer than the public chain and then broadcasting.
The 51% attack is scary but it's not "ZOMG they're gonna steal all the Bitcoins" scary!

I think you mean inflation not deflation. The standard Keynesian stance is that higher prices in the future incentivize current consumption (and therefore economic grotmwth) while lower prices in the future result in hoarding. The Keynesians are wrong, of course, and there's nothing wrong with a fixed money supply. Read up on the Austrian school of economics to find out why.  is a good place to start.
@_date: 2012-10-08 13:52:13
The daily volume of bitcoin transactions on Mt. Gox alone is already significantly larger than the total coins mined in a day. The reward halving will not have a "supply shock" effect on price.

They're not just busy work.  The block hashes calculated by Bitcoin miners are used to secure the transaction history contained in the block chain.  All of the value of a BTC comes from the trust that people put in the accuracy of the transaction history, and the very large number of hashes required to forge any part of the block chain help generate that trust.  Therefore, Bitcoin hash mining is useful for society.

All someone in a free (to export cryptographic implementations to Iran) country has to do is look at the Wikipedia page and write a free-as-in-speech implementation of SHA-256.

Why will there necessarily be "greater demand" for BTC after the reward halving?  All of the demand for BTC is balanced against all of the supply, which at the halving will be 10.5 million coins minus coins in lost wallets.  This is true whether the nature of the demand is for speculation or for commerce.

This is interesting.  Am I understanding correctly that all you need is an unbroken chain of transactions that lead from the transaction that mined the coins to their current unspent state?  I'm having trouble thinking of transactions that could end up getting pruned here; maybe some coins cycle around a few addresses and end up at the same address twice?
If A, B, C, and D are addresses and -&gt; denotes a transaction:
A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; B -&gt; D
In this case you don't need to keep the B -&gt; C and C -&gt; B transactions around I guess?
@_date: 2012-09-21 17:57:37
According to  mtgoxUSD has traded 1.37 million BTC over the past 30 days.  This is 45700 BTC per day on average, which is 6.35 times as many as the average number of new coins being mined per day (24 times 6 times 50).  A significant majority of the coins traded per day are not brand new on just one exchange in just one currency, and therefore the effect of the reward halving will be minimal.

I'm a big proponent of the store of wealth aspect of Bitcoin as well.  The existing infrastructure for actually buying stuff just makes a lot of sense to me and I don't see Bitcoin replacing a lot of that.  Some fun things to think about:
* [CNBC puts global wealth at 241 trillion USD.](
* [World Gold Council says that 171,400 tonnes of gold have been mined.](  This is equivalent to 5.597 billion troy ounces and about 7 trillion USD at today's PM fix.
* Divide 7 trillion USD by 21 million bitcoins that will be mined eventually and you get a "store of wealth price target" of 335,000 USD!

A money order costs about 75 cents and has to be physically delivered to the person receiving it.  Bitcoin is 2/3rds that price and is delivered in about an hour or less anywhere in the world.
Oh and you can get away with a much lower or even zero fee if you don't mind waiting for the transaction to be included in a block.

Pretty much all ETFs work this way.  Certain large firms are able to trade large blocks of the ETF shares for large blocks of the underlying assets or vice versa.  Then the ETF shares can be traded individually on the public market.  For example, my favorite ETF [VTV]( is created or destroyed in blocks of 100,000 shares as best as I can tell, but I buy a few shares twice a month as part of my regular investment program.
So you'll be able to buy individual shares of the Bitcoin ETP if it gets approved, no worries!

Unfortunately in the U.S. this may not be legal.  We are only allowed to exchange messages with other countries of a technical or personal nature that do just justify the usage of other public communications services.  In short we're not allowed to carry "important" traffic internationally.
We are also not allowed to use codes or ciphers to obscure the content of messages.  This is a bit of a gray area with Bitcoin however since we'd just be transmitting publically available information that relies on "codes and ciphers" for its meaning.

I dislike this idea because firstbits are prone to mistyping while a full address is not.  This is a problem particularly for short firstbits strings.  Widespread adoption of firstbits would result in people mining addresses with "similar" firstbits in the same way that people now register misspellings of popular domain names.  In a system where transactions are irreversible I think the inconvenience of typing a full address, which includes an embedded checksum and is extremely hard to mistype in a way that sends your coins to an unintended destination, is a small price to pay.

An ounce of gold is over 1,000 USD, which sucks because it's hard to give someone 1/1000th of an ounce to pay for something worth a dollar.  This problem does not exist with bitcoin where we are free to use a reasonable prefix for every different transaction.  There's no need to standardize on a single one.  Selling something for a dollar?  Ask for one mBTC.  Selling a house?  Put "500 BTC" in your MLS listing.  One gigabyte of data transfer to the Internet on AWS?  100 uBTC.

When I mined I did so at Slush's pool.  He shares fees and charges a reasonable 2%.

This has to be a joke.
Oh wait, you're serious?  Let me laugh even harder then :-P

While I agree that something like Bitmessage is the long term solution, currently we have a world where most sites require an e-mail address to sign up.  If you'd prefer that neither they nor anyone else be able to connect that e-mail address to you what is the solution?

Your "win 40k after 10k bets of 200" scenario is easily calculable in a single line in MATLAB/Octave:
    1 - binocdf(5099, 10000, 0.495) = 0.0014 = 0.14%
Here we are calculating the probability that he won 5,100 or more out of 10,000 bets with a win probability of 49.5%, which is the win probability for a 2x payout using a 1% house edge like just-dice.  If he wins 5,100 out of 10,000 bets then he is indeed up 40k coins:
    5100*200 - 4900*200 = 40000
However this is not what the bettor is doing.  Instead he has been using a sort of "reverse Martingale" strategy where he doubles his bet on a win up to near the maximum bet and halves or quarters it on a loss down to some minimum bet.  Such a strategy will produce long winning streaks at large bets and long losing streaks at smaller bets.  This feature of the strategy, coupled with a small house edge of just 1%, creates extremely high variance even though such a bettor will go broke eventually just like any other.  I haven't tried to work out an exact formulation of the house profit distribution against this strategy but it's fairly obvious that it will not be close to that of the "spam 200 coin bets" strategy.

Except they weren't lost.  The fork just caused confusion about who mined those blocks and which transactions were confirmed until a concerted effort brought everyone back on the same longest chain.

Well you could still save, thereby giving up OMG experiences today in exchange for ZOMGWTFBBQ experiences in the future.

Gold can be physically searched for and seized.  There are ways of storing BTC that require torture to seize against someone's wishes.

In general the deflationary concern is that people won't spend money on things they don't need.  This is, of course, a big part of our current economy and there would be some pain in changing over to a system where money was spent more judiciously.  Of course we would all be much better off as more capital would be built up in the economy allowing for better standards of living for everyone, but for the powers that be it's much easier to goad the unintelligent into exchanging their wealth for a new phone every six months.

Well it would leave them open to being shunned by the market after they are found unable to process withdrawals.  I think that would happen pretty quickly as it's obviously exploitable.
