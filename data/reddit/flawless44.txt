Bitcoin is open source and anyone can do those things. That's why there are many bitcoin forks. Whether or not any of those things work depend on how much support they have. It's not like bitcoin core developers can make your bitcoin disappear tomorrow, and double the coin limit. Their change (hard fork) would not be accepted by the community, and regular bitcoin would continue on as normal.

Crypto is both an asset and a currency.  You can use and treat it many different ways. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:34:54
To continue your analogy...
No it's not. The xanax was worth what it was worth and so was the bitcoin at the time.
If you hold bitcoin, you are holding a volatile asset. Its use as a currency needs to take that into account. It is not reliable for stability. 
Just as you do with stocks, bonds, and cash.. you trade into and out of asset classes that have the properties necessary for you to get what you want.
Bitcoin is a volatile, historically deflationary asset, but one that can be transferred quickly anywhere In the world nearly instantaneously, and if done correctly, with no risk of seizure or scrutiny. Unlike many other assets. 
It also has huge potential for expansion as you can treat it like a technology stock, which is In active development. It is a good possible alternative for the risky portion of an investment portfolio. 
If this kind of asset is not something you need, or want to risk funds in, then look away.

What's with all the trolls lately about socialism being the root of all evil? 
Venezuela overrelied on it's oil production, underinvested when it had money, and is now being crippled by sanctions. 
For a good example of socialism being at least somewhat properly implemented in combination with a dictatorship like government, look at Vietnam. Fastest growing economy in the world.

People have been dying of various causes throughout history. 
You can similarly use that argument against most religions, governments, and economic models. 
Some are better than others but ultimately it's a human being pulling the trigger. 
(Armenian genocide - monarchy, slave trade/ native American genocide - capitalism, I'm sure you have plenty of examples for socialism and communism)
If we use death to measure effectiveness of society we will get completely derailed from the point. And that is, which ones, or which combination is best overall. 
IMHO, that would be a mix of capitalism and socialism. Give the opportunity to achieve whatever you want, while providing some support for those at the bottom so they can work their way up, and soften the fall for those that fail.

You can alter old blocks, but you will make all the ones afterwards invalid. So to alter old blocks, you need to alter all the ones after it, and mine them aswell for other clients to accept your modified chain.

It's still a fair criticism, especially since  coinbase now requires identity verification to move any amount of crypto.

Bitfinex. You don't need leverage and you don't need 5 million, but a lack of those things will limit your returns.

Is bitcoin money or property? People seem to treat it as whatever is convenient at the time. Because you can buy property with a credit card, so why not bitcoin?

No, it is just concern trolling. You can encode anything to a public system. Even if you get rid of the OP return, you can encode stuff using vanity addresses and dust transactions.

There is no limit of losses against gains per year. However, if your losses exceed your gains, the amount you can deduct over that is only 3k.
So if in year 2018, you realize gain of 200k, then one month later realize loss of 210k, you can deduct 203k. In later years,. your remaining loss of 7k carries over and you can keep deducting it by 3k every year until it's gone.

Exactly the same is true of most companies because they don't pay dividends. Your only method of profit is price appreciation, and their stock may drop to zero before you can sell.
Your bitcoin investment is a contribution to the development of the bitcoin protocol by contributing to it's increase in price.

Yeah, probably in the past when it was cheap. Regardless, it doesn't matter. A public ledger will be abused. There is no way around this without centralization. This is a symptom of the world we live in. Treat the source of the problem. People.

It is gambling. The house wins when the coin lands on the side :P
But, games of chance are generally considered gambling. You're not investing in something that has the potential to grow. You're just playing a game to exchange money based on chance and partially skill.

Betting your friend is playing a game of chance which is also gambling. Investing in crypto is not playing a game of chance and does not involve a house edge.
Bitcoin can be treated as a currency and an asset. Buying it can be considered to be buying into it as stock.

When you gamble, the house is guaranteed to win. That is not the case here. That's what makes this an investment, albeit a risky one.

It is technically correct, but the amount of data you can store is limited. Even then this just makes a good argument for why you can't effectively ban certain imagery. Just wait till they find a prime number that decodes into kiddie porn just like that other prime number that decodes dvd's.

The current default I think is that the transaction will stay unconfirmed for 2 weeks. But anyone can rebroadcast it to renew it, so it can potentially never clear if it isn't invalidated. Your best bet is researching how to use an existing wallet provider to rebroadcast the transaction with a higher fee. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 17:30:30
The money basically never left. You still have it. The problem is the UI is telling you otherwise, and may prevent you from sending transactions it thinks are invalid. 
Use another client that will let you send another transaction. Send it with a higher fee so it will confirm. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:13:23
Ha! I knew all my passwords and sold at 1400 $, jokes on you!! ... ... ... ..  :(  
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:18:34
Sorry let me rephrase. Your best bet is to research some wallet software that will allow you to make another transaction trying to spend the same coins, but with a higher fee. This is technically trying to doublespend them.
Basically you just want to spend the coins by sending them to an address that you own, with a high fee to make sure it confirms. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:43:50
I don't know of any. I'd have to look around and find some. You should be able to do it. Google is your friend. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 18:21:51
Yes. If you make another transaction with a higher fee, it will likely confirm before the other older one. 
I don't think you can do it on mobile. You can look this up. Some wallets may allow you to rebroadcast a transaction, like electrum. Otherwise you may have to make a manual transaction.

 The potential hard fork that would increase the block size and implement segwit. Did you read the OP?
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:57:33
There is a setup, security, and maintenance cost which you have to take care of yourself, but after that it is the minimal cost that is advertised. 
This alternative is one that credit cards don't offer. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 21:36:12
Sorry, I don't know about the specifics here. I just read it as a notice to move your coins to an address you control before any potential fork. The wallet provider is not important.

@_date: 2017-06-20 03:52:55
But that's just an initial cost. After that cost is paid on the blockchain, the connection will stay open for a long time, potentially indefinitely right?
As far as infrastructure, it can be crowdsourced pretty much just as nodes currently are. As anyone who can setup a machine to run a client can also open up a lightning connection to recoup the cost of running the client on a dedicated machine, or having their PC online at night in their home office running core.

@_date: 2017-06-23 21:10:08
Replay is just someone rebroadcasting a transaction to the other chain because it is just as valid. To prevent this, it cannot be valid. To make it invalid requires some sort of change to the way blocks are written in the new chain as part of the hard fork.
