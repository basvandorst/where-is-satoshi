Just to take a few dozen Hex things and turn them into Base58 ones that start with the "5". Just getting a better understanding on how everything works and whats available out there. It seems from what i read that even with the main bitcoin download that the only way to import an address is in something called wif and armory is the only wallet that lets you import from the hex stuff so there has to be something out there for a person to change hex to base isnt there. since armory is about the only wallet i found that you can import hex addresses with it would be silly not to have a program to convert them.

Ok, that all makes sense, i have been playing around with it on armory now that it loaded the chain thing.
I found a recipe for turning that hash mess into something called Base58 which is suppose to be easier to use. Does anyone know of a tool that will convert a list of Hex into Base 58. Not one single hex, but like a list of 100 in a txt file?

Bitcoin wiki is not new person friendly at all. Even some of the "power users" i have talked to have told me that unless i have a degree in several different fields of engineering, cryptography, etc that the wiki will just confuse me. Which it does. Just because it makes sense to you when you read it does not mean that it makes sense to everyone, or for that matter 50% of the people who look at it.

I almost forgot, something in windows is preferred. I know all you guys are like super techy and stuff, but i couldnt install an os on a computer to save my life to use linux.
