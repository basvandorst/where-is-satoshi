I'd be interested why it's not a hardfork? Is it because bcash is not bitcoin, and so bitcoin itself hasn't changed? Or is there another reason like bcash not having the longest chain? If it is the former, I'd disagree. Non-bitcoins can also hardfork. For the time it survives, it's a hardforked altchain, not?

Yes, no matter what you read (science, newspaper, ...) you should always know who wrote it / funded it, so you can put it into perspective.

Reading upon it, it's easy to find all sorts of both supportive and denying texts on Rothschilds still being a wealthy family. What would you say is the most reliable basis for an estimate of their current wealth?

You mean taking inflation into account?

Of course, if you do so that's also fine. For me it helps to know whom I getting information from as I can't always read up everything. In case of journalism I sometime can't even verify every bit of information. So I'd stick to it:

That in particular is what you read a lot upon on the rather lurid-end of the scale of texts. But while it seems reasonable, it's hard to find any evidence. Sure there should be solid traces when a family has been in theses businesses for so long. As much as you'd want to hide it, mistakes are always made along the way. Being such a popular topic, I guess there should be competent people investigating it, PhD works maybe and the like. A link to such a review piece was rather what I was asking for. That would be very much appreciated.

No, I haven't so far but I will. Thank you.

Weren't Belshe and Silbert on the same s2x boat? They even look the same.

There's a difference between legality and legitimacy though. Not all things lawful are necessary right.

And then what? Direct ruling forever will not work within the EU. New elections? The movement will probably come back stronger. 
Sentiments what EU can and cannot do will shift when Spain follows down the road of violence.
The catalan society has one ace up their sleeve and its social mass. They now have to show that they truly are one nation, have to defend their leaders peacefully against a fully equipped paramilitary unit.

Thank you,
this was a great insight! See, I come from the other end of the time line. I was basically out soon after the mt gox crash or even before that.
There's so much information out there and it is hard to screen it all. Right now, both sides accuse each other of being sponsored/corrupted. I think you're argument is totally valid and I think Bitmain has a lot of incentive to manipulate in their favour. Who wouldn't. However, I have to admit that I also buy the argument of the other side. It's plain to see that there's business to be made with the scarcity of blocksize in several ways. So it is most likely to me that both sides have strong financial support in their back.
Coming back after 6 years and seeing three developer (which I became to know as very responsible and reliable) gone from the team, just gives me a very bad taste. You know? So I wouldn't dare to say that whoever is in control of the bitcoin github account is necessarily on the right side.
 I have to say I am not convinced by any of the two solutions: neither Blocksize increase nor SegWit. And still it seems obvious that both solutions on their own won't solve the issue in the long-long run. I doubt one can increase blocksize indefintely as adoption continues. Just going for SegWit also isn't enough because it will only be a matter of time till you find yourself with the same issue again. From my point of view after reading on both sides, there might just be a hardlimit for adoption and operability of a cryptocurrency atm.

Okay, so what I get from the comments is, nobody basically knows what the right answer is to maintain decentralisation but everybody is united in achieving the same goal but on different tracks. Would that be a fair account?
* r/bitcoin In favor of small blocks. But while small blocks make it easier for a lot of people to participate, it also means doing changes to the protocol. There's concerns that implementations are not thorougly tested enough, could be based on patented stuff and that there's no option to rolling them back on a user voting basis. Also I've heard the claim a lot that it would mean going against what has been proposed by satoshi because the 1MB limit was only implemented as a temporary measure.
* r/btc In favor of big blocks. But while big blocks means smaller changes to the code, there are concerns that it will be harder for a lot of people to participate due to the memory and hardware requirements.
