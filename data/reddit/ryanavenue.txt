You'll get thru it buddy. Being a dad and loving your kids is first. Money makes things easier, but it doesn't come close to family (especially a dad).

Holy fuck, how the fuck does this happen.. This is fucking rediculous, most secure money in the world and you fuck it the fuck up to the tune of $68,000,000...

I agree - he could of went out with honor and dignity but chose otherwise

I kind of agree with this - everyone is discussing how China is putting buyside pressure. From what I've noticed, more buyside pressure is coming from the USA than anywhere else...
The buyside pressure was frantic at times, $1,000,000 a minute lasting days on end. 
I never directly thought the government created Bitcoin, however the buyside pressure I noticed was a source with major cash on hand. I considered possibly it could be the government staking a position in a deflationary currency as a reserve for their central bank to compete against the holdings of China citizens. 
At the very least, I hope our government is smart enough to take an early anonymous position to offset the inflationary fiat printing.

Unequivocally an attack

That's a great point - I may sell if I need fiat cash flow, however I always intend to buyback
@_date: 2016-06-28 00:17:29
FED needs to be buying Bitcoin and stashing it away as a future deflationary  reserve to lend fiat out against

Burn baby burn - I love when Bitcoin is burned

If I own 1 Bitcoin and sell it for USD, I'm effectively short BTC via USD?
If you're looking to make a profit in USD, I suppose you can't short... However I'm only looking to accumulate BTC and not USD, so effectively I'm short BTC by holding USD.

I think if BTC is still around, each coin will be worth so much money, the transaction fees will more than cover the network operation costs. 
I think in the future, the BTC block will be used to securely move large sums of money around the world. Other innovations and sidechains will be used for micro transactions.

Maybe finger print recognition or a private key of some sort that would be recorded for each sale?

I'm all for a DAO social network with inflation or a reserve paying for the maintience costs... Go build a great alt Charles...

We are the most innovative society on Earth with the most powerful military. Money is a function of intellect and we're not going away anytime soon.

Exactly, if this was a life or death situation for a person or a group of people, I'd support the HF.
However, this was poor code which led to a poor speculative investment. People lose money on speculative investments everyday.
Instead of living with this fact, they revert their morals and what they stand for over money, greed, evil... 
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:34:08
Yes,I agree with that. You are correct.

Everyone always complaining about Coinbase - their trading fees are nonexistent if you place a limit order and if you want to short, you just convert to USD with a single sell fee (market order) or zero fee if it's limit.  
Shorting on Coinbase is essentially free by converting to USD. This is a great model for traders unless you're looking to use margin. 
Other exchanges charge astronomical fees making it almost impossible to day trade BTC for a profit. 
I'm almost startIng to think this harassment is from envious competitors. 
I've never had a problem with Coinbase over the last few years and hope this trend continues.

What no one ever talks about is the benefit of large prices increases and being a miner - if Bitcoin hits a huge bubble, miners make bank...
Miners aren't want to turn off now....

Fucking asshats, they belong in prison trying to rob old people of their retirement - these people work hard their entire lives to be able to retire and then you have the slime of society trying to destroy their life...
Sir, I will pray you end up in jail sooner than later you piece of shit...
