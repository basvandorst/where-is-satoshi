Fortunately coinbase now lets you create a multisig vault, which means you have access to your own private keys, so you can be your own bank with them as well.
The benefit is that since you can back up your keys, you're still safe if you lose your passphrase. And if you lose your passphrase, you still have the keys. So there is redundancy.

The number of people who actually go through the trouble of only creating keys on airgapped machines is in the double digits.

Explain what happened exactly. Did you contact support? What was their response? If not, why are you posting here?
Coinbase is known for not locking access to your bitcoin unless you are an outright scammer, only requiring personal info for raising your USD/EUR transaction limits.
It doesn't strike anyone else as funny that these types of vehement criticisms that lack any specific detail whatsoever somehow manage to get upvoted to front page and come out the same time news of them raising money is announced?

Not only are there trolls, but 40% of the population here are from the private companies fighting in this space. They all upvote their own posts in rings and downvote other companies'. is an example. It's poison for this community and there's so much unnecessary battling and criticism that comes from it, and it does end up influencing everyone here in strange ways, forming brand loyalties and awkward dislikes, instead of everyone being supportive of everyone.

Yes that seems likely but I thought they didn't include them previously?

I see, but I thought they launched with it free for cards? Maybe I'm just deluded.
