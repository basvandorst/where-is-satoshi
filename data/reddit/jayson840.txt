Though Bitcoin is not limited by borders of the country, I think South Korea is "friendly" as in its easy to purchase (such as through 7-11). But there are other EU nations such as Germany which accepts Bitcoin as a payment.

Ah ok. Also what I have read (and with my economic knowledge), Ethereum will increase in price but won't be as strong as bitcoin since there may be unlimited supply. However, bitcoins will be strong in the long run due to the limited supply and possibly bigger demand. So should I trade my bitcoin to Ethereum, and then trade back to bitcoin in the future?

I was hoping it would be on small scale rather than using software or having some kind of middleman.

There is a company in S.K that sells bitcoin. The company is called Coinplug. You can either buy it through specialized ATM or through the cash register. Quite cool but still expensive.

I'm new to trading bitcoin right now. Can you tell me how?

If I do participate, do I have to make an original post or can I just put another person's stuff (with credits or/and permission of course)

I guess that 0.01 dollar is a gamble. I can buy more bitcoin through 7-11 thanks to Coinplug but due to continual drop in price of bitcoin and the rise of Ethereum, it makes me wonder if exchanging my money for bitcoin is worth it, and instead exchanging bitcoin for ethereum is a better option.
