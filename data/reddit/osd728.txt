@_date: 2018-09-27 22:41:58
Yes but it will also mean only a 15% tax for long term investors which is much better than the irs property tax on bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-09-08 00:05:47
Oh my god just buy the dip stop �� complaining
@_date: 2018-09-27 22:08:22
yes if it will be classed as a commodity by the IRS instead of a property then the taxes on bitcoin long term will only be 15% which is good for big holders.
@_date: 2018-09-05 23:05:18
Wall Street isn’t going to help crypto the only thing crypto needs is more on ramps for fiat to crypto for more cryptos,then people will figure it out on their own without Wall Street. It just needs to be easier for people to use crypto then fiat or credit card that’s all we need not this Wall Street bull shit. I’d rather buy cryptos and actually own them and use them what good is an ETF for me for someone that uses crypto, nothing.
@_date: 2018-09-25 16:08:53
Good thinking better than half these lame posts I see on reddit bunch of people with no jobs talking about bullshit makes me throw up 
@_date: 2018-09-06 16:17:34
If this is true then a big price boost is incoming 
@_date: 2018-09-27 20:16:56
Definitely a win for crypto 
@_date: 2018-09-26 21:40:58
I would consider using a ledger nano s don’t jump straight into desktop wallets they always crash and you have to have a pretty good tech game to troubleshoot even the most common problems. Cold storage is your best bet. Try it out also you should start researching staking. If you want to be your own bank at least give yourself some interest. That’s what I do 
@_date: 2018-09-19 20:20:57
It’s pretty good you need account verification kyc aml though but still good 
@_date: 2018-09-19 20:20:06
Bitpanda coin mama bitstamp there’s other exchanges Coinbase is just one of many 
@_date: 2018-09-17 18:37:51
Down for now but not out good buying opportunity ahead 
@_date: 2018-09-05 20:12:50
A Goldman Sachs dump is for the lightweights I never cared about wall streets affect on crypto but man it’s nice to buy this dip I don’t care if we bottom again I just want more coins 
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:05:44
If you have no idea then forget it don’t rush if your not sure being your own bank means your responsibility for all your funds good bad or ugly 
@_date: 2018-08-29 23:46:43
What’s wrong with Polly station damn!
@_date: 2018-09-07 20:10:10
Bunch of con artists I feel bad for the people who follow them 
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:57:52
Don’t sell now if you sell now your selling at the bottom at least this dump was quick and it will be over soon it’s not one of those long agonizing dumps like the last one this one is short and sweet pick up more average down I still believe there will be a bull market it August but it’s going to be the last bull run before a catastrophic crash because all of those ETF’s delayed until September will be rejected and bitcoin will hit $700 after and then Ethereum will rise from the ashes and take the  spot and that’s when the real fun starts 
@_date: 2018-09-06 22:27:08
Yes smells like short selling this month is a greedy bad idea I would rather buy and sell till October then just hold we’re going up and down one more time i think or just a steady growth 
@_date: 2018-08-13 22:57:58
Brian Kelley is pretty smart if it’s his way of saying buy then he definitely knows somethings about to blast off 
@_date: 2018-08-06 13:03:31
Huge news!!
@_date: 2018-08-27 02:00:07
Hey bill let me know if you need help storing them stay off the exchanges keep them locally in your own wallet 
@_date: 2018-08-03 17:49:06
I wouldn’t be surprised if we do ATH in August and crash and burn in September and then do ATH again December 
@_date: 2018-08-03 17:05:33
Yes this technology is light years ahead of regulators 
@_date: 2018-08-22 15:03:28
I guess wait until the decision comes out see how the market reacts my prediction is that it’s not going to react as badly as it did the last two times  I think people might be over this etf bs 
@_date: 2018-08-08 13:30:28
Yeah they want sec the biggest insider traders ever to regulate crypto so they feel more safe buying lol 
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:27:05
That’s life man the rich get richer but I don’t use my conscience when I trade I’m just trying to make money if it was up to me I would steel from the rich but it doesn’t work like that I just take it however I get it man 
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:37:43
An actual ETF is completely useless to the crypto community but big sellers(whales) use this kind of fud to crash the market so the can buy back cheaper it’s just part of the cycle even some people  who are bullish are going to cash 
Out before btc dumps and buy back in and get %20 more coins and increase their positions I wouldn’t even trade this dump it’s already happened it’s too late to sell now just hold through this bs we’ll be fine in a week 
@_date: 2018-08-05 13:43:04
This is so cheesy it’s probably why btc dumped in June 
@_date: 2018-08-23 21:32:30
Yeah more pump and dump coming that’s for sure I was gonna just hold till this shit is over but now I’m gonna sell after this pump and buy back in later 
@_date: 2018-08-06 15:23:04
Says someone named meowmix 
@_date: 2018-08-22 21:40:34
Etf today and tomorrow there will be a bitcoin Roth IRA and an even safer way for boring people to feel comfortable investing in bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:21:21
That’s why you keep your real funds in a private wallet and send your spending money to a bullshit wallet only for spending this way you don’t risk your real funds 
@_date: 2018-08-06 16:23:52
Yeah they probably bought the dip 
@_date: 2018-08-05 02:34:31
August spike for etc go etc 
@_date: 2018-08-05 13:38:35
It’s between 10th-16th and a decision will be made 
@_date: 2018-08-27 01:17:22
They were big fish in small pond now there goldfish in an ocean 
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:21:12
It’s most likely anyone who looks at the bitcoin chart for longer than 10 seconds 
@_date: 2018-08-06 01:07:05
Yeah very good devices for storing crypto I say go for it 
@_date: 2018-08-09 22:40:19
It’s all market manipulation tactic Wall Street uses to pump and dump bitcoin all the wall street goons are getting rich off of less fortunate people who think an ETF matters that’s all it is 
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:16:20
Are they going short,selling or,going long all depends 
@_date: 2018-08-06 16:25:24
See they bought the dip now they’ll pump it to 10-11 k 
@_date: 2018-08-02 18:37:22
You got me on the first one lol 
@_date: 2018-08-12 00:50:31
I just though the exact same thing very bullish for the short term we can see a huge spike and a huge dump following 
@_date: 2018-08-12 00:48:22
It’s probably the reason why their doing an ipo to steal money from stock investors for compensating for their loss in crypto 
@_date: 2018-08-06 00:33:21
Why are all these memes penis shaped aliens 
@_date: 2018-08-24 23:43:58
Lamb talk that’s what I’m gonna listen to when crypto makes me a millionaire (lol��������)
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:11:44
It’s not like they’re putting a gun to your head forcing you to identify yourself this is for people who know their signing up for that not for privacy people it’s for people who want that 
@_date: 2018-08-05 02:31:35
All the honeys are gonna flock now 
@_date: 2018-08-05 02:38:23
Soon this week probably whales dump this weekend so they can buy more and increase their position for the coming bull market 
@_date: 2018-08-02 00:22:55
You have to check the availability before you confirm sometimes it says one week and sometimes it says available instantly I never hit confirm unless it says available instantly 
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:22:36
I think this will push btc to 10k and if an etf is miraculously approved we’re going to see an ATH this August just my two cents 
@_date: 2018-08-19 03:01:01
I think we will test 5800 before it happens I’m just being realistic and thinking ahead of a small dip in prices good time to buy though regardless I think we should see 8k again this month 
@_date: 2018-08-05 15:34:20
I mean come on a martial arts super bad ass gangster who deals with crypto lol what else can he do that’s amazing 
@_date: 2018-08-05 02:36:11
I can’t believe the whole market is dumping because of this shit why people buy futures on an exchange that sells bitcoin still amazes me 
@_date: 2018-08-25 19:05:17
Yeah it’s possible pretty much what happened last year 
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:32:19
Yes no one will use two monero wallets and don’t use a payment ID for your real wallet only on your spending wallet 
@_date: 2018-08-31 23:51:12
Oh my god no way I guess this means we’re cool now 
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:19:48
Yeah maybe they just use cash 
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:18:12
It just needs a good on ramp for institutional money so we can take their money and dump when they buy it get it 
@_date: 2019-03-20 01:38:10
Whales, losers, no one really knows too much about it but pretends like they have mastered it.  But besides that it’s good 
@_date: 2019-03-24 03:32:45
Bear markets that bad huh 
@_date: 2019-03-21 12:36:25
They realize that there’s not enough bitcoins to go around forever so they want to make sure they can get there hands on some before it becomes too valued.
@_date: 2019-03-31 21:53:53
It will be very good to have an etf so people can put their 401k into it. I would definitely rather have a bitcoin etf for mine.
@_date: 2019-03-15 11:16:05
Not necessarily a bad thing it also means less short sellers bitcoin doesn’t need Cboe it does nothing for the network it’s irrelevant.

�� everybody shit their pants when they saw that 
@_date: 2018-10-18 10:56:20
If true...yuge 
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:22:00
I think we will dip a little lower before we can go higher plus I’m waiting for 5900 to buy some more I might have a bias opinion but it can happen we fell through 6500 we’re probably going to 6300 if that doesn’t hold I will expect to go below 6k 
@_date: 2018-10-08 19:18:34
Btc on binance it’s traded against tether bitcoin on Coinbase is traded against US dollar 
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:23:43
Yeah it is but they already have banking issues they will take a hit if everyone buys btc at 25x leverage and bitcoin shoots up tomorrow 
@_date: 2018-10-15 21:17:51
Stop he doesn’t make money like that anymore 
@_date: 2019-03-12 18:37:11
These movies are what makes crypto look bad and pathetic this shit won’t even make it to Netflix probably not even YouTube 
@_date: 2018-10-27 00:10:56
i think there gonna go with IBM and Stellar lumens 
@_date: 2018-10-25 12:55:11
Yeah no shit it’s been that way for a long time

@_date: 2018-10-15 13:09:18
Well I don’t really care if you don’t want to hear it it simple math usdt value crashed btc/usdt value went up do you need further explanation 
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:54:07
They don’t want people to take advantage of the low prices and trade bitcoin on leverage 
@_date: 2019-08-10 22:17:38
There are tons of ways
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:26:28
I’m ready for dump short 10x
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:46:25
Yah 78 days later 10k but now dump back to 3
@_date: 2019-02-03 05:22:06
$2800 
@_date: 2019-02-23 23:34:39
I believe it with all the crazy shit happening today in South America all just a chess game between trump and putin so buying bitcoin to do something without anyone knowing makes sense to me 
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:31:13
Lol roof is in time to go back down
@_date: 2019-06-29 22:08:06

You must be doing pretty good of all your worried about is how your going to throw bitcoin on strippers 
@_date: 2019-04-06 00:06:24
I think they are just mad they are not smart enough to understand it 
@_date: 2019-04-17 16:51:34
If anything they can use bitcoins blockchain to track them down now. Which you cannot do with cash.
@_date: 2019-04-14 19:06:43
To hide money from significant other. And another place to store funds other than banks stock market and real estate.
@_date: 2019-04-09 22:00:51
Bull market coming
@_date: 2019-04-06 00:04:56
Right for real she’s probably blowing that old mans saggy balls to keep her job. What’s up with her making bitcoin sound like hookers and cocaine? 
@_date: 2019-04-04 12:35:00
10 k coming soon 
@_date: 2019-04-06 00:08:11

@_date: 2019-04-05 23:23:27
That blonde hoe is a hater 
@_date: 2019-04-05 13:10:24
That’s the spirit. This guy gets it ☝️
@_date: 2019-04-03 11:51:00
I like the last part better 
@_date: 2019-04-11 23:00:31
Feel the same way
@_date: 2018-11-15 01:36:47
Bitcoin will fall eventually but crypto currency will succeed bitcoin is getting old there are much better coins now and much better projects with greater potential

@_date: 2018-11-08 23:40:02
Approx 400k in fines with no additional penalties no cease and desist this is most likely a win for ether delta 
@_date: 2018-11-29 14:13:00
Because people are stupid they don’t know how to 
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:10:48
Yes fortune cookie bitcoin tradings how it all began 
@_date: 2018-11-15 11:56:50
Stop it’s like watching roadkill twitching after a car hit it it would be better if bitcoin ended. It’s too slow it’s not private enough and it’s overly priced. You have to be mad to say it can solve real life problems better than any coin you know that’s not true. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 02:45:23
Yes rock bottom maybe 2800 but I think it’s safe to buy now but I’m no fa just some crazy bastard trying to get rich off bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:25:19
OTC with or without kyc/aml just wondering?
@_date: 2019-01-19 15:48:15

@_date: 2018-11-08 22:47:10
They were only slapped with fines this is good news 
@_date: 2019-01-12 01:19:39
That’s where it all starts from one fortune cookie 
@_date: 2018-11-29 14:05:59
Also they only allow trades that are in multiples of 100 I was forced to use this garbage exchange and they stole 500 xlm from me and it vanished I can’t even find out what my trade fees were 
@_date: 2018-11-15 17:21:51
Hahahahaha this shit is funny �� 
@_date: 2018-07-21 21:20:35
That guys a loser 
@_date: 2018-07-25 13:05:47
It’s actually very good news because now institutional money can flown into the market this is actually the start of solving a custody issue with Wall Street and bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:53:18
Pretty dope
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:01:09
I mean it’s much closer to 0 than 20k why would you sell now if you were gonna sell you would’ve sold already you might as well ride out the storm
@_date: 2018-12-15 22:52:46
Yeah I been buying the shit out of this dip I predict one more to 2800 waiting for that magic number to go all in I believe this massive dump will trigger a massive bull run can’t wait 
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:57:52
Too funny u have too much time on your hands

@_date: 2019-05-31 00:24:59
