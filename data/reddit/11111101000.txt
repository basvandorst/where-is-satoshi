average fees went up because average transaction size did. median fees are unaffected.

except the people who cannot afford $35 transaction fees. there is no room for them.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:56:06


its actually just simple math. fees are per byte so if transactions are bigger you pay more fees. an individual who has been using the same sized transactions is not paying any more fees while the average fee on the network is going up. that is why you should use median for looking at transaction costs.

What i mean by *used* is involved in a transaction, sorry for the confusion. I was just wondering if there was any kind of blockchain analysis software, similar to blockchain.info, that kept track of those stats. It looks like [this guy]( made something that can do this but it is really outdated.

Why would you need to remember that? The guy just typed in $50 and it was automatically converted. It's not like 0.153530 or 153.530 is any better than 153,530 if you are looking to use that kind of precision.

Honestly if you know how and care about turning a 0.0000001% chance of getting bad private keys into 0.00000001%, then just use the github version. Control f should detect changing variables but it isn't worth the trouble if you know how to get the source from github anyway. I am just trying not to scare away beginners incase you are one.
Also, if you are just using brain wallets you should verify that you get the same address from the same input on 2 different computers before you generate any more.

A change like redefining the meaning of 1 bitcoin would have a planned date to go by,  most likely no sooner than a year from now. So unless the software developer is stuck in a mexican prison and the only one able to update the software, i think they will all change it. Bitcoin is still pretty new so personally i think it would go smoothly, but not if this is done 5 years from now.
@_date: 2014-10-21 01:38:40
@_date: 2014-11-03 17:26:26
It would still be the same amount relative to BTC. Not entirely sure what you are saying though.
@_date: 2014-10-21 23:11:01
I don't think it would cause that much confusion. Apple did a 7 to 1 stock split and everything went ok as far as i know. If anything i see it giving bitcoin good publicity for becoming too valuable to be represented in 1/21 million.

It seems like some people want to use the metric system only for the sake of making things more difficult. Like they get a sense of superiority by doing something that many people do not understand. In my opinion a two-decimal system cannot come soon enough. Bitcoin looks really unfinished as-is.
@_date: 2014-10-07 21:43:02
No one is trading in person with gold. It is an issue for bitcoin not only because it confuses people, but because it is awkward to say.

Why would i have both? And what reason would i need to bring it out of cold storage? I am not sure what your point is here. As far as i know they are both equally as easy to take out of cold storage.
@_date: 2014-12-15 00:00:21
The biggest incentive for users is to protect their investment. It's not like the big players would watch the number of nodes drop too far without setting up a few (even hundreds) of them on remote servers.
At the moment many people just run a full node for fun and to support the network. If it is still possible to do this years from now and if the Bitcoin user base grows significantly I can see there being plenty of nodes. This is why gavin andresen proposes we try to keep it possible to run on a somewhat high-end pc with scalability updates.
I think making more generic software which would only serve the purpose of being a node and not a wallet would be nice. It could include some of the things you suggest.
@_date: 2014-11-19 02:33:11
Now if only they would update their mobile app which still forces me to use only BTC.
@_date: 2014-09-24 05:45:12
Every time i see this idea get posted it never gets any attention, not sure why. It seems like a great idea to me to either do this or drop the decimal point entirely (same as switching names with satoshis). I support either ideas as long as the original term is kept.
If anyone has tried to trade something for bitcoin in person they would know how awkward it is to say terms like "millibitcoins". I can't picture my grandma saying that or even any of my friends. One guy tried to say "15% of a bitcoin"... and the problem with bits is it is too similar to "millibits".
Anyway, the best we can do is just raise awareness and hope it becomes a popular idea soon.
@_date: 2015-05-22 19:43:44
I don't know what you expect this to "clear up" unless we can maintain full blocks for multiple days. We have had a &gt; 2 hour block recently and there were no problems because they weren't full for very long after that.
@_date: 2014-09-29 13:28:34
    you get you money back unlike Mt. GOX that set in industry back 1 year IMO.
Does anyone know how this works? If circle gets hacked and it causes the price of bitcoin to crash what happens?
For example if the price is at 1000 and circle loses everything, the price crashes to 600. Do users get back 60% of the value they had stored there and are they reimbursed with fiat or bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-24 22:34:45
The script was most likely written in 2012 or early 2013 according to the wikipedia page. Definitely before the silk road 1 was taken down, when drugs were bitcoin's most popular use. I expect mentions of bitcoin in movies to be more positive a year or two from now.
@_date: 2015-05-04 02:32:14
What is the reason for taking out the increasing max block size for the next 20 years? If we only put this simple rule in now then we will have an even bigger problem once the network starts to get closer to 20MB blocks. Investors will also be less likely to show interest with these future uncertainties.
@_date: 2014-09-29 11:05:51
You're always free to compare the code to the version stored in github. But truth is this is the *moronic* monday thread and the chances of it being hijacked are so slim that i wouldn't recommend it to a beginner. Anyone with that level of paranoia shouldn't even trust usbs that have been used.
@_date: 2014-12-22 21:47:57
How could they manipulate it? And would it make sense to have both a maximum size adjusted automatically and a hard cap (like Gavin's solution) where whatever is lowest at the time is used?
@_date: 2014-11-03 16:52:52


I'll try even though your mind already seems to be made up. First of all to most of the population "bits" means a small amount of something, and they do not know it is a computing term. Most people seem to like it already from what i've seen, just look at the recent mass-tippings on other subreddits.


I think people are a little smarter than that, and if they are not then you probably shouldn't be explaining how cryptographically secure their connection is.
@_date: 2015-05-04 22:12:57
By the time we go to raise the 20MB limit there will likely be more people required to get a consensus with. Also there could be other less clean ways to scale up, avoiding a hard fork. Something that might weaken other parts of the network as a consequence.
I don't know why we wouldn't take advantage of the law of increasing bandwidth. Its future is nowhere near as uncertain as increasing cpu power and storage space. Gavin's original plan seemed so much better to me but I guess we will find out his new one within a week through a blog post.
@_date: 2014-10-21 21:01:14
Does forcing prefixes to be used with every transactions seem the least bit silly to you though? I think it is just inevitable that a simple name is used in place of 100 satoshis. Bitcoin isnt like a precious metal that has a multi-use unit of measurment. These numbers are all arbitrary so may as well make the most used the base unit and give people the option to use the metric system or not. That way everyone is happy.
@_date: 2017-02-22 17:40:25
This is not a concern since it doesn't matter where you download the blockchain from. The only thing that matters is the amount of bandwidth distributing it, not the number of users uploading it. If there is ever a time where it becomes slow for users to download the blockchain it would be easy for bitcoin users who store the whole thing to dedicate more bandwidth to do so.
@_date: 2015-05-08 23:34:23
There can be 2 limits where one is really high and increases with moores law and the other is like 8x the median of last x blocks where lowest of the two is the current max. I don't know if people would like its complexity though. But the slowly increasing limit would be set to the max amount the network should be able to handle and the other one is to prevent unexpected large blocks. The 8x should be at least a few times bigger than the median because every year or so there could be a 2 hour legitimate block or a slow period.
@_date: 2015-05-29 17:03:30

As far as i know it could be individual address rules but i am not sure if anyone knows which ones are satoshi's for sure.
@_date: 2014-10-21 20:42:10
Its one thing to type it and one to say it. Good thing is you can still use k for typing with bits or whatever it ends up being called.

When I first bought into bitcoin I feared that if the price dropped this low I would not have the willpower to hodl. My solution was to destroy the private keys as soon as it dropped under 300 so I would not be able to panic sell if it kept dropping. So far i haven't been able to... yet.
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:45:17
Yes anything is possible as long as you can get a consensus.  A rule where any unspent outputs older than late 2010 would accomplish this but it may have bad consequences. If satoshi actually did have access to his coins he could move them before they get locked but it would reveal the fact that he has access to them, possibly causing a mega-crash.

1,000,000 bits or 1M bits = 247 USD could be  a good way to transition while other exchanges switch over. Eventually they could show 1000 or 1 bits = X USD as default and always give users the option to switch between all 3.

to be fair we don't know how many tokens there will ever be in bitcoin. if the economic majority wants to change any rules, they can. the economic majority 
is incentivized to not harm itself, that is what makes it a good store of value. I prefer bitcoin over ethereum because of its layer 1 simplicity, but not everyone prefers this.

What i want to know is what would a scenario where 2 (countries?) that are at war where one is funding from taxes and the other through inflation would look like. Would the side who is funding from only taxes be at a disadvantage? I'm guessing it depends how much the side who is being taxed does not want to lose the war, and how much they value their freedom.
@_date: 2015-03-27 00:31:35
This was what satoshi planned for it to be after gaining value. I guess he overestimated the community's ability to change stuff, but who knows maybe it will still happen eventually.
