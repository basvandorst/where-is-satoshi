Thanks. And yes I will HODL, I'm not the weak hands type. :D
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:19:22
And I bought during the dip many here called a "correction". :D
12k$ coming tonight too. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:38:41
By new year ? You can add a zero. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:49:29
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:46:33
21 million club ? If even. :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:29:42
When will the sun end ? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:36:57
I'm waiting until sunday to buy more. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:55:35
Taker fees are lower and you don't have maker fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:24:54
I thought it might dip after breaking the $15k wall but nothing yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:14:24
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:55:26
If you hodl it could be $100k by next week. :D
It's already close to $80k now actually. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:32:52
16k$ is coming soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:48:25
Interesting. 90% of the Bitcoin is bought by americans, and europeans don't seem to be interested at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:58:25
Alts which will probably make you more money down the road, though I'm not sure that's what you want given your post. :D
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:45:51
And could the man prey tell us by what is the dollar backed since 1971 ?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:06:23
Could you look at your dashboard ? Is it stuck to 4 pm PST/7 PM EST/ 1 am DST at the bottom right ? Because mine has been stuck with the same prices for over an hour, and if yours has suffered a similar fate that might explain why it didn't work. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:56:54
Why is your friend selling $5k below the market price ?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:08:30


It's up 3% compared to 24h ago...
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:34:25
We didn't even have time for the 13k memes. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:40:59
Its growth yesterday wasn't normal or sustainable. It's a short-term correction, but in the long run the growth will still be there I think. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:37:36
There's a little dip. Buy now. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:53:31
You've raised him well. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:54:51
Ok, thanks. Just wanted to make sure I wouldn't have the authorities knocking at my door for that. I'll have to look at the fees and how much is required for it to be worth it. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:16:49
Front. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:52:25
I do think he has a point when he says that an asset with such a huge volatility will be difficult to use as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:57:04
A meme around "hold" which originated here :
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:10:13
You're not far from the future then. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:14:23
I do hodl in the long-run, but I also want to make some cash with the fluctuations. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:10:56
It is on Gdax. In fact it's almost at 15k€ now. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:06:56
Good. Hopefully they actually get into it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:25:48
The more money you have, the more money you can make. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:14:03
Ditto. I think the US price will follow the trend when americans wake up. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:20:25
You don't sell, you eventually use to buy if you really need something. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:48:49
Could two people, one living in the eurozone and one in America, not do this together ? Some kind of arbitrage set up. Or would it be illegal ? 
The person living in the US buys the BTC, he sends them to the person living in the eurozone who trades them for euros. That person then sends those euros back to the person living in the US but in dollars and the person living in the US buys more BTC with those dollars. And so on and so forth.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:02:52
Some gains to be made by selling at the peak then buying at the dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:34:35
If $15k follows 10k, we'll have a short dip afterwards because of all the weak hands. I'd wait and see the reaction following $15k if I were you.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:13:15
It's worth the price people are willing to pay. Simple really. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:16:40
They don't have to. If they buy 2 million satoshi for $300, it's the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:45:05
Don't buy and hold. Buy and HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:11:44
I'm seeing more and more people buying bitcoin just hoping to make some quick cash out of it. They obviously don't understand the point : HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:08:22
I thought about selling to make some cash in case of a dip. Glad I didn't. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:51:05
If it does, it's going to be very ugly. You better either hodl and be convinced or have a stop-loss order ready. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:15:34
Second option. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:08:43
No limit. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:19:55
Nobody knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:01:15
On Gdax BTC is at over 14k€ which at current exchange rates is about $16.5k. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:48:31
Sell high, buy low. Buy more to lower the average and so you don't need to sell at more than 17.5k to make a profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:52:45
Well deserved indeed. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:45:56
It's a bubble, but one that won't explode for various reasons. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:22:13
He said $15.5k and 14.7k€ though. In dollars that's over $17k at current exchange rates, so you could actually make over $1.5k per bitcoin at current prices.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:13:17
I know, but mining for weeks for that doesn't seem very profitable. 
You should give out some satoshis for each ticket just so people don't feel like they're doing it all for nothing. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:55:24
They already planned quite far ahead with 8 digits but really they could just add extra digits if the value of one bitcoin increases to the point where it becomes necessary. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:42:53


Lower supply =&gt; Higher value.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:46:09
Perfect. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:33:08
Outlawed because people might realise official currencies aren't worth the paper they're printed on ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:43:26
That's not a correction. A high-volatility asset like bitcoin is never going to only increase linearly without experiencing a few drops here and there. It dropped 1k from its high but it's still up over 8% from yesterday. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:05:47
The current jackpot is kind of crap though. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:44:10
More like so you can't buy during the drop before the next huge increase. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:02:03
Don't worry, it will happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:50:14
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:58:44
With Coinbase, it's news when you can actually buy or sell without any issue. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:06:10


Holy shit. So you were basically a billionaire for a few hours today. Any proof ? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:22:36
That just means it's time to buy, or soon will be. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:12
What goes up must always come down. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:59:06
Not just you. I have the same issue.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:30:26
Not always, and generally with more effort required. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:02:40
He hedl but the Russians were there again. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:34:03
No because I want to buy more.
