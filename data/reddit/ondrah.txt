Sorry. I'm not against bitcoin, but seriously? 
Step 1) go to *closest* theatre, buy ticket with cash. 
Step 2) there is no step 2

Well in your case you would just by by debit card at the theatre wouldn't you?

Actually a lot of countries have a ID requirement when selling sim cards. Many european ones (France and Switzerland definately, not sure about others), one of the strictest is Japan, where you need a residence permit in order to buy a sim card. Little bit crazy...

Actually as an American abroad you can’t open an account due to US tax law and the burden it places on banks working with Americans. So also an issue of regulatory over reaching, buynot AML.

My god what is this. reading headlines from zerohedge for 30mins??
Will there be a follow up video on Monday night explaining why nothing happened at the emergency end of the world bitcoin meeting?

I'm sorry, are you implying that bitcoin will rise to destroy the government and anarchy will rule the world?
Besides, bitcoin regulation is easy and will arrive if required. The only way for btc to rise is for it to become mainstream, for fortune 500 companies to accept them. If the government forbids amazon from accepting btc, it will never become a major currency. If banks do not deal with btc, it will never become a major currency.

Man, so it turns out btc is really unsecure? i.e. less secure than my online banking? And in addition securing it seems like a major pain in the ass. One of the main benefits was supposed to be ease of use - this pretty much kills that for me. Guess i'll be postponing dopting..

Agreed, however the more it gets used for illicit activities, the more interest it will attract from governments. If it is used 80% for illegal activities and 20% by you and me, do you think it will survive government regulation?
