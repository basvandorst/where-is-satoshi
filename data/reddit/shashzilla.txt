The fees to withdraw from Bitstamp for fiat are quite low, so in theory you're better off going to a reputable local dealer for Gold where you can shop for the best price.
The convenience factors is pretty awesome, though.
I don't seem to see the "Gold" options listed anymore, however. Odd.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:18:54
Lol - tons of places to go for selling Gold. That's a silly remark.

If you need any volunteers to help you with your donating workload (research, sorting/filtering, handling communications, etc...), I'm happy to be of service.
This is a serious response. I'll reach out directly as well.
I volunteered 4 years of my youth to a non-profit organization that has effectively helped to jumpstart a revolution in education, but as soon as they turned into a for-profit company, I left for a sales position at a reputable company. That was several years ago.
I would love to help by leveraging my experience and joining your cause to move the kindness needle forward.

I'd be happy to help in this endeavor. This is definitely a growing epidemic.
We would need to identify sites which have the greatest needs first, or perhaps base this off a location where there is the most interest from workers/volunteers.

I'd like to suggest a [Dr. Arthur Tomie from Rutgers University]( in New Brunswick, NJ as a recipient for your donation.
Specifically, his efforts on alcohol &amp; drug addiction prevention &amp; towards providing an alternative to the D.A.R.E program in the U.S. 
He's accomplishing this by developing his research on sign-tracking and transforming it into an interactive presentation that he can share at educational institutions across the nation. Although sign-tracking research is fairly nascent, Dr. Tomi's work is highly regarded in the field and his approach to drug&amp;alcohol addictions is a much more holistic approach. It's designed to help those who are afflicted, rather than the "Just say no" approach.
He's currently published books and has speaking tours in which he's helped address the rising addiction issues in Native American communities.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:51:48
Spot on. His gains could actually purchase him a Lambo.

There are environmental challenges with panels, but this can be improved upon in future architectures. It’s certainly an improvement already upon oil.

In that light, imagine a future where solar energy defines the dollar's value:
Instead of using petroleum, we have created an ecosphere that supported and thrived on solar-harvested energy, and that cemented the future value of the dollar as we're the main leaders in that space. If that wasn't the greatest incentive and motivator for United States to lead the charge in solar energy reformation (and subsequently improving the environment), I don't know what is.

Coinbase is great for a lot of people, but there are many who still find it difficult or intimidating. I'm wanting to reduce that barrier to investing and let these people take part in this opportunity with the rest of us.
Perhaps the concept is not possible as I've laid out, but it is possible. There are so many people that are missing out on this phenomenal opportunity to invest in cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin is just the tip of the iceberg, albeit a very large tip. I want to help others find an easier way to jump into this, and although Generosity.com was a good starting point, I see that more is needed. I hope to build off the interest being piqued and continue to address some of the issues at hand, including infrastructure. Thanks for your input mate.

Good point - editing now to reflect one weekly buy. As volume increases, I would look into daily or twice daily purchases - but as of now, once weekly keeps overhead at a minimum.

Update to the BBE Project:
- Deadline established to minimize the effect of fluctuations in BTC marketplace. This campaign will end on October 2nd, 2017 at 10:00AM EST, and a new one will begin thereafter. (Planning to keep this weekly until daily is feasible)
- Our service fee has been re-examined and reduced to 2% of all donation amounts. We will be using this towards our educational initiatives as well.
- We have selected Bitstamp as our preferred exchange host due to their stability (Ripple association) and reduced fee cost at larger volume levels. Although we will be including educational information about Coinbase as well, Bitstamp will be used for currency conversions.
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:54:54
Haha I was just as excited when I first acquired my first few BTCs - what an amazing potential!
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:00:57
It's really exciting seeing Bitcoin become more accepted within the US political cycle, though!
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:39:40
Am I correct in reading this as 59,687,956 USD in demand (orders placed, "bids") &amp; 3,178 BTC in supply (bitcoins offered, "asks")?
There's over $59M in demand but less than $1.3M in supply. I understand looking at the overall demand is misleading, but I would think there's a stronger correlation (and subsequently boost in price). 
Would love for someone that knows more about trading to offer some basics and information about where I can keep learning about how these trends impact the day trades.
@_date: 2017-09-26 21:54:40
My intentions are sincere. Any suggestions on ways that I could provide greater assurance?
I estimate the service fees will be 5-6% on the initial run, as there were greater costs upfront, and the fee dropping thereafter as a natural result of scaling this idea out. As for the transaction fees, there won't be any from Generosity and I'll be shopping for the best USD -&gt; BTC.
I truly understand your concerns as for assurance, but I've not yet come across a good solution to this. Please feel welcome to share ideas! I just re-edited the campaign to include my LinkedIn profile so that there is culpability and people can see the face behind the profile.
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:17:02
Reading the logarithmic scale isn't as easy as I imagined. Googling for resources to help... but would you have any suggestions on best place to start?
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:22:02
lmao the last line XD
@_date: 2017-10-09 01:05:49
The entire site would operate solely with BTC payments.

*"Hey fellas, these tests aren't 100%..."*
"...Oh, really? Hrm, let's discriminately use this information against one group of citizens to categorically deny them the ability to be a part of the blood volunteering community. I think that makes the most sense"
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:28:25
You may not realize this, but HIV isn't the only virus that's tested for when people donate blood.
Here's the FDA's list:
Hepatitis B and C viruses; Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Types 1 and 2; Human T-Lymphotropic Virus, Types I and II; Treponema pallidum  (Syphilis); West Nile Virus; Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease)
There are 5 layers of safeguards in place to protect against all of these viruses. Yet, you seem to be most concerned with HIV and find it reasonable to categorically deny a group of people the chance to even be screened.
Like the earlier commenter posted, "your politics &amp; phobias are showing."
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:22:51
What are you still going on about?
Can you please, if you actually care about this topic, read that second link I posted?
There are layers of safeguards in place, thus negating **ALL** of the concerns you've shared. Now, this truly is a judgement thing. You're sharing your opinion.

"The tech investor noted that when Silicon Valley tech stocks crashed after a rapid rise in value in the late 1990's, no one questioned the internet as an essential future platform."
Most important quote from the article.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:18:02
Safeguards in place which nullify your "argument".
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:13:38
Don't be rude and reduce this to name-calling. Defend your argument and don't attack me personally, as that's just immature.
You are implying that because the tests are not 100% accurate, homosexuals should categorically be excluded from being allowed to donate -- and you call this scientific.
That's not scientific, that's your opinion.
The "screening questions" you referenced still exist for all blood donators, regardless of their sexual preference. And thus, they're still being effectively screened.
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:14:59
Do you still stand behind your analysis?
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:32:03
A platform like Upwork would be quite suitable for offering BTC payment.
@_date: 2018-07-14 13:53:08
Not likely due to the reality of a constrained supply’s exponential impact on price.
