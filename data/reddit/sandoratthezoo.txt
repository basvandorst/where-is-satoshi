The majority hash power "wins" no matter what. If they want to move to new rules and nobody follows them then there's nothing stopping them from continually attacking the network still following the old rules rendering it useless. The only defense is to change the PoW. Either using a new trapdoor function or doing away with PoW entirely. If the former then whoever has the most computing power to compute the new function is in control and bitcoin's security is considerably weaker.
You can talk about economically dependent nodes all you like but they were never mentioned in the system's design and there is no direct mechanism for them to make protocol decisions. They can only potentially indirectly influence miners, which kinda seems like it's largely the point of this blog post.

So is the implication then that bitcoin has less than 5,500 users?

Disagree. The vast majority of users must be using SPV nodes or entirely hosted nodes. Surely there aren't just 5,500 users.

Sure, running a full node defends against some types of attacks but ultimately if &gt;50% of the hash power is determined to attack the network it isn't going to help you.
Even with an SPV wallet you can cross-check your transactions with multiple nodes and have a reasonable level of assurance you aren't being robbed. That's probably what most people do. They buy some coins from somewhere like Coinbase and then maybe they transfer them to Mycelium on their phone. Then they probably look at blockcypher.com or blocktrail.com or Insight to double-check the transaction. In this scenario multiple (3-5) organizations would have to be colluding against the SPV user for them to be successfully attacked. It's clearly an acceptable level of risk to them.

I don't think you understand how a &gt;50% attack works. The attackers can unwind history from the point at which they started the attack. They can reverse an arbitrarily long chain of transaction confirmations for as long as they continue to control a majority of the hash power. Even full nodes would have no protection.

Hmm. I wonder why Satoshi never mentioned this security assumption you're making. Not that it's necessarily wrong.
