The word "myth" is right there in the phrase, the myth of the rational consumer.
Capitalism is not an answer, people spend money as intelligently as they do anything. Not to mention, there is no corollary between money and intelligence; some of the dumbest people in history controlled a lot of money.

Our laws are shifted to spread wealth to the wealthy.
Lower taxes on capital gains and carried interest than wages.
Gains can be untaxed if reinvested, essentially an owner of a large portfolio can save taxes by buying into a larger portfolio.
Cuts in the estate tax.
Presently, you can gift someone $5,000,000 tax-free in a lifetime, not including the $14,000 you can gift tax-free per year on top of that.
Working people don't believe in unions anymore. But, rich people still believe in lawyers and managers who are trying to lowball employee wages.
Businesses (and by extension shareholders) receive tax incentives.
Many mining, drilling, or extraction businesses make money from public lands. Offshore drilling is public land. That land belongs to the people of the US. The resource rights belong to the people of the US. Companies have to pay us to use those lands... thanks to lobbying, the US is paid some of the lowest royalties in the world for public land exploitation. Profitable companies get a discount to use public land. 
Most agriculture is handled by large companies. Agriculture is subsidized by our tax dollars. Our tax dollars are used to help profit-seeking companies.
If capitalism makes a mistake that can't be fixed, what then? Look up how much arable soil is lost to housing and commercial development. With drought in California and miles of suburbs, where are we going to grow almonds?
And on and...

People put their money behind a lot of stupid shit... and they don't learn from their mistakes.

What do people do with their money?
A fool and his money are soon parted.
