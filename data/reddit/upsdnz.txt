You have your answer already.   
But 'what if' bitcoin becomes practically worthless, and 21mil bitcoin  can't buy a coffee. What then? , you can't make/mine more bitcoin.

If you want to make a career in crypto you will need the ability to learn fast and absorb much information.  
 Everything you ask can be found already many times over and you should have found already.

I don't see this hapening ( EU perspective). What I do see hapening is actions to make sure 'they' get their **cut**. Which prob. will involve the on- off ramps to/from crypto.

They are very cheap to generate. But generating a paperwallet printout safely is cumbersome.  I use paperwallets but when hardware wallets start supporting monero I'll switchover.    
P.s. a (paper)wallet can also be made of metal. i use punchletters on an aluminum sheet. Bit more water/fireproof.

From what I read is that the ROI is negative for small private miners mining Bitcoin. Many go to altcoins. You likely spend your money better by just buying a few bitcoin and let it grow.

I think many people are hoping for an (early) retirment. I also think most investors do have some extra money, and feel overall comfortable with the risk of crypto. This is good, it will ' lock up' a lot of crypto for many years and add to the scarcity.

Just change bank, make sure to make your reasons public . And choose modern bank.  
Did it a while ago, also after bank refused transfer to a bitcoin related company. Phoned them, asked them why, told them it is my money and cancelled account. Simple.
