People saying this will be the first to sell when btc hits 10k.

So you made good returns, good for you.  You've madr money on those who lost money, and now you want people to buy to make money off of people who come later than you. Know what it sounds like?

Only the poor fear the banks. Not an insult mind you, just an observation.

When people like you enter the game, it's already over. THEY profited off of your poor sorry ass, can't you see? Now it's only you suckers bagholders in the race. Better just start another generic MLM, you'll have better chance that way.

 Are there enough fools in the world to hold your bag, you mean? Well there are enough fools to pump this ponzi to 20k, but I think we're running short of them.

And that limit of 21 million Bitcoin will be its downfall. Wealth can be created, while Bitcoin cannot be.

You have to ask first, why did it moon like it did?

Holding a heavy bag in hope that some other sucker will take it off your bent shoulder in 20 years, all the while denying the reality in front of you? Sign me the fuck up.

A fool and his money, etc.
