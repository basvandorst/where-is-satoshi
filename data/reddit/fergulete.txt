So far I've found 6 addresses within the puzzle, none of them had any BTC in them tho xD

I've recovered over 80 so far. If you're using electrum or mycelium you don't need an email account for each wallet.

Thanks for the idea, we'll be adding stuff like this asap. 
There's tons of things to do and all this feedback you guys are giving us is priceless!

We went the $49.99 route to test the waters mostly. I'm still baffled by the amount of telegram groups going around charging from 0.1 to 0.5 BTC to join and there's a lot of mixed results on those.
We're adding Coinbase Commerce support in the next couple of weeks, so that might smooth things out a bit.
Thanks for the feedback bro, appreciate it!

Me? I'm just a walking meme. But my brother, he studied engineering back in Argentina- a crazy country, I'll tell you about it some day- and they drilled him on math, mathematical optimization and statistics.
In our previous startup, we created data scrapers and analysis models to help exporters from any country find the best countries and cities to sell their products in. We matched people to specific buyers withing each market, basing our match % on historical purchase data, company growth and a bunch of other markers.
We're into data cause it moves the world and it certainly moves all cryptos.

We'll definitely do this. Would you have any preference between having that free weekly/daily prediction on the site or checking it on social media?
Right now we're doing 2 predictions a day because we're doing a little human-made analysis to go with it, so users get to know why we think the price is going to swing a certain way. Once we get to speed this up, we'll increase the frequency.

Idk what people's ROI will be, it depends on many factors, but the price estimate we give on the website accurately predicts where the price will sit at ~80% of the time. 
Like you said, the biggest issue are massive dumps and we're working on fixing that via block explorers. I don't know how well it will work but that's our approach xD
What we do here is mostly say "ok, it's 2pm and bitcoin sits at $X, at 6pm it should be at $Y" and this is right around 80% of the time.

We've been using this for a while, we made a trading bot that does trading and takes care of everything for us. 
The problem is, we don't have the capital to really make it big. 
So we're "sharing" the prediction tool with the public and investing all the proceeds into the trading bot. Making millions is easier when you start with a few thousands in investing capital!

Hi guys,
 
My brother and I have been working on a tool to help us predict Bitcoin price movements for a couple of months and we posted it to Product Hunt today. I'm super excited about it and really want to know what people think of it. Apologies in advance if this wasn't the right place to post it.
 
Most people trying to predict prices are doing technical analysis by hand (measuring candles, checking resistance lines, applying fibonacci, etc.) and some of them are getting decent results. Wall Street does TA with bots for their algorithmic trading, which is faster and more reliable, so we made our own TA bot.
 
We combined our TA bot with a machine learning algorithm to understand how the news and other IRL events such as financial markets affect the price of bitcoin. So far we've been doing great.
 
The tool has been around 80% accurate on the couple of months we've been developing it so it's been fun to say the least haha.
 
If anyone wants to check it out or just have a conversation about what we've made, price prediction or trading, HMU or check us out at 
Or check our Product Hunt

Hey man, how's it been? You've been in the bathroom for like an hour now, are you ok?
@_date: 2018-03-22 20:54:25
We haven't set up any auto responders, I'm sending confirmation emails by hand as I see people sign up. Startup culture xD
@_date: 2018-03-22 21:47:45
We've been improving them all the way from 57%. It started with just teaching our machine learning algorithm how to do technical analysis, changing or adding techniques to improve the accuracy of each prediction against past outcomes. 
At this point we started running our predictions against real time outcomes and improving until TA got us close to 65% accuracy.
Then we started adding markers from everywhere we could think of. We have data feeds from every stock exchange and financial market in the world, from every news outlet we could find, every bitcoin related website, twitter. 
We added each marker and measured how it affected the accuracy of each prediction, tweaking things around. We'd improve by 0.5% to 1% every day, nowadays it's way harder to make improvements, but we're still tweaking as much as we can.
I think at this point we're consuming more computing power on AWS than if were just running a mining operation. 
Today we're hitting around 80% accuracy (sometimes a little under, sometimes a little over) and it's been good. We cover our expenses but like I said in another reply, we don't have the capital to turn this into a large scale trading rig yet, the money we have for trading is compounding nicely, but we're not close to "millions" yet xD

We're actually doing a giveaway on Product Hunt right now, 5 people get free accounts for one month. 
I can't link directly to the referral code we're using for PH, but you can click on our website's address from PH

wasa wasa wasa wasa!
Oh wait
But for real tho, I'd love to know if you'd be interested in this after we get a proven track record. I'm gonna start posting some predictions on twitter.

I can hand you a vial and a snake, but PETA's specifically banned me from extracting the oil myself!

If the price is moving too quick making it impossible to avoid a fee, the bot will bite the bullet and pay the market fee. It's a lower % cut on each trade, but we still come out on the green. 
We've made a few hundreds of thousands of dollars for GDAX like this =(
P.S. we're not selling access to the bot, just to the data it uses
@_date: 2018-03-22 19:25:01
Why tho? Mind elaborating a bit?

We just need sad Keanu sitting next to him and this will officially be the saddest pic ever )=
