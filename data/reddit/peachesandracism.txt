Just happened upon this and I would like to say 
For your sake I really hope you bought in 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:46:39
I hope he/she/attack helicopter takes this seriously, I’d do the same thing 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:34:17
Cool 
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:11:31
Of course 
Electrum is by far the best soft wallet

Man I wish I was into bitcoin 2 years ago. I’m a little late to the party compared to you, started end of 2016.
Yeah as more people buy, the value of one bitcoin increases so if you bought one bitcoin at 4800$ a couple months ago and held onto it you’d now have an asset worth at this very moment 7300$. That’s a 2500$ gain off a 4800$ investment in a matter of a few months. 
Once it goes mainstream one bitcoin will easily be worth &gt;20k at least that’s my prediction as of now. I’m expecting 10k by march. 
However it is a currency and i’m talking about it like it’s a stock or bond but you get the idea

I see he said use coinbase. Do not use Coinbase! Coinbase is awful, try CEX, gemini, or kraken. 
Also if you’re not planning on trading I’d suggest a trezor for your wallet! 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:22:53
Should I be concerned about this? 
Also it seems coinbase wants this to happen but i’ve heard coinbase is shit so I’m confused on that as well. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:01:00
Trezor 
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:29:18
Yeah! 
If you want a step by step process just go to the subreddits wiki and __all__ of the info you need is there! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:57:37
This needs to be at the top

Sorry my dude, context matters a lot. 
Okay so say there is something going on, you could also use that reasoning to apply to basically anything. You could say there are forces acting in the background of everything in our everyday lives and you might be right. 
As of now bitcoin is growing, a decentralized currency is the future. Now if you’re a little hesitant to buy still then wait until the hardfork which should be around the 16th of this month.
I will be honest my opinion is a bit bias because it is something I believe in, however bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general has not really gone mainstream yet, however once once it does it’s going to be huge.

Litecoin and Ethereum are both good bets as well! 
I even bought a little Z-coin because I like the creators and privacy 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:01:33
Well it just did so I guess we’ll find out 
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:20:27
Oh shit really? I’m sorry to hear that. 
If they have social media try reaching out there, that seems to work for his kind of things 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:08:58
How? The entire point is to get more people on board, don’t be a wannabe hipster who thinks they’re cool because they use cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:09:35
Thank you!

Their customer service is non existent, is my biggest complaint. 
Just look in the sub’s wiki there are multiple others that are much better 
If you want examples just google “issues with coinbase reddit” and their will be multiple examples
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:48:59
thank you! 
I sent an email to CEX today
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:28:11
Electrum. 
I have some on CEX for trading purposes. 
I was thinking of purchasing a trezor in the next week.
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:12:25
Okay, not sudden. Relatively rapid increase over a week. From 3700 to almost 4400
