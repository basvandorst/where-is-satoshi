I don't get how people such as John Williams can be so short-sighted. 


Surely it should be obvious that it's going to be hugely volatile until we reach a point where it represents net global value. 
***It's at this point*** that it would then become less volatile than even the current global reserve currency, the USD. And in turn it will then become the standard, stable, global currency.

1. Do a little research about how to generate a secure paper wallet on an 'air gap' laptop.
2. Put details of paper wallet in a text file.
3. Encrypt the text file and note the passphrase.
4. Store multiple copies of the encrypted file, online, in email, USB sticks etc.
5. Buy coins on an exchange and transfer to the paper wallet.
6. Make damned sure you never lose that passphrase! Engrave it in metal in more than one geolocation.
7. Simply sit back and wait

And balance this advice with understanding that money is not the source of all happiness in life.
In other words, try not to fuck this up but don't agonise over it if you do.

Well by the same line of thinking you could say that the dotcom boom ruined my life because I didn't buy Amazon.com when it cost $5. Or that beanie babies ruined my life because I didn't stockpile all the rare ones when they were $1 each. Or that Saudi Arabia ruined my life because I didn't go over there, convert to Islam and marry a local lady who owned a piece of land that sat on an oilfield before it was discovered. 
Point is, we all constantly make decisions based on the best information that's available at the time. You made the best decision you could, move on.
Let's see what your next decision brings you :-)
P.s. you're imaginging that if you had got rich your life would be perfect, but could be that you would have developed a major paranoia complex, distrusted your friends, abandoned your family and ended up shut up in some empty luxury apartment, soulless and with no purpose in life. Perhaps this is the best thing that ever happened to you.

I don't understand this logic. I've seen it posted several times now. If all 15.5 million people bought a Bitcoin and just held on to them as tightly as they could then surely it would become worthless? If nothing ever moves around then liquidity drops to zero. If you never do anything with the Bitcoin, never spend it, then what's the point? Why would anyone, apart from a few extreme nerds, ever want to hold a random number in a ledger if it's never used in the real world?
In my view I'm glad there are a lot of people out there actually taking a hit for the team and using their bitcoin to buy goods and services. That's doing the greatest service to the movement in my opinion, not holding.

Maybe it's because you're not spending it so you don't really appreciate what it represents?
How about trying to lubricate the infrastructure by spending the Bitcoin in worthwhile self-reinforcing projects?

Sounds like a much more sustainable plan if you ask me. I think NEO has the same idea (and why they said they chose their logo colour to be 'green').

Ah, gotcha. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-01-16 08:33:12
I see, so when you said you wanted 15.5 million people to buy and hold 1 Bitcoin your sentiment was that you want most people to buy and hold and just a few bitcoins to be available for day to day business? I read that as you wanted people to buy and hold all of the bitcoins in existence, which would grind things to a halt. Two ways to look at that sentence :-)

If you have an older, crypto-dedicated air-gapped machine that you've formatted properly yourself then the chances of it being tampered with are so low they're just seriously not even worth worrying about. 
There are tons of people who have clients just sitting on their damn online desktops with unencrypted private keys and they haven't been compromised. 
Your biggest worry should be with how you store your private key and the weakest link will probably be you forgetting where you put it, storing it on a single point of failure hard drive or forgetting your password that you used to encrypt it as humans are prone to do. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:46:00
No, but I do judge a fish on its potential impact on the global climate. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:57:52
No. But Bitcoin is a chance to reduce the energy consumption and it has almost arbitrarily been designed not to.

This is very subjective. It all depends how much the money means to the father compared to wanting to support his son who appears to be very passionate about something. 
Perhaps he's fine with spending $10k to help his son learn a life lesson. I wouldn't consider my son to be a fool if he lost money on his first investment at age 17. And if it pays off then, heck, they can both enjoy the success together. 
The truth is that Bitcoin investment could be very time critical and if he waits for a few years (or however long it would take a 17 year old to save up $10k) then it may be too late. I was gutted I missed the dotcom boom because I was just a teenager still doing a paper round.
I say carpe diem - the only live once and it's only money. Just make sure your father isn't relying on this $10k to pay for your mother's hospital bills or whatever.

Are there any stats on this? Would be interested to see.

Yeah I think I will end up going the BIP38 route. 
Although I would like a physical paper copy too probably. 
And thanks for the reminder about doing everything offline. I have a couple of reasonably secure paper wallets but there's always the chance that I slipped up somewhere along the line. I'd like to take some proper precautions and generate some new wallets as far removed from online as I possibly can and transfer to these.
Will follow that github link, cheers.

Hey great, thanks for this - will take a look :-)
@_date: 2016-12-02 19:21:50
That's the way I saw it too but was thinking I must be missing something.
I'm envisaging not needing to access my wallet very frequently so I like the idea of just BIP38 encrypting it. And then possibly even using something like cryptosteel to record my passphrase as there won't be any obvious link about what that passpharse actually relates to even if it did get stolen. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:53:38

So... are paper wallets from bitaddress.org still safe if the html is used on an airgap computer? 
The code to generate truly unique/random public/private keys isn't flawed is it?
@_date: 2016-12-02 18:56:52
Oh those cryptosteels look cool! Maybe I'll get a couple of those. Thanks!
@_date: 2016-12-02 20:27:36
Hey thanks for the confirmation that paper wallets are the way to go. I think I like the idea of keeping an offline copy and an online encrypted copy. 
But I might not keep my offline copy in plain text format, perhaps more of a clue as to how to get into the encrypted online copy. 
In fact I'm thinking that I might get one or two of these cryptosteel devices mentioned elsewhere in this thread to make sure my offline copy survives fire etc. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 09:33:21
My current email password is 23 characters and I've remembered that for over 10 years now so I'm pretty confident I can also remember a password for the encryption although I'd probably leave a written copy somewhere too, perhaps with relatives. 
Got to say I don't really understand this HD wallet seed stuff. But will have a read into it. Cheers!
@_date: 2016-12-02 09:24:33
Hey, thanks for that - I'm a little too lazy to look into it in depth tonight but just wondered, aren't I then relying on not losing this piece of hardware? Or what happens if it breaks down?
@_date: 2016-12-02 09:38:40
Ah ok, so is the idea that this makes online theft harder because they need access to the physical device + the seed words?
Guess would need to work out how to store the seed words securely too though?

The confusion here is you're not really employing them on a BTC contract, you're just paying whatever number of BTC is equivalent to their wage in USD.

Crunch time for bitcoin as it faces last chance to go mainstream
Bitcoin is at a crossroads. One route will make it as easy to use as a debit card, the other ends in obscurity. Can its users agree on its future?
Time to ring the changes
Reuters/David Gray
By Timothy Revell
FOR the better part of a decade, bitcoin has been touted as the currency of the future, but for most people it has remained just that – a future not current currency. Technical problems have stymied its mainstream adoption.
But now, an elegant fix to one of bitcoin’s most intractable problems could clear the way, potentially making bitcoin as easy to use as the debit card in your wallet today.
If, that is, bitcoin’s decentralised network of users agree that this is a good idea. The community is at war with itself: some want it to remain a niche currency, used only for sending money across borders or for purchasing items on the dark web. “There are some very outspoken people in bitcoin’s core development team that are stopping progress – it’s crazy,” says Olivier Janssens, a bitcoin investor.
So why are we at this crossroads, and will it lead to a bitcoin we use to pay rent and buy coffee – or will it seal the cryptocurrency in permanent obscurity?
When bitcoin was introduced in 2008, it promised to become something you could use to buy whatever you wanted, without the need for banks (see “What’s so great about bitcoin?“).
Nearly 10 years later, bitcoin is the world’s largest digital currency. Its value and number of users have risen (see graph), as has the average number of transactions.
But recently, the currency has become a little stuck. In its earliest days, bitcoin transactions were free and would take about 10 minutes to process. Now, people are paying more than $1 per transaction on average to the miners who both create bitcoin and process transactions on the network, and can wait hours or days for transactions to be confirmed.
This delay is down to the rise in users. The bitcoin network can support at most seven transactions per second. Compare that with Paypal, which can do 100 per second on average – or Visa, which routinely does about 4000, and could do much more if pressed.
If bitcoin is to compete, it needs to lower fees and be faster. Few would pay $1 to use bitcoins to buy their morning cup of coffee, and that number would drop to none if you had to wait a day for the payment to clear.
Bitcoin has long been in need of an upgrade, but deciding the best way to do that is difficult. By definition, the bitcoin network is under no centralised control. So any decision to make big changes requires a consensus among its users. And at the moment, that seems a long way off.
The controversy is over whether to change the software that is now struggling to cope with bitcoin’s increasing popularity. It all comes down to a simple line of code in the bitcoin network software that sets the maximum block size – representing the number of transactions allowed over roughly 10 minutes – to 1 megabyte. Throw any more transactions at the network than that, and they have to either wait or pay a higher fee to get bumped up the queue.
There seems to be an obvious solution: why not just lift the 1-megabyte limit? In 2015, a group of developers led by Mike Hearn, who had left his job at Google to become a bitcoin developer, tried to do just that. Hearn created a new version of the software running the bitcoin network that changed the limit to 8 megabytes.
The update sparked a furore. One problem was that the new software wasn’t backwards-compatible, so once activated, anyone running the old system would essentially be kicked off the network.
There were more fundamental objections too. Many worried that if the blocksize increased, users would need more computing power and faster internet speeds to be part of the network. Some people feared that this could lead to greater centralisation because only the most powerful mining groups could remain active.
Price crash
By 2016, it was clear that Hearn’s attempt to increase the 1-megabyte limit had failed. As a result, he sold his bitcoins and ceased his involvement with the currency. Two days later, bitcoin’s value had dropped by nearly 15 per cent.
How to increase block size continued to be a problem without a solution. So when a possibly elegant workaround was publicised, many took notice.
Segregated Witness, or segwit, is a suite of technical improvements to the bitcoin network that allows users to have their cake and eat it: it provides a way to effectively increase the 1-megabyte limit without actually changing it.
The trick is that segwit removes some of the data included with each transaction and stores it elsewhere. This reorganisation quadruples the limit size. And yet, it is backwards-compatible. Users will still be able to run older versions of the bitcoin software. And you won’t need to quadruple your processing power to join the bitcoin club.
Since being released in October last year, segwit has been slowly growing in popularity, and now has about 30 per cent support on the bitcoin network – compare that with the 15 per cent at which Hearn’s 8-megabyte solution peaked. If support can hit 95 per cent and stay there for two weeks, segwit will be activated.
That may seem a long way off, but there could be a dark horse in the mix. Another digital currency called litecoin is on the cusp of a segwit rollout.
Litecoin’s software is almost identical to bitcoin’s, but the currency’s total value of about $500 million is around a 40th of bitcoin’s. If segwit performs well on litecoin, “bitcoin users will take note”, says Ghassan Karame at NEC Research Laboratories in Heidelberg, Germany. In other words, if the upgrade works for litecoin, it could cause support on bitcoin to rapidly head for the required 95 per cent.
If segwit makes it easier for more people to use cryptocurrencies, it will help bring them into the mainstream. Among its improvements, segwit also clears the path for inclusion of a system called the Lightning Network. This allows any regularly occurring transactions – for example, your daily bus fare – to be batched as a monthly bill instead of being confirmed singly.
That would reduce fees because they wouldn’t need to be paid for every transaction, just the total. Advocates say this could turn bitcoin into an everyday currency, opening up the possibility of easy-to-use bitcoin debit cards, turning bitcoin into a credible competitor for the likes of Visa and Paypal, able to process millions to billions of transactions per second.
But first the stalemate needs to be resolved. “Right now, bitcoin is at an impasse,” says Janssens. “If things don’t change soon, bitcoin will start to lose its importance.”
Oddly enough, that may be exactly what some members of the network would prefer. Some people are already making a lot of money, and going mainstream could lose them their edge.
One group that benefits disproportionately from the current setup is the miners who create bitcoins. Mining is more profitable when members of the bitcoin network must pay fees for transactions – more fees translate to more bitcoin rewards for processing transactions. “If the users say that retail isn’t the way to go, other digital currencies can spring up to do that job instead,” says Andreas Antonopoulos, host of the Let’s Talk Bitcoin podcast.
However, if segwit leads litecoin to success as a retail currency, it might edge out bitcoin. Either way, litecoin’s decision on whether to adopt segwit could end up determining the future of bitcoin. And perhaps the future of cryptocurrency is not bitcoin at all.
What’s so great about bitcoin?
Bitcoin is popular because it’s free from the control of banks or governments.
“Anyone can send money to anyone else in the world with a transaction fee of less than a dollar,” says Andreas Antonopoulos, who hosts the Let’s Talk Bitcoin podcast. Anyone can – but not everyone does (see main article).
Digital currencies like bitcoin exist solely as records stored on computers around the world. That might seem strange, but few traditional currencies are actually linked to physical commodities like gold any more. For example, most US dollars exist only as digital records held by banks.
Why do you trust that these digital 0s and 1s have value? Because governments back them, and other third parties like banks and payment processors like Visa vouch for the transactions.
But governments can devalue a currency by printing extra money. And the 2008 recession showed that banks don’t always operate with their customers’ best interests at heart.
Proponents of digital currencies say they replace these intermediaries with code. The only thing you need to spend digital currency is knowledge of a secret number associated with an online wallet that no one else needs to vouch for.
To check whether a bitcoin transaction is legitimate doesn’t require a central bank. Instead, it is done by a decentralised network of computers that anyone can join. The system is underpinned by the same mathematics that powers encryption, making it incredibly hard to deceive or control without infeasible amounts of computing power. “The system is built to resist hostile takeover,” says Antonopoulos.
It’s not surprising then that since its conception in 2008, bitcoin has gone from being a plaything of hackers to a multibillion-dollar juggernaut. Every day, there are hundreds of thousands of bitcoin transactions, with people sending money around the world with no centralised oversight or government control.
@_date: 2017-04-27 22:41:02
Ah really, so there is a workaround? 
I was worried about the possibility of launching a 51% attack before precautions had been taken by miners, which, even if things recovered would presumably undermine future trust in Bitcoin. 
Sure it would be bad publicity, but it kind of feels like the keys to the nuke are held by single point of failure, which is not a good situation if that point of failure goes loco...

Because the entire crypto sector is rising. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:18:28
Well, not necessarily. In a rising sector Bitcoin could still be doing well fundamentally, but others could be doing even better. 
But my personal take right now is that the fundamentals for Bitcoin look to be under fire. Will be interesting to see how things pan out.
