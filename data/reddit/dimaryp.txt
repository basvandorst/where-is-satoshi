You mean 1000%, right? When did the price grow by a factor of less than 10 in a whole year?

Wait, haven't you heard?
Chuck Norris got an abacus and mined all the remaining Bitcoins himself.

I'm having much fun with this, although I'm stuck on  5 &amp; 13 in section 4...

That's because there's no /s tag. People learn from this unfortunate event and use the /s tag to indicate humor, irony or sarcasm. Hell, use it for serious comments too, just in case. No redditor has to be brutally and wrongfully downvoted because of one simple mistake. See, it's easy: **/s**

So, d, right? That's what I got...

Yeah, I also tried every letter but didn't find anything that makes sense...

Nice! I used HawkHost for a couple of years and have never had an issue. I only recently cancelled my hosting as I don't have a website running.

Is it just me or does the bitcoin-glasses guy seem happier than the dollar-glasses guy?

Well... what the hell... 
Yeah, you're right!

This is 100% correct. Euro notes are better than bitcoin. For the ECB at least.
@_date: 2014-04-12 18:34:53
I thought of that but I don't see the connection.

Since when is the euro on a free fall? 
@_date: 2016-07-05 13:09:35
Oh, yeah. But that was after the bubble caused by the reducening, where the reward for working in southern Europe dropped hugely. The reducening was hard-coded in eurocoin to occur around 10 years after its introduction... Why am I not rich yet? I'm an original euro hodler dammit!

It got approved on btct.co, so there should be another 5 million shares to be sold. I think we can safely wait a few more hours for the announcement.

Wait a moment, you stated that the jackpot odds are 0.1%, in other words 1 in 1,000 cards. If thousands of people have played (only today) shouldn't the jackpot have been given away by now?

Someone needs to code PFC - Protein Folding Coin or something like this.

Would it be possible to allow posts only from accounts that are more than x days old? All posts from younger accounts should get mod approval before being posted and accounts that have submitted spam should get banned.
@_date: 2013-04-29 08:19:13
And that's just the [beggining.]( The European Commisson seems to believe that anyone who has 100.001 € in a bank account is a "big depositor". So If you just sold your house to repay your debt and the EU decides to take your money, then that's just tough shit.

Imagine your wealth being downvoted because you used caps...
I agree though with op's comment, back to -4.
@_date: 2013-04-25 10:38:51
I guess, that's because everytime the sword resets, the current Bitcoin amount goes to the site owner. That's his profit. I bet someone with better math skills than me could figure out the average income per 100 purchases...
@_date: 2013-08-22 07:36:15
Where in the world can you buy currency with a discount for larger purchases? I mean, come on, you have scam written all over your forehead. Reported.

Scammer, don't buy!
@_date: 2013-04-25 12:30:19
I overlooked something. The site owners profit doesn't come solely from the 1 in 200 chance that the sword resets, he also gets a 10% cut from every transaction!

You're being down voted because this question gets asked at least one or two times a day. You could have searched for your answer.

Aaaaand... I got it. Thanks!
