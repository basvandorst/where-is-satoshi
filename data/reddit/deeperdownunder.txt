Bitcoin is for the world not just one person

If this did happen
Would you still be able to buy BTC via exchanges? Any one with a answer with backing to it?

Why do you think that?
Solid evidence or is this subjective ?

What is your source though saying that the majority of all QRKS are owned by the initial miners.  I beleive its still in its infancy and its slowly being distributed accordingly.  To quote another post, saying it lacks distribution is like saying : "because you can't dig up dollar coins from the ground that the US dollar won't widely circulate."

But maybe bitcoin is too far in to go back and change it's foundations?

Why do you believe Quark is a scam ?
Litecoin i agree is a good alternative
