Should make no difference. Nodes will receive all versions of transactions and miners can chose whatever transactions they want in a block.
Depending on the exact method of "sending blocks prior to mining" this will mean that nodes might have to store all versions of transactions, but that shouldn't matter too much. That technology isn't out yet afaik.

Sorry to report you are in the 2%. You should probably use SPV.
@_date: 2015-06-04 04:07:50
I'm thinking of the argument that SPV shouldn't be used for businesses, people, etc. for various reasons (privacy?). My post is to demonstrate that most US peoples and business could still take advantage of a full node without significant impact to their bandwidth.
If you want to be able to relay a block to contribute, you only need to relay it so one other person to remain a 1:1 peering:seeding ratio.
Therefore your upload speed only needs to be = 5.33 mbps (by your math). This is about half of the average US upload speed via [netindex](
This is of course at the DDOS maximum under average block finding times and conditions. Under "luckly" 6 minute block finding times we might have to spread the upload over 60 seconds.
@_date: 2015-06-04 04:39:29
You can limit the amount you want to seed the blocks.
The long term goal for internet providers is to provide more bandwidth and eliminate or raise metered internet limits.

.768mbps would be good enough to run a non-participating full node AT ITS PEAK. Even absolute worst cast a period of maxed out blocks in a lucky period of 6 minute blocks you'd have enought (although it would take 30-70% of your bandwith).
Luke-jr demonstrated in a different post that the currently the bitcoin will (/would) only effect your bandwidth 1-5% on a normal basis.
@_date: 2015-06-04 04:28:06
Not necessary.
If the block size is on average 300kb = 600kb cap, and black friday doors open at 6am and we get 10x normal = 6mb blocks immediately that would cause congestion that would grind the system to a halt until the cap is slowly raised over the course of a few hours to days.

Thanks for making this point. I didn't mention the distinction in my post.
I'm talking exclusively about non-contributing nodes, as: 
* I'm sure contributing nodes that must remain anonymous can set up their own method for doing so (and will be rewarded as normal) (thepiratebay doesn't use tor for instance).
* 30 seconds may even be too high. We want to lower the orphan rate so miners will do everything to minimize download times and maximize upload times.
Non-Contributing Nodes:
* We're talking about a **maximum** on average, .2667 is enough to decently run a full node. There may be times when the average block time rises to 6 minutes, making it .6 mbps (still far below 6mbps).
* We can assume that we won't hit the max size consistantly, so .2667 may still be a very safe estimate (5mb block / 5 minutes, etc)

In terms of UTXO (some day possibly not all nodes will need to save all old transactions); is RBF more efficient disk-space wise then CPFP?
@_date: 2016-01-12 20:56:25
Only if you had opted-in! CPFP might be a better solution in that case; since it doesn't require you to opt-in.
@_date: 2016-01-12 18:45:17
That's essentially the point of opt-in rbf is that the transaction and all it's outputs have opted-in. Also see: [Why not FSS-RBF? (First-seen-safe Replace-by-fee)](

Yes; It's opt-in so if you don't want to be defrauded, don't opt in.
The core devs would say that double spending 0-conf (or really anything less then ~7-conf) was always part of the design of bitcoin. Really this patch was made to help double spending be more acceptable by allowing transactions to opt-into it. The reason they want to do that is for efficiency, not defrauding.

See: [Why did the Core Devs push for RPF?](

@_date: 2016-01-12 03:05:54
Good question! 
No, the government could not reverse the transaction using opt-in RBF since Edward Snowden wouldn't have opted-in to RBF when he sent the transaction. Only transactions that opt-in to RBF can be replaced by fee using the Opt-in RBF feature.

It's basically 99% altcoin except you can trade the coins 1:1. So by default it's another blockchain to split the workload (though I guess theoretically you could invent something other than a blockchain and use that for the altcoin).

Hey Peter.
I still am having a really hard time finding information about how SPV as implemented in bitcoinj is not a "true" SPV system.
The Bitcoin whitepaper which defined SPV says:

This actually happened to Feathercoin: 
Basically what the attackers chose to do is orphan a bunch of real blocks. The Feathercoin developers "fixed" this by implementing a feature where the developers picked and continually published which chain was the "legitimate" one for clients to use instead of relying on whichever chain was the longest.
This isn't a real fix because it made the altcoin centralized instead of decentralized. Decentralized means you trust that 51% of the hashing power is legitimate.

I can provide a counter argument against your "any" claim.
If you want to transfer money between a web service (such as virwox.com) and your personal finances you have to either use a bank transfer which would take 1-3 days or use Bitcoin which takes ~80 minutes.
This time advantage doesn't require Bitcoin core. It can be achieved with a web service or a SPV wallet.
Therefore because I can provide 1 advantage that doesn't require Bitcoin core, your point is invalid. You must re-phrase it to "some" benefits instead of any.

Yeah, I'm thinking of like from an "implications of IPv6" level as it will likely be used as it rolls out.
In example: before if you torrented at a University, for instance, a copyright company couldn't pin you just from the ip address they record you torrenting from (though the University has logs that could locate you), now with IPv6 if they can prove you were using a certain ip, then it's indisputable who it was that was torrenting (or sending a bitcoin transaction, etc.)

The effect of "both sides of the fork continue living with non-negligible amounts of users" is of theoretical concern. It's possible but unlikely at best. The best forks (like BIP 66) have consensus ratio of higher than &gt;50% so it can't "split in two" but at best split into a much larger and a much smaller piece.
Most (non-validating) spv bitcoin software (i.e. most wallets) are set to use the longest available chain in the case of a fork, so most people are fine. Bitcoin Core throws an alert if there's a longer non-valid chain available. If people use checkpointing to circumvent this then they aren't likely to be confused and lose money, they are just using a different currency basically.

The problem is a ton of things in Bitcoin need a hardfork to be fixed. Examples: script commands, protocol consistency, etc. See here: 
Properly planned hard forks don't need to be a pain. The web experiences "Hard forks" all the time. Features are introduced (like html5) and start becoming mainstream after a certain percent of the market upgrades their browsers.
In terms of the fear that money could be lost, security issues, etc. That can all be mitigated by careful planning. Hard forks shouldn't be reckless (i.e. we are rolling out hard forks to miners right now without voting) but at the same time saying hard forks can't ever happen is possibly dangerous (some problems in the past were "hard forks" in a sense that had to be fixed immediately).

would love corrections here since I don't know a whole lot about lightning:
Another way of explaining it is: If A sends money to B and B sends money to C it's the same thing as A sending money to C, and only that A-&gt;C needs to be recorded.
 Is lightning complicated?
Compare the paper (59 pages) :   
To the bitcoin paper (9 pages):  
 Does lightning have risks?
Yes, some of them are listed in the paper. There may be other non-discovered ones. Same with like Bitcoin, but these risks are in addition to Bitcoin's.
 Why is lightning more scalable?
Transactions in Bitcoin require everyone using Bitcoin full nodes/miners to know about them. Transactions in lightning only require ? parties to know about them (I'm assuming it's less then regular Bitcoin but I actually don't know).
 Will lightning actually work/happen?
Unclear. Why? 
Imagine the only way of talking right now is by sending everyone on earth a message and hoping the recipient gets it. Right now it's possible/likely this method is scalable but some people are worried about it.
Now imagine there's another method of talking to someone that involves knowing a chain of friendship (i.e. 6 degrees of kevin bacon) and passing the message along (in lightning the message can't be changed and probably won't be lost).
What if your target friend speaks a different language or there's no one-language-route to your friend? Then you can't use this method and you'd have to fall back to the first method.

     [02:45:18]  &lt;~~~~~~~~&gt;	If it were a wide enough interest we could have an address type with a flag eventually.

RPF or replace by fee is a way of enabling pending transactions to be modified -- or double spent.
The implementation that was merged was opt-in RBF, meaning transactions can be marked double spendable or not.

**What is RBF?**

Yeah thanks for answering the questions in this thread. I think it's done a lot of good in helping people understand what's happening.
@_date: 2015-11-29 23:39:40
Assuming perfect IBLT or better, is Opt-in RBF more efficient than CPFP after pruning?
@_date: 2015-11-30 01:01:15
From what I understand there's compression use cases other than modifying fee: [transaction cut-through](
@_date: 2015-11-29 22:16:31
Efficiency, the goal is to be able to modify transactions while they are pending to fit more transactions into smaller blocks.
	[02:26:52]  &lt;andychase&gt;	So, again, this is a form of transaction compression?
	[02:27:00]  &lt;andychase&gt;	I mean it's fine if this is only an optimization
	[02:27:10]  &lt;andychase&gt;	but if so, please let me know so that I can understand it with that context
	[02:27:53]  &lt;~~~~~~~~~&gt;	Yes. Though it's not just 'only an optimization' since the reduction is unbounded. (internally, it's bounded by how long they sit around unconfirmed and the ability to participate)

Is the eventual plan to opt-in as many RPF transaction as possible? I'm just thinking of PR 
Does Core plan on enabling this by default?
@_date: 2015-11-29 22:19:43
First-seen-safe means that transactions can only be modified if all previous outputs are fully spent. This prevents double spends.
The problem with FSS is when you spend money you are signing the "change" (think like quarters, nickles, type change) over back to yourself.
Since FSS requires that change output to be fully spent as well, you might not have any money to add to the transaction.
That's the reason why FSS isn't seen as useful, but that's not the reason the core devs didn't jump straight for it.
The Core devs want to use Opt-in RBF to "compress" transactions and FSS-RBF Doesn't allow that.
@_date: 2015-11-29 22:28:43
Specifically it doesn't allow the *sender* to use it without change. The receiver can add fees using CPFP. A sender can make sure they include a change transaction (most transactions do) so they are able to add fees if needed.
@_date: 2015-11-30 19:33:02
Yeah I'm not sure where this meme comes from. There's currently risk associated with 0-conf but it's not 100% likely to be able to be double-spent. The risk is manageable.
The security is implicit rather than explicit, but is currently essential for low-value transactions to happen quickly. I get that 0-conf is annoying and other "fast-transaction" solutions can be implemented-- those solutions aren't available yet.
@_date: 2015-11-30 19:39:20
Hey To answer your question bluntly: there's no use cases.
In terms of "what's possible" you can add fees using CPFP, though it will be slightly more expensive then RBF in terms of fees.
The core devs will tell you that RBF is more efficient and has the use cases of compressing transactions, but it depends how you look at it. There's higher mempool usage, but same network usage, same disk usage after pruning i.e. the uxto effect is the same, etc..
@_date: 2015-11-29 22:25:43
 Why wasn't it used for RBF?
It doesn't solve the same problem. Core devs are looking for compressing transactions, not necessarily adding fees alone.
Well specifically adding fees and compressing transactions, and don't like CPFP as much because it requires a separate transaction.
Both RBF  and CPFP will end up being used.
@_date: 2015-11-29 22:21:54
The public reason is that the Core Devs want to make bitcoin as efficient as possible and keep small blocks is so it works well with Tor and bad internet connections.
Is this important? I think this is a very sensitive topic:
	[02:14:16]  &lt;~~~~~~~~~&gt;	I'm really not going to waste my time debating with you if efficiency is important to the bitcoin system. Basically if you're going to argue that it's not, I'm going to insist that you don't use my software and don't waste my time.
@_date: 2015-11-30 19:41:11
This is a good question. I personally think CPFP is a better solution then FSS.
@_date: 2015-11-29 22:14:31
**Why did the Core Devs push for RPF?**
@_date: 2015-11-29 23:02:08
double spending means you are re-using the same inputs in two transactions.
A miner won't accept two transactions with the same input into a block-- that would make the block invalid.
@_date: 2015-11-29 22:24:22
 What is it?
Child pays for parent is a way of adding fees to a transaction by making an another transaction that depends on the first.
Child pays for parent is going to happen, some mining pools already support it:
	[02:01:15]  &lt;~~~~~~~~&gt;	I expect we'll have CPFP mining in 0.13, as it's just the rational thing for miners to do... though it won't be fully usable until we change how relay works in the p2p protocol.

I'm no expert, so I hope someone can confirm this:
In the American justice system, there are *no* do-overs. 
Someone is tried exactly once in front of a Jury. If the prosecutor does some foul play (presents evidence that was thrown out of the court i.e.) then the trial is taken to a court where justices judge whether or not the trial was fair. This can bubble up to at most the supreme court depending on certain factors.
No foul play = jury ruling stands.
Unfairness can include ambiguity of the law in cases where there's not a clear precedent but this is uncommon and it's up to the higher courts to decide if this is happening.

I'm not sure.. it seems to me the network load is the same-- repeat transactions modified vs new ones. CPU load is worse, but depends on CPFP implementation, disk load after pruning should be the same.
Might require merkle tree commit hash for pruning.
