I still give a fuck and buy the dips. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:11:25
The burden of proof must be on them. They must provide an audit and transparency. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:10:26
How, when they’re used to buy crypto?
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:44:47
This is good news. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:04:10
So happy. We need some breathing room and more time to outpace the regulators. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:32:48
This needs to be on the front page...
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:10:42
We should worry about both. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:59:15
You seem to believe the government gives a shit about the people it rules.  That's never been the case.
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:01:50
Moved all my coins to Segwit :)
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:58:32
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:12:16
If the billions of USDT is being used to buy crypto though, it is a concern. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:36:55
Best crypto YouTuber by far. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:43:02
Nah, we need more time.
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:33:02
I always buy the dip ;)
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:30:13
Doug Polk has the best crypto channel out there right now. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:40:53
That’s been a staple of government since the beginning of government. Only way to solve this is to end the state. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:54:20
This 
@_date: 2018-01-27 06:28:54
Dude is too old to string together a single sentence...
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:38:44
I wish this was an actual shutdown, and i wish this was forever. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:58:13
Yeah... Satoshi and Roger
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:34:15
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:13:18
The technology is why I’m here. I happen to have made some money along the way, so my desire to watch hr succeed is even higher
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:05:14
My response: Ok... what about segwit and batching transactions? Not much use having better customer service when you’re destroying the product you’re trying to serve.
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:31:31
@_date: 2018-01-27 06:32:05
Great vid as always. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:10:00
How do you explain the billions of USDT that have been printed with no audit?
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:13:13
Voted no so they have a false sense of security...
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:44:40
Added along with my  tag
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:08:20
It’s quite concerning. We need an audit. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:17:26
This will keep changing indefinitely...
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:09:58
Fuck that guy
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:07:20
Basically, transactions from a SegWit address are much cheaper.
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:06:12
Me too, can I get some upvotes as well?
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:02:19
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:34:42
Bitconnect is a ponzi scheme scam like we all knew.  This is a cease and desist order.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:35:28
No time table? I’ll believe it when i see it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:53:20
Phase 2 is actually buy the dip. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:34:52
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:25:22
Yes, VERY low fees.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:05:07
We must support this man. He is the best voice in the crypto community. Please contribute on Patreon. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:34:42
This would be huge for Andreas’ idea of “streaming money.”
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:33:34
I grabbed some BTC and watched. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:21:30
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:40:52
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:18:07
Awesome, thanks man!
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:18:19
Its a woman
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:56:10
This is the best news I’ve seen in awhile. Well deserved!
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:23:41
People with a ton of coins, can move the market. Someone just sold a ton, a whale. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:02:46
Everyone should boycott coinbase until they implement segwit and batched transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:31:42
Wait, the news lied?!? There’s a first time for everything!
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:06:00
Join any major media outlet. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:00:17
Guys, I just created a coin that is so cheap and fast! It has 0.5 second block times and 1G block size. Give me your money?
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:31:01
Taxation is theft. Why can’t we do that voluntarily?
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:57:38
Everyone should help support him whatever way you can. He is the best voice in crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:27:23
No, that will be Rothbard. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:44:02
Are you delusional?
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:00:31










Great explanation, thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:41:15
That's awesome!
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:36:36
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:48:16
Yes, one of the best. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:02:47
God Feinstein is the worst. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:06:03
ELI5 please
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:55:00
I bought :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:02:04
Better yet, but on GDAX, not coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:00:54
Agreed, should be a prereq before buying Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:04:29
Cough Ripple cough 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:00:37
The core devs
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:31:10
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:39:58
Me want.
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:43:54
How close are we to implementation?
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:22:20
Yes, it is a myth that keeps getting propagated. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:59:54
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:47:23
Where’s matt?
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:24:41
Never leave your private keys with someone else. Not your keys, not your bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:12:33
Of course, just like you'd expect from a Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:16:32
I prefer my trezor. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:33:48
Thank you for putting this together.  Moving to Bitstamp.
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:56:28
Taxation is theft 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:09:31
She’s pure evil. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:27:00
Because they are taking in people's money and promising insane returns due to their completely nebulous trading platform.  They have an affiliate program and scammy YouTubers promoting it.  The idea is to keep taking in more money at the base of the Pyramid, a classic Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:05:38
Also to remove the Ponzi scheme, Bitconnect.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:30:44
Well now we gotta make this happen.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:46:02
What was their response on Bitconect?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:24:59
ELI5 please 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:24:55
This is the same idiot that promised Amazon would be accepting Bitcoin and constantly spams my instagram and facebook with adds touting his "tricks" for investing in crypto...
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:43:36
I’m a Patreon supporter. I suggest others join. He’s the best voice in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:04:30
That’s my strategy and he’s worked great. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:10:30
Everyone please spread this on social media!
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:25:25
This is hilarious!
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:54:33
Wow, scary
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:46:54
They are offering insane daily returns with absolutely no actual real product.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:21:22
You are an absolute hero!
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:12:19
Can you explain or point to a site explaining port forwarding?
Also, approximately how much would this cost to do?
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:25:36
Yep, hope everyone bought the dip hard. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:32:35
Yep, it’s quite a good scam. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:06:54
What’s this gonna do to price?!? ;)
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:19:36
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:23:33
Is there a negative value I can choose?
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:00:43
This. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:45:59
No idea.  Not at home now, but I'll take a look.
Can I buy a cheap very cheap computer just to do this?  At the moment I only have a work computer.
Bitcoin has been very good to me, and I'd like to give back!
@_date: 2015-06-26 00:42:13
That's exactly what I did.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:02:34
Cough ripple cough
@_date: 2015-06-26 00:45:27
Don't forget to show them some love here:
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:17:49
Agreed. We need to spread far and wide to make the inevitable crackdown more difficult. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:19:33
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:39:37
Hilarious 
@_date: 2015-12-05 01:19:09
Because the US government does whatever the hell it wants...
@_date: 2015-06-26 00:41:30
Yes, a friend of mine in the U.S.  I just snapped a photo of the BitPagos QR code and he paid directly.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:09:48
Excellent idea!
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:46:30
Can we report that ad?
@_date: 2015-06-25 14:41:12
I went there multiple times and paid in Bitcoin. One time I had a friend buy it for me from over 5,000 miles away. Great people and great coffee!
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:13:29
Let’s get rid of all taxes altogether. Taxation is theft. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 04:53:09
Here is a pic of some of the coffee I bought there - 
@_date: 2015-12-23 15:25:01
Operation Chokdpoint is absolutely horrifying. I guess no different than anything else the state does though... I tweeted back to Daniel that he should look into Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 16:03:12
I’m very concerned, but blame the state for that. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 02:10:34
I member
@_date: 2018-05-22 00:11:03
All good, buy that dip too!
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:58:05
Paper wallet. Never leave more than spending money online. 2FA for everything. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:03:14
I think this exactly what happened. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 22:01:28
How is this getting downvoted?
@_date: 2014-07-17 21:14:15
I hope you're joking...
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:50:08
Coin Central is doing great work. Hoping for more news like this!
@_date: 2014-07-24 02:44:20
Having 1 California is what is insane.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:17:55
How can he be sued for distributing information?
They only people who are criminals here are at MtGox who have likely committed fraud and potentially theft.
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:40:11
This is important. Exchange ticket sent. Also make sure to tweet at them and the winklevii. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:51:06
Make sure to write Support tickets and tweet at Gemini / the Winklevoss twins. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:53:29
Yay!  More mafia money!
@_date: 2014-07-19 17:12:55


They do realize all of this.  That's the whole point of this, to crush the Bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2018-05-15 13:40:24
Who wants to post on r/btc?
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:14:38
Yes.  He should go to jail for fraud.
EDIT: He should not be jailed, but be forced to do everything in his power to make things whole for his victims.
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:38:16
Other - Cold storage wasn't actually cold, bitcoins were stolen, and they never audited their funds.
@_date: 2014-03-08 03:13:35
"What scares me is if this truly unregulated currency means that governments are simply unable to tax their citizens because they can't keep track of where/when money moves."
That would be the ideal scenario.  Government would be unable to function, and would have to go away.  We'd finally have peace and a vibrant free market.
@_date: 2014-03-19 05:09:03
Government regulations.  Market regulation and property rights enforcements are great.
@_date: 2014-03-10 04:48:43
Better than 1 person controlling the entire monetary system.
@_date: 2014-06-06 00:02:40
Yes, that is how it is supposed to work, but that is not how the government puts things into practice.
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:30:05
Some people just donated 2 and 2.44 BTC.  Awesome!
Edit: And that someone was apparently @_date: 2014-02-24 16:21:34
Mt. Gox has support?
@_date: 2014-05-01 01:35:07
Better money is just the beginning :)
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:51:52
Clarification in this case is horrible since they clarified with a complete bullshit stand that will cripple Bitcoin commerce. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 01:44:23
@_date: 2014-04-30 21:56:36
If this doesn't convince you Bitcoin is a huge threat to the system, I don't know what will. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:28:36
Wow, Nas is one of my favorite artists, but this really puts him up a notch in my book.
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:41:54
"They have to prove you spent it (or rather, you have to prove you didn't)."
You must not know how the U.S. "justice" system works.  There is no presumption of innocence anymore.
@_date: 2014-04-10 05:08:13
Not much worse than America, and probably a lot more free in many ways. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:15:01
Someone was shorting bitcoin which means they were effectively betting the price would go down.  Since the price actually went up, they were "liquidated" which means they lost all of the money the put into that bet.  In this case, it was somewhere between 80K and 8M lost since you can "leverage" this bet up to 100x.
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:14:14
Well that stuff is all nonsense. Economy and philosophical libertarianism is not. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 16:53:59
Violence isn't the answer to their violence.  Peace is the only way to end their rule. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 03:32:17
Zero regulations would be "sufficient."
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:50:52
The foundation should disband. There should be no centralized organization speaking on the behalf of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:46:12
Eventually men with guns will come to your house to throw you in a cage. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 11:52:05
Wow. Complete and utter bullshit. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:37:44
He is a hero. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 00:38:11
There is a 0% chance that arrogant asshole is Satoshi.  Or if you listen to Craig, a negative percent change.
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:57:43
Wow, this is HUGE!  I do all my bookings (except for Southwest) through Expedia.
@_date: 2014-03-30 11:11:16
Yes, being forced to pay taxes at the barrel of a gun is slavery. I don't see how anybody could possibly see things differently. It's just a fact. My body and my property are claimed by government. 
@_date: 2014-07-23 17:37:55
You mean that government "regulations" had the opposite effects as stated and helped the big corporations?  Shocking!
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:11:52
There have been numerous reports of this sort of thing happening.
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:50:25
On the bad side - everything else.
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:09:07
Yes everybody, just bend over and pay your extortion money to you masters!
@_date: 2014-11-21 22:37:39
Just when I thought that guy couldn't get any dumber...
@_date: 2014-02-24 10:33:08
Natural law does work that way. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 00:22:24
I can't prove he isn't, so he must be.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:55:09
They are protecting people from themselves.  Maybe they finally realized how incompetent of a company they are?
@_date: 2018-05-15 01:45:35
This is great news!
@_date: 2014-04-29 04:08:40
Sent a message.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:32:50
Yes, it certainly stopped an older, respectable gentleman in a suit from stealing $65 billion from his office.  Oh wait...
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:03:40
I agree, they aren't going to catch every person who disobeys their rules, but the fact is, they will still throw you in a cage if they want to for violating those rules.  That hangs over everyone's head who doesn't abide by their dictates.
@_date: 2014-07-02 10:57:11
Is this like the IRS's technical problem?
@_date: 2014-02-18 05:02:10
Somebody needs to learn about base sizes. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 01:05:26
Given the NYT report, they are working on a custody solution. That is the major thing keeping institutions completely on the sidelines. This is indeed very big news. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 00:10:15
It was the media I’m pretty sure
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:33:26
Nas on stage talking about Bitcoin: 
@_date: 2014-03-28 05:30:40
I think this is my favorite Bitcoin article to date.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:17:21
It could just be that the incompetent people at Gox brought in some incompetent people to fix the situation.
@_date: 2014-03-31 13:38:05
How bout instead of preventing people from buying drugs in a manner they choose, we get rid of the prescription system?
@_date: 2014-05-30 00:03:05
For those who don't like math, Dish Network is ~75x larger than Overstock (27.33B vs. 365.94M).
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:37:35
Nope.  He is a piece of shit that caused untold harm to thousands of people due to his incompetence.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:20:00
If you've actually done the research to inform yourself, then yes.
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:39:02
I think your confusing freedom with the current system we have in which your current fears of the wealthy and powerful controlling everything is already occurring. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:59:47
Congrats guys!  Between Amazon and Whole Foods, I now do 90% of my shopping with Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-05-22 23:05:06
ELI5 how propagation works and how it can be improved.  Also, my understanding is that BCH will have much worse propagation times, what are the risks of that?
@_date: 2014-07-20 13:00:19
Arresting/imprisoning anybody for "money laundering" is unjust.
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:24:26
The exchange market is extremely concentrated. That's my whole point. If we had a free market without very strict government licensing regulations, there would be more exchanges. Especially in the U.S.
More exchanges would mean more competition which would likely mean the worst players get weeded out faster. When there are only a few exchanges to keep up with high demand, it is easier for the worse exchanges to stick around. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:49:32
That's exactly what those criminals expect.
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:28:25
Who the fuck is still buying things from BFL?
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:12:34
Yeah, this is the best
@_date: 2014-03-28 04:16:30
I don't.  That's why I'll bend over hand over my money to the criminal gang in Washington to avoid getting robbed and raped.
@_date: 2014-03-13 14:18:44
My time is valuable and I'm not going to listen to a show where the host believes in nonsense conspiracy theories.  Last thing we want is for Bitcoin to be associated with that kind of stuff. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 20:46:56
They will throw you in a cage and murder you if you resist their kidnapping if you boycott this (like with every government law).
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:41:42
I don't think these guys can handle that kind of simple logic...
@_date: 2014-03-26 06:57:15
Libertarians don't want a government, much less government regulations.
@_date: 2018-05-25 16:26:38
You're welcome ;)
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:09:37
I don't care about fluctuations. I only care about the protocol and government regulations. Unfortunately, I think the latter is extremely important for the price of Bitcoin.

Warren Buffet is also a fan of big government. The guy gets a few things right, but he isn't an authority on everything.

Video description: Without government run central banks and inflationary currencies, engaging in war is much more difficult. Stefan Molyneux speaks about the potential of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to end war and brainstorms on how it would be possible start a war in a bitcoin economy. Speech recorded on April 12th at the Toronto Bitcoin Expo 2014.
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:18:01
Great speech as usual from Molyneux.

Awesome, very clear. Thanks!

Who exactly was the victim of Charlie's alleged actions?  No victim, no crime.
@_date: 2014-01-17 01:02:13
They do this all the time.  It's called asset forfeiture.
@_date: 2018-05-18 23:24:40
Zimbabwe is a prime example of why we need Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:48:04
You don't have to?  Tell that to all the people that have been locked up and/or further robbed for not paying. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:23:24
People saw an inflated pride and wanted to buy there rather than exchanges selling for cheaper?
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:53:20
None. Learned my lesson in Bitcoin security after I got hacked for 40 BTC. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:05:07
Haha, love it. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 00:45:36
Alright, that makes sense.
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:10:09
Yep, they just fucked everyone as usual.
@_date: 2014-10-31 21:03:39
Or we can just get rid of the government and there will be no need to track their spending :)

Welcome to the club

Great job Amanda and other Free Staters!
@_date: 2014-03-14 08:42:34
What that means is they will do whatever government agents tell them to do. It's pretty clear that there has never been rule of law in the US. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 15:50:07
99.9% of government laws are illegitimate. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 04:50:31
Great news!  I can't wait to calculate my tax money I supposedly owe every time I make a purchase!  To the moon!
@_date: 2014-01-29 04:48:56
It sure would be nice if they did that :)
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:42:38
In the Bitcoin world, I think it would be significantly easier and cheaper to build up a new brand instead of having to overcome the negative stigma of MtGox.
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:31:31
Shorting in a bull market. Smart
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:51:55
Yep, cloud mining is a scam. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:20:17
Yep, like all tax laws, this is completely ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:14:50
Yep, nailed it. But it's not good for those treating it like an investment either because some of Bitcoin's value is derived from its use as a currency. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 00:05:22
What happens if you don't abide by their terrible regulations?  They throw you in jail (and they'll kidnap you against your will if necessary).  What happens if you resist your jailing?  They'll shoot you.
Same as with any law the government enforces.
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:59:26
The government asks for "voluntary" cooperation knowing full well that the next step they'll take is not so voluntary...
@_date: 2018-05-10 13:15:36
You are a hero and an inspiration!
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:25:54
This is just fucking ridiculous.  If people actually abided by this, it would be crippling for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:03:05
Join the club.  Add this to the list of numerous laws and felonies ( each of us breaks every single day.
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:18:38
Thanks for the all caps summary. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:35:51
You're forced to pay for those services...
@_date: 2014-07-18 04:09:28
Don't give that piece of shit any money. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:59:23
Yes, record the calls. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 20:20:48
How about no government regulations?  That was easy, and no possibility of running behind. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 20:08:27
I never thought that. That's my point, government is terrible. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:43:10
No rules?  There are tons of regulations already stifling Bitcoin here in the U.S.  That is one primary reason why people were trading on MtGox.  They didn't really have any alternatives because the government has made it nearly impossible at the moment to have a "legal" exchange here in the U.S.  
If we had a free market, there would be more competition, and these terrible companies would go away much more quickly.
@_date: 2014-07-18 00:11:00
Lol, like those tyrants give a shit about our comments.
@_date: 2014-03-26 06:12:07
Health insurance in America is a free market, haha!  It's one of the most regulated industries in the country, hence why it is a total disaster.
Watch this if you want a good history of their destruction of the industry - 
Organized crime lord is synonymous with politician, and there are no countries not run by a violent monopoly yet.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:43:30
So is this the feds moving the money they stole from Ross?
@_date: 2014-01-07 04:25:14
Great news!
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:43:27
That would indeed be huge. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:25:52
Democracy itself can never work, and this is just one small reason why. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 16:00:40
Because the U.S. government is a tyrannical, violent criminal organization and these people are scared of having its violence brought upon them despite no wrongdoing.

Great idea. Followed.

Use paper wallets in the future.

Yes, theft is natural...
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:43:28
But your argument is that the mugger has the RIGHT to mug me...

@_date: 2014-04-10 04:43:56
I don't understand why people couldn't accept (and still can't) that this was happening.
@_date: 2014-07-18 04:07:43
You seem to think regulators give a shit about us or the problems their tyrannical laws create for us. They don't. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 04:02:06
A dramatic decrease of state power. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:35:04
Good stuff. Overall, probably positive for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 23:02:58
Hero. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:40:15
So if a mugger comes up to me to steal my property that I rightfully own, you're telling me its my choice to be robbed and I should just leave?
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:34:50
Excellent!  Thank you for putting your expertise to work!
@_date: 2014-11-30 02:03:14

"I want to make them explain how they have authority over this and why..."
They're the government.  They are a criminal gang and can do whatever they want.  No governments follow their own laws.

I could care less about the money so long as bitcoin helps to bring down the state. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:27:16
Yep, the real objective is control and money as always.

We can all chip in, plus companies could sponsor him. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 13:18:06
Alright, then this is meaningless.  The survey was programmed to carry forward responses that were typed in during earlier questions. 
I created a lot of surveys for my job, so I know how this works.

I told a friend who was interested in crypto to avoid Ripple because it was a scam. He didn't listen and lost $12,000. Could have been much worse though...
@_date: 2014-03-26 05:50:37
Haha, I really hope you're being sarcastic. That is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:21:44
Yep, though so many here were begging for regulation.  Well here you go!  Happy now?
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:55:29
Sure, have you seen how terrible the roads are, and how expensive all government projects are.  That is what you get when you have an unaccountable monopoly that is funded by force.  In a free market, you'd have competing companies, trying to offer the best services at the lowest price.
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:15:02
That's me hope :)
@_date: 2014-06-09 03:55:41
It is very unlikely that somebody from the incredibly small Bitcoin community would come by you to give you a tip.  If you want tips, you have to post where there is a higher chance of encountering people that actually have Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-02 02:28:22
No, you absolutely cannot.  That would not be libertarian at all. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:14:31
Great stuff as always for both of them.
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:11:20
I believe in peace, so yes I'm a libertarian. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 00:12:46
Straight up robbing us through taxes isn't enough.  They want more of our money whenever possible.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:57:31
Yep, precisely.  Unless they bought the thing for like $1,000, this is one of the worst investments I've ever seen.  The best PR people in the world couldn't turn this sinking ship around.  
If the stolen funds stories are true, this was one of the worst run companies of all time, losing about $1B at peak bitcoin prices.
@_date: 2014-06-08 03:50:16

@_date: 2014-02-12 06:28:30
Yes, I'm sure plenty of government officials have used bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:12:51
Yep, just the excuse the government wanted to start cracking down more.  Get ready for some terrible Bitcoin regulations.
@_date: 2014-04-10 05:06:12
Living as a slave everywhere is pretty confusing. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:30:35
Why can't the government just stop their violence for once?  More regulations to hinder the Bitcoin marketplace...
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:26:07
True.  In an ideal world he would not go to jail, but be forced to pay restitution to his victims.  So I guess I misspoke when I said "jail."  Jail isn't the answer.  Making the victims whole is.
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:16:37
Great, the most untrustworthy people on the planet, the police, support her story. Now I believe it...
@_date: 2014-03-13 04:47:14

@_date: 2014-03-05 21:47:10
Agreed. Is never support anybody in government. Some are better than others though. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 13:10:49
You do if you don't want them to point their guns at you...

He is one of the world's greatest living heroes.
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:54:30
I’m a libertarian but bitcoin should be very attractive to the left. It takes away power from banks and corporations. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:59:52
Amen. 
Surprised you left even 1 BTC on Gox though. Would have expected you to not go anywhere near that terrible company. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 11:33:45
That was absolutely hilarious and will certainly raise awareness of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:33:52
Yep :)

It looks like it was specifically crafted by the gods for memes.

Yes, please master, give me extra time to beg and grovel at your feet.
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:25:07
Great stuff, pledged!  Can you put some Twitter, Facebook, etc. stuff on there to make this easier for people to share?
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:54:53
This is standard procedure unfortunately.  The government practices asset forfeiture all the time.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:20:02
Whoever is dumb enough to buy Mt. Gox isn't smart enough to turn it around.
@_date: 2014-07-25 09:11:26
Nothing the government does is "good" because all of it requires the initiation of force on peaceful people. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:02:54
Look at that fucking smirk on that guy's face. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:20:03
Probably produced by a consultant.
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:48:09
I really like this type of thing.  Good stuff.
@_date: 2014-07-17 20:49:35
It is sad. But this is what government does with everything. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:14:14
Holy shit!  They Satoshi so mad that he came out of hiding!
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:40:28
Clueless.

He is going to be VERY, VERY rich in a few years.
@_date: 2014-03-26 23:35:45
I'm sure the statists would welcome that. 
Or a full ban on using/holding. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 16:12:36
I asked for a Bitcoin option and then said Bitpay or Coinbase could set them up so they wouldn't even need to hold bitcoins:
"Thanks for contacting us. At this time we only offer Credit cards and Paypal. I am not sure if Bitcoin will ever be an option but thank you for the feedback."
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:19:30
Very true.  They want to avoid the terrible wrath of the state if at all possible.  Don't want to do anything to provoke the violent thugs.
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:11:39
Haha, hilarious. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:09:40
Mt. Gox deserves to be under the bus.  Run over again and again.
They're the ones who threw their customers and the entire Bitcoin community under the bus.
@_date: 2014-07-17 17:02:19
Congrats to all you statists who were begging your masters for "regulation" (violence)!  Now we can all be further oppressed!
@_date: 2014-08-15 12:04:21
How long have they been talking about this now, and still there is nothing?  More proof that government regulation is intended to protect entrenched corporations and results in a stifling of innovation. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:31:58
Haha, I love Seinfeld. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:05:59
Thanks, yeah I'm almost always on my phone and never have the time or patience to write a well thought out response. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 00:01:21
Yep, this is why I lost 40 BTC...
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:51:55
Why anybody can support the state when they continue to engage in this type of violent behavior is beyond me.
@_date: 2014-03-26 05:43:42
Ideally none of that would be controlled by the state and we'd have a free market for all those services.  Taxation is theft and is thus immoral. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 22:43:25
Tell the government to fuck off.
@_date: 2014-07-20 11:48:11
Oh he gets it. He is just trying to crush it. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 03:23:15
Buy a gyft card to Amazon and get 3% cash back.  Immediately repurchase your bitcoins.  Pretty simple.
@_date: 2014-01-06 02:10:59
You slaves think leaving the country will stop the criminals in Washington from robbing you?  Think again. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 16:37:36
Yes, the state robbing us more and further stifling innovation is great news!
@_date: 2014-01-15 02:43:09
More posts are needed until something is done about it. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:14:52
Newsweek has money?
@_date: 2014-02-28 03:00:16
Wow, surprisingly good statement. Well, except for the part asking for government regulation. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:49:17
Do not KEEP them on an exchange.  If you want to buy or sell, get in, and then immediately get out.
@_date: 2014-07-31 02:29:26
Barely regulated?  What planet do they live on?
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:03:53
Because the criminal organization calling itself the government won't allow it.  If you were to create such a machine, they'd come after you to throw you in a cage. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 03:56:54
Excellent, I can now finance mass murder with Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:11:16
That's me.  I later retracted that statement realizing restitution, and not jail would be the proper course of action.
What is dumb about this post?  Have you not followed the hundreds of stories of police abuse and brutality that happen each year?  
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:58:03
Just when I thought I couldn't lose any more respect from Mark, I see this.

Paper wallets everyone. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 16:44:11
Yeah, it's a great talk. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 20:58:53
Get rid of all of it. Fuck Ben and the other tyrants.

Libertarians have always been against corporations as a legal entity.  Large companies are fine.
What you described in the last 2 paragraphs is exactly what happens today...
@_date: 2014-03-08 05:35:50
Eventually.  That's about all I've got.
@_date: 2014-07-23 20:28:26
Yep, initiatory violence always has negative consequences. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:06:38
Defranco has 3M+ subscribers. They skew young and techy from what I can tell, so this is great. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:59:37
How about just no taxation?
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:03:34
Sweet!  How much was your capital gains tax?
@_date: 2014-02-24 11:31:43
Yep, the made up crime of "money laundering" to facilitate the made up crime of selling drugs. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:14:02
That's because they have zero interest in stopping crime. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:37:10
Because government violence is needed to lay down pavement and fight fires?
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:51:40
Corporations are a government fiction, allowing limited liability for bad actors, that wouldn't exist in a libertarian world.
@_date: 2014-03-31 10:22:56
What free market?
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:31:19
No it isn't. That is just showing what your balanc should be. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 08:18:28
Police have no obligation to protect you, so why would they care?
@_date: 2014-07-14 18:54:14
As an ancap, this is the funniest thing I've ever read on r/bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 19:45:28
Why do people still futilely vote and try to change things through politics?  For whatever reason they just haven't figured out it doesn't work. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:53:12

It would go great (and more importantly be moral).
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:37:30

The Mt. Gox situation provides more reason why regulation should be market based and not governmental.  The regulation that is already present likely caused some of the problem.  Part of the reason why people stuck around on Mt. Gox for so long is that it was one of the few places people could actually get their funds to exchange.  
If the U.S. government would allow people to easily create Bitcoin exchanges here, there would be significantly more competition, and people could have left Mt. Gox.  So, I think further restrictions will exacerbate the problem.
Unregulated markets have issues, but they fix themselves quickly and in a free market, one company's failure doesn't sink an entire industry/economy.  
In the long term, an unregulated Bitcoin market would weed out the bad actors and poor companies.

There has never been a free market in history.  However, it is fairly well accepted by economists that those with the freest markets perform best.
The reason it has never existed is because people believe they need to be ruled over.  They do not realize that the state is an immoral creation that violates the non-aggression principle.  If people come to their senses, there will eventually be a free market (in a similar manner as to how most people eventually came to their senses with slavery).

@_date: 2014-02-28 01:43:58
Unfortunately not.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:32:39
Can you summarize the most important parts of those logs?  A lot to read there.
@_date: 2014-07-13 17:46:53
There are also a strong group of ancaps there - 
@_date: 2014-03-26 16:40:26
I despise We Are Change but really like Molyneux.  This is going to be rough to get through. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 01:02:31
Yes, but now with the absurd tax reporting regulations, could be more difficult.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:02:48
You'd be surprised. For some reason people were still doing business with them despite their numerous previous fuck ups and terrible PR. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:37:38
Haha, amazing.
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:35:18
Lol.  That's the funniest thing I've heard all day.
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:51:48
Haha, anybody who thinks government would be trying to help them hasn't been paying attention to their actions over the last several thousands years. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 04:37:14
@_date: 2014-03-02 16:59:44
Yep, exactly. A usual, regulation creates incredibly high barriers to entry and the result is less competition. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:30:14
You forget how short people's attention span is, and how many times the media has lied/gotten the facts wrong with no repercussion.
@_date: 2014-05-02 22:32:59
What does legality have to do with whether or not the government jails people?
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:50:06
Alex Jones is a moron that makes quick judgements about everything with no evidence.  No way he would actually do research on the topic of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-18 00:06:28
Could be.  That is how it works with all the other terrible government laws that criminalize non-violent behavior.
@_date: 2014-03-26 06:53:13
"Now... what the hell should we do about it?"
Work to abolish the criminal organization known as the government.
@_date: 2014-03-13 02:41:35
Not too much longer.  That's why I'm buying up a lot :)
@_date: 2015-05-01 01:31:32
Patents need to be abolished. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 17:59:52
If he is actually DPR, he is a great boy and a hero. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 09:16:51
Wait the government lied about something?!?!
@_date: 2014-03-30 13:23:42
You don't say...
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:18:08
Why anybody listens to that idiot is beyond me. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 02:25:18
You expect the thugs in the FBI to help you out?
@_date: 2014-04-08 17:23:31
Paper wallets are safe...
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:53:37
Let's hope that most miners don't pay the extortion money to the criminal gang in Washington. 
@_date: 2014-11-28 06:08:49
Nice, wonder if Gyft will decide to match or stick at 5%?
@_date: 2014-03-05 04:35:21
Following Ron Paul and Bitcoin over the last few years, it is very clear that the media does little to no research or fact checking.  They continuously get the story wrong.
@_date: 2014-07-20 06:50:59
Yep, that's their goal. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 01:20:51
I wish I could. Unfortunately that's not an option. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:08:05
The government does not operate by the rule of law.  They just do whatever the fuck they want, whatever suits them best.
@_date: 2014-07-20 06:49:24
There is no presumption of innocence in the U.S.
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:47:15
Exactly.  Every donation, no matter how small can help.
@_date: 2014-03-12 11:56:01
I use it to pay for the vast majority of my purchases (Amazon and Whole Foods).
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:52:37
Haha, brilliant!
@_date: 2014-06-03 16:49:53
Sounds like he may be more of a Dogecoin type of guy.
@_date: 2015-05-01 17:03:19
Absolutely not. Patents destroy untold value. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 20:00:39
Helping launder money for people selling drugs is a positive.
@_date: 2014-07-21 01:09:03
Rand Paul is a statist.
@_date: 2015-05-01 17:02:54
No, I meant all patents. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:17:00
I don't believe Andreas considers himself a libertarian. I'll need to search for the source though. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 21:53:51

Over under on how many Goxxings are left?
@_date: 2014-04-30 04:57:21
Pretty much every department/piece of legislation does exactly what the opposite of its name.  The "Justice" Department is a shining example of that.
@_date: 2014-03-19 17:30:53
You act as if the government is moral and rational. They're not. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:03:40
Haha, you think the 1st amendment is protected. That's rich. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 21:40:07
Bitcoin is currently inflationary.  Inflation = increase in the money supply.
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:45:29
Police are known liars.  Why anybody would believe anything a policeman would say is beyond me.
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:15:52

I'm scared to be in the U.S. and I'm a U.S. "citizen."

What conservatives are in favor of ending central banking?  They all love it.  How else could they fund the mass murder they like so much?

I do all my Amazon shopping and most of my food shopping at Whole Foods using Gyft.
@_date: 2014-03-26 23:29:53
I hope everyone takes this attitude :)
@_date: 2014-07-18 01:47:19
Try not obeying until the very end.  100% guarantee you'll be murdered.
@_date: 2014-03-08 17:32:45
You call hundreds of millions dead over the last century, millions of peaceful people imprisoned, and theft of over half of our income peace?  I guess we have different definitions of peace. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:05:30
You're very lucky to live in a much more economically free country.
@_date: 2015-05-19 03:28:19
Of course it did. That won't stop the violent sociopaths calling themselves the government to lock him in a cage. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 14:50:17
You can kill somebody in self defense, or to defend other nonviolent people. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:12:13
Haha, true.  I guess more of a genius than we thought.
@_date: 2014-03-26 06:51:06
More like a head shot.
@_date: 2014-03-20 06:07:08
Because HSBC poses no threat to them, and the banks are in bed with the government.
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:20:11
Taxation in general is pure theft.
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:04:30
Those were both hilarious.  Shared them.
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:39:32
I want to pay for services I voluntarily agree to.  Not for the mass murder and destruction of the government.
@_date: 2015-05-15 13:06:37
How did they cost money? You can either save with them or send any spare change to a Bitcoin wallet. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 13:02:34

He is obviously a seriously sick individual.  Otherwise, how could he get up every morning and look at himself in the mirror without revolting.
@_date: 2014-01-07 07:49:21
Can't wait to watch this episode.
@_date: 2014-08-03 20:46:24
Agreed.  Begging one's rulers for mercy isn't going to do anything. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 11:16:52
I do mind funding the terrible things that the government is engaged in. Should I be thrown in jail if I don't want to fund it, or killed if I resist?
@_date: 2014-07-21 01:11:14
Is there an evidence for this besides your talks with him?  I hope this is true, but I haven't seen evidence of it.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:27:33
Tyrants like Manchin don't give a fuck about understanding the currency.  They just seek control.
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:14:48
Man, that guy is an idiot.
@_date: 2014-06-12 04:31:41
Was Bitcoin an option in a list of choices earlier in the survey, or did you type it in manually?  Big deal if it is the first, not if the second since they would just pipe in Bitcoin to later questions.
@_date: 2014-07-23 07:15:12
The government has never followed its own laws. What makes you think they'd start now?
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:14:13
It definitely seems like Ross is "guilty," though he committed no real crime since there are no victims.  I really hope the jury nullify and lets him walk free, but I'm assuming they will be good little serfs and find him guilty to be locked him up for a long time.
@_date: 2015-01-22 11:46:57
This is bad. I really hope the jury learns about and utilizes jury nullification. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 21:43:34
I've used bitcoins and never used Tor.

"Nice community, the Bitcoiners."
Well she got one thing right, we are quite a nice community, willing to donate tens of thousands of dollars to those who've been harmed by malicious individuals (Dorian Nakamoto).
@_date: 2015-01-22 04:47:25
There should be no such thing as MSB licenses.  I support anyone who is brave enough to defy the state on this.
@_date: 2015-01-29 03:26:18
Work towards abolishing the state. They will never stop. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 19:58:02
That is how government works.

I completely disagree. I always panic buy and it’s worked out quit well for me!
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:44:13
So, using this tool, what would be the best way to trace my 40 stolen BTC?  Just spend a lot of time expanding on each circle and looking for a common final address? - Stolen from 1NY37Bfkds2PeU5zzYeULzVvcwiJaYpbLW and initially sent to 1GvmpUY1RdR5zf7jDZnpjfuBnoCz3S2xSS

Use GDAX (Coinbase’s exchange) because it has lower fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:25:01
Same haha
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:51:28
Is there a meme for when it hits $10,000 before end of year?

Got it, ok.  I didn't notice a difference in thickness at the time, and when I clicked on the bubbles, it wasn't scrolling to the transaction.  That makes sense, but maybe some figures on the graph as well would be more intuitive?
Site doesn't seem to be working for me at the moment, but I'll try again later.  Thanks!

By 2020, hopefully there would be no need to sell for USD.

Never keep your coins on Coinbase or anywhere else online.  You should hold your private keys.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:57:10
Nobody knows when it is high or low.  That's kinda the point...

He is great. Glad to have him on our side.

Any beginners that want help, feel free to paste below here or DM me. 
Why Bitcoin is important / valuable: For the first time in human history, you can be your own bank. It is a censorship resistant, decentralized, global, system of trust. That has tremendous value any will change the world in so many ways we can’t even imagine. If you factor in the potential (similar to the discounted cash flow of a stock), it’s price is way undervalued in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:15:30
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:36:47

They believe the rise in BTC is due to people buying BTC with Tether, artificially pumping it. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:26:37
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:50:34
Yeah, what's the point of cashing out for fiat now that adoption is finally taking off?
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:39:16

You should not be buying bitcoin until you understand it. You should also not invest / trade until you understand the basics. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:52:43
Interested since 2011.  Probably bought by first BTC in 2012 or 2013?
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:32:01
I don't think he is a scumbag.  I think he is a true believer with good intentions, but is just wrong in terms of his understanding of the technology.
@_date: 2015-08-07 01:20:35
That's pretty big 
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:03:28
Great work!  I've shared the link on Twitter.  I hope others share his work as well.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:45:31
Get your mind around the technology first.  Only then should you invest.  Personally I have vast majority in BTC.  A tiny bit in ETH and LTC.
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:02:42
No, it is not too late.
@_date: 2015-07-06 06:46:47
There are much better groups to donate money to than ones promoting crackpot conspiracy theories such as We Are Change...
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:16:58
I thought this was sarcastic haha. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:47:05
Well, taxation is theft, so good job on the corporations for avoiding them. L
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:55:13
I have been investing every few weeks for years. Just dollar cost average. It isn’t too late, we are very early on the adoption s curve.

This is great!
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:27:36
Great recap here
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:19:27
And now he calls us Cripplecoin.  Nice...
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:00:42
Never in my wildest dreams when I heard about this in 2011 did I think this would go to $9,000!
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:26:11
In my opinion, yes. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:55:21
Sounds like you have an unhealthy relationship.  How can you hide something like this from your wife?  I even tell my girlfriend how much BTC I own.  Sounds like there are much deeper issues here...
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:24:18
Yes, use purse.io to get over 20% of at Amazon or shop at one of the many merchants that accept. Very important. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:31:46

Andreas lives off of bitcoin so has been spending it all along. Likely not a millionaire as a result. He could have just held, but he spends which is extremely admirable.

@_date: 2013-04-04 00:15:53
Exactly - 
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:46:42
You act as if the government is fair and rational.  In their eyes every single person would be a criminal.

Exactly. They are a completely lawless, criminal organization. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:06:33

"WAS IT READ WHEN YOU GOT TO IT?" - I apologize if I didn't communicate this well.  There are no unread text messages that I have in my phone.  Thus, it must have been read at some point before today (when I first recall viewing the text message).  So there are two possibilities.  1.  I read it at the time but do not recall doing so.  2. Somebody else read it.
One more thing to bring up.  When searching through past emails, I noticed that when I signed up there I sent myself an email (Gmail) with my blockchain account name, a mneumonic, password, and address.  I'm guessing this is retarded and about the worst thing I could have done.  Could this be what did it?  If so, how does that explain the SMS phone text?

Yep, I no longer freak out at price drops.  I'm confident in the long-term value of bitcoin and will not be selling for many years, just using for purchases and buying more.
@_date: 2013-08-07 08:29:05
Is it possible I myself accidentally transferred the money somewhere?
Unless I'm mistaken, I was alone in my room at the time.  I had surgery that day and was not moving from my bed due to pain/painkillers.
My roommates would have access to my phone if they came into my room when I was sleeping (otherwise I almost always have it on me), though I'm a VERY light sleeper.  I'll definitely ask them about what they were doing at the time, but only one of them know anything about Bitcoin or even tech, and he'd be the least likely person to steal it.
It is an iPhone 4s.  I've got Vuze which I use for torrents.

Bernanke is dead wrong on everything regarding economics, so I see this as a huge plus.

But if they didn't use the encrypted wallet file and just used my username, password, secret pass phrase, and wallet address which I stupidly emailed to myself, could they log onto Blockchain instead and complete the transfer (thus triggering the SMS text)?  
I'm sorry if this has already been answered. I may not have understood. Thanks.

Great, thanks.  I'll be calling them today to attempt to get that information.

They seem to wait until way after an event has unfolded to released a statement. They should have released this immediately.
Additionally, there is no reason in hell they shouldn't have had a minimum order instituted long ago. That isn't rocket science...

It gets better with time.  I had 40 btc stolen from my Blockchain wallet that I bout for ~$30 on average (  
I've tried to take it as a lesson in online security and am now being much more careful with the bitcoins I've got now.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:04:22
Yes, bitcoin has the potential to completely demolish government control.  Governments currently control the money which allows them to have significant power over the population.  Things like waging large scale war would be incredibly more difficult without control of the money.

 We have! It's not something we're actively looking to implement but we're definitely open to the idea of it for the future.

Lol, nothing to fear.  Everybody who runs a business should fear the government.  They frequently use force to interfere with your business, fine you, or jail you.
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:22:34
As they began to buy up coins, the price would skyrocket.  They would never be able to buy up "all" of them.  Once they got deep into the market, people would start selling their bitcoins for astronomical amounts because of the scarce supply of available bitcoins.
So, it would be incredibly expensive and nearly impossible to execute something like that.

Yes, I pay off the gang. I don't want to be caged for not paying or murdered if I resist their theft of my property.  I do not wish to fund their terrible, murderous regime, but I'll be the one they kill if I didn't comply with their demands.

Yes, I did click on them, but I'm sorry, I don't know how to check what my current IP address is.
On July 30th, I was logged in from a Starbucks on the hospital's WiFi which I can see on the map.  Besides that, the location on the map appears to be where my apartment is and have the same IP address (the first 11 characters are the same, but then they change - I don't understand what that means).
I do not have 2-factor for Gmail, but I'll do that now and change all my passwords to something much more robust.
I checked my laptop browser history, and I do not see any activity during the time of the transfer.  However, it looks like there is a gap in my history where I or somebody else cleared the history on my computer.  8/1 12pm to 8/2 11am is missing.  The transfer happened at 12:20am on 8/2.
I did not find anything on my phone's browser history during that time either.
Could the fact that I emailed all that sensitive account and password information to myself have been accessed at some point in the past and then acted on later?  With the mnemonic information, would it be possible to access my funds even without physical possession of my phone?  If that were the case, they could have transferred everything out, and the SMS that Blockchain sent me wouldn't have mattered.

A random Bitpay investor - 
@_date: 2013-08-07 08:23:40
First of all, thank you for helping with this.  Here are my answers to your questions.
I import the private key into blockchain.info.
Could you explain how the private key could get stored in an email?  I'm not even sure how to locate it.  I was once sent an email from Blockchain with a wallet backup saying the following, but that is all I'm aware of - "Attached to this email is an AES encrypted wallet backup which contains everything you need to restore your bitcoin balance. You can use it to restore the wallet at anytime at My Wallet or using the 3rd party MultiBit Desktop client."
I don't believe anybody could have borrowed my phone at that time.  I was at home for a few days in my apartment because of a surgery.  I may have turned on my wifi once (though I don't think so) if that could do something.
My password could probably be stronger, but it is one of the stronger ones I use.  5 letters and 6 numbers.  I don't believe I use it anywhere else.
The time between the two is 3 minutes.  12:17am the code was sent.  12:20am, the was the transaction that emptied the wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:12:11
I hope they double down after this crash.  Would be nice to at least get this thing back up a bit to save face and get everything back on the right track.
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:56:54
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. Important to know the exact mechanics of this. 
@_date: 2013-08-07 10:39:27
I only had two factor authentication enabled on my phone, not on my Gmail where there was an email from Blockchain with my encrypted wallet.  
If this matters, I only enabled two factor authentication on Blockchain within the last few months, after this email would have been sent.

The U.S. government does whatever it wants throughout the entire world.  Borders do not stop their violence.
@_date: 2013-05-15 05:14:59
It has nothing to do with that. It has to do with them wanting to crush alternative currencies. Their money system is what gives them their real power, and without it they would have nowhere near the power today,
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:33:32
The government can do whatever they want.  Look at what they've done historically.  They never follow their own laws.
I'd expect the price to drop, but I think because of the ability to remain virtually anonymous, I think people would still use them under the table.

"We've won the state's war on drugs..."
Tell that to the innocent victims of the 40,000 yearly drug raids which often result in destruction of property, theft, murder/assault, and the killing of pets.  Also the nearly 2 million people arrested on drug charges every year. 
Bitcoin is certainly helping the situation (besides helpfulness in tax evasion this is one of the reasons I most like bitcoin), but the violent, criminal gang known as the "government" will stop at nothing to continue their war on peaceful people and their families.

Gyft is the best way to do this. I turn my btc into money at Amazon which is basically as good as cash to me since I buy everything there.  I've done this with hundreds of dollars, an I never see the need to sell btc.

They can ban bitcoins in the same manner they ban a plant like marijuana.  Criminalize buying/selling it, holding it, and using it.  While it would be more difficult for them to control than marijuana, they can still dramatically impact the market by increasing the risks of doing anything bitcoin related.

So sad to see this hero kidnapped by the criminal organization calling itself "government."

The actual amount of coins doesn't really matter in my opinion so long as there are a sufficient number to function (you couldn't have 100 non-divisible coins).  The market will adjust to the outstanding number of coins so if there were twice as many bitcoins, I'd expect the price to be about half as much.  
However, you wouldn't want inflation that is too high.  Something like bitcoin that gets inflated at a decreasing rate and eventually stops works well.
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:36:52
That will NEVER happen.
"To explore this more fully, let's say every person on earth generates a million new addresses every millisecond. Then it would take 6.6 billion billion millenia (that's right, a billion times a billion times a thousand years) to run out. It would take 600 trillion millenia before you had a 0.01% chance of generating a duplicate address.
It would take something like 4 trillion years before any one of the 2.5 billion billion addresses you'd generate in your lifetime had a 0.01% chance of being a duplicate." - omnilynx

Not paying taxes requires a lot more than a moderate amount of testicles.  Taxation is ultimately a threat of murder.  If you do not comply with being robbed, and resist in any manner when they try to drag you away to a cage, you will be murdered.
Most people prefer to give their money to the criminals as opposed to let themselves be murdered.

Let's hope people start using it this way. If bitcoin can help lots of people from being robbed, it would be incredible.

You seem to believe that evidence is needed to convict somebody of a crime in the U.S.  That has not been the case for quite some time.

Probably not, and obviously "banning" bitcoins cannot stop people from using them.  However, it will likely decrease their value.

They cannot ban bitcoin because it is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network but they can ban absolutely anything else they want in terms of merchants, exchanges, buying/holding/selling, etc.

Thank you for this suggestion.  I'm honestly not trying to be difficult and I apologize if I'm coming off that way.  While this isn't going to bankrupt me by any means, this is a pretty decent chunk of change to me.  Even if I don't get it back, I'd like to use this as a learning experience so I don't make the same mistake again.  I'm a bitcoin enthusiast, and I want to know how to use it securely.
The only dates I see for this are in July (not the August 2nd date).  July 11th (twice), 16th, 18th, 29, 30th.

The government taking your money (at the point of a gun if necessary) whether you consent or not isn't theft?
If I came to your house, robbed you, but then did some good things with the money such as donating to charity, that is still theft.

Yes. Unfortunately many here do not understand that the government is the most violent criminal organization in the world.  They have not studied in detail their past abuses to the human rights of individuals who have harmed nobody.
If you are heavily involved in bitcoin, particularly in a bitcoin related business, you need to accept the possibility that you may end up spending the rest of your life in a cage.

How could I determine this? Thanks. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:32:08
Please master, can we just get you're approval!

The U.S. government has control over anything they want.  They do not care about borders or rule of law. This should not be a surprise to anyone who has been paying attention. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 13:04:22
This is hilarious. I love it. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:52:00
Nice buy man.
@_date: 2013-06-29 15:23:50
Couldn't agree more. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:04:27
Looks like they responded. I tweeted at them as well. 
@_date: 2013-05-20 10:19:04
I used Gyft to buy a $100 Amazon card. It was fast and easy as well. I do most of my shopping there, so I'll be using this process for all my future orders.
@_date: 2013-08-06 05:35:00
Effectively 0.
@_date: 2013-08-07 09:14:50
You reminded me to check where else I used that password.  It looks like I used the same one for Coinbase as well, but just those 2 locations.
Besides the fact that my roommates are people I trust a lot, frankly they are both millionaires and I do not think they would steal the money unless they just get jollies from stealing.  The reason I'm not pointing the finger at them is that I just think it is unlikely that they did so.  I'm assuming I really messed something up given my complete lack of tech understanding.

Sad to see the criminal gang in Washington use violence to stop yet another business. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:56:59
Everybody please retweet that!
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:45:23
Just bought a bit more.  Not sure if we'll see sub $800 again anytime soon.
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:03:41
Just 2 days left to raise the remaining $2,000.  Spread the word.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:57:47
Because there is no time value of money?
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:35:30
Share this on Facebook.  A lot of others will share and this will really spread.
@_date: 2013-12-29 23:25:53
Have you been paying attention. The U.S. government (and any government for that matter) has never and will never follow their own laws.
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:22:33
Damn, beat me to it.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:48:17
I had emailed myself all the information, including my password, for my Blockchain wallet.  Additionally, there was the wallet backup that Blockchain sends out.
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:15:59
Trust the U.S. government, haha.  There is no entity on the face of this earth that is less trustworthy than the criminal gang in Washington.
@_date: 2013-04-05 07:04:33
Good luck man. This will be a really incredible story if you can find them.
@_date: 2013-08-13 04:16:16
Yep, very frequently raided and robbed.
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:36:27
I'm not 100% certain. I had stupidly emailed myself my password information. Also in my email was a wallet backup that Blockchain sent out. I think they were able to just use that somehow. 
I recieved a text for the Blockchain 2FA, but I guess they didn't need it. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:36:11
This is great, but people in the community need to think about how we can prevent mining pools from even getting close to that level in the future.  We can't always count on benevolent actors.
@_date: 2013-06-16 15:36:12
I spend my bitcoins on Amazon using gift cards purchased through Gyft.
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:59:27
This is the funniest thing I've read on @_date: 2013-08-03 05:36:51
Awesome!  Such a great organization to support.
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:08:07
Thanks, I corrected it.
@_date: 2013-10-08 13:22:11
Ugh, so sad to see all these peaceful people getting caught up in the violence perpetrated by this criminal organization.  I wish all those heroes the best as they attempt to free themselves from their kidnappers.
@_date: 2013-06-06 03:39:20
It's no surprise that the state wants to steal your money in any way possible.
@_date: 2013-08-07 11:18:05
One more question, as the attacker was doing this process, would something be triggered at Blockchain that would send me an SMS text?  I'm just trying to understand how that would fit into this process. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:27:16
Man, sould have bought this morning. Hopefully it cools down and we just get a steady rise. Bitcoin lives!
@_date: 2013-10-03 05:12:20
This whole thing makes my blood boil. I just can't understand how any reasonable human being could not support the complete legalization of all drugs.
@_date: 2013-04-07 14:29:41
I love these types of videos from Stefan.
@_date: 2013-10-15 04:55:08
I sure hope so. I'd love to see this destructive and murderous regime fall.
@_date: 2013-12-22 17:21:30
Then the current bitcoin holders become rich.
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:46:00
I purchase the majority of my food from Whole Foods using Bitcoin (through Gyft).  I love it.
I keep my BTC reserves stable as I buy bitcoin and then use it directly to buy gift cards.  Then, over time, I add a bit to my holdings.
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:21:12
True, but Bill is on a whole different level.
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:59:49
Great, so how bout you finance these things yourself and not hold a gun to my head to fund these government programs that I find to be incredibly destructive and harmful to the poor?
@_date: 2013-12-31 05:29:25
Excellent idea.  I'd love to see something like this implemented.
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:37:00
The U.S. government is the largest terrorist organization on the planet...
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:54:13
Gotta love terrorists like Senator Kirk trying to claim something may be used for terrorism.
@_date: 2013-08-07 08:50:03
To your additional questions - I did not use a brainwallet with a phrase.  My password is probably shitty.  It is 5 letters and 6 numbers that are not random.
To your question about the phone text.  Unfortunately, I don't have a clear answer here as I honestly do not remember seeing this text until right now (5 days later).  I was quite out of it that day.  I had a surgery for which I was put under, 10 hours earlier in the day and was basically a zombie.  I do not recall seeing the message at the time, either when it was sent, or after the fact, but it is possible that I did see the message that day but didn't think much of it (again, I was very out of it).
I honestly do not think that my roommates would even know how to steal my money.  I will confront them about it, but I'd bet my life savings that none of them did so.  I think I somehow fucked up in some way, so I'm trying to figure out how I may have done that.
@_date: 2013-06-24 03:00:43
If you've been observing the actions of government over the years, it doesn't take much foresight.  Satoshi was likely well aware of what the violent, criminal gang would do to him. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:52:26
Awesome!  I hope more people start doing this.
