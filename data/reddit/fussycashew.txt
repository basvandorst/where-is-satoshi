It's basically a reversed-roles situation in which you spend mostly bitcoin and have your debit card as a means to pay USD if necessary. Definitely a fantasy that won't be reality for a long time if ever. Bitcoin's real strength is in international commerce.

It would be interesting to see banks allow you to convert money in your account to BTC and then manage a BTC wallet for you. 
In a really interesting reality they could let your wealth be in BTC and converted to USD during transactions with your debit card. Of course with the volatility of today, this would not be something a bank would like doing, and it's not something someone should do, as it's quite easy to lose a lot of USD very fast.

That sounds about right, you'd probably use a bit more considering you've also got the rest of your system running. According to the specs you've got a max of 225W. I'd say if you **under**clocked your RAM a lot, and overclocked your GPU a bit, you could get your total wattage around 180-200, but I'm no expert on hardware in that aspect. I think your first goal would be to maximize GPU speeds while minimizing temp. Mining doesn't use your card's RAM, so if you clock it down, then you'll have more space as far as temperature to play with the GPU clock speeds. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 11:03:19
Litecoins mine on the RAM of your GPU, and thus can't be mined on the current Bitcoin-targeted ASIC units.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think anyone is going to loan bitcoins, plus I don't think it's a good idea for bitocin as a whole. Credit is what destroys economies IMO. That being said, there's no way for the people loaning bitcoins to ensure that the person whom they are loaning them to will ever pay back, as they are not regulated by any government. From the government's standpoint, that'd be like saying "I loaned him 300 gold in Runescape and he never payed back!"

You can still buy bitcoin for $1000 and then move it to your wallet, and there are people buying bitcoin for $1000. Therefore they value it at $1000.

[Here's a picture]( of my setup.
As you can see, I'm currently at 940 MHz on the GPU, and 1100 on the RAM. The fan's at 85%, and I'm mainting 74C. I'm getting just under 200 MH/s, with 970 on the GPU I got a little over, but then the system locked up. :P
As far as my pool, I'm currently using [Bit Minter]( which has a fairly decent payout time and fair payout distribution. What's also cool about their pool is that it has it's own mining software. You can use others, but in my case I had many issues getting pheonix and cgminer working (they both crashed when they started mining), so I went with theirs, and it's really nice. The only downside is that I'm locked to their pool with it.
I'm not too experienced with underclocking (I'd not have thought you'd need to do it until I started mining haha), and frankly I'm afraid to drop the memory any lower. Do you think I could get it down to around 800-900? Dropping from 1200 has caused a very noticeable temperature reduction, as I was previously running at 78-80C with GPU clocks at 910 MHz.

I was afraid there would be a crash, even thought about putting in orders to sell on multiple occasions, but in the end I just closed my laptop, and went on with my day.

One way to calculate electrical costs is by purchasing a Kill-A-Watt, or by using [this]( chart for getting a rough estimate. The bitminter pool couldn't be easier.

Previously the computer had been running 24/7 as a media server, and I'm not too concerned with energy costs. I know that running  GPU at 100% 24/7 is a much higher energy cost than the computer just idling or playing a video. To solve this, I've underclocked the RAM on my graphics card down to about as low as I feel safe having it run (from 1200 to 900 Mhz), while I lose visual performance, I've dropped around 12C on the card temp, and that was with the GPU OCd 120 Mhz above it's normal clock. So it is more than I was previously using, but less than it would be. Also, this is more of an experiment to get my feet wet in mining. 
I'm planning on purchasing an ASIC Miner from ButterflyLabs soon, probably the [BitForce Jalapeno]( and that runs at 4.5 Watts while giving 4.5 GH/s as well.

Ah the old "post on reddit and actually get customer support" trick. You couldn't reply to my email or pick up the phone, but I go posting online and you're all the sudden there. I still have no trust for you whatsoever. Why isn't your support email on your website (as of when I checked it earlier this afternoon)? Why does your phone line not allow for voice mails, or even tell you what extension to enter to get in touch with anyone? Why isn't there an email being sent out to all of your users informing them of the issues?
And through all of this you're staying right on top of your IPO post on bitcointalk. Because you gotta make sure those investors are well taken care of, right?
Edit: This may be reaching a little too far, but I think you're lying about "hundreds of orders" too. My order number was 100000051, if I didn't know better, I'd think you've handled 100,000,051 orders, but more likely, you've handled 51 and are appending 100000000 to all of the order numbers.

Oh I have been watching, but I don't want to trust just the opinions of a few. I was curious as to what others have to say, as we all think for ourselves.

I think the whole process cost me 3%
It's excessively convenient. I printed out the form, went to a local drug store, answered some questions with a MoneyGram rep on the phone in the store, and then paid the cashier. It took about 15 minutes and within the hour the money was in my MtGox account.

Did you make money? If the answer is yes then you shouldn't be worrying. You can't linger on potential profit, but real profit. I sold my "play money" at $300 and I don't regret it at all. I also slowly spent about half of my stash engaging in bitcoin commerce, and although most of those purchases are now worth way more than the items/services I received in return, I still got not only my initial investment out, but I also made a profit.

That's the plan I'm formulating now. It kinda sucks to get into this mining deal just in time to be completely outpaced by this new technology.

You don't think? I figured if I keep running in the pool I am (and assuming the current H/s rates stay the same within the pool) I'd be making a lot more per day than I am now. My math is probably flawed, but I figured it would be around $10 or so a day. 
Edit: After reading [this]( article, I do see how my logic is flawed. In fact, it looks like I'll just continue making around the same I do now because of the leap in computational power across the network.

Huh, I just bought bitcoin through BitInstant, and I used ZipZap and a MoneyGram bill payment. I guess you guys are doing the same thing? One thing about BitInstant is I can credit my MtGox account, and from there buy bitcoins when the price is lower.
One problem I have with ZIGGAP is that you must register, where BitInstant is completely anonymous. 
Not trying to deface your company, I love seeing new startups, but if you want to compete with BitInstant, you'll need to improve.
Also: CVS not CSV, and you've got some misinformation, there may be a Red Phone instead of Blue Form if you go to some branches. They have a Red Phone at my local CVS.

It'd take a lot of determination to compromise CloudFare. In the case they are compromised, all it takes is to manually change your DNS information and point back to your host's nameservers.
