You don't get it, if you want bitcoin to come out of the shadows and become more then a way to buy drugs on silk3.0 then some rules will be needed. This is a big one so big fuck*** bank does not send  bitcoin  back to druglords favorite payment method.

When the price on a exchange goes from $530-$451 in a matter of minutes I would say it's manipulations. 
You can call it what ever you want, real markets don't behave this way. When an exchange has algorithms that closes positions and people figure out how to tricger this algo to cause a selling cascade. 
I would say MANIPULATION,  you can call quarks or what ever.  I just hope Bifinex is not in collusion with the perpetrators.

You're right about the drugs and dollars, but you still don't understand my bigger point. If naked short selling is allowed our bitcoins will be worth just as much as any other altcoin when the banks and hedgefunds get a hold of them. Bitcoin is a treat to wallstreet and some will not go down without a fight. They will try to find ways to undermine bitcoin and this is one of them.

This may explain some of this withdraw.  
apparently they saw that the MSC people maxed out leaving very little for the BTC sale. They used a MSC loan to purchase the remaining SAFE for the BTC straggler who where still sleeping in.

If they allow loopholes like this, big players could literally drive bitcoin to the ground and possibly kill it. let's make sure Lawsky and NY doe not allow this and is included in the new regulations.

funny how now everyone is selling bitcoin as a transacting protocol rather then all of the above. Cuban is just promoting his texting app hopping to cash in on the snappchat craze. Just wait for big bank to start calling bitcoin a transacting protocol and they want their peace of it.

Let the squeeze begin. The first sings of bitcoin scarcity. Sorry coinbase I like to earn interest on my bitcoins. How could anyone dismiss a 20+% APR for lending bitcoin. Not even credit card companies.

That's why you never short on a up trend.

Here have 1000 bits calm the f**k down you're going to get a hearattack before you see bitcoin solve some real world problems.

what is good exchange to use, Gox prices seem to be very inflated compare to the others which stay close to each other.

I'm not sure if this is legit. Their predictions don't make much sense. Just look at their 5 day and 20 day prediction charts, they are way off. If this was based on historical performance data they would not be so far apart. They is not info on how their neural network predicts(works).

Wait, government cronies doing their job.  Someone must have told them to get on them crypto hedonist. They should look at how much their parents 401K lost in the financial crisis and see if they could have done anything about that.

People will go nuts over this, changetip will bring bitcoin to the masses if nothing else will. $.2

It was only a matter of time before they  figure where the other exchanges cascade initiation triggers are. They question is who is behind it all. Lets hope this will teach leverage trader that bitcoin is not the ideal free market some people claim it to be but rift with collusion and maleficence.  
Remember Gox,
always trade with caution and cover your ass, specially with BTC
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:40:15
how cool is this, people are going to go crazy with their tipping, $.20
