Its not ignorant to any fact, its your opinion that economies can only function with inflationary currencies. I really don't agree here at all. Look at economic growth during the time we still had the USD gold standard. Inflation and FIAT money printing is just a hidden tax on those who are at the lowest end of the money supply flow and we spend the money of the next generation by sending governments into trillion of USD in debt. All this inflation is just provoking asset bubbles such as Realestate and private equity ultimately pricing people out who aren't on the ride of ownership. And here is a finalising quote, food for thought:
“Let me issue and control a nation’s money and I care not who writes the laws.”
Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744–1812), founder of the House of Rothschild.
With Bitcoin, the people issue and control the nation’s money.
Oh and do you realise the federal reserve is privately owned?

I'd wonder how that graph would look like if you'd adjusted it according to the M2 money stock supply which has increased some 100x in that same time period. Inflation adjusted GDP doesn't account for the inflation in realestate which has been by far impacted the most.

I don't think monetary data can be stupid and ignorant towards something. Data just "is". Or are you the type of people to use words such as "Hate Facts"?

Keynesian economics is the greatest scam in human financial history.

Mining centralisation at its finest, this isn't really that good.
