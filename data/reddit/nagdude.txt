It is voluntary to implement Segwit. It was always sold as such. Bitcoin should be able to scale with or without it. Some people like Coke, some Pepsi. It is IS level shit to force everyone to drink Coke because it would reduce the price if they had a monopoly.
As a long longtime hodler it is insane to see the companies that helped to build, market and facilitate for the bitcoin boom being shunned because of Segwit. Get real, 640kb is not enough for everyone.

Pizza place needs to run or be connected to a LN hub. So do you. And you need to deposit funds to the LN hub you are using. And there needs to be a route / connection between these two hubs through other hubs. So it kind of works like banks. You have an account with Bank of America LN hub which you have deposited money to. The Pizza place have an account with Chase Manhattan hub. When you pay the LN works like Visa or MasterCard - they make sure that the money flows from your account in Bank of America hub to the Pizza place account in Chase Manhattan using as few intermediaries as possible.
Not being negative here, because LN seems pretty cool for certain applications. But it's so far away from being wildly deployed and accepted that I find today's LN news premature euphoria.

Coercion is how segwit was born. Now it looks like coercion is how it will be forcefed parties in the eco system too.
Strange how censorship free money needs to resort to such measures. How about letting people voluntarily chose what and what not to use? Some people like coke, some people like Pepsi. It's kind of crazy to state that if just EVERYONE used Pepsi it would be cheaper - which is why coke should be banned. Not free market. Not voluntarism. Not freedom.
Bitcoin should be able to scale through multiple methods / techniques competing with each other through features and fees. What's happing now is ISIS level shit.

If the coins are in my account there is a smaller chance for an "and it's gone" moment than if they are "allocated to a shared channel using multisig". Fuck, I've been in on this journey since 2010. I have rarely encountered concepts that are difficult to understand and explain to others. Bitcoin is _simple_. But this Lightning "improvement"... Ill just quickly pop over to my dad (which own Bitcoin and can barely use his Ledger) and explain to him how to do a transaction by locking up coins through multisig allocating them to a shared channel. Adoption for Bitcoin has been constantly increasing because of "fairly" ease of use. Not any more.

technically Bitcoin has went (quite) a few steps a way from the whitepaper. BCH is in reality much closer to the origins, the vision that on-boarded a heck of a lot people early on. I have no problem seeing why it has so much appeal. I suspect that still most proper hodlers are still sitting with their feet in both camps. When the permahodlers decide to go all in on one side is the time when this battle will be ended.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:12:42
I don't think you have any idea how far away LN is. Segwit adoption is running at sub 10% of all transactions. Usually new tech is adopted ultra fast in the crypto world, but segwit has in large part been rejected by the market. LN is a hell of a lot more complicated than segwit. Even if LN was production ready today it would take years for the ecosystem to develop and trust to be built. I would _never_ send my coins, even a small portion of them, to be stored at a hub. It feels completely crazy after all these years of "if you don't own your keys you don't own your Bitcoin" that the scaling solution turns into "give us your coins and your keys".
IF LN turns out to be the real McCoy it's at least going to take 2-3 years for any kind of mass adoption.

We obviously perceive the world through different facets. But I hope you hold both tokens for the same reason as me: Even though I'm pretty sure i'm right i have to entertain the possibility that I'm wrong. And if I'm wrong the other token is the hedge.
Just the notion that you think you might be wrong puts you squarely outside of the acolyte box. I'm completely pragmatic about the entire issue so please dont brand me as a "rbtc'rs"
My biggest issue is that i _no_ faith in this Lightning Network. Out of this world over engineered, impossible to understand completely. I have no faith in mass adoption though Lightning. Lightning seems to be the epitome of what Nassim Taleb's calls 'Fragile'. The original Bitcoin is the exact opposite - incredibly Antifragile.

How can it possibly be the case that the hash power of Bitcoin Cash is more centralized than Bitcoin? It is literally exactly the same miners(!) that allocate hash power based on price. If this was not the case there would not be close to a 1:1 relationship to the hash rate and price ratio between the two.
Also, miner centralization is obviously less of an issue as long as there is no way to prohibit new miners from competing. 


Do you have anything to back up this value judgement with? I would say that with stakes this high it would be appropriate to stay away from touchy feely and stick to facts. If the qualifications were so questionable they would surely have made some grave mistakes by now?  


How so? From the very get go it was always going to be multiple chains competing for the longest chain and the title. This is just a competing chain doing exactly that. Sharing the same history, same code and same people. _Minor_ tweaks set them apart, but the tweaks are political in nature, which is why its healthy for the market to decide which one to follow. History has shown time and time again that the free marked will win no matter how unpalatable the outcome is.   
@_date: 2014-08-15 11:10:03
No, if you have 9k bitcoins to sell and you press the sell button that's it. Not everyone goes around considering what this would to do the price. Not everyone is speculating. Some people are selling to sell and not to speculate. When i sell i have a dollar goal to purchase something, I do it in chunks because its difficult to gauge exactly what the resulting USD value would be from a sale. But i never stop selling because the price goes down a few bucks, i continue until i have reaced my goal. I have probably wasted a few bitcoin by this practice but i'm sure im not alone in this way of selling.

Bitcoin has intent, and its fingerprints are all over, you have to be daft not to see it.
Why on earth did you think Satoshi minted the first block with the seed: "Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"!? Of every possible choice he had to pick a seed from he specifically chose one that captured the entire essence of contemporary Central Bank folly. Satoshi could not possibly have been more blunt about the political and ideological intent of his invention.
For _everyone_ with political leanings towards liberty Bitcoin screams at you that it is the personification of what sound money should be like. If you google Bitcoin in combination with words like liberty, libertarian, liberalism, capitalism, anarcho-capitalism etc you will get millions, tens of millions of hits. Try doing the same adding keywords like marxism, communism, socialism. Strangely enough there are very few hits and the hits you get is that Bitcoin will be their end. Bitcoin is _incredibly_ political and ideologically oriented, its intent is to change the political landscape of the entire planet.
Every central banker in the world shuns it and they have issued hundreds of warnings for people to 'stay away' from bitcoin. Do you seriously think all of this is just a technological coincidence?
Bitcoin was forged after all previous attempts to create a free competing currency failed. Literally every parameter has been designed to circumvent the mechanisms that had landed founders of prior attempts of free marked currencies in jail, eg e-gold or liberty dollar.
Just reading the very first sentence in the white paper:
"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution"
Satoshi specifically points out that 'financial institutions' are _out_, they are going to become redundant. Its kind if impossible to reach any other conclusion (considering the genesis seed) that 'financial institution' literally means 'Central Bank accredited Banks'. And just using the word 'cash' here, in a paper describing an electronic currency, is definitely meant to trigger associations like: untraceable and anonymous. Its a frontal attack on the established financial system in every sense.
All of this is not 'arbitrary lines', its the origin on Bitcoin and the words/variables Satoshi used determined what people caught interest early on.
And this ideological belief is still strong, just listen to any number of people revolving around Bitcoin who's podcasts are regularly voted to the top, like: Jeffrey Tucker, Stefan Molyneux, Richard Falkvinge etc. There are _many_ more.
It is exactly this belief that is the reason why hundreds of thousands of miners ended up being pointed at Bitcoin Cash _at a loss_ after the split. The idea was more important than the money. And the idea is _exactly_ as Satohis first sentence in the whitepaper: The transactions should be _peer to peer_. Lightning requires hubs, read "financial institutions", to function.
You are free to perceive the world though your of facet / prism. But its fucking smart to be able to have a multitude of prisms in your bag so you can put them on and perceive the world how other people perceives it. You dont have to agree, but when you say that its crap that Satoshi did't have a vision you have to understand that there are hundreds of thousands of people who disagree. They get out of bed every morning making economic choices in the crypto sphere based on this belief. This is why Bitcoin Cash will prosper as long as Bitcoin is in the ideological desert it's currently in. This is why people will mine it at a loss. And when people have that kind of determination, within any field, its smart to pay attention.

Bitmain did not "pre-mine" Bitcoin Cash at all. After the fork they allocated hash power to the Bitcoin Cash fork - which was open and free for anyone to do, it was not a private "pre-mine". This is not pre-mining in any sense of the word and it is deceitful to brand it as such. The correct way to think about it is that Bitcoin was headed _politically_ in a direction Bitmain did not like and they used their economic freedom to support a fork that was more palatable for them. This is the freedom _every_ participant in bitcoin has, have had in the past and should have in the future. We cannot let priests, mullas or rabbies telling us what is right and wrong. Voting is done with hash power.


This ASIC boost is just a big fuzz about nothing. Has it _ever_ been documented that it has actually been used? Outside of a test environment? Even Slush pool supports Asicboost.
 &gt; But the point is that Bcash miners are mostly part of the Bitmain cartel
I see the same names in the hash rate distribution for both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Again, if it wasn't exactly the same miners allocating hash rate based on price it is _impossible_ that the hash rate could track the price ratio so closely at 1:1.
And even if, at the time of writing, Bitmain should directly and indirectly control a larger share of hash power than other, so what? Its completely free for anyone to compete with them, they are even selling the hardware to compete with them. If Bitcoin Cash gains in popularity more and more people will mine it reducing the dominance of Bitmain. 


Obviously not true. They may be stonewalling technical progress which _you_ like and they don't. That is the right of every individual and organisation. Bitmain has been a driving force in hardware development and seed money to dozens / hundreds of startups. They have done _much_ more for bitcoin than most and have been a pioneer helping to spread economic freedom.


"every single" is not true. Just a lot of them. And that nodes crash does not cause loss of funds. I was around when Bitcoin had to roll back when someone managed to conjure billions of Bitcoin into existence. Should we just toss the entire development team for Bitcoin away too?
If this was such a grave incidence confidence would have been completely lost. As it turns out confidence was not lost, and has grown ever since and more of the original Bitcoin crew has joined.


Me thinks that there are noe "press briefings". Bitcoin Cash is akin to Bitcoin in that noone and everyone can speak on its behalf. Why don't I just issue a "press briefing" that Bitcoin and everyone associated with it are Marxists? And then slam you with the "fact" that you are a Marxist? This is not revisionist history - Its in the original whitepaper explicitly describing the mechanism how to determine what is Bitcoin. Bitcoin just took some _political_ choices with tech and people that was so far away from a large part of the participants that something had to be done to satisfy Mr. Market.


Mr. Market disagrees with you. Currently there is around 30.000.000 TH on the Bitcoin chain and 5.250.000 TH on Bitcoin Cash. This translates into a staggering 2.1 Million S9 miners on the Bitcoin chain and around 18% as many, 375.000 at Bitcoin Cash chain. 375.000 miners is not a delusion. That many miners is an _enormous_ investment and commitment to have dedicated on Bitcoin Cash. For most the people who owns those 375.000 miners its about ideology. They belive in economic freedom, capitalism, liberty, that transactions should be affordable by all, and accessible through the simple and proven interface of the blockchain. Do you know why miners mine Bitcoin? Because its profitable. As soon as its more profitable to mine anything else, they switch. In other words, its not about ideology.  That is why the Bitcoin Cash chain didn't die off at the first sign of trouble and which is why it will prevail.


Me personally hodl both. As it was anticipated in the white paper there is probably going to be some friction and that hash power should sort it out. Im 100% certain that the chain providing _most economic freedom_ will prevail. I'm pragmatic which chain this will be in the end, so i hedge my bet by hodling all until the dust settles. 


Why should i get lost? Just because for a fraction of Bitcoins existence i'm in disagreement with you? Why don't you get lost for supporting ideals that are diametrically opposed to the intent of Bitcoin? 
The competition that _should_ have happened was that On and Offchain transactions should have competed against each other on the same chain. That would have been civilized and a correct price for on chain transactions should be discovered thus enabling a market for Off chain transactions. Instead a faction hijacked the entire chain using coercion to bypass market mechanisms already established in Bitcoin to sort things like this out. That was not cool dude, and those actions are the only reason the entire community is so divided.

If it was written in stone and consensus that it will "never" happen the price of BCH would be zero. That is not the case. The market prices the probability of a flippening quite much higher than zero. In the time of writing around 17% probability (basically the price ratio between BTC and BCH). However, if the hashrate follows the price, the probability priced in might be substantially higher. No need to flame me, this is what Mr. Market is saying. Any fork of Bitcoin is a contender for the longest chain and the name. This is how it's described in the whitepaper.

I think some people put too much weight on what decentralization means and how important it is. The most important aspect for me is that nobody can be hindered from competing finding blocks. There is a buildt in incentive, no matter the blocksize, to connect to other miners and propagate blocks as fast as possible. This means that if you want to mine every other miner will welcome you and your competition. This ensures _enough_ decentralization in the network. Users / holders have an economic incentive to counter centralization - which they provenly have done many times in the past. From the very get go every node was a mining node. It was only when GPU mining arrived that you got this abomination called a non-mining node. Should have killed of that misconception way back then. Would have saved everybody for a lot of pain and confusion.

LTC will run into exactly the same scaling problems as Bitcoin if people start using it. For the longest time I run my own node. But only until it dawned on me that its an exercise in futility, there is no reason what so ever to run a full node if you don't mine. I've tried to ask this several times but noone can ever explain why running a full non-mining node has any positive effect on the network, I've yet to hear the mechanism explained. It's the miners who writes history, everything else is wishful thinking.

If you only read this sub the case is closed. But it's obviously not that simple. I'm a Bitcoin hodler for 8 years now. But I'm also hodling BCH. All of the old-timers in my circle also hold both. The "liars, criminals and frauds" narritive that is pushed so hard here is not interesting and it really tries to sidetrack the discussion by appealing to personal attacks / guilt by association. BCH, just like BTC, is a honey badger that does not care about individuals revolving around it. It's code that people run voluntarily that matter. If the code is good, safe and has purpose it does not matter if it's Satan himself who wrote it - it's still good. After having seen drama for 8 years now in the community I've become immune to appeals on any level except for code and economic incentive. From this potision BTC looks weak - which is reflected in low marketcap / stagnation in amount of transactions / other alts gain relatively. Lightning is a losing proposition from my standpoint, extremely premature to scale offchain. And megalomaniac not to let on/off chain scaling compete so the market can discover the right ratio between on and off chain transactions. You can't compare Ponzi scheme like Madoff and Bitconnect with BCH. BCH is utilizing the exact same mechanism that BTC did the first 7 years. How can that blockchain possibly become a fraud over night by not changing the code? Does not matter if Ver is a fraud. BCH's blockchain is mined, same rules as in the whitepaper and no coins have been granted to anyone not already owning BTC before the split. If I'm incorrect I would really like to have an explanation what is fraudulent with BCH.

Its already gone from 0.001 to 1200. Going back to 1200 and then 10.000 is not difficult to imagine. If bitcoin is a success 10k would be the minimum. If bitcoin is going to become successful or not is a entirely different question. The biggest challenge in my view is if up-scaling works in all facets of the technology. Just now for example it seems the price is suppressed because of the high cost of miners. 3600 coins/24 hours x 350USD = 1.2 million usd a day just to keep the network going. The cost is too high compared to what the miners are providing. If the price keeps going downwards because of this for a long time we might have to wait until the next halving or even the next after that before the price starts moving again. That is a long way of, people can lose interest and switch to an alternate coin.

I suggest you google AML regulation and ATM regulations for your country to find out exactly how crazy it is. These machines are not expensive, there is a reason why they are not everywhere already. The cost of being in compliance is far more expensive than the machines themselves. If you actually go to the manufacturers of the Bitcoin ATM's they very clearly state that you can buy their machines but _you_ are responsible for being in compliance with local AML and KYC regulations. If you have not hear of this and have not experience with this i suggest you do some thorough googling and reading, it is crippling adoption of new technology in banking and is one of the main reasons everything is so "difficult" with bitcoin where it interfaces with old banking.

But he is not correct. Interest on money is not unnatural and it will happen  with bitcoin too.

Hi Mike.
At the moment i think you are pretty much fucked. Although i feel pretty much alone at the moment i don't think that MTGox is insolvent (they have your coins). But as all the other exchanges they have had some trouble regarding withdrawals because of the attacks happening on the blockchain so its not safe for them to process withdrawals.
MTGox are notoriously bad at communication so don't expext to get any explanation from them until its either fixed or something else happens. Why on earth did you use an exchange as a bank! You bought months ago, you should have withdrawn months ago. Its the first rule of bitcoin - Don't use exchanges as banks! 
@_date: 2014-03-24 12:54:05
There would be no bitcoin if it was like that. An algorithm of distribution that does not disproportionally reward early adopters will result in no early adopters. What would be the point of taking the risk of investing in mining equipment if you can have exactly the same reward _after_ the success is a fact? If KNC are mining and selling continually they are really pushing the price of bitcoin down to its demand level. At least you can know as a speculator that as the mining reward goes down the price is bound to go up. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:55:44
What the hell have you been smoking, bitstamp for one is working just fine, the price is fantastic for a newborn cryptocurrency trading at good volumes around 580 USD.

Step 1. FBI illicitly seize the funds of mtgox and put them on a No-International-Wire transfer shitlist.
Step 2. Mtgox enters slow death spiral and goes belly up because of step 1.
Step 3. FBI launch probe and consequent criminal proceedings.
This is how competition against the establishment is curbed. Crypto currencies can't grow fast enough IMO.

If the differences of bitcoin / altcoins stay the same as now the altcoins will steal some of bitcoins fame. But i don't think that will happen, bitcoin currently have hundreds of individuals working full-time developing advanced add-ons, services, products etc that will be unavailable for the altcoins. The amount of people working on bitcoin projects is growing every day, this is not the case for the altcoins.
This part of bitcoin development have just started after the last price peak so it will take maybe 6-9 months for this to crystallise. You can see this all ready today with a quick search in Github. 2500+ bitcoin projecs, 200+ litecoin projects. This ratio will turn even more sour for the altcoins over time. As long as the altcoins are always one step behind they will lose their appeal. It only takes one single killer app applicable for bitcoin that is not easily recompiled to the alts for them to fail miserably. I suspect it might be related to security, like hardware wallets. If bitcoin can fix this before the altcoins, then the alts will fail.
In addition: Litecoin is really a relic of bitcoin that can only happen once. Once the bitcoiners developed custom hardware to mine bitcoin a lot of the general computing hardware used to mine bitcoin turned redundant. The GPU's could be used to mine _something_, just not bitcoin any longer. So the litecoin got a boost from all the redundant hardware. There will be no more redundant hardware. The Asics when they are not fast enough any longer will be thrown on a pile. This is simple: Litecoin had to change the mining process so that the Asics could not mine litecoins, they could only do this with GPU's because they are general computing units. Any altcoin aiming to use out date bitcoin Asic equipment will, by default, be vulnerable to attacks by the newest bitcoin mining tech. I don't think the bitcoin mining community will always be so gullible towards altcoins. Any plausible competitor based on a tech that is so similar to bitcoin that it can be mined with bitcoin hardware will be crushed in a 51% attack by the bitcoiners. Even the smallest bitcoin pool could crush all the altcoins right now by just dedicating a few minutes of processing capacity destroying their blockchains.

No i dont. Can you see that the price and volume on mtgox is _still_ insane compared to two years ago. Was is _ultra dead_ back then or what? I think you are confusing temporary problems with fatal injury. They are most probably not insolvent, they have earned a shitload of money and coins on trading fees for many years. Just imagine how many coins 0.5% of _all_ transactions there are? We are talking several thousand coins every week, even on days with high volume. You are completely delusional if you think they are insolvent. They have very low overhead and costs to run that operation. Sure the shit hit the fan when their money was locked down by the FBI and they got on the USD transfer shitlist. Sure they hit a wall when the banks blacklisted them from transferring USD. Sure it is bad now when they had to suspend bitcoin withdrawals because of a technical exploit every other exchange also closed because of. Mt Gox have been around for a long time, and they will be so for much longer. It takes a long time to get off the black lists, but when they do they can tell their side of the story and i think everybody will be impressed by the persistence and staying power MT Gox have show. They were the pioneers of bitcoin and deserve more respect.

Bitcoin is like the internet in 1992. It obviously was the alternative to telephone, paper mail, telex, telefax and what not, but it was difficult to use. If you want to be a early adopter on new technology and reap the benefits you have to do some work. Deal with it. If not you can just wait for 5-10 years for this thing to mature - just like the internet - and arrive late at the party but with finished giftwrapped products, security, hardware wallets and what not. With crypto currencies the potential is there, but is a long way to maturity, if you are going to criticise you have to do it from that perspective.

1. Stop trading - right now. You are, based on all historical evidence, horrible at it. You are emotionally driven and that leaves you in an state were you are incapable of making rational choices. If you cannot make rational choices you will lose money.
2. Accept reality. You have lost that money. Accept it and own it, its an inescapable fact. Some people start businesses, burns through all of their savings and fail. Just to learn a lesson. Some people go 4 years on university and end up in huge debts. Just to learn a lesson. You have now learned a lesson about yourself that few others have. It wasn't cheap, but nothing worth while is. It wasn't hobo-making expensive either. To be able to get on with your life you need to take time to reflect on what you have done. Set up mental barriers and shortcuts to prevent this from happening again. If you can learn to cope, handle and feel completely at ease with the feeling you have in your gut right now you can consider trading again after many years, if not - stay away. The way you act a reflect now is what will determine If you will learn and grow from your loss if you will just have lost the money.
I have done what you did multiple times.
Regarding your open position: I think you have to brace yourself for a scenario were bitcon drops to test the previous ATH of 250+- before it turns and that this will not happen in 3-12 months (maybe not until next halving). If you can take that price level without triggering a margin call I'd say you should hold.

Most of this is just rambling and very poorly thought through. For example his suggestion to drop income tax and just let the government print the money they need topping of the money supply. This would not work because the people who actually produce the things government employees want to buy would use a different currency.

In the soviet union, a completely totalitarian an isolated country / economy, the black market thrived. Hard currency and even appliances were used for trade and exchange, even at the peril of exile and long prison sentences. The same is true for North Korea today, there is a growing black market for illegal goods like mobile phones, DVD players, TV's etc. If black / unregulated markets can thrive and survive in such environments up to a level that they are bigger than the white economy (the end of the soviet union) then there is no law or regulation that can be passed at this point that can stop bitcoin. The economic environment today is much more chaotic with much less coordination between countries. Bitcoin will thrive as national currencies will struggle, over time it will become impossible for a government to provide the same degree of security that crypto-currencies will provide.

I don't understand the aggression. Whatever the majority of miners want is what Bitcoin is. Don't like it? Start buying hashing power. I see morons flagging SegWit on their nodes. You can fucking run a node on your Nintendo, who cares. Get busy hashing or shut up.
Mining is what made Bitcoin great. Mining is what pulled in all the early adopters. Mining provides the security. Miners have sunk in hundreds of millions in hardware. Miners make the Bitcoin blockchain untouchable and they can, if they want to, destroy any altcoin using the same algo. This is what makes Bitcoin king. This is why Bitcoin is Bitcoin and everything else a shitcoin. And some retards are angry why the miners haven't jump on command? Either come up with code that the miners will run or start buying hashing to get the majority. Core is retarded not to cooperate with the miners. Since core cannot get any upgrade through without miner approval they have to start realising that the miners are the customers, not some fanboyz at a particular subreddit.
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:59:29
I can see from your attitude its good that you don't get to decide. I can assure you that the network will never stop because of lack of nodes, they are a dime a dozen. There is a reason satoshi weighted this burden on the miners, thats why the reward is placed at the miners as well. He decisions have to be places where there is most risk and interest at stake and that is at the miners. Not the developers or node operators. This sub can bitch and moan like girlscouts all year but until a majority of miners agree nothing will change. I cant believe the attitude is so nonchalant given the situation.

He is putting his money where his mouth is. Bitcoin is like a democracy, you can vote, with hashing power. The people with most vested interest get most votes. Playing the devils advocate her: The core team has 0 hashing power, the miners have invested hundreds of millions of USD in mining power, housing and electricity. What ever happens i think you can be sure that the people mining will not take any rash decisions with their investment. If you dont like the way its going; get busy mining.

Quote from: satoshi on July 29, 2010, 02:00:38 AM
The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.
Sounds very clear to me what he intended to happen. Pools are nothing more than virtual "server farms"
@_date: 2017-03-08 03:36:05
But it's the miners who put up hard cash for the equipment needed to run the network securely. I'm not the expert but it seems the miners would be exactly who decides this. If not for hashpower there is no democratic arena to vote on this. It's too easy / easy manipulative / fluid to count nodes. When the Bitcoin XT row was going on the tables were turned with core yelling and screaming that nodes meant nothing. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:21:51
And just exactly how did you think it would turn out? I've been mining since 2010, im not mining any more. Not for a second did i envision that the future of bitcoin was garage joes (me). I always envisioned just what has happened now, large scale professionalization of the mining process. You cannot run a global currency on a farm of commodore 64's, it has to be massive like it is now. If you don't like that there is a lot of hashing power currently in china then you have to put your money where your mouth is and vote with your money: start hashing. What makes bitcoin great and will continue to make it great is exactly that. You cannot have decisions taken by people not risking anything. the miners have risked everything investing in those hash factories. Its disrespectful to think that they should do what some scriptkids at a reddit forum thinks is best for bitcoin. The miners are extremely conservative, and they should be. Im not convinced that there is a "group that has enough money to control the hash power", but even if this is true they cannot do anything to bitcoin that fudge it without simultaneously killing their biggest investments. So i'm quite certain their rational self interest is thoroughly aligned with mine.
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:03:59

So what is the huge row about then? It seems like both Antpool and f2pools approaches are not unreasonable?
But it does seem like a lot of transactions will eventually go offchain. Disregarding the miners crying over lost transaction fees; having a lot of offchain transactions by third parties surely opens up a can of worms in regard of regulations, tax reporting and law enforcement. A third party that has access to all of these records would be a legal entity in some jurisdiction and prone to pressure. What makes the bitcoin network so attractive today is the lack of any dependencies on third parties to execute transactions.

@_date: 2017-03-08 02:43:35
It's the miners that count, not nodes. I don't understand the focus on nodes. Nodes mean "nothing". The miners are the ones that invested hundreds of millions in hardware and apparently they don't share the enthusiasm.

If his holdings are in bitcoin and your holdings are in bitcoin what could he possible do that hurts you. He is convinced he is doing the right thing and is spending bigtime to achieve his goal. When people do that you should pay close attention. I dont know what is right, either SegWit or BU, but i know that the people who has sunk in hundreds of millions in hardware are not making rash choices.
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:53:33
The wallet connects to neither in a meaningful way. The wallet submits a transaction which is signed by miners and stored by the nodes. Its the signing which is the transaction. The nodes stores the history of transactions.

Can you tell me why miners are so hostile towards SegWit and Lightning? There has to be a rational explanation other than 'roger ver is a retard'

If 75% of miners ends up running BU then i think its inevitable that BU will become bitcoin, and it would not be the end of the world. 
The minority chain would become unusable quite quickly, any attempt to "take back" bitcoin would be met with defensive actions from the main bitcoin chain. If you have 3 times as much hashing power as a competing chain you can run 51% attacks just for fun. The main chain would only have to dedicate a few minutes of hashing power to cause irreplaceable damage. You can also wreck havoc on difficulty by adding / subtracting hash power to make verification times fluctuate rapidly. Im sure there are several options what to do if you really wanted to cripple an inferior chain.
The hash power behind the main chain would be 100% prepared to do this at that point. That is why its such a big decision to dedicate hash power to BU, its implicit that you have to be willing to wage total war. 
The minority chain would be forced to change hashing algo to prevent this. But any change would have to be so big that the hardware the main chain uses cannot attack any longer = the existing hardware the minority chain is using would also become useless. So they would end up switching to mine on the main chain as well, anything else would be irrational.
I hope it will not come to this. If 75% of hashpower actually starts mining BU blocks i think it would be childish by core developers not to just accept defeat and start making the best of the situation. BU is not the end of the world and not the end of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:47:12
Don't change anything. It's the miners that sign the new blocks and there is not a 75% share of miners that signal SegWit, maybe 25% or something. And it's the miners that decide, not the nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:57:36
maybe it would not be considered ethical, in the envisioned scenario, to disregard the wishes of 75% of the mining power...The miners are actually the ones that put down an insane amount of hard cash to make bitcoin happen. They have more vested interest in bitcoin than anyone.

The dishonesty here is that it was "sold" to the entire community that 2x would happen. I am following this subreddit every day and have done so for a LONG time. The subreddit was saturated with rejoice that a compromise had been reached. Are you telling me that the core/blockstream developers sat very very quietly not opposing this. Well aware that the miners would implement Segwit so they they consequently could ignore the 2X part? That is malice and sociopathic behaviour. The honest thing to do would be to VERY VOCALLY state the headline of this thread while the 2X consensus was formed: "Core/Blocksteam will never ever ever accept 2X". This is trickery at game of thrones level. I'm extremely skeptical to have people in charge that are willing to user such methods.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:53:35
Dude. The difference between segwit and segwit2x is 1mb extra blocksize that 90%+ of the network agreed upon. If you are sceptical about central control, i think looking at blocksteam is the right place to start.

If you are skeptical on entities trying to hijack bitcoin, i would start with Blockstream.

Not at all. Look at the global gold market for example. The value of all gold held is around 6.5T$ currently. The gold market is _tiny_ in a global perspective, comparing it to stock, bond and fx markets its insignificant. If bitcoin should reach just 5% of the value of the global gold market (325B$) it would need to go to around 24k$ per coin. The bitcoin market is so tiny that the dollar could do and be what ever it wants and bitcoin price could rise to whatever independently without any relationship. Bitcoin would need to reach a price of several hundred thousand USD per coin before you would need to start depending/speculating on a depreciating USD as a source of price increases.

1. How can anyone control anything by having 1mb extra blocksize?
2. Anyone with a sense of logic and reason can clearly see the danger with Blockstream. Can you explain to me exactly how the investors in Blockstream are going to get a return on their investments? People have put in $x00 millions of USD into Blockstream. Is that to be kind? Their business plan revolves squarely around off chain transactions LN/Sidechains. Can you explain to me just exactly Blockstream is going to give a return on all that investor money if not through fees on the transactions on these LN/sidechains? If the blocksize stays at 1mb its not going to be optional to use LN/Sidechains, its going to be "mandatory". The fees for onchain transactions are going to be huge because you compete with parts of aggregated fees from all the transactions on the LN/sidechains. Im not saying it _has_ to be a trap, but it sure has all the components for bad news for bitcoin in the future. That so many core developers are paid from Blockstream makes it worse, it is impossible to be impartial when making decisions.

I think you will be surprised that bitcoins might be simpler to analyse than many other things. Human psychology drives the price of just about anything, including BTC. The anger and outrage you display here on just the suggestion that bitcoins can have a minor dip in price suggest that you are irrationally bullish on behalf of the price of bitcoins. A price can only go up if there is new money flowing in, a bullish stance suggests that you have already put your money into this bet, if most people have this bullish stance and have put their money in there is not so much fresh money that can flow into the bet - this would manifest itself first as a stagnation in price and then a correction. The correction is really the market testing if its assumption of increasing the price in the first place was correct. If the assumption was correct it will result in a new rally, a new leg. If the assumption was wrong more people will start selling and the price will decrease until such a level that buyers again appears. You should open a book on these things, its fucking interesting!

Well, normal money (physical bills and coins) are not infinitely dividable like bitcoins and though you are right that value isn't created at a steady rate, people are created at a more or less predictable rate. To be sure that you have a monetary base that supports the population growth it would be a good thing. I think he ment it from a practical viewpoint, not from an ideal. Also if it was a "know" factor that the monetary growth would be this much and no more or less it would be a completely transparent and predictable process, everybody would know it in advance. I would even suggest that it should happen in such a way that every citizen got their bank account increased linearly to their deposits = the government does not get first use of the new money.
All things aside, im more happy with bitcoins. Friedmans suggestion would only be the best way it could be arranged under a normal fiat based system.

Bitcoin is the exact opposite of wealth redistribution. Bitcoins only reward those who produce / trade / work and will completely discriminate against those who don't. There are no regular transactions initiated with bitcoins that is not of a voluntary nature = no arbitrary taxation = no arbitrary wealth redistribution. This is why it is going to take off like a bullet when it really catches on, you get to keep the fruits of your labor with no meddling by "democratic" voters anywhere that wants to dip their hands into your livelihood.

This. This will prove once for all the true nature of human beings. There are two choices now:
1. Use bitcoins which will store your money without any loss of value.
2. Use Freicoin which will redistribute wealth at a 4.4% yearly rate.
If people who are pro-redistribution of wealth still use bitcoins they are screaming to the entire world: Im a greedy bastard that wants to keep my own money without sharing it with others. This is the time for socialists everywhere to put their money where their mouths are and poor money into this currency to make it become the ultimate socialist currency. Common, show those capitalist fucks that redistribution is the way to go! I promise i will not make an account and just wait for 4.4% of your wealth to be transferred to me yearly...

For most of the worlds population a credit/debit card you can use online is a dream, even a bank account where you can do international transfers is way out of reach. So to have cash -&gt; bitcoin options will enable lower income / poor people to have access to purchasing things online and storing value a hell of a lot safer than their governments provide. As bitcoins grow and the payment systems becomes easy enough i think developing countries will embrace bitcoins. Its like a digital gold standard that nobody can corrupt = extremely beneficial for economic growth.

What you can do is do buy a lamination machine. You then cut some nice tin/aluminium foil squares to cover up the secret key and qr code and laminate everything together. This way somebody who wanted to redeem the certificate have to simply cut the lamination to extract the original paper not covered by the foil. The lamination will also add a lot of durability to the certificate. I don't know if it would work but i think it would look nice as well.

It would be a coincidence if there was only one sample, but there are so many you would not believe it that backs up this theory. The field of study is called "Socionomics", there is some good on youtube but i do recommend a book on the subject. And i dont buy the argument that everyone would be rich if this had any hold, there are several reasons for this but:
1. There are so many competing investment strategies out there that people subscribe to that this is just one of many. Most people just go by their own feelings. You have to spend a lot of time and money to gain enough knowledge in this topic for it to be useful. People don't do that and those that do have no incentive to teach other people about such a thing if it works.
2. The theory dictates that in order for you to profit you must bet against the market at the point of maximum positive sentiment and bet on the market at the point of maximum negativity. Let me assure you that doing so requires an amount of self control and discipline that very few individuals have. Betting against the market at a time of maximum positive mood requires you to be negative when everyone around you is incredibly positive. This is a very difficult thing to do. This cant really be outsourced either because people would pull their money out of a fund all the time because of apparent lunatic investment moves. Just look at Apple for example, when would be the optimum time to buy the Apple share? It was at the point where they effectively went bankrupt and Microsoft saved them 
I think the theory holds because we humans have so many built in reaction patterns that we cannot help acting out in different situations. For example: You come to your door with full grocery bags in both hands, you lose the keys when you try to unlock the door balancing booth of the bags. You are barely able to pick up the keys to give it another go at unlocking the door without putting down your bags. You lose the keys again. The question is: How many times will you try to pick up the key again before putting down the bags and doing it properly? I think you could do this experiment with a million people and come up with a case that we are hardcoded to doing it 2 times before setting the bags down. Nobody taught us that in school or anything, it is an action that we have all done in some way or another countless of times in our lives, we do it like air and never consider why. There are such patterns of behavior on how we act then we are in a positive / negative mood as well and this can directly be measured in the stock market. The stock market is a numerical value of the combined mood of an entire population in regards to the future. In Greece the stock exchange have declined an incredible 90%+ in just a few short years, im quite sure this value is far below the objective value of the assets owned by greek corporations but that does not matter for the people holding / who held these assets. The assets had to be sold because people had such and incredibly low outlook on the future.

"all account balances are charged a 4.4 per cent annual fee, which is distributed to all of those running the software." can be a little ambiguous, are we talking distribution to all accounts or just the miners?

I think this should be doable in Singapore without more work than you paying a visit to set up the company. There are taxes you have to pay but they are small compared to EU/US etc. There are a lot of companies in Singapore that handles these kinds of setups and will handle all paperwork / accounting / daily duties etc. for you, i think it comes in at about 2k USD / year to have people take care of everything for you, but dont hold me to it, its some time since i checked.
You should also look at Hong Kong, they might be even more ideal to do this through.
There are other options as well depending on what you want to sell, is it digital deliveries or physical goods? If it is digital deliveries you have a lot of options i think, many countries have special rules for exporters that basically means 0% tax and digital goods are so easy to ship.

The entire point of elliotwaves, that the analyst applied here, is that the price itself IS the sum of everyone's individual hopes and fears, necessities, and logical and emotional motivations. So by analyzing how a price moves you can actually deduct how people feel and not the other way around.
Check out this chart:
People have children when they BELIEVE the future will be better and that they will be able to afford food, shelter etc in the future. Do you think all the women in the world is looking at the stock market before making the decision to have children? I think the stock market and its price is a barometer of the general mood of the population. Nobody purchases a share or a currency based on a rational process no more than they ponder deeply on having children, its the feeling of optimism/pessimism that drives the humans action. That is why child birth rates and stock market rates are correlated so closely, they are mirroring the mood of the general population. We are only human so some of our actions, how we react to fear for example are predictable. These waves of optimism / pessimism can be observed in the stock market on all scales, and sometimes they are very clear.
I just find this fascinating. After reading some of this i started noticing these patterns everywhere, the market is defiantly not random walk. It is easy to spot the difference between fractal noise and actual price movements originating from humans.

The 4mb blocksize is only if you live in fairytale land. Back in reality where you can do actual transactions the size is 1mb. 90% of all transactions are non segwit. And there is no evidence that this will change anytime soon. Business and users have rejected segwit. Don't kill the messenger, the aggregated user adoption is a catastrophy. You can put your fingers in your ears and sing lalala as much as you like but that is reality. Of adoption level should rise again the transaction fees will moon again.

Its now that it's most important with a market driven blocksize. The solution to scaling is most probable multi faceted, a mix between offchain / onchain / future tech. But right now, because of the cap, there is a built in bias towards offchain scaling. This means that Mr. Market is operating with at least one hand tied, this in a critical time where there is a great need to discover the correct scaling solution. To make things worse the choices between offchain / onchain scaling has been polarised with both sides basically arguing with value judgement only. This is the exact time that the market (the sum of business and users) needs to be free to discover the most practical and efficient solutions. Just look at the incredibly low amount of segwit transactions, it's obvious Mr. Market is not buying in. And now more noise with PoW change even before the blocksize discussion is settled!? 
@_date: 2018-02-25 12:13:37
TBH im kind of still waiting for the evidence / empirical data / reasoning for the 1MB blocksize cap. The entire premise for this PoW chance is yet again only backed by value judgement.

Once you have transferred your bitcoin to a LN hub there has to be some sort of "token" that is used to track it through the system. The only time the hubs are re-balanced is when they settle their differences on the blockchain. So there definitely has to be an abstraction of your coins once they are used by the hub. If you call it tokens or something else is less interesting.
My point is that it has a _cost_ to transfer Bitcoin in and out of a LN hub (bitcoin blockchain transaction fee + LN hub fee). Because of this cost i would be surprised why there should not arise a market to trade BitcoinLN (Bitcoin already present at the LN network) and BitcoinBTC, Bitcoin present at the Bitcoin Blockchain. Also I would consider a Bitcoin readily available on the Bitcoin blockchain more valuable than a bitcoin on the LN network. Its just a matter of security. So again, i think we will see a currency cross, an exchange rate between LN Bitcoin Tokens, and Bitcoin Blockchain Tokens. It will not happen initially, because the usage of LN will be so tiny. It will only happen when, and if, LN grows big and the LN hub re-balancing blockchain transactions begins to dominate the Bitcoin Blockchain.

I have to have good faith until new information appears. It may seem that magicaltux feared that they would be hacked. Maybe some customers reported strange things happening to their accounts, maybe he saw that somebody was making and controlling many accounts from a single IP. Maybe he saw somebody trying to get access where they should not be. Whatever happened i think he consolidated everything (which is a logical thing to do) so he could move everything to a safe location quickly. If everything is in one place now i would be scared to death touching it for fun if i were him. I mean these hackers can probably find out the IP and start churning at that machine if he starts making transactions to "prove" anything. For the amounts involved here maybe hes even afraid for his physical security. Just give some time, it not like they have 100 people working at this day and night, its just a few standard nerds.

Certainly people (miners) are sitting on them, but the people _buying_ bitcoins are not doing so to sit and hold. I believe the demand and hence the price increase is a result of usage, not speculation. Obviously there is not liquidity in the market to absorb a sales shock if every single holder of coins sold simultaneously, but that is true for all other currencies as well. In my experience with stocks and commodities its never a bubble if everyone thinks it's a bubble, its a bubble when everyone sais it's not. And right now all the posts I read seems to be sure it's a bubble. It will rise on a wall of worry.

There is a 250% difference in the infant mortality rate between Singapore and cuba. That means your child is 2.5 times more likely to die during labor in cuba comapred to singapore, to me that is a meaningful difference. I have seen the equipment the hospitals here in Singapore has to their disposal, there is no way in bleeding hell a third world socialist dictatorship with widespread poverty, corruption, famine and government run healthcare can even come close to this.
I also question the statistical material from Cuba, I mean, it's not exactly as if there is any third party that verifies the governments claims and the press is a pure government propaganda machine.
If you get really sick, you are free to go to Cuba if you chose to, I think I'll take my chances elsewhere. I find my body so important to me that I would not trust anybody without a profit motive to sink a knife into me. It's a little difficult to pursuade people of their own free will to let you opearate on them without a transparent and high success rate. All of these statistics are available from Singapore but not from cuba, I wonder why...
I really hope that crypto currencies can spell an end to socialized medicine so we can actually take the human race to the next level, those collectivist thoughts are just remenants from our evolutionary past where we lived in small groups (collectives). This way of organizing society has become obviously flawed with the rise of cities. Collectivism just don't scale, only Peace scales. Crypto currencies is a tool for peacefull interactions between humans, the exact opposite of collectivism.

No, you are risking FAR less, its already an established marked with lots of participants and a liquid exchange, its close to 0% chance you will not get you money back. But when (in december) people absolutely maxed out their credit cards (and yes, some did) at the peril of never getting a cent in return and having a $10.000 loan at insane interest rate to repay. That is risk. And if you have never had that feeling of putting a fair portion of your financial future on the line you will not understand that feeling. When you cant sleep at night because you worry over if you did the right choice and your gut is absolutely wrenching when that credit card reminder arrive in the mail. That is risk. Those who did that because they were intellectually convinced that this would take off deserve those extra coins.

I don't really see the problem. Bitcoin is a currency that cant be tampered with and transactions that are almost anonymous. Its still in its _birth_. Since this is pretty much as free market as a free market can get with absolutely no rules or regulations and nothing is backed by violence only by peaceful cooperation this is bound to be a bumpy birth. I mean, the general public has not been exposed to anything _remotely_ free market oriented in a hundred years, this is as confusing for everybody as when the soviet union fell and the stores there suddenly learned a new word: profit. Now we have to learn peaceful cooperation and networks of trust have to be built. There will rise services in the bitcoin market that we never would envision in the normal bank market. Its bound to be bumpy for some time but when this baby flies its going to soar...

Seriously: I just travelled half around the globe to see a health care expert in a country with an extremely developed privatized healthcare system (Singapore). If what your saying is true how come Singapore has got the lowest child birth mortality rate on the planet and ranks in at forth in longevity? These two statistics are very telling because obtaining a low birth mortality rate is very technological and costly and since they are number one _all_ of the population obviously has easy access to this technology. The same goes for longevity, it's impossible that just a rich elite have access to good healthcare here, if that was the case the average lifespan would be shorter, but here it is the forth longest on the planet which consequently means that during an average citizens lifespan there is ample healthcare provided for the entire duration. And if you spend just 10 minutes in the singapore healthcare system all of this is verified. There are no ques, the best staff on the planet, the best equipment on the planet, good facilities, no barriers between experts and patients, and since there is no government interference: low low prices. TherThis country puts to absolute shame any socialized health care system on the planet, and a lot of health care refugees come here as a last hope to get treatment. I fled from norway's socialized health care system, and the privatized health care system in Singapore saved my life. And I would have loved to pay them in bitcoins...

yes, but its not fixed at 0.01, you can lower that to what ever number you like, 0.001, 0.00000001. The fee will go down as the currency appreciates but it will always be above cost (and profitable) for the miners. If not, they will stop. Think about it, why should you keep a machine running that costs you $10 in electricity for every $5 you earn?
Also, this is an excellent incentive for miners to start utilizing renewable sources of energy (they can make confirmations using less money on electricity than people burning coal).

It is inevitable that this will happen, and it's a good thing too. If it's not a good thing the market will discover this all by itself, isnt it beautiful to be free of regulation and politicians?
The reason I think it's inevitable is beacause a lot of people have accumulated a lot of coins and they are just sitting still with them, why do that when you can loan them to speculators at interest?
This kind of margin should not be confused by the kind of margin that caused the great depression, the main difference is that the ones who will loan out their bitcoins at interest will know prior that they can't get them back instantly, like a cash deposit in a bank.

That said i hate the spillover from the dark pool into the open market, especially that it doesn't show up in the order book when its really there. This function will be removed by Mt. Gox pretty soon and will be replaced by something else. This is NOT normal market practice in any other exchanges, and i'm willing to wager it will stop being the practice at Mt. Gox also pretty soon.

I re-iterate: "Transaction fees will at a bare minimum rise to price of hardware + electricity + small profit, if not the network would collapse."
Try to use your brain: If the people running _expensive_ machines and using lots of _electricity_ to confirm transactions cant cover these costs they will TURN OFF their machines and sell them = the network would collapse. The price of transactions MUST be profitable, if not there is no bitcoin network for "new people ever getting in" to. This is so simple logic its impossible to misunderstand.

Just this single segment would easily quadruple the price from its current level to 100 USD. What about ingame currency in MMOs? You can actually instantly buy WoW gold, ISK, linden dollars or what they all are called from within the game just by chatting with a seller you dont even know or have ever heard about before.

If the market is pushing and pushing to get through 20 its almost guaranteed to have a price spike similar to the one we saw at 19 when it finally breaks. But IMO its still wrong to buy a lot sub 20 just to "get in before the action". If the market cant break 20 it will symbolize that over 20 is the "wrong" price for bitcoins at the moment and the market will drive the price down. Its just incredible how people buying assets mostly wants to buy them when they are rising in price, the more they rise the more people want to buy, you can see this in the volume of bitcoins as well. Nobody wanted to buy at 0,5, everybody wanted to buy at 25+. We are sheeple that wants to run with the herd.

Its a little bit difficult comparing it to a ponzi scheme as its a currency and not a share/bond which promises yield paid solely by later investors. Also its liquid, something which is rarely true for ponzi schemes. I think most people are confused by bitcoins high valuation and speculation has been "blamed". I tend to think its pure demand for usage which drives the price. Just because there are not so many official stores accepting does not mean there is not a big "dark" demand for the coins. After visiting silk road or route thing i was thoroughly impressed by the entrepreneurship shown by these people. A lot of demand originates from hidden places. Surely this will change and more and more ordinary merchants will start accepting the coins, but this early the road is made while walking.

Its exactly the no bullishit: "what's mine is mine, what's your's is your's and there is nothing you can do about it" thing that makes bitcoins so good, you can actually TRUST the system not to rip you off just because some bankers run amok or some socialists decide to vote to take your money.

The orders that are fulfilled by the dark pool does not show up as volume or a trade at all so its impossible to say 100% sure that there actually is an order at 20 there, but the indirect evidence is pretty convincing, it is _extremely_ rare in financial markets that you have lines as straight as that without something strange going on.

Many people seems to think its a bubble, i dont. I refuse to believe that people are buying and holding bitcoins as pure speculative position at this point, its way to risky. This can only mean that the price is driven up by demand. If the price is driven by usage demand then there is no limit on how high it can go because there are so few coins in circulation compared to the fiat currencies. For every shop that accepts bitcoins the price will be driven higher, for every pornsite that accepts bitcoins it will be driven higher, for every drug dealer that accepts bitcoins it will be driven higher. And it doesnt matter for the enduser if the price is 1 bitcoin or 0.1 or 0.01 for the service it buys, as long as the seller gets his worth in the fiat currency.

Because bitcoins will lead to the demise of socialism, the single biggest killing ideology of human history. Crypto currencies is a protection against arbitrary taxation and provides anonymous ownership of wealth. Socialism cannot exist without arbitrary taxation and wealth re-distribution. Crypto currencies will also be union busting. Unions are the biggest contributors to poverty in thirds world countries. By making labor arbitrage illegal but arbitrage on commodities and other produce legal the unions represents a greed machine to which like the world has never seen before.

These people will flame MMM and defend bitcoin in the occasions where its needed going forward. I don't know what else to expect, this kind of scam was maybe as unavoidable as a gox type incident.

That is called a market. If people disagree on the pricing they should sell into these rise in prices. The market works like an actual functioning democracy, you vote with your money. If you think the price is too low, you vote it up with your money (buy). If you think the price is to high you can vote it down with your money (sell). Any action is permitted as long as the market has transparency (open order book). The market is what it is, nothing more, nothing less. Its not fair or just, it doesn't give handouts, its just there to enable people who wants to buy and sell to do that.

If the MMM is still growing and its actually funneling money into bitcoin the price can go substantially up from here. Maybe shorting is a tiny bit dangerous.

I love bitcoin. I've been involved since 2010. I made that 3D rendering with Aequitas, Libertas, Veritas on it that has been used like 3 zillion times all over the world. I've observed the community daily for 8 years now. I know i'm in my full right when i claim that this sub has taken a turn for the absurd. A dangerous and counterproductive mono culture has taken hold. Its a "either you are with us or against us" mindset (which your reply is a good example of). This is so far far away from what it was. Since i've vested so much time into bitcoin, introduced bitcoin to hundreds of people, years ago. Its just embarrassing to see that the original sales points are being urinated upon. People are coming back to me asking if this is what i told them about all those years ago. I have to say 'no, im sorry'. I would never have expected such a turn of events. Still hodling, still hoping that someone with their heads in the right place can turn the ship.

If bitcoins "takes off" it would make perfect sense and it would be simple to implement. Why not nominate a national currency in the new reserve currency? In reality it would not be the bitcoins themselves used by the country, but they would peg their currency to bitcoins, much like RMB is semi pegged to USD, or the HKD is 100% pegged to USD. It makes doing business with these countries easy and comfortable for holders of bitcoins as its extremely easy to judge value + there is no currency risk involved from time of an order to delivery.

For each of those videos around 5-10x more money has gone into the pyramid. You can pick hundreds at videos at random, check the transaction ID's / accounts on Blockchain.info and see that everything is real. The transactions are real. And bitcoin is the backbone of the pyramid.
Millions and millions of USD are flowing into bitcoin every day from MMM from China alone. Philippines and South Africa is tricked into this Pyramid as well.

MMM has a substantial impact on the price and when that pyramid collapses its going to collapse bitcoin as well (temporarily as always). There is nothing that have more people running to the exit simultaneously than a pyramid scheme.

Well, its still irrational. That nerd has a lot of coins. He started mining very early to have many coins. If he started mining very early it was because he read the documentation and got a conviction this was a sound plan. Not only did he think it was a sound plan but he also had do have a personal conviction other than greed (according to you, and i agree). No matter what his conviction he would end up with _more_ money to realize this conviction in reality if he sold his coins with a rational plan. Now other people, maybe without any convictions, or even worse, convictions opposed to him will profit from his irrationality. Its important to think big.

I can only disagree. Its the miners that decide on the rules, they vote with hashing power. Theoretically: What _possible_ method of recourse would an army of non-mining nodes have against miners if they changed the consensus rules? A big fat zero. Nothing. The only thing non-mining nodes has is a copy of the blockchain up to the point where the consensus rules were changed. Wow. You know how also have _exactly_ the same copy? The miners. And they can't change the past so the ledger stays exactly the same with them. If there were any need to download a copy of the ledger up to a certain block number there is no reason not to do it from a miner. Non-mining nodes are an abomination, never mentioned in the white paper, a relic from when the miners abandoned CPU mining and upgraded to GPU mining. They only cause the network to slow down through slowing down block propagation between miners (which is why all pools/miners connect directly to each other so they can spare spending bandwidth and processing time talking to non-mining nodes). Pools/miners connected to non-mining nodes only face an increased chance of mining orphaned blocks. I have no idea where the idea that non-mining nodes had any goal or purpose began.
@_date: 2018-04-13 06:16:37
A mining node is akin to an author with a library. A non-mining node is akin to a library. It's nice that libraries want to keep a copy of all the work the authors do, for reference. But no amount of libraries will increase the amount of authors. There is also a counter productive part of libraries: Once an author is finished writing a new book he needs to be certain he is not plagarizing one of his peers. So he have to check other libraries to see if his work is already published. The only libraries worth checking is obviously libraries owned by other authors, since these will have new publications first and authors don't want to waste a single second writing on a book another author already wrote. Even worse: the author (by default) has no way to know if the library he is connected to is a passive library or a library owned by another author. What might happen is that he checks his connected libraries for similar works, finds none, and published his new book and continues working on the sequal. Later it turns out that another author already published a book similar to his - and a majority of the other authors agree that the other author was first. Disaster: the author is robbed of his fee from the original book + all the time working on the sequal is wasted. At this time the author is quite annoyed: it was not even his fault, but the libraries reporting that this was an original work. So he makes sure to find out the addresses for other author owned libraries and makes exclusive connections to these. Authors have their own network of libraries to be sure that they don't waste time writing already written books. Authors not hooked up to this network loses out and have an economic incentive to join the author owned network of libraries.
Non-mining nodes are useless. They only slow down and confuse the network. Serves no purpose.

Ive been hodling longer and more than most - yet my opinion is is to be snuffed. There is no humility any longer, even though Bitcoin  is continually improving there is no curiosity to even rhink the thought: maybe we are wrong and that this specific path is wrong.

Seriously, you have _no_ idea what you are talking about.
All brokers, banks, institutional investors, have and use dark pools every single day. There are more stocks traded within dark pool than on the open exchanges every single day. Most trades happens in dark pools and not on open exchanges.
If you look at the bottom of that wiki link there is a list of some of the dark pools in operation in the US and as you can see _all_ the major players have their own pools. Even the exchanges themselves operates dark pools, just like MT. Gox.
I have my self used a dark pool when i buy / sell stock on the NYSE - several times. 
Again, answer my question:
What is the difference between selling/buying in a "dark pool" and selling/buying a larger quantity of coins on the bitcoin-otc?

Well, when this bubble pops its going to be more damaging for bitcoin than what ever amount of shorters could manage. What the shorters wil provide here, if they step up and get the price down, is that less money will end up in the hands of criminals. The shorters are probably also more attuned to bitcoin and its future than MMM so the shorters will turn to buyers when MMM is crushed. I rather like that then giving more money to MMM backmen.

Much better to have some bitcoin mullah, rabbi or priest to decide what is the _one and true bitcoin_, that has turned out so well.
Mining power measured over time is the most democratic, fair, accessable and uncensorable way of determining this. Anyone can vote, noone can stop people from voting. It's the exact mechanism described in the white paper that should decide which chain is Bitcoin. The reason it's described like this is that Satoshi forsaw factions competing like something out of Life of Brian. It's fascinating to see this post being top post in both and It is something that resonates in both camps. 
@_date: 2015-11-01 18:58:09
1. Check this: 
This is the backend of MMM. This is what all the participants have to use to join MMM.  From 4-5 minutes in it get very clear that the backbone of MMM is run on bitcoin.
2. There are almost 50.000 "MMM Pays"/"MMM Pay" videos on Youtube where people are claiming to had payouts from MMM. Many of these videos shows the actual transaction in the backend interface to prove its happened.
3. There are literally thousands of "MMM Event" videos on youtube showing massive amounts of people being shown on a big screen how the interface works and people helping them to sign up. The bitcoin logo is being used in many of these videos on boards and posters.
Im not a hacker or statistician but i know something is amiss when i see it, there is something going on here that involves bitcoin in a very negative way. The only question is if the magnitude is small or big.
@_date: 2015-11-01 13:18:48
I agree. Its difficult to understand the scope of bitcoins involvement. Which is why the collective "eye of bitcoin sauron" must focus on this issue and try to discover the true extent. What is apparent is that bitcoin is an integral part of the backend. They are promising 30%-100% interest rate per month. This draws people in, it basically promises financial freedom to poor people and that they will become rich. Back this promise up with "MMM Pays" / Happy Day videos in the thousands and you have a potent trap.
@_date: 2015-11-01 09:13:33
Spend a few minutes on YouTube. Search for "MMM event", " MMM payout", "MMM rally" etc. When you start to grasp the scale of this your mind will be blown. It's the world's first global pyramid fueled by bitcoin and poor unbanked people with smartphone.
edit: It seems like youtube has actually purged out 30k+ videos if you search for "MMM payout". You can still seach for "MMM pay" and get 16k videos of people cashing out.
@_date: 2015-11-11 21:12:19
The scheme is pretty cleverly orchestrated on multiple levels. The members don't have to transfer any bitcoin to MMM itself. They only transfer funds directly to other participants. In this way all participants hold bitcoin in their own wallet and all participants have created accounts with OKCoin, Huobi etc. (these two primarily).
What the MMM backend keeps track of is who should transfer what to whom and when. This is done through an internal accountancy unit called Mavros.
Im not 1000% sure how it works in detail but the basic jist is somewhat like this:
1. You register and in some way indicate how much you are willing to participate with. 
2. A "help" request is sent to you. A help request is basically someone else caching out. Say a user wants to cash out $1000 then this sum is split up and multiple users are asked to fund the cashout. Your share of this cashout might be $100. You then have 24 hours to transfer the bitcoin to his account. If you fail to do so your account in MMM will be closed and you will not be able to re-join.
3. If you actually send the bitcoin the system will see the transaction in the blockchain. This will credit your account with Mavros. The Mavros grow by 100% every month. Its the amount of Mavros in your account that determines how much "help" you can ask for at a later point in time.
4. If you enlist people you get 10% of their Mavros added to your Mavros. This stacks multiple layers downwards so the more people you get under you in the pyramid the more "help" you can ask for.
5. There is also something called "guidance bonus". Im not entirely sure how the mechanism for this works but its obviously connected to getting more members in.
Because of the way its rigged its very difficult to estimate the size of MMM. If you ask them they have 4 million users globally and 500k in China. It might be crazy high or it might be low, there are incentives to both state small and large numbers.
What i can say is that there is a _substantial_ amount of people drawn into this thing. If you go to youtube and search for "mmm pays" you will get 50k+ results and they all seem to be exactly what they claim. That means that 50k people have requested "help" from the system and gotten it. I cant see any reason to doubt the contents of these movies, many of them screencapture the backend of MMM showing the bitcoin transactions. You dont have to look at many videos before someone actually clicks the transaction so you can see the transaction ID. Ive checked several of these myself, its all in the blockchain.
All of these 50k have in some way earned a lot of Mavros to be able to make big withdrawals. Since the nature of the pyramid only credits Mavros after a bitcoin transaction under you has actually happened its safe to say that all of these 50k have a lot of people beneath them. Although most of the videos are in chinese you can still hear them say things like "10 manager", "100 manager", "1k manager" and "10k manager". That means they have 10,100,1000,10000 people beneath themselves in the pyramid.
If you youtube a thing like "mmm event". You get to see evidence of widespread recruitment. In schools, churches, community houses, stages. There are rallies in every which form. In a lot of these rallies you will se the Bitcoin logo on posters etc.
There are two branches of the scheme, MMM global and MMM China. MMM global is bitcoin only. MMM China is both bitcoin and RMB.
Its also difficult to asses size based on traffic on the official MMM sites. Because managers whants to recruit people that are under them in the hierarchy they create their own MMM websites and facebook groups. If you start googling / facebooking a bit you will find hundreds of facebook pages and webpages in local language with a few hundred / thousand followers. So it really flies beneath the radar in every which way. I think the structure is cleverly engineered so that:
1. Its difficult to estimate size.
2. There is no link between the banking system and MMM
3. There is no central webpage or facebook page
4. The users hold their own funds, no centralization
5. Its completely non-transparent that the people who request "help" are actual members and not the founders.
If its as big as it seems to be its beyond doubt influencing the price and demand of bitcoin in some way.
@_date: 2015-11-01 10:51:03
Let me just tell you that MMM is massively big. China, Philippines, India, South Africa and Indonesia + other SE countries are drawn into this. If you take 5 minutes of your time and start googling around this topic it will become apparent to you extremely fast how big this is and how dangerous it is. Go to youtube and search for "MMM Payout" you get 30k videos with people bragging about MMM payouts in the magnitude of a few hundred USD to hundreds of thousand. If you search youtube for "MMM event" you get so see the scale of the problem. Hundreds of thousands of poeple are drawn into this. MMM is pushed in schools, churches, community houses, shopping malls, everywhere. Its Massive.
My guesstiamte is a bare minimum of 600-700 Million USD has been poored into bitcoin the last few months through MMM.
The Chinese exchanges are very well aware of the magnitude:
Bobby Lee, CEO of Chinese exchange BTCC, told CoinDesk his platform has seen a significant volume increase, though he dismissed much of his competitors' volume as "artificial".
Those behind the volume, he said, are not traders but consumers sucked into a Russian ponzi scheme, MMM.
"We have posted warnings on our site and on our social media to warn users to be careful, but they have been coming to our exchange and buying out like crazy," he said, adding:
"This time it's not speculative trading but based on them getting sucked into this ecosystem."
This is something the community needs to become aware of. Its going to impact bitcoins reputation.

Im not saying its death for bitcoin. But it is not good for bitcoin when the target audience (underbanked/unbanked) first meeting with bitcoin is losing their life savings.
Comparing this with the dollar is a bit off. What ever pyramids are built with dollars is doomed to be just a tiny tiny fraction of the dollars users. MMM here is boosting 4 Billion USD of "donations". That is as much money that has entered bitcoin for many many months. Compared to the organic growth of bitcoin MMM (if their own words are correct) is overshadowing.

You are welcome to do a detailed analysis. If you just go through about 50-100 pages of MMM Pays videos you will get a impression about average payouts (I recon its about 2000-3000 USD, there is a lot that is below this number, but there is a lot substantially above as well, the biggest i saw i think was just below 100k). If you multiply that number with the number of posts you are going to end up with an estimate. From that point you have to make some assumptions about the people actually posting. Do think the people posting are the ones at top of the pyramid? Upper middle? Middle? Lower bottom? or bottom? I think the people posting are probably around middle or lower bottom. Everyone above the middle surely knows whats going on and are not interested in being identified. I also think that the people posting are the "managers" (MMM have a recruitment educational program you go through). They use the video to recruit even more. I think its safe to say that there are magnitudes more people involved than what you can see from the "MMM Pays" videos. 
You can even pick a single day and sift through the Pays videos, there has been around 300-400 just today. 
I don't understand where all these videos should pop up from. Did someone fork up a lot of money on fiverr to have freelancers make them? Id like to see the evidence of that. Most probable they are accurate. Its evident from the Event videos that a lot of people are involved here, everything cant be faked.

I completely agree, its just that in those 20 minutes when this nerd sold something that what must amount to (possibly) several yearly wages for a working professional he would have earned at least 50% more if he had just paid attention to the order book. Now, for all we know he just sold a few thousand of a few hundred thousand and he felt a little vein, but still.

If you look at 'MMM Pays' videos on youtube and try to extrapolate you reach a figure of around 100-150m USD. That is however only the people making videos of themselves posting on youtube. You can multiply that 100mUSD with any percentage you guess are not willing to post a youtube video of themselves. Then you can assume that the people posting this is near the bottom of the pyramid. Anyone earning more than x would not like to a)broadcast their vast earnings or b)the figure is so high its obvious something fishy is going on. MMM themselves claim that 4 Billion USD has been "donated". If this is a lie or not im not sure but to me it seems like a plausible number considering the activity and amount of MMM Pays videos. The big question is how much of this has been funneled through bitcoin and how much still remains in bitcoin. I cannot post the link where MMM is stating these figures. My comments/posts are banned/removed if they contain links to MMM. If you google it yourself the basic stats are at the .biz domain of MMM.
@_date: 2015-11-01 18:46:02
Do you have any plausible explanation? What are all these MMM events? What are all these MMM Pays videos? Why are there numerous MMM videos showing the MMM backend utilizing bitcoin? 
From Coindesk:
Bobby Lee, CEO of Chinese exchange BTCC, told CoinDesk his platform has seen a significant volume increase, though he dismissed much of his competitors' volume as "artificial".

"We have posted warnings on our site and on our social media to warn users to be careful, but they have been coming to our exchange and buying out like crazy," he said, adding: "This time it's not speculative trading but based on them getting sucked into this ecosystem."
If MMM is NOT big and has NOT involved a lot of people and they are NOT using bitcoin you need to start constructing some kind of alternate reality which explains all of this.
The question is not if, its only a question of magnitude. By design these things are made to be obscure to get an overview over. So you have to use the evidence that is available. And that is user posts and events. Its obvious its big.

As an expat that has lived in Philippines i can just say this is a big deal. Paying bills in Philippines is a major pain on a level unseen in the west, not only for expats but for everyone. The banks dont have online services. So you have to physically travel around with cash / checks to all your vendors and settle all the bills in person. Everyone is doing this so you have to stand in _long_ lines to give them your money. All the bills have to be settled every month. On the list provided by Rebit it looked like i could pay my Electricity, internet and waterbill and more without leaving the house. They have many of the larger vendors, i recon they will add more over time. I hope this will be used. Im not a religious man but Rebit is doing gods work in Philippines.

Is bitcoin a capitalist finance currency? I completely disagree. Bitcoin is open, transparent, accessible to everyone from Bangladesh to New York. Every facet of the ecosystem is accessible in exactly the same way even if you are a farmer or a billionaire. The rules are perfectly tuned for neutrality. Its free from usary. Cant think of any aspect of bitcoin that could be considered unfair.

In the strictest sense, no. But you might easily imagine that if the price got very low. In the period before miners shut down they would hoard the coins they produce instead of selling them. This would effectively limit supply which would to some degree push the price upwards.

You are helping a lot by buying coins and not spending them. What you are doing is effectively removing coins from circulation, temporarily lowering the money supply. Doing this increases the purchasing power of the coins actually in circulation. This works out to you giving an interest free loan to everybody that wants to use bitcoin for productive purposes. You are doing the second best thing for the bitcoin economy next to hiring people developing more bitcoin products and services. Do not spend a single coin just for the sake of spending, doing so hurts the overall chance of bitcoin succeeding.

You are correct in a 100+ years. But in the present bitcoin _is_ actually inflating. So what we are seeing today is _Price Deflation_. Prices are going down, but not because of a shrinking money supply. The monetary deflation that bitcoin will "suffer" under is going to be extremely mild because of lost coins when its fully mined. Im all pro-deflation, it has already been proved that it has no impact on production - the US under the gold standard up until 1913 was an economic powerhouse.

There is a way to fix this, you can redo the transaction again from your wallet, this time with a fee. What will happen is that the new transaction will go through and get confirmed, the old one will be faulty once upon a time in the future when its added to the blockchain.

Don't confuse backing by the necessity of physical currency, the currency would solely exist digital as today. There would just be custodians in bitcoin friendly countries which would trade anyone's bitcoins with the backing. If somebody set up such a scheme it would be a huge threat to bitcoin.

The only reason you don't see privately funded and owned roads of ridiculous high quality is that it is de facto illegal all over the world. It was private enterprise that first built the first railroads, airplanes, subways. It is dirt cheap to fly, it is dirt cheap to take railroad, it is dirt cheap to buy cars. I think people would manage to mix some asphalt and lay it without some nanny state to hold their hand. If you want a pretty sweet example how good private enterprise can do public transportation you can check out the subway in Singapore. I would argue that this is the most pleasant, beautiful, clean, efficient and punctual subway system on the planet. It is privately run by a stock exchange listed company. At the same time it is extremely cheap to use compared to other systems. Singapore is a high cost country, even more so than the US or UK.

Those top 100 addresses contain the accounts for all the exchanges, gambling sites, silkroads etc. Its not possible to see which is which. If you remove these wallets + the coins satoshi mined its far more distributed.
The early adopters who have struck rich are very few compared to everybody who get unjustly rich "in the real world" by lobbying for rules and regulation that skew monetary and interest policy in their favour. With bitcoin that jig is up, the little guy have access to market without barriers.
The early adopters took a lot of risk. They spent a lot of time, effort to create/learn/educate themselves and others about bitcoin. If it was not for the extreme persistence and endurance of these people there would be no bitcoin. You can put your jealousy in your pipe and smoke it. Start a new currency yourself and work 7 days a week coding / promoting and selling it - for free. Years of work with no pay and only a one in a million chance of success. The reward is high because it was unlikely to become such a hit. You should respect and cherish those visionary hard-headed people. They deserve all the riches and they will spend most of that money further developing crypto currency and supporting infrastructure.
The 99.999% that you talk of. Bitcoin is not a "get rich scheme". Its a payment network / currency that have some absolutely incredible, never seen before properties. This is offered to the public - completely free to use. It offers merchants and individuals the lowest transaction cost of any financial instrument in history. Just be content with getting access to such a system - for free. If a company or government ran this crypto currency there would be all sorts of tracking / back doors and uncontrolled inflation. If it's not enough to get all of this for free then the 99.999% are ass holes not deserving good things in life.
The first mover advantage here is so big that unless the bitcoin community do some very very bad choices bitcoin will keep on growing. And it will always be on the frontiers technology wise. Why? The early adopters didn't spend time and money on bitcoin as a get rich scheme. I've been observing the community since late 2009. The early adopters are highly politically motivated. They believe bitcoin will chance society for the better. The handfuls of individuals here will not spend their new found wealth on fluff and consumerism. They will tender to their baby. The newly popped up competing currencies however are most probably created by people motivated by greed. What would be the point of releasing a new currency blueprinted of bitcoin with the only difference being the seed and some cosmetic changes? Purely motivated by easy monetary gain.

I can assure you, the dollar on gold backing was not a worthless piece of paper, it was the most secure and advanced currency ever used on a large scale. The dollar on gold backing created the economy that gave us the worlds first cars, airplanes, skyscrapers, electricity, telephone and whatnot. It is the legacy of this long gone backing that now, even 100 years after, is still so strong it is difficult to let go of it. That is how powerful backing is. Yes bad things can happen to the custodians, but the bitcoin's themselves will remain exactly as they are all the time. No modification or change is needed in the blockchain or anywhere else.

I'm not entirely convinced it would end boom and busts but bitcoin would certainly put a damper on the cycles. A boom happens when a large part of the economy's resources are mal invested resulting in a bust when the wrongful allocation collapse. Traditionally government have really excelled at misplacing resources on costly and counterproductive projects that have collapsed. However nothing prevents misallocations to happen in the free market as well, its just less likely. I like to think of it as a room full of investors, then somebody in the corner would yell "internet!!!" and everybody would run to the same corner of the room at the same time creating a huge over investment in internet stock. This is what happened prior to the 1999 Nasdaq bubble, everybody was so sure that the internet was the next big thing that useddiapers.com had a valuation of billions. In the bitcoin sphere the same could happen. If i i did not read wrong the other day satoshidice is valued at 3.3 billion USD, if that is the case its a little bit difficult seeing how that could turn out good for all the investors running to that corner of the room at the same time. Just to reiterate, a limit on money printing will certainly limit booms and busts, but not eliminate them.

1. Order a Yubi Key. (just google it)
2. Create new wallet at blockchain.info (just follow the steps, read EVERYTHING written on screen from page one at least once and contemplate on the words before continuing)
3. Enable two factor authentication with your yubikey.
4. Enable second password. Never type it, always mouse.
5. Enable IP lock if you have a fixed IP address at home.
6. Backup the blockchain wallet to your email, skydrive and dropbox. (just press the backup button)
7. Never, NEVER, NNEEVVEEEEEER log in from a public machine. Use a Ubuntu bootCD or bootUSB, boot from this every time you want to log in and do transfers.
8. Use a second wallet on your phone for day to day spending needs. Never keep more money in this wallet than you are comfortable losing.

It is exceedingly easy to start and run businesses in Singapore. Extremely simple rules, low taxation and little regulation.
Singapore could defiantly improve on the personal liberty front, but its pretty apparent that economic freedom is maybe the most important freedom to have when it comes to standard of living. Most of the other freedoms will be impossible to stop from rising over time as long as the population have economic freedom.

When the market is big enough and the price high enough there will begin to develop mature futures and derivatives markets. Once the futures and derivatives markets are high in volume and deep in liquidity there will begin developing a debt market. Once the debt market is large the price stability of bitcoin will be good enough for people to nominate their labor in bitcoin. Once people start nominating their salary in bitcoin it will reach a plateau of stability that enables outright pricing in bitcoin. It will be predictable what something will cost to finance and produce in bitcoin. Then it will reach a level that you can call it a true currency or money. We are far away from this.

I'm not sure about millions. The "problem" is that as they get increasingly valuable there will grow a bitcoin derivatives market that will create a lot of bitcoin "equivalents". In effect the money supply will become far larger than the 21 million. This will put a damper on the price increases. I don't even want to guess what the maximum price will be of bitcoin.

You are a statist. You think the government actually have a role in providing goods and services. Your world, though you claim to be "against violence", is _completely_ saturated with coercion and violence - it cannot function on any level without it. That is the essence of stateism. Your world have _no place_ for voluntary participation, only forced participation. Your world sees human beings as mindless cattle that needs to be herded by demi-god-like politicians. Cattle that is unable to fend for themselves or take correct and adult choices. Because of the peoples stupidity the government must be strong and provide for the incompetent. 
I _completely_ reject and refuse to accept this idea. The state is the worst possible organizer of society. 
Bitcoin represents the antithesis of your statist stance. Bitcoin is founded on the principle of voluntary participation. There exists no coercion with bitcoin. In your world the state is the rule maker, the initiator of violence. With bitcoin the protocol itself is the rule maker, it cant be reasoned with, perverted or changed arbitrarily. You can only chose, voluntary, to participate or not. If you participate your _only_ option is to conform to the very simple rules of the free market: In order to consume you must first produce. Those who produce most will get to consume most. By being a productive, honest and hard working individual that respect other peoples lives, livelihood and property you will succeed. You are forced to submit being peaceful towards the other participants, it is impossible for you to impose any arbitrary taxation. Every transaction is initiated by a mutual beneficial trade. If a trade between two holders of bitcoins are not mutually beneficial it will not happen.
These are the basic rules that a wealthy productive society is build on. These are the rules that man is made to oblige to. These are the rules that the state piss on which is the reason the western "democracies" are in such a quagmire today. The unproductive gets to consume as if they were productive. The productive is punished for their productivity resulting in apathy and depression. The state as it exists today is anti-human.
What you have to open your mind to is that a society build from the foundations of voluntary participation and not violence / coercion is going to be magnitudes more productive, efficient, peaceful, fair, including and generous.
I appeal to your intellectual integrity to investigate how problems in society can be solved by not reverting to the crude coercive nature of statism but letting peaceful, non-violent relations between humans solve things. Peace is completely superior in all respects to solving our problems. Peaceful interaction is such a powerful idea, just look at how bitcoin explode in price and usage, this happens only because there is a craving for this, a deep desire to be free of the states filthy grasp. To be able to transact without the chains of the state around your hands.
Bitcoin: By the people - for the people.

It has a profound bias to being Price Deflationary. It is still in a phase of Inflation. There are more coins in existence today than yesterday or one week ago. When it is finished inflating in 100+ years. It will be an _extremely_ mild monetary deflationary currency. Some coins will be destroyed now and then reducing the total money supply.

For mostly all of the early adopters its more about ideology. The monetary value of bitcoin is just a (convenient) side effect. There are of cause a lot of speculators. Most of the coins are controlled by people who genuinely wants to make bitcoin an alternative to traditional banking. If you look just a little bit under the hood of the largest account holders you will see that funds are rarely transferred. If your premise was correct and that money was the true motivation and that that this is a pyramid scheme they would have sold a long time ago. All of the top 500 accounts hold enough bitcoin to make anyone extremely wealthy by any standard. But this has not happened. Why? Because you dont change your bitcoins for FIAT when you got involved with bitcoin to escape FIAT in the first place.

I don't subscribe to this view. Vendors have to offer something in the present that is more valuable than any perceived  value increase in the future. People buy drugs in Silkroad without even considering that the future purchasing power will increase. Why? The product that is provided through Silkroad is more valuable to them in the present than more of the same thing in the future. Vendors that does not provide something that triggers such a reaction cannot honestly expect to survive in the bitcoin market. Another example is the ASIC miners, these are products that are typically aligned with the bitcoin economy and will tease people into spending in the present instead of the future. So i say: Do not spend your bitcoins on fluff and consumerism. Spend them on products and services that are more valuable to you in the present than in the future. This will put the bar very high for spending coins which in turn will force only the most useful, productive, rare and desirable things to be sold for bitcoins. While hoarding you are giving an interest free loan to those who use the bitcoin currency for productive means, which is the biggest gift you can give.

I have no hope for low volatility any time soon. Very few coins being chased by more and more people all over the world. With bitcoin there is only one valve that can equalize the pressure: price. Volatility will not subside until the price is insanely much higher than now. And if the price is going to get insanely high there will be volatility and lots of it.

I think the internet is really untouchable at this point. Nothing have been done to stop TOR, nothing have been done to stop Piratebay. The efficiency gain in the economy because of the internet is so huge and so many vital systems in finance and logistics is dependant on the internet that it cannot be undone without major, major pain. People are addicted to the internet like heroin, it will never be accepted to limit the internet back to a kindergarten typewriter level. TOR is not illegal because the government already knows that passing such a law would have exactly zero effects on its usage. The Piratebay is allowed to operate without hinders because making it illegal would force all the pirates to the TOR network. If that happened the TOR network would become the mainstream internet - the government is scared of that happening. Bitcoin is in the same category, its impossible to make illegal, its impossible to tax. They can only act as with TOR, try to say as little as possible about it and hope it doesn't get mainstream adoption. I really see a future where the statists are losing a great deal of their power, and they really cant do anything about it. The only logical thing to do for them in the end is to abolish personal income tax, shift the entire tax burden over to a consumption tax on physical goods.

Ill try to explain as simple as possible:
You have two types of orders, a limit order or a market order. With a limit order you specify a quantity and price that you will buy or sell at. With a market order you just specify the quantity and press buy/sell and the trade will happen at what ever prices are available until the desired quantity is bought or sold. Traders who are disciplined will mostly use limit orders, if you have access to a realtime updated marked data you can use market orders. Newbies however will probably use exclusively market orders, the limit orders just seems much more complex. So what will happen is this:
1. You are a enlightened trader that have bitcoins to (in this example) sell.
2. You can also code a bot.
3. You create a bot that watch the market for a specific opportunity; when the spread between buyer and seller is higher than say 0.2 BTC
4. If the spread is higher than this you immediately sell 0.01 btc. This puts the last market price at the lowest possible point of the 0.2 spread. So for example the buyers are willing to give 29.1 and the sellers demand 29.3 you will "park" the price at 29.1 using just 0.01 BTC
5. At the same time you put some of your coins up for sale just below the 29.3 that other sellers demand, say for example at 29.29.
6. For any buyer not checking the marked depth it will look like the price to buy coins for is 29.1 when in reality the only coins for sale are yours for 29.29. 
7. Hope that some dude comes along and press buy button at market price.
8. You get to sell your coins at almost 0.2 BTC more than the current highest bidder. Profit!
It is a simple trick to make it look like the price is higher or lower than it really is. This was just a simple explanation so you know just a little how to think, this method is probably not used exactly as i said now because the goal of these traders is not to either buy in large or sell in large but to buy and sell many times earning a little bit extra. Since the trades are fully automated its basically earning money for free 24/7. However this behaviour is not so destructive as it sounds, for us regular mortals this practice will actually drive down the spread between buyer and seller. Lower spreads is a good thing for everybody.

I don't think any action on any level is necessary to protect bitcoin from government, government will _ignore_ bitcoin. Government will stick its head in the ground and pray and hope bitcoin does not catch on. The government do this to one more technology with great success: The TOR network. They know if TOR catch on it is 100% game over for most kinds of the crazy surveillance they do, so their tactic is: Don't do anything that force or even hint a huge amount of users over to the TOR network. I think this is the reason the pirate bay is allowed to operate. I mean, how difficult could it possibly be for ICANN, a UN controlled organization, to drop the DNS records for TPB? They will never do this, there is already a completely operational Pirate Bay on the TOR network. If The Pirate Bay was dropped from the regular internet hundreds of millions of users would start using TOR, TOR would quickly become _the_ internet. By making TOR illegal they would be waving a big red flag: Use this technology to avoid our spy network, we can't even stop you if we tried. By making TBP illegal they would force people to TOR. They cannot make the internet itself illegal, it is completely impossible at this point. Government have completely lost control at this point, their monopoly on violence have lost many of its teeth. There is an incredible amount of freedom on the Internet and it cant be taken back. Bitcoin is in the same category, _nothing_ can stop it if it starts getting widespread and mainstream. Just like any law against piracy or TOR is just as ineffective. Their best hope is to just sit still and be quiet and hope that their inaction have the same effect on Bitcoin as on the TOR network. The jig is really starting to slip for big government, and they don't realize it yet because things are happening so insanely fast for those old people. Economic crises or not, the future just around the corner looks incredibly bright for everybody willing to embrace the new emerging global economy not run by government but by the people. I love it. Just 5-6 years ago everything looked so bleak, now the contours of something great is starting to shape, a new dawn, this is going to one hell of a ride to be in on for those willing.

It ISN'T a currency, so it cant be treated as a currency - YET. Nothing is priced in Bitcoin, so you cannot label it a currency by any stretch of the imagination. Everything is priced in other currencies (USD, Euro, RMB etc) and the price is converted to the bitcoin equivalent. Its not a currency until its priced in Bitcoin without any "support". Its just like gold, it took a long time before gold became currency. This is the absolutely best Bitcoin could hope for at this moment. Its completely legal to own, buy, sell, trade, speculate in etc. The alternative was a ban on all fronts.

It is impossible to do naked shorts with bitcoin. Shorting with CFD instruments doesn't impact the market price. Basically if shorting is to happen that actually influence the market price actual coins needs to be borrowed from somebody who own them outright and sold at markets that affect the price. A healthy market needs the ability for short sales as this removes a lot of volatility. Only the good kinds of short sales are available for bitcoin.

"Bitcoin is mistakenly seen as a sort of Socialist-ideal"
You have to exlain this. Bitcoin is the polar opposite of anything socialist. Bitcoin is actually civilized and peaceful, not stacked to the roof with coercion and unfairness like socialsim. The bitcoin protocol itself is the only coercion with bitcoins, and the protocol strickly enforces the purest of capitalism: What's mine is mine, what's yours is yours, the only reason anybody will part with their coins is if they feel they do a trade which leaves both parties better of. Bitcoins are backed by _working_ people, not moochers, which is the _exact_ reason its going to become so incredible valuable.

Yes, they do this already now. Im an expat living in Philippines. They don't use bitcoin to invest in, they actually use it as the payment network it was meant to be. I think you are way out of sync with the developing world if you think its still just a struggle to get food on the table. Most of the economies in Asia are purely cash based, but there is serious money circulating here. Everybody have access to Internet and smartphones are as common as anywhere else. Here in Philippines for example there are 100 million people. My guess is that just 1% have a Visa card. But the average salary in the city I live in is around $700 a month. The Pinoys here buy bitcoin and buy a gift card at Amazon for example. Its basically the only way they can buy something at amazon right now.

Bullshit. You assume that if the government don't do it nobody else would. What about cars, airplanes, television, electricity, telephones etc where these also invented by government? Private enterprise have by far done more to roll out products and services than government.
Who would you rather give your money to:
This guy:
or these clowns:
Right now 60% of your taxmoney is going straight into feeding the military industrial complex and war. If you want to spend most of your worklife helping those insane warmongering lunatics you are free to do so, i will at least _try_ to be peaceful and productive by working hard and keeping as much of my money away from the grasp of the loonies.
If taxation and the products and services delivered by the government were so fantastically good and efficiently produced, why the hell do they have to threat people at gunpoint with jail to get them to pay? I have never been coerced by Microsoft, Samsung, Cathay Pacific, BMW or any other company buying their goods and services, they always deliver good quality at the right price. The government delivers shit at horrible prices, the only way they get people to use their crappy services is by pure force. If people had a choice nobody would touch anything they produce.
Bitcoin is a small start where you can opt out of this insanity. What will happen is that for the first time people can see how fast, strong, solid and good voluntary trade can be. Peace is always better than coercion. Its just that the government have outlawed peace so they can look good themselves.

Though I don't know the specifics of the Coinbase business im quite sure its actually not Coinbase that have deemed you 'High Risk' but their bank. Banks are required by law to check all transactions and classify what kind of bracket you are in. To get on the high risk shitlist is basically insanely easy, this is because they will not judge you as an individual, they will look at your family and relations. Believe it or not, this is how insane this world have become now. So if you have a close relative or family member that is a business owner, politician, judge, prosecutor, [insert a long list of professions, public positions etc] you will get on that high risk list.

As someone with two decades of trading experience, let me give you a few good points:
1. Buy at exchanges.
2. Don't buy everything at once. Buy over time, a chunk every 14 days / month spread over a year. If what you consider a _huge_ opportunity arises, then you can buy more, you actually have cash available.
2. Don't transfer everything at once. 100k is a lot of money by any _sane_ measurement. 100k should never be "fuck-you-money" no matter how rich you get, that is the safest way you know you have the potential to get poor again.
The exchanges are still young and fragile, they can go bust and you don't want to lose 100k in one go.
3. Unless you are a _seasoned_ trader: Just hold and spend coins on buying things you want and need. If you try to daytrade, even weektrade im willing to bet you will lose if you are a regular person. You will be tempted to sell low and buy high or the opposite. You need to have such control of your feelings and greed to be able to trade that few people have.
4. Take 10k of those 100 and buy shares in bitcoin related companies. Its risk assets but they have even more upside than the bitcoins themselves. Companies with income nominated in bitcoin is obviously preferable. Here you need to do thorough research, but this helps the bitcoin economy immensely.

I dont think people even know what stable means. Stable, compared to what? The US Dollar, which has lost 95%+ of its purchasing power the last 100 years. The only reason the US dollars seemingly is stable is because you salary, mortage and products you buy are nominated in the same currency. I use NOK and PHP for my day to day currencies. Both fluctuate wildly against the US dollar. Is it the US dollar that fluctuates or is it NOK? I don't know, there is no way to tell, its relative. If I had my salary, mortgage and expenses in Bitcoin it would be as calm as the blue ocean. The rest of the world on the other hand would seem to be crashing down with hysteric rallies. The mechanics of this is such that there can never ever be stability, ever. There can be less volatility as bitcoin has grown much bigger. Right now bitcoin is a baby. Babies grow fast and unpredictable, shouting and screaming until they taper off and find their place. Bitcoin needs to grow up and find its place. Then there might be somewhat stability. Don't expect this to happen before christmas, or next year, or the year after that. We are talking a decade. Once bitcoin have deep, liquid and functioning derivatives and futures marketS with a lot of participants it can have somewhat of a stability. This will pave the way for nominating debt in bitcoin, which will bring even more stability.

If the person who loaned the money should not repay it, who should? It is a pretty adult thing to do to be economically responsible and really think deep and hard before you sign documents that will indebt you and your familiy for the next 20-30 years. Maybe it would have been smart and safe to buy a house that was a little bit smaller? I have always been prudent and made only safe choices so that i am sure i can fullfill my obligations. Now im dragged down into the mud because of irresponsible morons who dont know how to use a calculator figuring out the interest and what they really sign on. People who never should have owned a house got to buy one and for Spain its just the day of reconing. Feel bad for the kids that will be stuck in that nightmare, but for the grownups this is just adult education the hard way since they drove full speed into the future with blindfolds on. The next generation of people will be just like the generation after the great depression in the US: Risk averse savers - which is exactly what an economy needs to actually become sustainable.

This is a pricing cartel. This will not work. Even if you got every single bitcoiner in the world to sign up for this eventually (and eventually is very relative here as we are probably talking seconds) one of the sellers would want to sell their coins in front of everyone else. There is only one way to get in front of the que and that is to sell it a little bit cheaper. So maybe one guy sells for 999. Quickly the entire thing collapses sellers trying to underbid each other. They will under bid up until such a point where its not profitable / desirable to sell at such a price any longer. This is where supply meets demand. This is what a civilized market refers to as 'the market price'. Bitcoin will never be traded at anything else than market price. I'm willing to wager every single bitcoin I own on this so you can save yourselves the calories of this feeble attempt to fix the price. This have been tried countless of times in the real world in thousands of different configurations, not one single cartel last for more than a tiny period of time. The participants themselves makes it collapse.

I am so tired of people claiming that stability is important. There can be no stability until bitcoins can facilitate meaningfull transactions. By meaningfull i mean something simple as the price of a new car, or a house. If me and you today agree that you will buy my car with bitcoins and you then have to purchase $150.000 worth of bitcoins it would create huge swings in the price. And thats just one person. Before any kind of stability can occur the volume and price must come far far up so that larger individual transactions will not even show up as a blip. Ive been trading stocks and commodities for over 20 years, stability has never been a concern for me or other traders at any point.

50 can happen, its where the rally started. Markets often retrace important price-points to "check" if the rally was warranted before continuing on an even stronger rally.

The market price creates a graph. This graph is the result of a continual process of price discovery. What is the correct price at a given point in time? The market participants cant talk to each other so they have to "talk" through the price. The price of a currency or commodity can never be "stable". The participants test price levels to try to discover what the other participants think of a price level. This manifests itself in various trading patterns that individually don't dictate the price but signal to participants when the price is too high/low. For the last few days such a pattern (which happens all of the time) emerged, a triangle. For everybody who trades bitcoin actively this was easy to see. For people who cant talk 'graphs' its like standing clueless when the price drops a little because everybody yells "price is going to go down" in French, and you don't speak French. I cannot say if the price will go up or down, but i could say with 90% accuracy that when the price broke on the downside of the triangle the price would go down. There are dozens, maybe hundreds, of people sitting watching for such patterns. When they see it they act. What may look like a coordinated order execution is just when a lot of participants come to the same conclusion more or less simultaneously.
I'm sure if you analyse the trade logs you will see me and a lot of other independent traders selling in a very short timespan. There is no need for conspiracies, this is how things work.

I think you should visit. It is one of the least corrupt countries on the face of the planet. The crime rates are _EXTREMELY_ low. I will bet you will never see a police man or customs inspector during your entire visit. It is exceedingly safe to stay here, typically there is one murder a year and that is big news. That is exceptional for a country with 6 million people. The same goes for any sort of violent crimes like rape, robbery etc. Its basically non existent. And there is not a lot of police, and you will not see a single security guard in the malls or anywhere else. It just turns out that when you have a country with such economic freedoms people will get rich, its never unemployment and salaries are good. There is no need for violence any longer.

Well, you never know what the future will bring. You bought post china crash, but it seems that this was mostly by chance, according to you it is absolutely the same what point you go all in once you have decided to do so. I say it is not. If you operate by this logic you might just as well have bought everything at 1240. I would say its entirely uncertain if it would not go lower at this point. I'm not saying it will happen, but it would be a surprise at this point that it would test the previous high before continuing the rally, that means a dive to around 266. Should it break 266, oh my, it could easily retest 32. You come back then and say its not smart to have a few thousand in cash. It is literally impossible to hit the top or bottom consistently. With bitcoins volatility the chances of going all in at an intermediate top would leave you with less coins than evening out and sitting with cash buying at perceived bottoms. Now, if you have a die hard conviction that bitcoin is the future and it will never stop going up, then it does not matter when you buy. Regular people doing large investments however tend to lose their sleep at night if their investment go from 1200 to 400 in one week. You are free to do this. I would not do this.

The bitcoin part is doable, how to handle the other currency (USD/EUR etc) is very difficult. USD/EUR are digital currencies that needs to be in an account that somebody own. If the trades are intended to be realtime or close to the fiat currencies will have to be readily available. Maybe its not possible to have this completely decentralized on an individual bases but that all of the bitcoin exhanges can somehow create settlement pools and joint bid/ask pools. Just having the entire thing working with dozens of exchanges working together will make the system much more robust. It does however require a great deal of trust and security.

I guess: its going to be a struggle to reach 32 but once it reaches 32 it will trigger a massive rally that will bring the price up to something in the range of 64 +-. The price will correct after this back to an absolute low of around 18 (hopefully not that low). After the bottom it will climb quickly again to somewhere between 32 and the new all time high and be there until a new euphoric rally begins that will take the price well past 100...

It is faaar from the same. If i purchase gold for my bitcoins i will have gold, not bitcoins. If bitcoins had backing at one ounce of gold per coin the price per coin would at minimum be the price of an ounce of gold. Multiple custodians would trade coins with ounces regardless of the market price of either. So even if something insane were to happen to the market price you would still be able to go to the custodian and claim an ounce for every coin. This is backing, me buying gold is not. Backing is like the USD used to be where you could go with your paper note and exchange it for a fixed amount of gold no matter the price of either gold or dollars. It is this mechanism that made the USD the worlds reserve currency in the first place. Backing is an incredibly powerful thing for a currency, central banks loathe it because it limits all of their actions, but for bitcoins it would be dynamite.

If this happens the banks will fuck the governments over in a spectacular manner. The banks are paramount to the governments deficit spending. The bail outs are the banks government issued insurance policy to accept buying the junk debt the government issues. If this insurance policy is revoked the banks will go back to old style ultra prudent banking. That leaves the government with only two choices: stop deficit spending or break every rule and monotize debt directly themselves. Either option will be great for the economy. One will reign in insanely big governments the other will show the public how irresponsible government really is. I hope they pass these bail-ins into law as soon as possible.

The paper trail is easy to get rid of: 
1. Move your coins from one bitcoin account to another. Do this on a public computer.
2. Print proof of purchase / entire paper trail from fiat to your original bit coin account.
3. Bring everything to the police station and file a report of theft.
4. Declare the coins stolen in your accounts accompanied with the police report.
5. Taxman will accept this and you can probably deduct the loss as well.
6. Sell coins through localcoins or order a bunch of anonymous visa cards that you can fill up with bitcoin and make a bunch of ATM withdrawals every month with. You can even take a holiday to a country which allows tourists to open bank accounts, create a USD account with online banking access. Travel home. Register a fully verified mtgox account in your name, withdraw funds every month to your offshore account. Only transfer home an amount below your countries money laundering trigger sum each month. Transfers from an account in your name to an account in your name should not ring a single bell anywhere, even if the originating account is abroad. You can also buy physical gold with your coins and sell this at a local bullion market for cash.

Its completely transparent and more or less deterministic.
There are 12,090,350 bitcoins in existence. 25 new every 10 minutes. The last coin will be mined around the year 2140.
The mining race is slightly ahead of itself. The network self adjust converging at one new block every 10 minutes.  But the hashing power have gone up much faster than the network have been able to adjust to so right now we are a few years early. If this continues the last coin will be found maybe in 2130 instead of 2140.

Not a big problem. Every time a block is found the miners "sign" the transactions they want to (regularly the ones with the highest fee) and embed them to the blockchain. Right now there is a limit how big a chunk of data they can add to the blockchain. I dont know the figure but say its like 256kb or 1Mb or something. Basically everybody have to agree on a bigger block size so there is room for even more transactions per block. This limit have already been increased once before without a hiccup so I don't think this is something to worry about.

Think of the bitcoin client (qt and others) as a bit torrent client, they only share one single file, the blockchain. They simply mirror and propagate this file throughout the network and makes sure everybody is sharing the same file. The mining software is there only to _add_ new data to the blockchain file. Miners verify and add. Clients mirror and propagate. By running the qt client you help the network by adding one more node that store and maintains the blockchain.

Economic freedom is not stupid, its probably the most important freedom of all. There is pretty good empirical evidence that a prosperous people and (in aggregate) countries are much more prone to being open minded and forgiving than poorer countries. If you take time to read a few books on socionomics you will find ample statistical evidence when a country for example is most likely to do such acts as: debt forgiveness, forgive prior atrocities from neighbour countries, ask for forgiveness and reconciliation from neighbouring countries, sign peace treaties, sign disarmament treaties etc. Almost exclusively such actions are taken in times of great (relative) prosperity. On the opposite side you will have countries that have been prosperous and have turned poor. These countries will automatically start stuggling with issues like: racism, growth of national socialism, singling out ethnical groups / economic /religious groups to blame for the recent downturn. Almost every single major war have been started as a direct result of lack of economic freedom that leads to some sort of economic setback that again leads to social disorder. Look at Europe in the past and today and say that is not the case. The simplest way to achieve peace over time is to strictly enforce economic freedoms and consequently refuse special interest groups special benefits or rules. Europe today is a complete cesspool when it comes to special interest groups. It is no accident that on the freedom index EU is only represented with one single country in the top 10 list. Compared to what is needed to exit the crises there is way too little economic freedom in Europe today.

I subscribe to the idea that the government have a role, just much more clearly defined than now, and much much smaller:
The police should protect life and property from internal threats.
The military should protect life and property from internal and external threats.
The police takes orders from the courts.
The politicians can only _suggest_ laws to the courts, not pass them into law themselves.
The courts can only ratify laws that are not in conflict with the constitution.
The militarily's highest goal is to protect the constitution.
It is the distribution of power in such a way that can create stability. The constitution must be simple and easy to read for everybody and 100% written to protect the individual against aggression in all forms. 
If one branch tries to corrupt or gain more power the other branches must react and rectify. Politicians will in effect lose incredibly much of their power, if not all, because they cannot pass any laws themselves just suggest and argue in the courts why something should be added to the constitution. If the constitution is written according to the non-aggression principle and individual rights of freedom and peaceful interactions there are not so many laws that its possible to create that are in compliance. I think we will see this on the internet first when the first online "states" emerges.

What you are describing is what i think of as a sentiment reset. It is not possible for the price to go up all the time, at one point "everybody" is on board the bitcoin train and when everybody is on board who will then drive the price up further? At this point any minor news or detail will cause a stampede to get off the train. The price goes down. All the über positive sentiment is crushed and reset. Once the sentiment reaches a point where very few people are positive the upward trend begins again. This is pretty standard, we are herd animals and like to run in flock what ever direction we run in.

This is not a get rich scheme just so you know. This is the mass adoption of a new global payment system that will transform into a global store of value and then to a global currency. It can go good, it can go horribly bad. The insane price increases are based on the continually and strong belief that "_in the future_ bitcoin will become a huge player in global trade". As this future becomes more and more certain speculators will bring the pricing information from the future into the present. If _anything_ goes wrong with bitcoin the price will go to zero in just about 10 seconds. I'm referring to ex. if a vulnerability is found in the algorithms, some weakness is discovered in the hashing functions, weakness in the cryptography. Other than those big issues the community can change the protocol to fix minor issues. If you can live with the risk it is _not_ to late to get involved in bitcoin. The price is the only unyielding factor that can change to accommodate growth. If you want the most out of your experience its almost mandatory to educate yourself thoroughly about the workings of bitcoin. This is not just fun to know, its almost required if you intend not to lose your coins at this point. It is fun and empowering. Highly recommended.

I would not buy one except if it was worth more for me in the present than the future. That means that people would not buy a lot of needless fluff with pretence that they might as well do so because their money would be worth less in the future. If people actually bought only what they needed and/or companies would _have_ to produce stuff that is worth more in the present than the future for people. It is _no_ accident that inventions like television, cars, airplanes, skyscapers, telephone, railroad travel etc was invented/commercialized in the US in the years under the gold standard. All of these products were so _fantastic_ that it really made people open their wallets even though they knew they would get more in the future. Innovation at such a pace have not been seen since the FED took over. I would argue that ever since FIAT was introduced we have just seen minor refinements of what was already invented to make people buy the newest model even it would not be necessary. If the gold standard had been allowed to persist we would undoubtedly have space tourism, autonomous cars etc etc a long time ago.

No, i did not leave that out. If you notice i actually said that it worked good until 1913 when the federal reserve was founded. In effect the US partially went away from the gold standard at this point. The federal reserve did a horrible mistake: They allowed the banks to use fractional reserve banking lending out a lot more dollars than there were physical paper dollars / gold to back it with. All the debt conjured into existence were redeemable in paper dollars / gold which meant there grew to become a huge disparity between debt, paper dollars and backing. This first led to a "minor" crises in 1921 and then a huge crises in 1929-. This is very easy to understand. The gold was the backing, the amount of physical paper dollars were limited by the amount of backing, fractional reserve banking increased the money supply by a tenfold. When the crises hit everybody wanted to convert their bank account debt created "vaporware" dollars into physical bills which could be exchanged for gold. This resulted in massive runs on the banks draining them completely for all cash. The debt however was left intact, everybody held on to their cash for their dare lives grinding the economy to a complete standstill. Its easy to prove that this is what actually happened: Check out this document: 
This document contains the price of gold in USD from 1850 - present. Look how the goldprice is rock table from 1850 to 1913. From 1913 the market understands that something funny is going on, even though the dollar is supposed to be on a 100% gold reserve backing the price of gold priced in USD increases. It is completely illogical that this happened, why would anybody give _more_ dollars for an ounce of gold than the federal reserve was guaranteeing? Because a lot of people knew the guarantee was starting to being hollowed out and a lot of people would be left hanging when the bubble burst. The federal reserve intentionally destroyed the gold standard in a carefully orchestrated assassination leaving the public to believe the gold standard was dangerous leaving them in charge of monetary policy thereafter. You can notice the same thing happening from the mid 60'ies until 1971 when bretton woods was really burried. The US have defaulted on the gold standard twice.
Just so i dont sound like one of those anti-fractional reserve banking loonies: There is _nothing_ wrong with fractional reserve banking in a free market. We will see fractional reserve banking applied to bitcoins in the future. The tiny difference being that there will be a differentiation between demand deposits and interest generating deposits. Demand deposits are deposits that are readily available for withdrawal at instant notice. Interest generating deposits are backed by debt and you have to wait for the debt to be repaid before being able to withdraw. Had the banks during the roaring twenties made such a distinction the crises would have been averted.

I find aequitas very fitting, all coins are equal, all holders are equal from the perspective of the protocol. None of the holders of bitcoins are "more equal than others" which is the case of holders of FIAT currencies. It is as you say "equal opportunity". I know the word "equality" have been raped by the socialists, they mean it in the sense that you will forcefully take from the productive and redistribute to the unproductive so everybody will have equal wealth. I find that barbaric. The best a properly civilized society can ever hope for is that everybody is being treated equal in the eyes of the law which means no arbitrary redistribution but equal opportunity to influence your life. I think the protocol of the bitcoin currency force people to behave civilized and treat each other as equals. If two parties that are going to do a trade don't feel they both gain from the trade it will not happen. No arbitrary taxes, fees, tolls, unions, duties or anything else to enrich one party on behalf of another. Bitcoin is truly the great equalizer enabling the worlds poor to work in a globalized economy on equal terms.

I dont think i need to do anything. Backing will emerge as a consequence of a free market. What do you think would happen if tomorrow some billionaire simply forked off a new blockchain and said that every single coin in this chain had a 100% backing in a basket of gold, oil, steel, wheat and whatnot. Would merchants prefer to accept a currency that provably could be exchanged for a lot of goods or a currency that could not be exchanged for anything. What would be the safest store of value? The value of the backing would not become _the_ value, but the minimum value of the currency. When more competitors arise that wants to compete with bitcoin's dominance backing and securitization will be the first tools. For mature financial institutions such networks of trust is very important and will tip the scales on which currencies to use and endorce. Im really looking forward seeing how this turns out, i love bitcoin, but i see trouble far ahead if the currency does not adapt to competition that is surely to come on strong as this technology goes mainstream. Id hate to see bitcoin turning into BetaMax.

Case 1: Wrong.
Banks can leverage up, we will see fractional reserve bitcoin banking once the market is more mature. The way this would work is that banks will offer two types of accounts: demand deposit accounts and interest yeilding accounts. Demand deposit accounts are available to withdraw from at zero notice and will probably come with a very slight negative interest rate (you pay for your bank to keep your coins safe). Then there would be interest generating accounts. The interest on these accounts comes from companies the bank lends to. These accounts you will commit to over time and you will not be able to withdraw at moments notice (maybe with a huge penalty). From an accounting point of view the coins deposited at interest would be an asset both for you and the same coins will be an asset for the company who loaned them. Those IOU's will be traded and handled as real bitcoins in a secondary market, at a risk adjusted price obviously. It will be a normal obligation / bond market, and it will artificially increase the number of coins available because people will actually start accepting the IOS's as settlement for trades. When this occurs it will dampen a little bit of the deflationary upwards pressure. Think: right now all the hoarded coins are efectively removed from the economy artificially limiting the moneysupply. Once these coins are available to loan they will enter the economy and be in "active duty" chasing goods and services. This will put a downward pressure on the exchange rate because more coins are available in the market. I dont excpect to see this happening soon as it requires a great deal of securitization, trust and legal binding contracts before it happens. We will not se banks with levels of leverage like today, it will be much less. A good and secure bank wil probably go 1:2. If any bank goes too far it is extremely likely a competitor will attemt a hostile takeover through a run on the bank. If you want to learn more about this i suggest reading more on the gold standard. Everything possible under a gold standard is possible under bitcoins.
In your second example i can only identify two people, A and B. It seems like B have agreed to an impossible contract. Does this example have any relevance in the real world?

Just to clarify a little: A monopoly is a right given by a government protecting a specific entity against competition. If somebody tries to produce or sell given product the government will use violence to protect the monopoly. To say the least there is no authority with such powers with bitcoin. That means that your phrase, monopoly, have to be substituted with 'market dominance'. What would happen if somebody dominated the bitcoin market? To answer this you only have to ask yourself: what could a company or individual possibly do to gain market dominance in a free market? They would have to petsistantly deliver something of _great_ value to the other market participants. The value would have to be so big that everybody cant stop themselves from using the services provided by the dominator. What ever that might be would undoubtfully be good for the bitcoin economy. This situation would also incentivise competitors immensely, the dominator can clearly overcharge and just the thought of all the riches available if they can beat the dominator will attract scores of competitors. In time this will drive down prices and comoditize the entire business enabling the next leap.

Micro transactions will happen just perfectly. But there needs to be some kind of bitpay / coinbase company that facilitates for this.

Although there are capital controls in Iraq i'm sure the local government will allow companies there to pay their bills to foreign creditors. He should incorporate a new company (he probably already got one), capitalize it up with his cash. He should do the same in Canada and start sending plausible invoices from his Canadian company to transfer the money over time.
Other than that i'm sure there is a thriving market for gold in Iraq, stack up on jewelry and repeatedly travel back and fourth to Dubai which have a thriving gold market and little or none capital controls. 
Third option: Find a medium sized western company that does operations in Iraq. They will need dollars locally for payroll expenses. Broker a deal through a trusted third party in the west where he will give them cash in Iraq and they will give him the same amount of cash in US/Canada.
With the sums of money involved im sure that greasing somebody with a few percent will open a lot of doors.

I don't know how many times it needs to be said. Bitcoin _cannot_ stabilize. There are extremely few coins. The inflation rate is predictable and slow. Every single person who wants to get a hold of or sell a bitcoin will influence the price. The price is the only variable in the entire equation that can move. A lot of the value of bitcoin is not in the present, but in the future. This means the price of bitcoin will be volatile for a long time. There is no way around this. The price will not stabilize in any way or form before a) The price is much, much higher b) there is deep liquidity c) there is a functioning futures, derivatives and debt market for bitcoin. Then you will see stability. 
I LOVE bitcoin. I have been involved since early 2010. But its not not a currency. It cannot be called a currency in any way or form before things are natively priced in bitcoin. Right now nothing is priced in bitcoin, everything is priced in USD and then converted to bitcoin. Bitcoin cannot function as a currency until goods and services are priced in bitcoin.
The volatility is not a challenge i think. It may be too much for the faint hearted, but since its so easy to price things in USD and just display the corresponding BTC price online thats what we have to live with for now.

I would just like to point out it is clear from what you write you have not completely grasped the entire concept. A custodian that "executes" the backing have no interest in either bitcoins or for example gold. They have been given the backing medium (gold) for free only with instructions to exchange this with bitcoins at a fixed ratio. If the price of bitcoins go to zero and people come to exchange the worthless coins with gold they will do so. The gold would have to come from the community itself. The most likely method this would be done is if exchanges used a tiny portion of their commission fee to purchase bullion. Periodically they would distribute bullion to multiple custodians in multiple countries. With each deposit they would increase the backing ratio. The minimum price of bitcoins would slowly rise to reflect the underlying backing. If the price of coins go below the price of the backing asset people would start buying bitcoins like crazy to exchange it for the underlying asset, the purchasing would increase the price back to or above the value of the backing. Since it is completely illogical that the price should go below the price of the backing the custodians can always use the bit coins received to purchase new backing. The entire goal of the backing is to provide a intrinsic value for our coins, something they can be exchanged to in a safe country no matter what happens. If an exchange started such a scheme it would be my preferred place of business any day. Once bitcoins really catch on i am sure we will see multiple backing schemes emerging. It is the natural evolution of how a free market will drive through with incredible and irresistible force that this particular currency, though not backed by any government, is safer than anything seen before in the world of finance.
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:43:54
Are there more coins in existence now compared to 1 day ago? YES. By any logic the money supply is increasing every 10 minutes. You cant factor in the coins that have not been discovered. That is like saying that the price of gold factors in all the gold available on the planet. The price is set by what is available in the immediate present.
What does DEFLATION mean? If you have a balloon and deflate it it gets smaller. If you have a balloon and inflate it it gets bigger. If bitcoin is a monetary deflationary currency how did that work out from coin zero? We have gone from zero to 11.000.000 coins. How on this planet is this not inflation!? How can you possibly say the monetary supply is not increasing?

The backing does not need to be centralized. And if anybody decided they wanted to start backing bitcoins there is nothing you or anybody else could do to stop them. Bitcoins would be out competed by a clone or similar currency with backing. I find it difficult that this is not easy to fathom. If you are going to purchase say 1000 USD in cryptographic currency and you have a choice between one currency with backing and one without, all other things being equal, you have to have a dent in the head not to chose the one with backing. People will churn the "bitcoin doesn't need backing" phrase all the time, i don't think people have fully understood the implications and how this could work.

Of all the stocks listed at NYSE something like 70-80% are owned by various pension funds, they never move. A lot is owned by institutions as well which rarely move. Probably just around 5% of the stocks price the entire stock-market, it is easy to manipulate the thing to inflated prices. When the pension funds become net sellers instead of buyers it is going to be a bloodbath. For bitcoin this is different, just check ( The last 24 hours ~1.5 million bitcoins changed hands, this is low, I've seen much higher turnaround than this. Every single day between 15 and 25 percent of all the bitcoins in existence changes hands. That is a good velocity by my judgement and it also gives credit to that the price is correct, every single person that receives all these coins agree that the trade is fairly priced regardless if they are swapping them for fiat, labour or goods and services.

I don't think you have thought through completely how things like that would work in a free society. First would be that some sort of "zoning" would happen completely spontaneously, nobody would like to endanger themselves by buying a property that had any opening for somebody to build a factory next door. Land owners that would like to subdivide up their lots and sell them would require guarantees from the buyers what the lot should be used for. This method here is already wildly used in countries with no building regulation today, where i live there are dozens of beautifully planned subdivisions far away from any industrial zones. Nobody in their right mind will buy land without the proper paperwork / guarantees that no factories will be build anywhere close. Land owners even provide "bufferzones" around the lots they actually sell to isolate from noise and pollution. Secondly: Even if this happened a lot owner would have a legal claim against the factory owner. By building a factory next to his house the factory owner actually initiated an action that results in the direct loss of value the surrounding lots. A bare minimum compensation would be the original price - current value.
And just to continue: Today the government will give away rights to pollute accompanied by a "get out of jail free" card to big corporations. That means that a regular person have no claim what so ever if a corporation pollutes a lake, river, soil, sea or whatever. The corporations can just wave a piece of paper from the government that frees them for their responsibility. If any compensation is paid, its just token. And it happens all the time that corrupt bureaucrats issues certificates wrongly. In a free society governed by the non-aggression principle where peaceful interaction was the norm people would have a regular swiss army knife of laws to back them against corporations. You can be sure that no matter how poor you are there would always be more people with your concern to back you up or turbo lawyers that helps poor people for free/no cure no pay against corporations that ignores the rights of the individual. It is the rules and regulations of today that enables corporations and government to continue the pollution and unhealthy practices, the free market could never give the blessings the government issues daily.

I cannot understand why blockchain.info haven't enabled different kinds of accounts. Wallet for instant transfers. Regular account w/ 24 hour transfer delay and vault account with 1week transfer delay. You could keep 90% of your coins in the vault at all times. If you make a transaction from your vault you have answer 'yes' on email and SMS requests daily 7 days straight before the transaction goes through. This should be included in the protocol as well. Right now owning bitcoin is like driving a car with a knife between your chest and the stearing wheel - one slight bump and you're dead.

Advice if you are nervous. If you believe (like me) that the long term trend is up but you are nervous about buying into bitcoin at a short term peak the rational thing to do is to space out your purchases. If you divide what you intend to buy into ex 26 chunks then you can buy some coins every 14 days for a year. This will ensure that you will get a nice and even price for your coins and that any sudden drops or spikes are "filtered" out. The "problem" with this is that you have to have an iron will, investing takes a toll on your psychology and you will become incredibly tempted to just "buy everything at once" when you see the price go up and up. You can be sure that you are not alone thinking in this way and when everybody do that at more or less the same time the marked will get saturated at a peak with a corresponding correction after. 
For me the pudding is that there are so _incredible_ few coins, they are so rare that i'm literally shocked at the people who are willing to part with their precious coins at these low prices. We can laugh ourselves silly at the guy who bought a pizza for 10.000 BTC back in 2010, but in 2016 the relationship between that pizza and today's prices and today's prices and 2016 prices will be more or less the same. We will laugh of the people who mined and sweated and sold out for peanuts.

They are already relaxing on these laws. Look at the strict anti-gay laws for example. These used to be enforced in the past but now they are 'never' enforced any longer. Prostitution is legal and gay men / lady boys are selling sex completely openly. This would be unheard of a decade ago. The same goes for media, there is open criticism and bloggers are writing pretty much what they want without facing any backlash. I think its smart to look back on Singapores history to see these laws in perspective. After WW2 when Singapore declared independence, up until now, they were the small kid on the block with big neighbours detesting them. It would not had been possible for Singapore to survive at all in this political climate if the government did not control the media. If they let loose on this the governments of Malaysia and Indonesia would finance shell companies to set up in Singapore engaging in pure information warfare. A young nation like Singapore would not be able to withstand that at fragile times like that. The basic premise for Singapore have always been freedom, but faced with hostile neighbours they have had to pick and choose which freedoms to enable at what point. At the present there is vast economic freedom. The immigration policy have been _insanely_ liberal by any measurement, so much so that the country is now completely filled to the brim with immigrants from all over the world. Even after immigration restrictions are in place they have the fairest and most understandable immigration rules on the planet I would argue. Compared to the "feudal" system of Europe its a beacon of hope and freedom. I regularly take the Metro and go to the movies. I'm not bothered by the propaganda at all. It is mostly promoting that families should stick together and support each other, which I find positive. The army in Singapore needs to be strong and promoted, Malaysia and Indonesia are openly hostile towards Singapore and they are cesspools of corruption that desperately wants to discredit Singapores success.

Smart as this critique is I think he lacks a bit of imagination how this crypto-currency thing will play out. Bitcoin will only be one in a multitude of currencies which have different properties. Currencies will be made to compliment bitcoin and its shortcomings. For example there will be currencies that are completely anonymous, but which are bad stores of value. There will be currencies with instant verifiable transfers, but with a little bit less security. There will be currencies which pegs themselves to different kind of constants, like the price of commodities, average cost of labour, national currencies etc. to make it easy and safe to do contracts without currency risk.
Since everything is "just numbers" it will be close to cost free to move between these currencies. I think bitcoin, being the first, will become the gold standard of these crypto-currencies, the one where you keep your savings. You go temporarily into other currencies only to fulfil specific monetary goals and there will be apps that do the entire process completely transparent for you, like when you are going to pay for gas or buy drugs.

You can look at all markets that are mostly free to see this behavior. Typically in IT/electronics. IBM had a dominant position. Microsoft came to challenge and took the dominant position. Microsofts products were so good and cheap they were dominating the market completely for many years. But will always happen smeller, more agile competitors will always come along, just as Microsoft once were to IBM. Now Microsoft's dominance is fading quickly, in all areas they dominated before there are now better, cheaper alternatives. It's so serious for Microsoft I think they can be broke within 10 years if they don't adopt. Another example is Nokia, they dominated the mobile scene almost as much as Microsoft, they could not stand up against the competition that came along when everybody saw how profitable making mobiles were for them. Companies that had never before nibbled with mobile phone electronics could not resist investing in mobile phone production, like Samsung or Apple. I'm sure you can find hundreds of examples of companies that have invented nieces from scratch and then goes on to be run into the ground by a smaller competitor. Google did the same to Altavista from DEC. altavita was the first real search engine on the Internet, everybody used it, all of a sudden google launched and that was the last time you used Altavista. Competition favors the small over the big if there is no regulation that favors the big. Big companies have much higher costs to operate and adopt much slower to changes.

Not as rough as the drop from 32 to 1.8. The entire point of a meaningful correction is that the sentiment have to be completely crushed and "reset". Prices always rise on a wall of worry and peak on a euphoric belief that "it is now 100% sure that this is the next big thing". You cannot have a wall of worry unless the price corrects so low that most people turn negative. The easiest way to spot the peak is when everybody is in agreement that the value will go up up up. Right now most of the posts i read is that its a bubble, its a ponzi, its overvalued, the price will collapse and yet slowly but surely the price steadily increases. If im right soon the most negative people will change their stance and get a feeling of "if i don't buy now the bitcoin train will leave me, this shit is for real, i cant buy enough coins fast enough". You will see angry posts pointing fingers at ex international wire transfers not being fast enough and they feel angry for missing potential profits because of time delays. Once this happen we will see a blowout.
This is just the way it is, the origin of the price on any stock or commodity is fundamentally rooted in human beings and since we are animals with a herd mentality we tend to behave like a herd. Not so easy to predict exact prices or timing but sometimes its possible to read the sentiment and have some kind of prediction. I might be 100% wrong of cause, this is just my subjective "feeling" on what state/stage the marked is in now.

The fight for political power is the fight to gain control over the "monopoly of violence". Only the government is sanctioned to inflict violence onto the public. With bitcoin the protocol itself is the "monopoly of violence". You are free to discard or embrace it, but if you embrace it you submit to its rules. The rules build into the bitcoin protocol are the ideal rules for us humans to operate under: Free market capitalism without arbitrary taxation, rules or regulation. It does not matter what political direction you are leaning against, by using bitcoin you embrace the essence of civilized behavior. This is exactly the reason bitcoin will explode and take over, every human being on the face of the planet will embrace this, we are genetically programmed to for private ownership and fairness. The ownership of your coins is absolute. The only possible way you will voluntarily part with your coins is of your own free will. This means that any trade nominated in bitcoin have to be mutually beneficial for both buyer and seller. Bitcoin have the potential to launch the human species to the next level. Move over statists, bitcoin will show that voluntarism, peace and cooperation will crush your ideas and warmongering.

Didn't watch too much, annoying debate. Bitcoin is currently not a currency, but it can become one. Its so simple: Bitcoin cannot be called a currency before goods and services are priced in Bitcoin. Right now everything is priced in USD and converted to what that the corresponding bitcoin value is. Its not a currency until the pricing is nominated in bitcoin without looking at or referring to anything else. I love bitcoin, but we can't really call it a currency if it doesn't have the properties of a currency.

If the price is "wrong" / undervalued there is no limit on how re-pricing might manifest itself. But being mere humans without godlike abilities prices tend to overshoot in such cases and will fall back to the "right" price. So if 100 is the real, objective and real price based on demand you can be sure it would go way past 100 in a speculative boom before stabilizing at 100. That said I have full faith that current prices are not overshoot prices. There are waaay to few coins and too many people interested in those coins. Also add steadily increasing interest from hedge funds, venture capitalists and affluent investors. The current market cap is incredibly low compared to the underlying potential.

I don't think 5-20 Million would make them insolvent, much less trigger a liquidity crises. It is to me quite obvious there must a reason they have stalled for _all_ withdrawals. If they are 5-10 million short it should still be business as usual, not every single client they have will withdraw at once. Running at 90% reserve for 6-12 months while recovering is surely not an issue. This smells much more like AML problems where they are trying to come in compliance before they can continue withdrawals.

Bitcoin is a margin revolution for businesses. Right now retailers who accept visa/mastercard are struggling to earn enough money while visa/mastercard, doing nothing, are able to achieve bigger margins on what is sold than the retailers themselves. If you are a high volume retailer today the profit margin can be as low as 0,5-2%. At the same time Visa/Mastercard charge 2-5% just to process payment. By accepting bitcoin you can improve your margin substantially and use this advantage for profit, growth or competition. These low margins have forced online retailers into large business units so the volume can be high enough on these low margins to survive. If adoption is widespread Bitcoin will re-enable smaller retailers to compete with bigger retailers obtaining higher margins. This competition will in turn force even the biggest retailers into accepting bitcoin as payment.

People would typically put currency in a bank for security and interest. There are more reasons but those are the two biggest. The interest rates would defiantly not be negative. Remember there is not an unlimited amount of money which can be pulled out of the hat here. There is huge competition from companies who want to borrow money to leverage their operation to gain profits faster. The interest rates would be bid up by the most successful companies. The more effective, optimized, streamlined and innovative the company, the higher the profit. Larger profit enables paying more in interest enabling you to borrow money at the expense of less competitive companies. Always remember, there is a finite amount of physical resources, a productive and functioning society result in the resources being used rationally and not for party party and war like today. The availability of cheap debt enables the casino to outbid the producer of ambulances for the steel used in production. This will never happen under a deflationary currency, the people will vote with their wallets always guiding resources to where they are needed the most. Just wait, you will see this beginning happening in the bitcoin economy too, the first contour of this is the capitalization of the ASIC companies, everybody is voting with their wallets providing an insane amount of security for the currency. Expect much more investment by the bit coiners in infrastructure.
Consumer debt would be non existent, as it was during the entire period of the gold standard. Individuals cannot compete with the productivity of well run corporations, the interest rates would always be out of reach of regular people. This is a good thing, people will own their stuff outright and not be debt slaves.
Just to add: There would probably be negative interest rates on demand deposits. Like there is on gold today if you store it in a vault. Like goldmoney or bullionvault.

I can tell you the historic reason for Singapore press freedom "problem". I think its pretty important to look at things in the perspective of why this policy was introduced. After WW2 when Singapore declared independence its was, to say the least, popular in Malaysia. Indonesia as well was not happy with this. You have a city state smaller than the little toe of two gigantic, angry, militarily strong neighbours. What happened is that just after declaring independence those big, angry neighbours threatened to invade. I'm not aware of all the specifics, but they didn't. What they did to were to use subterfuge and propaganda. The Malay government funded newspapers in Singapore with the sole purpose to undermine the Singapore government. The Indonesians too. The Singaporeans did not want to use such means, im quite use, but basically it was war. I can tell you that up until this day im quite convinced that if the Singaporeans opened up the floodgates the Malay would use this possibility to create as much trouble as humanly possible in Singapore. There is no love lost, the Singaporeans have disgraced the Malay government in every way: The growth in Singapore is stellar, in Malaysia they are still rock poor, the malay cant even clean their own fresh water but have to export their water to Singapore which cleans it for them and sell it back. They are like cat and dog. That said i think Singapore is so powerful now in the region that they can for the first time withstand their big neighbours. Singapore is so rich now that i think the Singaporean newspapers could dominate in Malaysia and Indonesia if they wanted to.

The energy flowed because of the economic and social system allowed it too, not the other way around. Look at several counties in Africa today, they have huge reserves but are unable to get the oil up even though the technology is dirt cheap and readily available. They have not embraced capitalism and rule of law resulting in near anarchy conditions which leaves the oil exactly where it is - in the ground. The crown example of this is North Korea, it is so incredibly rich in natural resources it drips, yet people are dying from hunger. The exponential growth the US experienced was the direct result of the gold standard, capitalism and the rule of law that created a economic environment brining out the best in people.

Early adopters funnels money into developing bitcoin products and services that in turn will enable  super good online transaction services. Good examples are the vast amount of money invested in hardware miners, developing merchant tools, hardware wallets etc. All of this is funded by the speculators.

My guess: Early stage euphoria, 2nd of 3 legs, first leg was the peak in 2011. The current price is not high enough over the last peak for this to be finished yet, would expect to see 150-200℅ gain over previous peak before major correction. Just wait for the third leg, those can be spectacular.

Im defiantly not nonsensical. I understand everything you have written 100% but based on what you write i can say with the same amount of certainty that you have not understood what i have been writing. Backing from anything, commodity/currency/energy would provide a serious base value to bitcoin. Why do you think the USD became the world reserve currency in competition with every other currency on earth? It was chosen because of its gold and silver backing. People trust physical backing more than anything. By combining the extremely good properties of bitcoin with the equally favourable properties of for example a basket of gold/silver/oil/wheat and whatnot bitcoin would gain mainstream acceptance and trust much faster and greater than without backing.

Fuck the death penalty for drugs, its is actually possible to live a life in relative freedom in Singapore. Just simple things are actually legal: Chose my own hospital and doctor.

Backing means that the custodian would exchange for example gold to you at the comparable amount of gold in their holding compared to amount of bitcoins you come with _regardless_ of the market price of bitcoins. That means that even if the price went to zero your coins would still be able to be exchanged at the custodian.

That is true, but the US economy was the only one that enabled these things to become common and commercialized first. I believe to have read that both electricity and telephony was invented much earlier in Europe. But why did not these great inventions get rolled out to the general public? The economic structure itself put a stop to it making larger scale deployment of new technology hard / impossible. It was the US that first deployed all the great inventions successfully at first becoming the "gold standard" making it easy for the world to follow. This is also why US brands, even to this date, is so highly valued. This is cultural, technological and economic inertia. To this date the US economy is the most innovative and productive. It is not an accident that the internet originated in the US and was commercialized and made available to the public. I think it is difficult to overstate how incredible successful the US have been because of its roots of capitalism, rule of law and strong individual rights. Its just in the last 50-60 years or so the machinery have gotten some real bad medicine which have started to produce stranger and stranger results. Bitcoins are a direct response to this. Bitcoins are an attempt to introduce the same good mechanisms that enabled the US to flourish in the first place in form of a protocol, no wonder its really popular.

Since this is your first time, make it simple:
1. Buy a Yubikey
2. Create online wallet at blockchain.info
3. Create really good password + secondary password. These should both be passwords you don't use _anywhere_ else.
4. Pair your account with your Yubikey.
5. Thoroughly test that you can log in and out with all passwords.
6. Buy a few coins.
7. Test again and again that everything works. Transfer a little bit back and forth to get the hang of it. Never ever write addresses by hand. Always copy / paste or QR codes. Always check the first four and last four characters in an address before sending coins that everything is correct.
8. Buy more coins first when you feel comfortable you know what you are doing. A lot of people manages to lose their coins because of sloppyness and incompetence.

Deregulation is 100% the answer. To start a bank today you have to be in compliance with 80.000 pages of rules and regulations. If you think that if the government could create just 20.000 pages more of regulation and then it would work you are wrong.
You known why those banks have so big buildings? Because they are filled with lawyers working day and night so the bank does nothing illegal. The absolutely biggest expense for banks are legal matters. At this point it is nearly impossible to compete with them because it costs so much to be in compliance. Smaller banks can not be profitable in this scenario so they are all broke or bought by bigger banks. This consolidation caused the entire 'too big to fail' concept. We need to go back to basic in banking: market set interest rates and you go broke if you fuck up. Depositors need to become much more vigilant when it comes to their money. Banking is a far to important function to be regulated by government.

Thing with bitcoin is that it really isn't assigned to a specific model. Bitcoin is a product of the free market (yes, such a thing is possible in cyberspace). There is no guide, template or known answers in advance how this thing will turn out. Its an experiment. Most interesting i find that the government have told for ages that currency is so big, difficult and important to organize that they have to be in charge of its issuance and control. Now we have a perfectly working thing here that i dare say solves the currency problem more elegant, predictable and safe than any government have ever done / will do. That is sexy.

The more people keep their coins, the more it drives up the purchasing power of the ones in circualtion. The ones in circualtion will (to a large degree) be used to fund bitcoin related projects.

I think the "when" is given on a long enough timescale. There is a 100/100 depreciation to zero empirical record for FIAT currencies so far historically. The big question is when is when? It is quite obvious that the US dollar is a strong currency, there is no currency on earth with more debt nominated in it than the USD. Many of these loans run into decades and even a century of down payment time. It is clear there is going to be huge, _huge_ demand for USD in decades to come just because of this simple fact. They can print quite a lot without denting the purchasing power, i think this has already been established. Then you have the contra information, for every dollar the US government spend 41 cents is deficit spending financed by monetizing debt. That is quite shocking to say the least. How long can this go on until these two forces meet and what happens when they do? Markets have a tendency to factor in future information into the present quite aggressively, as we can see with bitcoin.

I hear that people say that this is a restriction, im not so sure. Look at every country which have had political or monetary issues, the people themselves immediately starts using barter and alternative currencies to avoid the madness. Even in the soviet union, a completely totalitarian society, alternate means of trade was the only thing keeping the thing afloat. People used food, clothes, dollars, light bulbs and shoes as money instead of the government scrip. Even the people working in government had to use alternate means of trade to get what they wanted. In Cuba the USD is more worth than the locally issued money, this is the case in many many countries around the globe. I don't think it matters in the least what the government rules on bitcoin, if people want to use this they will use it, period. Prohibition don't work at all against drugs, prostitution, alcohol, piracy or anything else and it will certainly not work for something as attractive as the most sleek and super sexy way of transferring money ever invented. I have a suspicion that the government will not lift a finger trying to stop or limit bitcoin. Doing so would only show that their power is extremely limited. They have more or less stopped trying to limit online piracy as well. I think they know very well what the alternative is: Everybody switching to TOR, and they would really hate that so they just ignore online piracy instead of slamming down hard. It is the same for bitcoin, they really can't do anything so they will avoid losing face over this and pray and hope that it will fail under its own weight. If anything we will see government orchestrated cyber attacks against the protocol / network / exchange price.

The backer have no economic interest. They are just custodians. This is not difficult to understand, did you even read my post? The backer have not paid anything for the gold, they are just given the gold to store safely and to exchange it if any holder of bitcoins want to. Just like you could exchange your paper dollars for gold before 1971. It is a proven and good method to providing an absolutely secured physical value to a currency. It was the most common way a currency worked before FIAT came into existence.

There is a reason bitcoins are cheaper at BTC-E than other exchanges. Its much harder to deal with, in my eyes you are really gambling with your money. If its a lot of money i would be really careful at this point. Buy back your coins and redeem them to your own personal wallet until you have figured out how to withdraw them hassle free. As long as you are verified there is no problem withdrawing from MtGox and they are fast. If you dont want to sit in bitcoin you can have as many dollars you want in an unverified mtgox account too.

Deflation bashing is a sure sign of a person which is lacking in economic competence and history. Two major blows to their argumentation would be:
1. The US Gold Standard.
Basically from 1785-1913, almost 250 years, the US was on a pure gold standard. A gold standard is very similar / identical to the absolutely limited supply of bitcoins. Now, what happened in these 250 years? Chaos, disorder, collapse? No! On the contrary the US economy grew to be the most powerful, productive, wealthy, diversified, innovative and fairest economy in the history of the world. In this single period of human history the US economy invented, mass produced and made available for the general public: Electricity, Telephony, Airplanes, Railroads, Skyscrapers, Automobiles, Cinema, Radio and much much more. The rest of the world literally stood with their feet planted in a potatoefield looking in awe at what capitalism and the gold standard did for the citizens of the US. Never before in the history of the world had an economy progressed so incredibly fast and robustly. Never before had the wealth been more distributed. "Everybody" could afford electricity, travel, a television set, a radio, a car etc. This was completely unheard of. This is the reason for mass immigration from all over the world - everybody wanted to take part in this miracle. And _everything_ happened on a purely deflationary currency. An ounce of gold saved in 1785 increased its purchasing power all the way until 1913. Its simple to understand: A fixed amount of gold was used to purchase a fixed amount of the entire economy which grew and grew and grew. Why did this work so incredibly well?
2. The mechanism.
It is simple to understand why a deflationary currency is far superior to an inflationary one. The result i described in my fist point, the mechanism is as follows:
It is completely right as the deflation-mongers point out that a deflationary currency will bias the population to save and not consume.
Savings is the cornerstone of any economy. Savings instead of consumption = underconsumption. Savings means that people accumulate capital in banks. Banks will offer interest on the deposits. The interest on the deposits have to come from successful businesses.  The _only_ successful businesses that will be able to raise funds from the banks will be (tada) the ones that have business concepts that are so incredibly good that people will actually be willing to part with their savings in order to buy. Hint hint: It is _not_ an accident that electricity, auto-mobiles, airtravel, skyscrapers, telephones, intercontinental rail road, cinemas etc. where commercialized in the US first. In order to "lure" the public to spend their hard earned saving companies had to provide the most insane incentives. The public really had to feel that the goods and services provided was more worth right now than in the future. The exact opposite is true for inflationary currencies, people have a bias not to save, but to borrow. The money will not be worth more in the future, but less. Debt will be easier to repay so it "pays" to loan a lot and not to save. This means that people will try to _overconsume_ in the present instead of saving. When people are in a hurry to spend they will spend their money on just about anything - Junk, pebbles and trinkets. Companies can market just about the most crazy junk and it will sell. This creates huge distortions in the economy over time because the most successful companies will not be the ones that provide most value or innovation but companies that sells "cloudtalk": D&amp;G, Versache etc. Under the gold standard quality meant something, now companies build things to fail so they can sell even more because they know people cannot get rid of their money fast enough - it literally burns in their pockets. This would be impossible under a deflationary currency because people have the choice of purchasing now or later and the only reason to buy now is if the deal is sweet enough.
I fully expect the same to happen in the bitcoin economy. Right now gambling is a bit big, that is a novelty and a fad because of regulation. Soon the people who don't understand and value the extreme rarity of bitcoins will have lost their coins and only the serious contenders will own coins. To convince the holders to part with their steadily increasing wealth products and services of insane innovation have to be tailored. I can just guess from my own perspective what magnitude of products and services would be needed before i part with my coins: Customized medicine, spacetravel, personified clothing and apparel, the worlds most advanced financial services, anything that can put me "off the grid" (super efficient power generation, longrange wireless internet, 3D printers). The rest of the economy will see that only holders of bitcoins will attract and afford such quality and luxuries. Just like the gold standard "forced" the economy only to produce what helped us humans most with the least amount of resources, so will bitcoins do the same. We can see the very beginning of this pattern already today, a lot of early adopters refuse to spend their coins on trinkets, they demand exceptional products or value before buying anything. I have no faith in simple concepts like bitcoinstore.com or similar, it is in no way innovative enough to trigger mass sales with bitcoins. Its just mindless consumerism, the resources available to bitcoin'ers must be spend in the best rational self interest. Just like the world flocked to the US economy they will flock to bitcoin.

I think you give governement too much credit for being able to do anything. Even in completely totalitarian regimes like Soviet union, Cuba, North Korea etc black markets thrive and are probably the only thing preventing the entire economy from collapsing.

The good thing about bitcoin at least is that it doesn't discriminate or forcefully keep people away from market access. I think these point will make the wealth distribution the best of any currency. There are no unions, border guards, tolls, tarrifs, protectionism, subsidies to keep westerners rich and developing countries poor. Under bitcoin its much easier for everyone to reach their full potential - regardless of the government in your country. Its maybe easyist if you can do online work, for now, but even if you live in a dictatorship you can accumulate wealth to escape with. The ability to empower yourself financially outside of the "system" is incredibly powerful.

What you must understand is this is like when the US was on the gold standard. People will not spend today unless the product they want to buy  is worth more to them in the present than in the future. You cannot expect people to part with their coins for fluff and simple consumerism. Silkroad is thriving because it offers something completely different. Butterflylabs, Avalon get fully funded and sells out every time because their products are worth more in the present than in the future. Only the most innovative and productive companies will be able to survive and thrive in the bitcoin economy. To make a comparison to the US under gold standard: To be able to get people to part with their gold companies invented, commercialized and rolled out for the entire nation: Cars, electricity, television, telephony, intercontinental railroads, airplane travel. We are talking products that shifted the very fabric of society to the next level. I will not part with my bitcoins for anything less innovative. Barbiedolls, mp3 players, 60" televisions you can keep. I want spacetourism, ultra-efficient solar panels, flying cars, ultra-efficient salt to fresh water conversion, fuelcell technology, nano robots that keeps me healthy, everlasting lightbulbs, de-centralized wimax hubs for a "off the grid global internet" etc. I think you get the idea. To tease the holders of bitcoin to part with them its got to be something spectacular. Just wait until the price is high enough people will go into a mode of insane innovation to appease the bitcoin community.

I agree, its still inflating though. You could compare with gold. A long time ago the natives of South America didn't know its value so they used it for trinkets. Today gold is so valuable basically none is lost ever, its looked very well after. Bitcoin was like the gold to those natives in the beginning, people didn't care. Today its much more valuable and very little is lost. In a few years when the price is even higher people will go to great lengths to avoid losing bitcoin and even less will be lost.

When more people sell - the price goes down. When more people buy - the price goes up. This is pretty simple rules in a marketplace. Now more people are selling than buying. Why? There are thousands of participants in this market, everybody have their own ideas, the price is just the reflection on the aggregated sentiment of all the participants in the market.

The thing with bitcoin is that it is a completely unregulated free market. You have to act very defensively and think about security and fraud all of the time. There is no nanny state that will bail you out. Either you act responsibly, mature, grown up and well thought or you will lose your coins. You might say that this is a bad thing, that it is so "raw and brutal", but the truth is the exact opposite: The world _is_ raw and brutal, this will just force you to act in a way that you are not used to which in turn will make you stronger, more independent and self reliant. Don't let this single bad experience get to you, back on your feet, there is a world of opportunity here.

Right now it cant really be considered to be a currency. You say it yourself: The value needs to remain consistent for purchasing things. In the future when Bitcoin have grown a lot, have more mature markets, deeper markets, debt markets, futures markets - all of them with deep liquidity. Then it can be stable enough to price things in and become a currency.
The real ringer with bitcoin is what it enables. It truly is programmable money. It is the money of the information age. Right now companies dont get their income in bitcoin, they dont do their accounting in bitcoin and they dont organize ownership though bitcoin/blockchain. We will see companies, sooner than later, that do _everything_ in bitcoin. At that point it will become crystal clear that the synergies with the internet and bitcoin are going to be so insane that other companies cannot compete. If you company gains 2% margin because of efficient bookkeeping its going to rape the competition. We are in the tiniest start of the biggest thing here.

What could happen though is that somebody can pre-mine a fork called 'bitUSD'. This cryptocurrency would need a few more tweaks as well but basically it can be made so it will always trading at parity with USD. This way you can go in and out of bitUSD without actually needing a USD bank account etc. It would however be redeemable 1:1 in USD at exchanges when you saw it fit. Would be good to have something like that, would do online sales even easier.

"where the price no longer fluctuates".
Has he completely missed the point and dynamics of bitcoin. It is IMPOSSIBLE while bitcoin is so small that there can be any price stability. There is 12 million coins, every single person who wants to put money in bitcoin have to go through the keyhole that is 12 million bitcoin big. Nothing else will yield in this equation but price. 
The price needs to go up, the price must go up. As adoption spread it needs to go a lot up. The price peaks are just the market realising this and bringing some of the absolutely necessary price increase from the future to the present. So this guy with this article, just like so many others, miss the point. There will be no price stability for many years - and its not going to be a problem.

Its OK and good. Remember: the early adopters didn't invest in bitcoin as a get rich scheme. So as the price rose some of the cash out small parts of their stash. Why? To invest in bitcoin infrastructure and services. Where do you think the money to finance asic chips, advanced software development came from? So much of the bitcoin infrastructure is paid for by speculators. I very rarely see these "thank you bitcoin" pics with a Porche on it. Its much more common with introduction of new products and services that have not been free to develop. Investors and speculators in bitcoin to a large degree finance bitcoins infrastructure and development.

The big bank are created by big government. At this time it is not possible to make the banks smaller by breaking them up.

I dont think bitcoins are lacking anything, at least not right now. The topic was worst case scenarios. I think one of the scenarios is a direct competitor with a backing in for example gold that is very credible and trustworthy. I think such a competitor will crystallize sometime in the coming decade. If we as a community don't rise to this challenge it can be very damaging to bitcoins. We have good time to prepare. We can even be so lucky that there is a lot of backing by people doing actual labour for bitcoins which would back it in productivity, that could be a good counterbalance.

Mild monetary deflation is ok/neutral. But a monetary deflationary shock is extremely damaging for the economy. For bitcoin it would not matter in the current if half of the coins disapear in lost wallets. But just wait until there is a lot of debt nominated in bitcoin, and there will be. Or there is a lot of bitcoin derivatives resting on the shoulders on real coins. If a lot of coins is destroyed then its going to be extremely painful for the bitcoin economy. And if you think there will be no fractional reserve bitcoining, you are in for a shock.

Yes, slavery had to be abolished and the system had to grow into its own body. Just like we have seen strange things, heists, fraud and bubble etc just inside our small bitcoin economy. For every "event" that have happened in bitcoin the responce from the community have been to adapt, learn and change. If somebody come along now and say: "ill give you 5% weekly interest, give me all of your money" i don't think it will happen again. Just as all the exchange are protected from somebody purging the entire sales book at market price. The US economy had to learn all sorts of lessons over this period. The net effect was always more and more robustness and steady growth. A dynamic economy work like that, there will always be growth pains in one or several areas, uneven growth that with an avalanche catches up.

You forget the most important that i think trumps all:
Bitcoin allows _anyone_ (no matter poor or rich) from any country around the globe (no matter free or dictatorship) to create an account by their own hands and store and transfer any amount of wealth essentially for free without the possibility of being stopped, hindered - instantly. If you don't think that is a thing that have value for humanity you are living on the wrong planet. 90% of the earth's population do not have access to a functioning banking system. They have access to internet though and they can work of only the financial structure around them was better. Bitcoin offers banking to those who have none. The speculative price will only function as to trigger / verify / fund bitcoin's infrastructure and validity as a true global currency.
Its not a currency yet, rather an extremely good store of value / payment system. But once pricing happens in bitcoin it will step up as the most beautiful financial innovation since paper money.

Hoarding is extremely positive and important for bitcoin. Its a little bit difficult to get your head around it when you hear it, but: When you hoard you are in reality giving an _interest free_ loan to the people who use bitcoin for productive purposes.
When you hoard you are in effect removing bitcoins from circulation. This increases the purchasing power of all the bitcoins which are in circulation. This means that the people who want to use bitcoin for productive purposes get more for their coins than if you had spent your coins. The more people that hoard the more the value increases. In return for the interest free loan the entrepreneurs will build infrastructure, products and services which over time will make the hoarded coins more liquid and more valuable.
As a sidenote: Do not spend your coins on fluff and mindless consumerism. Bitcoins are so incredibly rare and valuable that you should _only_ spend them on things that are subjectively more valuable to you in the present than the future. This will force merchants that want to get hold of your coins to innovate / provide such good value for money that you cannot stop yourself from purchasing in the present. Products and services that are so attractive are almost bound to be linked by the hip to bitcoin. Silkroad is an example. By rewarding products and services of this type the bitcoin economy will breed the most innovative companies in this business cycle = giant win for crypto currencies.

These thefts have got to stop. The protocol need to be changed. Bitcoin is like driving a car with a spear lodged between the steering wheel and your chest. If you make even the slightest mistake and bump into something you die. We need accounts that are not instant transfers where its possible to stop a transaction within a time window. Wallets are instant. Accounts have a 1 day delay. Vaults have a 7 day delay. You could then keep 90% of your stash in accounts where you can reverse the transaction if you didn't initiate it. I am so fucking nervous i pee myself every time i use my wallet It cant be a payment system for the regular Joe when its like this, this is stupid.

Some tips when you have purchased: Don't store the coins at the exchange. You need to take direct ownership youself. For a super easy and care free setup that requires not so much technical and security knowledge:
Buy a smartphone with the sole purpose of being your main wallet. This phone should ideally be a completely clean and simple phone, like the samsung galaxy nexus or the LG Nexus 4 or 5. All of these phones comes stripped to the bone of any pre installed third party software / apps. Enable passwords and phone encryption. Create a wallet, back up encrypted keys to your email and fill it up. Just have it turned off unless you are going to do a transaction. This is your "vault".
They you can use a different wallet on your regular phone / pad / laptop to keep smaller amounts of bitcoin for spending on a day to day bases.

It cant be a feasible alternative currency at the low values we see now, the price must up to at least 5-10 times as much as now, minimum. If you decided today to buy something as simple as a sports scar and pay with bitcoins you would have to place a buy order for say 100k USD to get hold of those coins. This would blow through most if not all of the order book at MTGox. And in the process of doing this you would actually trade with a fair share of all bitcoins in existence. Price needs to come up a long way and volume too. Also; there will never be stability if you measure the price against other unstable currencies. The only reason those government backed monstrosities seems to be stable is that they all debase them at an equal pace. Bitcoins are the polar opposite. And the constantly increasing price is supergood for bitcoins. Contrary to popular belief hoarding is very positive. The price goes up because of hoarding. The effect of hoarding is witholding money from the money supply which drives up the purchasing power of the coins that actually are circulating. If you hoard you are in effect giving an interest free loan to the ones that spend because it increases their purchasing power. And if you take notice a lot of people are funding projects related to bitcoins _with_ bitcoins = hoarding is an investment in the continued development of bitcoins.

No. Its just conforming to the norm. Stocks split when they get too "expensive". Stocks cant be divided like bitcoin so this makes sense to do this since you always have to buy a whole unit at a time. You can consider this a stock "changing gear". 
 Because of this people have gotten used to prices of financial instruments always being within a certain range, no matter what the market cap of the company. Since bitcoin can't split we just have to do the thing we can: change the nomination. All the exchanges, wallets and price tickers should do this. Sure it can be BTC option as well, but let mBTC be the default. I think this is needed to "change gear" on bitcoin just as in stocks. Its easy to see how many people are confused and refuse to buy because the they think they have to buy an entire coin.

Pretty high. It has to be high to have utility. Its too cheap for large transactions now. Basically it has to grow to such a point where asks/puts in the hundreds of millions of dollars would not move the price notably in either direction. At this point it would be safe for vendors to actually price thing in bitcoin without doing calculations back to FIAT currencies. It cant really be called a currency before pricing happens in bitcoin. Years away and the price needs to be magnitudes higher + a functioning futures and derivatives market.

This assumes that only governments are the danger. I would say that more is better because there can be a real showdown of crypto currencies in the future. Right now the bitcoiners are benign because they are the biggest and most valuable. What if litecoin grows to become a threat. It is not completely unthinkable that one or more pools would spend time and effort destroying the blockchain of competing currencies. We must never let any other competing currency buildt on the same technology as bitcoin come even close to such a position. If bitcoin should have competition it should be from new tech that is not buildt the same way as bitcoin with minor tweaks. There can only be one blockchain.

I think it will be the complete opposite. Up until now the banks have done the governments bidding and helped them fund the governments deficit spending. They will have to stop this as the government debt will not be considered safe enough without the carte blanche bailout insurance policy. The banks will in effect switch sides from the government side of things to the people side of things. That will be a massive change as it would become crystal clear all of a sudden what has been going on for everybody. The banks will be sure to communicate this correctly. As i said this would leave governments with very few choices how to continue doing their business, deficit spending would be off the table without direct monetization. Direct monetization from a western central bank basically spells the end of the entire western economic paradigm.  
It is this simple fact that leads me to believe the bail-ins will never happen. The central banks know all to well the banks role in this little charade they got going. The central banks will gently explain to the politicians that forcing this line of action would revoke their ability to spend spend spend. And that will be the end of that. The game must go on.

"The great depression didn't occur because the number of banknotes or gold in the world somehow decreased."
But the total money supply did decrease - a lot. The roaring twenties was a massive build-up of debt and money equivalents. The banks lent out vast amount of money without differentiating between demand deposits and interest bearing timed accounts. At one point the debt to real money ratio was so out of balance even a small shock would trigger uncontrolled deleveraging, which happened. As an example: There were 100 dollars in debt and only 5 dollars to service that debt. As you point out, velocity grind to a standstill. Everybody was hoarding money to be able to repay debt. Banks had to wait for debt to be repaid before they could honour payments to their clients with accounts. In a desperate attempt to get more money into circulation all gold was confiscated and new money was issued backed by the new gold, but it was just not enough. Maybe they were able to increase the money supply from 5 to 7 but the debt burden was still incredibly large. And that debt is money equivalents. This can just as easily happen under bitcoin, if bitcoin banks take deposits and promise interest, those coins you deposit will be on your balance sheet as equity. At the same time the exact same coins will be listed as equity in the company the bank lends your bitcoin to. You can even sell your interest baring bond to a third-party for bitcoin. There will be a big derivative market in bitcoin and money equivalents will be created. Bitcoin can suffer a monetary deflationary crises just as the US did under the gold standard. Lets just hope the lesson of differentiating between timed and demand deposits have been learned to avoid this.
Short recap: During the Great Depression the prices fell because the money supply contracted incredibly fast. 
Here is a nice graph:
The money supply contracted incredibly fast from 1929 to 1933. In 1933 They confiscated gold and added vastly to the money supply. They also devalued, but im not sure when.
Todays banking system is modelled revolving around this kind of monetary deflation never happening again. So when stocks collapsed in 2007 and the debt bubble burst: They did exactly what they could not do during the depression - added liquidity like crazy. 
Price deflation _if_ its caused by the economy growing faster than the money supply _is_ positive. I don't care what "serious mainstream economists" mean about this, they are wrong, proof?
Just look at the US economy 150 years prior to 1913. Then it was a pure gold standard with privately issued gold money. Never in the history of the world have an economy grown so fast and so many innovations put to market before. More happened to human kind those 150 years than in the 1500 before. It is not only because of sound money, but also with private property and enforcing good private property laws and rule of law. But sound money was a large part of this equation. It is solely because of the US long period of extremely successful gold money that they were given the opportunity to become the world reserve currency under Bretton Woods I and II. The prudence, ability to stick to principles and obey the rule of law was something the countries submitting under the US dollar recognized as something rare and sacred. That the US just broke every rule possible just after starting Bretton Woods is the reason there is no gold standard any longer. Bitcoin does not need to change anything, it _is_ an inflationary currency but the rate of inflation is so slow and the economy is expanding so fast that users will experience price deflation. This price deflation will encourage savings. Savings is the key to any successful economy. To be able to persuade bitcoiners to part with they savings companies have to offer something in the present that outweighs the increased purchasing power in the future. That means innovation at a grand scale. Like space travel. It is no accident that Telephones, record players, radio, televison, cars, trains, airplanes, electricity, skyscrapers etc etc was invented and/or commercialized in a country with a price deflating currency like Gold. People didn't buy trinkets with their gold. And people will not buy trinkets with their bitcoins either. Bitcoin can become a global reserve currency just as it is.

Its a matter of perspective. For western democracies who has used monetary policy and manipulation to keep developing countries poor bitcoin will be very negative. Bitcoins unyielding properties will ensure that wealth flows from unproductive to productive individuals. Seldom in history have more undeserving individuals had access to an undeserved lifestyle than in the present. The welfare states of the west are deeply unproductive and yet enjoy lifestyles that should be reserved for thriving economies. This will end and bitcoin will help accelerate the process (if given the chance). 
Under bitcoin users are forced to trade value for value. Some people will see this as deeply negative, as it will hinder them from looting others labour. 
For peaceful, productive and honest individuals bitcoin have no negative effects.

But Northern Rock had a liquidity crises bases on debt. People had made deposits. They loaned out the money. People repay loans with interest. But people wanted to withdraw money faster than people repay. That is the definition of a liquidity crisis. Mtgox is not the same at all, for them to have a liquidity crisis they must have stolen their clients money. In an exchange there is always a 1:1 relationship in the client accounts on how much is deposited and how much that can be withdrawn.

Why not just use bitcoins like everybody else or at least create something original. I understand the frustration of not being one of the early adopters and all, but staring your own fork just to be able to mine the first coins will not make you rich. Cryptocurrency is such a new concept and have so few users globally its frustrating that the able few who can program these things cannot just work on the same project.

Yes, there are a lot of bitcoin units. But from the start they were traded and mined in what we refer to as a bitcoin. There are few of these compared to how many people there are on the planet. This is not a challenge for bitcoin. But if bitcoin ever becomes _really_ big, universal, it means that even 0.001 coin have got to be worth hundreds of dollars. Its the only way it can be useful for billions of people. This means volatility on a large scale to get there.

As a young person with life ahead of you it is smart to buy a small sum of bitcoin. Bitcoin is the most asymmetric bet you will see or hear about _in your entire life_. An asymmetric bet means that the potential reward far outweighs the potential loss. You can buy bitcoin for 1000 USD now and they will be worth 10 000x that in a few years. Do not get fooled that the price is 200 USD per coin now and that seems "expensive". The hard limit of 21 million coins ensures that any influx of businesses / usage / spread / speculation can only manifest itself in one single way: price increase. Combine this with the paradigm shifting features of bitcoin + currency crisis all over the world and you have a pork barrel of goodness.
To me its a no brainer. I have saved in bitcoin for a long time and not looked back or been affected by any price fluctuations.

Its a good thing. By taking 1000 coins into your savings "account" you withdraw 1000 coins from circulation, at least temporarily. 1000 coins less in circulation increases the purchasing power of the coins actually in circulation. The net effect of your purchase is that you give an interest free loan to the people actually using bitcoin for productive stuff - and that is a good thing! I also think you buy at a good price, sure it can go down a bit further, but the future looks good for bitcoin no matter how you turn it.

For bitcoin it would be very easy to achieve this backing. The different exchanges would use a tiny portion of their commission to buy physical bullion. Periodically they would hand over the bullion to multiple custodians in multiple countries which enforce strict privacy and respect private ownership. Typically the custodians would be law firms in Singapore / Hong Kong / Switzerland. The custodians have no vested interest in either bitcoin or gold, they just get paid a fee to tend to bitcoiners coming into their office exchanging bitcoins for the gold they have been provided to by the exchanges. Over time the backing would increase from zero to a lot. You know the reason why CHF have been a "reserve" currency for decades? Historically they have had a 20% gold backing. Even these 20% turned out to be decisive when people chose which currency they should run to when the shit hit the fan. Though a small country CHF remains one of the strongest currencies in the world because of this. Just a 10% backing in bitcoin would make it immensely more powerful for trade.

I don't think many people in the bitcoin community have understood what the real big elephant in the room is. Right now most people involved in the bitcoin community are westerners and for us its cool to be able to gamble a little bit, buy some drugs and brag about anonymous transactions. But there are about 7 billion people on this planet, of these my guesstimate is that about less than a billion of these actually have access to a debit or credit card that can be used to do online purchases or transactions. For everybody else this is an extreme luxury that is very hard to obtain. For example in the Philippines where i'm currently at with a 100.000.000 population very few people have a proper visa/mastercards that can be used for online activities, the minimum maintaining balance to get a real proper visacard which can be used online is currently $60.000 USD, and for a mastercard around $10.000 USD. This is the reality around 6 billion people live with. They are completely cut off from what we consider every day normal banking. They are doomed to use Western Union and similar services for even the smallest transfers because all transactions they do are cash based and they have to pay enormous fees. Bitcoins knows no borders, its the poorest people who have the most to gain by adopting bitcoins. As soon as more and more simpler services arrive more and more people in the 3rd world will adopt bitcoins. Just enabling them to avoid having anything to do with local currencies with 10-30% annual inflation rate and constant debasing will give them more than enough of an incentive.
It will give them access to do person to person transfers and simple online purchases that they have never had access to before. Smartphones are getting so incredibly cheap that even what we consider the poorest people on earth will soon have access to them, i can go buy a perfectly good brand new android phone here from Samsung and it cost just around 70-80 USD, in a few years it will be half this price, that is within reach of even people living on 10$ a day. When this adoption starts it will enable people in poorer countries to do work online and get paid in bitcoins, internet is already cheap and fully available even in rural areas all over the world. No unions, trade walls, import duties or subsidies can prevent this from happening. The great wealth transfer from the walled up western countries will escalate even faster. Bitcoins are truly the great equalizer. Right now the tools and applications are revolving around product and services we westerners find interesting, this will just provide bitcoins with the economic bases and volume that triggers the next wave of adoption. Soon you will find that you have a bookkeeper in Indonesia, your personal photoshop guy that retouches and organize all your family photos from Myanmar and a doctor from Philippines that will help you 24/7 answering your concerns in realtime - all of them paid in bitcoins. Possibly you will not even know where they are from, and you wont care as long as the service is top notch and the prices are low.

What are you talking about? Nobody could act like a central bank even though both them and the entire community wanted them to. Its not possible to add or remove liquidity arbitrarily for anyone with bitcoin so this cannot be.
What can be expected however is that exchanges, and Mt. Gox in particular, need to do is to actually realize they are not the NYSE. If they don't have a trading engine that can handle 100.000 x 000.1 spam trades an hour then need to limit those. This it not playing central bank, its just common fucking sense.

Normally there is no dialogue or discussion as the majority simply dictates what is going to happen to the minority. Democracy is nothing but crude mob rule. Bitcoin actually levels the playing field. The majority actually needs to go into constructive discussions with the minority. Basically the majority needs to peacefully and with civility convince the minority to join their plans. Voluntarism is bitcoins defining trait. Socialists / communists / leftists will never ever get funding from me. They can fund their own nightmare society. For the first time in history its possible not to sign the "social contract". That is a step in the right direction, lets face it; how good an idea can the social contract really be if you have to be forced at gunpoint to accept it?

The problem is that the stock market / forex charts are fractal in nature. If you remove the time-scale of the chart there is no way of knowing if you are looking at a chart where each sample point is 1 second or a 100 years apart. When somebody then takes a chart depicting a 5 wave rise and a standard ABC correction and calls it something "profound" you will be able to stick that chart on any scale on any day on any traded instrument. This is literally the most common pattern - which is exactly why at every single boom and bust of bitcoin someone post it. You are completely free to try to trade after this pattern, you will lose your shirt in a heartbeat. You would have done so just since yesterday when the price reversed completely just at point where your arrow keeps pointing downwards.

The foundation of bitcoins economic principle is voluntary participation, no central entity in control, a strict monetary policy. This is pretty much the polar opposite compared to the belief system Krugman subscribes to. I don't think I'm stretching it far when I claim Krugman is a Marxist. Bitcoin is the nightmare scenario for anyone who thinks that big government is a great idea and that the people are like small children that can't take care of themselves needing god like politicians to take care of them. Bitcoin have proven, already at this point, that the claim by government that they _have_ to be in charge of the issuance of currency because its too important for letting the civil part of the economy issue this themselves is a blatant lie. All history have shown that nobody have turned out to be worse custodians of currency than governments. Bitcoin is the literal response to this, a direct attack on the insanity of statism. Bitcoin: by the people, for the people!

The death penalty is certainly practised still, but _extremely_ rarely. I do not condone of death penalty, but its not an arbitrary jury thing that kills a lot of innocents like in the US. Sinapore have one very simple rule: Zero drugs. Anybody caught with drugs will be executed, period. So once a decade some fool gets caught and they kill him. Personally I lean towards complete drug liberalization, but apparently its not possible to find a country with absolutely everything perfect, Singapore is still the closest if you can avoid being a drug addict.
Caning as punishment for crimes: I love it. This should be practised more, its fast, cheap, the sentence is carried out close in time to the crime (which is apparently important for us humans if we want to learn from our mistakes) and it leaves the perpetrator without mental scars (which is as it turns out much worse than a physical scar on your back). And you don't get a caning for something crazy and irrelevant. Like many things in Singapore it must be related to property (serious theft, destruction, vandalism etc). If this was practised in the West you just know there would be caning for all the wrong things: Getting social security unduly, parking tickets, tax evasion, building a house not according to the zoning regulation. That is why caning could never work in the west.
There are monetary fines for most everything else, including throwing trash at the ground, spitting chewing gum, smoking at public places etc. I _love_ this. The entire city is completely clean and nobody ever throws anything anywhere. In reality nobody is ever fined for these things, people just behave. And _if_ somebody gets fined: Don't think about it as a fine, if you litter somebody actually have to pick up after you, you are just paying their salary and equipment, its expensive to have people work in Singapore. It is not a human right to freely have hundreds of people pick up your trash where ever you go. In the west this is included in your taxes, we all see how well that works. All the cities in Europe look like garbage dumps compared to Singapore.
The thing about Singapore, as far as i know, is that there are few rules that are simple and logical to understand and to follow. Its not like the West where you will basically break the law 10 times a day unknowingly because there are 800.000 different laws and 60.000 new laws a year that you have to know about. This makes it easy to live, work, create business and live a good life in Singapore. As an example i have not witnesses _anywhere_ else on the planet it takes one single day to set up a corporation in Singapore - even if you are a foreigner without residency permit you can do this. That is unique. Of all the countries on the planet, only citizens of Iraq and other war zone countries even need  a visa to enter. Compare this to the Eurozone or the US and its so free in comparison, its fantastic.

The big difference is that with bitcoin there are no rules, regulation, artificial barriers, duties or unions to keep the poor poor. Work for bitcoin and you will get what the free market allows you to get. Nobody will stop you from doing some plumbing because you are not a member in the plumbers union. Start any business you want online and keep your books and profits in bitcoin and you will have empowered yourself in a manner not seen for quite some time on this planet. Get out there, do something for others they are willing to pay for. Everybody have a talent they can master that other's will pay for. Bitcoin will reward those who help themselves handsomely because bitcoin favours the producers over the consumers. There will be just as little wage inequality under bitcoin as under the gold standard period in the US.

User bases explode over night into the hundreds of millions when new services are introduced. Its like one day there is nothing, the next day its youtube which suddenly everybody uses and think to themselves: I cannot envision a world without this service, how could i have lived without this. If bitcoin reach any kind of critical mass adoption will saturate the population fast.
The Visa/Mastercard people are like Blockbuster. They are cought in a web of non-innovation. They have the brand, the opportunity to change but fail to do so only to be replaced by a completely unknown startup overnight like Netflix. At his point their only rational behavior would be to try to launch their own crypto currency, slashing transaction costs. It does't matter if they will earn less, it's either less or bust. The genie is out of the bottle...

People are going to spend, but not on fluff and consumerism. The only incentive to buy is if the product will improve your life more in the present than in the future. This puts a big pressure on merchants. On the other hand, if you are going to spend and buy things anyway, who not keep your savings in bitcoin, its bound to be better than fiat...

How can you even get wired money into Mt. Gox in any way or form costing you less than $26 in fees? Should be a $100 minimum per trade. If you are buying or selling less than this go somewhere else. Someone would start micro exchanges for lower values.

Maybe the most friendly / non aggressive approach is not to try to sell bitcoin. Ask them if you can have the opportunity to research and create a thorough study / report to them exploring the potential positive and negative sides to accepting bitcoin. It is very simple for management to say yes to something like that. This means that you will have time to prepare a thorough presentation that they have to listen to, read and look into.
If you include a short transaction example and let them transact themselves too with their smartphones its difficult not to be impressed by the ease and speed of bitcoin.

Not so smart to send without fees in today's market. It can hang around for ages, should go through eventually but it can take a looong time. The mining pools are only picking out transactions with the highest transaction fees for confirmation. Turns out that electricity costs money and they want to optimize their profits. Apparently there is a way to fix this if he gets really desperate where its possible to inject the same transaction with a fee, this new transaction happens first and invalidates the old one. I have no idea how this is done, you cannot do this with the standard client.

Its not crashes, its price discovery. What _is_ the correct price for a bitcoin? Nobody knows. That is why the market seeks. If the participants believes the the price is too high, they will sell pushing the price down. If they believe the price is too low they will buy bringing the price up. The "problem" with bitcoin is that a LOT of the value of bitcoin is not here, but in the future. As the participants judge how positive or negative the future will be they factor this into today's price. Needless to say that is where the volatility comes from. It is extremely difficult to price a thing like bitcoin correctly - hence the big swings.

For me the essence of bitcoin is simple and harch: In order to consume you must first produce. There is no trickery with bitcoin.

Pretty vast a difference from today's system.

Yes, but which direction the price reaches for is not the same. Is it the bidder that reach for the seller or the seller that reach for the bidder, that is what drives the price up or down.
In regards to that its the number of coins that is important and not the number of people. Yes, the number of coins move the actual market, but it is always people who decide if that move was right or wrong. If You try to dump 20.000 coins in hop to buy them back cheaper later you will be very disappointed if the sentiment in the market is that your low price was wrong and the price should be higher.
I like to think of this as a stampede. If you are in a herd that moves in one direction you can try to run as fast and hard in another direction as you wish. If the other participants don't believe in your direction they will continue in theirs and you will be running alone far away (and lose money).

On an extremely long time frame, yes. But the Dollar will be huge for as long as we live. There is no currency on the planet with more debt (houseloans, infrastructure loans, national debt) nominated in it than the USD. This means there will be a huge demand from all over the world for USD every day/week/month to repay these loans. Houseloans run into decades, infrastructure loans even longer, i think the longest running government debt can run into a century although its not normal.
So Bitcoin can grow big, but its difficult on a short / medium term to displace something as established as the USD.

Problem is that when bitcoin gets to be worth a lot why would you even need to sell? I just want to have bitcoin. I cry a little inside every time I buy something with them. Why on earth would I want to swap them for a national currency? I understand this is the case in a ponzi, pyramid, tulip scheme or whatever. But if bitcoin really takes of there is no need to ever exit bitcoin. People will accept them for salaries. I can already purchase a hell of a lot of things with bitcoin directly. I'm not alone thinking like this. Bitcoin isn't a get rich scheme so it will behave different.

I have to say im a bit sceptical about this article. It does not contain any evidence, it is pure speculation. The essence of the claim have to be that Mt.Gox have failed their fiduciary duty and mixed client accounts with their own expense accounts. This is outright theft and im sure it involves pretty nice prison sentences in Japan. Even though Mt. Gox have had some mishaps early on I refuse to believe this it true just because of some far-fetched speculation if mt gox have sold some coins to get hold of USD based on the price fluctuations of Bitcoin.
As i am a little bit involved in a financial institution i know how extremely tedious it is to get transaction systems automated and integrated into existing banking systems. We are running a business larger than Mt.Gox and are still processing transactions manually. I find it much more plausible that they have been overwhelmed from three sides: Users who want to deposit and withdraw, Banks with 200 year old terminology and 50 year old computer systems and completely Nazi money laundering rules. I think thing goes slow because they are extremely paranoid. They process withdrawals by hand, if they transfer wrongly it will come out of their pocket - this means double and triple checking by multiple people for each withdrawal. If they allow a withdrawal to go though that should no because of laundering rules they can be shut down immediately.
Both me and my wife have withdrawn regularly over a long period of time, never had a single hickup yet. I initiated another one today just to check.
This is exactly the kind of rumour that should not be allowed to spread without something more substantial backing it up.

Im not sure. Just having one more crypto currency that you can move into and out of in a liquid market can really add the absolute anonymity bitcoin doesn't have now. Selling your BTC for LTC on a big exchange and then buying back a few hours later will in effect completely launder your bitcoins.

Would just like to point out that bitcoin is NOT a "deflationary currency". Are there more bitcoin in existence now than 10 minutes ago? YES. Bitcoin has been inflating since 2009 and will be inflating for the next 100 years. You have to separate between monetary deflation and price deflation. Monetary deflation under a FIAT currency is bad. Price deflation is what is happening / will happen to bitcoin. Price deflation happens when the economy grows faster than currency units - This is extremely positive. It promotes savings and forces innovation. Bitcoin is an inflationary currency, just inflating so slow that the economy outpace the new issuance.

Since you are new to this you need to be extra careful, it is very easy losing your coins if you don't pay close attention to what you are doing.
You can have as many clients and wallets running as you see fit, you just transfer money between your accounts.
A suggestion would be _not_ to use the official client/wallet. Keeping that wallet.dat file safe from virus/trojans/harddrive crashes etc have proved to be very difficult for novices.
Use two wallets, one for storage and one for daily use. Most coins in the storage account which you access as rarely as possible from safe computers.
1. Buy a Yubikey
2. Create online wallet at blockchain.info
3. Create really good password + secondary password. These should both be passwords you don't use anywhere else.
4. Pair your account with your Yubikey.
Thoroughly test that you can log in and out with all passwords.
5. Buy a few coins / mine coins
6. Test again and again that everything works. Transfer a little bit back and forth to get the hang of it. Never ever write addresses by hand. Always copy / paste or QR codes. Always check the first four and last four characters in an address before sending coins that everything is correct.
7. Buy more coins first when you feel comfortable you know what you are doing. A lot of people manages to lose their coins because of sloppyness and incompetence.
Spending wallet:
Use electrum wallet on your phone. Its fairly easy to get running on an Android phone, it is just a pyhton script so if you havent done it before its a small threshold to learn. There is a good guide at the electrum wallet site. Transfer only "small change" to this wallet. As long as you have the seed / mnemonic you dont have to be afraid to lose your phone, you can always restore your money.
The seed / mnemonic for the electrum wallet + all the backups needed for blockchain.info you should store in an encrypted truecrypt volume which you upload to your skydrive/gdrive/dropbox account (or all of them).
You really want to spend time making sure your coins are safe as can be...
The mining process have _nothing_ to do with your wallet(s). You don't need to have any kind of wallet software installed on the machines you mine with. And wallets dont technically store your balance, the wallet only contains the secret keys which gives you "admin rights" / control over certain of the accounts in the blockchain. Your balance is only "stored" in the blockchain.

Taxes would shift from areas of no control to areas of control. So: away from personal income tax, capital gains tax etc over to consumption taxes (vat) and property taxes. Its the logical conclusion. What would happen after this shift is that people get angry I think. When taxes are smudged out across hundreds of hidden fees, duties, subsidies etc its really difficult to get an overview how you get sucked dry, but wait until the entire cost of the government is squeezed into 2-3 easy to the understand taxes... People will go postal.

The guy that held the lecture is named Anthony Hope. He works for a company specializing in bank compliance for bitcoin companies: Matrix Vision.
From his resume:
"Anthony leads MatrixVision’s compliance side, delivering industry best practice and helping our clients navigate the regulatory landscape. In a previous life, he worked for the United Kingdom Government across a range of compliance roles, including handling the development of terrorist asset freezing legislation for HM Treasury. He also has experience in tackling fiscal crime with HM Revenue and Customs. Anthony has been in the Bitcoin business for about a year."
He has been working with these exact issues for the British government for years. The explanation he had for the 'high risk' bracket was extremely fitting for what all the Coinbase customers can be "targets" of.

Tip: A bet on bitcoin is a binary bet, they can either go to thousands of dollars each or they will go to zero. There is _no_ other option. Success or failure. If you already almost doubled your initial investment you should sell half your holding and be happy with that, you have in essence gotten them for free and you will be debt free in addition. Just the coins you have left will provide you with a good bonus for your retirement if bitcoins turns out to be great.

0.01, long time before MtGox. I have had 110% full faith in bitcoin since January/February 2010. I read the paper and convinced all my friends to start mining. Those who didn't believe my ramblings are so incredibly sad today. Boom or bust, i never stopped believing, no way i will sell out at anything less than several thousand USD per coin, this is either multi multi millionaire or nothing. My friends wanted to sell out on $1, $2, $5, $10, $15. I have shouted their ears off getting them to understand the pointlessness at selling out so low, they are slowly starting to understand. People who sell at these prices are insane or dumb, i cant understand what they are thinking. Its like selling gold for a dime an ounce and being incredibly happy because you found it in the ground so easily. Bitcoins are so incredibly rare its difficult to fathom, they are so difficult to hold on to. Only the most responsible, disciplined and principled will be able to hold on to these artefacts up to the point where its really worth selling them. I think the worlds first freestate will be financed by bitcoin and early bitcoiners, most of the early adopters are strongly politically motivated and will not sell out for a Porche or a new house.

Some Von Mises acolytes have a _very_ strict definition that  basically renders _anything_ except for gold "not money".
That said, maybe its not - yet. Its definitely not currency. Nothing it nominated in Bitcoin yet so its hard to argue its a currency. All pricing is always done in USD and converted to Bitcoin. Once Bitcoin is so big and stable that pricing happens directly in bitcoin its certainly a currency, then we can have the money debate.

Bitcoin _IS_ not a currency so why the anger. In all seriousness, it is not possible to price anything in bitcoin as long as its unstable. And it will be unstable for a long time. Just like gold that was first used as a store of value or commodity before it became currency/money bitcoin has to do the same thing. Its not possible to kickstart a currency from nothing with the premises bitcoin is operating under. So you need to give it a lot of time to grow big, confidence needs to grow big. Pricing needs to be done exclusively in bitcoin, then it can become currency.

If any nation state had anything to do with bitcoins inception i think its Israel. Their US support will slowly erode and they know it. They need continued large scale funding to stay safe. They do have the best cryptographers, programmers and financial people on the face of the earth to do this. Their currency is not strong enough to do this and they have no influence over the major other currencies. Their best bet is to end up owning a shit load of the worlds next reserve currency and make sure bitcoin becomes _it_. Its not a conspiracy its just something that I think about that has more than a 0.1% probability.
