Some people will comply and some people won't. I think it would be like when the US government asked for the people's gold when they took the dollar off the gold standard.

Will do. I'll get all signed up shortly.

All personal transactions. As it stands now, if I was to send you $10,000 it would be reported to the CRA and they would track the transaction. They have one year to find a way to that with cryptocurrency. Canada still remains to be cryptocurrency friendly but they will take caution to large transactions. Just they way they do with CAD or USD 
@_date: 2014-03-02 06:27:04
I like this idea
@_date: 2014-05-27 01:46:43
I use mycelium to sell the coins.

This post isn't very Shibe like at all. If the NASCAR post had anything to do with bitcoin ie. How can btc benefit from dogecoins media exposure? Than maybe it would not have been deleted. But the post had nothing to do with btc at all.

Some if us use cryptoproperty to avoid banks, not our government
@_date: 2014-07-24 13:35:15
It did bring a lot if new faces to cryptocurrency. Some of those new faces are now buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:03:21
Nope, Bitcoin, Litecoin and Doge

Scam, there is so many escrow services that would do this. Why would they be asking you?

This is kinda how a tipbot works. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 20:55:36
They have more fees and higher rates than any other bank.

This is what moolah.io does plus they are attached to the exchange prelude.io for coin to cash or cash to coin conversion. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 16:45:05
In Canada you only report it when you convert it back to fia. You only need to claim the capital gain. So you invested $337 and say you get cash out at $537, you would report $200 as capital gain. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:12:14
Will they multiply or just get ugly?

No, go use that card at a book store ore take a cute girl out for lunch. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 17:44:03
Now I feel like I should get back to work
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:57:36
Some people think they won't ever get the coins out and you have better chance getting fia out

If the merchant prices the same based on current price of btc, you save on transaction fees. Most merchants give a discount for using btc because the save on transaction fees too

That is a huge amount of hashing power. Asics farm? 
@_date: 2014-07-26 00:10:31
If your a dogecoin miner, litecoin would make the most sense. They are both script coins so you already have the hardware.  Bitcoin is clearly an easy investment decision as its very easy to spend or convert to other crypto currency.

How do you feel about the viral vide of those two guys trying to use a robocoin ATM? They definitely didn't like the sell factor of the process.
@_date: 2014-07-20 11:56:28

I have tried a few cloud mining services. They do mine for you with your own worker that you make. You see the hashing power and payout so yes they are actually mining.  
@_date: 2014-07-18 23:18:56
I might use that

The company behind prelude that also has a store front merchant service, ATM's and more. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 18:38:42
It is still profitable, just not as profitable. It takes longer to see ROI but any return if investment in under a year still makes me happy. 
@_date: 2014-08-29 22:58:29
Not when I'm joining the pool and making the worker. I can see the hashing power when I log into the pool. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 17:59:03

You could always buy some of the alt coins that are easy to get your hands on, trading coin to coin doesn't need any verification. So putting the altcoin like dogecoin on an exchange for btc. That's how I do it. I buy dogecoin with PayPal and exchange them on prelude.io for btc. I usually have my btc in minutes.
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:54:05
I'm shocked that they behave this way. It's very unprofessional. Charge back your credit card and keep this conversation log as proof as to why. 
@_date: 2014-04-24 18:48:52

I believe everything you said but you have to realize the dogecoin has been a great gateway cryptocurrency. The Shibes are friendly and willing to answer the same question about cryptocurrency 1000 times a day with a smile and tip to follow. After the high is gone, the smart ones come to bitcoin. I think of dogecoin like a bitcoin filter.
@_date: 2014-07-11 19:56:28
You should check out VoS, they have this thing called divcoin that represents shares of a mining farm. It pays out everyday and the divcoin can be sold at anytime
@_date: 2014-04-28 23:24:12

@_date: 2014-04-07 00:33:49

Bitcoin.org is the best idea. From there they can access any specific data they are looking for.

Of course. Fir me most of my coins are safe and secure in my QT wallet and that wallet is backed up. I also have online wallet that I fund for trading and one here on reddit for tipping. And I keep a few on my phone for paying for cab or something. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:26:27
The price of the coin isn't what is important. Let's see if they make use of it when distributed. Or are they going to sell the coins for cash?
@_date: 2014-04-27 03:13:47
You should check out moolah.io they have an easy to use store front for selling things. They can also do the conversion from btc to cash.

If a company like apple doesn't meet your needs as a consumer, move to a company that will. Like Android. They carry wallets for Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Goldcoin and Feathercoin at the moment. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 05:36:24
Haha, sure. No contact info on the site, no guidelines, min or max bet. Games are nit updated. Looks like a crap chance of getting any coins out if this site if you win the bet.

@_date: 2014-07-22 14:45:09
I do the same, I'll spend my btc on things I would normally buy and resupply with the money I would if spent. My holdings go up and I end up with savings on the purchase. Currently I spend btc on flights the most.
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:37:14

I don't think anyone has. Sorry about your loss
@_date: 2014-02-27 09:49:57
Your asking for a 50+1% attack on the coin. A forced fork. This isn't the first time this idea has cone up from lost coins and every time, it gets shut down. Reason being is you could cause another or many other people to lose coins. It doesn't create a fair solution
@_date: 2014-02-12 19:13:13
Currently any transaction over $10000 is monitored, no warrant needed. It's a law that the banking system has already. They report any personal transaction over that amount. Now they will implement a way if doing that with cryptocurrency.

It's a coin that only exist on VoS. It represents a share of a mining farm that pays out based on how many divcoin you have. It can be sold on VoS for bitcoin also.

I join the mining pool and make a worker. After sending the worker info I can log back into the pool and see I am mining.

I am a huge fan of Android wallets for so many reasons. I can use them as cold storage on an old phone, they will never be effected by a fork because they always look for the longest blockchain, you don't have to sync the entire blockchain ever and they already have a QR code. Currently there is only 8 coins that have an android wallet. Bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin, feathercoin, goldcoin, digibyte, megacoin and copper. I'm waiting with my fingers crossed fir zetacoin and mostly reddcoin.

People use cloud mining because it might be hard to get btc any other way. They pay the higher price on speculation that the value will be higher than what they purchased for in some reasonable time frame.

@_date: 2014-04-29 18:00:27
I think it's very important for people to ask this every time you prefer to use btc over other payment options. How else will the merchants you deal with know how many customers they have that use btc?

It's cool, what device are you putting the wallet on?
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:37:22
There are a few good options for a wallet but all that is needed is a device. It's downloadable and every wallet will be unique. No ID or verification needed. That's one of the great things about Bitcoin

Once you have a wallet you can withdraw to that wallet. Turning into cash is easy as there lots of options. You can sell the coins to a friend, use a Bitcoin ATM, register to an exchange and sell them there. Plenty of options, some safer and some easier.

In Canada the buyer pays the tax when registering the car on either the sale value or the book value, which ever is higher. When I purchased a used car with Bitcoin, I just had to pay the tax on the book value of the car

Check out coinsquare.io since you’re Canadian.  To transfer coins to your wallet all you need is to provide your public key from that wallet. Buying from an ATM can cost more as there are hidden fees in the buy and sell price.
