So if you cannot redeem it for fiat then does it really even matter if it’s backed or not? I’ve only used it to hold my crypto during a dip. What other use is there?
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:36:04
I totally agree with you but what if something totally out of our control happens and the government decides to ban all crypto? I don’t think they’ll be able to but it would certainly cause a huge crash. Best not to go all in until things are more stable.

Haha everything on their subreddit is deleted. Looks like both sides are using it to continue the feud. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:55:58
cryptocompare.com has a good free one. I just started using cointracking.info which is free for the first 200 transactions you put in. Has a great app too and I’m currently watching all of my money wash away in real time with cool charts!

That was great. Never got around to watching this show. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:43:58
What about bitcoin and alt coins together equalling more than $10k? This only applies if all stored overseas?

Umm we just upgraded to LED monitors, next question. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:21:30

If it’s true then definitely, but I don’t see how they had this on him and then didn’t pursue and charges for this. Watch the documentary and it explains it in way more detail. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:46:46
They used this story to turn people against him knowing they would not sympathize with him if they thought this. They slandered his name but never brought formal charges or proof against him for this. It’s bullshit and really sad. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:41:22
There are some different options but they seem to be incredibly expensive for the time being. Here’s a great review:

I think we need a protest where everyone stops using non-segwit services so they get the message.  
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:32:44
I agree with lots of your points but what about diamonds, rubies, silver, down to all the cheaper metals and elements? I think these are a more accurate portrayal of the other coins. Right now bitcoin is the most valuable of them. The existence of coins might diminish its wealth some, but it also offers diversity. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:46:48
I really enjoyed the article just because of how positive it was. When explaining it to people who think it’s a Ponzi scheme I take this same approach. Keep it light and non-argumentative. Why wouldn’t you invest a portion  (not all) of your money in new technology? Isn’t it worth the risk for the possibility that this could change how we spend money and affect other things we can’t even imagine right now?

People in Venezuela sure are. And I am. It’s time for a system where we have control of ourselves, not these greedy fat fucks bribing our representatives. It’s blatantly obvious that they are continuously shaping the country to make it even better for themselves at the expense of everyone else. A new way of commerce will develop around these technologies, and it may not even be bitcoin that ultimately gets us there. People, especially the younger generation are getting fed up with a system we never agreed to. The cracks are everywhere, you just have to look. With the current administration, more people think this way than ever. I’m sure they don’t account for everyone who’s buying, but this is unique in that the entire world can join in on this together. There are no boundaries. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:49:39
Wouldn’t it be amazing if the government was run like a business and some branches actually generated a profit that went back to the taxpayers? Or it could be run for no/little profit like Amazon and could have stock value for investors. Not sure if that would be possible but I don’t see why not. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:27:37
If it depreciates then you can use it as a write off?
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:38:26
The accounts are linked but separate. You have to click withdraw in gdax and then you can move your Coinbase money over for free. If you are transferring to a wallet or another exchange you should transfer out of gdax as well because they have little to no fees   
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:50:59
Is there a service in Australia that does?
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:54:54
I wish there was a breakdown of how much of our own money went towards each aspect. Then you could choose not to pay money towards something you didn’t believe in. You still would have to pay the same amount but then everyone would actually be choosing what the government spends it’s money on.

Technology doesn’t get everything right from the start. Problems arise and are solved. The most intelligent young minds are now working on this and I have faith that they will come up with solutions very soon.

You can’t look at it as handouts to lazy individuals who will abuse the system. I’m sure there are some people who will, but that’s how it is with anything. You shouldn’t punish the rest of the population for the mistakes of the few. I see it as more for the people who are working their lives away day in and day out and still struggling to support their family. Some people have a great work ethic but live in an area where jobs are scarce. With the coming of automation and robots, there will soon be even less jobs, yet the population will continue to grow. This is a massive problem that must be solved now. From an economic standpoint, companies will begin to fail if a huge portion of the population can no longer afford to buy what they are selling. These small scale experiments assure we’ll be able to ease into a tested system instead of being forced into it when the time comes where there is no alternative. The program in Alaska is really interesting because it is funded by natural resources instead of taxes. Here’s a good article on it:

I believe in some cases they will also purchase actual bitcoins in order to hedge their bets, so they price will be directly affected. I’m no expert so if I have this wrong please correct me.

The percent of the population that own any bitcoin is still so small that I dot think we are even close to that yet. This attention is getting recognition real fast but there are still so many people who won’t do anything about it. We’ll see.

I would like to hear as well. I know some thieves have been using a virus that when you copy the send address it changes it to their address. I always check to make sure the first and last 3 digits match and always send a small amount first. Probably didn’t happen this way but this is a new one to me and I didn’t even consider it since it’s so simple. These people truly are scum and they will get what’s coming to them eventually. I had a friend who lost 100,000 with a crooked investor so it can always be worse. You just have to learn from your mistakes and move on. Don’t let this discourage you!

Yeah the fees are much higher with a credit card. The cheapest and quickest way is to wire the money directly from your bank to gdax.

Where do they get these stats? I have no doubt that it uses a ton of electricity but how does that compare to all the computers and servers used by all the banks in the world? All the energy used and the pollution caused by people who work at banks commuting to work, etc? We need to see the data from both sides on this before we worry about alarming headlines. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:46:49
Yeah if you buy with a limit order through gdax you pay $0 fees. Then you can transfer it to Coinbase or another wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:45:37
The scariest thing for me is that you could send it to the wrong address and it’s just gone.

Bitcoin is scarce though. The more popular it gets, the more people hear about it and want it. With gold and currency, more can be created or found. Bitcoin will never go past 21,000,000.

The cheapest and quickest way (besides a credit card but the fees are ridiculous) is to wire money from your bank account to gdax.com and then use a limit order to purchase the bitcoin with no fees. You’ll pay around $25 for the wire (depending on your bank).

So if I took mine out of Coinbase before the fork will I loose the bitcoin cash I’m supposed to get on Jan 1st? I want to take it out before the new fork but don’t want to lose the bch. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:06:25
Those threatened by the technology who pay off, sorry lobby the politicians do though. I don’t think they’ll ban it out right but there will be pressure to make it so they can control it.

I’m worried that if I take my coins out of Coinbase now before the fork, then I’ll lose the BCH that I will get on January 1st. Is that true?

What if I have BTC in Coinbase that still hasn’t spilt into BCH? They said they’ll start supporting it in January 1st and then the equivalent amount will show up in your account. If I take it out now and put it on a Trezor will I lose it? Or if I spend this will I also lose the equivalent BCH? Sorry for all the questions, pretty new at this.

I wouldn’t trust myself with that kind of money in one account. You’d have to split it up between a bunch of accounts just in case you made a stupid mistake and lose it all. Imagine if you mistakenly sent it to an ETH address.
