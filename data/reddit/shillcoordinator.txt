you are doing a fantastic job disrupting the Bitcoin community. Remember these key points:
* always inject negativity into Bitcoin discussions with sarcasm, ridicule and degradation
* always discourage Bitcoin supporters. One effective method is to repeatedly label supporters as "crazy", "loons", or a "cult". Belittle them as much as possible, to discourage people from wanting to be seen as supporting Bitcoin.
* always declare that Bitcoin is doomed to fail, to create doubt and uncertainty in Bitcoin's supporters. Remember, discourage discourage discourage
* always play down an achievement. If possible, find statistics or anecdotes that suggest the achievement is irrelevant
* insult and attack the reputation of key members of the Bitcoin community
