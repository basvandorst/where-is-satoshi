I do eBay dropshipping and BUY\\\\SELL quite a bit of gift cards, especially Amazon. I originally started a payments company and sold it a few years ago, and I run a channel called Adopted by Bitcoin exclusively focused on Payments.    
I’ve looked at all the gift card companies out there (Raise, Cardpool, CardCash, etc) but by far the simplest and best service I’ve found is -[Redeeem]( guys are great, the site is easy and beautiful, people are very honest. You can pay with PayPal or BitPay. Join their Redeeem Buyers for updates on new cards - they sell out quick, but they get more every day.They are really great if you buy a lot of Amazon cards over time, treat them with respect and don’t do anything shady to avoid being banned. They are a bunch of honest people.
