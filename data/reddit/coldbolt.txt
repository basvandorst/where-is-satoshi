I'm a novice and this is why I'll never be going to bitpay. If bitpay was the only way for me to get to my money, I would be royally screwed. Self management!!

The fact they can control your money and stop you from using your own money turns me off completely unless I'm catching on the wrong drift.

I don't use tor but I've been looking to for a while now. I have unlimited bandwidth usage and 2 internet connections.  How can I setup tor so it adds a hidden service relay. I'm a complete novice so forgive my stupidity

I'm guessing you want me to learn C because Bitcoin is written in it and also C is a component level program code? 
I guess it would make far more sense knowing C first before looking at Bitcoin so I can understand the small details about it.

We need more of this. I've seen a lot of UK based companies which don't add discounts to what is a transaction system which helps bring transaction costs down. Annoys me a lot.

I would have to look up some of the Bitcoin POS systems but if there are savings to be made, it should be added. The transaction fees are one of the bigger reasons to move to Bitcoin. Businesses which are ready to make more from these fees doesn't really make sense to me though as you have said, they are not obligated to reduce the fee.
However if everyone did reduce their product/service pricing based upon the savings of the fees, when that business/merchant has to pay for something, they would end up saving, making all purchases cheaper.
I am probably talking about things you already know but for me, the reduction of fees and elimination of exchange rate spreads, is what pushes me to use Bitcoin

In the short term, I agree but if people realise their Bolivars give them less and less and options online allow them to use their bitcoins for more and more uses, wouldn't more businesses be happy to start Bitcoins?
