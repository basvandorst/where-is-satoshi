No, but 6000/employee is 300 a year, a person in training might go through that in a month. Also I said I doubt they will use it all themselves, chances are they some will go to some police in anti-terror task forces, some to national guards and some to military-only areas.  


The world has been used rounds that were made almost 100 years ago. 9mm was made in 1902, the .223 in 1964 and the 5.56 not longer after, the .30-06 in 1906, the .308 Win in 1952.
With the standardizing among NATO countries to use 5.56x45mm, 7.62x51mm and 9mm. Chances are extremely high they will be using the same rounds 20 years from now.
They need to buy bulk for the prices, it's pointless to go year-by-year


Will never happen. That's a blatant violation of the 2nd amendment and be struck down so fast by the supreme court it'd make the president's head spin. 


The timeframe isn't relevant really, they can fit these in a warehouses and get them when they need them.
The industry has the capacity to do it in a year(they do 10billion/year in the US alone), but likely would span about 3-5 years for delivery

This article is bad.
1.6B rounds is a lot but really isn't that much in the grand scheme. It works out to about 6,000 per DHS employee which would be used up in about 20 years of training alone, and likely would not be all staying with them..
Not only that but buying in bulk and storing is an incredibly good idea due to the recent surge in ammo price(2013 is around when the prices went up), ammo can be stored basically forever(hell, ammo from 1960 is still used today by mosin nagant rifles) and 1.6B would cover them for a LONG time and not needing to do more purchases.
The idea that them having a lot of ammo isn't a bad thing, it's what they do with it should only matter. A guy with 20,000 rounds in his basement is harmless compared to the gang member with 10 rounds in his pistol firing at police.
The rest of the article babbles on about MRAPs and other crap to scare people.

Just because cyberspace is internationally reachable, does not mean breaking local laws is ok by operating an market for illegal items. For example, if you start selling modified weapons to be fully automatic and sold them online, do you really think that magically makes it legal because someone in Africa can view your page? Fuck no. 
Purposely facilitating illegal actions is illegal in the united states which ross lives and is a citizen of. He has no excuse and your argument is just plain stupid. 
The store selling vodka is not illegal to do, vodka is not illegal, drinking it is not illegal. Not of that is fucking true of what ross was doing. Selling drugs is illegal, drugs are illegal federally, having drugs is illegal and any store owner would be arrested if they sold drugs. 
You donating to freeross is a waste, all your doing is writing a check to his lawyer on a wbsite made by his lawyer written entirely by his lawyer.

No issues with the others, they just didn't want to take CS past probably the required for something else. That something else was likely Nursing, which was a pack class of 100% women.

If I made a comment in a random thread that just says "fuck bankers" or "fuck the state" that is me pandering because I know it will get a positive response, that doesn't make it a vetted comment. I could also say "the government is trying to bring down bitcoin" it will also get a ton of upvotes here because it panders but it is absolutely not vetted, it doesn't even need to be correct to get upvotes, it just needs to appeal.

Check is that the president has a max of 8 years in office, they can deny appointments until they are out.


That's an impossible problem to fix, we are by nature political and nothing will ever not be considered political by someone when it comes political-based positions. Who would make sure the third party is impartial? How do we make sure that person/group is also impartial? 


And they do by judging if something adheres to a laws or if something follows the constitution.
But you'll say "but they were appointed by X person!" Well, we can't have any ol' person say "ok, I'm judging now" and we can't do it in a machine way since it is normally a *judgement call* and that is currently the best solution, to have people who only have temporary power and must give it up if a majority of citizens don't like them or rules say they can't do it anymore.

This is NOT why people think it is a ponzi scheme.
They think it's a ponzi scheme because of it's users. Claims of "buy into it, you'll become rich" and "get your friends to use it and  you'll be even richer" a constant urging people to just buy buy buy, buy when it's down, buy when it up. People touting it as their retirement, etc, etc, etc.
Rarely does a bitcoin user merely mention what it can actually do, and even then it's not something that people care too much about:
* "Oh, I can send bitcoin around the world? So? I don't know anyone there..." 
* "I can already see my transaction history, why would I want to share it with the world?"
* "Fees? So now I have to pay *to pay for something*? Ok...
* "I have to do WHAT so I don't get robbed of them? Fuck that."
So in the end it's minimal benefit to most people, a hassle and to top it off the people who keep pushing it on them from the outside look like a ponzi scheme runners who constantly is pushing you to buy it and you know full well that they are doing that so they themselves make money. Looks shady as fuck.
You can talk in ideals all you like, but from what I see it's the users who are making it look bad and currently minimally benefiting features, not bitcoin itself. I know people here are going to refuse to accept that reality and will likely drivel on about conspiracies or some crap.

You're not understanding what I am saying.
Bitcoin being deflationary is a result of the protocol rules saying the rewards lower over time, a simply change to that rule makes bitcoin inflationary, not because "it was created as an international decentralized protocol for Internet "money" and transactions".
The network would not likely accept such a change to the rules and any blocks created following such a change would be rejected. But that isn't the point.
Inflationary altcoins like Dogecoin show that a coin can be made without "assigning trust to humans to determine what the global inflation rate should be each year".

That infrastructure isn't going to work or be destroyed if the world economy collapses.  A global collapse means a lot of people become desperate and a lot of people are going to turn to theft to get by. That powerline up there hasn't powered anything for month, if you cut off pieces, you could probably sell it.
It will likely be followed by a surge of violence from armed groups trying to use the collapse to their advantage, who will destroy said infrastructure too.
you're not going to have internet because the companies that ran it can't power their routers and their customers can't pay their bills. Your electricity will be gone for the same reason, no one can pay and the result of the collapse has means they can't pay to maintain your lines anymore.
Bitcoin is not going to matter when you have no way to communicate with the network, no way to do the heavy math on computers, no one will want a currency that is either unusable or extremely impractical.
A world collapse does just not mean everyone is poor, it means what you once knew of the world is no longer. Think the great depression of the US but many times worse and on a global scale. Bitcoin isn't magical, it won't save you from such an event.

No, I mean pessimistic. Whining about this and that, how nothing will change, nothing will improve, the government is terrible it will never get better, blah blah blah.
Of course nothing will improve when you sit on your fat ass and complain on the internet you unmotivated bastards. Your grandpa fought for  what he believed in, many died for it, you think pressing 'like' and using a different currency is somehow proactive to an issue.
Bitcoin is not some savoir to your problems with banks or your current governance, it's a fucking currency.

I don't think phones have hardware RNGs, and even if it did it doesnt matter because any reasonable developer of random functions fill their pool from various sources, so even if it was backdoored it would just add to the entropy pool.

I don't know why everyone seems to mock CNBC, I've watched several of their segments on bitcoin over the last year and it's always pretty balanced and can be summed up like this:
* They don't fully understand bitcoin and how it functions, which is true for a hell of a lot of people
*  They don't dismiss bitcoin just becuase they don't understand it and have been pretty amazed by it's performance .
* Debates are not one sided, they have people on both sides of the argument when they have a real discussion on it
* They don't throw in an opinion when simply reporting news on bitcoin("Overstock now says they are accepting bitcoin starting today", "The chinese bitcoin exchange say they are closing"), they just read it and move on.
* Anchors tend to differ on their opinion, some think it might turn out to be something pretty big in the future, others simply don't believe it will take root and might fall out in use/worth for various reasons
* No one says "this is stupid!" or something.
Side thought: Have you noticed that 99% of the bitcoin shows, blogs, etc. are never like this? always one sided.
Of course, knowing this subreddit, if they aren't saying it will keep going up for ever and ever and will take over the world and be the answer to everything, they're just "spreading FUD!".

Here votes are counted by machines and counted by hand when there is possible issue(lightly filled in, bad handwriting for write-in)  by a registered Republican, Democrat, **and independent** to determine what the vote was. 
I guess that doesn't matter to you though since you're already in the attitude of everything is a lie. It's not surprising you both don't even know how votes are counted, even in your own state, since 99% of the info you listen to is likely from blogs and youtube.

We have been the whole time, yet people here routinely don't vote saying their vote doesn't matter and complain that the government doesn't represent them enough, all because they didn't vote.

It will be different because they will be building it on private land everytime, and everyone who owns that land will dictate how it is built because they will be paying for it. You can't force the roads to be built on their land and you can't force them to pay a certain amount, or you'd go against what you just said. So you'd have to build around their land at varying angles, and that takes more road potentially lowering in quality because the person who owns that land is paying for it. Not to mention you'd have dead ends everywhere from people who don't want it on their land.

You are not understanding what money laundering is then, it is the financial equivalent of destruction of evidence. No one is banning the use of money, same as no one is banning eating. But if you use eating or the use of money to cover up a crime, that's the problem.
Both are for covering up a crime.
Both need an original crime.
Both can have victims of the crime they cover up.
Somehow you aren't ok with destruction of evidence but money laundering you take issue with. When someone commits destruction of evidence by bleaching a room after beating some up, it makes sense? But when some launders money by saying it's profits of a storefront rather than from extortion, it doesn't make sense?

Yes, and since then we've ran on a representative model where people, elected by majority vote, impose a tax when other representatives agree by again a majority vote. Thus the tax was imposed under the consent of the people via their representatives.
Even direct democracy (aka big petition, like in CA), can impose a tax, which would also be consent.
That's why the saying "No taxation without representation!" existed, it was for that very line you quoted, they weren't against taxation, just taxation they have no say in.

Money laundering is only a crime in addition to another crime. To convict some of money laundering you first have to have the original crime proven since money laundering is the act of covering up a crime(or knowingly cover up someone else's crime) 
It is not about tracking transactions, it's about the prevention of evidence destruction. 
One is suspected of money laundering when they behave like they are,  same as you suspect someone dragging a body bag while covered in blood may have killed someone.

Then the company shuts down cause it's more profitable to not sell things and no one is buying anyway. People stop producing products and no one buys anything and all things begin to fall apart due to no economy existing.

No it doesn't encourage growth, it does literally zero to help spread bitcoin. With bitpay and such, all you end up with is bitpay having a ton of bitcoins, you having fewer, and the business getting none.
Without the business getting bitcoin, they don't have a chance to pay their supplier with bitcoin, who in turn don't have bitcoin to possibly pay their material providers and all along the way no chance to pay their employees who again don't have a chance of buying from other businesses.
The difference with dollars is they actually flow around, which helps it's constant use as a value medium. Using bitpay to buy stuff is no different than selling your old hot wheels on ebay and purchasing pizza with the cash. The business never see the hotwheels and thus mean nothing to them, does that mean hot wheels are growing as a currency? No.
If you want bitcoin to grow, it's use to just be instantly converted does jack shit for it, only it's direct use to a business, them holding it, giving them a chance to make the decision to pass it on rather than sell it off is what will help it.
I need to make a shitty animation to explain someday because it seems no understands how little bitpay and such services do for bitcoin.

Who is going to repair a mistakenly cut fiber line? A repairman? The fiber company can't  afford to hire enough to maintain the fiber lines fully and when much fewer people pay for the service. That large network of fiber will still cost the same to maintain. 
The companies that make that fiber will also be affected and a lot of the facoties might close, driving up the cost of replacement fiber and equipment.
Sections of that fiber network will be abandoned due to low subscriber numbers as it just costs too much to supply them with internet when so few use it.Those subscribers can't pay more for the internet instead, they too are affected by the world collapse. Raising the rates will just further lower the subscriber count while still having a large network to maintain and even less funds to maintain it.

Not true at all, no crash has been from any of that. It's all over speculation, followed swiftly by suicidal morons who put life savings into something they barely understand. It's always people buying too much with no actually reasoning to why it's that much, so it crashes.


crashing lessening from 80% to 75% is barely an accomplishment. World economy was in a decade long depression over 20% in a week.


No, because hyperdeflation is fucking bad, the people in this subreddit think it isn't because they simply see that the money they have is gaining in value, ignoring that such deflation would halt economic activity as people begin to horde, nothing will be produced because you paid .5 btc to make a car and when it's done, it's only worth .1btc. You'd have been better off not making a car at all.
Anyone shouting "New Paradigm" or "new world order" are mindless idiots, ignore them. They're part of the political horde that are blinded by feelings who likely came in during sharp rises.

They seized the coins because they were used in said illegal act, just as they seize papers, notes, bags, knives, servers, pens, guns, etc. The simple act of seizing something doesn't not give it actual recognized value, only it's value in proving a case.

Why not head on over to Nigeria and get kidnapped, ethically cleansed, burned for being gay, what ever is happening that week.
Oh, how about Mexico and be kidnapped as well, except you'll be killed and have your body cut up and your limps thrown in a sack and delivered to your families home.
What about china, you could work 20 hour shifts and make $1/hr, sounds like fun!
There's always North Korea, say anything bad and you and your family have a all expenses paid trip to the work camps and put to death! Exciting!
Or Iraq where you can, yet again be kidnapped, but this time you are put in front of a camera, some words are said loudly, and you are beheaded with a rusty blade. Of course, the video will get passed around on the internet.

You basically have no idea how people work, period. No one is going to create a police force without it being abused in some way. You think the people are all good inside or something, yet you can go out to most middle east countries and you can see what happens when people gather up to uphold what they believe is right when there is no government around.
You also have no idea what happens in law enforcement, they rarely go after any media piracy and in fact have only had a handful of cases. Patent laws aren't even criminal laws, they're civil, the police don't even get involved in that ever. At no point have policed been involved in "children playing war" or "drawing a gun on paper", not once, ever. If you seriously think that is what they focus on, you don't know shit. As for drug laws, most are not actively gone after unless the amount is huge, like those from drug cartels, normally it's an added on to the charges things, not a go out and break down your door for smoking one joint.

I come here because I want to hear about bitcoin news, talk about bitcoin. Of course I make the mistake of not sucking everyone's political dick when I do and arguments happen a lot. But I also don't want to sit idly by while the community decays even more.
Back in the day bitcoin was a neat concept put together by satoshi that people thought it could work out to be something good in the future but all in all an experiment.
Now bitcoin is claimed to be every political views brainchild and based on their ideology and will take over the world and solve all problems and create world peace and satoshi is a magical being/group that created bitcoin to destroy all governments.

If some of your applications are looking for bitcoin wallets on your computer, you're already fucked if you open in any method, because they WILL be looking through your RAM too. Truecrypt never writes plaintext to the disk either.
Also, it's kind of pointless as you can't even use that private key if it's in keepass, and the whole point of decrypting it is to use it. If you're going to use it it doesn't matter how it's stored.

You mean destruction of evidence? Yes, that can give you jail time. People do it all the time when being arrested to swallow drugs, money or whatever they can. You want to just say "ok, it's fine to eat things to cover up a crime"?
Look, listen to what you are even saying. The Mafia uses money laundering all the to to cover up some horrible shit, cartels are even worse by using it to cover up countless murders.
Money laundering not existing means no punishment for financially covering up a crime, the bankers you probably hate so much would use it to no end, it's used to funnel money to terrorist groups in the middle east and slavery and sex trade in africa.
You want that punishment gone, all because of one guy you want to not go to jail.

Take Dell, currently everyone is in love with them for accepting bitcoins, CEO is saying bitcoins is awesome, everyone should accept bitcoin. They love bitcoin *so much* they teamed up with coinbase so every time someone pays in bitcoin, they don't ever have to touch it or get it, they get USD.
Let's say some sells something, dudes comes up and says "do you accept gold?", "Sure, gold is amazing! I love it so much! Everyone should use it!", so he hands him the gold "Whoa, not me.

You put .5btc into making a car. In that time bitcoin has risen, the final car is only worth .1btc as a result. The cars value has not changed, it's worth in exchange for btc has.
If you had done nothing, you would have still had .5btc rather than .1btc.
This would apply to many industries and we would have a massive economic shutdown as it would be better to do nothing than something. This economic shutdown would also have wide reaching affects, world hunger would spike for instance as food industry would make more money not making food.
You have to think about this more than just yourself, the ideal situtaion would be minor deflation, one or two percent a year would doable. The purpose of money is to be a store of value, not a value modifier.

No, it's entirely possible, Maybe if you want to be a bitch about inconvenience of using it, but you don't need banks for anything.


Get a check, cash at walmart or some shit. Direct deposit is just a convenience option.


No it isn't, while it can be considered a reason for suspicion for some drug laws, it is not, and never will be, a crime. How would large cash movers like garda even exist if that were true?


Why wouldn't it, it might be an old dusty route to pay directly in cash, but it has to be possible, head to your local IRS branch, ask to pay there, what are they going to do, say no to money? At worst, get a cashiers check.


Since when is credit history a requirement of anything? It is entirely possible for you buy what you can afford with what cash you have.
This is the problem I have with a lot of bitcoin users, you're fucking idiots. You think banks run things, they don't, you just keep using them so they keep being involved with things and think any problems you have with them is because of USD, not taking the few seconds to rub a brain cell together to separate money, from large money holders and the profit driven business that they are.
A bank is not there to serve you as some public service, they are a business just like mcdonalds or Walmart or Home Depot, they are there to make money. There is no requirement to use their services, you just keep using them and then bitch about using them.

Reading this the wiki says: 
    priority = sum(input_value_in_base_units * input_age)/size_in_bytes
"Transactions need to have a priority above 57,600,000 to avoid the enforced limit (as of client version 0.3.21)." do you know what this "enforced limit" means?
As the input ages, it should increase in priority enough to make it in.

It's a subreddit based on money, that has users give out money for the smallest things or for sharing an opinion, this is incredibly easy to game and from the money involved, mildly lucrative.
Ever since tipping was started, the number of posts that either pander to the community by parroting talking points or sob stories and plain view addresses/QR codes have skyrocketed and take up like 1/3 of this subreddit at any given time.

And yes, the market is small, bitcoin economy makes up some 0.0067% or so of the worold economy last I looked.
But, you could just make a post of your business and be yet another fake acceptor of bitcoin by using coinbase or bitpay and never ever ever touch, or contribute to the use of, bitcoin.

Here's the thing, the system was designed that every user would be a node, this whole SPV and other crap wasn't around. It made sense when the blockchain was only 20MB or so. Now keeping up with 1MB every 10 minutes is not.
It was also deigned that there would be a lot of miners would would be full modes while mining. This has also changed, people don't mine on thier own, they join pools. The ASICs mean the barrier to become a miner is very high.

Also the basis of this article is the whole "inactivity after 5 years are transferred to the state", the author *clearly* has no idea how this works, at all. It is transferred to the state for **YOU** to reclaim after the bank/company have made reasonable contact you about it, it's a protection from inactivity fees and general burden to the company. [New york even has a video to explain this process.]( Sometimes it is auctioned off because storing it can be expensive(I think items of considerable value aren't auctioned) 
here's more info on this 
Secondly, this isn't a change to bitcoin suggestion, but policies of a coinbase and such who hold bitcoin for others.

You know, key tech hasn't stood still since they were first made. 
Cars these days don't have standard keys, you can't just make a copy of it and drive with it, no, they have chips in the hand part and without that the car isn't doing to do anything. 
Fancy cars have keys that just need to be within a few feet and you can star the car and drive. 
Your idea can be made sooooo much more simpler where it is just a device that merely attempts to establish a encrypted connection through public-key(it holds a private key) to send commands to devices that have authorized the keyfob and the keyfob have  authorized. I don't see what benefit a blockchain would have.

Neither of these is because of bitcoin directly. Bitpay has no fee for the merchant because they are betting on bitcoin's worth to increase, it is not because of the lower fees built into bitcoin. Free press is not a feature of bitcoin....
Also, start supporting your claims that I'm wrong. I've noticed a lot of people in bitcoin tend to shrug off backing things up, it's a dick move. Clearly you are a pedophile, why? I'm not going to explain because it's so obvious that you are, far too trivial to prove!

So, his company now takes bitcoin, he stands to gain a few million for his company, what are the chances that him saying he loves math is just to pander to the groups holding bitcoin and make them think "this dude is like us! we should spend our money there!"
Your quote of ""Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are going to be around for as long as the law of mathematics works." is another pandering to the target group, it's a common line used by bitcoin people.

What is wrong with a tor node wanting to block something going through **their** computer and network? It is **their** connection you're using and are under no obligation to forward any traffic to you in the first place while they risk themselves, and you're still free to use a different node.
EDIT: I like how personal property rights(that libertarians are so crazy about) are conditional around here depending on if someone else's property benefits you or not.

If you sign up with a bank, you gave up your right to financial privacy there. Get over it, if you want privacy don't go to a company and expect it as none of them are under any obligation to give it to you unless it's medical.


Where is it illegal? start quoting some laws. The only thing illegal is hiding a crime, and that is exact what money laundering is, hiding another crime. It's destruction of evidence basically. Al Capone and other early gangster used money laundering to hide murder, extortion, theft,  and other crimes and couldn't be caught as they have no way to prove the money came from thier illegal activities, it was all made to look clean at their other "totally legitimate" businesses.

A bitcoin isn't anything, you merely have private keys that say "I own X bitcoins, here is my public key to prove it, which the block chain says I own" if someone trys to spend more than they own with a key the netwrok just says "uh... no, the blockchain says you own have X....."

hyperdeflation would be horrible in a single world currency, in your mind it might sound nice but in reality it kills your economy. poor get richer, richer get super rich, but it means nothing without something to spent that money on.
Slight deflation where it benefits savings but not enough to outpace profit from contributing to the economy and other general investment is doable. Maybe 1% a year, yes saving helps but you can invest or start a business and do even better.

I find that extremely hard to believe, pre-December it was a huge amount of the comments around here


No it's because I know how it used to be, people liked bitcoin but were calm about it. People "tipped" eachother mostly to repay helping them or to get others started, not because they made some comment that panders to the community. There wasn't a witch hunt everyweek. Altcoins were interesting, not considered "the enemy". Everyone had their own politics they followed but no one was so vitriol about it as they are now. No one has this "either you're with us, or against us" attitude.
Then the first crash happened in 2011 and everyone came in, the greedy, the political zealots, the paranoid, all flowed in and turn this community into what it is today. A community centered around who can be the most extreme or hate something the most. A community of people who claim bitcoin as their political group's creation. A community that attacks anyone who doesn't share the same politics as them.

People hate things, people who hate things tends to be vocal about and even dedicate time to not liking something. We had two world wars on the basis of hating something and expressing that hate.

The comments of this thread is filled with hate of people who hate bitcoin, and you are very vocal about that hate. We have weekly witch hunts about our hate of someone. Constant threads about our hate of a company or of regulation, again very vocal and dedicate time to that hate.

Anarchy people aren't any better either, they hide behind the concepts of peace and love like they came right from the 70s, like they are on a PR campaign to rebrand themselves and make everyone like them, suddenly [denouncing any violent anarchy as not real anarchy]( Reality is they're all talk and no action and any anarchy action somehow keeps being violent acts(Odd how a group about peace has memebers that keep being voilent...). Take away the doubletalk and hippy ideals, and it's your generic angsty teen/young adult.

Look, I've been around bitcoin since you just became legally allowed to strip on the internet, and losing bitcoin because of glitches or security of the way you hold them, while not an issue of the underlying bitcoin system, is still coins being lost because of the way bitcoin is used.
The problem that you lose bitcoins, be they change or life savings, because you slip up or a dev made an off by one error or a servive fucked up, is something that may never disappear. Just because bitcoin itself didn't cause it it doesn't mean it isn't an inherit issue that should be ignored and cast aside.
If a climber dies in an avalanche, yeah his pick and rope worked right but the risk of dealing with a mountain isn't something to ignore.

To issue an alert, they'd have to have the private key, not an easy thing to get.

You know, about two years I got fed up with r/bitcoin's constant manufactured bullshit  so I have no idea what you mean by it'd be a problem gavin, the lead developer of bitcoin core and one of the last non-crazy people around bitcoin, if he had the key to the alert system, the system he has ONLY used for security notices, a forking incident  and a protocol change.
Pray tell, why would this be an issue? What grand scheme has r/bitcoin cooked up to hammer the guy who is basically the reason bitcoin is even still around today?
@_date: 2016-03-24 05:33:39
Because it isn't centralization.
1. the alerts do not affect bitcoin itself
2. bitcoin itself does not force you to heed or even know about alerts
3. it only works(unless added) in one client, any other client maker could add the same system really
There is no control the alerts do, they just pop up a message.... and that's it. It used to make the client go into safe mode but that was added and removed years ago.
centralization requires control over the flow and function, which the alerts do neither.

There is a difference between caring for something and greedy obsession and zealous behavior towards anyone who hints at dissenting from the popular opinion here. To say anything against bitcoin in any form is up there with blasphemy in the middle ages.
I remember when bitcoin was still young and people cared about it because it could become something good, they didn't sink their lives into it like today because it could make them rich.
The community today doesn't care about bitcoin, it could have been litecoin or dogecoin, all they care about is being richer. 5 years I've seen it turn into this, this group of people here for extreme political reasons, financial benefit reasons, they don't care about what it is only what it will do for their agenda.

Let's not forget those people can't even use bitcoin because of the fees to buy anything, so they'd need to convert to local currency.
Oh wait almost no one does that, maybe not for 1000 miles. So you walk or drive there to convert your $20... sorry $18 because of the exchange fee or price movement, and the $2 to send that bitcoin to the exchange.

Mesh networks of these type.
They're incredibly slow, high latency from the sheer number of hops, massive complicated, and full of gaps. Every single mesh network project likes piggyback off ISP of users, without it you get the problems above.
Not only that but for the mesh network to be viable without ISPs, you need a HUGE user base(I'm talking in the low percent of the *world population*) to even get some remote sense of "usable". Which isn't going to happen because no one will join something that simply doesn't work with a small amount of users, it will have no network effect.)
Mesh networks just aren't viable, but they remain a tech dream.

Multisig is about the only major thing to really come out, what people tend to tout is how we have coinbase and such, companies we'll probably hate soon enough and maybe go out of business. 
We hype up bitcoin far too much, make too many "in the future"  statements, sell it like a cure for cancer. More things to to be done, like actually working and in use, before we get ahead of ourselves. 
We also need to stop acting like bitcoin is a world renowned currency with acceptance at every corner, it isn't, fact is people have have huge marketing campaign to even get a few purchases with it along with a heavy discount  that people will demand since it is supposedly saving them money.

They never did in the first place. but if you want an CA to vouch for your cert being the one that actually belongs to the website, it does cost money.
Let's encrypt is basically gives certs by an automated process with little real verification, if a hacker manages to take over your domain *once* they can generate a completely valid cert for your domain for however long. the domain over can't even get it revoked if they wanted to.

I don't know anything about NewsBTC but I'm sure it's shit too. It's just yet another junk bitcoin site mad at yet another junk bitcoin site. It's standard petty bickering and shit throwing that after 4 years I seen become the constant.
So again, I don't care about either of these websites.

Risk is usually the reason.

No, the gif should loop once and then crash your browser and have a broken color palette. Followed by a three paragraph write up on how the gif will change EVERYTHING once it done and has a large number of highly skilled programmers working day and night to finish it. It skyrocket bitcoin to $10,000/BTC by the end of the year. Of course the government will be afraid of the amazing gif this will become that they will try to stop it and arrest anyone attempting to use it. Bankers will begin crying at the sight of the gif as the people slowly regain power over them using the gif once it is finished.
This decentralized gif will be amazing for remittance.

Don't quit working on stuff, but shut the fucking hell up about the 101 projects that have yet to have anything to show for or applying everything you do based on what those projects *might* do, that is if they ever happen.
You know how much of "The price of bitcoin with be X by next year" hinges on these projects that have accomplishments of "it builds"? Like fucking 95% of them. Do you know how many security plans to protect your bitcoins based on projects that don't even work yet? Like 80% of them.

As it is right now, 
1. Bitcoin is beat by normal currencies in terms of speed of normal, everyday transactions; I could hand someone a dollar and they could instantly spend it, or pass it to another person and pass it to another in a matter of seconds. that isn't going to happen with bitcoins, it's inherently slow with casual transactions. Bitcoin is only fast in starting a transaction over a distance, everything else is damn slow.
2. Bitcoin also doesn't beat normal currency in terms of practical use across distance, I could buy almost anything online with a credit card with a fraction of a percent in fees. While it may seem fast, I bet most dealers will wait for confirmations before they go ahead with your order, while a credit card orders will be confirmed in batches every hour or so.
Where Bitcoin wins is international transferring of money and ignoring of borders and person-to-person over distance, which is pretty rare thing to do, how often do you need to spend $40 to a guy in Algeria or Laos? You're most likely to buy from a nearby store or a online shop. So while it has that, it's not common.
While Bitcoin does make it impossible to counterfeit, the means that check for fake transactions means you have to wait, and people can't *just wait* these days. If you want to skip confirmations and processing, there is a need of trust between you and the entity you're buying from. Hard to gain that trust with strangers with a currency that is meant to not be possible to force transferring of money.
Also for volume, in currency the more volume the better, it is nothing like email, I don't need an email to feed myself, I don't need an email to get paid, email is entirely different.
I like bitcoin, I have 14BTC from somewhat-early days of mining, but I'm not going to kid myself and think that it is perfect, that one plus here ignores everything that needs improving,

Gains and loses SHOULD NOT be involved in the medium of an economy, it is basically poison to it. It either encourages hording, or encourages getting rid of it. As a currency, that is bad bad bad bad bad **baaaaaad!!!**
As a trader of BTC, you probably see that as a good thing, but it isn't when it comes to bitcoin's use as a currency. My point is that volatility needs to settle or bitcoin will never be used for it's purpose.

I've been around for every bubble, from 2011, April 2013, and now.
The community goes batshit crazy every time, people claim that bitcoin with hit outragous amount like $1000 in a few months(every crash has had that line, 2 crashes later and still is wrong)
The community focuses on bitcoin like some god, thou shall praise it, thou shall not speak blasphemy, thou shall not hold other false currencies, resist the devil in washington, and give thanks to satoshi who arth in heaven. 
My major problem with the community is to ignore criticism, people think bitcoin is perfect as it, conceptually it's pretty good, practically it has a ton of faults that need to be addressed:
* offline bitcoin transactions has no good solutions, bitcoins is basically useless in 3rd world countries, no paper money can't fix that as you can't trust it is real and can't verify without a computer.
* confirmations are a problem for quick transactions like buying food as you can't simply wait for it to verify, if you say "oh it'll be fine, attacks are too hard", you're putting trust in a supposedly trustless system.
* Security is extreme and is still not good enough, as in, how careful you have to be with bitcoin storage. If cash is risky and unsafe, bitcoin is a game of Russian roulette with only one empty chamber.
* you may be able to send 1BTC to someone around the world really fast and for a low/no fee, but sending 1BTC to someone in person is SLOW compared to the split second transfer of cash, plus there is a possible fee.
But no, "we're all going to be rich, motherfuckers!" is the ruling tone, not improvement.

There is no way bitcoin is even going to keep someone alive cause the incredibly vast majority of businesses don't accept it right now, you could name one business that does and you could easily name 100,000 that don't.
Can you buy food within 100 miles using bitcoin? probably not. Can you pay for electricity with bitcoin? No. Can youpay taxes in bitcoin? No. Can you pay for school in bitcoin? No. Pay for gas?

Sign this, it's from the abstract with added randomness
 A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic ZJJpLjCjj7LsQm2jAavBcash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted lUl2TUEpeWV4KnkTlhqg third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a igmBoPkPA0AXMptIyAGN record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. V1N9WLVwAG4FjFZuUylk The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-eEu4V1rnXx6OQxmuoK6Lwork chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.

@_date: 2013-03-11 02:01:59
It does not make economies collapse, it does not cause sudden hyperinflation when the currency is at this scale.
They've been saying everything is going to hyperinflate since right before the crash of 2011, it hasn't happened, it hasn't shown it's going to happen. As far as everything shows right now, economies are reasonably stable and bitcoin is the scary looking currency with it's spike and crashes.
You've been living with fiat for hundreds of years, why does it seem in the last 4 years, since bitcoin was made, that suddenly everything *but bitcoin* is going to collapse. Bitcoin is not a perfect currency, it's affected by world economics too.

The industry was never against digital music, considering CDs are digital versions of the music and they came out in the 80's.
This "thought file sharing was a fluke, nobody would want a digital file of an artist." is a flat out lie, they wanted the copying of the music that they sell to stop since it was the same as if someone took one vinyl and then handed them out to hundreds of people.

different compiler versions mean different sizes, different settings you have mean different sizes, your installed version of a framework among various other versions of other frameworks needed, statically linked libraries(like those included in a linux binary) versus dynamically linked libraries(your compiled one using libraries on the system, not it's own personal one).
That just some of the many reasons why, you have to be very exact to get exact matching binaries that other people made

Only one cryptographic algorithm is being ran, SHA-256.


Since the miners are normally open source, yes we do know.


As I said, miners are normally opensource, those that aren't are shunned.
Bitcoin in a nutshell: miners work by hashing numbers and looking for a valid awnser, it's predictable how long it will take for that to happen, someone ends up finding it and as a reward, they control 25 bitcoins(used to be 50, it halves every [very many]). users get bitcoin by either mining or exchange goods and services, then they control those bitcoins through keys(stored in wall.dat). Bitcoin right now is risky, volatile and in it's infancy, it may not even work out in the end(despite what this subreddit might think). If you want to get into it, know the risk and get a basic understanding of securing your coins(for example, you delete your wallet, your coins are gone, gone-gone, it's near impossible to get back.)

You should probably aim for businesses first before users, if trying to get female users on board to gain  more female focused products for bitcoin you'll probably get a lot of "what's the point if I can't get anything I want?", getting businesses that cater to female focused products means you'll have a foundation for the users to use, you know "build it and they will come".

No. A block with the transaction need to be made for you to truely trust that the transaction happened, they have been slowed down by:
* Luck, may take longer than average for a block to be made
* Miner didn't include your transaction for one of various reasons (huge (as in data) transaction size for one). That could push your transaction to many days of no confirmations.
so you either have to trust that the transaction is valid, or make the customer wait.
Litecoin did try to change this by speeding it up block generation.

Two weeks is the average time it takes for 2016 blocks to be made
If 3/4 of the hashing power disappears, suddenly it takes 4x longer to make a block, 4x longer for the difficulty to change to adjust for this lower hashing power. So it's take 8 weeks for the network to adjust
If we drop 9/10 of the hashing power, it takes on average 65.2 minutes for blocks to be made(based on the blockchain.info's 6.52min average now), it will take 40 weeks for the difficulty to adjust.

Your whole point would be valid if we were talking about guns obtained legally.
But we aren't talking about legal guns. From guns with filed down numbers to suppressors, SBRs, and automatic medications. When you enter the zone of illegal weapons, the whole "it's just a tool" speech loses it's meaning. If someone is getting thier guns off a black market site rather than the legal means of even a private party sale, you better believe that there is something else going on.
Go ahead and give the same speech to guys purchasing crates of AK-47s in Somalia from various smuggling and bribes, are you going to say those guns are meant to be victimless too? What about the one of the mexican cartels? Still "just a hammer" there?

Also just because fiat money isn't perfect doesn't mean it doesn't work, I can feed myself on USD, not Bitcoins. If anyone has a narrow view of the world, it's you.

I still don't count this as using bitcoins to buy things, it really annoys me when people say they bought X with bitcoins and then have some footnote that they used your service. It's like saying you bought a Laptop with gold but you have to go out and sell your gold first.

No I don't.
But let's say you had a backup before you sent .50BTC, then recieved .25BTC. You'd have in your current wallet .75BTC, but in your backup wallet you'd have [0-0.50BTC]+.25BTC. 
That's because you likely need to break up some of your coins to make the transaction, like in the link, you wanted to send .5, but only had an exact 1BTC, so you broke that up into two .50BTC, one goes to the reciever, the other invisibly gets sent to an address(which isn't shown in bitcoinQT), that address(and it's private keys) get added to your wallet, thus you have left .50.
But wait! You backup has no record of that change! According to the blockchain 1BTC was spent, .50BTC sent to one address, .50BTC sent to another, but you don't have keys, thus ownership, of either in that wallet

It's your own faults, maybe if people actually spent bitcoins on the humble bundles, they would. But people don't.
There is a somewhat old post that shows how little people were using bitcoin.
The guy doesn't touch on the overall comparison of the purchases, but 729 purchases with bitcoin is the number that's important. Sounds like a lot but it isn't. windows alone had 113057 purchases, if all 729 bitcoiners said they used windows, they'd make up 0.6% of Windows buyers.
That is tiny, so why program in the functionality of paying with bitcoins if basically no one is paying in bitcoins?

In South Korea, a lot of people think that fans remove oxygen from the air, clearly a lot of people think it so it means it's likely true?
In some sub-Saharan countries, having sex with a virgin will remove your AIDS, does the mass belief of that make it closer to true?

NEWS FLASH, the CIA has connections with anyone big, it's their fucking job to. The list of people who they have been in contact with and them not go and murder people would span thousands of pages. How they can be held responsible for them going crazy is beyond me. Do you blame the teachers of students who went on to commit crimes? Do you blame the friends of people who killed someone?
But if it's the US and one CIA member had a meeting with them decades before, then it's like they killed all those people themselves, right?!?!

Silkroad didn't just do weed, they did meth, cocaine and various others that are usually sourced from cartels. opiates for example are rarely "homegrown" and normally from the middle east. 
And unless they banned it at some point, they used to sell much worse products including yellowcake uranium, weapons, various forgeries.

Silk Road's closure was not because of bitcoin or it's use there, if they used USD, they'd still be shutdown. DPR is not in trouble for using bitcoin. I am talking directly about bitcoin, not things that involve it.
Every time I come to this subreddit, it's a bunch of self-made drama and narratives that everyone is out to get them because they use bitcoin, reality is no one cares. bitcoin is so small that it doesn't even register in the economy, governments that are supposedly have bitcoin on their  to do list probably don't give a damn, they've got two wars going on and two countries that are working on nuclear weapons, they don't fucking care that you're using bitcoin. Bitcoin's entire market value is just a bit more than the US government spends in one hour. You're not important as you all think you are.
No one has been arrested, tried or convicted of using bitcoin. People have been arrested, tried and maybe convicted for avoiding taxes and think cause they use bitcoin they don't have to pay it.


I've got a ton of shitty things going on in the real world of reality, things that can't just have a "huehue bitcoin user unaffected", and coming here to hear you guys complain about how "oppressed" you are really pisses me off.

That isn't how the difficulty works.
The difficulty is based on how long it takes to make 2016 blocks, which is on average 2 weeks, if it takes more than 2 weeks, the difficulty goes down, if it takes less, the difficulty goes up.
A loss of network hash rate means it takes longer to generate those 2016 blocks, thus longer to adjust the difficulty to a lower amount.
I;m not talking about it actually happening, I'm saying if no one mines, bitcoin dies, if few people mine after'MANY people leave, Adjusting for such will take a long time and take a long time tof or new bloacks to be made.

This is why volatility is so incredibly bad for bitcoin, in a stable currency, you can have back and forth transactions and no one fears losing money, as over time nothing changes.
This is why USD is liked so much, yes it has inflation, but it only 2-6% A YEAR, Bitcoin moves that much in half an hour. It's as stable as a concrete floor.

They could not have any value if that person wanted to get rid of them and you'd just be willing to pay for them.

Not using your service, it's annoying when people use your service and then claim "Bitcoin is amazing, everyone is accepting it now!" ignoring the fact it had to go through a proxy.


No they are not, they are paying you to pay the merchant in USD.
There is nothing wrong with your service, what is wrong is people's concept of the service, that using it means that they buying something in bitcoins,  giving people the idea that bitcoins is becoming more accepted when really an exchange is still needed.
Bitcoins success is reliant of it's direct use, not use by proxy. People around here need to understand the difference.

There is **so much incorrect** here, how does one even start?


* RMS did not create "GNU/Linux", as it is merely a term, he very much did not create Linux, only GNU.


* GNU is not Linux and Linux is not GNU. GNU is a project that develops various tools, originally starting out as a project to make a free OS but the kernel(Hurd) was never finished.


* Linux is not an OS, it *is* the kernel. GNU is the tools, gcc, toolchain, coreutils, etc. 


* GNU/Linux is the term coined by RMS about OS that use GNU components and a Linux kernel, where did you get "GNU/Linux **OSU**"?

Except with cash, there isn't zero confirmations. You're handed a dollar and in a split second you can confirm most things that can prove a transaction took place with real money; the color, the feel, the material, does it feel right, is it smeared, does it look right. In larger amounts there is security built in, water mark, micro-print, colored fibers, that marker thing. Bitcoin doesn't have that luxury and there is a moment of trust that you aren't lieing through something like a race attack to double-spend.

This isn't real adoption which is my whole problem with it.
Stability comes from adoption and it's continued use by those who receive it for when they buy stuff since it starts flowing through the economy and begins leveling out the price, *that doesn't happen with this instant conversion*. It literally goes to a few companies who in turn sell it on an exchange, businesses never see  a bitcoin, neither does anyone they do business with. Bitcoin's economy  does not improve with that system in the least.

No, I don't agree with you, cause you are saying they take your car away because you stop paying them money, and that's it, it isn't that simple.
They take your car away cause stop following the laws that are in place for your use of the road, **a road you do not own in any part**, but since you want to **use what you own(the car) on it** you have to follow laws and pay fees. If you begin to **use what you own(the car) on something you don't own (the road) without paying your share (taxes)**, then they take your car away because you broke the law society has created through representative elected officials.
If you have such a beef with taxes **BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE FUCKING ARGUING ABOUT, NOT OWNERSHIP**, then by all means buy a boat and live on international waters. Until then, get your head out of your ass.

Were you even around when bitcoins were in the $1-5 range? Because that was the only bitcoin was basically used for, drugs and gambling. If it wasn't for a dice site, it was for silk road.
When Silk Road closed, drugs wasn't the main thing for bitcoin anymore, but it was obviously big enough to cause a crash, gambling and basically day trading was bigger then.

My family has over a hundred(Former collection of my grandfather) , along with my father having an FFL class 3, so I've had some exposure to guns, even shot three handguns yesterday.
America is a paranoid bunch, but within the gun community there is what's called a "Fudd", like elmer fudd, it's people who like guns for sport(targets, competions, etc.) or hunting, not killing people or carrying as defense.

$1 - little more than a loaf of sliced bread
$10 - two large decent frozen pizzas
&lt;$40 - fill car's gas tank
$100 - two trips to red lobster
Everything is priced in everything else, it's just to reference worth. When a currency is the majority, it's priced in goods and services, when it's a minority or different than what someone is used to, it's used compared to other currencies. You can price BTC in

Pools work by giving out work for the miners, who then report back possible solutions to the pool, the pool checks and if it's correct, it relays it. Effectively, the entire pool was working for that block at the same time until one of them finds the right one. 
This may have been a quick find before any transactions... but I see nothing impressive here if it's from a pool.

You said "**impossible** to counterfeit"


Ebay uses the internet, that doesn't mean the stuff that is being traded around is on the internet too. All money services are basically transferring money by saying "OK, in the US, you now control $400 less, in Nigeria, you(or someone) now have $380 more" the fees are for "moving" your money there that to the business takes time to actually get the money over there(the physical money) that they need to keep there in supply, covering legal junk, exchange differences and general cost of running the business.
SWIFT's money isn't on the internet, you merely tell them what to do with your money through the internet. Bitcoin can go through some borders(that don't have some firewall) but that doesn't make it legal to do based on the local laws.


A guy at 129.132.188.103 in Germany, get a warrant for an ISP and you can narrow it down to probably 5 people. As for who is getting it, Some guy at 64.239.133.178 in LA, which you can do the same and get a warrant. It's only anonymous if you don't spend it, you spend it and you can easily see who.
If these aren't the correct people, governments can easily set up their own nodes to capture the transaction live and get true IPs of who made it.

A long complicated history of bonds, loans and forced taxes from the colonial days. When the state does a project (build a road), the fees and taxes normally work out to cover the cost of the road and normally not much more, if at all.


Yes. How is that vicious, it's how mass commerce is possible...


They don't take your money unless you you want to use the roads, which is done through  driver's licence fees. These taxes happen as a result of driving on the road, not before.


You don't pay those taxes unless you're using the road, It goes
I want to use the road ----&gt;  I pay driver's license fee and other fees (varies by state)---&gt; I can now use public roads with my car(which you own).
There is no pre-tax of this, none, please stop throwing it in there, it doesn't exist at federal, state or probably not even city level. like 99% of all taxes are from a result of something, like sales tax is not done before you do a sale, it happens after the sale. I didn't own a car until I was 21, I never had to pay a cent involving roads, still didn't until we registered the car for driving on public roads.
You entire basis is this pre-tax concept, I have no idea why cause I never said it existed, because it doesn't.

No, the state(really the public) own  most **roads**, because they built it and paid for it. In exchange for use of the road they built, they want payment for it's use(of the road, not your car), called taxes and licenses.
You always owned your car, but if you want to **use it(your car, which you own) on something you do not own**, like public roads, highways and freeways, you have to pay becuase you do not own those previous things.
If you own your car and own the road(because you built it on your land), You don't pay anything, you don't even need a license or pay to transfer ownership to use it, no one is going to take it away. It is seriously a simple concept, why is it confusing?

Ok, seriously, what is wrong with you?
the danger of Japan doesn't matter? The attitude of their military that attack the US first has no meaning?
WW2 wasn't fucking play time in a sandbox, where it doesn't matter who did what. It was a kill or be killed time in history between countries, Japan was out to kill people, they were out to take control of the world along with Germany. What do you think the US should have done? Sit on their hands an wait to be bombed by japanese planes?
I seriously don't think you even know the context of the bomb dropping in WW2. It was late in the war, Germany was on their way of of making their own atomic bomb to use in the war, the US's use of the bomb wasn't some dropping to kill the enemy(which it was directed in a military harbor), it was also a show of force as a "you can see what we can do, end your actions now or as the war progresses more will be dropped", it was a gun to the head so to speak to end the war, to show Germany that we'd beat them to making it, and effective a show of what the war would turn into if it didn't end(later would be used as a mutual assured destruction concept)
Ethically, should the US have dropped the bombs on japan? You can debate that for the coming centuries if you like. but the effect was clear, and to boil it down to "they bomb an island nation" is an insult to history of that day.

Lets say everyone leaves and we're left with 1/100 of the hash rate of the network. 
Now blocks take 100x longer to generate, or 600-800minutes on average.  It will also take at most 200 weeks for the difficulty to change and have things go back to normal.  So it would take at most 4 years for bitcoin to recover. It'd be a virtual depression as a few transactions would get confirmations.  
If literally everyone leaves mining, bitcoin ceases to function entirely.

Does he not own the road(public road)? THEN HE HAS TO FUCKING PAY FOR IT'S USE. BECAUSE IT'S NOT HIS ROAD.
Do I make you pay for the use of my stuff, hell ya. Why the hell would public roads be different? It isn't yours, you pay to use it.
**WHY IS THIS FUCKING COMPLICATED FOR YOU IDIOTS.** I ALSO NEVER SAID ANYTHING IS OK, I NEVER SAID IT SHOULD BE THIS WAY, I'M EXPLAINING WHAT IS AND ISN'T.
You want a damn real world example?
You go into a house THAT IS NOT YOURS. You live there for a few months, the owner WHO OWNS IT, wants payment for USE OF SOMETHING THAT ISN'T YOURS. Do you then say "WTF, Ransom!"
Do you charge people for using your stuff? EXACT SAME CONCEPT.

Not until they have some solution to accepting that they A) don't have to develop themselves and B) reliable and extremely low risk to accept. having a 50% drop in worth does not help merchants to want to accept them directly, the safe bet for them is to exchange them for USD at transaction.
But then you're really accepting bitcoins the same as McDonald's accepts gold or vintage hot wheels.

It makes a huge difference when it comes to the success of bitcoin, if all you're having businesses do is avoid bitcoin by instantly converting it... how does that improve bitcoin's economy? 
The business isn't going to give it the the supplier who gives it to the manufacturer, who gives it to the parts maker, etc.
Nope, just goes to  few  companies that only go and sell it on the exchange, zero economic improvement.

Then follow this 
since you don't have a copy of your wallet.dat or the private keys in them, those are basically gone, but any coins in the paper wallet(Note: that you created and never used even once and only sent coins to it) will be accessible once you import the private key into your client.

Probably the guy getting shot from the person who bought it illegally wants to shoot.
If it wasn't meant to harm anyone, the buyer would get it legally, and probably cheaper too. No one buys an illegal gun for target shooting.

Becuase you used it, bitcoin makes change address when you make a transaction, it's not shown to you 
If you use a wallet, your backup no longer holds all your bitcoins.(it at least holds some, if you happen to lose your non-backup wallet) You can receive bitcoins to a wallet without issue, your backup with still be valid, but ig you **spend any** your backup is invalid and only holds a fraction of your current wallet, so back up after every transaction.

You don't even know the fee amount for bitcoin! Do you even know how bitcoin works, or did you just come from the "GRR I HATE PAYPAL" wave? That almost every transaction needs a fee to have it completed in a decent time. That like 99.9% of all transactions by other currencies are free of any fee ingoring taxes.
@_date: 2013-03-15 04:59:42
No, saying that students asking about bitcoin is becuase they're "hungry for new ideas because they know there is something wrong with the current economic system of inflationary money." is an extreme view
I'm in this thread cause I hoped that maybe, just maybe, we'd talk about what they asked, what they knew, instead I get fucking politics.

They put up some games, you pay whatever you want and determine how the money is split up(HB, Devs, Charity). Pay $1+ and you get Steam keys for those games, normally there is a "pay more than average and get these too" bonus games for paying about the average of all purchases.

My point was that they sell so few bundles with bitcoins, that the fees from credit cards would outnumber it.

Can you prove that in any way shape or form? No? So why do you jump to the conclusion that it's true. Futher, why would they even care if someone closed thier account at dwolla? The basically no-name payment service that no one really uses.


You know that the US government has basically done nothing involving bitcoin, they've made a comment here and there(which have been mostly positive), but that is it.
