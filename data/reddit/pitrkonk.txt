Actually it was $800 and this isn't sub. This is just post.

Just bought my first 0.13 BTC. I'm not "virgin" anymore! :)

Hey guys.
My first and very basic question on r/Bitcoin. I wanna buy. I don't really understand from this discussion if I should or not. What is your opinion? What is your expectation for Q4 of 2018?
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:49:10
That's not the point. Point is: Just hold it and don't panic. And don't ask stupid questions like "AAAAAAAAH.. What is going oooon!?"
Update: Yes it is entertaining for me.

Actually. Make sense. :)

I did not buy any Bitcoin yet but I just saw the chart.. I knew I have to come here to see the panic and have fun... What a shame I don't have any popcorn with me.

So I misunderstood. No irony. Then thank you man! :)
@_date: 2018-09-07 12:16:54
Do I feel the irony? U don't have to pray. I plan to hold you know... And besides, if you want to pray, at least include the reason based on some facts why so.

I remember some individuals writing on r/Bitcoin few months ago sentences like "I look forward to times all of us will going to be rich!" and similar motivational shit. I have commented that I'm curious how would they react when massive dumps starts to happen. Now I wonder... :D
