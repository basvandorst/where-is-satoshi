What if it gets approved?

I need to put something like this on my Razor scooter.

Loved it.  Certified Fresh.

Nah you’re a cool bot, have an upvote 
@_date: 2018-08-25 00:22:06
Yeah it is.  In a few years, it will be basically like owning a small house in cash
@_date: 2018-08-05 03:57:35
BTC making dreams come true out here.

“This cryptocurrency hype man once opened up his speech with the infamous line Wasawasawasasa Bitconneeeeeeeeect”

That looks like a great time.  I bet the guy who got his neck broken in the mosh pit is enjoying his liquid breakfast this morning.  
@_date: 2018-10-14 21:42:42
LOL exactly
@_date: 2019-03-02 22:38:28
Your point is that you can break your neck in a million different ways, so you might as well just throw caution to the wind.  Brilliant!

Vitalik would embarrass this dude badly.  I was going to say he would eat him alive but that wouldn’t fit well here ;)

Except the economy is coming back to life under Trump.

It’s so much of a game changer that Bitcoin mooned from $6465 to $6468 in less than a week.
@_date: 2018-10-27 17:58:02
This guy leverages.
@_date: 2019-02-01 06:19:27
Do not do this 
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:22:09
In 5 years I think it will be between $50k-$150k
@_date: 2018-11-13 01:18:40
It’s gonna be May

Coinbase Pro
@_date: 2018-11-09 22:39:17
8% ain’t going to do it fellas.
@_date: 2019-01-20 21:17:39
Let’s start by getting through $6000
@_date: 2019-01-17 00:06:53
Tough to pick just one, but I think the best 3 are Bitcoin, Nano, and Monero
@_date: 2018-11-12 04:41:50
Why would that matter?  
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:19:46
Red would be nice if I weren’t already all in with every dollar I have access to.
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:01:41
Bro you should’ve started by telling me to put on my tinfoil hat.  Now all these aliens out here trying to get at my brain.
@_date: 2019-01-17 04:32:28
Sort of curious how many comments about Nano have been deleted from this post by the mods

Many people lost everything because they were trading on margin.  
@_date: 2018-07-08 22:39:11
Ah the old Tulip mania nonsense.  One of the most exaggerated and inaccurate stories in the history of planet Earth.
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:08:52
your self has not been wrecked, I just checked
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:41:20
This begs the question, why doesn’t Dad own any Bitcoin yet? :)

Let’s be real, if he bought that Nissan Versa with Bitcoin profits, he’s doing a lot better than me
@_date: 2018-07-03 00:15:13
If you tell me one more time that you did this for your family...

I thought that was a nuclear mushroom cloud coming up at first instead of a tree.  Seems more fitting actually.
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:54:16
I think we will trade in the $2000-$6000 range for a while until we get closer to the May 2020 halving, which will cause anywhere from a 3x-10x explosion in value around that time.  
@_date: 2018-12-27 15:59:08
@_date: 2018-12-13 13:29:59
That’s only 10 days.

Market cycles.  People asked your same question the last 4 times Bitcoin crashed 80%+
@_date: 2018-12-16 12:45:10
Why stop there at $10 and not just go to zero and then -$1,000,000?  
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:25:13
Shorts are definitely not at ATH
