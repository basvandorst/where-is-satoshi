"The average person neither wants nor can control private keys [and therefore] we need to stop saying that you don't own bitcoin if you don't control the private keys." This does not follow. Presuming that we want the average person to own bitcoins, the focus should be on creating a desire and making it possible for them to control private keys. The meaning of "own bitcoin" does not depend on what the average person is able to do!

The expected return on solo mining is still the same as for pooled mining. If that isn't intuitive, think about what the relationship is between a miner and a pool. Effectively, the pool pays the miner to solo mine for the pool. If the expected return from solo mining became disproportionately smaller as the difficulty increased, then the pool would end up receiving less than it paid out.

I think altcoins are getting their value from their collectibility, just like Bitcoins. I might even argue that precious metals and fiat currency get their value in much the same way (see Nick Szabo's paper at 
Sidechains would likely reduce the demand for altcoins, depressing their value, but the property of collectibility is intrinsic to the altcoins themselves, so the most marketed or funny altcoins would retain a non-zero reservation price. They'll still be worth *something* - just maybe not very much.
(Off-topic, but: Nick Szabo's analysis of the role of collectibility in creating money was almost certainly necessary for the invention of Bitcoin. See his [response to gwern]( on why Bitcoin was not invented sooner than it was.)

Ok - you know the Bitcoin mixing services, where you put some bitcoins in and get random other coins out a bit later? Imagine that one of them is evil, and records who deposited and withdrew each bitcoin. Poof, anonymity is gone.
So I decide to make a completely new type of Bitcoin mixer, that *can't* track my users in this way. How? That's where the maths comes in. Users still send transactions in the normal way, but we don't keep any kind of user account anymore. Now, when they want to withdraw, they send me a proof that they transferred some bitcoins to me, and that the transaction hasn't yet been redeemed. What's special about this proof is that it doesn't tell me anything about which bitcoins were sent. All I know is that the person requesting bitcoins has sent me at least that many, and that I haven't paid out on those bitcoins yet, whichever they are.
Now I just send bitcoins to whatever address the user specifies, and add the proof to my records. I can never link any particular deposit and withdrawal, and it's easy to prove this to my users. Everyone starts using my mixer and I get rich quick.
With me so far? Here's the kicker. What I'm doing *doesn't require any secret information*. I can publish every computation I make on the open Internet, and no-one can use that to trace transactions. They learn that a mixer was used by certain addresses, but that's it.
Now, because no secret information is required, anyone can verify that I'm running my mixer properly. But this means that my service can now be decentralized. Just take the computations I'm running and make them part of the Bitcoin protocol. Now anyone can use special transactions to 'deposit' bitcoins - with no-one in particular - and 'withdraw' them to different addresses.
That is what this stuff is about - anonymity built right into the blockchain, provably unbreakable and impossible to undermine.
However, there's a catch. The way we know how to do this right now uses ZK SNARK maths. When you use that, you have to do some set-up, using a secret. If you know the secret, you can pretend to have as many coins as you want. You only ever need to use the secret once, but no-one can ever know what it is. That means that whoever starts the decentralized mixer has to be honest. But the returns on being dishonest are staggering - it's free money, whenever you want it, and no-one can tell you're doing it. Imagine a magic portal that spits out gold bars and you've got the idea.
How do you solve this problem? By making it very hard to cheat, and picking people who we all believe would never cheat. Researchers are a pretty good bet, because if they were motivated by money they'd be doing something else :)
How don't you solve this problem? By trusting anonymous guys whose leaked Skype conversations show them up as amateurish criminals.
Oh, and did I mention how freaking hard it is to program all this? It's really hard. There's a very high competency barrier, so high that when someone says they're over it, it's a good idea to see some proof before you start believing them.

Would you favour, in principle, merging strong anonymity technology? Assume 'moon-math' issues are resolved, to the extent that whatever is used is as well understood as Bitcoin's existing crypto. And to be clear, by 'strong anonymity' I mean anonymity relying on the inherent nature of the protocol, and so on no form of ongoing reputation monitoring.

Using a DHT provides some but not all of the functionality needed for applications like counterparty.
The way it would work would be with OP_RETURN outputs containing a protocol ID and a hash. To make a transaction you form it, commit to it with an OP_RETURN of its hash, then insert it into the DHT. Then the DHT nodes can stop spam or false transactions by only accepting valid transactions that have a hash reference on the blockchain.
That means that you can be assured that all transactions you see are actually made by whoever controls the associated bitoin addresses. The problem is that a transaction's validity potentially depends on every single prior transaction - so the DHT has to be kept up to date with every single transaction.
Now supposing that you just check that every OP_RETURN with a Counterparty identifier has a transaction in the DHT. If you see every transaction, you know that you're up to date and can validate new transactions. The problem comes when someone starts making OP_RETURNs but withholding the inserts from the DHT. The whole consensus process grinds to a halt, because the hash might, but is not guaranteed to, refer to a valid transaction and so invalidate any later transaction. This is a real problem, because if you just carry on as normal, it becomes possible to do a network-splitting attack, and without a PoW mechanism there's no obvious way of resolving it.
What I hope is that there's a non-obvious way of solving it, but I don't know of any that don't involve other suboptimal solutions like merge-mining.

There's definitely a subtlety here - Seth will be +$1000 if Bitcoin hits $2000 before it hits $200 - but consider the following: Kane can hedge away all his risk and lock in a guaranteed profit. That extra value can't come from nowhere - it has to come from Seth. So there has to be some sense in which Seth has just cost himself money.
And there is. Seth has just adopted what is known as a [strictly dominated strategy]( The bet he's made ends when either 1 Bitcoin &lt; $200, or 1 Bitcoin &gt; $2000. If he had simply bought one Bitcoin for 450$, and exchanged it for dollars at the end, he would have lost $250 if Bitcoin hit $200, and gained $1550 if Bitcoin hit $2000, rather than losing $1000 / gaining $1000. His position would have been better in both outcomes. Seth's loss is partly masked by him increasing the risk exposure of his position, but he could have done so more cheaply just by buying Bitcoin. It's like he paid 60 cents to flip for a dollar.

Currently my Bitcoin transactions are easier to monitor than my cash transactions. I don't like that. My total balance is relatively easy to calculate. I don't like that at all. At any point from now to the historical future event horizon some marketroid will be able to do these things and create a full profile of my actions up to this moment in time. That is completely unacceptable. 
If moon-math zero knowledge Bitcoin solves these problems, I'll start using it. So will anyone who truly cares about these things. I will publicly advocate for private transactions to be standardized. I will make a habit of politely pointing out to people whenever they expose something they probably didn't want to by using pay-to-pubkey-hash - which will be all the damn time. I will make it my business to convince the world that private balances and transactions are the natural order of things, with public transactions intended only for the purpose of making a transaction public. I will do this until all I hear is "but zerocash has higher transaction costs!". And then I will have won, because people hate trading off their fundamental values for money, and the right to privacy is fundamental.

It's not a Finney attack as such, though. Bitundo just makes best-effort to make a block that double-spends the transaction. There's insufficient evidence in any specific case that the original transaction wasn't just a terrible mistake. It won't do a genuine Finney attack by mining a block and withholding it while you make a transaction which you both know to be born a double-spend. That really would be a conspiracy to defraud, prima facie.

The 'zk snark' bit is a reference to the mathematical technology behind Zerocoin/Zerocash. In this context it's a clear indicator that these guys are trying to bullshit each other as well as their supposed marks, because a) the zero-knowledge SNARK tech is very hard to implement from scratch, as claimed - you need graduate level mathematics or compsci to do it properly, and b) proposed implementations of Zerocoin using SNARKs need a 'signing ceremony', where a random key is generated, used once to initialize the currency, and then destroyed. If the key is kept, it can be used to generate unlimited currency in an untraceable way! Thus, the key has to be generated by trusted individuals in a publicly verifiable way - think presence of independent monitors, video records of the procedure, chain of custody on all hardware and software used, and physically destroying the computer used for initialization. So if what '00smurf' was claiming here is true, it would be much, much worse than if ve was just pretending to have a real implementation.

I just read the VerSum paper. The idea of using interval bisection to find the point at which a dishonest computer starts lying is cool; the implementation as discussed has some obvious flaws:
1. DOSable. By design, the VerSum servers can be induced to construct 600KB proofs in response to ~hundred byte requests.
2. Excessive storage requirements. Storing the UTXO proofs takes 365GB; how large will the proofs of Ethereum contracts be? Therefore only a few servers will ever run VerSum verification; thus the protocol will be even more vulnerable to a DOS.
3. Inherently weak security guarantee. The protocol requires, at the point in time at which the lightweight client wishes to make a transaction, that at least one honest server exists. If this condition fails to pertain, *then the client can be convinced that a false computation is true*. Thus a successful DOS of all honest servers allows outright theft.
Edit: In one sense, the security guarantee is the best available: one honest server is the minimum you can have while still learning something. But it's still inadequate: the client should never, ever believe something to be true when it is false. In other words, the protocol optimises for the wrong thing.

Thanks for replying, first of all.
The order of transactions does become known eventually, once they enter blocks that are mined on top of. Zero-confirmation becomes too risky to use, but the ordering of transactions with multiple confirmations is reliable enough for most purposes.
Are you just talking about inserting bond sales data for the purpose of having a known timestamped datastream? DHT + timestamped hash works fine for that. What these layered semantic protocols are trying to add are transactions with a commonly agreed upon meaning, like 'accept a bet offer on this datastream', thus eliminating the counterparty risk. What I'm saying is that it doesn't look very easy to have an 'actionable' meaning on transactions whose data lives off-blockchain, whereas it's actually been implemented at least twice with on-chain data.

As I understand Tor to work, you don't switch relays all that often, so the number of payment channels to be established shouldn't be that high.

Unless you're talking about the ancient history of Electrum your 1. is not applicable, because the client still requires an SPV. You can DOS a lot of things (including Bitcoin nodes), point is that this should not be a catastrophic event. That is what an SPV protects you from. As to blockchain explorers, well...
Re 2. storage space, that is fair. Time-space tradeoff, very good (on second reading, VerSum caches computations at ~~transaction boundaries~~ some level of detail, subject to developer tweaking). Nevertheless, it is far from free either in time or space to initialise a new server, which is important in the following.
"The odds of one honest server existing" is not the correct security metric. I can run one server behind 1000 proxies and run a Sybil attack - each client has a limited number of connections, so will have high probability of just connecting to me. If not, a DOS will just look like a couple of servers dropping offline. This is not unusual.
If I successfully capture a client's connections, it's as if I have a time machine. I can't sign transactions on anyone else's behalf, but I can sign or not sign transactions of my own, and I can remove others' transactions as if they never happened. One attack here is buying Bitcoin with XCP that doesn't live at the address the client thinks it does. I (really) own some XCP at an address A. Then I (really) transfer it to address B. Now I lie to the client by proving the existence of XCP at A, but ignoring my transaction from A to B. I also insert a spurious order to buy Bitcoin for XCP. Perhaps I match an order that the client already placed. The client sends a BTCPay (i.e. signs a valid and high-value Bitcoin transaction to A) and is now screwed, because neither my order nor its BTCPay messages are valid in the real Counterparty consensus, but the Bitcoin transaction certainly is in the Bitcoin consensus.

Yeah, it's a denial of service. It does not and cannot enable anyone to lie to you about the blockchain from that point onward without employing huge quantities of hashpower. As far as I can tell, this is not a claim that VerSum can make.


is a fact about the Counterparty consensus, in other words what the network of full verifiers believes. What I'm saying is that I can insert that invalid order (which neither Bitcoin miners nor the Bitcoin protocol will prevent me from doing) and claim to a lightweight client that it's valid by showing a proof that skips an intermediate transaction. The client, or rather the owner of the client, will then do something inadvisable. Timed auctions with late settlement sound like a good idea to me, that should create more opportunities to verify properly that everything is kosher.
Edit: And I accept your point about most Counterparty transactions not having an effect unless based on valid assumptions. That's why I picked BTCPay, it sticks out like that.
Edit2: Further, on reflection, being DOSable is not something that is specific to VerSum and not to Electrum etc, so strike my original point 1. I still have a bad feeling about the amount of work a crafted message could cause a VerSum to perform, but in practice that sort of thing can usually be patched.

Technically very little luck is involved. The miner could simply not broadcast their block-filling transactions. The only risk would be if their block was broadcast, then orphaned, with the winning chain containing the block-fillers (normally transactions in orphaned blocks go back to a node's mempool). However the orphan rate is low enough that this is not a significant expense for a miner.
If this is happening it should be fairly easy to detect: if high-fee transactions are rarely seen in the mempool as unconfirmed transactions, but frequently in blocks, that would be probative.

If I'd fucked the firmware up, and for some reason didn't want to send the hardware on time and put the patch up when available, I'd probably pay compensation per diem, with "electricity" costs deducted, rather than up to seven working days after delivery, and would likely not have the gall to charge a "pool" fee to someone who has made no commitment to join any mining pool, but that's just me.

According to your team, this proposal is incompatible with BIP141. As BIP9 signalling permits activation of multiple proposals by default, your proposal should either
1. explicitly state itself to have no effect in the event that BIP141 activates first, or
2. have a BIP9 starttime which does not overlap with that of BIP141.
