Of course not. The other guys will surely prove to be more secure, transparent, scalable, have a nicer CSS and be all around better than Mt. Gox. Trust my word guys. It's in their best interest. Exchanges won't fuck up from now on. Because of the Free Market and stuff.

But Bitcoin is totally solid and not dead guys! Just don't invest in it if you aren't rich because people regularly lose all the money they put in it overnight!

Is there a reason other than "Bitcoin exchanges get hacked in a weekly basis"?

Like, seriously. Spartan society was as brutal as it was ineffective. 
The elites were just devoted to maintaining their tight grip on their far larger slave populations, had a low birth rate, and you can barely name a single scientific advancement, technological innovation, or cultural work coming from them.
They took a bullet once for the Greek city-states that sucked less, and for that, and being a pain in the ass to them for a while, they are remembered.

And furthermore, the gains are only from the expectation that other people will want to buy your satoshis in the near future.
That's it. There's nothing else. When you actually invest in shares from a company, you are giving money to people who will work with it and make things that people want, or provide a service that people find valuable. Actual stuff happens with the money and some type of wealth is created.
With bitcoin? No such things. Only pyramid scheme-like speculation and manipulation from actors like Bitfinex drive its price, and the transaction times, fees and volatility make it useless as a currency.

That value wasn't worth 6000 USD per BTC much less 20000 USD, as you are seeing right now.

Enough said, really. As a parting piece of advise, try to diversify by investing into online poker.

What? Optimistic reports say that it takes  78 minutes to clear a transaction, and 15-30 USD to perform them.
That's pretty shitty for a new technology poised to replace bank transfers.
Much more so if it's tied to an asset that's volatile as fuck in real-life-money.

The promise of money multiplying itself for no discernible reason?

Maybe they value customer loyalty, and find that they would lose it if they just had the offer and demand curves meet.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:29:33
Fine, thank you.
Bitcoin could be useful in the way you say, were its transactions fast, fees low, and if it lost all the value it has accrued as a Ponzi scheme.

Not now. Really, not now. It would actually be helpful if you deleted your post.

Yes, but that only makes it a store that can't handle hundreds of people buying eggs, with the consequences of this crash, you are making it sound as though MtGox has some moral responsibility here =/

The board exists partly to contain them; the administration hates them, and m00t, the guy running the site, actually shut them down once already because he hated the idea of hosting a neo-nazi gathering place, but... if they shut it down, they'll start fucking up the rest of the site, so it remains.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:12:43
If you aren't joking, he was implying that you came from a board in 4chan populated by far-right, white supremacist types.

What? People panicked because the bubble finally burst, and they had to cash-in quickly to profit, or cut their losses. MtGox just did what they could. If you go to your nearby store, and the lines are too long, is it the fault of the store?

I think there are some important other possibilities omitted there (hint: how many detractors were in it for the money, realistically?)
