It's probably related to linode being down. A ton of linode VPSes went down today for network maintenance. Some of them are back up already.

The bitcoin RPC server is part of [bitcoind]( the bitcoin daemon. The GUI bitcoin client afaik does not support the RPC server. You can read more about the config file [here](

Looks like a bitcoin client for iOS. Not sure though...

[The btc-e chat is insanely active right now. People are spamming their addresses in hopes the attacker will give out some of the bticoins he stole. "MrWubbles", supposedly the attacker, is actually giving out free coins it seems.](

Where are the keys stored? Why does this even matter if the download link sends you the decrypted version?

The scary part is these guys are just a letter off mtgox. Someone new to bitcoins could easily fall for it. (They also own mtgax and a few more, afaik)

[Here's a post from a while ago about starting a bitcoin web service.]( It's insane how these sites can have such idiotic vulnerabilities.

They do use linode:
    224.255.173.in-addr.arpa	nameserver = ns5.linode.com.
    224.255.173.in-addr.arpa	nameserver = ns2.linode.com.
    224.255.173.in-addr.arpa	nameserver = ns3.linode.com.
    224.255.173.in-addr.arpa	nameserver = ns4.linode.com.
    224.255.173.in-addr.arpa	nameserver = ns1.linode.com.

Selling them at btc-e right now would be *really* risky. If btc-e is compromised (and all signs point to yes right now) then chances are you'll lose your bitcoins. No one is going to pay 99USD (current price) for your bitcoins.

You have to add a user, password, and a host in your conf file before being able to run bitcoind. (it shows that in the article I posted)
@_date: 2012-08-31 21:59:10
Where do you suggest they store the bitcoins then? On a harddrive sitting in their closet?
@_date: 2012-09-21 19:11:09
Bitcoins that are stored in a wallet not connected to the internet.

You'll never find anonymous registration for domains. ICANN requires some form of contact to always be on file, even if the whois is private.

I once met a Christian woman who likened RFID to "the mark of the beast" and that magstripes on credit cards are tools used by the devil to control people.

Please invest in some type of pen testing or security audit. A bitcoin exchange with security in the same state as yours is pretty disappointing. As it stands right now, I can change the password of any user account just by knowing their username/email.

Tell me again /why/ anyone would want to be the paypal of bitcoin? Don't even get me started on the poor descriptions and shoddy video...

If the key is hidden in the download URL, then the key is accessible to anyone with the URL (anyone) and anyone with server access (eg law enforcement). And likely, the access logs as well.
Only reason I ask is because I've seen many implementations of "AES-256 encrypted file uploads" but each time, the key is stored on disk on the same server. Most literally, this achieves nothing.
