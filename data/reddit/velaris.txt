I don't mind if it's not a "daily-life" kind of currency. I also don't need it to be used worldwide and to kill Fiat. I just want it to have a purpose that doesn't entail just making a quick buck. That's what's lacking right now - a widely accepted purpose that fills a void and provides advantages that cannot be denied by the average Joe.
As it is, it's just a very cool thing useful in an utopian world and backed with an impressive technology.

I bought a few hundred dollars worth of bitcoin and I'm holding. I'm not panicking because I couldn't care less if I lose everything - I invested what I can afford to lose.
With that said, I don't see this currency going  anywhere if I can't freaking use it in stores. I want to buy my grocery with Bitcoin. Pay for car repairs with Bitcoin. Pay my mortgage with Bitcoin. Etc.
Can it stop being a quick way to make (or lose) money and start being an actual currency ?

Just got done watching this video and I’m much more educated on the technology behind bitcoin and the currency itself. Please share more videos like these, either through PM or here :)

Thanks for the info. I  tried QuadrigaCX before - They didn't freeze my funds but I had to wait 2-3 days for the funds to clear... Still annoying, but better than nothing :)
I wish we had more options here in Canada...

Why would they put a sell order at 9k ? I don’t understand why they wouldn’t want it to surpass 9k.
Total newbie here, still learning how this whole system works :)
Are we talking about pump and dump ?

Good to know, thanks. I’m in Quebec unfortunately.

Well I'm pissed off. RBC Visa in Canada banned Coinbase it seems. They flagged the website as a "gambling" site and as such refuses to allow transactions with them.
It feels GREAT knowing that I can't use my money the way I want to, whenever I want to, with whoever I want to. Nice !
