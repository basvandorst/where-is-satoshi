You're wasting your time. I have a thread right now where people are trying to convince me that Bitcoin.org is a good website that serves it's purpose. Apparently everything in Bitcoin is magically absolutely perfect on the first try and there's no point even exercising any contrarian thoughts.

The purpose of a high ranking website is not information (wikipedia and official documentation serve that purpose just fine), it's CONVERSION. Somebody that hears "Bitcoin" on TV for the n-th time and decides to google it, wants to become a user not a researcher. 
And I don't buy that it shouldn't be consumer facing product, just a "protocol" for some centralized institutions like Circle or coinbase. That's not the original spirit of this project.

Are you saying there are people for whom "Bitcoin" search term doesn't return bitcoin.org as the first result?
@_date: 2014-12-30 15:22:59
These are well recognized usage patterns, not assumptions. People click on the first result. Your individual customs don't change that.

Why is it not ready? I don't get it.

This is another way of saying that the system was dysfunctional to begin with.

Bitreserve is a service. Try BitUSD, BitGOLD etc. on the Bitshares blockchain.

Bitreserve is a centralized service. You give them your BTC and they promise to hold GOLD for you. They're not an insured bank but have to spy on you nonetheless. It's like sending your money to some website.
BitAssets on the other hand reside on a decentralized blockchain and don't require trust. 
 is a pretty good introduction.

You can check out CCEDK's card: 
They're running a promotion where there's no monthly fee for the first 10k users. 
If I'm not mistaken, you can spend Bitcoin directly from your trading account without needing to top up the card.

What is needed is a price-stable cryptocurrency. This can be constructed as a fungible smart contract for a variable amount of Bitcoin.  
Unfortunately, Bitcoin developers are too busy arguing unimportant tweaks for their archaic chain, so it had to be done on Bitshares.

So no euphoric at all? $100 is what,  six coffee drinks? That's like two to three days worth of consumption.

My gut guess would be that the same capital owns T-mobile Poland and InPay and they are trying to boost that startup before the next funding round. The 20% just screams "Look at us! Look how much money InPay can save for businesses!"

The problem with online poker was that it got really big out of the blue and so it's non-politically-connected capital. They need to be squashed and bought out by the old money.
