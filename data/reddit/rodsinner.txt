You are mixing hierarchic authority with cohersive authority. Your boss can't rob you, kidnap you or kill you. Your dad neither. The state, rather you accept this or not, can and will. You choose to subject yourself to boss and daddy. Refuse to abide to the state contract you never signed into, and you already know what happens.
Hierarchy is morally based (it is consensual respect, a choice), while cohersion is the law of the jungle: You abide because their guns are bigger (that is, if they didn't disarm you already).
I could also go all day talking about Natural Law and Natural Rights, praxeology, etc, etc to put down this "that's why laws constantly change" utopia, but we barely have patience enough to talk about the current subject.
And you are right: most people will not buy into this anarchocapitalist crap. But those of us that do, leave us alone to form our own communities in our own land. If we ever use a state-service, send us the bill.

This is **not** for everyone:
I've been 100% running on bitcoin since August 2015. No regular bank accounts. Clients paid me in bitcoin directly and all USD from Paypal is converted whenever it touches the mean-line of the graph. Also paid my employee in bitcoin.
Ask me if I regret it. If you understand how fiat works, and how bitcoin works, **and your business model allows you to**, it's not a hard choice. Brazil has many solutions for crypto spending and gov theft evasion is really easy to pull off here. Dunno about other places, though.

What a waste if it really is for a UBI experiment. Donating to those who need is not the same thing as UBI. UBI is institutionalized slavery just like any other tax-supported activity.

Why would you buy your phone today if 10 years from now it will be much better for even less money? Maybe because you need and want a phone now, and not having one for 10 years (which are actually indefinite since in 10 more years it will be even better) would be the real loss.
I got exactly what I wanted. Billions of USD are worthless in the desert where you can't have what you need. My BTC would be worthless if I couldn't get what I want with them when I needed it. 
What about your salary being inflated away? You have to work a bit harder every year to get the same stuff. Or you're gonna tell me anyone can still easily buy a house in full payment today as people did 100 years ago? What about your 19 cents BigMac from 1972?

Your freedom has not increased via state by any means. In fact it is the opposite.
All the freedom you are referring to came from tech acquired via market. Your car, internet, phone camera, infinite types of food you eat, the medicine you shoot.
You are far less entitled to your property today than 1000 years ago. You pay easily 8 times more taxes today than just 400 years ago. Wars were localized and small, done by mostly private armies between monarchs. Today it's compulsory globally and wars have never been so enormous (WWI and II killed more than all previous wars combined). In most places you can't decide what your children learn, and state curriculum is mandatory. Central banking needs no comment.
Crime has never been as high as today. Weapons have never been so hard to acquire as today. Govs never had as much surveilance as today. "Intellectual Property" (which by definition can't be property at all), only halts innovation (Wright brothers spent the next 35 years suing instead of developing, after filing their patents for flight, meanwhile open-source tech flourishes ever more rapidly).
Yes, in old times you could catch a flu and die. But at least when you were a slave, you knew it and it was explicit to everyone else.
Get your facts straight.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:12:34
Maybe it will be easier to express what you mean if you simply say you don't want your property to be sistematically violated/taken by force. "Anarchy" (just like "Liberalism" or "Capitalism") is so distorted and far from core meaning it is useless to express anything precisely.

As far as I see, deflationary economy is a natural and sane economy, because what drives deflation is the technological advancement of productivity, reason why your phone although costing about the same amount of USD generation-after-generation, doubles in performance periodically.
It also leads to more rational spending. You consume what you need and can actually afford. I live comfortably solely on crypto since August 2015, knowing the price would rise. But that's me.

The daily purchase cap. They judge you're a bad guy upfront (due to regulation, I know, but it's still a ridiculously low cap).
Many clients of mine give up using bitcoin for the first time because of that. I understand a low cap for unverified users, but even after they know everything about you, you can't buy the coins you want? C'mon.

There's no due process to have your private property "taken" without consent. It is theft.

"The survey included 564 Americans that invested in Bitcoin. That's a tiny sample, and therefore, the survey findings should be interpreted with extreme caution."

Anarchocapitalism is more about freeing oneself from the state, rather than "taking over" it. And this will probably be an extreme "ever chased but never reached", just like communism, but it is the only ethic extreme to look up for. Bitcoin is aimed towards that.
In the last 200 years, we've seen the biggest, deadliest and bloodiest wars, which were total wars (compared to private armies fighting for aristocrats in the previous centuries).
In the past people would riot/behead/dethrone a monarch whenever taxation neared 10%. Rarely it ever crossed 20% before the French Rev. Now with our "beloved" democracy, you have compulsory military service, actual tax rate oftenly crossing 70% (VAT + IT + Inflation), relative property subject to "public interest", regulations for everything, and an ever-increasing surveilance state (NSA, CCTV, etc).
While hollywood-inspired "anarchy" is easy to debunk, actual anarchy is contractual governance based on legitimate private property. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:08:11
Please don't think I'm arguing with you or anything, just laying down my arguments. We all want to gather more knowledge, so let me know what you think :D
Yes, pre-democratic civilizations were mostly composed of peasants (slaves were only in significant numbers in non-european territories). They, however limited by their current tech and market complexity, did have far more rights to private property than you and I have today.
Private Property depends on mutual recognition of the community surrounding it, but to a certain extent. You can easily understand this principal looking at your own self-property: I can't claim possession over you, because you are the one in direct control of it. That happens so even if we established a contract of "voluntary servitude". You'd still be able to decide not to abide to such contract, and fulfilling such contract would still require your voluntary cooperation at all times.
If I take your shoes off right now, unless people around us acknowledged before hand that pair of shoes belonged to you somehow, there's no way of reclaiming anything pacifically, no matter if there is or not a state legitimizing property. At the root of the argument, you'll defend what is legitimately yours the same way you'll defend yourself from harm, and that's what ultimately legitimizes property: the capability to defend it from being taken (reason why protecting your private keys make your bitcoin yours, not the government. Leave your keys unprotected, and upon loss, no gov. will save you). You can bet people will respect your lands way more if you have a big toy to shoot them off if they step in uninvited.
So now that we defined property, we can establish that the idea of a state ultimately is the trade-off of property-rights vs. safety, although such safety is merely ilusory and only really benefits the state-ruler (the more totalitarian the government, higher the crime-rate).
About "the poor": It is very, very hard to be poor when there's nothing prohibiting you from creating wealth. But assuming you are unable to serve others via the market, we have plenty of "freemium" services today. I mean, throughout all history, the Catholic Church pretty much took care of everything "public" (schools, hospitals, universities, etc) for free, voluntarily. Today you browse Reddit for free, because there are people willing to keep the site running. Google is free, and they still get money out of it. Khan Academy is the world's largest school and it is free and voluntary. All public services you see today without a private voluntary solution, only exists this way because the state directly forbids it (and you know how govs crack down on bitcoin). Private voluntary institutions compete with eachother. Govs throw their solution down your throat with an arbitrary price-tag via taxation, rather you like it or not.
Anyway, I hope it was enlightening. Let me know if you agree or disagree.
