The point is that it's way more complicated to make a stabilized decentralized system for everyone's benefit. 99,99999% of the global monetary system still works with centralized money within private banking systems build by business corporations like IBM, Dell, AT&amp;T and others. I'm not saying the companies are not developing their own "blockchain" mainly for profit and control, but general public must wait a bit longer for decentralized solution because we are still using their infrastructure. You and I still earn monthly paycheck in Euros. I use internet banking system which is located on their servers which are connected to the ATMs with  permission from a chip located in my debit card. To change this, you and I will have to earn money in bitcoins using market thousands times bigger than around 9,7bn Dollars.
Edit: And another part of Price's speech was that China control's Bitcoin using their Miners, so in the end it's (not only) about participation.

So you basically bought bitcoins using centralized currency earlier when bitcoin were cheaper and then sold it or in later stages with big budget That's great for you, I envy you. Unfortunately not everyone is in same situation like you with big budget or other means to be able to use entirely different monetary system and this is the problem, it takes time.
