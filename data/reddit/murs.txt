Youre ignorant

In a technical sense yes, in a practical sense no. It's far far away from being widely adopted as a currency. It's already widely adopted as a commodity. Its currency in the same sense that gold is a currency. That's my only point. Unless you wanna argue semantics calling it a bona fide currency is disingenuine and blatant wishful thinking.

It's barely a currency. It's like commodities trading at this point in time.

I see no picture in the article

It's not man get over it. 99.99999% of goods and services can't be purchased with bitcoin right now. You can use bottles of water as payment more places than you can use bitcoin. Like a lot of other bitcoin supporters youre using wishful thinking and getting ahead of yourself. It's a niche form of payment, not a currency.

The reason the price is so high is because it's trading like a commodity and people are trying to make as much money as they can from it before it crashes. Not that it won't ever be a type of currency but a lot is going to happen between now and then

Sorry but realistically that's not the case yet.

Just wants to up the price of bitcoin and profit from it....

He just wants to drive up the price of bitcoin and make some money. No different than someone pushing a penny stock.

Did I just watch the whole Lord of the Rings movie?

Lol a 16 year old posting on r/bitcoin considering what everyone says about this board this doesn't exactly help this places public image very much lol
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:08:54
How young we talking here? Lord of the Rings isn't even that old wtf? I don't even wanna be conversating with someone that young tbh how can I mark this person?

I've never actually seen them. How can someone never even have heard of it though? Just through being alive by osmosis? Didn't have to watch the movies to know where this scene came from. Is Lord of the Rings not a thing amongst young people anymore? Is it all about Game of Thrones? 
But 16 years Jesus Christ. Time flies.
