600 a year so 50 bucks a month , wow.. this is if you have a shitty job and dont aspire to do anything with your life.
Ive got no education at all, and i had a six figure salary working in sales, based on my results ive now landed 70k a year of secure income, with bonuses, great insurance, cheap loans, etc..
My first year of working full time was 2016, i earned 20k. I havent gotten 1 fucking cent from anyone. You guys complaining about this i shit is pathetic, start working stop complaining.

While "rude" they are true, and not ignorant, most people have no clue where and how they spend their money.. you cannot deny that (i work in a bank w/ financing, loans etc...). There is also alot of lazy people, who hate their job and just want the clock to be 16.00. They will not progress in life, but thats their own damn fault.
About the college thing. Both my parents are professors at prestigues universities here in Norway.. I've gotten education hammered into me from day one, but I am able to use my brain and actually think about whats best for me, in the short and long term, and i couldnt see any reason for me to go to college, to get a degree in something i werent even interested in to make a smiliar income as i do now. 
You're able to make decisions when you're 18-21 years old..
Oh and btw, if you were from a 3rd world country i would agree with you chances of escaping poverty would be slim. However, you're from the US..

Why wouldnt it be? If you set your life up correctly you got a mortgage where you pay anywhere from 600-2000 a month (lets say 1200 in this example). lets say 300 on food, 150 on insurance, you dont need a fucking car if you live in a city. If not car might cost another 100 in insurance and gas. However, if you need a car, housing will be cheaper but hell i'll include it. Lets say another 1200 a year in repairs/upgrades on the house, so thats 100.
In total thats 1850 a month for a normal person, who lives alone and has nobody that shares expenses with him/her. 
Median income as you said, is 31k. Then you would pay about 12% in taxes.. You'll have 2.27k a month. Thats 423 dollars left every month. Lets say instead of 1200 monthly on the mortage you pay 600-700, then youll have   1k eaily left..
If you get a gf/wife/bf you can pay 50% on the loan each month, and youll have 1k of disposable income with a large mortgage...
I dont see the fucking problem mate, you set your life up correctly and saving 1k a month is easy.

its funny cause i never argued about his numbers but ok

Not in in my country buddy. We just pay 30% in taxes instead of 12%. But again, we actually have decent healthcare.
also to your other comment:
Ive included food, you dont pay childcare if you dont have children, neither do you need to pay for autocare if you dont have a car... Ive included insurance, but not health insurance because most countries have a decent healthcaresystem, unlike the US. Home internet &amp; cellphone is like 50$.
Yes ive left small things out, but you get my point. If you really have to spend all your money every month get a better paying job by proving your worth by working your ass off, or work more hours.
Most likely you just spend money on unnessecary shit, and you (not YOU but people in gerenal) are the ones to blame because their economic education is subpar.

over 10 years 100k is disposable income for 99% of people... 10k a year is easy to come by if you stop wasting money and got a full time job.......

1200 a month in childcare is insane. I was taxed 40% last year, but i dont fucking pay 1200 in childcare &amp; 700 for health insurance, nor do i pay 600 in property tax.
Studentloans ,car loans and mortgage is something you've decided to aquire tho, and you have decided to get children too while you knew the cost... However the health insurance and property tax is kind of insane imho.
I guess we're talking form two very different perspectives here, because we live in two very different countries. I'm from Norway btw.
"You don't seem to have a handle on anything" is kinda ignorant and rude of you to say hahaha damn. Enough said about that...

im not american, median income in my country is 50k

Do not agree. 1000 btc will move markets on individual exchanges, espescially with leverage, lets say you 25x 500 of your BTC, i bet that you'll liquidate alot of traders and move the price of bitcoin on that exchange significantly. We're talking 12.500 BTC being "traded".
If the move is significant enough, people on other exchanges might be willing to buy BTC up to the current "overvalued price" you created with your 500 btc, because they get "cheap bitcoin" on their currently exchange, and more than likely price will follow everywhere else.
Point being: Leverage makes it easier, and you don't need to move the whole market, you just need to manipulate the price on one of the major exchanges, and price will more than likely follow.
