What is this bit coin you talking about? Are they some sort of new collectible coins?

What did you use to extract the metadata? Seems like useful tool.

Looks great! 
Anw i think we really do need a central repository for bitcoin artworks.

Whats your tx id/transaction hash? It is safe to share this. Alternatively just paste the link from blockchain.info or any blockchain explorer showing your transaction.
Btw exchanges like GDAX usually require certain number of confirmations before crediting the funds into your wallet. The norm for BTC is 3 confirmations, i havent used GDAX so i'm cant tell for sure.

Are all the clues still valid?

It shows 4 confirmations at the moment
Each digital currency, has its own average time interval between confirmations, and requires a certain number of confirmations before it is credited to your account balance:
BTC: 6 confirmations (30 minutes on average)
BCH: 6 confirmations (10 minutes on average)
ETH: 50 confirmations (12 minutes on average)
LTC: 6 confirmations (30 minutes on average)
You need 6 confirmations for GDAX to credit your wallet.
It is on its way, all is good!

The irony this is ironic

anyone set up a brute force pool yet?
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:44:13
I'm guessing its a `m/49'/0'/0'/0/1` to `m/49'/0'/0'/0/0` change, so if you use default settings on electrum you could get the key. I have never actually used electrum so please correct me if I'm wrong.

Hey guys, while my brute force is running, I'm reading up on [BIP32 key derivation]( Does this mean we have to permutate all the way to `m/x1/x2/x3`? That's just way too many exes to find :\(
I'm still trying to grapple the derivation function sorry if I'm completely wrong.

Perhaps hint  - What wallet software was used to generate the private key
@_date: 2018-05-19 16:05:13
Note that its a P2SH public key too

Yea, you are right. This confusion may shy away adoption. But the misconception could potentially lead to theft with less careful laymen.

Besides that, blue elfs also roam in little mushrooms on your mother board. Each day at midnight the mushrooms spread their spores with the breeze generated by your cooling fans, colonizing other hardware. Jelly fishes swarm over your RAMs, feeding on electrical planktons. And that is the reason why your computers are slow. Be very afraid.

OP can decide that for himself. What he needs is both sides of the story.

Your private key is your coins. Anybody with it can transact your coins. Some addresses requires more than one private key to be authorized (multisig addresses). Welcome to crypto! (:
