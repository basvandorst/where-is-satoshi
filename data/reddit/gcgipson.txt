No, not at all.  I just want to know if the bitcoin community will be interested in my site.  I understand that trust is a hard thing to achieve but I'm willing to fight for it!

The site is copyrightXchange (
It's a patent pending exchnage market that I created.
It's a prototype website so please forgive the mess.
Try the demo, then write back to me and let me know if you would use your own bitcoin with such a business. That's all I want to know. Be honest. When you write back please give me your bitcoin address and I'll send the BTC. Thanks!

Ok thanks!  I'll have the details by mid next week.
