Its not really mining, its storing the blockchain. At the moment its 160gb or so, increasing the blocksize puts greater strain on the network and limits the people that can store the entire blockchain. However many would argue that modest steady increases in line with technology improvements would allow scaling. The problem is with people trying to run full nodes on bare minimum equipment. There is no danger of 1gb blocks coming quickly. That being said there is a fair argument for internet speeds not being able to keep up for non industrial scale people in the future with giant blocks. However the average user in the world in the future will probably be using an SPV wallet on their phone and won't need the entire blockchain anyway.

If the fee is even $10 to open a channel people will be having a lot of second thoughts about doing so. If it is complicated to do so you can just forget about the whole thing if one has to compare to other methods of payment. Now imagine if it was even more expensive....

I find it hard to read your point of view and take it seriously with so much emotion and profanity.  Perhaps stating things in a more academic way would help get your point across?

It is impossible to estimate what kind of fees there will be now. No one has any idea how much adoption will take place. Just like with segwit now. Things may be all roses. But no one can say with any kind of certainty how the market will react nor estimate the number of businesses that adopt LN nor what btc fees will be like in 1 years time either. Everyone hopes things improve and there is a lot of tech in the works that can certainly help things. But I think "likely be much much less" needs the qualifier "under ideal conditions of mass adoption which may or may not happen".

Very interesting. So you arguing that the utility of bitcoin has become far less important than the group think that it is a store of value. We think it, therefore it is?
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:08:34
Does this not also imply that bitcoin will become less and less flexible to change (innovation, improvement, decentralization) as fewer and fewer large stake holders resist in order to preserve their stake?

Like [this]( ?
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:37:29
What I was reaching for is that bitcoin seems to derive most of its value today from the belief that it is a good investment as opposed to the underlying tech is really useful. Money piling on other money.  Back in 2010 I remember thinking how revolutionary the tech was and the discussions  were about how many different industries it would disrupt/revolutionize. Correct me if I am wrong, but the discussion (ignoring the civil war) seems to be centered on mooning now.

Are you confusing full nodes with mining nodes?
@_date: 2019-04-09 16:13:36
No. That is not what I am talking about. We are talking about who gets to implement protocol rules. Non mining nodes or mining nodes. 
A non mining node can at best censor itself from the network. While I agree that non mining full nodes have their place in securing the network, they have NO IMPACT on the rule set. (edit typo)
@_date: 2019-04-09 05:03:18
ok. Lets make a bet. Lets start a new chain I will run 10 full mining nodes and you run 10 non mining full nodes and lets see who can and cant change the rules.

Thank you for the informative answer

Thank you again for the thoughtful reply. I am aware of Roger's former position as "Bitcoin Jesus" and the domains etc he bought/promoted/started at that time. However none of that has to do with the narrative that Roger was somehow the creator or instrumental in the creation of bch. I am trying to see where the line between the hate for Roger and the hate for BCH intercede and if its justified. Correct me if I am wrong but it seems to me that people hate Roger and his behavior first and foremost and have less issue with the coin and its actual dev teams. However that hatred gets muddled and less informed people think that because Roger is the self appointed spokesperson for BCH he some how has a leadership role in the project and therefore hate the project?
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:25:00
I have been involved with bitcoin since 2011 and have been following the scaling debate. However what I am missing is clear evidence that Roger helped create BCH despite what I see here and on social media. 
I understand everything you are saying about his actions as far as the bitcoin name and associated domains are concerned. However these are all things that have taken places after BCH was already created. Those issues are not what I am curious about at the moment. My understanding is that he hitched his wagon onto the already made BCH plan. That being said this is the first time I have seen anyone mention that he said Jihan was Satoshi. I have read the white paper, the Satoshi emails and his bitcointalk posts and Satoshi was clearly a native level English speaker where as Jihan is not. If you have a link to where Roger said he was Satoshi I would love to read that. Thanks.

The last sale in Bitcoin was some time ago. The last crypto transaction I got was in "bitbeans" while I shapeshifted into other coins immediately. So I can not say, however the last time I moved BTC wallet to wallet was a week ago and fees were high and the transaction was not instant like it was 4 years ago.

Another sad reality is that there are now an abundance of coins to choose from that suit people's particular needs better... for now. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:00:56
I am of course aware of that. But I am looking for insight into how exactly things unfolded and how involved/important relative parties are. It is very easy to find people who hate any given coin. However in the interest of self education I look beyond soundbites to decide for myself if things are as they seem. I was hoping that people here would have a lot of great information to help me see the truth.

As a retail owner who previously only accepted Bitcoin and now accepts every coin under the sun due to customer requests opening my eyes, I can honestly say that the backlog and high fees absolutely had a real world effect on my business. I am really really reaaaaly looking forward to this war ending one way or the other. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 04:12:02
My biggest worry, and anyone who works in retail knows this well, is the lost shopper. The person that walked away and found an alternative without saying a word and never came back. The people that in the last 2 years tried to get into bitcoin only to find is slow and expensive and then found an alternative that worked as they wanted or expected. Brand loyalty is a real and powerful thing. I 100% agree most shitcoins will die out. The worry for me is that after this war is over the first mover advantage will have been squandered and another coin will be the people's choice. Though there is no point in crying over spilled milk now. Whatever the outcome may be, I hope bitcoin can recover from this and that in the future debates can be settled in a better way.

That is a big if. IF LN replaces layer 1 no one will ever need to close a channel. However you still need to get funds into LN somehow. I am not aware of any way to create an LN wallet and still control your own keys and not have to open a channel yourself. It may be possible to "rent" an already opened channel at some point in the future. But that sort of throws the whole be your own bank and control your own keys thing out the window. Custodial services may be fine for some people. But I would never put a meaningful amount of money into such a thing.
