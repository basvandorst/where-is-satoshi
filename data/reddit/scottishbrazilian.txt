Ahright, so it still takes time, I'm new to this. I bought a tiny amount too so I think it won't be very high in terms of priority. Thank you for your reply.
If you don't mind me asking, where or how did you purchase it? I got mine from an ATM.

Ok, thanks for answering. :)
Hopefully mine comes through soon.

How long are people's transactions taking?
I bought some on Friday and it still hasn't appeared in my wallet.

Alright, thanks for the info. I thought they introduced because of the mass markets (China, for example) being unable to afford the 5S. Oh well, thanks again.

Apple don't appear to officially sell iPhone 5's anymore, but I believe the average number would be between £500-£550
Lowest brand new = £499.50
Highest brand new = £615.96
Buy iPhone 5 32GB - £500
Smash iPhone 5 32GB - -£500
Get rewarded with Nexus 5 32GB - £339
Total loss - £161
Still Wat.

Yeah, I was thinking of getting one because my phone was beginning to wear, but then I decided to book a holiday instead.

Well okay, I guess that compensates a bit, but are you telling me that if you bought a Nexus 5 right now, you would then spend the leftovers on another phone?
