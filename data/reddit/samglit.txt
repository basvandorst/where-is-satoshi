Apparently if he likes the conclusions.  Which isn’t a bad way to live, since FTL, teleportation, immortality and the singularity are mere years away.

No guarantee/chargebacks either.  I’ll stick with Visa for mail order, thanks.

Oh snap! Just like how Apple and Samsung are imposters of Nokia, because first movers always win! Time to fire up some Snake.

First 


What?  Are you replying to someone else?
Second, you are the one that spouted a throwaway one liner that Bitcoin is supreme, and all else imposters.  If you’re back pedalling now and saying, no wait, I only meant shitcoins =imposters, well thanks for the obvious lesson I guess?
Third, flippant remark gets flippant response.

Online crime in fiat usually does not adversely affect mom and pop consumers, who have intermediaries like banks, credit card companies, insurance and consumer protection laws to make them whole.
Bitcoin hacks are not reversible by design - this is not a feature in the eyes of most people who just want to save their money and buy stuff with it.

Yes that’s what insurance does, it distributes risk.  Whether you view it as unjust enrichment or a service provided by a middleman is a matter of idealogy.
However, the market seems to strongly favor giving middlemen a few points for peace of mind.  I wouldn’t buy a big ticket item like a TV online with bitcoin without an escrow service. But if I were going to pay the escrow guys, what difference paying the credit card companies who also provide considerable consumer protections?

How so? Not familiar with his audience, they’d have to be pretty special to have a lot of Bitcoin adopters.
