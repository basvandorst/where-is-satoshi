Rodolfo/Coinkite are well known in the community to manipulate upvotes for all their posts. Just keep this in mind next time you see their stuff here. It always has a bunch of upvotes immediately.

He is a dev troll. Pay him no mind.

This entire sub has turned to shit. These people can't even appreciate what Roger has done for Bitcoin. If he wants to waste $100K on his website, who cares? It's his money. Sounds like a bunch of haters crying like little girls. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 17:52:50
You're a big spammer on here, please stop. Please also stop manipulating up/down votes. It's so obvious. Everyone knows. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 02:50:56
So if I use Tor on Bitcointalk I have to pay?? That seems a bit of a ripoff, .07 btc isn't just a few pennies.... 
@_date: 2015-04-06 03:34:06
Can't you use something like Cloudflare to mitigate abuse instead of punishing those who are using Tor? 
@_date: 2015-04-03 14:02:24
And what peaceful act was he going to do with his illegally purchased gun and silencer?

@_date: 2015-09-04 22:56:31
Their API is impressive. Nice list!
@_date: 2015-09-13 23:08:51
On Friday I was showing a newbie how to use bitcoin for the first time. I sent them $5 in bitcoin and the tx took about 20 mins to show up in their wallet. I was totally blown and disappointed. Made the whole "move money fast" thing go down the toilet very fast as we sat there twiddling our thumbs. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 16:45:43
I quoted you from three weeks ago, dumbass. 




@_date: 2015-09-02 21:43:57
Bci does allow you to change fees, do custom tx's and all that 
@_date: 2015-09-24 00:08:33
Seems most plausible. Uncle Sam laying down the law. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 01:16:56


What's strange to me is how coinkite spams this sub constantly with diff alt accounts and manipulates upvotes (and down votes!) to game their posts. It's so obvious but everyone here eats it up. Also, why do their posts always get through with high votes? Did they pay ~~;~~ for exclusivity???? 
@_date: 2015-09-24 16:48:45
Nice try fudster!
@_date: 2015-09-24 18:18:13
Proof that you work/worked for Bitpay. Figure it out genius. 
@_date: 2015-09-08 01:40:39
Welcome back Jason! Although, you should probably check out other subs since this one has gone to shit. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 02:04:31
That's his MO. To try to throw wild accusations at the person calling him out to discredit them, making it possible to continue the shilling. I wish mods could do more but I think their hands are tied. just making you aware. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 18:23:15
yes, the agenda is the truth.
@_date: 2015-04-30 11:20:52


this is a problem, not a feature. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 22:42:32
@_date: 2015-09-25 03:25:56
At least Coindesk provided some proof about an email and subject matter. Not just rumor mill about people being around that may have seen someone getting fired. Right, real legit. 
@_date: 2015-09-07 12:15:03
It's a ponzi...
@_date: 2015-04-06 03:47:10
Ok I thought this was about something else like DDoS or something. 
If you can identify these 'bad users' by them creating accounts with Tor, can't you just enable greater restrictions on those newbie accounts on posting? Maybe longer period of waiting to post, and so on. 
@_date: 2015-09-06 14:31:28
I've never had probs with their wallet. It works great for me for small amounts on my mobile device 
@_date: 2015-09-04 22:59:13
Of course not they're small time compared to bci. It's funny all these "never had problems with X wallet" when they all pale in comparison to bci user base. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 16:31:08
if you haven't noticed, a month ago or so this sub went to shit when it went to censorship heaven and everyone and their mother has taken vengeance upon it. 
@_date: 2015-09-13 01:34:25
I wasn't talking about breadwallet ;) 
@_date: 2015-04-06 04:01:58
Faucets are a big scam and waste of time. A few pennies aren't a big deal. When it's a few dollars and up, that's a bit excessive. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 14:30:48
Lol I just spit out my coffee! thanks for the laugh 
@_date: 2015-09-12 12:51:55
Stress test is probably messing them up
@_date: 2015-09-20 02:29:37
Clearly they are a clusterfuck of an org without any leadership. Probably just a bunch of scammers. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 11:49:56
Seems so. This sub in general is dying. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 00:40:51
That seems to be the going trend these days. Stay away from btce for now. 
@_date: 2015-09-05 01:51:55
Scammers gonna scam 
@_date: 2015-09-24 23:38:34
The email yes, actually. This is status quo for these types of situations. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:25:54
Their mistake was saying forever. They should never have set that expectation.

@_date: 2015-09-24 22:18:12
You realize this is just recycled content from the person spamming here earlier about Bitpay layoffs, right? I'm not saying it didn't happen for sure. But right now there is ZERO proof. Just a couple of throwaway accounts saying they were fired. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 02:06:46
Just like how BitPay promised Free forever, right??? Things change. I wouldn't trust it. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 16:29:32


And to the little guys who are trying to get in, don't bother, because this "growing company" now has a "patent portfolio" and team of lawyers that you can't fuck with. So don't mess with them [Coinbase] or get sued to oblivion. Nice. 
@_date: 2015-09-18 20:35:16

Oh hey, a brand new account bashing bitpay. I know who you are.

Make note of who you are dealing with here. They cry about everything. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 20:30:09
lol i think their PR person is probably telling Brian Armstrong to stop already... 
@_date: 2015-09-20 02:24:08


So someone from ForkTheBanks was romantically involved with Abby?? It's hard to read the above, the grammar is terrible. Who wrote this then, if not Ingo Pless? 
@_date: 2015-09-30 22:44:42
TLDR; down to $10 from $75 from $100

@_date: 2015-09-04 13:48:15
lol no, there are many other people who are more likely. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 18:22:55


seems accurate to me...not sure why OP is saying this is tabloid garbage. this is accurate as it gets. for anyone that wants the real truth on the recent [REDACTED], go to for real questions/answers.
@_date: 2015-09-20 02:34:24
Nice username!
@_date: 2015-09-24 16:33:01
Considering you said they had layoffs three weeks ago 
And yet not one media outlet has mentioned any bitpay layoffs recently, leads me to believe you are full of shit. 
@_date: 2015-09-19 20:04:17
Daily Hashrate is satire, but the AbbyBitcoin being a fraud is actually a true story. It just came out today  
@_date: 2015-09-13 01:33:00
Not really. Mark owns a lot of Bitcoin related domains. He did hosting too through his company Tibanne. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:10:12
They have to recover from the hack somehow, which was their own fault. So, pass the cost on to their customers!! 
@_date: 2015-09-04 16:13:14
How can we "work together" when so many were banned from here? 
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:24:01
"Free forever!"
"Guys, we got hacked for millions!"
"No more free!"
@_date: 2015-09-13 23:12:23
I tried them a year ago, they were okay but seemed to have gone down hill more recently from some user feedback. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 16:17:38
too many to count..probably every major bank has 'researched' it in some way
@_date: 2015-09-24 00:25:15


oh, the irony. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 22:50:06
You clearly have no idea what's happened or going on. Simple buzzwords caused people to be banned. There was no justification. 
@_date: 2015-09-14 08:43:36
No 
@_date: 2015-09-23 15:01:56

@_date: 2015-09-24 22:19:16
Fair to me too. What's not fair is saying "free forever" and then start charging a year later.

Caracas is the capital. Nobody would go to the capital city to mine bitcoins! You can go to more mountainous regions where it's cooler and secluded to mine. It's an ideal country to mine due near zero cost of electricity.  
@_date: 2015-09-12 13:15:48
It's obvious to me but every time I say this competitors name my posts are downvoted to oblivion. But they are the only ones in this forum that manipulate votes to give their wallet an edge. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 11:44:18
You just proved Mike right by remaining silent on the subject, and resorting to a personal attack. Very low, and very telling. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 02:33:50
Pretty sure Ingo Pless is the board, CEO, and president of ForkTheBanks!

What do you expect when the mod of r/buttcoin is also a mod for r/bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-09-30 22:11:53
Basically, yeah.  Nothing revolutionary about it. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 23:37:33
Another fairly new Reddit account. Who is behind this attack on Bitpay? 
@_date: 2015-09-24 00:05:42
Exactly. I love bitpay actually, and hope they succeed. But you don't say free forever, and then a year later say, sorry no more free. It's just poor taste. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 22:16:28
Seems that way. But yet this sub will eat up the drama faster than a fat kid at McDonald's. 
@_date: 2015-04-03 14:12:21
I didn't know Bitcoin could go to jail. 
Btw, the whole mackerelcoin thing is really stupid. Prisoners writing down transactions and then collecting them at the end of the day to save in a centralized place! fail. 
@_date: 2015-09-14 08:45:24
No, I said it didn't even show up in the wallet for 20 mins. Probably because they were using Coinbase?
@_date: 2015-09-13 17:13:42

I'm helping bring transparency to the situation. Clearly you think it's okay for Coinkite to try to game the system, which isn't right. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 10:56:30
Great!! 
@_date: 2015-03-18 21:28:35
yes some of this is circumstantial, but it's pretty glaring at how obvious it is to everyone.

@_date: 2015-10-04 12:48:15
When this came up when MtGox started to implode and Karpeles said the issue was due to tx malleability, everyone said it was a non issue and blamed Karpeles. Now it's a "non issue" again. Right.

False - they just added in some google juice to also game SEO at the same time. Pretty shady stuff that Coinkite is up to.

it's a shill account, if you look at their history they posted that site in the past too. 
@_date: 2015-10-08 01:16:08

I didn't mean trading altcrapcoins. I meant actual exchanges, you know, like Gemini, Bitstamp, etc. actual exchanges where I can buy bitcoin with fiat money. Having this decentralized is a long ways off. The only close thing to that right now is Coinffeine.
