If you approve of this it basically shows you're interested mostly in Bitcoin's value to make you money, not its use in the real world. Buffet doesn't invest because he hasn't fully researched crypto, and he has no knowledge as to whether Bitcoin's value will go up or down. He's an investor, not a gambler.

Beats fill a gap in the market - a pair of fashionable headphones that are designed to be cool. They may not be good for an audiophile, but for a teenager who cares about style more than sound, they are indeed a good set of headphones.

Really? Bank transfers are nearly instant from my experience. The issue is when there is a change of currency. And I don't get how bitcoin will solve that.

There will come a point when people stop saying Bitcoin is the future and start looking at it just as a way to grow and store wealth.

Jobs will definitely be remembered.

Why does it seem that the bitcoin community wants to kill banks? I store my money in a bank and it's relatively safe and it earns interest. Right now there is no advantage at all to using bitcoin for an average person like me.

For a long time, Bitcoin has been working to get into the hands of everyday people and businesses, and this time round the crash is going to affect those people.
