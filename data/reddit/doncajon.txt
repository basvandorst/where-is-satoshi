Trying to learn it, I'm looking at the LN node explorer and I don't understand why I should care about the geographic topology much, as opposed to the payment channel capacity (the values they opened with, and/or the current balance). The map doesn't seem to tell me whether the channels that are next to me have opened with 0.01 BTC (meaning they'd get pushed to the hilt quickly) or 10 BTC. I only see id + age of the channels and alias + geographic location of the nodes.
Is there a reason why the channels' geographic locations and ages are important but the locked-in amounts (do we have a better word for that?) actually aren't?

I miss Zhou Tonged.
Days like these you can still rummage through his old stuff for a [song]( to fit the mood.

I think it must have happened this way:
* Mark secretly records the business meeting by placing a recording device (probably his phone with a recording app) in his jacket. You hear cloth swishing while he walks in. He probably does this with every important conversation to keep notes.
* Mark archives the recording on his computer / somewhere in MtGox's systems
* Russian hackers break in and find the recording, among other stuff.
* nanashi leaks the recording on  in order to get immediate credibility &amp; attention for his further information

yeah I also don't know why they made such a fuss about Sept 11th.
I mean 6 billion people made it just fine, right?

Wouldn't that be convenient. The buyer gets the customers and the customers get the debt.

Last I saw them on ustream they were loudly chanting towards the building "what do we want? BITCOIN! when do we want it? NOW!"
Occasionally two doormen would come out, looking very polite but telling them and gesturing to please keep it down (which the London guy sneakily filmed from below, probably in the hopes of catching an escalation).
As soon as the doormen were back in the building they'd resume the chanting. They probably saw that the doormen were phoning in the police now because they suddenly hurriedly packed up their stuff and the stream ended there.
I'm not so impressed with how they conducted themselves there, especially considering that MtGox had already left the building.

Facebook just acquired Whatsapp with 450 million active users for $19 bn, effectively paying $42 per user.
If it's true that MtGox is down 750k BTC then this would be a debt of 1.5 BTC per verified customer.
And of course the most active customers are verified on the other exchanges as well. All they want from MtGox/"Gox" is their money back and then it's bye bye forever.

I'd rather invest in a network connection + rates display than lose heaps of money to people who game the machine on bitcoin's volatility
@_date: 2014-04-19 22:19:25
Thanks for the heads-up! I just realized that they did this very thing to me.
I was definitely verified using the same kind of documentation that they are demanding now, more than a year ago.
I used to think that they had the best reputation and track record among the exchanges. Now I'm losing faith. This is totally unaceptable, especially without giving a reason or at least a notice.

While I don't think the outbursts are necessary, unfortunately this and the following thread are still by far the most sensible comments in this whole submission.

All I'm saying is when did you last spot the two of them in the same room at the same time?

Every single upvote disappoints me.
Being supportive of Bitcoin doesn't mean that you have to be a gun toating state hating libertarian.
If we're pushing this kind of culture, governments everywhere will shut Bitcoin down at every juncture where it touches the real world. They'd be crazy not to. You'd still be able to use it (on Tor and in dark alleys) but from a value perspective, paying taxes would have been cheaper.
Instead of giving the usual cherry-picked "I don't want to pay for bombing brown people" retort, think about who developed the infrastructure which the blockchain relies on. This would never have been possible in a libertarian wonderland, just like a whole host of other things you take for granted.

I'd say knowing about version control is already well within the average PHP-coder skill level, especially since the advent of git and the whole culture around it

Why would you doubt this reporter's claims when everything else in her article sounds so completely realistic?




@_date: 2014-04-19 23:09:57
what turned out to be the reason in your case? (if it's ok to ask)
I wonder whether I should simply re-verify (using the same passport scan and a more recent letter) or ask them to reinstate my verification, which was 100% in compliance with what they demanded then (and now).
But the whole thing looks really fishy to me. I'd also like to know what they're doing with the document scans, given what happened at MtGox.

apparently the token argument goes invalid after some time (status 403 forbidden)
This line will request a new token first:

every public key that ever held a single Satoshi can be found on the blockchain, so there's hardly any need to use a powerful computer to try and guess them.

well it seemed to run rather well for a year and handled 7% of the global bitcoin exchange volume according to bitcoincharts

You can see it best at clarkmoody. ([screenshot](
I've seen the rates jump from ~830 to 877 6x in a row now, precisely 5mins apart (while the lag keeps increasing at a constant rate with the time, so it sounds like the engine is stuck at ~18:48 UTC (12:48 ET))
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:59:32


I didn't notice it back then. Anyone have more info on this?
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:10:12
Why would one buy all the way down to $801 just as the $838.8 wall was finally coming down? Such flash sales are rather rare, especially in this situation.
My guess is it was supposed to become a wall at $901
@_date: 2013-03-06 09:28:21
can they even be shorted yet?
@_date: 2013-05-03 17:37:24
It would have been the responsible way if you'd contacted MtGox first to let them rectify this vulnerability... then again, what are the chances of them actually listening?

there was some monkey scratching itself at some point, but it was gone after 1 loop
@_date: 2013-03-22 23:05:26
someone (I forgot who) mentioned on the btc24 webchat that he expected it to get supported at 65, just when it started to fall through 69. I took a look at the depth chart and it looked like every full dollar level had about equal height (maybe 1.5k BTC for each) at the time and they seemed to fall at accelerating pace.
Yet it turned out that the fall really halted at 65.
So how did this happen, do buyers retract their offers during such a fall and gather at a "more reasonable" level? Is the depth chart even that indicative for the market mood or do most buyers resort to instant transactions?
@_date: 2013-05-03 17:25:48
I saw some lags building up to 30-40s during the last hours occasionally without much trading going on. Was that you?
How come I don't see any lag currently, as some people would surely be tempted to try themselves?
EDIT: there just was another lag hickup as I typed this, going up to 30s while trade volume stayed very low...
(btw I would advise not to try this. MtGox could very likely spot you)

at first it looked like two whales competing for in which direction to drive the index. But it kept going on with such regularity and ever increasing volume that it kinda looks orchestrated. But what sense does this make?
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:18:33
very interesting, thanks!
I wonder why nobody ever submitted that article back then though.
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:47:12
This seems to be correct, it's just some issue with blockchain.info
A transaction of mine got confirmed
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:39:46
every input transaction except the most recent 72BTC was done between last August and October (when the rates varied around $9 so this was ~$315k worth), so I'd say this probably has nothing to do with it.
