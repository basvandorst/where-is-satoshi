The definition of the word "money" is not a matter of opinion. It means something. In order for a thing to be money, it's value must be reasonably stable.
Will 1 BTC = $1000 USD or will 1 BTC = $10 USD two weeks from today? I don't know, and you don't know. That is why bitcoin isn't money. Money cannot work that way.

Of course you do. Most things are perishable, so you sell it until you run out of inventory. It's called cutting your loses, and of course it's something bagholders don't grasp.
If Blackberry can't sell a tablet for $500, they change the price to $400, and if they still can't sell it, they try $100. And it doesn't matter if it cost them $600 to make.
If Apple can sell a phone for $300, they sell it for $300. It doesn't matter if it only cost them $50 or $25 to make it.
Price is determined by demand, not by cost.

They said: You're speaking very matter-of-factly, when in reality you don't know anything more about what the future holds than anyone else does.
They were wrong about that. It wasn't difficult to assess the situation and realize that Ron Paul didn't have a snowball's chance in hell of winning the election. Similarly, it isn't difficult to assess the situation and realize that Bitcoin doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell of becoming worth $10,000 per coin.

Gold isn't money either.
Money is a tool used to ease trade. One party completes a service or transmits a good, and the other party gives a set amount of money. That is a more efficient way to trade than having to exchange one good for another good, or one service for another service.
In order to do this, money must have a stable value. If I sell you something for $50, I have to have a good idea of what $50 is worth. And what it will be worth tomorrow and next week.
If the value of a thing changes everyday in an unpredictable way, it is not useful for trade like money is—and therefore it is not money. It's more like a commodity.
You can, of course, trade one thing for another thing, rather than selling it for money. And that is what you are doing when you buy or sell an item for bitcoin.

When do you expect these marketing efforts to become successful and actually raise demand for bitcoins? 
@_date: 2014-10-11 19:30:37
Most companies don't actually accept bitcoin, they just pretend to.
Coinbase accepts the bitcoin, then pays the company cash. So the company itself never holds, or dumps, the coins.
When coinbase goes out of business, and it will, those companies that use coinbase will no longer pretend to accept bitcoin. 
And that should bring this interesting experiment to it's conclusion.

If bitcoin was real money, you could negotiate a lease of like 4 bitcoins per month for a year.
Unfortunately, since bitcoin isn't real money, neither you nor your tenant know what 4 bitcoins will be worth in a year. Could be $50 or could be $10,000. No sensible person would enter a negotiation like that.
So, instead, you will have to agree to use real money to set the price, and then convert back and forth to bitcoin values every month.
The whole exercise shows us exactly why bitcoin isn't real money, and won't ever be. Real money is a great tool for negotiating leases.

Apparently you have never priced an item.
You price things for exactly as much as you think you can get for them.
If you can get $10 for an item, you price it at $10. If you can get $50, you price it at $50. If you can only get $1, you sell it for $1.
It doesn't matter if it cost you $1 or $100. You sell it for what you can get.

There is no advantage to the US consumer to convert their cash into bitcoin, just to then buy an item with bitcoin that they could have bought with cash. It adds hassle, time, middle-men, thinking, risk and uncertainty to a process which should minimize all of those things.

@_date: 2014-10-18 00:25:26
I'm not anyone of importance, but that's the case with me. I assume there are 1,000s of others in the same boat, every week. Last weekend I happened to spend with a dozen college friends (big chill style), and I assumed none of them had even heard of bitcoin. But when I brought it up, half of them had studied it and determined like me that it was absurd. One of them was a coder who even owned some doge, but acknowledged the blockchain wasn't scalable, and there was no compelling reason for average people to buy bitcoins. Yes, I realize that is entirely anecdotal. But at least amongst my circle of friends, it rings true.

You know what I can do with real money? 
I can negotiate a year long lease with a tenant. We can both agree that he will pay me $2000 USD a month, for a one year period. We can feel comfortable agreeing to that, because we both know approximately how much effort will be required on his part to acquire $2000 one year from now, and approximately how much buying power $2000 will get me one year from now.
If it can't allow two parties to negotiate like that, then your "money" simply isn't "real money". Any fiat that allows for the negotiation I've described above is real money.
You know what else I can do with real money? I can loan people tens of thousands of dollars, which they agree to pay back at a steady annual rate with a steady annual percentage cost. 
With something as volatile and unpredictable as bitcoin, it is simply impossible to create a 20 year loan. Or a year long lease. That is why bitcoin isn't real money.

They don't. They accept dollars from bitpay or coinbase. They don't ever touch bitcoins. Why would they? Real companies are interested in receiving real money.
Sorry if you haven't researched bitcoin enough to realize it isn't real money, but it really isn't.
Let me tell you what I can do with real money. I can negotiate a lease with my tenant, where she agrees to pay me $2000 a month for a year. The reason we can agree to that contract is because we both know approximately what $2000 will be worth a year from today. That is why dollars are real money—they can be used in long term contracts. We could never negotiate a 4 bitcoin per month lease, because neither of us can know what the buying power of 4 bitcoins will be a year from now. And that is why bitcoin isn't real money.
When you are old enough and established enough to start leasing property, you might have a better understanding of the purpose of real money.

If this is what happens, crypto isn't currency. Stop calling it that. Currency is stable, that is the whole point. It allows me to negotiate year long leases, because I know and my tenant knows approximately what $2000 will be a year from now.
Unless you can do that with something, it is not currency. It's gambling.

That has absolutely zero to do with the negotiation of a lease. In order to negotiate a lease both the landlord and the tenant have to have a good idea about what the currency they are negotiating with will be worth at the end of the lease.
Since bitcoin does not allow either party to have a good idea of it's likely worth a year later, it isn't real money. That is why all leases the planet over are negotiated in real money, rather than bitcoins.

The reason the price falls is because everyday less people want to own bitcoin than the day before. Demand goes down, and price goes down. This is how marketplaces work.
And always remember, the bulk of the trading takes place in China. The chinese aren't reading r/bitcoin. They aren't libertarians. They aren't concerned about remittance. They aren't dodging taxes. They aren't using bitcoin to buy drugs or CP. They don't pay for Microsoft products and they don't know what a college football bowl is. They also don't worship Ver or Andreas or Gavin or Satoshi.

Democratic Socialists believe the State is, or at least should be striving to be, a representation of the will of the people. As a reflection of the will of the people, it can take resources from the 1% and redistribute them to the community at large if the community so desires.
One way in which the State (aka the will of the people in a socialist context) exerts control over the 1% is by controlling the currency.
If you are a socialist, you believe in giving the State all the tools it needs to service the will of the people, including but not limited to, control over its currency.
Bitcoin is a project that tries to reduce the power of the State. Socialists want to increase the power of the State.

I am quite familiar with Dunning–Kruger. (FWIW, it's Dunning–Kruger.)
It is what drives bitcoinists to believe they have a better grasp of the economy than actual economists like Paul Krugman. It is what drives bitcoinists to believe they have a better grasp of remittance than companies that specialize in it like Western Union. It is what drives bitcoinists to believe they understand PR better than actual advertising agencies, which lead them to believe that changing the name of Beef O Brady's Bowl to Bitcoin Bowl was meaningful.
It is what makes bitcoinists go on and on about "fundamentals", a word they clearly have no understanding of. It is why bitcoinists draw rainbow log-charts and discuss fibonacci accordions, as if they are legitimate financial tools.
It is what makes bitcoinists think bitcoin will end the nation state, or warfare, or asset forfeiture.
It is what makes bitcoinists think banks and/or governments pay "shills" to come to and laugh at them.
The fact that hilariously overfloweth with examples of Dunning–Kruger is what brings me here in the first place!
