why do bitcoin people always have to talk like the "i am very smart" retards 
@_date: 2014-04-05 01:25:04
so when do the bitcoins become american money and given to Dorian?
@_date: 2014-03-05 04:06:48
I'm going to buy so much BTC and charge it all back in a couple weeks.
@_date: 2017-02-03 22:56:34
Nobody actually cares about bitcoin.  They care about how much it's worth in US dollars 
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:48:36
This is likely bullshit, but in case it's not, this is deathly serious for everyone including OP, TBI, the foundation, Mark, etc.  
Anyone provably complicit in this supposed conspiracy to defraud customers of $215M is at serious risk of going to jail.
@_date: 2017-02-11 05:56:07
Lol it's the only thing people care about
@_date: 2017-02-11 04:54:03
Sure I'm just dispelling some of the delusions people seem to have about it.  People really only care about us dollars, and that's about it
@_date: 2017-02-11 04:48:54
Oh I think that's fine but the only reason people care about bitcoin at all is because of its apparent value in USD, which is actually what they care about.
@_date: 2017-02-11 03:21:06
nobody actually cares about bitcoin.  they care about how much it's worth in us dollars.  it's like a bunch of fucking beanie baby hoarders around here
@_date: 2017-01-06 03:59:23
btc-e just has a fucked up SSL certificate.  They're not getting ddos'd
@_date: 2017-01-06 03:54:40
anybody with a botnet could ddos the exchanges for ransom during high volume events.
they do it to sports betting sites all the time during big sporting events.  extortion

@_date: 2017-01-05 23:04:27
i care more about the usd value because that's what i buy things with
@_date: 2017-01-06 00:01:21
@_date: 2017-01-06 04:22:23
I'm sure they would love to have to pay even more fees to have their paycheck transferred into spendable money than they already do
@_date: 2017-01-06 05:20:06
I wonder how many millions coinbase lost today because they couldn't execute any trades
@_date: 2017-01-06 08:56:01
this sub has so many dumb people
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:09:20
god this sub is fucking useless
@_date: 2017-01-06 07:08:08
It takes 48 hours because it is literally offline storage.  The transfers have to be done manually and I assume they do them in batches.  Maybe you should just keep all your coins in your regular wallet of you need them right away
@_date: 2017-01-06 07:36:12
@_date: 2017-01-06 04:37:31
yeah I'm sure they'd love to ride the hourly bitcoin rollercoaster instead.
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:00:36
fee is too small
@_date: 2017-01-06 03:44:12
this sub is full of these techno religious whacktards.  and the rest are just obsessed with how many american dollars they can make.  and the memes.
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:08:57
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:02:36
stop posting this
@_date: 2017-01-06 03:49:07
it's actually from some alcoholic's drunk rant on a forum a few years ago
@_date: 2017-01-06 02:14:08
nobody here actually cares about bitcoin.  they care about us dollars and how many millions they're going to make with their bitcoins.  everyone in this sub will dump their coins immediately if the usd value became life changing.  and they'd never touch bitcoins again. that's 95% of the people here. 
the other 5% are techno religious whacktards that think everyone should be buying their coffee and bagels with bitcoins while the value fluctuates ridiculously from day to day, or hour to hour 
And then there's the memes
@_date: 2017-01-06 03:47:25
@_date: 2017-01-02 19:43:50
Probably not as easy now as it was 10-15 years ago.  Intel benefits from PC CPU competition to avoid antitrust concerns.
@_date: 2017-01-06 09:00:19
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:14:17
it's back up because coinbase api is back online now and everyone's orders are executing.
@_date: 2017-01-06 07:10:47
this is the shittiest image host
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:08:00
the usd value is the only thing anyone cares about right now.  this sub is obsessed with it.  that and memes 
@_date: 2017-01-06 07:24:26
why are you mad it takes 48 hours
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:47:54
why do bitcoin people always say such dumbass stuff
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:58:56
yeah I'm going to go ahead and guess that they don't actually accept bitcoins but instead some joker just slapped a bunch of stickers on their cart
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:26:31
God this community is just full of dumb asses
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:02:48
kind of a dumb name for a human baby
