You should plan on waiting many weeks to get a response from coinbase, however coinbase frequently will not reply at all.  I would recommend you look into other exchanges such as gemini.

nope, i saw the news.  I'm down to pay for the wall, especially if mexico will pay us back later.  We will save so much money from keeping out all the mexicans and central americans that load up our social programs and other handout programs, we should see ROI in no time for the wall.
And maybe you missed the news, mexico is going to pay us back for the wall when we renegotiate NAFTA.  
And maybe you missed the news, ford just canceled a billion dollar plant in Mexico and will build in Michigan instead.

Yep, exactly, then people wouldn't have been inconvenienced.  


Why would you need 5 burner accounts if they have their compliance in check?  Wouldnt compliance catch multiple accounts, i mean they have a bitlicence right?  And how could people still buy bitcoins with circle if they were closing down bitcoin purchases? 


What, they have a bitlicence so all should be good with compliance.  Just address compliance issues as they pop up like every other exchange.  


I know, why not give people a heads up so they can take their business elsewhere if circle is no longer going to provide the service.  As you know, it takes time to get set up and verified on any exchange.  
@_date: 2017-01-07 23:29:36
Yeah, coinbase treats people like shit.  I figured who better to satirically answer coinbase support problems than myself, If gemini is not available in your state you may also want to look into liberty x, or a cash deposit for bitcoin at localbitcoins or bitquick.co
Best of luck getting a competent and helpful reply from coinbase!

Coinbase is not honest or pro-bitoin, please dont tell people that.  Coinbase will cancle your buys and sell when it is profitable for coinbase to do so, and coinbase CEO bad luck brian loves to pump shitcoins.
It is best to keep low expectations when doing business with coinbase.
@_date: 2017-01-09 16:15:20
So according to taviiii they closed down because of compliance hurdles, but according to you they helped bitcoin by being fully compliant.  Shit doesn't add up there, you guys should get your story straight. 
People who are angry at circle are tax evaders and drug enthusiasts?  Nice straw man argument.  If circle has a bit license and is fully compliant with local/federal regulation why would drug pushers and tax evaders use that service?  Shit doesn't add up here either.  I can see logical reasoning is not your strong point.
They said, “Our view is that we’re still in the really early stages of the technology and its development. It’s highly unlikely that any of us will be using Bitcoin in five or ten years. In the same way that – how many of us use NCSA Mosaic or Netscape Navigator?”
Does that sound like building an open source settlement platform using bitcoin to you?  Why build and expand a service that no one will be using in 5 years?

Capital gains are 0% for an individual up to around $30,000 and around $70,000 for a married couple.  I doubt many redditors sold more than that on coinbase each year, i would guess most people selling on coinbase will fall into the 0% bracket anyways.

Your question illustrates why its not a good idea to keep bitcoins on coinbase  If you can’t see your bitcoins on the blockchain and if you alone don’t control the private key of the bitcoins, then the bitcoins aren’t really yours.

I think gender pronoun jokes are great, its funny as fuck that people want society to play into their game of make believe.  When a baby comes out the doctor says, its a boy or its a girl, the doc never says well lets wait till the baby is 16 and see what it identifies as.

Bitcoins are limited in supply, only 21 million will ever be made.  The value of the bitcoin is determined by the market.  I believe there will be another bitcoin boom.
You will need some money to buy your first bitcoins, but learning about bitcoin is free and i would recommend reading about wallets and bitcoin more in general before you buy your first bitcoins.

Yeah medicine has made some pretty wild science experiments.  They can make a man look like a woman and vice versa by suppressing and taking different hormones.  
That doesnt change the gender of the individual though, it just changes what they look like.  A guy who cuts his dick off is still a guy, they have y chromosomes in every cell of their body.
This is the difference between genotype (Cant be changed) and the phenotype (can be changed with lots of hormones and drugs).

Please don’t talk about coinbase's founders like that, It hurts s feelings.  There are many fees that coinbase offers that circle does not offer to their customers.   At coinbase, there is a higher bitcoin prices and fees because there are high costs associated with compliance with the federal government.  It takes lots of money to monitor everyones bitcoin activity and report you little shits to the IRS, FINCEN, or whoever coinbase deems the appropriate authorities are.

It doesnt really effect my life, fat people or transgender people.  Its probably the attention seeking behavior and victim mentality in both situations that makes me dislike them.  And its not even that i dislike them on an individual level, its the insistence that i accept them as beautiful as they are in the case of fat people or the gender they are pending to be when it comes to transsexuals.  That aspect of it is hilarious to me.
Isn't the flip side to that no one would want to be fat unless they really were sick because it would suck being a lard ass.  Fat people put up with a ton of shit too.  Changing gender and becoming fat are alike in that its not an instant process in either case.  They start normal and after a long time of doing weird shit to their body, the look weird as fuck at the end.

Testis-determining factor (TDF), also known as sex-determining region Y (SRY) protein, is a DNA-binding protein (also known as gene-regulatory protein/transcription factor) encoded by the SRY gene that is responsible for the initiation of male sex determination in humans.[2] SRY is an intronless sex-determining gene on the Y chromosome in therians (placental mammals and marsupials);[3] mutations in this gene lead to a range of sex-related disorders with varying effects on an individual's phenotype and genotype.

You are right.  It would take more than just the cryptographic signature to definitively prove it was satoshi.  
However, for people without the signature i think its safe to rule them out as satoshi.
So because Gavin was never given a verifiable cryptographic signature, he should have never proclaimed craig wright satoshi to the economist or the BBC like he did.

Coinbase regularly reduces customers limits, regardless of how much verification you have already provided.  I would recommend looking into a different service to buy bitcoins from like circle.com, gemini.com, localbitcoins.com, or bitsquare.io

Yeah there are some hermaphrodites but they are really rare as you were saying.  Most transsexuals just randomly identify as the opposite gender as some kind of teenage angst.  
The hermaphrodites are treated from early life, so they dont end up like bruce jenner looking and sounding like a man in a dress

I think its many times more likely that satoshi is nick szbao and or hal finney than craig.  Hell, even dorian seems more likely to be satoshi than craig when you look at the big picture.
The fact that craig is trying to convince people he is satoshi with bad or misleading data seriously damages his argument IMO

Yep, some people still post over on in 2016.  Not many though because after the biggest bitcoin bubble popped, the value of a bitcoin is up drastically.  Infact, bitcoin has been flirting with an all time high market cap recently.  
Luckily i have so much bitcoin that have been using it to buy things like sports cars and a condominium in Key West Florida instead of coffee.  When i bought my car, I happily waited the 15 minutes for a confirmation while i took my new Porsche for a test drive.
Anyways, enjoy moderating and jacking it to trannies

coinbase has shut down comments in thats why people come post their coinbase complaints in My hope is that people will start to post their coinbase complaints over in my subreddit so this one will be less cluttered with coinbase issues.

Ill just break it to you now, you aren't going to get your account unlocked if coinbase caught you spending bitcoins on something naughty.  No specialist is looking into it either, coinbase is just stalling for time and will not contact you with a solution to your problem.
I would recommend looking into purchasing bitcoins on circle, gemini, or localbitcoins.
Please join us in our coinbase support subreddit if you need further assistance.

Yes, in part.  Trump being elected caused a spike in the demand in bitcoin, and coinbase regularly goes down during periods of high demand because of a poorly designed infrastructure.  
@_date: 2016-11-08 06:15:07
Unfortunately, none of that matters to coinbase and your limits were reduced regardless.  If you have lots of patience, you can choose to put up with it and re upload all your documents and wait while coinbase reviews them.  However, if i were you i would buy and sell bitcoins somewhere else like circle, gemini, or localbitcoins.

Its interesting to me transgender people are more interested in becoming the opposite sex than they are interested in feeling comfortable in their own skin as their biological sex.  Transsexuals are willing to go through great lengths to change their appearance, and some feel they are entitled, society should pay for their "medical operation"
What if more science is done and they end up finding a cause and there is a pill or a shot people cant take so they feel the same gender as their biological sex?  Why is there so little science and doctors and effort being made to make people happy as they are? Its all about vaginoplasty and putting a fake nut sacks on chicks so they can feel like men.  And a high percentage of people transition and still aren't happy, or transition back to what they actually are.
You are treating a disease, with drastic measures and procedures, before you even know whats causing it.  Sad really.

I was talking with a transgender individual in this very thread who insisted that transgenderism was from the fetal hormone levels.  
I agree with you that transgenderism is psychological, but I think you would get a lot of push-back from the transgender community because a large portion feel that its more than psychological.

Coinbase is not required by law to prohibit posting in I was a coinbase customer too, and then i did some research and learned coinbases fees are higher than many other services and the other companies dont have activist CEO's either.
Why did you feel the need to say "not funny" instead of just moving along like the thousands of other things on the internet you dont agree with?  The answer is you were triggered with butthurt.
@_date: 2016-11-06 23:51:21
It says, 
Data on genetic and hormone independent influence on gender identity are presently divergent and do not provide convincing information about the underlying etiology. To what extent fetal programming may determine sexual orientation is also a matter of discussion. A number of studies show patterns of sex atypical cerebral dimorphism in homosexual subjects. Although the crucial question, namely how such complex functions as sexual orientation and identity are processed in the brain remains unanswered, emerging data point at a key role of specific neuronal circuits involving the hypothalamus.
Sounds like they haven't figured it out yet.

There is only one version of bitcoin.  Other crypto coins, like etherirum, have multiple versions because they have had what is called a hard fork.
There is a small group that wants to increase the block size in bitcoin, but they havent changed the code or forked bitcoin.  Increasing the block size would allow more transactions to take place, but it would increase the size of the blockchian database that records all transactions.  Luckily, a solution called the lightning network will soon be implemented in bitcoin and that should take care our "full block" issue.

You would surely cite older studies that have been debunked as well.  Studies that cisphobic trans people use to justify their hatred of us cis folk.  
I could, if I wanted to waste the time doing so, cite you two whole truckloads of other studies that say the opposite, but you wouldn't care because that doesn't support your narrative of bigotry so I won't waste my time.

Fair enough, i wouldn't call $3-10 dust or spam either.  When you said lots of inputs i assumed you had a bunch of inputs less than a dollar to end up paying a $1 fee.

In the voice of dude leboski, That's just your opinion, man
I am not against a block size increase, i just don't understand why it is such a big deal for some people.  I remember when you could send coins with 0 fee and get confirmations quick, and that was great.  But honestly paying a few cents for a transaction isn't a big deal for me.
