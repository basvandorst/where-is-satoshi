I've installed and repaired thousands of SCOs for walmart and this would be a fucking nightmare to support if walmart implemented it.

He's got his tinfoil hat on.  He's not wrong.  He's just selling to the wrong person.
You're obviously not concerned about any 3 letter agencies.
I can go to a store that's a mile from my house and pay cash for a raspberry pi that's been sitting there for months.  The chances of a 3 letter agency interfering with that raspberry pi are slim to none.  But if an agency targeting you sees a package in route from an electronics manufacturer, will intercept the shit out of it and backdoor the fuck out of it.

Does this thing have a BNA or single note acceptor? If it has a single note acceptor that's going to suck.  Feeding multiple bills in one at a time is ridiculous.
They should have designed software for existing ATMs.  That way you're still generating revenue from cash withdrawals in between (what I expect to be) far and few between bitcoin customers.
EDIT:   It's got a single note acceptor.

dude you should totally make software that does that.  it's no longer a copy of a copy if you fucking hand perfect it.

Are they keeping the handprints?  I would think 24 hours is all they need to prevent people from going over the limit.

Never put anything past the US Governement.   You see what corporations are capable of, the US Govenrment has literally unlimited resources.
