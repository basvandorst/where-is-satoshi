I thought it was a pretty good scam to be honest. Could have just reset it to be sure and then there wouldnt be a issue.

Yep that's why I use one.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:10:20
I have some understanding of that my point was if all miners stopped then bitcoin wouldn't die "someone" at least would mine and things would adjust.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:03:51
If this is the sole purpose of btc it will have been worth it. A more generous world is very much a good thing.

@_date: 2017-12-21 06:10:48
Not sure if the word is out or what but banks in nz are starting to do the same. We can expect this with btc and the likes it goes against everything they do. Can't really blame them, but you don't have to put up with it. I actually think it's a good thing it will bring on the demise quicker.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:20:12

I believe if addresses start with a 3 they support segwit. I may be wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:51:46
As it has been said all cryptos have to grow and get through the growth phase. Btc is out on front by mile the rest are just hoping they make it where btc is now let alone where it will be in 12 months time or two or three years.

@_date: 2017-12-10 08:12:53
3 billion in btc, that's amazing glad they got those 2.5 billion btc out of the criminal hands. Now they just have to make sure they store these 2 billion in btc offline so that nobody steals these 1.5 billion in btc. Because in less than a few years these 1 billion in btc is going to be worth a fortune. Etc etc.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:53:20

@_date: 2019-07-10 07:15:53
You not suppose to at some point hopefully it will be worth more than fiat and you just use the btc to buy what ever.

@_date: 2017-12-01 20:31:26
I think this is the correct assessment. You can wish and dream as much as you like but the HODLers will set the price in the long run. And lightning will move it more main stream. They will make some money but no more than trading anything else.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:35:05
Hard to see how so many waiting to just get access and learn how to do it. Can't see.it goibg down to much not u til at least Feb. But if it climbs till Feb I don't see it happening then either no way it would.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:05:50
I know that I am talking in reference to this info that all miners would stop mining. I understand what the current situation is.

Could someone explain to me I am looking at getting into bit coin (as a user not a trader). I am in AU. i get the whole trade bitcoin etc, but how can i do it without having to go to someone for cash? Limited where I am due to location?  Is am i missing the whole point of it? How or when will bitcoin detach from fiat?
@_date: 2015-06-29 09:25:56
Could you give me the short version of how it works and what info they would need?
@_date: 2018-08-28 20:47:00
Audio is complete crap. Even had headphones on and it was still crap.
@_date: 2015-06-29 10:55:21
I know its not attached, but the reality as you have stated is we would need to trade it for Fiat, when if ever will we be able to trade purely in a  crypto currency? Is that the end game are we on the path to that or is it all a pump and dump for the traders?
@_date: 2015-06-29 11:38:07
sound advice if a little preachy, but thats fine. I am generally a fan of bitcoin and hope we can all move to a unregulated crypto currency and have a level playing field for the whole world. I dont have a issue in the slightest for working or having some value behind bit coin I am asking because I am struggling to see a way forward where it will become what I would liek it to be, a untaxed global currency that has the same value no matter where you are on the planet, as I believe its one of the paths to a better world for all, so much of life's slights are due to people having a certain advantage over others.
@_date: 2018-08-06 19:44:16
Correction they own some btc.
@_date: 2018-08-05 03:52:15
Because if you read up on the info its essentially a LN network that is proprietary to them. Other than a few minor differences that's exactly what it is. Powers that be wanting to get there claws into crypto and maintain control. Not saying it's all negitive but without decentrilisation someone will always be clipping the ticket and it will therefore always cost more.
@_date: 2018-08-04 05:20:05
Sounds like it's just another LN off chain system that they own. No sure it is really what everyone Hope's it is.

@_date: 2018-05-14 02:11:42
As someone that was a licenced hand gun owner in Australia and had long arms as well, i know without a fact that even if they had weapons the outcome would have been the same. Au is not like usa and guns are severely controlled to the point that in an emergency event you will not be able to access weapons. If you do manage to get to your gun and defend yourself you are well within your rights to use deadly force to defend yourself. But even when you do you will need to prove that you did everything you could before getting your gun and defending yourself. Feel free to think what you like as a legal firearms owner i know what the reality and the law is. Making blanket statements about self defense is not a creditable argument.

Agree with you in the sense they will spam it and likely some fools will buy it. My point is Facebook money is just another fiat so why not just use fiat. Comparing facedollars to btc is like comparing a horse to a giraffe they are not even the same thing. People with a brain will understand this. Those who just follow the hype will be caught up in the bs. And if you think facedollars are going to ever be worth more than 1 fiat dollar in cou ty of origin I have some Netscape bucks for you as well.
@_date: 2018-06-24 02:18:18
That will do bot, that will do...
@_date: 2019-06-20 18:33:37
People are.already getting paid in btc, at some point I believe its feasible for btc to do everything. But going with the premise that you need to convert to fiat with btc you chose where and when and none is tracking all your spends especally if your using lightning. I may be wrong let's just wait and see. My guess is facedollars will be dead out of the gate. Time will tell.
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:32:49
I believe so at least it has so far at 11k now.
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:36:47
The correction is here, it's going back to where it should be. Dont be fooled btc is the OG goat.

No idea and don't really care. People have to learn to think for themselves. If you can't do that then you will always just follow anyway. Critical thinking is a dying art so bots are just part of that filter.

Because no one knows it could just as easily go to zero. And that's a fact.
@_date: 2019-05-29 08:14:30
This sounds like such a rubbish post. Glad you have your coins but your facts are all over the place. Maybe take some time and go back over every step you made. I am sure you missed a step somewhere and started blaming the device. Updates have to be done sequentially and as such you need to get all steps right to completion before moving on.

If your getting a 6 figure bonus and dont know how to manage money and your bank accounts and are coming to reddit for advice then I just feel sorry for you. Like that say a fool and his money are easily parted.
