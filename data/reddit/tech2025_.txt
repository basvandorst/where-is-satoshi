Unfortunately Never
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:09:02
I also have like $2 in bytecoin lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:00:02
I thought altcoin branched off BTC were affected by BTC price but it sure doesn't appear that way. 400% increase in a  month. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:01:13
I'm so mad with coinbase lol, they never reply to support emails, have super high fees, need to verify an ID(thought crypto was supposed to be anonymous) 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:14:52
Freewallet on and oír has like 30 wallets included an no ID of any kind required
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:01:49
Freewallet seems great so far. Only downside is it's minimum withdrawal amounts
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:35:20
Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:18:48
Is there some cheap fee way to transfer everything from coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:55:01
Sell to PayPal? I don't have that feature.... 
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:24:36
Do you have a tutorial o yiur website or something? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:02:34
$1000 in February? Maybe my. Memory is just failing lol, I'd have to check my logs for exact amount at the time I bought it
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:34:43
Yep, lol I'm only 15 so I use my mom's. I recommend you don't use your actual name for things like this. Also, if available, frost bank has bank accounts for people starting at 14 years old. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:01:41
I might not do it, it's a 2.5% fee plus ID verification required 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:11:07
My problem is I don't have an ID, not old enough to drive yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:05:30
You have won the internet 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:45:40
Why is there even an r/btc 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:56:23
Yeah, good opportunity, but I don't have any spare money to invest in a coin at this price. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:58:34
Emergency account, not spare money account lol. I doesn't appear that I've made a mistake investing in Dogecoin either 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:57:06
Already pulled all my BTC funds lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:59:13
Yes, I'm done with Bitcoin for this year, going to invest in Dogecoin, it's up 400% this month lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:55:08
This sounds very passive aggressive lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:55:44
Exactly. No I think they're doing this so people don't switch services after their little insider trading incident 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:50:11
Thanks for explaining, I had no idea that was going on
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:19:52
2ould your parents or someone older than you let you use their ID for this? There might be an "update" or "change" ID button
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:59:14
I would, but BCH people are messing everything up, looking for a short time investment. Switched to dogecoin. Already made a couple dollars in profit in less than a dau
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:27:44
Not a book but you should watch "Banking on bitcoin" 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:56:48
Just found it. Thanks ns
@_date: 2018-05-07 04:06:12
Where is this from? Can you provide a link?
@_date: 2018-05-12 19:56:05
Good thing I pulled my funds before this KYC crap. Get a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:37:45
Definitely check out freewallet. Has like 30 different currency wallets. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:22:01
I hate Memes. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 04:20:02
Sorry it was a typo
@_date: 2017-10-31 04:19:53
Sorry misspelled it
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:02:30
Coinbase is a great app, you can buy/sell BTC, Ether and LTC
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:52:12
As far as I know BCH is doing really bad, and there's no predictions o a good price raise
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:00:36
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:54:09
Yep, maybe a good option when it gets super low to buy some
@_date: 2017-10-31 04:20:18
Sorry about that it was a type
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:36:15
Definetly, buy now people say it'll go up to $7000
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:48:15
I would buy now, x2 is going to raise the price, not to mention it is believed it will be $7000 in the near future
