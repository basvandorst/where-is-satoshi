They aren't "shrills", kid. They are people that are making sure you don't shoot yourself in the foot when claiming/not claiming investments. It's the reason why large companies and firms have the best and brightest tax lawyers. It's an important thing to take into consideration. You can argue for or against how our taxes are spent and how much we should pay and who should do what with them, but that's a much larger conversation for a different sub. 
When we say, "pay your taxes", we're saying, be smart.

Can you not declare losses?
I know very little about tax law, but am assuming it would be treated as any other investment and you can report "unrealized losses" against the gains.

Anyone know what policy this could be against?

Sounds like you weren't prepared. You went to buy a car with nothing?

Just bought my first coin, only $40 worth, this morning. Fun to see the upward trajectory.

I assumed it would process faster, is that not true? I know it comes with a higher limit.
