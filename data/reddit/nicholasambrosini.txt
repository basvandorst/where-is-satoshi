Very true indeed. Luckily(even though we're all just stranger's) this stranger happens to know a couple econ power-houses which have explained this phenomenon to me. Crypto has the potential to save us from the money/debt crunch that will be coming with all fractional backing systems. Hopefully we won't mess it up first by being greedy. I can't imagine what will happen if both of these currencies fail us.

That is true on the short term but that is because they all keep faith, if Bitcoin isn't accepted for anything in the future you'll be stuck with them. This is why I feel the need for a large entity to guarantee a Bitcoin to gold price to at least give the market a starting point for stability. I'm holding now as well, but hoarding will even fundamentally slowdown the introduction of new crypto into the economy, further stagnating it.

Nothing matters, ever. What's your point? This is a sub Reddit to discuss Bitcoin, I have put my two cents in. And this is a bubble right until the moment that there is something besides hot air expanding it.

And THAT totally isn't a bubble

I've noticed over and over and over again throughout the years, that when new promising stock becomes available, it is traded heavily, it's known as the bubble(a time when the new interest brings the market price above value). However when these new stocks are traded and have no actual tangible value backing the stock up, it collapses hard. Like with the housing bubble and like with the tulip bubble. But Nicholas, you retort; "Bitcoin was designed to operate without intrinsic value using the blockchain." This holds true, however almost NOBODY is using this new technology as currency like it is supposed to be utilized. This means we are all sitting on a stock with no point from which to state it's value. Because no one buys things with Bitcoin in mass, the price also is by the same stroke, hugely erratic with how the market swings. If we keep the course one day the swing will be so violent that everybody losses everything (in a nut shell). If a government were to say that no matter the market value, they would trade x amount of Bitcoin for x amount of gold (gold is just a standing example) this would set a point off of which BTC can stabilize and ride along with the market. But as it now stands, to buy anything substantial, the entire blockchain has to hold the value steady for one purchase! Can't be done. 
TLRD: Bitcoin is not a stock and if you treat it like one you'll get burned hard along with this new amazing idea for currency.

They'll be doing better if they don't have a bunch of money that can't buy anything and people won't give you real money for.

Entirely true. Right now the market isn't set up for purchasing, which is awful and will kill Bitcoin if left to fester. The best move for us little guys right now is to hold and wait for things to make more sense. However the fact that no one, with the graviras to stabilize the currency, jumping in to help. It will probably get stable and then erratic again and then swing to collapse.

I see what you're getting at however, holding is a necessary evil, but it can't even a universal move less the economy stagnate. You must think of the market in terms of holders and people who hold out to buy at the right price, we are trending towards all holders holding and all prospective buyers holding as well. That can only go for a bit before it causes a crash. Holding a currency that no one is spending reliabily is exactly how a bubble forms. This isnt new, this is what happened in almost all hard crashes throughout history. HOWEVER in the short term cases like with day trading, it's perfect. But given the current infrastructure issues with everything it's clear to me that we're on a fulcrom that could either blow up or...blow up in our faces.
