What makes you think it's a scam coin?
It allows you to move in and out of Bitcoin, Gold, Silver, USD etc on a decentralised exchange. There are gateways being setup for instant conversions like metaexchange.info.
Apparently other popular altcoins are getting added soon too like Litecoin, Doge, Dark etc.

What we need is graphical colours/sizes for different denominations with entirely different names. I'm not an artist but yeah something like this: 
The different divisions could become different named coins all together so if you have say 1.132 Bitcoins you could also call that 1 Bitcoin, 100 blahs, 30 blahblahs and 2 whatsits.
EDIT: Of course the naming conventions would have to be linked in some way but different enough that people would be happy to invest in some blahs and not just full Bitcoins

such a bizarre place to put the limit!
Wish they used Bitstamp instead of Gox as well

I always used one of my "junk" passwords for bitcoin talk anyway... A site without https that wants passwords? No thank you.

Do not be tempted to sell using paypal, there is a very high rate of fraud.
How many coins do you have? Is the large quantity the problem?
The problem with paypal is charge backs. I once sold some bitcoins on ebay with paypal but got shafted by a recall.
@_date: 2013-07-13 13:42:04
Have you had any success with this yet? Great stuff :)
@_date: 2013-06-02 08:44:55
Already bouncing back!
@_date: 2013-10-22 15:44:44
I agree with this. This feels like something much larger brewing. As far as I'm concerned, I see Bitcoin being worth thousands one day (or absolutely nothing) so I'm in for the long ride. In saying that, I tend to sell about half my holdings during a bubble and buy back in but timing is very difficult. Personally I think it is still too early.
@_date: 2013-10-25 22:27:33
I'm sure many will be trying!
@_date: 2013-06-16 18:30:56
Depends on whether you're trying to buy anonymously with cash or by other means. Quantities are also important.
I can sell 100-200BTC a week for cash in London.
@_date: 2013-10-28 17:07:20
I like the work you have done with vault of satoshi and am all for having a choice of exchange.
Please could you point me to more information on your wire transfer fees? What are your rates for converting GBP to USD etc.
I think you need to do something to differentiate more from your competitors. BTC China are allowing people to trade for 0% fee for instance. Why not charge a flat fee in the future but keep everything free to begin with as an incentive. This will encourage people to sign up and increase liquidity on the exchange.
Provide us with some more information about your relationship with your bank. Are you currently 100% regulator compliant? Do you expect to have any future difficulties with this? What protection do you offer to users from theft/hacks? Cold storage wallets, employee theft prevention etc. How are your international withdrawals handled?
You should have this information clearly outlined on your about page.
Wishing you the best of luck with your fantastic new endeavour :)

They're support is pretty good - drop them an email and include the transaction id! I've used lb for ages and their reputation is far more important than 17btc
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:06:10
Couldn't agree with this any more... My pretty technophobic parents/friends have me storing their bitcoins for them because they don't have a clue
@_date: 2013-06-02 08:46:13
That explains the monstrous wall getting wiped out!
@_date: 2013-04-05 07:00:31
Every transaction ever made is stored on the blockchain. Some say that because satoshi dice accounts for a huge number of micotransactions, it is one of the causes of more transactions plumping the blockchain.
This is however not entirely accurate as the network should be more than able to accommodate this, especially considering there are transaction fees.

I find this very exciting as it will allow for a much easier implementation of a bitcoin project I'm workibg on! :)

Market cap is total bitcoins in circulation X price
@_date: 2013-10-20 16:35:58
Bitstamp is ran by somebody in the UK (just not based in the UK). There have been several attempts at UK based exchanges but they all have fallen apart due to our stricter banking regulations. Basically, our banks just keep shutting down the accounts.
EDIT: FYI I'm from the UK but still use BitStamp. They provide really good exchange rates from £ to $ so it actually works out fine if you're buying £1000+ (watch out for the wire transfer fees from your bank though)
@_date: 2013-09-18 01:11:48
What is going on?
This guy has been paying huge transaction fees all day take a look: 
Perhaps he's doing this like a santa clause to the Bitcoin mining community :\
@_date: 2013-06-22 20:27:33
Use localbitcoins or bit bargain for quick and easy coins. Alternatively with mtgox the cheapest way to credit account is to send gbp wired to their Japan account. If you're putting in £500+ then the fees aren't too bad. Any less then prob not worth it
@_date: 2013-07-12 23:45:45
Taking a look at Bitstamp it seems pretty good thanks!
On their withdrawal page it says "You always have to insert U.S. dollar amount you wish to withdraw. This amount will be converted to the selected currency, free of charge." So they will convert to GBP free of charge - do you have any idea at what rate this is/where it is obtained from?
@_date: 2013-10-26 10:30:27
It is worth noting that if the FBI does decide to liquidate the coins it is EXTREMELY unlikely that it will be done through a public exchange such as bitstamp or mtgox. What will most likely occur is a private sale to a large individual investors.

This video is really good but not quite there.
some parts are a bit too overdramatic.
I was disappointed that bitcoins divisibility was not covered as this is one of the key concerns I receive when explaining bitcoin

Haha interesting study - bitcoin wealth assuming we all become bitcoin millionaires?

@_date: 2013-10-25 22:45:59
Very cool nice work! 
The confirmations are optional and just help when establishing trust between strangers
In the future this wont be a problem as companies will underwrite the "risk" and take the transaction as is.
Think of it as visa and MasterCard today - our payment is instant but no money actually goes anywhere until it has been processed/cleared by the company.
@_date: 2013-09-10 08:22:48
Another old goxer reporting in. I moved to bitstamp and am very happy with them so far. Their customer service is fantastic 
@_date: 2013-05-20 21:53:26
Paypal refund is unlikely as you are shipping a physical good.
Make sure that you have recorded delivery and hold onto your tracking reference. Even if a dispute is raised, you have your shipping reference.

For those who are overwhelmed with the frenzy I can help, simply send over your holdings to me and all your worries will go away :D

Just sent some coins over to the exchange right before it went down...
@_date: 2013-04-06 22:58:47
Competing currencies form an interesting purpose as a sort of backup. Well that's the argument anyway. I personally feel that they are started and only getting jumped on by those who wish that they had been early adopters of bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-07-13 13:42:32
True - but still probably worth it on a big bill!
@_date: 2013-10-22 16:01:20
You can always say that with bitcoin though - I remember buying in at $10 in 2011, they went up to $20 and everyone was saying this!
@_date: 2013-05-26 11:15:56
I don't know why this is getting downvotes - it's a cool idea
@_date: 2013-05-22 20:46:14
but what if you want to hold fiat ready to buy after price swings.
Takes 2-5days to fund my acc so can miss opportunities otherwise :\
@_date: 2013-10-19 22:40:12
You should invest if you are prepared to lose everything or wait a long time for returns. Bitcoin is fantastic but it is also very high risk. 
Personally I am very bullish long term so don't mind the swings and am enjoying the ride! 
I've heard this quote before but I stand by it. "Bitcoin will either be worth thousands or absolutely nothing. There isn't really anything in between"
@_date: 2013-06-02 00:47:11
agreed - great product really want one! Would love the opportunity to invest in the company. Hope they do a BTC IPO!

certainly with that attitude!
@_date: 2013-07-22 07:36:25
When.buying first tine it's probably easiest to grab some from localbitcoins.com. Alternatively set yourself up on an exchange - mtgox and bitstamp have the most volume
@_date: 2013-07-23 00:49:24
Their* on phone...
@_date: 2013-07-28 15:40:09
Haha I'm still hoping that it may happen! I'm staying mostly fiat until a sustained level above $100
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:18:10
I think they've made some changes probably nothing to worry about, just make sure you haven't been redirected and aren't getting phished.
Coins still not in my account. How about yours?
Edit: 27 confirmations and still no funds wtf mtgox!
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:13:34
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2013-09-11 11:04:36
We should all be wary when leaving bitcoins/cash in any system as it's impossible to say what could happen. Having said that I do regularly leave cash in my exchange account for day trading/arbitrage. One of the benefits of Bitstamp over other exchanges is the requirement for email confirmation of any Bitcoin withdrawals
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:03:59
Sounds legit
@_date: 2013-10-28 17:32:39
Awesome! Blockchain wallet really takes the complexity out of Bitcoin for new users whilst still maintaining a high level of security. Hell I got my mother set up on Bitcoin using blockchain!
@_date: 2013-02-17 16:38:58
Yeah I'm keeping a close eye on this, we had a similar correction on the 14th but it bounced back very strong. This one will probably do the same. We still have a 40,000 BTC buffer before the price drops below $20.
@_date: 2013-10-28 21:59:21
So it can - I was still on a really old version so just updated! Thanks
@_date: 2013-07-28 15:37:10
Quite possibly - but if we can sustain a breach of $100 for a few days then we may see a bit of a bull run
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:48:58
This is a substantial amount of BTC so I would put every effort you can into recovering them and make sure you are incredibly careful!
Good luck russianpotato, I'm booking marking this thread and hoping you will update us with your progress!
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:31:31
Here to buy actually
@_date: 2013-10-22 15:50:24
Agreed - I'm still super bullish on this run up.
@_date: 2013-10-25 22:50:44
The correction at the moment is incredibly healthy in market activity. I did not sell but will be buying more :)
@_date: 2013-10-18 14:35:27
Their site is still online - perhaps they had a security breach and their server source was wiped. Hopefully they have lots of backups and will be able to restore
