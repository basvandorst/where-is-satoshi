One day, anyday, bitcoin will have a supply chokepoint where demand far exceeds supply. At these prices a lot of redistribution of the bitcoins is probably occurring. Those bought coins will probably sit in cold storage for a long time while the rest of the world will be transacting the dust.

Enter the classroom and say: by a show of hands who can explain to me how TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP, and VoIP work? Well, you may not know exactly how each protocol works, but I can guarantee you that each of you uses them everyday. Whether you browse the Internet, send email or text, or Google chat, you are utilizing a protocol. Now imagine a protocol designed to send and receive money anywhere in the world for a fractional cost without ever having to step inside a bank or a Western Union. And this is just one application of this protocol. 
It is called the blockchain. It is a decentralized, peer to peer network that secures, records and verifies every transaction from the currency known as bitcoin as well as potentially contracts, legal agreements, escrows and more. Computer networks operated by people known as miners around the world work 24/7 performing this sole function by solving complex cryptographic algorithms. Those who spend money on the computer hardware to perform this function are in turn rewarded with bitcoin which they can hold or sell, thus creating nominal value for both the blockchain and bitcoin, the digital currency.
Right now, the world including governments, banks, regulators, and such are trying to determine what it is as well as what impact it will have on our future. Some call it digital money, gold 2.0, and others a scam. Whatever you believe it to be or think it is, Bitcoin as a blockchain and bitcoin as a currency are an astounding innovation and achievement in the world of computer science and finance. Like email and the Internet, maybe one day you'll be using it and not even think twice about how it works.

This has been in the works since 2012. WalMart didn't want to be beholden to the banks and credit cards - especially with the call for EMV/NFC PoS terminals to be rolled out next year for nearly $300-$500 each. Apparently they (a consortium of large brand name franchises including CVS, 7-11, Dunkin Donut) didn't want to be controlled and held hostage by ApplePay's self enclosed ecosystem. Just look at the price the banks are paying who are virtually subsiding the system's fees.
These franchises have set up a consortium called Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX) and will be working with a cloud based provider called Paydiant to store customer financial information. To secure the data transaction, they'll use these Currentc tokens between the Pos to the cloud. To incentivize customers, these stores will offer discounts and rewards for using the system which would also eliminate the credit card fees. 
Some wild guess takeaways:
1. Our economy as we know it is entering a full digital age and all the heavy weights are on the playing field and quickly taking sides for our money. 
2. Cyber security for cloud based platforms will be big business.
3. These battles for the consumer will rapidly increase the everyday consumer's knowledge of digital wallets, but trusting those systems will take time. Good for bitcoin.
4. Bitcoin has an advantage of having multiple cross application - remittances, micro-payments, lending, derivatives, store of value, currency. PoS and e-commerce represent just a slice of where bitcoin can prove to be useful. 
Bottom line: this is all a part of Bitcoin's hurdle rate - likewise for ApplePay and MCX. The consumer will need to trust and adopt it. This is new territory. Bitcoin can coexist in this world of NFC, EMV chips, Currentc tokens if not supersede or hedge against them given its broad use application and unique properties.

This is a difficult question to tackle and I would defer to others who can offer a better breakdown. There is absolutely no question a great number of transactions for bitcoin occur  (which as far I know cannot be verified) off the blockchain via Bitpay, Coinbase, Bitcoin Investment Trust, and brokers. While controversial, they are providing a "necessary" and arguably essential service by proving liquidity to the market. If they did not, given the volume and transaction size they either process or require to conduct business for clients/customers then bitcoin's volatility would even be more out of sync and result in prolonged transaction times. Coinsafe has developed a possible solution though but it might be more applicable for micro payments (a tip, buying bread, etc.) 
My short take is that off block transactions are going to be part of bitcoin's set up for the foreseeable future whether one agrees or disagrees with it. I'm not endorsing or defending it, just trying to describe it from a macro perspective. It maintains market flow. There is also an economy of scale to be considered that is being developed around bitcoin and it's introducing a wide variety of financial tools to traders including derivatives to hedge risk and more recently currency swaps to protect counterparty risk. I would assume that off block transactions belong in this category.
As much as everyone would love to see bitcoin multiply 10x tomorrow, big market players are proactively seeking ways to avoid causing violent volatility swings. Even with the volatility, experienced traders are still able to profit using margin to short or go long. Bitcoin is growing up and becoming more sophisticated. Personally, I believe this is what actually makes bitcoin more attractive as an underlying asset for the financial community. Just as Silicon Valley and other programmers/developers see the opportunity so do the young traders disillusioned by Wall St. (the shills aside).
Anyone feel free to pick this apart to derive a better perspective.

I agree with your points here. I would add this: think like a VC and/or entrepreneur when viewing Bitcoin. For us (small investors), we follow news, tweets, look for updates/analysis in search of the next price catalyst (i.e. GABI, Overstock, Lawsky's reg, Winkelvoss ETF), sub posts, trendlines - anything to indicate a possible shift upward. I know we don't have the luxury of sitting comfortably like the VCs, but some of these guys are heavily invested and heavily bullish and representing the interests of clients' of high net worth. Their time horizon for bitcoin to appreciate and mature might be just slightly longer than our own. Just a few of my bits worth.

While ECDSA is indeed not secure under quantum computing, quantum computers don't yet exist and probably won't for a while. The DWAVE system often written about in the press is, even if all their claims are true, not a quantum computer of a kind that could be used for cryptography. 
Bitcoin's security, when used properly with a new address on each transaction, depends on more than just ECDSA: Cryptographic hashes are much stronger than ECDSA under QC. Bitcoin's security was designed to be upgraded in a forward compatible way and could be upgraded if this were considered an imminent threat.
See the implications of quantum computers on public key cryptography here 
The risk of quantum computers is also there for financial institutions, like banks, because they heavily rely on cryptography when doing transactions.

OP your points are valid and echo this reporter's experience cited last year 
There are many great use cases for bitcoin right now, and others can mention those particularly when we see OpenBazaar.
I'm not going to try to speak for all enthusiasts, but I consider myself an investor in bitcoin first and foremost. While this may sound contradictory in supporting bitcoin, bitcoin is still very young. Larger investors will need to support bitcoin to grow it's monetary base for it to function like a currency. It needs greater liquidity. In my view, bitcoin is more like a volatile commodity. If you expect it will have greater future value, then you also believe it will increase your future purchasing power. This is speculative conjecture, not advice. 
Above everything else, keep on educating people about bitcoin. Anyone will tell you it takes time. I read somewhere that new technologies need nearly 5 touches - where you hear about it from a friend, read about or see it in use - before a person becomes convinced and embraces it. It's the network effect. Braintree's bitcoin payment system should help facilitate that user awareness.

Good post. I like how the audience is young and asking these questions. India's Bank Governor sounds like a pragmatist: Bitcoin is not yet ready for taking over the entire world on a full scale, but in 10-20 years the world will be a cashless society, and very likely operating in virtual currency. 
His point about bitcoin's security is a bit off the mark, but the perception fears of securing bitcoin after Mt. Gox lingers. Mt. Gox was a very expensive lesson. Bitcoin will have to fully mature and stabilize its volatility before a country like India backs it, but more desperate countries with weaker currencies might not wait.

EMV encrypted chip will certainly be an upgrade to the magnetic stripe card, however the cost to businesses for EMV migration and the complexity of migration will be major barriers to widespread adoption. Installing new or upgrading existing terminals and POS systems will be expensive - which explains why the U.S. is several years behind the rest of the world in adoption of the technology. What most businesses may not know is that EMV certification is also a continuous process that must be completed every three years. The knowledge and capacity needed to manage and maintain this process is something most businesses are not able to support for the long term. Your point is well taken, but like everything else it's not given as you imply.

WalMart didn't want to be beholden to the banks and credit cards - especially with the call for EMV/NFC PoS terminals to be rolled out next year for nearly $300-$500 each (as the article also point out). Apparently they (a consortium of large brand name franchises including CVS, 7-11, Dunkin Donut) didn't want to be controlled and held hostage by ApplePay's self enclosed ecosystem. Just look at the price the banks are paying who are virtually subsiding the system's fees.
These franchises have set up a consortium called Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX) and will be working with a cloud based provider called Paydiant to store customer financial information. To secure the data transaction, they'll use these Currentc tokens between the Pos to the cloud. To incentivize customers, these stores will offer discounts and rewards for using the system which would also eliminate the credit card fees.
Some wild guess takeaways: 1. Our economy as we know it is entering a full digital age and all the heavy weights are on the playing field and quickly taking sides for our money. 2. Cyber security for cloud based platforms will be big business. 3. These battles for the consumer will rapidly increase the everyday consumer's knowledge of digital wallets, but trusting those systems will take time. Good for bitcoin. 4. Bitcoin has an advantage of having multiple cross application - remittances, micro-payments, lending, derivatives, store of value, currency. PoS and e-commerce represent just a slice of where bitcoin can prove to be useful.
Bottom line: this is all a part of Bitcoin's hurdle rate - likewise for ApplePay and MCX. The consumer will need to trust and adopt it. This is new territory. Bitcoin can coexist in this world of NFC, EMV chips, Currentc tokens if not supersede or hedge against them given its broad use application and unique properties.

Securer is both an adjective and noun. 
I'm not qualified to comment on the future of transaction fees. I will guess that it is probably more of technical complexity and an unknown than you lay out in three lines. My best guess is that market dynamics &amp; participants will find an equilibrium point still better than current costs.
Regardless of what I or anyone else says, it appears you have already made your final verdict on bitcoin in general.

Nice, insightful piece. It certainly brings value to the discussion on this sub. I'll offer a few observations.
First, I agree it's make sense for Wall St. to wait it out until the market cap is substantial enough for them to participate. However,  they don't have to be direct participants as you suggest. The Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), Pantera Capital and others are providing their services as a third party to invest in bitcoin on behalf of portfolio managers, private equity and family offices. This is an indirect way for them to participate without incurring overexposure to risk or discrediting their reputation among their peers. In fact, Fortress Investment Group was pivotal in forming Pantera for this very reason. Pantera and BIT are just bridges with the capacity to invest in bitcoin and start ups. 
Second, Vaurum and other HFT platforms which are designed specifically for larger institutions to participate are being rolled out. The older Wall St. establishment may not be immediately enticed by bitcoin, but I am sure some younger and ambitious ones might be for the very reasons you outlined. We might see a gradual exodus at some point. 
Bottom line - it's going to take time; and it won't be just one driver but many working simultaneously to make the ecosystem flourish.

It's called basic marketing 101. You have every right to question and scrutinize the accuracy/method of arriving at the number, but the bottom line is that most people are not like you - they don't care. The 2 million mark signifies, at the very least, greater awareness and interest among the mainstream - especially if you take in account Google trends over same period. Blockchain's announcement also draws new interest for the public. This is the first step toward greater adoption. Supplemented by new accounts generated and announced by Coinbase and later Circle, it demonstrates there is lot of activity within the young ecosystem.

The VCs have their big bets on the companies because that is how they payout their investors. Whether those companies like Coinbase one day go public as an IPO or get bought out years from now. They are all chasing unicorns (100x returns/$1B private evaluation or exit). How that relates to bitcoin the currency makes for interesting times. One thing this year has shown, the VCs and their backed companies are 6-12 months ahead all of us. They are making news today that we all see tomorrow. For all we know, the heavy money is quietly buying and accumulating on and off the chain at these suppressed prices.

A year after the Goldman conference, the firm invested in Circle Internet Financial, a startup that sells and stores bitcoins for consumers, and the Nasdaq disclosed a pilot test of the Bitcoin blockchain for trading securities.
My take from the article is that big banks and financial institutions like Goldman are now more willing to hedge their bets in case they are all wrong about bitcoin - hence their small investment stake in Circle. Financial institutions might be ideologically resistant to a system like bitcoin but they cannot be indifferent to it too. Bitcoin has the potential to self propagate and saturate our entire global economy given its diversity of use cases and applications.

The general public in the U.S. is clueless about bitcoin. It will take more than headlines and tv episodes for more people to take a serious interest in it.

The first domino. Hernando de Soto Polar, an eminent Peruvian scholar, has written extensively on the amount of capital in untitled assets held by the world’s poor. By his estimates, it reaches to almost $10 trillion. Registering property in the world's developing countries can be a key driver for people to access wealth. Just as the article points out: "This also gives owners of the nearly 60 percent of undocumented land, an incentive to register their property officially."

The great thing about the big Bitcoin is that it has potential use cases beyond currency. Bitcoin can pivot. 
If Facebook can succeed where Google failed, then it obviously will be path breaking. But it won't happen overnight and just as the article points out, FB will face the same hurdles as bitcoin - people trusting it. One significant drawback will be securing their own platform which would vulnerable to a single point of attack. That's a huge risk. The advantage it has though is a huge base. Those VCs are going to make money either way.

This chicken egg problem goes back to the roots of bitcoin: speculation. Speculation and price discovery are necessary for building up the market cap size. In the same way increasing the block to 20mb can handle more transactions, bitcoin with a larger market cap handles more market participants. You just can't write that into code though. As the Bitcoin ecosystem matures from the start-up side, maybe that speculative cycle will catch up and on again.

Even well backed start ups like Bitpay have a burn rate. They probably ran through a lot cash during their overseas expansion. Not to long ago they made a strategic pivot from the small merchant class to the enterprise level. Other Bitcoin companies too are going to have to find ways to generate more revenue at some point in light of the slow consumer demand.
Bitcoin the currency is taking a back seat to blockchain technology as far as can be gleaned from recent funding rounds and the press. Despite resistance from some to defend the two as inseparable, the big financial institutions don't care. They've placed their bets on companies like Chain.
Bitcoin could become the backbone of settlements between banks and companies and/or an invisible payment rail where people have no idea they are actually transacting in Bitcoin. All said, Bitcoin as a currency in its current state is far too exotic and cumbersome a vehicle for the casual consumer to use.
How this plays out is why we are here.

One of the most understated factors lending to bitcoin's success is time. And the fact the protocol is decentralized. The two combined make bitcoin a force to be reckoned with. With each passing day the network is becoming more entrenched (hashing/mining, and transactions perspective). Tack in increased scalability and reduced supply in time, bitcoin should look a lot different a year or so from now. It's an open playing field that any enterprising entrepreneur  (preferably back by a VC) can enter the space and compete from any country. The analogy commonly used is Linux. Whatever shape or form bitcoin takes in the near and long term future, it is a foregone conclusion that bitcoin has already changed the game. Unless you actively work in the space, we just and wait see how this amazing gift of technology will develop and unfold. To the moon.

Price matters in terms of scaling up, security of the network and overall liquidity in the market. The VCs, entrepreneurs and developers know this. It's absurd to even suggest that they can somehow collaborate together to jack up the price to achieve those objectives though. They are building the infrastructure and creating the trading tools for institutional, professional traders to help make that happen. Who really knows how long that will take - 2 days, 2 weeks, 2 months, 2 years? I doubt anyone knows when the next bull run will be. If the price goes up and a number of quality products and services are available to support the ecosystem, then look out.
