Check out Verify.as (CRED) which will work with BTC and many/any other currency.  It specifically addresses the concerns here, in what I feel is the proper way.  This type of thing must have dispute resolution and more, and a protocol like Verify is far better suited as another layer.

So what?  It still uses waaaay too much.  Especially when we have dPOS options that are proving to be more secure and use an absolute fraction of the energy of Bitcoin.

Sorry it read contradictory.

To think that USD will last forever is naive.

It has nothing to do with confirming transactions.  People can use a block explorer for that, and most people don’t know the particulars of how confirmations even work, or care, frankly.
You’re asking for the impossible.  People want to trade in and out of fiat with confidence that there is solid liquidity when they’re doing so.  Come up with a solution to that and Coinbase’s relevance can be diminished.  Until then you just sound like you’re on a personal moral tirade.

Nothing you’ve said is wrong.  However, what you desire, rightfully so, will absolutely never happen with the rest of the human race.  But keep preaching brotha!
@_date: 2019-03-02 16:38:39
It becomes far less of a concern when there is a fully decentralized network.  I’m not saying liquidity importance fades, it doesn’t at all.  But when the network isn’t controlled by a company or government, if designed properly, it’s a far more optimal situation.
But, Bitcoin has nothing to do with this, nor was that the premise of this discussion.  It was based around Coinbase’s dominance over liquidity in BTC markets.
@_date: 2019-03-02 16:39:33
Ya.  Preferably a decentralized one.
@_date: 2019-03-02 15:16:46
There will always be a largest liquidity market.  Maybe you can have a duopoly or even an oligopoly, but the market tends to flock to the one with the best liquidity which then has a compounding effect over time.
So long as fiat is still crucial in most of our lives, I don’t see this going away.

Nano is run on a block lattice, similar to git, the popular code repository technology used to develop most of the software in the world.

What makes it a proof of concept and POW so proven?  This is all new tech.  We’re talking about a few years difference.  But, if that’s your argument and somehow a few years difference makes one proven and another a concept, so be it.

Not necessarily.  In that case it just equates to more centralization as each miner is a larger part of the overall hash rate.

And yet it’s still no where near the best option for instant, fee-less, and environmentally friendly transactions.
@_date: 2018-06-07 22:06:20
POS doesn't have mining.  So, you're welcome to classify it as "100% premine" if that makes you feel better about it.  But, by that definition, it'd have to be a chain that's mined and Nano is a block lattice (a DAG, like git or IOTA) that's DPOS.  The distribution was not only for South American countries.  It's just that they chose to take advantage of it.

Don’t confuse the lack of being an advanced capitalist economy with decentralization.  That’s not the right term to be used here.  China absolutely has many more small mom and pop shops and independent contractors.  That’s great.  America probably has the least.  This is the result of advanced capitalism.  I don’t particularly love it, but it is what it is.  Let’s not toss the term, “decentralization” into this though, bc the term doesn’t make sense in context.
China is built on the collective mentality without much care for individual freedoms.  Much of the West is built on the premise that individual freedoms will not be infringed upon.  The result of these two ideologies can be seen through the manifestations today.
Personally, I like the central tenets of both ideologies at the core.  However, when scaled and applied to large populations controlled by highly centralized governments, all while trying to apply principals to micro-communities in unison, the result is often ugly.  In my opinion, this tends to manifest in a more dramatic and negative fashion within the collective mentality China employs.

Increased hashrate is required to maintain its security model.  It will only continue to increase as long as Bitcoin is still desired.
We live in a world with serious concern for our planetary resources.  Yet, we’re over here sucking massive amounts of power to feed this security model.
@_date: 2019-08-10 08:03:57
We is the global society of humans.  You can choose to like PoS as a means of security or not, that's your choice.  But, we, as humans, have some great PoS options.  I for one, sleep well at night knowing I don't support the wastefulness of massive amounts of precious resources.

Thank you for a properly written title, instead of saying they can attack all other crypto currencies.  It’s important to point out these are merely SHA256 optimized miners.
@_date: 2018-06-07 21:45:10
You make the improper assumption that POW is the only means of securing a public ledger.
Regarding decentralization and security, you're 100% correct.  Here is some actual data on that topic, instead of talk.
As far as speed is concerned, Bitcoin performs very poorly, and the LN is a really bad solution; one that almost entirely defeats the purpose sought in the first place.
@_date: 2019-08-11 07:34:26
The LN is insanely complex and riddled with issues.  Can they be overcome... maybe.  But it's still a pretty nasty solution with watchtowers, opening/closing channels, etc.  I'm good with Bitcoin being digital gold.  There are better crypto currencies for daily transacting.
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:57:35
Totally a shitcoin, you're right.... I mean, who needs eco friendly, instant and free P2P transactions on-chain... No one... We need expensive and slow ones on side-chains that use more electricity than entire countries!

Truth.  Luckily we also have some great PoS options too.
@_date: 2019-02-23 05:01:02
That’s fine, but the mining is broken too.  The amount of wasted energy is silly.  I much prefer Nano’s approach with DPOS consensus and POW for spam prevention.
@_date: 2019-02-22 21:09:39
Oh, I get why.  All because the main blockchain network design is obtuse.
@_date: 2019-02-23 22:39:25
LOL.  Amazon gets to set their own minimum.  It’s to block people from sending you tons of .00000001 NANO transactions.  You can set your minimum on your wallet since you’re the one that “pockets” a payment.  You can choose to pocket the ones less than your threshold at a later date as well, if you like.
No, it’s not the same.  Nano’s POW has nothing to do with consensus.  It’s just a way to prevent spam.
@_date: 2019-02-23 06:26:28
Personally, I have more trust in election/delegation than the ability for people to build mining power and hoping that stays distributed.  If modern society has taught us anything, power always gets concentrated into the hands of a few.  I’d rather not hang my hat on that outcome.
Nano also has some new stuff in the works regarding your POW DoS attack.  Firstly, is the ability to set a minimum transaction amount for accounts, so you can’t spam a single account and prevent them from receiving transactions they intend.
Another is regarding the ability to mass generate PoW.  I don’t recall the specifics of the implementation, but essentially you’ll need the previous receive block to generate the next send block.
There are plenty of free/open protocols that exist today, and there are DoS attacks and prevention mechanisms that continue.  That doesn’t mean we need to implement a fee layer on top of these protocols to solve the DoS attacks.
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:02:43
So bloated and unnecessarily complicated.

I fail to see the difference between distributed consensus that calculated some POW or voted on the authenticity and accuracy of a transaction/account balance here.
How’s POW have a frame of reference?  Where is that node getting it’s starting point?
@_date: 2019-04-14 20:08:29
Not pushing it for starters and I’m very well aware of how it’s designed and works.
POW is used to send a transaction.  That means one POW has to be calculated for every transaction.
With Bitcoin, it’s orders of magnitude more POW per transaction.  It’s used for consensus.
Nano uses POS for consensus via delegation from voting nodes.
Statements like yours are the largest cop out when it comes to a discussion.
@_date: 2019-04-18 03:59:54
Yea, that’s it - beautiful mall too.  It’s obviously appealing to more upscale clients, but I think that’s where we are in terms of adoption.  The masses are sheep.

Regarding the marketcap values - this is such an absurd metric to use.  I even question how much of that “supply” is even known on those forks.  Liquidity is horrible too.  They could basically stay at their marketcap forever with no activity.

@_date: 2019-04-10 04:35:08
A new node is listening on the live p2p network for real vote hashes which are heads of a merkle tree.  These will describe balances for many other accounts.

Nothing is going to happen here without regulation.  The Bitcoin community will also make up any and every stat and excuse to fight this.
“Miners use mostly renewables”
Whoopty shit.  Most everyone will be using “renewables” soon and this doesn’t negate from the fact that this is taking away from the overall power output for society.  When there is an excess of fully renewable and clean power in society, let’s abuse it, but that’ll never happen.
The reality here is that governments will have to step in to do something about it, if we want to.
Another alternative is going with a cryptocurrency that’s actually green and sustainable.  There are quite a few, ones that just so happen to not have most of the other Bitcoin flaws as well.

QR codes can embed the amount so it’s really just a scan and pay.  Check out the Natrium wallet for Nano as well.  It’s extremely seamless.
@_date: 2019-04-10 04:22:27
I’m not familiar with this “nothing at stake problem”.  Nano is DPoS, so there are nodes and delegated stake in those nodes.  In the case of a fork, sure people may run a node on both networks (Nano is a block lattice, not a single blockchain), but what’s the issue?  That doesn’t mean there is free money in both networks.  Also, there is far less reason to fork a network on PoS, especially one like Nano.  Maybe you can outline a bit about this issue.
Subjectivity?  Are you referring to bootstrapping?  Nodes get their blocks by using what’s known as lazy bootstrapping by listening on the network for votes, which are hashes representing multiple account states.  A node can also download a copy of the ledger from a trusted node, which is done off the P2P network.  There are also other optimizations that really speed up the initial bootstrapping process.
@_date: 2019-04-14 20:21:13
People can judge for themselves if the POW is a considerable concern or mention.  Here are some stats.
@_date: 2019-04-10 04:56:09

That article is extremely old now too and a LOT of development has been done on the protocol since then.  Spam is still a top concern with Nano development efforts, and much is being done about it.  But that whole premise is completely flawed today.
@_date: 2019-04-14 20:26:41
Look, the POW isn’t even a concern or worth a mention in comparison to Bitcoin.
Cost per transaction
Nano	0.112 Wh (including POW for spam prevention)
Bitcoin	 406 kWh (currently and as high as 950kWh)

No I’m actually referring to the PoS variants.
@_date: 2019-04-10 00:58:18
I’m pretty sure he means miners getting behind a fork.  A fork which inflates the block reward in the future.  I could see that happening too.  That’s the problem with POW chains.  The interests aren’t wholly aligned like a PoS or DPoS currency.
@_date: 2019-04-10 20:15:06
So decoding the hash for a block gives me every transaction in the block?  And how do I know that the hash I receive hasn’t been tampered with?
@_date: 2019-04-17 00:20:45
Maybe on some chains, but not with block cementing.
Also, you’re not going to buy that much supply.  No one has that much money.  It’s virtually impossible.  It’d be waaaay easier to gain 51% of the mining hashpower than 51% of supply, unless you’re talking about some tiny cap PoS token.
@_date: 2019-04-07 15:20:22
I asked how this would work.  Are we to assume there is an open channel?
@_date: 2019-04-10 13:29:06
Why do you need to compare when it’s a confirmed hash/vote?  That’s like saying you can’t trust a completed/confirmed payment on Nano because you don’t have anything to compare it to.
@_date: 2019-04-07 21:48:46
What makes you so daft to think that the question wasn’t rhetorical?
@_date: 2019-04-07 15:51:07
LN requires an open channel.  Walk me through how’s that work if I don’t even know what a channel is.

Here is a video explaining payment channels.  Give it a watch.
@_date: 2019-04-10 15:29:27
Yes and when checking this math, what’s the baseline for confirmation of accuracy?  The previous block?
@_date: 2019-04-14 17:23:08
Something that isn’t Bitcoin isn’t a shitcoin.  I like Bitcoin for what it is, but it will never solve the energy wastefulness.  It was literally designed to use energy as the finite resource which secures the chain.
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:02:45
So you’re going to decode the hash which will give you a list of all the transactions in that block, then you’re going to verify each and every one of them to confirm if that block is valid, replaying this from the genesis block to current?
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:02:31
No, it’s fine.  There are better networks for transacting lots of transactions - instant, fee-less or nearly fee-less, and very little carbon footprints.
There will always be multiple currency options.  Use the one that’s best for you and your use case.
If you need anonymity, maybe you’ll use Monero.  If you need to transact between your IoT devices or pay for a cup of coffee, maybe you’ll use Nano.  If you need to pay for your $10k coffee bean order so it can be shipped internationally to your coffee shop for roasting, maybe you’ll use Bitcoin.
Bitcoin doesn’t need to solve every currency problem.  It just needs to be the most secure and thus, the most valuable.
@_date: 2019-04-07 14:33:29
This is horrible.  Wait until people start taking advantage of this.  The bad PR will be quite damaging.  Lightening is something, although a mess IMO.  How would that have even worked with a lightening transaction?
Personally, I don’t think Bitcoin is the right currency for these types of transactions.  There are far better alternatives.  Ones that’ll get you fully confirmed in under 3 seconds.
@_date: 2019-04-07 17:31:11
Just because you read some Bitcoin maximalist article doesn't make you informed.  You're blindly accepting someone's opinion on what should be done, but why?  Is it because they bought a domain name with bitcoin in the name?  Or because people frequently mention that 0-conf transactions are okay on Bitcoin forums?
If you're buying something small where a complete loss isn't a big deal, sure, take 0-conf and accept that risk.  A laptop purchase is certainly not one of those situations for which I'd be comfortable - a coffee is.
But, I guess you just saying that I'm clueless justifies your sheepish opinion on the topic.
@_date: 2019-04-07 17:19:11
Sorry, I'm at a loss of words.  People seriously have no clue how anything works.  It's just blind stupidity.
You can download a number of apps to send fake bitcoin transactions on mainnet.  It's not really hard.  Until a transaction is confirmed, you truly have no clue if the money is good or not.  I have no idea what you're talking about with hundreds of thousands of spends (I assume dollars).  That literally refers to nothing.  It certainly doesn't refer to the cost of gaining 51% mining control over the Bitcoin network.
0-conf transaction is analogous to taking a check from someone.  If you're good with that and giving something of a certain value, so be it.  But I hope you're getting a lot of personally identifiable information as well so you can go after them if the transaction doesn't confirm.  But that's going to really slow down the check-out time.  Anyone who's had to wait behind someone writing a check and the cashier writing down their ID, etc. will know the pain there.
@_date: 2019-04-10 16:34:37
So you’re going to only check the POW trust consensus from other trusted nodes to base your math?
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:08:08

Why can't a PoS node validate all blocks in the same fashion to verify the chain?
@_date: 2019-04-10 02:01:04
Risk?  What are you talking about?  I’m not even following what you’re trying to get at here.
As for catching up on the chain for new nodes, Nano already has a solution for this.  But even before that, there isn’t any downloading from a centralized party.
I think your understanding on PoS is probably a couple years dated at this point.
@_date: 2019-04-14 19:45:30
It does use it for spam and that could end up contributing to more energy consumption than preferred.
But that statement couldn’t be more factually incorrect.  One computer produces the POW for a transaction.  It’s not used for distributed consensus.
@_date: 2019-04-14 20:49:04
Of course you are.  Bitcoin uses 3.625 Million times more power than Nano for every transaction.

@_date: 2019-09-06 11:50:02
Yea, that's not really currently accurate.  I'm not aware of a lot that make the "claim".  You actually use the word "claim" when all it takes is a little research to verify.  Everything is a "claim", according to your definition here.
Regardless, there are a few that are centralized.  Most aren't "currencies".  There is really only one that checks all the boxes, including being bossless.  In fact, less bossless than Bitcoin.
