I'll hold onto your excess so you can use your account again. :3
(I didn't catch the crypto trading quick enough so I only have .08 of a bitcoin. Meanwhile my brother left me in the dust and has over 1 with almost 10k in usd value to my measly .6k. It's not fair and I demand a hand out!)

I got it working. 2 dollars a day. I'll be rich in no time.

That's the one I got. Hard as shit. Videos, written tutorials. Didn't help at all. Everyone talks about the things they're doing, like you're supposed to already know what it all means. Tossing abbreviations and lingo around like confetti.

I was using one of those z miners that were built off of nice hash. The OG program looks much easier from my first glance at it right now as it's automatically setting up on my computer. It's seems stuck at 32% though. I also just got the bitcoin wallet app, but I can't do anything with nice hash including entering my btc adress while it's setting up. It just gives that DING noise like when an important system window comes up and won't let you do anything until you click it off. Ya know?

I'm trying to get into mining hush, or any currency for that matter. It's hard as shit! I got my wallet, and my mining program, but it won't fucking run. Someone should make a mining wizard that you download and it automatically sets up a wallet and miner for you, and gives you a nice panel of options like work intensity, temperature threshold, auto stopping when it's not profitable, etc. but no, you have to go through every individual step, and it's fucking impossible.

setting it up now, hopefully it is that easy. Says it's getting miners ready. It's seems kinda stuck on 32% on my gpu.
