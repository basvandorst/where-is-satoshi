Every country matters if btc is a global currency. Despite that, the more brazilians engage more robust btc gets in latin america. Lets keep pushing.

There is always an option... we can ask for seashells, salt or fiat! But if BTC is declated illegal we for sure will know in what regime we got ourselves into!!!

Visa was great when we first start using. But we have to grow as a community in all fronts, don't we? They are waiting our requests and yours too ��. Keep charging!

They just published some news on facebook (  ). Although denying a hacker attack, the promise is to get back only in march 14th. Even if the data is preserved, this is outrageous. Lets hope they have an insurance policy. Not a single limitation of liability is able to protect them in Brazil. The small letters here simply does not work against users. With such troublesome communication however it is hard to believe these guys. Possibly a lot of people could be seriously damaged.

I will dance it in your face your miserable dork (pacifism post) cheers mate!

You tell me. 12h for an announcement in Facebook saying they had some maintenance problem and then simply quite for the last 24h. Everyone knows these guys hold millions and ask high fees to just remain quiet. Or this is a scam or a major disrespect with all brazilian users. Would you wait to ask help from the community for some info?

Could you explain more? Why copay is not listed as a safe wallet? And why they are telling us to adopt Electrum wallet for example?
