Well I am quite aware of that. I was merely pointing out that the usage pattern PivotTrade advocated would reduce Bitcoin to "just that".

I just want to clarify that I was not saying that **I** believe that Bitcoin is just a cheaper version of paypal. 
Since I am being misunderstood I guess I must concede that I am not expressing myself clearly.
My statement was a comment to "Pivottrade", who blamed the merchant for being stupid because he held onto bitcoin and suggested that any smart merchant would immediately convert to Fiat. 
I actually agree that merchants shouldn't speculate in Bitcoin unless they want to be investors instead of merchants. But that leaves the point then that I was making: In this particular scenario, Bitcoin is **only** used as a low cost money transfer option and if Paypal or any other similar service could transfer the money faster, cheaper or more secure, he would be smarter choosing that service.
That does obviously not make Bitcoin=Paypal, and there are many other scenarios where this comparison doesn't make sense. But in the scenario that Pivottrade called the merchant out for being **stupid** in, this comparison is correct and in fact he may be better off using paypal.

You are completely missing my point so I will stop trying to explain it to you.

Geez man. No of course that isn't my point and that is not what I said.

I thought the point of an ATM was that you got money out of it. Isn't this more like: Here's a computer you can borrow to do your online bitcoin transactions.

It's very rare that I use a standard ATM, but when I do it's because I want to buy a hotdog and the street vendor doesn't accept Visa. 

With this I have to wait at least 24 hours for my hotdog?

So then Bitcoin is just a cheaper version of Paypal? 
Fiat in, Fiat out - it's only a matter of finding minimal transaction fees for the transfer.
