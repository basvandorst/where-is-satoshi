Keep it coming guys, I haven't really researched anything regarding bitcoin for business. So all the links are incredibly helpful!
Definitely building up a solid case as to why we should use BTC!

How'd you know!

All incredibly interesting! I agree shoehorning this into the county would be terrible. I was just curious if anyone else had any ideas, one I've had after posting this whole thing is perhaps something as small as allowing dog licenses to be paid for via bitcoins. 
It could be a super small way to allow bitcoin to creep into the local government. One small step for and all that jazz.

I've reached out to bitpay to see if they have any solutions regarding b2b. 
My company is very forward thinking so convincing my boss isn't really an issue (we already work via the cloud remotely).
The big issue is figuring out a simple way for our clients to pay us in coins. 
The biggest benefit is that we would save a decent amount of money in wire transfer fees. As a company we would probably convert it back to USD immediately at least at this time, although leaving it sit in BTC could be an interesting strategy in the future.

How do I make a community for San Diego? (I'm new to Reddit).

Solid input! I really like that strategy and our clients are very much used to operating based off of case study results. 
Seems only logical to build a case study involving bitcoin payments.

Exactly what I'm trying to figure out. I contacted bitpay and they said they don't have any support for business to business transactions. It's starting to look like it may not be a real option for b2b.
Does anyone else see this as a serious flaw in the bitcoin system. Without b2b how can it be taken seriously?

Bitcoin won't replace Paypal, but Bitcoin's existence will cause something new.
To me it feels like we are on the brink of having duplicates of every major site on the web with the only difference being that the new site accepts bitcoins.
I've heard about an etsy, a paypal, the list keeps adding up. I think eventually these new sites with old concepts (craigslist that operates on bitcoins instead of USD) will replace their predecessors.

Some of it is interesting, however the small business aspect is really off target for us. Our regular wire transfers are typically a sizable amount of money (probably more than a lot of small businesses would do in a year).

Actually, that wasn't super helpful. The county doesn't really have paid parking lots, far to rural of an area. 
This link was pretty helpful though 
But I'd really love to hear any and all ideas. We've kicked around paying certain county jobs, and he's already thinking about it for his next election (but that's in 4 years). 
Again any constructive ideas are greatly appreciated!

So you're saying use the bitcoin option as leverage to get fee's lowered?

I just decided that Korea isn't a real country.

I'm not sure political affiliation has much to do with it. If businesses can't work with each other via bitcoin, it will not grow nearly as fast. Imagine the potential economy for bitcoin awaiting a b2b system.

Awesome! We've talked about this as well, I'll have a look.
