Nothing definitive but if you’re in any of the Australian Facebook groups there’s been a bunch of conversations about it on almost all of them starting about 24 hours ago

There are groups on Facebook that are for Australians who want to discuss Crypto which have like 20-30 thousand people in them, that’s where I found it about this issue, and that’s where I’ve seen hundreds of people complaining about it. 
I can agree on that, POLi is such a dumb idea

I’m just relaying other people’s anecdotes, but it’s not just a few people, there’s been at least a hundred complaints that I’ve seen on Facebook alone. And it’s not like it’s completely unprecedented, other Australian exchanges have been having troubles with the banks for a few weeks now, Coinspot has closed their AUD deposits because of banking complications. The timing seems weirdly coincidental too, with the big 4 banks about to launch their own instant payment platform in the form of PayID

If anything will make the bubble burst, it's ICO's. They're extremely similar to the IPO's that caused the tech bubble - millions of dollars worth of investments into companies with no actual product

I think people are certainly trying to, yes

I just get the feeling that if we don't self-regulate soon, the crypto market will definitely need outside regulation to prevent something catastrophic.

It’s going to dip a lot more soon, check the mempool, there’s still over 80K unprocessed transactions

Yeah, I'm not sure about Japan in particular but in most places court-mandated liquidation is usually carried out very carefully

Your calculations are wrong, if Bitcoin became as big as the USD, it would level at around $500,000, considering the total USD in the world sits around $10.5 trillion, and 10.5 trillion / 21 million = 500,000.
As someone mentioned in another comment, total global currency is around $60 trillion, so in the most absolute ridiculous scenario where Bitcoin becomes the new global currency reserve, each coin would be roughly $3 million. That's the absolute highest the currency could ever possibly reach.
Kinda puts a damper on the plans of people who expect to buy 1 BTC today and end up billionaires in 10 years time

Because this subreddit just likes to parrot core dev's opinions and LARP as if they're saving the world by defending Bitcoin from the evil scary menace that is scaling block size

It's not illegal to withdraw your own money, but yes your bank will probably file a report with the IRS, who will shortly come knocking at your door wondering why you needed to withdraw that much money. I think banks are required to report all transactions over $10,000, but most banks will report any other suspicious transactions too (i.e. withdrawing just below 10K in hopes to avoid being reported, withdrawing up to or more than 10K in one week through several transactions, withdrawing similar amounts of money periodically)
In which case, you'll just have to report your purchase to the IRS. It's not illegal to withdraw money and use it to buy Bitcoin as long as you're upfront about it, follow the appropriate channels to report the transaction, and pay the required taxes

Provided you had an account without 2FA on an exchange that allows you to sell BTC for XMR, I think you could definitely fake having them stolen.
