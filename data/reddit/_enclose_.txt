Sooo... How would one go about buying some of those shares?
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:04:07
Ok, guess I'll wait. And if it gets cancelled, try again with a higher fee. Thanks for the swift responses. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:06:16




Hah, haha.

Its not well done though, although it does have a sarcastic tone, the author keeps it just vague enough to not be really sure. If it were a reddit post, it would definitely need an /s at the end or half of the people wouldn't get it and downvote it into oblivion (like what's happening on the author's twitter right now, basically).
And to be fair, with all the "fake news" (god I hate that term) and manipulative media nowadays, I wouldn't have been surprised if she were deadserious.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:16:53
Congrats man!
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:04:58
Welp! Looks like I'm in the "infinite" range... 
Is there any way to cancel the transaction and up the fee?

You're one of the pioneers that drive mainstream adoption of btc, thanks ;)
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:18:15
I'd give you gold if I had any. Have a nice day ;)
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:37:11
Yes, I'm sending funds from a blockchain.info online wallet.


By deleted, do you mean the transaction just gets cancelled after a certain period of time not being confirmed?
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:02:01

Thank you for everything you've done, u/Pineapplefund

Pretty sure gold nor silver are legal tender in most of Europe

Where do you live? I have never heard about anyone taking gold except for those seedy 'cash for gold' stores.

I think you'll be hard-pressed to find any "great person" in history that didn't have some serious flaws compared to our modern values.

North Korea isn't communist, its closer to fascism. They dropped the whole communism shtick in the 80s if I'm not mistaken

I'm not talking shit about Marx nor anyone else in particular. Just going on a tangent really about the fact that every historical figure will have some dubious qualities for which people will condemn them. Be it serious character flaws, badshit crazy ideas (these usually go hand-in-hand with genius ideas, Newton is a good example of this), changing societal norms, ...

A lot of terms used in US politics are completely stripped from their true meaning. Socialism is probably one of the most used.

Disregarding your analogy (which I don't think is quite accurate), the same thing can be said for banks, yet a lot of people lost a lot of money they had stored in banks not that long ago during ~~the~~ yet another banking crisis. It shouldn't really be allowed to happen and surely the banks deserve the majority of the blame. But you as individual also have an obligation to research these institutes and ultimately decide whether you trust them with your money or not, knowing there's never a 100% guarantee that your money is safe. Whether something is *right* or *wrong*, whether something *should* or *shouldn't* be possible/allowed is unfortunately often irrelevant in the real world.

I've never been a sportsfan, I can enjoy watching a handful of sports from time to time, but I never got that over-the-top excitement that so many people seem to experience. I never quite understood what the big deal was and my thinking was pretty much like u/acered24 
Then, a few years ago, I was dragged to the local pub by my friends to watch "our" team play live in the football world cup (the one with the round ball, not the eggball). I tell you, it was a fucking blast! I get it now. Its as much, if not more, about the energy and cameradery than anything else. For those 90 minutes all of us in the pub were best mates, cheering together, cussing at the screen together, celebrating together.
I'm still not into sports, but I feel like I 'get it' a bit more now. And on occasion I'll join my friends to watch a game, even though for me the sport itself is not that important, but the sense of 'brotherhood' (due to lack of finding a better word) is amazing.

Me too, I'm slowly accumulating more BTC one little deposit at a time, but the price is almost rising faster than the funds I can put in it. It sucks to receive a smaller amount of BTC every time I buy for a set amount of money. But on the other hand its nice to see the investment I already made grow so quickly, however little it may be.
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:29:07
Not cool man, Its one thing to lure someone to a disgusting vid for it only to be a rickroll. Luring people in pretending its just a rickroll to then see images like this is not cool. You might scar people like that.

I'm new to bitcoin but it seems weird to me. Like propaganda. I'm not freaking out (I've bought recently), i'm gonna hold on and see what happens since I've only invested what I can afford to lose, but I always get sketched out when too many people say the same thing.

Smartphones are also literally everywhere. Went to Vietnam a while ago and we were in the middle of of nowhere on a little dirt trail when we suddenly came across a farmer standing near (his) 3 water buffaloes, he had no shoes, a worn-out overall, a big buffalo poking stick... and a smartphone.
It was a bit surreal to see, I had to seriously revise my Asian stereotypes!
