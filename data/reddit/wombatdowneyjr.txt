Hmm, the article seems pretty well received among Chinese netizens, and they're just majorly pissed off at PBOC now.
The sentiment among the Chinese is that the PBOC done goof, and they're going to come crawling back to the Bitcoin community in time. Most Chinese Bitcoin holders will have no qualms trading on overseas platform, and only small time players will be removed after this Chinese exchange ban. This will also spur the development of decentralized exchanges, as everyone would be eyeing the isolated Chinese public.
However when I was translating the article, one thing that surprised me was how strongly protective they are of BCC, and how the consider Bitcoin Core to be a foreign threat (while they're making money off it). S2X, and further hardforks down the line are going to be ugly.

The sheer promise of Bitcoin’s future in facilitating a multi-trillion, decentralized trade industry alone would always draw the attention of China’s brightest and best minds in IT. Even if crytptocurrencies firm in China is forced to shut down, foreign companies would jump at the chance to employ the best talent that would be squeezed out of a job. So in one fell swoop, the Chinese authorities had potentially cast away a bunch of law abiding, tax-payers who will now bring their expertise to other countries to develop new technology that could one day generate trillions of dollars in revenue. The sheer of idiocy of how they handled this is staggering, and it would only be fair to rank them among the greatest traitors to China in the 21st century.
Once again the author would like to reiterate, decentralization is the most enticing promise that Bitcoin has to offer to the Chinese, it is perhaps a manifestation of their desire to be truly free. The adoption of a decentralized currency is what POBC fears the most, as it erodes their control over Chinese citizens.
Some thoughts about the communities affected by this Bitcoin crackdown,
**1)	Obstinate government officials and out of touch technocrats**
Few points to ponder about this recent crackdown, Chinese officials were dead set on banning exchanges instead of looking for a more nuanced solution during meeting with representatives. The Chinese prides itself on being a technocratic society, however those in power are no longer up-to-date in their knowledge, and they no longer possess the ability to properly judge and evaluate new ideas and technology.
State appointed experts had this to say when justifying the central bank’s decision to deny Bitcoin status as a currency “Bitcoin does not possess the basic quality of being a currency because it is too volatile.” The logical fallacy in this statement is apparent to all. For example the Japanese Yen had fluctuated from 1:80, to 1:180 USD over its course of existence, does this volatility disqualifies it as a currency? Besides, even as the value of JPY fluctuated wildly, good prices remain stable within Japan and did not changed wildly according to the whims of the international currency market. This is because it takes time for the price fluctuations to be accurately reflected in daily goods, we can hypothesize that the same will hold true if a nation were to adopt Bitcoin as a currency. In fact we can further conjecture that as more countries were to adopt Bitcoin as a currency, businesses would begin fixing their goods to a price in Bitcoin, and this would ultimately limit its volatility, and signals its maturation as a widespread currency. Hence, the “Bitcoin is not a currency because it is volatile” is a poorly constructed excuse by PBOC.
Lee X (some spokesperson from PBOC?) also states that the amount of fiat currency in circulation can be adjusted according to the needs of the economy, but Bitcoin which is capped at 21 million tokens does not offer this utility, hence it is unsuited to be a currency. The author has no idea if Lee X is trying to be sarcastic here. Historically, the amount of fiat currency in circulation had always been determined by the monolithic body known as the central bank. Most central banks would ultimately succumb to the temptation to print more and more money as a makeshift solution to whatever economic issue the nation is facing, and ultimately drive the value of the currency into the ground. The deflationary is intended precisely to counter the central bank’s autocratic decision to inflate fiat currency and to better serve as a store of value. 
Another madam Lee XX (from a certain research institute) simply claims that Bitcoin cannot be a currency because it possesses no utility. What a joke! As if all those colourful paper bills—fiat currency in the world is any different. If we were in an utterly lawless society, it is safe to say that a paper bill’s utility lies solely on the paper that it is printed on. If we were to completely disconnect Bitcoin’s potential to be used a currency, at the very least it grants its user access to one of the most secure ledger on the planet, the Bitcoin blockchain, and therein lies its most basic value—as an irrefutable proof of value. 
Some naysayers also say that Bitcoin is a “non fiat currency”, and thus it cannot be used as a legal tender. However, they forget that fiat currency is a relatively new invention that had only emerged over the past 200 years. Before the emergence of fiat currency, the world’s commerce runs entirely on “non fiat currency”, as long as the buyer and seller can come to a consensus on its value, any currency can be legal and proper tender.
Some also say that the absence of government oversight on Bitcoin makes it insecure and risky. This is another laughable idea, since when does government oversight makes something secure? For instance in response to the Chinese stock market crash of 2015, the central bank allocated a large amount of money to prop up the stock market, however some of the team members in this operation siphoned off money that was mean to resuscitate the nation’s economy. In the end, even though some of the culprits had since been arrested, but most of the money they siphoned off had been transferred to overseas account and could no longer be recovered. Most of the perpetrators were state appointed regulators. Thus, having government supervision is no guarantee, in fact, given the rampant corruption among state officials, the opposite is more likely to be true.
In contrast, after this most recent Bitcoin crackdown, all the Bitcoin exchanges have assured their clients that they had sufficient liquidity to fund all their deposits, none of them had misappropriated the funds that their client had entrusted them with. In this regard, these unregulated, non-state sanctioned entities proved to be much more trustworthy than government appointed regulators.
By blaming losses caused by investments in cryptocurrencies due to the lack of government oversight is truly a staggering display of double standard. For instance, ever since the establishment of the Chinese stock market, it had listed many dubious companies, and every few years a stock listed company is found guilty of defrauding their investors. The Chinese stock market is notorious for having circuit breakers, to shut down for the day when too much loss is being made, does that have anything to do with the lack of government oversight? 
However, even amongst the doom and gloom regarding the POBC latest decision, we can see still some silver lining. For instance, they are no longer accusing Bitcoin to be a “tulip mania” like they did in 2013, nor did they brush off the significance of Bitcoin by simply stating that they will issue a Chinese digital currency to replace it with. Prior to making this decision, POBC had started sending out auditing teams to various Bitcoin exchanges since late 2016 to explore the possible repercussions of shutting down Bitcoin exchanges. In fact even after the initial ICO ban, they clarified that they are not banning the trading of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As for the closure of exchanges, the central bank handed the smoking gun to CAC (Cyberspace Administration of China). This shows that central bank officials are now careful not to take on the Bitcoin industry head on, and they’re already trying to remove themselves from the responsibility for pulling the trigger on an action that could very well end up being a big mistake.
It is increasingly difficult for state officials to force the advancing society to adhere to their old fashioned world view. Not even 10 years ago, POBC were trying to forcefully buy gold from the Chinese public at a state sanctioned price of 90 CNY/gram; buying/selling USD and HKD on the blackmarket was a capital offence. The stock market was once thought to be an exploitative tool, a lazy, non productive way to make money and was criticized heavily by the government. However, as the Chinese market opened up, the initial stance taken by the central bank was proven to be wrong again and again by the public. History will repeat itself, and the central bank would eventually learn to embrace Bitcoin.
	
3 years ago, Russia was enforcing strict laws, banning the development of Bitcoin in the country. Now they have completely reversed their stance and is now actively encouraging the Bitcoin/cryptocurrency industry. The Russians realized that over the past three years, the cryptocurrency movement have gained significant traction and now possess considerable momentum and support from the public. They also realized that by actively promoting Bitcoin, it possess the potential to one day erode the dominance of the USD on the world stage. The geopolitical power of USA is still unparalleled, and one day, when China would have inevitablly antagonized USA, it would experience the unfairness of a world dominated by USD. If that day ever comes, let’s hope that PBOC still remembers that the anti-USD weapom, Bitcoin still exists among its citizens.

Thought this subreddit wanted some perspective from the Chinese regarding this exchange ban. If you consider this to be FUD, then stick with reading HODL and China ban stuffs memes.

**2) The public tend to blindly follow trends**
The real casualties of this most recent Bitcoin crackdown is not early adopters that the public was so infuriated about. It was the weak minded public that started buying Bitcoin when the hype was at its peak.
There was one coal mine owner whose coal mine operations got suspended by the state. Recognizing that the Bitcoin market was in a buying frenzy, he reinvented himself as a cryptocurrency expert, and started an ICO for some XX altcoin. It was not difficult to obtain some endorsements from financial institutes and other experts as long as their palms are greased, and with this purchased gravitas, he started shilling his altcoin to people in his village. How cryptocurrencies work is essentially a black box for the general member of the public, and simply by associating it with Bitcoin, people will start buying in with the idea that they could too make it big like the early adopters of Bicoin.
Traditional Chinese way of life dictates that the general population should obey authority without question, and if these authority figures started filling their heads with the dreams of splendour, they would suspend all critical thinking and start to entrust these authority figures with their money. The rampant proliferation of ICOs, the main trigger for the exchange ban was caused by these dishonest leaders and their blind followers. With easily corrupted officials and leaders at the helm, and easily swayed followers in abundance, it is no wonder that scam ICOs flourished in China. In fact, this worrying culture concerns this author, on whether or not a truly decentralized, self-governed currency like Bitcoin could truly flourish in China.
 **3) The promising younger generation**
The early Bitcoin miners, mining cluster owners and Bitcoin exchange owners are largely comprised of youth born in the 80’s and 90’s. They have demonstrated their technical knowledge, ideals and abilities over the past few years as they made a fortune for themselves in the Bitcoin industry. They also displayed commendable calm and poise as the events over the past few days unfolded, in the face of seismic changes, by keeping communication channels open with their clients throughout the process, they also proved to be well run, and had sufficient liquidity to fund all withdrawals. They were also remarkably graceful in the face of hostile pressure from the central bank, choosing to peacefully retreat instead of kicking up a fuss that could complicate matters further. This was in stark contrast how state-sanctioned, government regulated markets responded in times of crisis. Their performance under pressure, illustrates that the future of China rests in safe hands.
This author had maintained since 2004, that the millenials are China’s best bet in the future. They benefitted greatly from the modernized education system China implemented, possessing good knowledge, administrative capabilities and are quick to adapt. They also tend to be able to look at the bigger picture, and unlike the older generation, they are no longer solely focused on short term gains to the point of gross misconduct. In the past, during the aftermath of financial crisis, it is quite common to see that businesses running away with their client’s money, attempt to rally the public to escalate the situation, or simply unwilling to be transparent. This had been a litmus test to check the calibre of these young industry leaders, and they had passed with flying colours. Perhaps they felt content with the fortune they had made by being early frontrunners in the Bitcoin industry, and was no longer willing to make an ultimately futile stand against state authorities. Perhaps closing down the exchanges was a better alternative than to waste time wrangling with PBOC and other state-approved experts that are trying to weigh them down. They head earned a well deserved reprieve after their successful endeavours in developing the Bitcoin industry, and the author wishes them all the best in their future endeavours, and hope that when their time has come, they would assume their mantle as China’s leadership and lead the nation to a brighter and more illustrious future.

Due to the 3 major, and 3 minor factors listed above. A major upheaval was bound to come for the Bicoin industry. However, its timing is certainly quite rushed. Now that the hurricane had arrived, will Bitcoin die off in China?
Reflecting on the future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in China,
Now that PBOC had laid down the hammer, the crowd of short term holder and opportunists surely would be dispersed. However, as devastating as this clampdown had been for the prices of Bitcoin, this author believes that what PBOC did is no more than a storm in a teacup, and in time would be yet another blip in Bitcoin’s ascendancy:
**1）The journey is full of twists and turns, but the future remains bright**
Financial instruments are human inventions. There would always be trailblazers, forging a path ahead and calling out for people to come join them; and as more people come on board it would no doubt be met with resistance from authoritative figures. Early adopters will have to weather the ups and downs together, before the financial instrument stabilizes and eventually become widely adopted. Be it fiat currency, stock markets or bonds, they all went through the same growing pains, and now they are all regarded as textbook knowledge, a symbol of stable investments. Bitcoin is currently going the same trials.
**2）To forge a better future, Bitcoin must first temper itself**
The main threat to the survival of Bitcoin is not interference from central banks, after all there are the very entity that Bitcoin was designed to counter. External factors such as the advent of quantum computing,  hackers, fluctuation in value are not big threats to the continued adoption of Bitcoin. The biggest threat to Bitcoin’s survival lies within the current limitations of its mechanism of design. The 2017 hardfork arises from its limited block size, and the two solutions proposed to deal with that issue. 
It is well within expectations that there will always be disagreements when it comes to these type of patches, especially when there are so much money at stake. However contentious hard forks will always dilute the Bitcoin brand and weaken the public’s trust in it, so hopefully this intervention by PBOC will serve as in impetus for the warring factions in Bitcoin to come together and overcome any obstacles that would emerge in the future
**3) Humans are resourceful and will always adapt to their surroundings**
Decentralization is the most enticing promise offered by the adoption of Bitcoin, however this decentralized currency still requires a centralized exchange at this point of time. Centralized cryptocurrencies exchange had always been a stopgap measure, and even without the intervention of PBOC, the decentralization of exchanges is an inevitable necessity. The Bitcoin ecosystem will only be truly completed when all its components are decentralized. When that happens, Bitcoin will truly take off, and no Central Bank in the world would be able to halt its growth.
On a lighter note, during this latest crackdown, some self-proclaimed Bitcoin experts opined that since a lot of Chinese nationals can’t understand English well, transaction volume in Bitcoin will naturally decrease as Chinese users are forced to use overseas exchanges. This is a truly laughable notion, what dictates that an overseas exchange cannot have Mandarin as one of its language options? Besides, as long as there are profits to be made, these foreign websites would be more than happy to provide a language option for some minor obscure Pacific Islanders, let alone Mandarin. In the age of cloud storage and computing, all the data and information held by Chinese exchanges can be easily transferred to an overseas server with a single click. The notion that a service offered over the internet can ever be completely banned by a nation is truly laughable. Even if the Chinese authorities managed to split the internet into China and the rest of the world, the financial losses caused by such a move would be catastrophic, and the censorship enforced can easily be circumvented via the use of VPN.
