I would like to buy it but I am hesitant because whoever made the design of the cover has very very bad taste �� would look terrible on my bookshelf and an insult to BTC.
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:35:59
120 USD you can have it ��

I wish ai can visit someday. Apparently its too dangerous now.
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:35:41
They don’t print this one anymore but the currency is still fucked
@_date: 2019-08-05 14:53:46
The value could actually rise since this is a collectors item ��

Thanks �� how do I withdraw?

You can buy it for 50-100 USD depending on where you order. There are online shops like 
 but I got it on ebay. Beware of fakes!  -&gt; 
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:03:30
Yes it is
@_date: 2019-08-23 17:55:56
Incredible, when did they change it to what it is supposed to be?
@_date: 2019-08-05 23:34:16
Yes you can still get those. 100 Trillion is expensive though since it was taken out of circulation and its the highest denomination they had. It has risen in value because its a popular collector’s item.

I hope Venezuela can recover and prosper sometime in the future. People are fleeing and the largest oil reserves on the planet stay untouched. Its terrible. Apparently even people in Cuba are doing better. Do the people in Venezuela have the possibility to store their income in other currencies?

Wow crazy, don’t you use scales to weigh the money there because there is no point in counting? Whats going on with the crypto petro btw? ��
@_date: 2019-08-05 23:15:49
Yes I really like the typo too ��
@_date: 2019-08-05 16:50:55
Thanks for the help
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:41:39
I got it from ebay. Be careful, there are a lot of fakes.

This picture is 4 years old and was not taken in Canada. Its an indoors Cannabis plantation in the Netherlands.

For some people its the only way to have access. Its also a nice way to spread the word and make people crypto aware ;)
@_date: 2019-04-22 20:21:23
Buy and sell ��
