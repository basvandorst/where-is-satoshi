E-coin u mean i think, the management is still on e-coin
@_date: 2016-04-26 14:22:11
Opskins and bitskins support bitcoin atleast, they are 3rd party item selling sites where users can sell and buy for real world currencies

Can you give the link to the blockchain or the txid?
@_date: 2014-10-17 09:39:48
Signed this!

That 536 sat/byte is pretty huge. I usually use 100-150 when there is under 5k unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:45:00
You can find some info on fees here: 
But yeah mobile applications usually dont have a custom fee option.
@_date: 2016-06-12 13:18:59
Bitstamp, coinbase or wesellcrypto for paypal
@_date: 2016-06-13 04:53:37
No problem my friend :) The only downside with it is that you have to send some verification, but you have to do that with many other services, also you have to pay a little extra for paypal, but its understandable because paypal is quite risky for sellers.

As long as you are only running a node, you could do these commands: "ll /media/yourusername" 
Then see which one is your partition and do "chmod 777 /media/yourusername/thehddpartition" then everyone and everything will be able to write and read on the partition, so do not store anything like bitcoins on it. Let me know if that worked :)

Will you print guns and ship worldwide? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

I suggest getting a ledgerwallet nano s, then downloading their OS and generating the seed offline on their OS. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 15:19:15
Btc-e, bitstamp, wesellcrypto (paypal), virwox, and poloniex or bittrex for btc to altcoin exchanges
@_date: 2017-01-13 19:16:44
Atleast on finnish ATM's by bittiraha.fi you get the cash out instantly, but they have sell limits like 1000€ by transaction i think.

Yeah im only joking around, i think that 3D printing is really awesome and fascinating subject (i cannot afford one of the devices). i hope the best luck to your company, maybe one day i'll see you on news :D
@_date: 2017-01-10 08:01:58
Actually the cash was never yours, it's owned by some authority usually. Sad but true (that is why it is illegal to burn it).
@_date: 2016-12-25 14:11:05
And the OP mentioned that bitpay has 5$ monthly fee?
@_date: 2016-12-23 22:25:57
Ledger wallet nano s is pretty decent too
@_date: 2016-12-25 19:14:22
Some people do not have balls to handle the pressure of the marker, i think it is pretty funny
@_date: 2016-12-25 11:37:11
Actually im not sure if it works with nano s 
Edit: maybe knows
@_date: 2016-12-24 21:26:53
I paid 17$ for e-coin/wiredx card which has 1€/1£/1$ fee monthly only. Some downtime yes but ive been happy. If you want card for -25% price i can pm you my referral link since they give a discount via referral links. Let me know via pm if you do.
@_date: 2016-12-25 08:19:26
Monthly fees are cheaper, so at the end you will probably end up on profit.
@_date: 2016-12-24 06:34:39
Are you still waiting it to arrive or? I have had the ledgerwaller nano (the old model) for like 1 year now and been pretty happy with it. I recommend getting microUSB OTG cable, so you can use your ledgerwallet with mycelium even on the go :)
@_date: 2016-12-25 18:19:50
Bitcoin ATM, coinbase, locabitcoins, bitstamp.
@_date: 2016-09-05 03:34:14
I have been very happy with e-coin card.
check if you want if your country is supported: 
Im not sure if this answered your question but, if you happen to be somehow interested on the card shoot me with pm. if you order a card with referral link you get -25% off the price.
@_date: 2015-04-29 07:22:00
Yes finally i am on time! Thank you sir!
@_date: 2015-04-27 07:46:51
no i was late nooo :(
@_date: 2015-09-17 11:17:46
Enabled in finland!
@_date: 2016-10-14 17:44:39
I would suggest not to use this, i cannot even find source for it. Probably a scam
@_date: 2016-05-07 08:36:08
Its a bitcoin subreddit lol
@_date: 2016-05-07 08:21:49
I hope it will fail, those greedy fucks should be left behind and stop stealing better ideas from others (yeah i know bitcoin is open source but its just disgusting these big companies trying to take control of something that is free)
@_date: 2016-05-07 08:23:39
I want to meet her sister
@_date: 2016-05-15 13:29:21
Dont forget syscoin 2.0 and shadowcash, to my understanding those are superior over openbazaar. I will get lot of downvotes tho im sure of it
@_date: 2016-05-07 08:27:31
He is lying! Im the real satoshi, the reason im so poor is that my dog peed on my previous pc and it started to burn. And no i dont have backups so i cant prove anything.
@_date: 2016-07-15 14:33:03
I already have the app, i have been pretty happy with the card tho. You still have alot to improve tho.
@_date: 2016-07-15 14:11:18
Well, i have had their cards for half a year or so. It works 90% of time, they have had sometimes downtimes on card loading, but i have always been able to withdraw etc.
@_date: 2016-07-16 11:02:29
That means guys, dont send the btc straight to DNM's, because most probably they will come after you.
Edit: this includes betting sites too
@_date: 2016-07-15 11:31:22
So far e-coin has been pretty much 5/10 experience for me, lots of issues meanwhile loading the card etc.i hope that they wiöö manage to fix their issues.
