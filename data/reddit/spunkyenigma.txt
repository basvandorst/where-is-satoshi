They already do limiting on things like spam and DDos attacks, net neutrality is a scary concept with some very slippery slopes.  I live just outside your district and would love to discuss this further if you're interested

Is SD one of those places that doesn't let you select which wallet winnings go to?  It's like going to Vegas and playing with cash and expecting cash back on every bet , it 's just weird.

Just daytrade on the exchanges and that way you don't have the fees and delays of going into and out of the Federal system for each transaction

Due to American security laws, they didn't allow the purchase of the tokens by Americans 
@_date: 2017-04-03 20:10:48
