Pfffff....15 yo....

Don't answer like a kid. This is just how Ripple works, i don't say that's good or not, but it is growing. Look at the reality.

What is a blockchain kid? And don't look on Wikipedia, lol
A lot of kid here, on Reddit, a bit retarded, who just "believe", and BTC need more than that, i told you
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:15:09
14,12K here : 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:58:31
14K now, i meant that it going down since it reached back 15K, i must stop to look at these charts, hypnotic, lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:38:26
There is a lot of sell now on BTC charts, people should be afraid, or want to keep money now that BTC has came back to around 15K$
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:39:40
Funny boy, don't cry, lol

This is the market, just look at it. Ripple is more centralised than Bitcoin, but BTC is centralised too as you know with big mining companies. Btc must improve, and don't stay "as before", cause there is really competitors here
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:39:42
Totally agree. It can help too to understand why the big fall, to panic less ☺️
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:35:06
There is new cryptos which are growing fast, pre-mined ones,  fast transactions, low fees, useful in real world and "approved" but banks, Ripple, Stellar, Raiblocks And other strong projects from Asia : Icon, Qtum
So BTC will absolutely have to improve (Lighting network, other stuff) to resist to that. Just my thought at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:41:29
It is going up now. 
You are right, the BTC network works like shit with several days for just a transaction, looks unreal and unefficient
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:36:42
You don't have any arguments, you are just a believer, BTC need more than that.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:32:24
Poor little boy. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:31:41
Use your brain. New coins are growing. BTC must improve, and be faster. For your information, i don't own Ripple, only BTC.
As you talk, you look like 15 yo?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:37:29
You don't even know what is a blockchain, i guess, how it works, you just want to have the last word, kid.
