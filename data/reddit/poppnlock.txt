actually all those eth tx's are low cost low size spam tx's by a large hodler, trying to create the narrative that eth is better with tx's when in reality it isnt

the fee situation is looking alot better the last few days
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:15:33
yeah those comments come from no-coiners, who think that bitcoin is  "just another asset class"
if we see a financial crisis again, bitcoin will really move up. actually bitcoin has cornered the banks into a spot where, they cant let a financial crisis happen again, just for this reason.
thats why you dont see any headlines about banks being in trouble anymore, they realize that bitcoin has changed things a little.
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:26:05
dont know which site is correct, doesnt matter, tx's are cheap again!
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:40:16
indeed, although no 1 sat tx have gone through yet, this is a big win for bitcoin

when btc breaks up in your face, youll know you were wrong

theyre just salty cuz they missed so much gains by using bitpay and not actually accepting bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:48:07
Yeah, sometimes ill go in there and just tell the truth. but the OP i dont think is gonna be in a good mental place to do that from
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:05:24
everything, what dont they lie about? going back to when roger made a large tx with many outputs, it was unconfirmed for days,  he proclaimed everywhere that it was because of the blocksize and a blocksize increase was necessary. well some people took a look at the tx, realized that it was because of tx malleability, not because of fees or blocksize. and roger never retracted or apologized for that statement. he and do alot of that.
another way they lie is they accuse of doing everything that they do. for example, they say we are all core sock puppets and core has no support, when they are one's using sock puppets to astroturf r bitcoin and other places. also they accused greg maxwell of attacking r bitcoin recently, when it was obviously them. 
a more accurate question would be, what dont they lie about?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:20:13
it wasnt bitcoins fault, such is life, there will always be a % of people who commit suicide.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:29:54
I guess you missed the memo, when the mempool was low, that it was a good time to consolidate all little tx's together, rofl
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:35:24
very sad tale indeed, reminds me of the story of the bearwhale from 2015, who lost millions for the exact same reason.
You have to remember for every person on who legitimately thinks that roger knows best, there are 5 or 6 paid shills from central banks and govs around the world.
this is why they have no problem constantly lying about everything. roger and co are useful idiots, the major force behind that is people who hate all crypto.
Just look at the guy has been embarrasingly wrong since 2014. he called it a bubble back @ 1000. any normal person would have deleted their account in embarrassment, but he is still commenting, he even comments in pretty regularly now. why? because the guy is paid shill, he gets paid to come here and talk shit, it doesnt matter to him that hes been dead wrong and missed the breakout of a lifetime, hes getting paid to post.

The reason for the backlog is a bit of miner manipulation. when difficulty resets down in about 9 days, the backlog will be cleared.
its fine, temporary growing pains, community has shown we dont want a rushed hardfork.
I would like to see the core devs release their own hardfork, when we they are ready.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:49:05
well when they lie about basically everything in an attempt to trick people, dont you think thats devious?
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:08:39
If you dont know what the fuck youre talking about, just dont comment.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:33:51
thanks but i would never be stupid enough to do this. There are many people here who have given the advice , over the years, dont buy miners, just buy bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:08:30
really big upvote for this article, I echo these sentiments exactly. 
The media have no reason to be scared or feel threatened. when they asked jerome powell what was he going to do about bitcoin, that question was completely unnecessary. bitcoin is WAY too small to be bothering him with that question, and I loved his response too.
He said the truth, he simply said bitcoin is too small for the fed to worry about.
All these people who have anxiety because bitcoin crossed 10k, all these European bureaucrats calling for action against bitcoin, are really acting far far too soon.
They shouldnt even look at btc until it crosses 1 trillion market cap, IMO. otherwise its too small and a waste of their and everyone else's time.

@_date: 2017-03-06 06:37:50
yeah but they cant naked short sell which is a big difference, and still even some big players arent more powerful than the overall trend.
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:07:41
So true, great link. 
Many people are critical of libertarians in this space, but weve known for along time that the elites are running a massive scam, and that its one set of rules for them and another set of rules for average citizens.
This is why its frustrating to see people like chris derose and junseth ( among others ) accusing bitcoiners of being conspiratorial, well guess what, 
THE ELITES ARE RUNNING A CONSPIRACY!!!
Basically max keisers entire show exposes this over and over again.
HSBC was caught laundering money with drug dealers in mexico for hundred of billions, and payed a small fine when found guilty, in a fucking court! thats not a fucking conspiracy!!
anyway these reasons and basically everything covered by max keisers show is why alot of us are in bitcoin, because bitcoin is honest!!
great link guys

@_date: 2017-08-16 02:38:21
the problem with this comment is your assuming buying is a bad idea, when its a good idea

yeah july is probably comparable to may and june, in that regard
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:37:52
really doesnt matter, its a small pullback, i didnt even feel it

ouch, you sold the absolute low, LOL.
personally im suprised that someone who thought it was a scam , owned btc in the first place.
@_date: 2017-01-13 13:27:36
no its bad, all this is bad. most of the up pressure recently was because of chinese leverage trading. this is bad.
with that being said though, all chinese major players, and alot of other major players have already dumped so anymore fud at this point isnt going to do much.
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:04:20
when you say money do u mean cash or bank transfer ? lol
oh shit in canada u might need to do local bitcoins, paxful for cash purchases, or
quadriga.ca ?? i think is a canadian kyc exchange
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:05:34
what were you saying? XD
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:16:49
nah, thats not what the post said, and the price has recovered. just do us all a favor and go away with your bad calls
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:03:47
so because you dont own any, you need to do an emergency buy asap,regardless of price. because it could move 400-600 dollars in a day, and you dont want to be buying after that. 
after you have a more established position, you can worry about market timing
@_date: 2017-01-13 13:46:56
theyre a bit late arent they? lol time to short was last week
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:47:06

thank you, agreed, wasnt there just a post like this yesterday as well? mods need to start deleting these troll posts

@_date: 2017-11-07 16:36:12
Either way poses risks. if we make no change, The biggest miner is a malicious acter with bad intentions, and he may cause other problems for us down the road.
The miners who like asic boost can still switch to bitcoin cash, so it wont be that bad
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:21:20
yeah that part of the comment was aimed at the r/btc crew that really claim to have a really really big problem with segwit.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:54:34
Yeah ive noticed this too. Its on bitcoin markets too really bad, the need for mods has increased. it could be related to roger paying people to do this astroturfing stuff. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:43:24
I just want to say, we are all bitcoiners together, jihan, roger, everyone. why not get rich together? 
this decision to call of 2x is great for everyone, and its the right and logical choice. we ALL have too much money at stake. 
Im happy for all bitcoiners. 
If you truly hate segwit and bitcoin, bitcoin cash is there for you.
I Have no hard feelings towards anyone and lets all get rich together

Thank you good sir, however it wasnt about big blocks, it was about who controls bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:35:18
Well, If the miners fork off, and take 75+% of the hashpower with them, our incentive to keep the same POW is now much less. Its a good opportunity for us to hardfork to a POW change.
I would prefer the miners listen to the users, but they seem not interested in what users want. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:01:00
I dont, im all in
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:52:54
very interesting multi-sided attack on bitcoin. pump the tx log, dump btc, pump bch.
now that the bch pump has cooled off, it appears hes pumping dash next rofl. he just wants to see the dominance index drop, thats his favorite arguement for why core has failed.
@_date: 2017-09-25 03:31:38
the shorters are desperate to see a pullback, im not sure theyre gonna get it!
@_date: 2017-09-28 10:06:06
ROFL, its pretty straight forward. just like in real life, everyone here is talking their book.
Everyone crying doom is short, everyone saying moon is long. its much worse over @ bitcoin markets.
and according to bfxdata, there are still ALOT Of people short, and they are under alot of pressure now
which way are we going? i say the moon, segwit 2x will be another special dividend for bitcoin holders, maybe a small dip.
@_date: 2017-09-30 09:38:25
Dug mine out of cold storage 2 weeks ago and sold it for btc. 
They gave it one attempt at a pump, it was decent but fell flat. now i think the techincals are ruined for a second pump, also it looks like the whales are preparing for the next hard fork and have given up on any bch pump.
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:33:37
ROFL @ this post, the content and the timing. were you short bro? XD
@_date: 2017-09-28 10:22:50
I always tell people, If you dont own any bitcoin, you have to emergency buy asap, regardless of price. once you have a more established position,  you can worry about market timing then.
For now youre risking the price moving $1000 in a day, against you
@_date: 2017-10-04 03:31:56
Indeed this has been their strategy, to just accuse rbitcoin of all the shady stuff that they do themselves.
Part of rbtc is people who want to see bitcoin fail, like actual trolls, teamed up with useful idiots like olivier jansen
@_date: 2017-09-28 10:17:20
Yeah, the price drop to 3k was a dramatic over reaction, a 40% price drop. thats why the correction back to 3.8 was also so sharp. so remember 40% isnt small impact, its huge impact
china fud is priced in @ this point
@_date: 2017-09-28 10:08:42
feels good man. everyone who missed out on bitcoin, or doesnt own any, has an incentive to encourage others to dump!
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:03:59
is that the whole point? really? xd
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:57:11
not really because the people there would have to buy bitcoin first. unlikely.
unless you want to loan them your bitcoin in which case im sure they would be interested in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-01 10:30:36
Why does barry want to fire the core devs? I dont get that part
@_date: 2017-09-25 02:52:31
dont worry, you cant change it. Craig wright is part of the deep state's plan to destroy bitcoin, thats why when he announced he was satoshi, they put him on the bbc and has MSM headlines about it. google is part of the deep state as well so they go along with the narrative.
be glad bitcoiners are too smart to be easily fooled!

Never heard of winning the breakup, typically in these situations women have the power, and since your hurt emotionally, she has already won. its not a bad thing, its just the way life is, and its the way most breakups go. 
To get revenge you must sleep with more attractive women, that is the only thing a women will be jealous of. if she sees you in 20 years and youve done well, she may not even care, esp if shes rich herself.

let them fomo @ $35000 
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:33:35
thats what i dont get about the guy, If core is so bad, why not just trade your coins for a different currency, perhaps one of the alts hes so fond of? by holding his bitcoin, he is supporting core. 
Hopefully after their next failed hardfork, he really dumps his core coins and let these two or more groups go there different ways. fuck. he spends so much energy attacking core, but wont sell his coins. bizaare

No, paying fees does not defeat the purpose. If you pay a fee and your bitcoin goes up in value, you make the money back.
there is almost no way to exchange between any 2 currencies without paying fees

satoshi said in the white paper, rather than have a fluctuating supply, he would have a fixed supply.
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:55:38
Welcome good sir. the question everyone who doesnt have any coins has to ask themselves is, "when will you fomo?"
and 5200 probably will be a good entry when people are asking themselves that questions @ 10k
@_date: 2017-09-25 03:22:18
stability was never the goal. again satoshi talked about this in the white paper.
rather than have a volatile supply, he saw a volatile price would be better. volatility is cooked into the equation.
I tell people who are interested, embrace the volatility of bitcoin, dont try to argue against it, you cant change it anyway.
@_date: 2017-10-04 04:15:04
Its a good point which i raised earlier as well, the big block hardfork crew already shot their bolt with bcash, And it broke the spirit of the NYA agreement. There is no need for another hard fork.

@_date: 2017-05-26 13:28:52
ya, instead listen to r/investing, where they actually know what theyre talking about
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:39:59
sure there is alot more going on, youre right but for brevity sake i only posted most important stuff.
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:48:29
ok good point i dont know for sure but i would imagine you can get something together, maybe not
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:13:47
hope you took my advice and bought kiddo, price is now 2020
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:27:04
welcome aboard good sir
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:02:13
yeah i know that moron, its unlikely a bitcoin skeptic, would download it when no one even knew about it. 
he even claims he mined 10, when the block reward was either 50 or 25
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:18:30
i cant say i miss gavin, remember this is the guy who went to the cia, who proposed 8mb blocks, and who was fooled by craig wright  ( or even worse, paid off).
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:45:28
Yeah , I agree with you. who goes through the trouble of putting money on an exchange, and then throwing it out. 
Even more suspicious, a guy who replied to his tweet said "me too, i mined 10 and threw them out, dont think they are going anywhere"..
..... who goes through the trouble of buying miners and setting up miners if you dont believe in bitcoin? 
very bizaare, I think theyre both lying, and I think we are gonna see more of this from people who are attention seeking
@_date: 2017-05-14 05:13:22
jesus, even i was able to buy @ 230
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:11:59
never take advice from "friends"
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:36:48
wtf, lol the kid has 50 bucks and u 2 are talking about the stock market, volatility, centralization, rofl.
yes, just buy bitcoin ffs
@_date: 2017-05-23 12:57:56
actually its technically not
@_date: 2017-05-12 00:22:28
im suspicious of this post. "many" "new people" just know to "ask you" ?? rofl, alot of unlikely events there. who are you andreas a? 
i call bullshit
@_date: 2017-05-10 02:46:40
no, haha. is the bitcoin price because of media attention? ROFL, the media almost never covers it and when they do they cover it very negatively. bitcoin price exists DESPITE media attention not because of it.
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:11:29
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:35:41
yeah  just scroll through the tweet replies to see, he claimed he mined 10 bitcoin.
of course he didnt, and hes a liar and an attention seeker, but ya
@_date: 2017-05-06 03:20:29
ROFL, buttcoiners get in here asap!
nice title too
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:21:10
Thank you so much for this post. You said basically my entire argument. I personally was never fooled by the disinformation/confusion campaign that the enemies of freedom have so much experience running, however I never owned even a quarter of the coins you did.
Your post is basically my entire arguement.
bitcoin works fantastically with no problems. thats right bitcoin has NO problems. there is no scaling issue.
every single backlog in utx's is caused by a spam attack, not legitimate tx's.
core developers are people who truly support bitcoin, and the goals set out by satoshi, and the cypherpunk community that inspired and did pre-work on his work.
You make a great point, their arguments appeal to emotion, not technicals.
again thank you so much for this post, if i had sock puppets id upvote it.
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:34:37
the fomo is on, get your bitcoins while you still can. 
in china they are paying that just for the right to withdrawl in a month.
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:03:06
well just because youre incompetent, doesnt mean that bitcoin usage has to be a disaster. bad title
@_date: 2017-05-20 12:12:31
keep dreaming breh
@_date: 2017-07-06 11:25:10
wow, kind of annoying to watch. Andresen got what was coming to him. talking to the cia, being fooled by a fake pgp signature, the guy is just naive Af. plus he hadnt submitted any code in a while because others were doing it, which is fine.
I dont understand these peoples non-sensical hate of the core devs. they do great work often for free!
the jihan stuff is just unreal. im fine with 2 coins, btc core and btc bitmain. let them fork , we will go with segwit and have 2 coins, its gonna happen anyway.
@_date: 2017-05-11 22:57:33
uhm mods plz ban this buttcoiner
@_date: 2017-05-11 22:58:01
soon , very soon
@_date: 2017-07-20 04:45:29
rofl, you admit its deleted, but still want to argue. what a cunt you are!
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:54:59
nice trolling
@_date: 2017-05-10 07:27:51
if it could be hacked, do you think it would have ever gone beyond $5 in value?
You could only destroy if you destroyed every copy of the ledger on the planet.
Of course its very safe, this price move wouldnt happen if it wasnt safe.
@_date: 2017-07-08 14:19:23
annnd the original comment is gone! lol, looks like i was correct again
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:29:24
I personally do not believe this story, I have too much life experience to believe this rofl. heres why:
1, no ones parents invite you to come live with them and be with their daughter, just doesnt happen.
2, the claim that she told you to sell it all, is just out of the blue doesnt make any sense.
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:43:49
your first point, that was the case until recently. they have come up with a plan to stop it and the time was now.
@_date: 2017-07-08 14:20:00
original comment is gone, rofl, looks like i was right again. dont be so naive as to fall for obviously fake storys, all you commenters
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:01:35
in an even less likely scenario, you want me to believe that a bitcoin skeptic downloaded the client in 2010 and started mining.
even worse is he claims he mined 10 bitcoin, which is wrong because you could only have mined 50 or 25. 
as if, its fake, im not fooled.
@_date: 2017-07-29 23:57:13
sure but im saying, if they came in with even halfway reasonable fees, they would take market share very fast. that was the whole point if the post really.
with a minumum withdrawl fee of .003 btc, they are coasting off the fact that there is little competition
@_date: 2017-05-15 02:13:49
Ya this guy is pretty dead wrong. he called for a dollar crash from 06-2014 , when the dollar went on a massive tear and he has basically been dead wrong for a long time. hes wrong about bitcoin too. hes wrong about emerging markets as well.
the only call hes been right on was gold, which after 2012, even that call didnt look so hot
@_date: 2017-07-09 23:29:11
thast what the OP says
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:14:25
pretty much , i mean these are all low over head operations, ive heard 1broker is just 2 people. 
also were not talking hundreds of millions, maybe a couple mill a year. also the fees are pretty egregious so its not just a complaint
also, it would more than just" a little bit of book study" (rofl) to learn how to code an entire exchange
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:33:17
depends, if you dont have any bitcoin, which it sounds like you dont, you need to emergency buy asap regardless of the price. once u get a more established position, you can worry about market timing.
@_date: 2017-06-05 00:51:23
beautiful, nice post. i knew this would happen, everytime there is a backlog, the network just grinds through it. there is no scaling issue with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-07 05:51:25
yeah, not a mistake i would make, but thanks for looking out! i will hodl!
