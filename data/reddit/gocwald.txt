At the time of writing this I have about 80€ worth in btc on the trading markets... came in with 50€ of btc about two months ago... better than just ~~hodling~~ 
Yeah I could lose money... but I can also earn it a little bit more. It is not a great sum of money but one must start somewhere. I also buy btc around 50ish €uros almost every month but not every... one must pay for living.

Don't worry about it... i see that a lot... I posted a thank you note to the  **BEAR** on subreddits that are about crypto... lets say it did not go well...

**HOW LOW CAN YOU GO**
i bought bitcoin starting in nov 2017
and now i am down 60%
yes, i did listen to people on here, and even read books on bitcoin, everyone was saying it would keep going higher, up to $40K (maybe even higher).
and guess what? I was so dumb that i listened to people who said that.
oh well...
i lost most of the money that i put into bit coin (which i accept full personal responsibility for).
i have not sold any of the bitcoin that i bought, and i will just hodl, but in my non-expert OPINION, i think that bitcoin will keep crashing (just like its done ALL of 2018)
...and its STILL crashing hard, worse and worse it gets.
oh well, the logical part of my brain knew it was a gamble from day one, and i only invested what i could afford to lose (but "afford" it or not, it still sucks to lose 60% of what you put into something). i learned my lesson, and i will never buy bitcoin again.
I HOPE it goes up, but it probably won't (i think)
I've been wrong before, obviously... so i'll just hodl in the meantime, and unless bitcoin goes to 20K again, i will continue to hate it, just as i do know.
