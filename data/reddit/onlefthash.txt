Happy to see BIP 100 and BIP 101 formalized with detailed solutions on how to raise the blocksize limit.  I sincerely hope BIP 102 will be Blockstream's detailed counter-proposal to raising the blocksize limit, since there is rough consensus that it needs to be raised eventually (and better to fork sooner than later).  It's obvious Blockstream dislikes 100 and 101, but I really want to see them offer a concrete roadmap soon rather than just criticize BIPs 100 and 101.

Thank you for taking the time to enlighten me.  
@_date: 2015-06-16 02:51:34


I'd rather see the core devs and other folks with "bitcoin expert" next to their handle get together to find some common ground and come to a compromise solution.  If the handful of experts can agree on something the rest of us will follow and there will be no contentious hard fork.  
@_date: 2015-06-21 21:31:41
Absolutely correct.  Not mutually exclusive.  I want larger blocks but I still see great value in sidechains and lightning network.
@_date: 2015-06-15 14:34:59
I really love the idea of Sidechains and Lightning Network, but sure seems like the Blockstream guys just want to keep the block size at 1MB to prematurely force everyone to their solutions (which are not ready for prime time yet).  
As far as a can tell -- correct me if I'm wrong -- Sidechains and LN still work just fine with blocks larger than 1MB.  So why not support the block size increase and let the market decide if Sidechains and LN are worthwhile when they are ready?    
Adam is afraid of a non-consensus hard fork, and rightfully so.  But if he and his Blockstream cohorts would just get on board with a larger block size, then we would reach a safe consensus.  It appears these guys are putting Blockstream before Bitcoin to me.   
@_date: 2015-06-26 15:16:53
Correct.  Blockstream needs a scaling Bitcoin for both sidechains and lightning network to work long term.  My understanding is Blockstream doesn't want the limit raised as much and/or as quickly as BIPs 100 and 101 allow.  Hopefully BIP 102 will reveal Blockstream's detailed preferred path to larger block size limits soon.  
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:10:45
I'm trying to understand what the "actual reason" is.  Until that gets flushed out, it gives the appearance to the community that the guys from one company who view block size opposite most everyone else have "some secret plot".   
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:05:58
Thanks for your response.


If we eventually need to get to hundreds of MB for SC's and LN, what is the harm in the BIP 100 proposal of going to 2MB blocks now?  If 2MB (or 8MB or 20MB) would lead to too much centralization, what's going to happen when the blocks are 100's of MB?
Bitcoin adoption comes in waves.  I think it's important to have the block size big enough to handle the next wave while you are developing SC's and LN.

Regardless if one is a small-blocker, large blocker, or someplace in between, it blows my mind that there are people who think it's okay to censor Bitcoin XT discussion out of r/bitcoin.  XT is completely germane to the block size debate, which is completely germane to the state of bitcoin today. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 14:20:56


I edited the part of my post that accused you of being for censorship.  Your previous posts made me think you were.  If you are against censorship I encourage you to be vocal about Theymos' overreach instead of supporting his right to censor "his" forum.  I like to think it's "our" community.


XT doesn't hard fork until it reaches 75%.  That's a pretty sizable super-majority in my opinion.  How much of the community do we need on our side before you feel we've reached general agreement that bigger blocks are necessary?
@_date: 2015-08-16 23:55:40
And all we ask is that Blockstream come to a consensus within their company and submit a BIP detailing how they would raise the limit.  Please stop criticizing other devs' detailed, concrete proposals and submit your own better way forward.

Why would the 21M cap need to be raised for the price of bitcoin to increase significantly and be useful in the long term?  
@_date: 2015-08-12 21:26:00
Thanks for trying a second time.  Am I still in the majority if I don't agree with it the second time around either? :)


As long as the value of BTC at least doubles with each halving, the incentive to make blocks remains the same or greater without raising the 21M cap.  BTC price doubling every 4 years isn't that much of a stretch looking back over the life of bitcoin.  If the bitcoin ecosystem continues to grow -- and scale -- I think this will continue to happen.


There will be a block reward for about another 125 years.  So, yes, depending on a rising value for BTC will be sufficient to compensate the miners without raising the 21M cap for a very, very long time.
@_date: 2015-08-17 03:16:26
Correct; I was happy to see it.  Is all of Blockstream in agreement that sipa's proposal is the best way forward?  Sipa's BIP is Blockstream's final offer?
@_date: 2015-08-19 02:07:00


I really like the direction you are headed here.  This sounds like a better way forward to me.  Thanks for the response and thanks for doing what you guys are doing.    
@_date: 2015-07-01 13:04:51
Or maybe it's just that more people would rather raise the block size limit soon verses keeping it at 1MB indefinitely.  
@_date: 2015-08-12 20:23:46
*Here is CoinCadence's full post in that thread for a little extra context:*


False. I do not recognize or accept this to be true. This is completely counter to Bitcoin's original vision and its growth and use since the genesis block.
The first sentence of the Bitcoin whitepaper reads:


Even the title of the whitepaper states it is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, not a settlement system.
Side chain projects have huge potential, and are definitely needed to scale to global transaction volumes. However, we are no where near that point of adoption yet, and these technologies are a long way from being ready.
There is plenty of room currently for scaling block size. Whether it's 2MB, 8MB or some other number is unimportant. Miners will find a balance between block sizes they are willing to create and transaction fees all by themselves, they are incentivized to do so.
To argue that the Bitcoin core developers that work for Blockstream are not incentivized by the opportunity for greater profits by limiting the capacity of Bitcoin is ridiculous. I do not know any of them personally, or their actual motivations and morals, and it is also irrelevant.
The incentive exists whether they are motivated by it or not, and cannot be discounted or swept aside as irrelevant.
Let Bitcoin grow without your artificial limitations, there is still plenty of room for glory and profit for Blockstream and the Lightning Network.

Be sure to rewind the video, because the points Andreas makes regarding block size limits before the 40 min mark are even more important than his points after the 40 min mark.
@_date: 2015-08-11 13:01:49
Blockstream the company hasn't been filibustering for years, but the individuals who eventually formed the company have been stalling on a block size limit increase for a very long time.  I think that's what he means by "Blockstream guys"...not the company itself.
@_date: 2015-08-12 13:52:17
A big chunk of the centralization section hinges on this potentially misleading statement:


The word "income" here could be misleading.  While it is a fact that they will be taking in less bitcoin due to the halving, that doesn't necessarily mean they will be losing money, losing participants, losing hashrate, losing general interest, etc.  As bitcoin adoption and demand increase, coupled with the supply decrease (halving), market forces should drive the value of bitcoin up.  
It is not a fact that the miner's income in terms of dollars/euros will go down over the next several years.  It's quite likely that it will go up, especially if Lightning and Sidechains add significant value to the system. 
@_date: 2016-02-15 17:31:21
I don't advocate the PR layer totally distorting or putting words in the devs' mouths.  I would want the PR layer to add professionalism while maintaining transparent technical debate.  Primarily just filter out the ad hominem and passive aggressive attacks.  Having these high-profile devs on both sides sniping at each other like children is hurting their respective organizations' images and eroding confidence in bitcoin as a whole.       
@_date: 2016-02-15 16:21:12
Exactly correct, which is why I hope Blockstream takes a portion of their venture capital and hires some good technical public relations people to be liaisons between the devs and the public.  This will allow the devs to concentrate on what they do best and will help bridge the schism in the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2015-07-01 16:43:40
Fair enough.  The debate is polarized into those for BIP 101 and those against.  Since those against (Blockstream et. al.) haven't proposed a BIP or any detailed concrete plan on how soon or how high they would raise the block size limit, I think it is fair to say they want 1MB indefinitely.  If Adam would put out solid plan to raise the limit I think many would get behind it and the debate would be fundamentally changed. Instead he is putting forward conspiracy theories that those down voting posts critical to BIP 101 are paid trolls.

I agree pricing in terms of bits would help bitcoin.  A good way to make this happen is to simply start talking in terms of bits on reddit/twitter/etc.
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:55:54
It's up to all of us to start talking/typing/pricing everyday in terms of bits.  That's how it will happen.  My coinbase account has given me the option of using bits as the base unit since 2014!  My breadwallet also displays in bits.  The companies have given us the tools; the community just needs to start using bits as the default lingo.  Once the community talks overwhelmingly in bits, then the media, businesses, etc, will follow.
