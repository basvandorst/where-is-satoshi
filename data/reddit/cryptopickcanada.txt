There are alot of cities in Canada that need more coverage. Will mostly be focusing on BC/AB for the time being.

Balancing out in the sense of the speed plateauing to a steady level. There will still be growth of course but I don't see the same rate of it for the coming year.

Thanks for all the support emails guys and gals =)
@_date: 2014-12-23 19:02:36
Appreciate your comment and opinion but it is just a suggestion based on a few stories for last year. Have a great holiday!
@_date: 2014-11-16 08:17:03
The idea here is to focus on not saturating areas, but instead keep the network wide and accessible. I do agree that more locations close to transit would be helpful and will keep it in mind.

Sorry for the delay I have been down in San Diego! , the unit currently carries a 5% Fee with limits of $500 per transaction.
@_date: 2014-12-04 03:35:21
This is all great feedback and is well received and appreciated. I really do agree on the margin for fees needing to be lower and more accessible. The problem right now with the other comment is many Bitcoin companies are not in the position to support a BTM network in every city. So the setup of the infrastructure lies with us as operators. Hopefully more comments keep coming in.
@_date: 2014-11-08 05:41:19
Absolutely , especially we get some great business done!

 Hi there, Im assuming you are saying we stole your logo. This is not correct in any way, our logo was sourced independently. I have taken a look at your site and see the similar 3 circular lines with the ~H~ at the center. Luckily there is a reason they are so similar. The 3 curving lines where not created by you since they are public license on 3 separate logo creation sites (even a free one) . since our logos differ after the 3 same lines made most likely with the same site it cannot be a copy. If you would like to talk more about not claiming free licenses  I am more then willing.

 - Thanks , definitely could have been more specific
 - Currently our 4 units are Buy only but don't rule anything out in the future.
 - Same my friend, no issues as of yet and a great API with VOS

Official Release:
Cryptopick Canada is proud to announce that after many months of planning we have opened up our first ever Bitcoin ATM (BTM). It is located at the Thirsty Camel Café in Nanaimo, BC, Canada. The unit itself is the “Satoshi 1” provided by Genesis Coin that provides instant sales of Bitcoin via Canada’s Vault of Satoshi exchange. Our goal at Cryptopick Canada is to provide instant uninterrupted access to Bitcoin to the population of Vancouver Island. We thank the community for all your support, and look forward to continuing to serve you as our network expands.

We definitely will , currently just working on the new site @  
@_date: 2014-12-03 03:18:55
I like your points, it is definitely ahead of the curve. The same idea happened in the late 80's and 90's with cash ATMs. The real idea is to provide an access point to new users. We need to stray away from the idea that the Bitcoin user cant just be a regular day person or someone who values there information protected. But yes the idea of what you are saying is correct for some current users in some countries. It should be considered that with all great inventions change and adaption can happen very quickly but without infrastructure there is no way to spread it.

Good Morning,
All units will be Satoshi 1's provided by Genesis coin. Fees are currently set at 5% to cover our rent/exchange fees/company growth. these fees are always being reviewed. It is also important to note that each unit deals with BTC only and all transactions are instant without delay.

Where you my gifter!?
@_date: 2015-01-30 17:11:52
I see your just trolling , Well all I can say is your opinion is valid as its your own. There will always be supporters and haters for any topic. As far as terminology the reporter used her own and I had no review or edit of the article prior to release.
 
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:40:39
I know, I want too but on the island! , grab me a few )
@_date: 2015-01-30 17:06:01
Thanks for the input! , They told me between web/print they have an average of 750,000 readers , thats where the number came from . Your correct that obviosly not all readers will read every article. But overall it should expose a lot of people who may still have never heard of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-30 17:13:38
Agreed I was just excited when it came out , a better title should have been 750k people will be exposed to this article. Will keep it in mind for future announcements 
@_date: 2015-01-02 01:36:43
Agreed but for some reason it would not let me post it there? emailed admins but no reply.
@_date: 2015-01-30 17:06:30
 whats your issue?
@_date: 2016-02-17 18:04:40
Haha , Thanks for the ideas guys and gals
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:00:10
Hahaha Thanks , Every time I sit on the can I get to stare at it on my leg.
@_date: 2015-02-25 11:16:04
Well appreciated and open to comments. As stated these reviews are based on read personal accounts and not a direct technical analysis. Feel free to comment any corrections directly on the video. Thanks
@_date: 2015-02-25 12:23:03
Your are correct, Currently I do not own these products. In a previous video I requested users of hardware wallets to send me there experiences with the device they purchased. All information I portrayed in this video is a combination of the results of said emails and some basic information from company websites. You are also correct that I do not always trust every posted online review. This is why I chose to seek my information directly from the users themselfs. Thanks again for your input
