Ok, now it shows 1 confirmation.  Is that good?  QuadrigaCX needs 4.  I waited 25 hours for 1 confirmation, does that mean I have 75 hours to go? Sorry for the stupidity of these questions.

Thanks, I appreciate the response!  One is better than none.

Thanks, but the person who sent it to me can't increase the fee now.  How long could I expect to wait for it to get confirmed with that fee?  They said 8 hours, now it's 24.  Worse case scenario?  Is it lost forever lol?  Thanks!

It's in a block, 467863, which is maybe good because all day yesterday the block wasn't in the system.  When I look up the block number on blockchain.info, I can find my transaction.  80% of the 2872 transactions have been "spent" but the rest have been "unspent", including mine.  I have no idea what any of that means.  In my QuadrigaCX account, it still shows as a pending transaction with 0 confirmations.

Interesting.  Quadrigacx's customer support has been terrible.  One person said it would take 8 hours, another said a day, two tops.  They said they can't do anything on their end.  They eventually told me to leave them alone and go to reddit, literally.  But they made it clear there was nothing they could do, it's been "received" and is in some "block" and all i can do is wait.  Seems inane.  Never had this problem before, always got the BC in a matter of minutes.

Lol, that's what I've been told.

$1.71USD on a 82USD transfer, that's like 2%+ in fees.  What is the point of BC if you have to spend a lot in fees.

Indeed, strangely after I made this post, it went through in an hour or so.  82USD became 93USD in 1 day...
Thanks to all for their help!

TYVM.  It's crazy that BC is exploding yet it takes a day plus to send 82USD.  I'll make sure the sender increases the fees in the future and do more research on how much is appropriate.

glad it went through this morning and not an hour ago lol
