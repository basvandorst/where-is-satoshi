I would have been tempted not to as well, I mean that would take me all the way up to 60.00002901 BTC! However, as a recently single father of two, trying to raise them as honest individuals who work for, and earn what they have, I couldn't have kept it. I love having money as much as the next person, but knowing that I kept that amount of money, when I took my daughter back to a Halloween store in October because she stole a $4 ring and I made her return it, I couldn't look her in the eyes and tell her that I could justify it more than she could justify wanting that ring.

Aaaand I found out about the redeeming just after it shut down. Either way, thanks for the time and effort you put into this in the first place! I look forward to it coming back online, and one of these days contributing to it as well.

Not better. I would rank both of you among the most honest people I don't actually know.

So do all of the trading sites just have wallets they buy/sell from then? If that is the case, is there a reason I am limited to buying BTC on a future date on coin base? My apologies for the lack of knowledge on the topic, I only have my phone right now to access information.

Hindsight is 20/20. At least you bought in. I bought my first .02 two days ago, figured better late than never.

I just got hooked so I probably don't count, but I think it's much more interesting to me than stock names and such. I think it also makes it more appealing to the young(er) crowd (I'm 28).

An interesting concept. Right now, I don't donate plasma, but I actually think this would entice me enough to go back. And as some people will probably point out, yes, I could just deposit the cash and buy BTC. Having the option available to be instantly paid in BTC would interest me more because of the ease of the transaction, rather than going to the bank, depositing the cash, then purchasing online (today my first purchase transaction was completed, took 5 days for .02 BTC).
On the flip side, I am not sure how successful it would be though, because when I used to donate, a good majority of the people who were there, were in need of cash, not an investment (is BTC considered an investment?).

Currently I am sipping on a dram of Auchentoshan Three Wood Single Malt, though I may have a sip of my favorite blend as well, 21 Yr Chivas Royal Salute. I had not seen that! At $25 a bottle with a blend that includes Islay, I'll probably buy a few bottles if it hits the shelves here! Unfortunately, living in Utah, I can't get it shipped in if it is only available online :(

Thank you! Guess I'll be getting coffee in the morning :) but tonight is a scotch night. Have a great day!

I had it done by a friend a while back, however when they shipped it, USPS /Fedex/UPS (can't remember) asked if there was any liquid, and they just said no. If you plan on doing something like that, make sure the bottle (if it is glass especially) is very well protected because a lot of the time packages get tossed.
