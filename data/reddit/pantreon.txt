I'd have to say this is the most important update in the history of BTC. Shame that it happens on a day of yet another 'hack'.

May you live in interesting times.

You know you don't have to buy a whole bitcoin right? BTC is divisible to 1/10,000th

I'd be very apprehensive at taking anyone's speculation as advice.

Considering that bitcoin is essentially a buzzword at the current point in time, is this point of difference not enough?

But while it's an exception to the rule of standard payment options, their point of difference alone probably nets them a significant customer base.

Congrats! Sounds like hard work has paid off.

You should get a hardware wallet, storing cryptos on exchanges is not advised.

Rightly so, volatility is not something that any retailer wants.

Why invest in something you see as a 'shit' product. Do you invest in things you see as having no value?

Physical wallets work well. Many wallets offer a paper wallet, or if you want to take things further you can use a hardware wallet like the ledger nano s, the important thing is to use 2 factor verification.

When you were partying, I studied the blade. When you were having premarital sex, I mastered the blockchain. While you wasted your days at the gym in pursuit of vanity, I cultivated inner strength. And now that the world is on fire and the barbarians are at the gate you have the audacity to come to me for help.

BTC, yes. BCC is also not bitcoin cash, it is actually bitconnect. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 08:06:04
That's a really good analogy, thanks.

The few retailers that have accepted BTC payments barely saw any, many decided that the hassle wasn't worth it.
