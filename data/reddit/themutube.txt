I use bitcoins to fight the system. If your not fighting the system, your are the system.

Thank you, 
The criticism is not necessary.  Please forgive my mistake. Kindness holds more spiritual value than proper grammar. You are human also so I don’t expect much.

Wonder what the initial fees are or were. 
Raise fees by 30% then offer 20% discount.  
People love to spend money when they see discount or sale signs. 
20% discount? Wow, sign me up for those crowns.

Great deal if you’re the receiving party.

Where were you in 2009 when bitcoin came to be?  Do you know why bitcoin was an idea in the first place?  I know your asking a question and assuming people use it to trade. Those people are day traders. Long term goal has very little to do with monetary value in my opinion.

I appreciate the lesson, believe me. I was just being lazy while walking into wrigley field. That is no excuse for my lack of proper grammar. 
One of the main reasons why I love the reddit community is because other people can learn from each others mistakes. 
I applaud you for pointing the out that error on my part and giving the proper example of usage. 
I left facebook because I was starting to pick up lazy writing habits. 
I joined reddit to cure my apathy.

Right on! 
Classic 1950s whip for me. I personally would love a car with history behind it, rather than something that just rolled out of the factory.

Well these sure as hell beat any apparel I have seen with dollars on them.  Dollar boxer shorts, dollar design hats, dollar design shoes, dollar design shirts.  All garbage.  Thank god for crypto, I no longer have to see people throwing dollars around or holding in their hands like a damn fool saying “hustling”

The future of money? 
For a lot of people it already is.

I Live in the US and I agree with you. Don’t get me started on soccer when the rest of the world calls it..........

Give the money to a willing parent. Have them create an account and deposit fiat from their bank into a exchange.  
Buy coins and transfer to your own ledger or wallet. 
Hold until 18 then create own account.

I wanted to invest in 2009 but had the same fears as OP. I acted on the fear and did nothing. My suggestion is to locate a bitcoin machine and push dollars into it and take your receipt and tell nobody about it.

Is that a scale in the background for weighing precious metals. Throw fiat on one end and silver or gold on the other end.  Ask which is worth more and why. Then explain bitcoin.  Good luck lol

I will return to the mall later within the month, make a transaction and update here. I did not have time to wait until the installation was completed.

Thank you for posting this. I was in Ron Paul campaign back in 2007 and 2011. I First heard about bitcoin from a Ron Paul supporter in 2009.  
@_date: 2018-02-19 01:59:47
Yes 
@_date: 2018-07-10 12:21:32
The post I have seen lately are that of cnn quality. Another post said “Price 6,666.66$ wow sign of devil. Welp im out.”
I Wouldn’t  be surprised if cnbc flashed that price on the tv. 
This sub was better when people talked about tech and not price.  Can someone please send me to tech only sub?

Good point, that may very well be true.  Always a good thing to have another perspective.  Thanks mate.

What kind of people buy shirts with their state on it? Do they not know how to remember or describe where they are from?  Might as well get an entire map on their shirt so they don’t get lost.

How many of these articles are being written by the Japanese or Koreans ? 
Im not concerned with articles or news segments from the reporters in the  US when tech is  in Asia.  
When we want to learn about something new, is it best to learn from younger more ignorant brother or the older and wiser brother?
