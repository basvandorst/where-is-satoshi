Subscribe to their mailing list, they announce some pretty significant actions almost daily (insider trading, misleading investors, fraudulent reporting, laundering, etc. and more recently ICO scams). Pretty interesting stuff.

Don't beat yourself up too bad, I finally mustered the courage to see what I've sold since 2014... It was 35 BTC. But it all made sense at the time.

My withdrawals usually take about a day, even though coinbase says it'll be like 4 days. Not sure if it's the same for deposits
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:30:28
It's moving again
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:15:21
Uh, mayyyybe the pump has something to do with Coinbase enabling BCH transactions...? Surprised it only doubled tbh
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:15:01
High fees? Gdax literally has 0 fees for market makers (limit orders) OR withdrawals
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:24:10
Yes that's completely possible. On the exchange, you just place a sell order instead of a buy order
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:26:16
Is there a list or guide of all the BTC forks so far? 
Clams... Bitcoin Cash... Bitcoin Gold... What else am I missing?
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:36:57
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:25:20
Ok I'll buy yours for 0
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:17:50
Good learning lesson

I consider my full time job to be saving as much money as possible. The more I save, the more I make

Shows like Fast Money's formats consist of interviewing CEOs of various companies, mostly small cap or startups, who cover all the pre-approved talking points and softball leading questions. Every person they interview on that show is a salesman on behalf of their company (or interest) trying to bring in new investors. They'll never purposefully try to hardball their guests. I think the people that watch those shows understand that all the interviews are a sales pitch/commercial and Ver's interview doesn't stand out in any significant way from the rest in that regard, except perhaps for his tendency to bash the competition.

How would that have helped this video? It's not a landscape. It would have only unnecessarily made everyone need to rotate their phones to see it properly and would have negatively affected the picture.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:37:03
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:35:57
Yeah it's the same company. With gdax you can placed advanced orders and the fees are WAY less

The guy had never heard of LocalBitcoins before, he said it was really hard to find people to exchange with, he just listed his business on CoinMap and waited for walk-ins. The inflation rate here is pretty fucked, he seemed to want as much as he could get his hands on and had the cash all ready to go in rubber bands
@_date: 2018-05-05 00:19:35
Some places do as I mentioned but I assure you 95% of hotels, restaurants, and stores here are "solo efectivo"
Edit:  I dont wish at all to disparage South America, it's amazing here, I'm just saying that my reality as a budget backpacker is that it has been very hard to find places that will accept "the world's most commonly-accepted credit card"
@_date: 2018-05-05 03:54:02
Of course
@_date: 2018-05-05 03:40:16
Already am. Peace!
@_date: 2018-05-05 01:50:20
You're right, I was thinking because it was over his rate that I won. But it was still a little bit under mine. So I guess the accurate statement would be that we both saved more
@_date: 2018-05-05 00:10:12
At first I looked for a Bitcoin ATM but there aren't any around. AFAIK they all charge like 10%. This was a best-case scenario!
@_date: 2018-05-05 03:51:46
I could have definitely shown from my phone that I had sent that transaction. Much more so than with cash. It might have taken a bit of explaining for the officials to understand but it's pretty clear cut. And yeah I could see the confirmation just as soon as he could.
For clarification, I have records of all my transactions and 2++FA so I could hand over the details without my balance being compromised
@_date: 2018-05-05 00:09:04
There's a cafe in Prague that only accepts Bitcoin and Litecoin. No cash or cards. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 22:11:29
 He said after 1 confirmation he'd give me the cash. I was having lunch there anyways so halfway into my pizza it was a done deal. 
He was clearly the owner, it was a fancy cafe and he was a professional guy so he clearly wasn't going anywhere, plus he showed me the cash beforehand.
It was super simple and smooth, I didn't worry for a second.
@_date: 2018-05-04 22:24:06
That's like the perfect analogy, it's like I am always carrying a bag of gold coins, that I know I'm never going to lose or get stolen or get questioned by customs... And if I ever get in a pickle, no matter where I am, I know I can always swing by a pawn shop and sell it for food or cold card cash. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 22:15:14
We actually both got a better deal... The site he was using must have been on South American exchanges or something because BTC was a few % cheaper than on my exchange. We actually met in the middle meaning he gained a couple percent and I gained a couple percent too. Win-win!
* Edit * we both saved a couple percent, relative to paying the others' rate
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:02:08
There's a bunch of people who have already tried traveling using only Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-05 01:10:34
I'm in a major city with over 1 million people. Nobody accepts cards here. And why would I leave the jungle just because they don't accept cards there either? Not sure what you're even here arguing about
@_date: 2018-05-05 00:26:00
Lol I've sold over 35 BTC and am nowhere close to a millionaire.
I regret nothing.
@_date: 2018-05-05 04:04:26
Yes. Good to have a bit more liquidity for cases like these. Just keep it small and locked down, obviously.
@_date: 2018-05-05 02:39:53
Sorry for generalizing but it really doesn't matter
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:08:27
Nope, seems like it but I'm not crazy enough to visit Venezuela right now. There's pretty bad inflation happening elsewhere also
@_date: 2018-05-05 03:32:59
Cool so you've been to 3 of the countries in South America. And clearly not the one I'm talking about. Carry on brother ��✌️ 
@_date: 2018-05-05 02:24:16
Inflation is pretty nuts in some countries... Picture lines around the block, of everyday people, to withdraw their deflating currency from banks, and some brave independent exchangers grouped up next to the banks around the main plaza hustling a couple percent... Been an eye opening day here
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:13:18
Domestic, sure. For international they will send it express, but it it can't get there overnight. Then to get through customs it takes a few more days. The bank told me to expect 5 days
@_date: 2018-05-05 04:17:37
I see your concerns. I considered them all but in my careful judgment, everything was ok (as it was.) Any cash transaction would be much harder to prove.  Yes it was trust based, sure. But this is a cash&amp;trust-based society we are talking about. (And also he owned a high end cafe, this wasn't a street deal.) We both had records of his deposit QR code, but at the same time for a few hundred bucks it's not worth it for either of us to fuck each other over (his front windows cost much more than that). If it were big money at stake, there would have certainly been extra security protocols on both sides of the tx.
@_date: 2018-05-05 00:24:56
I'm gonna go ahead and say that's bullshit, I'm literally in South America right now and I guarantee you it's a very small minority of places that accept cards. Maybe at McDonald's in Buenos Aires or something but I'm backpacking on a low budget and I literally walked around for an hour in a million+ population city looking for a hotel yesterday that would accept credit cards, the only one I found charged 25% more if I paid with a card. Only places that accept CCs are super touristy expensive places.
@_date: 2018-05-05 00:06:51
I think it speaks to the liquidity of BTC. I had no traditional way to access my money but since I had some BTC, I could easily access my cash in even one of the unlikeliest places. Not to mention I didn't have to pay any transfer or exchange fees, or wait a day for the wire to clear, all which are features of the bank system.
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:04:50
I am posting this here because the question pertains to BTC addresses - the BitcoinCash factor is actually irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:21:03
I wish I could have witnessed it!
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:22:29
You can always buy more Bitcoin, you know.
You could literally buy it instantly and send it straight from the exchange. 40 cents a gallon is a massive savings.
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:02:54
I keep a bookmark of the rollercoaster guy website on my bookmarks toolbar that still says $1453.99
Love that snapshot. What a ride it has been.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:15:20
Amazing. I was here. And this is still just the beginning.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:31:34
Hell yeah that was the class action that got me into class actions.

Between 0 and 21 million BTC
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:58:55
Thanks yo, you too.  Bought my first at $60
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:28:47
Holy shit thank you,
grace be to that person placing the 32 BTC buy order at $9999.99 after all that.
Legendary order!
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:09:18
Try Changelly, Shapeshift, Kraken, or Bittrex.
Shapeshift has the highest fees. Changelly is around 0.5-0.7%. Kraken is broken, avoid unless absolutely necessary. I can't speak for Bittrex but I think they are licensed. Good luck
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:21:01
Search your old emails and bank transactions to find out which exchange you bought them on. Hopefully they're still just sitting on that exchange.

Personally, I just cashed out enough to float me until the new year. And if things look up before then, I'll reinvest.
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:10:22
My theory is that David Kleiman kept 1.1 million BTC encrypted on a USB drive and when he died it was all lost. That's why Craig Wright claims to be Satoshi (in reality he's only 1/3 of Satoshi) but can't prove it because he doesn't have access to the coins. Read this article, especially the last 3 paragraphs 
@_date: 2017-06-24 14:28:36
NOT Coinbase/GDAX. They're causing nightmares for a lot of users right now.
