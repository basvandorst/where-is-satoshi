I understand where you're coming from, but simply running an exchange on donations alone is not feasible.
If we look at the US market alone for a second, you'll need a MSB License in every state and register with FinCEN at a federal level. Now simply registering with FinCEN isn't such a big deal in terms of time or expenses, but to acquire MSB Licenses in every state will amount to 1-2 years and two digits of millions of USD to lawyers and variety of surety bonds.
That's for the license to legally run an exchange. Now you also have to be compliant in a multitude of other legal areas. Which admittedly is less time consuming and expensive than MSB licensing, yet still requires full attention.
We're talking about significant investments to run in the US alone. Although US is a special scenario. Running an exchange on donations will get you no where, and anyone claiming to be doing that, is either very likely lying or too incompetent to see it through.
Now once the appropriate regulatory paperwork and licenses are completed you may begin developing the software and internal procedures.

Without an MSB license you will not be servicing the US marked legally. One of the charges against Charlie Shrem (Bitinstant) is in fact for running an unlicensed exchange.
Anyone is free to try to run a non-profit, but the business (or non-profit organization) still needs to be compliant in accordance to relevant laws, Bank Secrecy Act being one of them.
@_date: 2014-02-08 19:09:31
Yes, you're right. What it boils down to, is if you impose AML/KYC and MSB licensing on your business transactions. It is more complicated than that, but financial services is one of the most regulated industries out there.

If you want to be safe within the regulatory and legal framework when using Bitcoin, just think of Bitcoin as a foreign currency (Yes, I know this isn't the official definition from various governments).
Now ask yourself if you'd feel comfortable exchanging 30 000 USD for Euro or the other way with anyone without considering any laws.
FinCEN has issued guidance for bitcoin a couple of times. I've seen someone mention a threshold for when you're considered an MSB but I'm uncertain about the magic number.
If you're operating in the US:
Bank Secrecy Act
Patriot Act
MSB Licensing
The above mentioned is strictly in terms of handling the trade of currency/bitcoins themselves. If you're running an incorporated exchange you'll have to abide by a bunch of other regulation too.

Yeah thanks. Soviet did not practice communism, but rather a totalitarian version of it. Which made me wonder what the difference between anarcho-communism and communism.
It was the dissolution of state/government part inherent to communism that had me confused to the difference between the two.

The US government can't force pools outside US borders to register. They can however try to influence other nations into same line of thinking. I think we'd see some solutions if that ever happens.

Well, I obviously don't know everything here, but from what OP has told us I think it is highly unlikely that the bank is allowed to reverse the transaction.
I mean, it is not his fault that the bank account was hijacked and he should not be liable. As I've said I don't know UK law, but considering they're required to follow EU directives I cannot imagine they can do this at all.
If there's any low threshold mediation service for customers of financial institutions in UK, I highly recommend filing a complaint with them against the bank.

This is a spot on perspective on sudden and larger movement in percentage on Mt.Gox. While it may not always be true, but a surge of new users are likely to head to Mt.Gox than Bitstamp, and it is simply easier to having funds deposited to Mt.Gox than withdrawn. Right now I got $1 000 deposit stuck in limbo to Bitstamp.

Because of the extremely tiny liquidity in Bitcoin it is easy to manipulate the price levels. If Bitcoin one day becomes mainstream or reaches to a reasonable and sustainable amount of the world's population we will see liquidity closer to the traditional forex market. I'm sure you can imagine how much harder it is to manipulate a nation's currency than Bitcoin by trading alone.
1. If you're comparing to drilling oil you will also have to assume that as soon as 1 drilling company stops drilling, it becomes easier/more profitable for everyone else to drill. This is how drilling for oil or mining for gold differ from mining for Bitcoin. In addition the fee will eventually be set by a free market. The only real issue I could imagine on top of my head is that the security of the hashing network might be reduced and possibly manipulated. I haven't looked closer at this aspect or even consider it a real risk.
2. If we were to assume some sort of wide spread Bitcoin usage in the future the price will appriciate a lot more than what it currently is. The current price speculates heavily on prospects of future utilization of the Bitcoin protocol. This is what makes Bitcoin a high risk speculation vehicle compared to more established technologies. Mainstream adoption would stabilize the price far above $100.000 for 1 Bitcoin. 
EDIT: Just to clarify. I predict above $100.000 in price levels (ONLY in the event of mainstream adoption) because Bitcoin has its nodes (or so to speak) in so many different industries and markets: Gold, Money transmittance (Visa/MC/Amex/Paypal) and remittance (Western Union/Moneygram), smart property/colored coins, banking. Now if you look at how large those markets are, and compare it to the current market of Bitcoin, the $100.000+++ estimate would be conservative in case of main stream adoption in any level.

People need to realize that if they decide to get in bed with anonymous and not public companies and/or persons they are taking way more risk than they're probably used to.
While I don't condone theft, I think users need to make sure they do their due diligence. It is misguided to put the responsibility on the Bitcoin community as a whole because someone didn't do their due diligence. Anyone unwilling to do their own research should stay away from Bitcoin.
That being said, we should pursue thieves to the extent it is possible. But what can we do if there's an anonymous user stealing Bitcoin? As mentioned earlier Trenton Shavers from Texas has been indicted, and probably rightfully so. It wouldn't surprise me if BFL was shut down and possibly even indicted as well.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:24:31
Do to its rapid adoption rate that comes with the territory. I think if you avoid and ignore those that solely care about how much their own bitcoin are worth you'll find much more interesting discussions and arguments for an against Bitcoin.
On the flipside it's difficult not feeling good about having your investment go 1 000 % in less than one year.

There's no good evidence suggesting that the banking collapse in Cyprus correlates with the April 2013 price rally.
I'm fairly confident we'll break $1 000 by 2014 though, based on the amount of development and start-ups in the Bitcoin economy. I'm still cautiously optimistic as Bitcoin tend to do whatever it feels like :)

ZipZap is not selling bitcoin. Easyco.in is, while using ZipZap as a tool to facilitate the transaction of fiat

From an economical standpoint it is impossible to list items for sale denominated in Bitcoin if you've got expenses to cover in USD/Euro/GBP/Etc.
It would not be possible to make any sensible projections based on the infancy of Bitcoin and its current inherent volatility.
There are some Bitcoin related merchant listing their products in Bitcoin. Trezor is one example. Buying 1 Trezor has gone from $50 to $900 in price for one unit. This makes this less than practical for the consumer.

I think Bitstamp could not handle the huge increase in activity and Coinbase was dependant on Bitstamp replenishing their bitcoin. But yeah, there are quite a few kinks to iron out. Hopefully the 'free market' will bring in more reliable players. :)

 most of the "oil-funds" are not deployed in the government budget. 
Sweden, Denmark, Finland etc are hardly stagnant economies. My point still stands. This was an article on Norway's stance, and I responded to someone saying Europe's economy is stagnant, which is misleading and incorrect. Whether or not oil was found is irrelevant in that respect.

When speaking of demand, we're entering conflicting economic theories. A lot of Bitcoin enthusiasts swears by a deflationary currency over an inflationary one. I'm not sure I want to go too deep in this discussion because we'd never finish. Personally I prefer an inflationary one, but I don't believe the opposite would be impossible. Otherwise I would not hold Bitcoin at all.
However, the world is heavily dependant on oil to function properly. The reason the supply is manipulated by companies and countries is that any insane increase in oil prices would cause massive ramifications over the whole world beyond the 2008 financial crisis. This risk isn't present in Bitcoin or general monetary policy, at least not in the same aspect. Oil's value is maintained by consumption of the commodity, Bitcoin is not.
There are many different kind of risks to consider when entering the Bitcoin world.

@_date: 2013-12-16 13:27:25
That is largely an incorrect assessment of the Nordic model. Take your time to research the neighbouring countries, as well as Norway before the oil and you'll notice a pattern.
While I agree that the oil made Norway insanely rich, but that oil is not what keeps the social programs funded. The Social programs are funded by tax. You'll also see how little the 2008 crisis hit the Danish, Swedish and Finnish economies as well.

I think you misunderstand pegging in this case (Or I am misunderstanding your question). Most merchants will peg it to their local currency in which their expenses have to be paid.
If you're asking which rate they're using, I would assume they're using MtGox or they let Coinbase/Bitpay operate the rate.

As per the CEO of Neo&amp;Bee work began prior to the banking collapse.
Considering the Neo&amp;Bee was not yet operating during April 2013, it's dishonest to attribute the sudden increase of value and liquidity to Cyprus at all.
I think this is a common misconception in the community that Bitcoin is somewhat widespread in Cyprus, and considering the timing of both events the connection has just been accepted without any relevant evidence to support the assertion.
Even a broken clock is right twice a day

Fair value was based on Bitcoin as a store of value. If you bring other industries into the mix you're not addressing why BofA is 'wrong' any more.

You're misunderstanding his message. Essentially you're doing the exact same thing as his friends. Hubris.

Blockchain is irrelevant when talking about VAT and capital gains.
@_date: 2013-12-16 09:01:06
I would prefer if Bitcoin had 3-4% inflation p.a.
There would be more incentives to deploy funds into stocks and other investments to drive the economy.
But that doesn't mean I dont think Bitcoin is great based on the rest of its attributes, but I see it as highly unlikely that Bitcoin will completely replace traditional fiat currency.

I didn't read the article as I've read the statements in Norwegian papers. Yes, according to the Norwegian tax authority Bitcoin is subject to VAT (25%) and capital gains (28%, 27% from 2014).

I understand you want to support Bitcoin and all, but I have serious reservation about purchasing anything denominated in Bitcoin. It does not make sense from an economical point of view. If you've already obtained the necessary funds to make it a reality, it would make it much more appealing if you adopted a transparent pricing structure, namely pegging it to a currently stable currency.
What I can tell you though, I will not buy it for $400.

I think this is a very fair assessment of the Chinese situation. A crackdown is likely to happen if this trend of avoiding capital controls continue. I think however that the Chinese government is waiting because the volume is neglible in the grand scheme of things. They either haven't had time to a properly decide what to do, or they're watching the international markets closely so they don't lose out in case Bitcoin turns out to be huge.
I think if there is a crackdown, it's going to be on the exchanges. Hopefully Bitcoin will be too big and too important for the Chinese to effectively "outlaw" it.
In terms of short term price movement, a crackdown would affect it negatively. But a Chinese ban on Bitcoin will not be end all, be all for Bitcoin.
I'm very much on the fence for what place Bitcoin has in China, but I'm cautiously optimistic.
