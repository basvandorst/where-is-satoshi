The ATM fees really are around 8%, where I am at least. $20 in 'transaction' fees to bribe the miners to actually put it through. Where's the lie?

I'm just waiting for quantum to force btc to convert to a much, much slower form of encryption, which will require more energy (mining) just as the amount of bitcoin received from mining makes it infeasible. That'll be the unwell end Buffett referred to.

how does that matter if it still depends on a few giant mining farms in china?
most of your points are comparing it to other cryptos, not 'legacy' fiat currencies. i wasn't coming from the perspective of an altcoiner, so your list doesn't really answer my question.. but the usual crap i hear is that it is 'decentralized' when that isn't really true - it still depends on a core team of developers/community leaders who make decisions for everyone else, and a set of centralized exchanges for the vast majority of transactions.

Uh are you forgetting about buying crypto? Without exchanges people are limited to: trading with cash or items in person, mining, or using ATMs (which are also connected to centralized exchanges). Face it, bitcoin isn't some utopian revolution. It requires the same shit as existing currencies, just in slightly different forms.

Man, you take this shit seriously. I better watch out!

People are only buying bitcoin to get USD out of it. No exchanges = nobody would even care.

*fails to elaborate on what makes it so great*
I'll save you the time: it's the hype and the inflation.

But duuude, you're *totally* missing out on waiting 20-50 minutes per transaction, paying 20$ **and** 8% fees to withdraw gas money at an ATM, having the value change significantly between the time you place an order and when the order is confirmed, having to keep your paper wallet in a safety deposit box (but fuck the banks amirite), and spending more time and energy worrying about price fluctuations than actually living. When you going to get onboard, bro??
