For real. Not only computers, but smart phones as well so they can transact!!!!

Completely agree. This has been my biggest argument against cryptos. They actually don’t solve any problems for 99% of the population and create more steps/complexity over credit cards. Not to mention how much the value in USD  terms can fluctuate up to 10% with a day or less. I find it ironic when people bash $ for being inflationary, but at least I know that it won’t decrease in value by 10% in a day.

It’s easier to attack with name calling instead of actually coming  up with a problem that cryptos actually solve for the consumer.

Financial freedom? Wtf does that even mean?

�� I approve of this message.

Yes. I actually think blockchain technology is going to be big in the future but I don’t think cryptos will be. I fully admit I may be wrong, but I can’t rationalize in my mind what benefits cryptos provide to the everyday consumer over using cash, debit, and credit cards. The value is unstable, it’s confusing to normal users, people earn fiat and pay taxes in fiat, energy use is outrageous, its controlled by a 100 whales, can be manipulated by whales (just look at trust liquidating mt goax coins), wallets have been hacked on multiple occasions, new cryptos are created everyday, it feels like a ponzi scheme. My background is in accounting and finance and I’ve been following bitcoin since it was &lt;$100. It’s an experiment right now and while there is a chance it can get wide spread adoption, I just don’t see the path to getting there until it fixes some pretty big issues it currently has (if it’s even possible). So as a speculative asset, sure go ahead and invest, but it’s far away from being a stable currency. 
For blockchain I think it could have many applications in contracts, stock exchanges, medical records, voting, etc.

I’d rather use my Amazon visa and get 5% cash back. Further Amazon is great with returns so no need for a third party. I’m just struggling to see how this makes anything easier for the consumer.

It’s still a huge use of energy and resources. I’d rather see that spent on developing better transportation, space, medicine, manufacturing, and other technologies rather than creating coins made up with code. Such a waste and doesn’t make humanity any better off  in my opinion.

Lol. Give me 1 advantage to using bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:14:40
It also uses a shit ton of electricity, in fact as much as entire nations. I’d love to hear from people who are pro bitcoin and climate change supporters, seems contradictory.

Thanks for further reiterating my point. You can’t answer my question so you name call. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 13:13:38
Or over credit card? I like having the opportunity to dispute a charge if service/product does not meet agreed standards.
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:01:08
Is that model sustainable? Is it practical to have a currency model that consumes so much electricity? Probably not, but I admit that doesn’t mean it can’t be done. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:02:30
I said consumer and you don’t get charged a money by hot rate if you pay it off. 
@_date: 2019-11-09 14:10:05
I had the same thought. I’m guessing OP is 18 years old I think he/she knows everything.
@_date: 2018-10-16 16:08:25
Exactly...not very powerful at all.

I think bitcoin is retarded but I completely agree with your post and have been considering buying 1 bitcoin just in case I’m wrong about how stupid I think bitcoin is��

A few off the top of my head:
Lost wallets can’t be recovered
Won’t replace fiat, I don’t care what anyone says, it will not replace the USD. For that to happen would cause massive amounts of wealth to transfer to the bitcoin whales. Look at what the US govt did when it went off the gold standard. It required everyone to turn in gold at $20 a ounce then after the US govt had all the gold it devalues the dollar to $70 per ounce. To enforce this, holding gold was illegal and punishable by up to 10 years in jail. 
While bitcoin is limited to 21 million btcs, there are thousands of other cryptos. Have read that there are potentially 4million lost bitcoins that will never be recovered. 
I think it’s currently behaving like a Ponzi scheme. As long as new investors come in to fund the previous investors exiting it works. It’s essentially just wealth transfer at this point.  I thing has been created or destroyed. 
There is likely price manipulation from funds painting trades back and forth (aka fake volume).

I wouldn’t FOMO in it. I honestly and truly believe there are huge problems with bitcoin, but realize that other people feel differently and have assigned value to it. So for that reason alone, I’m willing to put some capital at risk in case there is some level of adoption as a risk play (like gold).

I don’t mean just the value (which yes the fed does print money, but under a charter from the govt), but also through swift. That’s how sanctions are implemented on countries like Iran and North Korea.
@_date: 2019-10-03 21:35:33
You really think the US govt is going to give up control of the USD and adopt bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:16:15
It’s not wrong, I was generalizing. I understand how banks work (fractional lending, required reserves, etc). A fun thing to do is show up at a bank and ask to withdraw $50k or even $10k from your savings account. They will look at you like your crazy. The banks don’t have the cash. The only keep a small percentage. As a result can they essentially create new money through ledgers with other banks/fed. But you seem informed so I don’t need to explain it to you. 
I personally prefer a gold standard fiat, but unfortunately, history has repeatedly shown that gold standard back fiats always end with govts overspending and devaluing their currencies until finally going off the standard. Hell even the Romans did something similar overtime by reducing the gold content of their coins. 
Like I said, I fully admit I may be completely wrong on bitcoin. I just can’t see a path to adoption beyond being a risk diversification play based on other people thinking it has value. I liken it to gold. However, if bitcoin’s market cap hits half of golds, that would result huge gains, which is why I’m considering buying some. But I view it as an extremely risky investment that will either go to $0 or &gt;$200k.
