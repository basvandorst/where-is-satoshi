Fuck I don't have time for this, but I love shorting!!

Maybe I misunderstood the term 'shorting' but I do very minimal trades and acquire more Bitcoin most days through this method. Seems to be working for the last several months

Honestly, I've tried to find what has been referenced in several threads, but I have been unable to find any substantial information about coinsqaure that would be considered 'filth'

Ahh makes sense! Thanks for clearing that up. What I meant to say day trading is too exciting. Definitely not futures trading

Coinsquare and quadrigacx are good. Not aware of any registration blocks

LOL. I would say that buying the dip and hodling does include quite a bit of taking a fucking. Sometimes it's not even so quiet.  
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:35:29
We're here, just too busy accumulating Bitcoin during the dip. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:39:59
Coinsquare has lower trading fees than quadrigacx

The announcement of his death is on their official Twitter but it unfortunately links to an article on the exchanges site, which as of 15h ago, has gone "down for maintenance".
Nothing about him having exclusive access to the cold wallets.

This. But maybe try and cut the emotions out of the equation
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:24:20
This has been the best comment I've read here in a while!
If it's true though than I truly do sympathize
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:09:41
We need more lulz like this in these dark times
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:24:08
I think is probably referencing the fees associated with exchanges thinking that said method is the only way to obtain Bitcoin. 
Side note on the topic of exchanges, you don't own the Bitcoin you have on any exchange until you physically (in this case digitally) withdraw it to a wallet.

Well that's all perspective. For someone who bought in mid-December, yea 2018 is a dip. For someone in around the beggining of October, we're still at a decent high.
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:39:05
How many? Do you know?
