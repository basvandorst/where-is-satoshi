Do you guys have any sort of a "warrant canary" set up for these types of situations?

I was very skeptical when the first beta came out (it felt more like alpha!) but I'm _very_ impressed with how fast things are improving.  Kudos guys, you are shaping the world of tomorrow.

That's a good question... bitcoin is decentralized by design, but is bitcoin really a democracy? 
Every actor in the bitcoin network plays a role in forming a majority consensus on property ownership based on some predefined rules.  At first glance it does seem similar to an algorithm for democracy, where the majority of people decide what is best for the common good, and tyrants who wish to impose their will have no power to do so.  
The problem with this idea is that in the digital realm, there are no individuals.  When a majority can be bought with processors, the rich _can_ decide where bitcoin is going.  We assume that rational (economic) self-interest will keep this thing moving along (and so far it's worked out well), but though power may be decentralized, it certainly isn't evenly distributed.  In reality, bitcoin seems more like an algorithm for capitalism, and is completely independent of democracy.
The interesting thing, however, is that since it is a completely voluntary system then anyone can sell their coins and opt-out.  This is really the only check or balance to the inevitably accumulating power structures within bitcoin, if people don't like the direction it's heading (or if they think it will lose value) then they might stop using it and it will negatively affect the value.  
This sounds like a fair deal (no one is forcing you to use bitcoin), and in free-market theory you can just move your balance into a better cryptocurrency.  However, the network effect seems to discourage change and innovation for new coins, so it seems that rational people will stick with the bitcoin hegemony and hope that the rising tide lifts their rowboats along with the tankers next to them, as long as the current doesn't crash them all against the shore.

As a former Bitcoinica customer who lost 500BTC due to the hack(s) and will most likely never see it again, this is critical.

One thing I don't understand about reputation-based systems, the idea that the longer someone is reputable the more trustworthy they are... what's to prevent entities from building reputation over time to gain more and more trust, securing larger and larger deals, then once they have reached a certain trust level they betray it for one huge cash-out?

Well isn't the whole "rinse and repeat" part of the problem with any Martingale strategy?
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:26:23
ah you're absolutely correct, thanks!

It is interesting watching the dynamics between all of the exchanges.  The first run-up had btcchina leading the charge, with mtgox and bitstamp trailing behind.  This time, however, gox is in the lead, with btcchina and bitstamp tied significantly behind it.

If the mining algorithm changes to where it doesn't benefit ASICS as much, what's to prevent everyone with an ASIC from just ignoring such changes?

Is the only place to buy them by finding someone over at bitcointalk with them to sell?

The media frenzy over 3d printed weapons is being manufactured by the Forces That Be (Government, Hollywood, Bankers, take your pick) to garner support for a crackdown on information freedoms like (free speech, file sharing, digital economies).
