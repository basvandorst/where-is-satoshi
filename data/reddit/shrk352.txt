No. The scammer set up the wallet and created the paper. Then packed the hardware wallet back up. The scammer kept a copy of the paper. So when someone transfered their coins to that address the scammer had the keys to take them.

We're still in the late 80's stage of where the internet was right now. Its still early for crypto. If you had tried to make a bank transfer in the 80's on the internet you would say its way too hard for it to take off. The average person can never figure this computer thing out.  But now look at it. Average people are cashing checks using their phones just by taking a picture. The technology will evolve and make things easier with time.

The recovery sheet should always be blank on arrival. You create it on setup and write it down yourself. Any pre-populated sheet is untrustworthy and should not be used. Those words basically are your coins. If anyone gets ahold of them, or say takes a picture of them then they own your wallet. If your words are compromised you should move your coins asap.

The government doesn't recognize trades. To them You sold the bitcoin for cash, then bought the alt with that cash. The act of converting from one to the other means you now owe taxes on any gains made from the time you bought the bitcoin until you sold it to buy an alt.

My uncle says that any time I bring up bitcoin. "Yeah but its not worth anything unless you can find someone to buy it"  im like, Uhh one button on exchange and it all goes into my bank account.  No clue. Was a pyramid scheme 4 years ago and still is now.

My understanding is you owe taxes anytime you sell. The amount is based on what you bought it for. If you bought in at 1k, You paid $55 for the 0.055btc you would sell at 18k for $1000. So you owe taxes on the difference of $945.  If you bought in at 10k then you owe on $444 worth of gains. If its a 15% tax rate then in the first instance you owe $142, and the second you would owe $66. Even though no money made it to your bank account because you bought back in.

Changing to alt coins is a taxable event, to the government you sold the bitcoins for cash, then bought altcoins with that cash. In your example you would have to pay tax on all gains at the time of the sale. $250-$80=$170. You gained $170 so will have to pay taxes on that amount.

A lot of these transactions were worth pennies or less at the time. Haven't you ever thrown a penny into a fountain just for fun? Kind of the same thing im guessing.

Im really regretting selling all my coins and buying back in march. Not only did I loose some at failed day trading. It will have huge tax implications if I want to get out within a year. Hopefully this bull keeps running for a couple more months.

I'm pretty sure that's counting the payout of fee's for the block. If im reading that right there was 12.5btc mined, with another 12.5btc in fees going to the miner. If that's correct then 25btc is right around a quarter million.

Im not trying to get around them. I've just been trying to see if I have to pay them now. I tried my hand at day trading. Sold coins and bought the same dollar amount the next day. Never moved my money off the exchange. Never pocketed any money, even lost some bitcoin in the process. But apparently that was a taxable event so I need to pay for gains on the bitcoin I've held for 3 years now even though I don't have any actual profits to show for it.  Ohh and also from what I can tell im supposed to claim the bitcoin cash I received as income even though coinbase hasn't given me access to them yet.  It doesn't seem right to me. Ill be happy to pay when I cash out.

Mine gave me bonds too when I was a kid. Cashed them all in 4 years ago and bought bitcoin with them. Best choice I've ever made.

I feel ya. I keep telling myself ill cash out when i can buy myself a house without a mortgage. But if it keeps climbing id be way better off taking the loan and making payments by selling a little coin each month. I can afford payments with or without bitcoin and it still has a long way to go before im at that point.  Having a house debt free sure would be nice. But it would be hard cashing out and watching it double again.

Apparently the government doesn't recognise trading. In your example they would see it as you sold the painting for its cash value then bought the new painting for its cash value. It really seems stupid but I believe that's the way it works.

Not having a delay is a security flaw that the hackers used to their advantage. Lets say the hackers could test 1000 passwords a second and it takes them 7 days to crack. If the system was changed to only allow one password attempt per second, the user would almost never notice, but the hackers would have to wait 7000 days (over 19 years) before they could crack it.

So you can mine for an entire year and hope to get lucky. Or wait until the power ball gets high and buy 68 lottery tickets at once. Both have the same amount of dollar investment.

So...how is that any different then cash?

Second from the top, on the right, NOV 2013 to JAN 2015 it dropped 87% over 411 days. Pretty close to the same as what its doing now.

I sold 1 coin at 6000 hoping to increase my position a little bit, thought it would keep going. An hour later it was 7000. Hoping for another big drop to get back in. Stupid.
