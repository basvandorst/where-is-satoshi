It will make your shit more valuable.
Some day you will die, and then you can't create more shit. So there is a cap to how much you can make.
So by destroying some, you're raising the value. The problem is that everyone needs to use your shit. If you saved your shit and you died after making 21 million logs, then your shit would be 21 million times less valuable than if you only saved one.
But if you only have one perfectly brown shit, then all 7 billion people can't get some of your sweet sweet ass matter.
Luckily you can send 1/7billionth of a Bitcoin. You can't split your brown gold into 7 billion little peices

Yeah, that makes sense. Thanks for helping!

No, but you can still find the lost gold, it didn't leave Earth. But it's mathematically impossible to get coin back

Are you saying that people are good because if people were bad there would be more crime? Fraud will get you in legal trouble, that could also explain why there isn't more fraud.

Wouldnt that be a problem for everyday use?

If the value increases it'll attract users who don't know tons about computers. They're more likely to die with coins stuck in a wallet or forget / lose their wallet key

That's a good argument against people being innately bad. I would would say that people are innately neutral, And we can be effected by the relationship. If I someone in my close family needed something I would be more likely to then someone I hated.

What? How?

I didn't know that the LN could send 1/1000 of a sat, so that's good lol. But why don't you think many more Bitcoin will be lost?
@_date: 2019-04-29 06:00:13
Ooohhh right. If the price increases people are gonna wanna buy fewer, so the total lost will go down. Didn't factor that in earlier
