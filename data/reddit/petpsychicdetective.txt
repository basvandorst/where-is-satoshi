Saying America didn't tax citizens "at all" is extremely reductive. America didn't levy *direct income taxes* on citizens until the 1860s. Tarriffs, excise taxes and other indirect taxation has existed in the United States since the 1780s. 
The US has never been a "tax free nation," and citizens have never *not* had some form of their lives, property or purchases taxed, be it directly or indirectly.

They used to cost a whole lot less than a dollar.

Twist: timbtim, sabiWabi and bitcoinbillionaire are all the same person; their only weakness is water and they are *all ghosts*.

Getting less weird every day.

Man. Really merging the old and the new, there.

I'm sure you've been keeping *close* tabs.

I prefer to think we'll never hear from him again. And that sabiWabi will wake up confused every day for the next month, while the Billionaire Incident goes down in reddit history.

So I've been thinking while waiting in wonder for this verification. If your username is accurate, you'd have to be an incredibly early adopter. Maybe even Satoshi himself, though I'm not sure I'd peg him as keeping that much.
Either way, after weeks Bitcoin still absolutely fascinates me, especially stuff like this. This is actually a new thing, and that just... never happens anymore.

I've been watching. I see 120 on MtGox as of 33 minutes ago, then nothing else. It seems as though they've suspended something.

I said this to him, and I hope he really does come back at some point to respond -- I think this is a great way to grow the economy around Bitcoin in the short term. If new users are given instant access to a world that suddenly has an extremely high barrier to entry, they're likely to spread the word like wildfire. 
I know I'd be ten times as likely to save/spend my Bitcoins rather than cash out if it were a tip, but putting money in feels like an obligation to get money out at some point. Thinking about using it as an actual currency -- because you've essentially been given a LOAD of free money to buy whatever you want on the emerging outlets -- makes it much easier to *use* as an actual currency. If you traded USD/EUR into it in the first place, though, I feel like the modern mind is conditioned to expect an output of the same.

Honestly, I've been waiting for someone like you to appear. The way this currency could really fly is if some of the early adopters with thousands of coins jam newbies straight into the fray.
The market grows, the currency gets used. A crowd sourced, citizen's stimulus.
Edit: or, you know, millions of coins... Jesus. I have the weirdest boner. Decentralised encryption-based digital currency boner.

Trolling, honest generosity or spam, this made my night. I'm so fucking addicted to this whole culture. It's like the WoW Auction House had sex with the movie 'Sneakers' on top of a bunch of insane nerds. In a hot tub filled with blow.

Are you real??
edit: Because if you are, you may be my only Bitcoin hope. (Cue dramatic strings)
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:49:59
I'm in awe. Wish I could have gotten in on it all. I have a laptop, a reddit account and a heavy dose of regret for letting the idea pass me by when I was too cautious. I'm getting in as soon as I can.
Alternatively, a sudden 5 bitcoin from the billionaire and I'd be riding down that silk road on a jet scooter. Woooo, nootropics!
Edit: Not actually expecting anything, guys. I'm in this for reals. You've sucked me in.
But I *will* have that jet scooter someday, dammit.
