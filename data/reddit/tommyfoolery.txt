That's like saying if everyone paid their mortgages in euro they would be screwed. Cryptocurrency is still currency. 
The banks don't loan out the actual money you give them. It's all ones and zeros. All of it.

Why? How is it you can pay them in crypto but they can't give you crypto? Why do you think crypto is some magical private party only currency?
This also assumes they sit on their dicks for years and years while their stock piles dwindle.

They don't lend out coins. They lend out electronic payments.

It's all digital at this point.  When was the last time you paid a bill in physical cash?

You do know banks don't actually have to have the money they loan you, right?  They only have to have something like $1 for every $7 they loan out.

Because the laws don't say you have to have the same currency you pay a loan in.  The loan will just be paid in BTC.  Just like they can give you a loan in Euro or any other form of currency.  The base loan agreement will just be based on the USD conversion of that sum.
Person says "I want a loan" bank says "ok here's $10,000.  Would you like that in cash, check or BTC?"

lol knows the ins and outs of a detailed criminal investigation and court case, but not the main character's name.

No, just an ebay for anything and everything. 
Coincidentally, hit men fall under the anything and everything category.

In no way, shape, or form does that logic follow what I said.

I wish I lived in a world where literally the only evildoers are politicians and corporations.  Where no attack on America or its citizens has ever been from someone just fucking pissed off, it has only ever been from some underground group of powerful figures.
