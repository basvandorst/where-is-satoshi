What's the difference between blockchainlife's copies and owning one of your copies? I'm guessing it's a licensing thing?

Not sure where you got your info:
Hi Contact,
Thanks for reaching out!
We're glad to hear you're interested in our USD account feature. This is not possible at the moment, but it will be soon enough. If you haven't already, we suggest you signup for a preview when the feature becomes available.

So that means I can legally sell this digital artwork since I'm the owner of it, and use it as I wish, even commercially?
@_date: 2015-05-20 00:06:35
Really, so with Circle if I link a CC to it, and I withdraw to to that CC, it will pay the respective balance with that withdrawn amount? I use Circle so I'll look into this.
@_date: 2015-05-20 13:06:34
I asked the same question. Have you done this before? 
@_date: 2015-05-20 12:38:31
Can't be done at the moment:

Um, no.. the intrinsic value of Ethereum is precisely the fact that it's a viable smart contract platform. If the intrinsic value of Ethereum wasn't the fact that it's a smart contract platform, it would be just another altcoin, like Litecoin.  The fact that people find value in it as a store of value (currency), is secondary.

Lol, just cause the ETH community needs to come to a consensus concerning the DAO and its funds doesn't mean "everything is up in the air", ETH will continue to move forward. 
You're just repeating yourself with different words and never answered my question.
Can you explain how the community as a whole is a small group of insiders? 
@_date: 2016-06-22 12:51:24
The Ethereum foundation isn't doing anything about this, all parties involved are acting as individuals. Some of the individuals just happen to be members of the Ethereum foundation. It's their choice as individuals whether they'd like to help or not. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 05:14:24
That's the conclusion I've come to the last few days. Positive news about theDAO and Ethereum comes out, and it's nowhere to be found on r/bitcoin. Anything negative hits the front page.
@_date: 2016-06-24 13:48:43
As a holder I obviously don't have much influence besides voicing my opinion, continuing to invest in ETH if I agree with the path forward, or selling ETH and not investing if I don't. But to be fair BTC holders don't get a say in how the BTC protocol should be improved, you can say that decision lies in the hands of a concentrated group of BTC developers and miners.

Can you agree that the Ethereum network is trying to innovate (with smart contracts) in a fashion that the Bitcoin network is not? Bitcoin and Ethereum are not the same. One is strictly a digital currency, the other is a smart contract platform which just so happens to be a digital currency due to the value in the network. Please stop comparing them as if they have the same goals.
@_date: 2016-06-24 05:07:22
Can you explain how the community as a whole is a small group of insiders? I own a relatively small chunk of ETH, and consider myself part of the community.
@_date: 2016-06-22 11:11:55
Still just need a soft fork

They won't.

Just stop you're embarrassing yourself with all that spamming.

Lol you're gonna love this...from the Co-founder of Coinbase:
@_date: 2016-05-24 22:13:39
It's been awhile since I've been on r/bitcoin. Is spam like this usually on the front page? If so, glad I stayed away.
@_date: 2016-05-24 22:58:44
dogecoin duh
@_date: 2016-05-24 22:46:59
Huh? What does that comment have to do with anything?
@_date: 2016-07-27 01:19:18
Whatever you say bro. Not trying to pick a fight, just want the facts, which seem hard to find these last few days.
@_date: 2016-07-02 23:36:15
So the case is done?
@_date: 2016-07-26 22:54:34
Epiccastle8 is claiming ETH is subject to relay attacks, but vegasluna claims ETH is only affected if you try to move ETC without splitting first. If you only deal with ETH, you don't have to worry about this. I was genuinely looking for a response to this by the ETC community. 
On another note, what do you want ETH to do at this point? You want another HF to fix this issue, that apparently only affects ETC? How ironic.. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 00:16:00
I've read the whole thing and the only issue he brings up that effects ETH is the fact that contracts were deployed before the HF and have ETH in them, so it's not easy to split, but that has NO effect on anyone who sticks with just ETH and doesn't care about ETC..
So he wants ETC to be completely decentralized with absolutely no influence from the Ethereum Foundation, yet he wants them to HF ETH again to fix an issue to benefit ETC. Lol, what a joke.
@_date: 2016-07-26 23:27:58
Care to explain how this would effect me if I do not touch my ETC and only deal with ETH? I made it clear I'm not 100% on this issue, which is why I wanted a response, which I'm not getting from you.
@_date: 2016-07-26 20:56:15
Any of you ETC guys gonna respond to this?
