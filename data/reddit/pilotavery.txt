Segwit is also backwards compatible. When. You boot up an old Bitcoin client from before BCH existed, it will still work... On BTC network and blockchain. Or was Bitcoin not Bitcoin ever?

Routing can be solved via multipathing. Also, liquidity is high because you can fund a payment channel off blockchain if funding from another LN channel. This means that if everyone uses LN, there won't be liquidity issues.

Yes, well we wanted a block size increase for a while, but we just didn't want to fork it and create a new coin, fucking both markets for both coin. Plus, Bitcoin Cash was a bit rougue and also refuses to adopt Segwit now, which we want for LN. It's because Segwit with 2mb blocks are about as efficient as Bitcoin Cash with 4mb blocks (even though it has 8).
Remember Segwit2X coin? We fucking hated that too, but the difference is, since most people hated it, and it was controversial, they didn't make it out of spite. They didn't fork it, knowing it was going to fuck both sides over. They waited until the majority wanted it, which is never, so it died. Now, we are happy since WE ARE THE REAL BITCOIN! How do I know? Use an old Bitcoin client before Bitcoin Cash fork. It works on our network, but not BCH. So which is real? Heh. Ours is fully backwards compatible, therefore ours is real. We now have block size increase though, which we knew we needed, but we wanted to do it RIGHT, a fully scaleable solution that doesn't create a new coin and is more efficient than just a constant change. Now someday, Bitcoin Cash will need to make the black size increase and they will have to make "Bitcoin Cash Cash" or something. We can increase it without forking, but BCH devs don't want to do anything hard. "Complicated" means "too hard for us". And, BCH can't get LN, no atomic swaps, no smart contracts, and no instant transactions. Soooooo
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:47:45
That's not really how it works.
Segwit was a soft fork and it's backwards compatible. If I were to take you Bitcoin client from before Bitcoin cash existed, it will still work on existing Bitcoin, even though it had a soft Fork.
Are you trying to tell me that Bitcoin never existed in 2015? Because if I take that Bitcoin client from 2015, and Boot It Up, it connects fine and works fine with Bitcoin now.
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:32:29
Nope. Bitcoin is the original, the only, Bitcoin. Weather or not BCH has better technology or not doesn't matter. It's tech is technically better, and everyone knows that. We just hate BCH because I know someone who mixed them up and lost $1,000 sending BCH to BTC address, and it's because BCH website says "We are Bitcoin, but better!" etc.
We like the tech, just hate the people who are pushing it and being sleazy. If they had named it another coin, this BS wouldn't have happened and it would likely be the  or  coin.

So? promoting discussion should be a good thing. It's like banning everyone who disagrees, seriously. That's what and both seem to do. 
I am happy to debate anyone, and I am happy to upvote someone who I believe is wrong, but who is respectful and can back up claims and is not spreading false information. 
I believe it would be healthier if both sides were able to have a healthy discussion, and both sides would come out with a different point of view. Maybe if we weren't so harsh on Bitcoin Cash fans, they'd browse more, and then they'd see all the wonderful development that makes Bitcoin so much better!
I believe that at the time of the fork, Bitcoin Cash was more usable than Bitcoin, but I still (out of principal) refused to use it. Now, that's no longer the case. Most people in don't know how LN or Segwit even work, and they don't realize we now have 4MB block capabilities. It's one thing to downvote someone because they yell "BITCOIN CASH IS THE REAL BITCOIN", and I will gladly downvote. What about people who say "I prefer Bitcoin Cash, and it's not being adopted. Why is it that Bitcoin is popular if Lightning sucks because of XYZ?" If they didn't get downvoted to oblivion for a respectful and genuine discussion, just because of a different opinion, maybe we'd be able to actually inform them and change their minds. That's all. I just feel like it would be beneficial to the entire Bitcoin community as a whole.

You may hate UBI, but most would admit it's better than our current failed system.

If most people used LN, then yes, it will be usable. You leave the channel open and you can do 10 trillion transactions to anyone in the network with only paying 1 block chain transaction fee, with them paying the second. If 50% of people used LN, there would be few blockchain transactions, and then the congestion would be cut in half. LN is 100% fully scale able, while block size increase works until more people use it. You must increase it to the amount of people, while LN is 100% scale able with it's hub and spoke decentralization. Right now, the fees are 1 satoshi or so per transaction (If using a node to connect you to anyone else) but it will likely increase to 3-4 satoshi per transaction as more people use it and the network gets big enough to require 3-4 hops to reach whoever you're sending to. If you want to join the network, you open a few channels, and you will pay 2-3 BTC blockchain transactions, then pay again if you want to leave. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:25:05
Kind of, but again, the fees are so small anyway that people are bidding down. Even still, it's not "Centralized" because if every single major player failed, the network would still survive with no loss in peoples funds. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:26:17
Segwit is backwards compatible. Take Bitcoin client from before Bitcoin Cash existed. Boot it up. It connects to Bitcoin, not BCH. Good thing Segwit's 4MB blocks are backwards compatible!

Plus the client before BCH existed still works... ON BTC, not BCH.

You can't increase block size without a fork. Block size doesn't scale, LN does. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:42:06
Kind of, wouldn't put it like that.
However, existing LN software will be able to interact with the LN network, just not with all the features new LN clients offer. For example, if you don't update, you will still have the limit.
Just like if you don't use Segwit wallet, it doesn't automatically work, but it will still allow you to make transactions (Just without the benefit of Segwit)

@_date: 2018-01-25 20:53:04
It was a bit oversimplified to say the least, but these are people who say "Segwit doesn't exist because it was canceled remember?". So I really was trying to make it as dumbed down as I can. For example, sure, the original BTC client doesn't really work anymore, but the one right before the BCH fork does. Etc. I might have exaggerated a bit on some things, but it was more to get people to realize that LN is not bank owned/possible to steal funds in the middle.

It was a fork. Soft fork isn't so disruptive.
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:19:10
Correct. If every single LN hub refused to do business, you just go to the block chain and withdraw your money. Except LN hubs have no way to know what country you are in. It doesn't work like that. Your hub you are connected to, if it randomly decides it wants to close the LN channel, they can not just close it on you, you must agree. If you don't agree, They must wait the (Predetermined) timeout period you chose when you opened it. all your funds on the channel are deposited back to your BTC legacy wallet, OR you have the option to transfer it to another channel WITHOUT a blockchain transaction, then close your end of the channel.
The LN hub will charge fees, but keep in mind that they are competing with other LN hubs. Also, LN hubs actually don't have any costs anyway, so if they charge you 1 cent per 1,000 transactions, that's a break even cost for them.
If they charge 1 cent per 10 transactions, then they are making a killing, and other hubs will be lower. This is scale able.
In the end, if you really don't want to use a hub, you don't have to. You can just open a channel to anyone. If you open a channel to mcDonalds, now you can send payments to anyone, same as a hub. Except where McDonalds might charge a higher fee for the routing, it will still be dirt cheap since thee is no way for them to differentiate how many hops you're doing. But McDonalds has customers who use Chase, and Chase has a connection to Amazon, which has a connection to Amazon UK customers, which has connections to their banks, which has connections to all the banks customers, which has access to other people, banks, and businesses. 
You can use a LN hub if you want to save costs, since currently, they charge 1 satoshi (1/100 of a single penny) per MONTH (per channel) for unlimited transactions. This will only go down, because the only way to compete is to lower prices. sure, that's only a few dollars a year per 100 people, but their cost is about $2, and they still made $30 or so.
This is why. Any hub can just add more channels, and each hub can handle an unlimited amount of users, because unlike blockchain, there will be nobody wasting electricity to check hashes.
The blockchain is only used for 3 things:
1: Open a channel.
2: Close a channel
3: Send money to a LN channel from a wallet that doesn't support LN, or send money FROM a LN channel to a BTC address that doesn't support LN. 
4: To protect yourself if the other person tries to defraud you. (They wont, because you'd get to keep all the coins, which is the point. Because why would they if they know you can go to ~~court~~ blockchain at any time and get your money AND get theirs?)
5: To do transactions FROM and To a wallet without using LN. Eventually won't really happen, but even if it does, 99.999% of transactions are off the block chain which means fees should be back to around $0.10 each. Still relatively expensive, but transactions with those kinds of fees are going to be far and few.
Also, hubs don't and can't discriminate or sell data, because there is no account open with them.
It's anonymous basically. They don't know your IP address, and hell, they don't even know what BTC wallet you happen to be using, or it's address! All the hub knows is 3 things.
1: When you opened the channel, and when it's set to close.
2: How much money you put in it.
3: How many times you send money to someone through them (But not who it's to, because they just forward it to someone else which forwards to someone else which forwards to someone else)
This is not accurate, but it's a very basic simplified version.
Basically, it's like if they submit a transaction to you INSTEAD of the blockchain, and you hold on to the transaction. Then you collect all the ~~IOU's~~ transactions through the year and when you close the channel, you bundle them into one single transaction and you just did all those transactions for free. But LN is also an Escrow service, and you can't see your own funds unless the time out happens or until both parties agree to close the escrow, whichever is first. So later, when you go to the blockchain to do the close transaction, the funds are 100% there, not withdrawn and double spent, because whatever money he owes you (And therefore gave you the IOU with a digital signature for) he has to put in escrow (LN channel) first and the only way to use it for another channel is to prove (With your signed/notarized (Encrypted and private key hashed) transactions) that it was his money to spend, which means he doesn't need your private key, but he needs to show you USED your private key to sign it.
It's really hard to wrap your head around, but just know that it's just as secure as bitcoin, just as robust and decentralized, with lower fees, and still is just as easy to use.

If you have $1,000 and can afford to lose $250, and the price is $10,000, set a stop loss at $8,000 so that if it drops, you'd only lose $250 or so, and then you still have a chance to rise.

You also don't have to lock funds in channels. You can move funds from one channel to another off the blockchain. This means that if you wanted to Route transactions, and do you have one Bitcoin, you can continue routing transactions even in One Direction, but you can only route transactions up to one Bitcoin at a time. If you get Bitcoin in one channel then you send it through another, then you want to do it again, you move the Bitcoin from the channel you received from into the channel you are going to send (off blockchain) and then continue. In theory, a hub can only have 10 Bitcoin locked in channels, and be able to route infinite number of transactions instantly, only limiting the maximum transaction amount to 10 Bitcoin. Any amount of new users would not change the requirement of Bitcoin locked in the channel, because you can instantly move. Bitcoin to another Channel and do the transaction and move it back somewhere else for the next one. Realistically, the real when it comes to time delay, that it takes about a quarter of a second in order to move his funds, and so while it can handle an intimate number of users, it can't handle transactions that fast. A hub with a thousand users could probably get away with using $10,000 worth of cryptocurrency, and most transactions are going to be a couple dollars, which means it can move around freely, while the maximum transaction is going to probably be $10,000, which means that they might charge for it because it's going to take more time and more resources to consolidate all funds in that channel to that one.

Bitcoin is complicated as fuck, yet you don't know programming. And you're using it yes? 
Your phone is complicated and iPhones and Samsung are fully encrypted and hardware secured. You use fingerprint daily and you don't need to know how it works. LN is complex as fuck and only about 10% of the people in here understand it fully, but half think they do. 
But it doesn't matter, because your app will work the same. You might not even have to know LN is being used, you'd just see you have no fees. 
Don't worry, LN will be seamless just like Bitcoin is now. Bitcoin used to require you to run Linux and use a command line, then it required you to use powershell and console, then it was a program with a gui, then an app.

Bitcoin is actually very new technology, we have said quit and stuff too. The old Bitcoin client no longer works on bitcoin, because it has evolved over time. We can fit twice as many transactions into segwit of the same block size, so while our 4 megabytes locks are not 8 megabytes like Bitcoin cash, they can store the same number of transactions. Bitcoin is also the most secure right now and decentralized, just because of the mass adoption. There are more minors and more hatching power than anywhere else.

I stopped reading here, because it's totally false. LN has changed since 2 years ago and is constantly evolving. This was true at the early testnet stages, but this is false. 
Well, if they were the only people on the network, it would work this way. But fortunately, there will be about 7-8 paths to most people and you can use other channels too. 
Also, he DOESNT need to open a new channel, he can simply use a different path. Or if he has his funds locked up in one channel and wants to do another transaction, he can just use one channels funds and move to another channel OFF blockchain. That post is like Breitbart, 1/2 the facts are technically true, but aren't understood or even going to be an issue, and the explanation is totally wrong.

By that time, the TX fees will be lower. But even if they aren't, eh. I'll open 2 channels to major wallets and if one closes I can still send money to the same people. 
If that closes, I'll open a third. So 6 transactions total, for me to send infinate number of transactions in the meantime?
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:12:02
It will send multiple payments (well, you won't, the wallet will automatically split it up and find all the pathways that make the amount you want to send possible, and if there are none, it will fallback to blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:46:17
Well essentially, it's a contract between you and the government, that you will pay them to keep you secure. You have access to a court system, monetary system, roads, infrastructure, health, and thousands of services in exchange for tax. You may leave your contact at any time by leaving the USA and giving up citizenship, but this means if you get stolen from in the USA, you will be unable to use the court system, police, fire, etc. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:25:43
But you don't have to trust these hubs, it's still trustless and these hubs have no way to defraud you. That's the difference. Rouge bank or CC company can steal, even a ln hub has no way to steal. That's the difference, youre not giving up control of it, ever.

Because pretend it will always rise tomorrow. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 04:46:59
Kind of. Later, yes. When the channel closes, all transactions are totaled up to a net number and transacted on chain. If you send me $5 and I send you $10 later, then someone pays you through me, $5, our transaction will show that I paid you $10 and someone else paid me $10 on a different transaction, even though technically it's right but there were more total transactions. If we do a million transactions back and forth and end up with the same amount of bitcoins as we started with, then we'd just submit to the chain to close the channel and say we did no transactions. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:48:57
Coinbase charges like $15. The actual cost is $1 now but people need to contact Coinbase and tell them they need to get Segwit. If Coinbase had segwith (Not yet) then it would be like $1.
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:10:12
Segwit is great, but it only works if everyone uses it. If you're sending to a segwit address from a segwit, the fees are about $0.25. but everyone used it, for Network would be more efficient and the fees will decrease. I think lightning Network says the only fully scalable solution, and is likely the future of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:43:31
Maybe. If they do, then you will be connected to Amazon, who happens to use Bank of America, and some of those customers also have a chase acount that maybe McDonald's uses. If anyone implaments Ln, you can still pay them without paying directly. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:30:43
Not always, but that's what BCH is, is it not? A hard fork means the old and new versions of the coin are no longer compatible, therefore is a new coin. People can jump ship from the old coin. If everyone upgrades, great, but the block chain splits. Bitcoin is still Bitcoin, with Bitcoin Cash being a fork which now means there are 2 coins because of those nodes who didn't upgrade.
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:14:12

It means there is a demand for people to use it, and because lightning Network is going to slowly be adopted, over time more and more people will use it. Basically, it proves that despite it's current predicament, Bitcoin is desirable.

Just a tip:
Make a zip file with your encrypted wallet in it, and a Word document with the password. But instead of having the password, just ask yourself questions that only you would know on the word doc and the answers make up the password.
All lowercase.

Depends. If everyone uses LN, no, because any time you get BTC you can fund your channel from another channel off the blockchain. If everyone used LN, then Blockchain would be only.used to open and close channels maybe a few times a year per person?

??? Original chain?

@_date: 2018-01-01 09:36:26
Also, you don't even have to find a user with a channel. Worst case, it just uses blockchain in the back. It's riding on top of Bitcoin so if you try a transaction and LN can't find the address anywhere in the first 1 or 2 seconds, it will just submit it to the blockchain instead, using good old fashioned blockchain. 
It has some drawbacks, but since it is better than what we have, it means in almost cases, it will work really well, and in some cases, it won't and will just use original Bitcoin transaction. That means there is no reason not to use it. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:07:35
Hubs aren't essential, but they will naturally form. When tons of people connect to TorGuard, Torguard can route payments and basically behaves as a bona fide hub. It's somewhat optimal, not perfectly, but it's natural. This is different than being centralized though. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:56:05
This. Opening a channel cost 1 transaction on blockchain, and so does closing.
Transactions between 2 parties are free. If you have a channel open to me, and I have a channel to Amazon, you can use me to connect you two, but I will charge you a fee. I might charge 1sat, but if I was just a LN provider that just opens channels to all the major players on your behalf to connect you, I might charge a few pennies per month for the service.
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:41:40
Bitcoin Core is more the name for the dev team for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash should stop pretending to be Bitcoin. They aren't even closer to satoshis vision, because the client used for Bitcoin the day before the fork, still works on Bitcoin and not Bitcoin Cash.

Kind of, but not the same. Segwit was added without forking it. We could add a new version of segwit and it would be adopted over time, not creating a new coin, while STILL being BACKWARDS compatible with the network.
Lightning network is the same, you can make it backwards compatible... Without a hard fork... AKA changing it without a fork/Optional.
Segwit increased block size without making a fork, and still remaining compatible. So does LN. It can...

Nobody doubts that Bitcoin cash is better than Bitcoin, we just hate that Bitcoin cash principle is messed up, they won't introduce segwit which means they can't get lightning Network, and Bitcoin lightning network is better than Bitcoin cash. It was also the principle of the matter, that if increasing the block size was truly better, and was really a solution, then we should have let the entire network votes by basically either choosing to implement this or not. That means it would not be creating a new coin. It was the principle of the matter, but Bitcoin was purposely misleading and trying to pretend to be the real Bitcoin.
It's funny, it's the same developers were to have just continue pushing for Bitcoin to get larger block sizes, people would have agreed. We just didn't want a Band-Aid solution. And this actually does have downsides, like needing a lot more hard drive space in order to run in there with, while also being a lot harder on the network nodes. Lightning network is 100% scalable, wild Bitcoin cash would require you to increase the blocks more and more while the users increase. Bitcoin cash is already doomed, people already decided which coin people wanted. People want lightning network with instant free transactions, segwit, all of the cool technology, and the ability to pay with other cryptocurrencies and even to addresses of other currencies.

I had to open the channel and pay the fee. But the IP address and wallets already had a database saved. I still needed to open the channel myself. Mainnet is small and only has maybe a dozen addresses so far, but a few more are added every day. So the wallet has a list of a few LN enabled wallets I can use, or use my.own if I know the data for it. 
On Testnet, the channels are already opened. This is different. The channels were explicitly opened by me.
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:12:54
I did read it, and I ended up stopping because 1: The post is not accurate anymore, and 2: LN won't be used any differently.
Don't worry, you don't have to use LN, but I will. I'll just use the LNnetwork myself and enjoy the benefits :)
I was so happy when torguard announced LN support. Transaction fees of zero. ZERO. 2 second time to confirm, and the only difference is I use Zap wallet! I didn't even have to add or open a channel, I used the wallet and sent funds to it from Gdax and sent funds from there to Torguard. The first transaction was $7 and took 53 minutes, (Transactions have gone down some with Segwit relieving some congestion, but $7 is still ridiculous) but the second payment was free. So no complaints. I understand at first, the network is going to be small, but as more and more people adopt, less and less transactions will have a fee.

UBI check would be replacing welfare, food stamps, subsidized housing, and everything else. 
Yeah, since it's enough to live off of (with 1 roommate, no internet, a cell phone bill, and food, barely) I guess some people will, but do you really think someone making $70,000 a year will quit their job to get 10k? 
You honestly sound like some "Yeehaw" state trailer trash. I guess UBI would only work in more liberal and dense cities, where people take on 6 month unpaid internships just for the experience and resume. People here are driven, not so much lazy. It's typically the really southern states have that the issues you're mentioning. It works really well in almost every experiement, but the USA has a history of being different just to be different. Our culture might prevent it from working well. You may be a lazy bum, and since most southern people think that people who work hard become successful and wealthy, you'd think this would just drive people to work, since it would not increase taxes, and is not giving your hard earned 0.014% of your tax money to only poor people. But most people are not as lazy as you are, and as unmotivated. You underestimate the drive most people have. If you want to live in a slum with a roommate playing Xbox every day, be my guest. In fact, why don't you just do that right now? Because guess what? You'd be getting welfare benefits about 20% higher than UBI would be.
So that's total BS.
If you'd be a bum all day playing XBox with UBI, then you'd already be doing it with our current Welfare system, because well... Current system gives you even more money.

It depends on luck like Bitcoin does. There is a one in a trillion chance someone could generate your wallet, but it's next to impossible.
Keep in mind that it's not just someone you have a channel with, but basically any pathway to you. It could be you have a channel to your friend, your friend has a channel to Chase, then chase to boa, then boa to Amazon, then Amazon to Amazon UK, then Amazon UK to some distributer, and the distributer to Apple, etc. But if ANY of chase's customers have any channels to Apple, it finds a shorter route..if there aren't enough Bitcoin on someone else's channel, it can use it from.muktiple.channels. 
It's basically going to be next to.impossible NOT to have a connection with someone else. Think about roads. What are the chances that anyone in the USA has a house with no way to drive there? Your street connects to the main Street, which connects to the avenue, which connects to the bigger highways, which all connects together. Sure you don't have a direct street to me, but I'm sure you could drive there eventually by following any one of many paths. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:58:36
That's not how it works...
It's not centralized. It's decentralized, just off the blockchain. This means I can do 999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999 transactions for the cost of 2 blockchain transactions. Also, you don't need to ever close that channel. Also, you DON'T SEND YOUR MONEY TO THE OTHER HUB, IT'S STILL YOUR OWN WALLET AND YOU HOLD YOURSELF!
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:56:50
I personally will open 3 channels to 3 major players, who will route for cheap (volume) and not worry about them going down. That's just me. To be completely honest though, Lightning is great, and regardless of what the network looks like, it will behave the same and is just as secure, fast, and decentralized. 
Lightning Network is awesome. 
It looks like that now because it is a small network, but even still, Testnet looks more like a hub and spoke, with servers like "endurance" having 400 connections. If you look, the 2nd biggest hub has 66% as many as the first, the 3rd has 66% of the 2nd, and so on. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:47:38
We just don't want a hard fork. Anything that doesn't make a new coin is fine. BCH technology didn't piss us off, it's the motivation and the shit they are doing to fuck with people. If it was truly better, they should have just waited for people to adopt it as a SOFT FORK instead of making a new coin and convincing people it's the original, without fully fixing the original problem and making it scale able.
If they had released the coin under a DIFFERENT name, great. But they claim to be something they are not.

3 years ago, when I received welfare, we only got $2250 a month, combined cash and food stamps. But I also got $6,500 check to go to school ($490 which went to tuition, the rest went to fuel, books, car maintenance, a second hand laptop, and some software I needed for class). $3,000 or so would have covered all expenses, even car maintenance, fuel, and my laptop.
This isn't even counting medical benefits, and I have a $6,000 bill which I forwarded to Medical (California's Medicaid for low income) and they paid it. 
I have since started earning enough that I was able to move off of Welfare, as my Engineering career has taken off, but I doubt the system has changed much in just a few short years.
I personally would have been just as motivated with 1/2 the income, and while it wouldn't have been enough to live off of (Studio apartment here goes for around $1,500 a month) it would be enough to get by. I think current Welfare benefits are too high in most states. It's mostly the more liberal areas, like Illinois, NYC, Chicago, Maryland, DC, and denser areas that have a high welfare payout. Welfare system is important to have, and I would likely be homeless without it. As grateful as I am for it, it doesn't change the fact that paying people above minimum wage is BAD. Why would I work full time for less money AND lose my medical insurance? THAT'S why our system sucks now, and why UBI would at least be better than what we have. Anyone who would just be a lazy bum on UBI are definitely on Welfare now.
I mean, yeah, it will hurt some of the poorest people living in the most expensive areas, but if you can't afford to live there, they will either find a job now that they are given less money, OR they will move somewhere cheaper.

Lightning is 100% secure. It's secured by math, and blockchain. It's just using the blockchain as a court system, with the fine/fees being losing all coins at stake. 
If we have a channel, if we both agree to close it, it's closed. If one person refuses to close it, there is a time out of a few days and then it's closed, and the money is given out. This is just a side affect of the math used. However, if one person tries to fudge the numbers, the other person can go back to the blockchain and securely prove ownership of coins, and the other person not only doesn't get yours, but loses their own coins in the process. This, like mining, just makes incentive not to defraud because defrauding will be more expensive long term.

LN apps now exist and you wouldn't even know it's LN. Just send to an address. If it's possible with ln, you will see a 0.000001 cent fee, and if it's not, you will see a blockchain fee. As it's adopted, more and more will become LN capable. This is how it works under the hood. Bitcoin is just as fucking complicated yet you don't need to use Linux and consoles for it anymore. 
Current LN wallets are as seamless as it gets, try using one! You don't even need to open the channels or manage it, the program and wallet app does it for you! Just pretend LN doesn't exist and most transactiosn will be fee. But large transactions, like more than 2-3 btc, will have a higher chance of falling back to a standard blockchain. The more value of transaction, the more likely it will just fall back to blockchain.

Once the path is made, that's it. You don't pay fees to set up the path. You pay one fee to set up your path and leave it open and each person pays the one fee..from there, each transaction can be routed a different route without any blockchain. 
Bitcoin is like building a road in front of your car as you drive, but LN is like building a network of roads everywhere and letting infinate cars drive on it... Bad analogy but it's the best I have at this time of night, without trying to dumb it down so much it doesn't fit.

If I bought $10,000 worth of crypto at $10 and it goes up by $10, I just made $10,000. But it changes by $10 every 30 seconds now. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:01:41
If you put in $1000 when it's at $1, and it goes up by 1c, you made $10, but if it's at $10,000 and goes up by 1c, you made basically nothing. 
This is how you tell relative growth. Because when the price is that low, you want to be able to see fluctuations. You don't want it to be "1 pixel=making 10 times your investment here while 1 pixel on top is making 1%", you want it to be a consistent percentage growth chart, and this is how any financial market analyst or mathmatical would do it. Didn't you take statistics in HS? Til Most of Reddit hasn't graduated HS lol.

Feeless transactions are going to have a tough time... What's incentives do people have not to try and fuck with the network?

LN is better than Segwit.

Kind of, but it's a secure hot wallet in which there is no way to defraud either person.
LN is a hot wallet that you access via your Bitcoin private key, right?
Well Bitcoin wallets are hot wallets stored on the network that you access and make changes to using your login credentials (private key)

A user CAN in fact have open Channels. You don't need a hub to have channels open. Not only that, the average user never needs to even see it! 
Have you even USED LN? It's not complicated.
Download the Zap wallet, it's great! The great part about LN is that it has absolutely zero downsides. 
If you have a LN capable wallet, just send a transaction to a Bitcoin address. If it's accessable via any paths on LN, it will do it automatically (the wallet manages all channels for you, you just put btc in and use it like any other wallet, it will fund the channel and automatically balance it) and you will see your fees at 1 Satoshi per transaction, but now it's free!
It will take the shortest route. 
And 100% worst case, you do a Bitcoin transaction with it's normal fees. So in the real world, it doesn't matter if lightning could be better, because it has many benefits and absolutely zero cons. The only con is you can't use it to send to people who don't use Ln. The average person probably won't know their wallet supports it until they try and pay and it goes through instantly and for free. 
Can read the entire specifications for the protocol here, and it's quite cool. You can read everything about it here. 
You can fund a channel from anoer channel you have open, without being on the blockchain, but unfortunately, if you want to fund a channel from a wallet that is not a LN wallet, you will need to do a blockchain transaction to fund it. The only way around this is to use funds from any other open channels you have. It's unfortunate, but that's just how it works. 
It's kind of like how a side affect of securing Bitcoin is that a single transaction can power an average house for 5 days. It's just not sustainable or scalable in it's current form, and BCH is going to soon also as it's transaction fees are starting to creep up.
Moving off the blockchain works, using the blockchain as a court system, with the penalty being losing all your coins in the wallet. This is the next step in ensuring 100% scalability, because if you increased the block size to 100mb, it still wouldn't be scalable because again, it's a constant, and there will be a number it can't handle. 
With the internet, you could increase the capacity 10 times without editing the way IPv6 addressing works, HTTP works, etc. 
LN is the same, it's infinately scalable.

Bitcoin can't be taken down with a DDOS attack, can it? I guess you could spend a bunch of transactions, but they do cost you money. If you charge 1 Satoshi to Route transactions, because they don't require hash power, they really aren't going to clock anything out. Plus, the person doing all the spam is going to be costing themselves a small amount of money.

I don't think this is exactly how it works.

@_date: 2018-01-15 22:37:00
Well the channel cost $0.45 with segwit, but I'm never going to close that channel and will likely never pay a transaction fee again. If the other person closes it, they have to pay the transaction fee. But I'm going to leave it open so that I can do an unlimited number of transactions to not only them, but other people as well on the network. If I run out of money, that's okay, because I will be able to use a different Channel to receive payments, and I can move my money from one channel to another off the blockchain without any fees either. Funding a channel only cost a blockchain transaction if your sourcing the money from a non lightning Network wallet.
I'm probably going to pay three or four lightning Network fees to open three or four channels, and then one more fee to send one of the channels. If all of my money is in channels, I can always move the money from one channel to another without the blockchain.

Yes, well we wanted a block size increase for a while, but we just didn't want to fork it and create a new coin, fucking both markets for both coin. Plus, Bitcoin Cash was a bit rougue and also refuses to adopt Segwit now, which we want for LN. It's because Segwit with 2mb blocks are about as efficient as Bitcoin Cash with 4mb blocks (even though it has 8). 
Remember Segwit2X coin? We fucking hated that too, but the difference is, since most people hated it, and it was controversial, they didn't make it out of spite. They didn't fork it, knowing it was going to fuck both sides over. They waited until the majority wanted it, which is never, so it died. Now, we are happy since WE ARE THE REAL BITCOIN!
How do I know? Use an old Bitcoin client before Bitcoin Cash fork. It works on our network, but not BCH. So which is real? Heh. Ours is fully backwards compatible, therefore ours is real. We now have block size increase though, which we knew we needed, but we wanted to do it RIGHT, a fully scaleable solution that doesn't create a new coin and is more efficient than just a constant change. Now someday, Bitcoin Cash will need to make the black size increase and they will have to make "Bitcoin Cash Cash" or something. We can increase it without forking, but BCH devs don't want to do anything hard. "Complicated" means "too hard for us". And, BCH can't get LN, no atomic swaps, no smart contracts, and no instant transactions. Soooooo

I DON'T have money in Bitcoin Cash... Why? It's not as secure, it's not any better than BTC, and there is no adoption. 
You don't have to tell me this, I know that pretty much 2 largest mining entities together can screw with it.
And the coin currently is more similar to the whitepaper than Bitcoin, but I think that it's BS, because a BTC client right before the fork still works on BTC. If we stuck to Wright Brothers vision, we would have a Canard style balsa plane that can carry 2 people in an open cockpit with warping fabric wings (In Wright Brothers vision). 
Bitcoin development has been very careful to implament changes that have upsides without making old protocol invalid. I mean that you don't have to use Segwit.
You're preaching to the choir here, I am very aware of all the problems Bitcoin Cash has. 
*Edit: I bought BCH just for that guy I lost the bet to, knowing that he would prefer that. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:07:31
One more thing. 
If the other person refuses to close the channel, it won't close, and you will have to wait the timeout period before closing it. In the meantime, you can use that balance by transferring to another channel, but if you want to fund your channel from a non-LN wallet, you will need to do a blockchain transaction. 
Why do you need to wait the timeout period? Well it's not designed that way, but it's the same reason you have to wait 6 blocks before a transaction is complete on BTC. It's a side affect of the math and security methods used. If the other person refuses to close the channel, then they have nothing to gain, and you just gotta wait a few days, so there is no reason they won't, but it's technically possible. Still secure, but you will only have access to those funds if you move it to another channel off the blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:42:43
Kind of but not really. It can't be double spent. Imagine a blockchain that has a block time of 1 month and people use that. And once per month every transaction ever done is merged I to a single transaction that balances it and updates to the main blockchain. (This is not how it works at all, but they both are fool-proof, failsafe, impossible to defraud without extreme expense)
Btc is just as secure. They are secured the same way; by making it so expensive to defraud, it's not worth it. In theory, someone could hack Bitcoin and steal money. But they'd need about 350 trillion dollars to outpace the rest of the network with computer and electric costs for 6 blocks.

It could, but the point is that if you pay people to attack and have it, you fix all bugs on Testnet until it's secure. Currently, the only attack we know of is to ddos your peer offline and force close the channel and keep your peer offline for the entire duration of n-lock. The second they go online, you're screwed, so you, the attacker, need to keep your peer offline the whole time or you lose your own funds. That's the only attack. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:58:04

You can fund the wallet at any time though...
I don't think you do understand. You don't need to spread your funds thin over several channels. 
Why would someone have the hob host your hot wallet? Wtf? That's the fucking point of the hub. So that you don't have to do that. The Bitcoin is in your own wallet that only you have keys to and are not at Mercy of a hub. Idk wtf you're talking about. 
You will be going over multiple hops, the fastest path automatically. Your transaction is measured in bytes. It doesn't take long to broadcast 1/2 a kb to the network. Also, Bitcoin works the same fucking way, because the internet works the same fucking way, hub and spoke. Only this time, it's not hardware, so you aren't limited to 1 isp, but any isp in existence. 
Idk how to simplify it more. I'm an electrical engineer, and a software developer. While I don't work for Bitcoin. Or LN, I do understand it, and it's clear you don't. 
Liquidity will be exactly the same. You just put all your coins in maybe like, idk, one fucking channel, and worst case the servers go offline permanently without reason and you have to wait a few days to get the funds back. Best case the hub tries to rip you off and now you get all the hubs coins in your channel too! Woo!
Also, if the hub wants to send you money, they can batch the transactions to refill without paying high fees. Lastly, the hub doesn't FUCKING HAVE A PROBLEM, BECAUSE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE AVAILABLE FUNDS ON ONE CHANNEL AND PUT THEM ON ANOTHER OFF BLOCKCHSIN, FREE, AND INSTANT, SO THE HUB CAN PUT MORE MONEY AND TAKE OUT MONEY FOR FREE WITHOUT BLOCKCHAIN. YES, THATS RIGHT! GASP! It will cost YOU money to fill your channel, but if you have a channel open with someone else with funds you can do an off blockchain transaction to move them to the other LN Channel. :)
Yeah, all of your concerns are invalid. So stop FUDing, or do research, depending on if you don't understand it, or if you do but just don't want it for whatever other reason. 
It's okay to not understand it, but to present yourself like you do, that's a different story.

If the other person has 0.5btc, you can still send 2btc.
It's hard to explain to a non-engineer. 
Let's say it's you, me, and frank. I'm connected to Frank, you're connected to Frank, but we aren't connected together. Frank has 5 btc and I have 10. I want to give you 5 of mine. What actually happens is that frank sends you 5 btc and I send him 5, so he's basically a middleman. Like a pipeline. Here is the issue. If you want to open up a payment channel, you'd have to place in some btc first. If you open a 1 btc channel, then receive 2, you can now send 3.  It if you open a 1 btc channel and try to send 2, it won't work. The problem is if Frank has 1 btc, and I have 2 to send to you, the max I can send is 1 btc, because he only out 1 btc in escrow for your channel, so he can only send 1 btc on my behalf. 
This is why it works more like "hub and spoke"
If you have a single payment channel to Chase bank, and Chase has a shit ton of capital to keep in a Lightning channel (escrow), then it means if chase wants to send money to someone that is connected to me and happens to ONKY be connected to me, then they would have to check that I have the funds in the escrow to send them. 
This system works if everyone just chooses a couple, 2-3 major nodes, and if each of those nodes just add eachother. If chase, BOA, Amazon, and Apple all had connections to each other with 5 million btc in escrow, it means that if 1 user sent 1 million btc to a friend via Chase&gt;bank of America&gt;friend, then it would now say I paid Chase, chase paid boa, and boa paid friend. This means the channel between chase and boa changed, and now the open channel is 4 million btc for one and 6 million for the other. If a DIFFERENT user on boa sends money to a DIFFERENT user of chase, boa still is sending chase money via that channel on your behalf, and now it's balanced out again, and the payment channel is matched. 
It's just like that. "I send a check in the mail for your sister, can you please just give her the cash now then cash the check? Oh shit, you only have $6 in cash, you can't do that transaction for me. I guess I'll just send it to them directly (via old fashioned block chain).

They could duplicate it at any time. But if they try and defeaud you,  you use the ~~court system~~ blockchain, and then you keep your money AND theirs. Sure, there is a chance of succeeding, but they'd have to lose the coins in the channel 1 million times before it's possible. This is why LN talks about the other party having at least $1 so it will not be worth the 1 in 100,000,000,000,000 of succeeding, since each failure, they lose all funds in the channel. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:47:26
The internet has MANY hubs. Comcast, Cox, Time warner, etc. 
My point is that Bitcoin LN will have many nodes with LOTS of connections people use, but it's not going to be like an ISP where you have one option. You can compete on price, it's source routed, and it's still just as decentralized. A highly connected node is pretty much a "hub", except that there is still no point of failure. Because if everyone has 2 channels open, there will always be at least one other path if any one node goes down. 
They will naturally form, but this is OK. It doens't mean it's centralized, it just means it's easier and more efficient to connect to nodes with high uptime, who is well connected, giving fewer hops. As long as there are 30-40 different hubs/highly-connected-nodes (Which there will be, just like testnet) lightning will be fine. Even if it wasn't, Lightning would still be fine. It's next to free, and instant. There is basically no downsides, because the only downside is if you want to use it to send to someone without LN, you can't, you must use Blockchain. Which is what we do now. And by then, mass adoption of LN means BTC transactions will be cheaper.

Yes, but most people won't have more than 3 channels open, and likely not for that amount. I do know how that works. Realistically, even if it doesn't go through, a transaction that size is going to be perfectly acceptable on the blockchain.

Yeah, all shitcoins have cjepa transactions because nobody uses it. Bitcoin Cash has 200kb blocks most of the time because it's just so fucking empty. Sadly, I can't buy KFC, Pizza, or even Amazon items with BCH. Bitcoin Cash isn't really all that useful now. It may be cheaper than Bitcoin (although it's also bad for nodes without the hard drive space) but Lighting network will be instant, free/next to free (I paid $0.0003 for an instant transaction) and also very fast. Since almost all nodes are in China now, I don't want to use BCH. If they can claim to be in Satoshis vision, why would they change something? And, on top of that, why pick and choose? No segwit means no lightning, which means no free transactions.
You can't use BCH at a coffee shop, or you'd have to wait for a confirmation. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:12:03
You'd pay one Bitcoin transaction to open lightning channel and one to close. You can do infinate transactions in the meantime.
Fees with lightning differ. If you're paying the person directly, no fees, period. If you're paying someone via mtiple hops, you would just pay via the lowest cost/path to them, pay a fee to the middleman. 
In this case, 1 Satoshi (0.00000001 Bitcoin) per month fee for unlimited transactions for the first LN channel.

Yes, well we wanted a block size increase for a while, but we just didn't want to fork it and create a new coin, fucking both markets for both coin. Plus, Bitcoin Cash was a bit rougue and also refuses to adopt Segwit now, which we want for LN. It's because Segwit with 2mb blocks are about as efficient as Bitcoin Cash with 4mb blocks (even though it has 8).
Remember Segwit2X coin? We fucking hated that too, but the difference is, since most people hated it, and it was controversial, they didn't make it out of spite. They didn't fork it, knowing it was going to fuck both sides over. They waited until the majority wanted it, which is never, so it died. Now, we are happy since WE ARE THE REAL BITCOIN! How do I know? Use an old Bitcoin client before Bitcoin Cash fork. It works on our network, but not BCH. So which is real? Heh. Ours is fully backwards compatible, therefore ours is real. We now have block size increase though, which we knew we needed, but we wanted to do it RIGHT, a fully scaleable solution that doesn't create a new coin and is more efficient than just a constant change. Now someday, Bitcoin Cash will need to make the black size increase and they will have to make "Bitcoin Cash Cash" or something. We can increase it without forking, but BCH devs don't want to do anything hard. "Complicated" means "too hard for us". And, BCH can't get LN, no atomic swaps, no smart contracts, and no instant transactions. Soooooo

@_date: 2018-01-24 22:09:52
Because BTC fees with Segwit (Segwit has 4mb blocks) are $0.50c, and BTC handles 10 times the transactions. LN is fully scaleable, and no, it's not centralized any more than Bitcoin Cash is. (Neither are). If Bitcoin is centralized with all the miners, then Bitcoin Cash is with 97% of hashing power owned by 3 buildings in China. 
We wanted a larger block size without the downsides of making a new coin. We hated Segwjt2X fork for the same reason, so it didn't happen. It's not just Bitcoin Cash, it's all forks who pretend to be something they are not. Segwit 2X would have to be forced to Segwit 4X. Now that we have the capability of increasing the block size with consensus, we don't need a fork! :)
Bitcoin Cash can't be used for micro payments because it still has a 10 minute block time, just like Bitcoin does. These were limitations on BOTH coins. And while zero confirmation transactions are possible, they are not secure. And they are even less secure on bitcoin cash because they have much less hashing power.
Yeah... No.

You can fund one channel with another if you chose to without blockchain. Also, you can refuse to route anything that depletes your funds, or even charge a fee for it. Open 3 channels to major wallets and then problem is solved anyway since you can fund one channel from another off blockchain. 
Each node can choose to route it or not, but can't see the whole path and can't change the route. You, the sender, gets to look at the fees beforehand and choose the best route yourself, and nobody else can change the routing.

Nope, not at all! :)
You don't understand how LN works. 
None can or will be reversed. It DOES get finalized on the blockchain. 
Basically, they give you a pre-signed transaction that you can prove they sent you money. No money is reversible, it's JUST as secure as Bitcoin. If someone wants to reverse the transaction, you both sign the transactions and then submit it to the block chain when you close the channel. 
By "Dispute" it means bring all evidence to the blockchain. You can PROVE they sent you money, because you have an encryption key, you have proof they signed the transaction. 
They have zero proof that you sent them the money back.
What I am trying to say, is "Disputes" won't happen because there is no point.
If I send you 5btc, then you send me back 5btc, but then you try and and lie and say you actually didn't send to me, I can just take the transaction (With your signature form your private keys) and show that it is not legitimate.
This is like saying Bitcoin can let someone steal all of your bitcoins in your wallet. Which it can. But for 1 person to steal your bitcoin, they need $355,000,000,000,000 in electricity costs alone, let alone the computer required.
Same with LN.
It's hard to explain in lay-mans, because LN is even more complex than BTC and just as secure.
But yes, it's secure, or else nobody would even use it and it would have died a long time ago.
NO, THERE IS NO WAY FOR ANY PAYMENTS TO EVER BE REVERSED ON LN, EVER, PERIOD! SAME AS BITCOIN!

@_date: 2018-01-11 06:24:44
No, because you have a signature showing you had the first transaction. The other person has cryptographic proof you sent money first, and then they'd go to the blockchain judge court system which would realize you're a fraud, take the other person's money and give it to them. Then they'd take all fo your money in the channel and give it to them too. So don't even try, it won't be worth it. 
I guess out of spite you could. If you are willing to give up your coins, they'd need to wait a timeout period. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:33:00
Good question!
It depends. If it's the original chain, sure. If there is no fork, sure. Although my metric is mostly Consensus. For a change to be made that would make the current client "unaware", it would require 100% consensus at the same time, or else it creates a hard fork, and then the lines are very blurred. That's basically what Bitcoin Cash is. 
For it to be a change that can be implemented over time or "adopted", it wouldn't really be changing the chain, creating a new one, and would be backwards compatible.
Basically, you are asking “Hard fork” vs “Soft fork”. 
That’s the difference between creating a new coin, like Bitcoin Clashic which became Bitcoin Cash, or not creating a new chain (Which means backwards compatible) which would be the same coin/chain. 
The answer is: The original chain will always remain backwards compatible, because any time it doesn’t, it will create a new coin as long as more than 2 people don’t update their client at the same time.
That being said, if ~60% or more moved to the fork, I would probably go use the fork, because I would like to use the chain with the most adoption and development. I wouldn’t call it “Bitcoin”, but I would use it.
Also, creating rules that make the old rules incompatible just removes a bunch of adoption. All merchants would likely still be using the original Bitcoin, and so the Bitcoin chain will always remain most popular, and new updates will remain backwards compatible.

I usually find the 7 day charts to be the most accurate. They are all using very different algorithms and are completely separate neural networks. 
For example, 3 days before it hit 20k, it predicted 19,985. I was actually surprised in it's accuracy. 
They used to only have the 7 day, but it's not very fine. It's long term. They added the 48 and 24 hour as experiemnts, but it's also using less historical data because it's harder for the computers to run. It re-calculates every hour, so it's predictions get more accurate as they approach us.

You need to make sure your node comes online at least once per month or week (or whatever the n-lock time is that you set before).

No, if you send your friends transactions, through 1 channel, when you close that channel, you only have to do one more transaction. So basically it's groups every transaction you make in that channel into only two transactions. If you leave the channel open for 10 years, then you just did unlimited transactions for 10 years for only the price of two. Isn't that amazing!?
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:15:22
The cool part is, because you can move money between channels that you control without using the blockchain, with one Bitcoin, you can routes an unlimited number of transactions for an unlimited number of users, except that you are limited to only handle a transactions up to one Bitcoin at a time. Now this is over simplistic, but basically you can handle one person's transaction, and then move the Bitcoin over to another Channel that Will be the next transaction, and you can continue doing that. This means that you really don't have to put up a lot of capital up front, only enough Capital to cover the largest transaction you want to be able to process. Although let's be real, if you're going to send $100,000 with of Crypto, you can afford to wait an hour.

Well if you cannot get your wallet online in a week or two (or whatever timelock you set), then it is possible for someone to steal your funds in that one channel. But keep in mind, they have to have confidence that you will not log back in or get back online, because the second you do, your wallet will not only get your funds, but also steal your other peers. So it has to be worth it for them. That means they have to be 100% sure that He will not come online or they will lose their funds. At the end of the day, lightning it's secured the same way Bitcoin is. By making it incredibly expensive so that any gains are not going to be worth it.

It's logarithm. 
If it is $1 and drops by $0.25, you'd panic. But if it drops by $0.25 now you think it's not a big deal at all. 
This is how any analyst or anyone who needs to view data would view it. No sane person (who knows what they are doing and wants to extract real useful info from it,) would use a linear scale.

Yes, I mentioned that. TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION IS THEFT!
This is EXACTLY what I mentioned before, the USA requires I pay federal income tax as long as I am a citizen. THAT is theft because they don't provide any services other than Embassy, International Security, and International Judicial services (imagine getting locked up in Chinese prison) all of which could would be paid for with like $100 flat tax a year while living outside the USA, as long as you have citizenship, which I believe is reaosnallble... But the taxes they want are too high. I think that specifically is bullshit, you're totally right. I'm going to be moving to Toronto Canada soon, and that's exactly what I mentioned. Solution? Give up USA citizenship!
Taxation in general is not theft, but the USA doesn't give you many outs. At least in Europe you have a European passport and can pick up and move wherever you want. Although again, you're free to move to any other country (most EU countries accept citizens of nobody) or anywhere that doesn't have tax. 
Yes, you can drive to Toronto (50% immagration population in Canada's largest city) and get a job and get citizenship really fast, even faster should you give up US citizenship.

Yeah, I know. Just because it's nostalgic doesn't mean it's better. But the point is, you don't HAVE to use a multisig wallet. Bitcoin is Bitcoin.
I hear this a lot: "Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin are neither the original chain, since BCH increased blocks and BTC got Segwit.
Well... since at the time of the fork, only one branched off, and that was BCH. Therefore we are the original chain. 
IDK. I can see where they are coming from with the Whitepaper thing, since Satoshi did mention someday a block size increase would be needed (They did it without consensus though) but IMHO it's like people who refuse to use digital aond only use Records. It's just the Nostalgia.

And I am aware Bitcoin Cash is struggling to keep up since Segwit. Bitcoin Cash is rarely used for transactions, other than moving between exchanges or wallets. That's why it's empty, and why it's so cheap.
But still, if Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin had the same amount of transactions, Bitcoin Cash would have similar fees to Bitcoin, without Segwit. Bitcoin is more efficient, but I think it's kind of like CD vs Records. Some people just have a nostalgic purist view on it, and just like it because of that (Or because they can understand BCH but LN and Segwit is too complex for people to keep up).
I believe in Bitcoin, and I know Bitcoin Cash is going to go the way of the DogeCoin eventually (Especially refusing to adopt any new tech).

Never heard of Bitgo, and frankly, I am too tired to read tonight. I bookmarked it on my "read later" list. 
You can "rent" by closing a channel to anyone who doesn't pay you the fee. But unlike ISP, you can choose any Provider on the internet for this. This means there will be a fair market with different providers (for those who want to use them) to bid for service, but because it's source routed, it's completely neutral. That's the best part. They simply charge a flat fee per route (1 Satoshi or even .1 satoshi) or they charge monthly to keep a channel open (and are incentivized to charge a low cost because if they close the channel, they pay the fee, not you, and they want you to stay on their routing service)
Lighting network is the best thing to happen to Bitcoin since Bitcoin. 
I'm a developer, but not for Cryoto. That being said, I believe I have a decent grasp on how it works on a technical level, but while I have taken macroeconomics before, understanding how financial motives work is a bit complex for me, I admit. 
Lightning network, after it's done being developed, won't really have any real pain points or downsides. To the average user, they will use it like they have always used Bitcoin, except the transaction will be securely completely confirmed and complete in under a second (about 250ms, 750ms max) and they will pay fees so low, it will be measured in hundredths of a penny. This makes micro transactions (coffee buying) truely possible, for the first time.

If you open one channel, you are doing one blockchain transaction. 
If Top Channel happens to be to Chase Bank, anyone who has a channel to Chase bank, you can send money to. Then bank of America and Chase might wire money, so hey have channels. And then you can send money to anyone who uses any of those two Banks. And then any of those users that work with Amazon, now you can send money to any one who has an Amazon channel open. You are supposed to set up your payment Channel, maybe two or three major players, and then leave them open.
It's quite a good system. Now, you can send money to anyone who is involved in the LN, paying 2 blockchain transaction fees. Also, because you only do transactions to open or close channels, fewer transactions on the blockchain means lower fees.

Basically, Lightning network moves transactions off the blockchain, but uses the blockchain as a moderator/court system. If there is any dispute, either person can bring the channel to the blockchain and the person who was doing the fraud loses all coins in the channel, and the person who was being defrauded keeps all coins in the channel, theirs and the other person. This deterred people from even attempting to defraud. Opening a channel, some people may only choose to open a channel if the other person puts in $5 or something small just to have some reason not to try.

Taxes are fine, I will pay tax gladly. I just wish I would choose not to spend $611 on a new submarine last year.
But Taxation without Representation is exactly why the USA broke away. If you are a USA citizen, AND a french citizen, and you live in france, have property in france, and you done even have any assets, business, etc in USA, as long as you're a citizen, you will still be required to pay federal income tax on all your income, yes, even if you don't have a business, assets, income, or even family from the USA.
Taxation without representation is theft. This is the only country to do so, the USA.

Increasing block size fucks up the market on both because it requires you to fork it.

No, it's buggy because nobody has made an app or program that works with lightning Network well yet, and most of them are not complete. Some of them crash when trying to send money, and send it to half an address, and the suns are lost, and some of them might chest not recognize a double spend correctly, or a forced Channel close correctly, and let the other person take their funds instead of claiming them.
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:27:09

@_date: 2018-01-25 10:27:28
Exactly what I said. As long as each has more than a single channel, the network won't go down. Lightning is not a fragile network by any means, it rides on the security of blockchain. It's secure, fast, and robust. 
But even though Testnet is a "hub and spoke", there is still no single point of failure to anyone with at least 2 channels. 
This is why Lightning is so great, it's fast, without compromising robustness or security. 
Yes, routing to 3 major hubs (TorGuard only charges 1 Satoshi to route at the moment on the mainnet, and agreed to be a Ln Provider)
Anyone wanting to send $10,000 transactions will likely need to use larger players, since they are the ones with the capital to route it. It isn't a big deal since they can shift coins between the channels, bit if I want to send a 1,000btc transaction to you, I must route it through someone who has that capital available to let me send to them so they can send it then shift mine into the other channel to balance it. Although realistically, it's not a big deal either, because small transactions are plenty, but if I'm sending that much money, it's likely for a car or house, and I can afford blockchain fees and the 1 hour wait time.

Normally I would vote this just because it promotes discussion, but this is complete misinformation. It is actually just a secure on bitcoin and Bitcoin cash, all else being equal, except that Bitcoin has more than 30 * a hashing power. Which means it is30 * a hashing power. Which means it is more secure.
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:29:45
No, you don't need to know what users have what channels open, the network handles that automatically.
You, the user, would type in the Bitcoin address you want to send to. If they use LN and your wallet supports it, it can automatically hunt for them on the LN and know if they are a LN user or not. If yes, great! If not, it just automatically falls back to the blockchain. 
You can have an I finate number of payment channels open, but limited by your balance. I'll explain. If any user has just one channel open, they are likely connected to the whole network. It's more like a hub and spoke system. Sure, I can open a channel to you and if you don't have any other channels, we are not connected to the global LN. But as soon as either of us connects to anyone big, or anyone small who happens to connect to someone big, we are connected. Most users are best just to open a lightning payment channel to one or two big companies, and then leave it to that. 
In order to open a payment channel, you must put Bitcoin up. It's kind of like in escrow. If you want to open a payment channel to Walmart, it's kind of like a secured credit card or debit card. You put in 100 Bitcoin into this Channel, and you can close the channel and withdraw your money, with a time delay. It is still just a secure, and you can get the Bitcoin back into your wallet off of the lightning Network. But if you want to have a $100 spending on it, you would put up $100 in Bitcoin, and then if you wanted to send money to Walmart, you would just spend some of the money already in escrow. If your friend wanted to send you money, but does not connect to you on Lightning, but you both are connected to Walmart, Walmart is receiving some money on one payment channel from him, and then using a separate payment channel to you in order to pay you. They would charge a very small fee in the middle, but this would be like 1/1,000 of a percent. 
However, if Walmart only puts up a $100 payment channel to you, which means they can only spend up to $100 before they have to open a new payment Channel. Or, they have to receive money from you that they can spend back later. Basically, if your friend wanted to pay you using Walmart to connect you to, but Walmart only put up one Bitcoin, then the maximum your friends can send to you is one Bitcoin, because Walmart doesn't have enough to pay the entire amount. In this scenario, it would all back to the blockchain, and you would just be doing a standard block same transaction. Keep in mind that blockchain transactions will be cheaper because most traffic will be moved on to lightning Network.
The best part about lightning network is that it's 100% backwards compatible and forwards compatible, and it does not Fork Bitcoin. It does not create a new coin. If you send money to a Bitcoin wallet from a lightning wallet, it will still send. If they use Bitcoin Legacy, without lightning Network, then it will just go to the standard Bitcoin transaction. If the payment channel is not sufficient, then it will just fall back to blockchain. Most users will be best off opening one or two payment channels for very very large amounts of money, but does peanut channels should go to huge popular nodes like Chase or Amazon. This means that it has the most number of people and the most number of connections to other Banks and nodes of large size. 
The problem is, if you put 100 Bitcoin into your lightning Channel, it will allow you to send up to 100 Bitcoin, but that Bitcoin is actually removed from your wallet and cannot be spent elsewhere, except for that specific payment Channel. You can open Channels with another agreeing party, and close them at will.
Everytime you open or close a channel, it's doing one blockchain transaction. If you try to close a channel in the other person does not close it, then you will still have your money, and the other person is inconveniencing you, because the money will be locked into your payment channel for a couple days until the time out expires and it is released back to you, and that's the only downside. However, this is not likely to happen, because the other party received no benefit from doing so. If you want to close a channel, and they refused to sign the transaction, then you will have to wait to get your money, but that's just a side effect of the mathematics and cryptography.
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:26:23
But again, this is at Alice's expense. At the end of the day, it is secured the same way Bitcoin is, by making it incredibly expensive to defraud the other person. If somebody has a trillion dollars, they could easily spend that much money to buy supercomputers and electrical supplies in order to have enough hash rate to do something malicious to the network, but the games are going to get from it is smaller than their expense. The thing that secures lightning is the same as Bitcoin. Sure, somebody could attack you this way, but it's going to require much more expense than game. This makes it unfeasible to do, except for proof of concept. Also, this has high risk. One of the ways to mitigate this is to refuse to open a channel in which the other party has not funded their part. While lightning allows you to open a channel without funding one side, if you only open the channel with peers who put in at least five or ten dollars worth into it, it is a deterrence.

It's being held back because it's not as simple to use as PayPal yet, then after it became easy, the fees are high. A LN wallet is used the same as a legacy wallet, and all channels will be handled automatically. You don't have to worry about locked funds, etc. You just use it like normal except all transactions capable will be free or 1 Satoshi or cheap, and any person not using LN will just do a blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:18:13
I use Segwit for all my transactions. About 60, or 4-5 a day, they are $3.00 on a bad day and $0.50 on a good day. So not too bad. LN requires Segwit. BCH fees are low because their blocks have like 400kb blocks now since nobody does real transactions with it. And nobody accepts BCH so I can't use it as currency on Amazon or Gas station or restaraunts I go to. A few of the franchises here accept Segwit transactions, so I am happy to pay $2.25 or so on top of that for the convinience. 
Bitcoin Cash was better than Bitcoin, but I left as soon as they decided not to support Segwit because "satoshis vision" because... If they change the black size, surely they'd be willing to add it? Nope. BCH isn't doing any real development. And since BTC transactions are about $2.20 ($1.00 on weekend nights and $3.00 on daytime Friday) I haven't felt a need to even try and hope any merchant takes BCH anymore. 
I'm fine paying even $9 for it TBH. If I was using good-old-fashioned Bitcoin, sure, but luckily, since LN requires Segwit, the other peer will always have segwit too, which again, ensures every single transaction will be using it to open and close channels. 
Also, BCH doesn't have instant transaction confirmations to allow me to recieve money and send it instantly immediately like LN does.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:22:25
To add to what said, if someone tries to defraud you, you get to keep all the money in the channel, including the person who tried to defraud you!
Basically, this just moves transactions onto a new layer, and only uses blockchain as a court system, or a judge/moderator IF there is a dispute. If both parties agree to the balance, all is good. If one disagrees, then either can take the ~~evidence~~ cryptographic proof to the ~~judge~~ blockchain, and the winner in court gets all funds in channel, even the other person's! So nobody will try and defraud anyone, because even though there is a chance to succeed, it's not worth the risk. 
Same as how Bitcoin works.  Sure, there is a chance to solve 6 blocks in a row with 6 tries, but it's infantesmally small. So to steal someone's wallet, your statistical chance shows you'd spend a trillion in electricity costs to steal the wallet. Etc. 
Bitcoin, and LN, work by decentivising people from attempting to fraud by making it incredibly expensive so it will never ever be worth it. 
Sure, someone could do a fake transaction, but it would probably cost a housand times more than the profit. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 04:19:20
0.17? That's exactly 1/4 of the arbitrary agreed on limit set by a couple of the devs. Isn't that the limitation at the moment in software wallets, not the actual hard limit? LN, protocol works with 1024btc at a time, or down to zero. But most Testnet apps make you put some in also.

We didn't want to fork into a new coin. Bitcoin vs Bitcoin cash? Well Bitcoin vs Segwit2X would have caused the same fight. The difference is, people argued, so it was too controversial to continue. At least this doesn't make a new coin and fuck the markets on both.
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:20:27
Nah, it's that you can't generate value from nowhere. Forks mean people have to decide which one to adopt, creating more fragmentation and fucking the markets on both because value needs to be made somehow.
Instead of doing that, why don't people VOTE or which they want by implementing it that doesn't create a new coin. Segwit, LN, or anything else will do that isn't a hard fork.

No, that's not how it works. With LN, only you hold your private key, period. You don't have to use a hub. You could connect to 8 random individuals and it would probably work fine. 
The wallet had some channels set up, but luckily you can choose to open it yourself. 
Also, that's exactly the reason why I used GDAX to send the money to my own offline wallet, because it's free. Also, limit orders are always free., Zap, which supports lightning. If my hard drive crashed, the money is gone! (Except I have a backup)
Nobody has those funds but me. They are not in anyone else's control. 
If coinbase doesn't set up a channel to Torguard, so what? If any one of coinbase customers have a channel, I can still send money. Or if any of the customers from any other company coinbase is connected to also is, then I can then also. So that's a BS issue.

Well yes, and I think being the first to Market is why it's not going to fail. It's like the original OG. I think that Bitcoin is still going to be valuable, but it's not going to be a currency. It's kind of like how you can have $25 in gold or $25 in dollars, but people who are just hoarding it in order to keep it in there safe will likely stored as actual gold or silver. It's kind of like that, I'm willing to buy and hold Bitcoin, even though I know it's not really going to be a currency. I believe that Litecoin is likely our next actual currency, and I'm pretty sure that Litecoin is likely going to be the future. Of course, there are many others that will still be around and useful, such as Ripple, which is likely going to be used for banks to use as a replacement for the credit card system, or salt which is going to be a lending platform.

I know people who are in constant pain, needing medical prescriptions they can't afford, or stealing napkins from restaraunts to use for Toilet paper, eating top ramen every day. It's not sustainable. The first thing they will do is use that money for a toothbrush, shampoo, soap, sponge, rice, noodles, soup, bread, and other basic items. Do you think a starving homeless man would put it in a savings account? Nope, he'd use money to eat every day until it ran out, then go back to begging.

It's not any more communist than our current welfare system. In a way, it's less, because instead of "leveling the playing field" by only giving to the poor, this is universal, to everyone... So I guess by your definition, the USA is already a communist country. You are starting to sound like the average Trump supporter.

No, I am marrying my fiance because I love her. We are doing the wedding because of tradition and fun. We are getting a marriage license for $80 so that I can file taxes as a joint file. Plus it will be easier for me to obtain Canadian citizenship so I can give up USA citizenship. 
I disagree with the statement "taxation is theft", but that's your own opinion, so there really isn't an argument I can make against an opinion. I am happy to pay taxes for the services I receive, I have access to police, court, fire, roads, schools, etc. 
I think taxation without representation is theft. If I moved to the UK, as long as I'm a US citizen, I must pay federal tax, including income tax, even if I have no property, income, or residence in US territory. My opinion is that this is theft, although I understand it's purpose to prevent loopholes from people moving away and exporting goods back to the USA. I think the tax is theft, since they are not giving me any representation, any access to the court system, nor are they providing any roads, protection for common carriers, regulation on health and drugs, or anything to me in return in this bona fide contract.

It's not going to cost $4.3 trillion dollars. Do some research...
It will cost less than our current welfare system. Of course, senior citizens will actually have their income lowered, and the poorest who are currently on welfare will be receiving much less, not even enough to live off of. This means that they would either have to move in with two or three roommates, or get a job.
Every American citizen age 21 and older would get a $13,000 annual grant deposited electronically into a bank account in monthly installments. Three thousand dollars must be used for health insurance (a complicated provision I won’t try to explain here), leaving every adult with $10,000 in disposable annual income for the rest of their lives.
The UBI is to be financed by getting rid of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, housing subsidies, welfare for single women and every other kind of welfare and social-services program, as well as agricultural subsidies and corporate welfare. As of 2014, the annual cost of a UBI would have been about $200 billion cheaper than the current system. By 2020, it would be nearly a trillion dollars cheaper.
A UBI at this level is actually cheaper than the current system.
The other two issues we get rid of are firstly, the minimum wage. If everyone’s getting a basic income then we don’t have to ensure that wages create a basic income. Thus involuntary unemployment will disappear. Simply because there always will be jobs at some few dollars an hour if people do want to do a little bit of light work here and there to top up that UBI. And no, we won’t see people being taken advantage of: for the UBI actually raises the reservation wage. If you’re already getting near $1,000 a month then the amount someone has to offer you to go to work rises, doesn’t it?
The second is that we’ve just reduced the tax and benefits withdrawal rate for the poor. Just as with the Laffer Curve argument about the rates of tax upon the rich (note that the Laffer Curve is true, the only argument is about where the rate is, not whether) it is also true that too high a marginal tax rate upon the poor will reduce the desire to work. The US does not suffer too much from this problem but the UK definitely does. There’s millions of poor people who face marginal tax rates over 60% if they work just a few more hours a week: some over 100%. This comes from the income tax system starting quite low and the various welfare benefits tapering out. The two together can combine to create those 60-100% marginal tax rates.
So some people would indeed just stay home as they’ve not got an income. But we’ve also got these other forces going the other way. We could in fact see an increase in labour hours as a result.

It's really easy, you just export your private keys, or export your wallet, and import it right into the fork. For example, if you had a ledger Nano s with Bitcoin on it before the fork, you would just export your private key from that, if that's even possible, I'm not sure, but anyway, you would export that key, and then go ahead and import that she into Bitcoin cash wallet.

No. It doesn't involve a cashless society. It doesn't involve a stateless society. It is classified as an alternative welfare strategy. Therefore, not communism. 
"Communism" was historically defined as a stateless, classless, money-less social system, so there's no government by definition.
Saying that this is communism, just shows that you don't know what communism is. Simply put, communism is a system in which the means of production is owned by the state, not the people as a whole. Socialism is the opposite, and it means that the means of production is owned by people as a whole. Socialism is a very broad term, so I can't say that I like or dislike socialism, but in general, most people in United States are actually socialist. Capitalism is actually under socialism. Capitalism it's still a system in which people actually owned businesses in corporations, not everything is owned by the state. 
Unfortunately, and this proposed Ubi program, because it also replace the state pension and Medicaid, it's going to require a lot more legislation in order to change then just replacing a welfare system. In the end though, it would cost less money. There's no doubt about the cost, the argument is whether or not it would work. It's way too complicated to tell if it will work or not, but at the moment, there is no evidence to suggest it would not work, and there is evidence to suggest that it would work. It just depends. Do you favor giving money to people who need it more, or would you favor just giving the same amount to every single person regardless? I personally think that our current welfare system is going to benefit everyone a little more, because it is only helping people who genuinely need this income, however, our application system and fraud prevention needs to be improved and streamlined. I personally would think that our current welfare system is a little better, but Universal basic income would cost a bit less. In Ontario, the Ubi program that they did their as a pilot program pretty much shows all the state at, but you also have to take an account culture. Canadian population generally has different motivations than Americans. Canadians don't steal as much, and Canadians are more willing to pay higher taxes. While Americans generally vote in favor of themselves, lowering their own taxes, which means that any tax plan is designed to benefit the most number of people, not be the most effective. Canadians 10 to vote for what they believe is going to be the most beneficial to the societies Health as a whole. This is why it's more likely to work in other countries than United States. It's the same reason why gun laws are more strict in United States, yet United States is one of the few developed countries that even have a problem with firearms and gun crime/accidents. A lot of it's just about the society in the culture, as different countries do you have different cultures. For example, I could actually see a program like this working in California, since a lot of people in California want this. But it would never work in almost any traditionally Southern State, because the culture is much different there. Libertarians are going to say they hate it, and Communists are going to say that they hate it, but to be fair, Libertarians and Communists actually hate almost every kind of government intervention at all.

A lot of experiments have shown that Universal basic income could potentially work with the similar cost as our current welfare system, but there is not really a good way to tell without doing a legitimate experiment first.
That being said, this feels more like a handout, and I think that if they wanted to do an experiment, they should give the same flat check to everyone in that town. They should also ask local businesses in that town for all of their financials. The only legitimate way to do this would be to do a medium sized isolated area. Universal basic income sounds good in theory, and I support testing it, before I can make an opinion about whether we should or not.

If I promised to give you $10 a day for the rest of your life, would you quit your job? What about $20? What's the limit? Whatever that limit is, that's what it should be set at. I'm dumbing it down a lot, because this is the best way to explain. Just because you are given money, this does not mean that you are going to be lazy and decide not to work. People will not be stuck on universal basic income, because that's the whole point. If someone previously did not work, they're not going to work anyway, and now I receiving less than they were on welfare. Now, if they get a job, they don't lose their income, which means there's no reason not to work. While there is quite a bit of Welfare fraud right now, that's not anywhere close to as many people who are on welfare but could work if they had to. The problem is, I know someone who has a welfare income, but if they get a job that pays minimum wage, they start learning more than the welfare checincome, but if they get a job that pays minimum wage, they start learning more than allowed, and now they're working full-time and still earning less than they are now. That's why people get stuck on welfare.
Universal basic income doesn't do this, because if you have a job now, this extra income is not going to make you quit your job, because it's only half as much or so as you're earning. You're going to have this extra income what you're going to put in a savings account, or maybe spend in the local economy.
Maybe it won't work because people are inherently lazy, for example, if I gave you $10 a day, it's a sure it's free money, but are you really going to quit your job for that small amount? I'm going to give it to either way, whether you work or not. 
I'm not rich by any means, I only made $70,000, and paid $19,100 in taxes. (California) but that's alright. 
And no, the whole point is it is given to everyone indiscriminately, which is the whole point. That is how you have next to zero administration costs. Ubi only given to the bottom 25% is not any better than our current welfare system.

Bitcoin is kind of a fiat currency, because it's value is derived from the electrical costs of creating it. And then, what gives it value is that people burned US money electricity bills in order to create it, in the first place. But again, that's tied to the US dollar.
That being said, Bitcoin is going to be much more stable, even if it was a full fiat currency, because rather than being Tethered to a specific entity like a government, it's immune to inflation, and because it's Global, the demise of a single country does not also destroy the currency with it.
Bitcoin is a fiat currency, but it doesn't have all of the downsides.

Well, you don't need to donate anything to it. It's funny, almost every single experiment, Universal basic income actually would cost less than our current welfare system. And so, there would not be any tax increase for it, if we replace our welfare system. Part of this is because people would be incentivised to work this way, because there's no reason not to. These people who can work will work, and the extra money will be spent locally, stimulating the economy. All of this is also taxed. Also, there are no Administration costs. They do not have an application process, and this saves cost as well. I wish we had a Ubi program, because it would actually cost me less of my tax money for it.

It's cheaper than our current welfare system in the United States, and quite frankly, would work better.

People who need the money, have it, and people who were previously getting by, now have the extra money to spend in the local economy. In both experiments, both in Europe, and in Canada, it actually lowered unemployment, increase productivity, and generated more tax revenue, while still costing less than the current welfare system. It may not be perfect, but it's much better than what we have. Of course, everybody would get this, which is kind of the point. There are no Administration costs or anything.

The UBI is to be financed by getting rid of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, housing subsidies, welfare for single women and every other kind of welfare and social-services program, as well as agricultural subsidies and corporate welfare. As of 2014, the annual cost of a UBI would have been about $200 billion cheaper than the current system. By 2020, it would be nearly a trillion dollars cheaper.
I don't see a reason not to, it's fraud-proof, no application/admin costs, and it's less expensive. 
I mean, weather or no welfare should exist is a whole other debate and that's an opinion. Weather or no anyone should receive ant financial assistance is an opinion, but UBI being cheaper than our current system, by being more efficient and less wasteful, that is a fact.

The financials work. Maybe it's not the ultra liberal "let's give everyone enough to live on" that people keep talking about, but this small supplimental income is what's going to motivate people to work. It's less than people on welfare get, plus nobody is going to "get stuck" on welfare.

Even that is bullshit, because by those standards you should be using Bitcoin Clashic, which was the first Bitcoin Cash. It is similar, but the difficulty adjustment algorithm is the original one. So if it's by whatever is closer to the first one? Then it should be Bitcoin Clashic.

It's more just about the side effect of the math used. The same reason why Bitcoin requires 10 minute confirmations... Not because they want you to wait, but because that's how it works.
@_date: 2018-05-09 16:36:27
That is all valid, except it kind of did have a field test on Litecoin. 
BCH had to hard fork again because it's difficulty adjustment algorithm was fucked by making miners mine the shit out of it at low difficulty, then abandon it, making it flip flop in difficulty. Then it forked again and added Colored Coins, which is new again. People don't realize that Bitcoin Clashic is the "satoshi's" Bitcoin cash, but the new Bitcoin cash isn't. 
Bitcoin isn't experimental, it's live and has been for a while. Of course, you can still use BTC clients from before BCH or Segwit existed, and it still works fine. 
For example, just because browsers support html5 doesn't mean the intenret now is a different network than 7 years ago.
That being said, this is not the reason why I called it a scam.
I call Bitcoin Cash a scam because it is simply pretending to be something it's not. It actively misleads people to lose money. It says "this is a Bitcoin wallet, this is Bitcoin, the other one is called "Bitcoin" but is not. Use us!"

It depends. Which one is the fork? 
If Bitcoin had a hard fork and there were 2 versions of the currency, Bitcoin with old rules and Bitcoin with new rules, the old one would be the Bitcoin. 
If a large bank forked Bitcoin and then had the majority of the hashing power, I would still call it an Altcoin. 
Soft forks don't break old rules, which means it doesn't make a new kind of crypto.

It depends on how many of the transaction are segwit
@_date: 2018-05-28 06:10:51
It didn't split, Bitcoin Cash forked off from Bitcoin, which retains the total hashing power and full compatibility with the chain before the fork. If you submit a transaction with a client before the fork, it works on Bitcoin and not Bitcoin cash, even with Segwit.

I don't know if my card is "Liquid" or not, but my card is very simple. It's metallic blue, and it has the chase logo on top right, and "Debit VISA" on the bottom right, it has a chip, my numbers, and my name. On the back, it's very basic too. It just says "Property of JPMorgan" and some phone numbers.

Imagine a congested highway. There are 2 plans to fix the congestion. 
1: Automated robotic cars that are fuel efficient, fast, safe, and allow you to use the space more efficiently. Then make flying cars so that there is space above and below you to basically commute with no traffic.
2: Build a huge road twice as big, and every time it gets full, just build a new one next to it.
Well Bitcoin Cash is a legitimate coin. It's not better than Bitcoin, but it's capacity for transactions come at the cost for centralization. However, the fix is simpler, and easy to understand. However, increasing the block size by 8x also increases the cost of running a node by 8x, in bandwidth, HDD space, CPU, and GPU. This in turn means each block can hold 8 times the transactions, but also costs 8 times the resources, canceling out. Bitcoin Cash fees are lower now for the same reason Dogecoin is lower, because the block sizes are a few hundred KB and nobody uses it now. That being said, this DID in fact increase the capacity.
Bitcoin solution for scaling involves increasing the capacity by making it more efficient. Lower block sizes mean that running a node is less expensive, and the blockchain doesn't need to permanently store the entire larger chain. Also, just like fast/cheap transactions such as Paypal, Venmo, and Cashapp, Lightning Network is centralized and relies on trust. Except the cool part? It relies and trusts the BLOCKCHAIN, making LN decentralized by proxy. It's centralized to a central ledger, Blockchain, and we all know how that works.
@_date: 2018-05-12 03:20:39
Segwit may not be the only.solution, but it should always be a solution. Because for any given block size and it's downsides, Segwit will increase the capacity without any of the downsides. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 16:00:31
It is a scam if I say "ITS THE REAL ORIGINAL BITCOIN AND THE ORIGINAL CHAIN AND THE CURRENT BITCOIN FORKED FROM IT, AND MINE SCALES BETTER AND IS ACCEPTED EVERYWHERE! BUY BITCOIN (PEN) OR SOME OTHER VERSION THAT SUCKS (BTC, BCH).

@_date: 2018-05-09 20:44:57
Well, as sad as that would be, if that's what had consensus, then that would be the real Bitcoin. I may or may not switch to an altcoin, but Bitcoin would still be Bitcoin.
Also, with the same 10 minute time, both coins SHOULD be equal length. If they are not similar length, then the difficulty is messed up. The longest chain is the main chain, and orphaned chains are purged. It's not about the LONGEST chain, but the chain with the most HASHING power.
@_date: 2018-05-09 18:47:39
It's in the very name! "Bitcoin Cash" was, from the start, made to be Bitcoin. If I made a new coin called "BCash", and said it's Bitcoin Cash, everyone would be saying that the coin is a scam, because from the start, it was made to be misleading.

@_date: 2018-05-23 22:00:29
Well since I had to provide my SSN and ID, Birth Cert, and Passport to open it, they know where to find me.
They used to always approve the transaction, but I put a setting on the account that will only approve transactions that I have in the account, because while I have Overdraft protection, but it only works for 24 hours up to $150, which isn't that useful. Chase Bank used to just approve it then charge me out the ass for going negative.

Also, Lightning Network has 2 second confirmation. 
And what the fuck is BitCash? Bitcoin Cash? The confirmation time on BOTH chains is 10 minutes. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 09:36:10
No, the same way a merchant may not take Bitcoin with 1 confirmation, the peer can decide. 
Technically, 1 confirmation works, or even 0 confirmation, but most peers won't accept payment until it has about 3-4 confirmations for small amounts. The peer can choose to transaction with you or not.

@_date: 2018-05-03 20:05:16
True, but you completely missed my point. Bitcoin Cash doesn't have the second most hashing power, or even the third. "Accumulated hashing power" is useless as a metric, because that includes years of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash might have the 2nd most total POW, but if I fork a coin, it will be tied for  for a bit. You shouldn't count Bitcoin original chain before the fork.
@_date: 2018-05-04 23:45:43
No, BTC is 4MB since Segwit.
@_date: 2018-05-04 21:13:25
No, you couldn't.
Both BCH and BTC have very similar code. Bitcoin Cash got FlexTrans, and Bitcoin got Segwit. Bitcoin Cash changed the difficulty algorithm, and Bitcoin didn't. Bitcoin Cash doesn't work with Bitcoin clients that existed before the fork, and Bitcoin still does.
Since a client from 2 years ago, before BCH existed, still works on Bitcoin, that means Bitcoin is closer to Bitcoin than BCH is.
Accepted everywhere? Well it's a simple fact that Bitcoin is accepted more than ANY altcoin, not just Bitcoin Cash. Of all the places that accept Altcoins though, Bitcoin Cash is the most widely accepted Altcoin.
Bitcoin Cash is just Bitcoin with larger blocksizes. Not "Without a limit". 
Although since Bitcoin Cash specifically was designed and branded to be a ripoff, with the same orange logo and everything, etc. Since it's name, it was misleading, and became a scam when the entire group that forked, launched, and marketed it, all decided to pretend it's something it's not.
If I make a new soda called "Coca Cola Soda" instead of "Coca Cola", but I copied the design, colors, and then marketed it as "Coca Cola, the REAL one!", you bet your ass it would be a scam. Even if the soda tastes the same. The new Soda is not a scam, it's a real drink, with a different name, but if I marketed it as "A cheaper alternative to the official", it's not a scam, but if I market it as "Coca Cola" on purpose, that brand is now a scam.
It's not that you, Bob, or a community made it a scam, it's that the group of developers and literally copied/pasted (And still continues) the code from Bitcoin Core source code (BCH gets updates about a day after, with the same code changes, because Bitcoin ABC literally just copies the code line for line, and you can compare Bitcoin Core to Bitcoin ABC client)
So yeah, no.
@_date: 2018-05-16 23:45:21
Think of it this way:

If you want to get $5,000 cash, you can go to someone who doesn't require any of this information, like on Craigslist. But if you want to get $5,000 cash, you bet your ass the bank is going to get your information.
Coinbase is like a bank. Coinbase needs the information because they ARE BUYING AND SELLING AND TRANSFERRING MONEY FROM BANKS! Legally, Coinbase is required to collect this. EVERY SINGLE EXCHANGE IN THE USA is required to collect your ID or Passport IF they accept USD currency from a bank transfer.

I have a Chase "High School" account from years ago, never updated it because it's free. But I can deposit checks into the ATM whenever I want, and withdraw cash. I can't write any checks FROM the account, because it's not a checking account. It's not a Savings either. 
It's called "Chase High School Bank Account" on my Chase mobile app. 
They gave me a Visa card that is a "Debit" card, except whenever I use it for Uber, it says "Card can't be used because card is a prepaid card, not debit card".
If I spend more than what's on the card, they charge me $34 per day plus 20% of the value I overspent by. So they have this feature that will DECLINE the card instead, if they try to run too much on the account. So I can "Overspend" and can also "Opt out". It may not be "Drafting" but it's kind of the same thing. 
Not really sure what you call it.

The only way for me to overdraft the account is by using an ACH transfer, like from Paypal, Cashapp, or something. I thought that means it's a real bank account.

It greatly increases orphaned chains, and makes it so that each confirmation is 1/10 as secure. Sometimes, you may even get 2-3 confirmation before it being reversed and needing to be re-broadcast. Orphaned chains can cause lots of issues. This means that you need to also wait for more confirmations.
Basically, security is by total work, if the block time was 1 minute, it would be just as secure after 10 confirmations as Bitcoin is currently with 1 confirmation, so there isn't a point.

Well kind of. 
The Segwit blocks are restricted by something called Block Weight. Block Weight is a new concept introduced in Segwit, and it’s calculated on a per-transaction basis. Each transaction has a “weight” which is defined this way:
(tx size with witness data stripped) * 3 + (tx size)
Non-Segwit transactions have zero witness data, so the weight for a non-Segwit transaction is exactly 4 times the size. Segwit transactions have some witness data so the weight is going to be less than 4 times the size. Note Segwit transactions are transmitted to Legacy nodes without witness data, so this formula will always result in blocks communicated to Legacy Nodes that are less than or equal to 1,000,000 bytes.
As soon as Segwit reaches 95% adoption, the block size will be ACTUALLY increased to 4MB, but for now, the max size is limited how many segeit transactions are in the block.

Some places, like Uber, will tell me "Card not accepted", my phone carrier says "We don't accept prepaid cards, only debit and credit cards".

I don't know why that would be, or if it just detects some Chase cards as a "Prepaid" card. Maybe it's a problem with my account then, that it says "Ineligible for checking, or maybe I need to move to a different bank account.

Efficiency doesn't matter because it's always just going match the cost of electricity.

^Bingo. 
I think that we should always increase efficiency first, because for any given chain size and it's advantages or disadvantages, Segwit provides 4x the capacity with no increase in chain size. 
I think someday Bitcoin might need to increase the max block size in a few years, MAYBE, if Lightning becomes popular that everyone wants a channel.

This is what LN is for, it competes with visa with similar electrical costs.
@_date: 2018-06-27 05:05:20
Don't destroy Bitcoin Cash!
We kind of need to have multiple options. The more coins there are, the better it is. This means they compete for leading edge technology. Bitcoin is technically way more advanced, but I think that the stubbornness in increasing the block size more is hurting them. I mean, Sure, LN can compete with Visa, but only if the blocks are big enough to handle the channels. BTC would need 13.88GB blocks to compete with Visa, which obviously won't work. Nobody is going to want to add 83.28GB per hour of HDD space, or use that bandwidth.
Bitcoin Cash's stubbornness in adopting Segwit and LN PURELY for political reasons (They implemented FlexTrans, just as complex, but much less capable, while also not even following the whitepaper). If BTC increases block size through concensus, it will likely win. If BCH gets LN and Segwit (Roger mentioned Segwit before and dropped it, and he talks about getting LN, so fingers crossed) then I think BCH will win.
My own OPINION and EXPERIENCE (As an electrical engineer and dev) tells me Bitcoin is superior, as do most (As evident by the TxOps) then it will win naturally. BTC community is toxic if it's going to destroy Bitcoin Cash purely out of spite.
This is like Walmart, a successful company, driving a tiny mom and pop bike shop out of business because it was way more expensive. Like sure, it's legal, and sure, Walmart would always be ahead, but at least give them a chance and don't be a dick.
@_date: 2018-06-08 15:51:24
But... Why? For any coin, larger blocks means more miners are centralized. 
Currently, to handle all transactions visa does, you'd require 1.3gbps internet to run a full node or to mine to keep up with the network with the large blocks. That just doesn't work. LN works now. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 16:14:11

Imagine 2 separate phones with separate wallets. 
I did a backup of both apps. Then I sent a transaction from Phone 2 to Phone 1, then I restore a backup of Phone 2 so it thinks it never sent the coins, then I close the channel on the  phone with the bad backup. It submits an old transaction. 
Phone 1 automatically popped up that I was waiting 144 blocks for my funds back, because phone 2 tried to scam me and the Olympus server caught it.

The only problem with DAG is that you don't have to compete with anyone. 
For example, it takes me 3 seconds to send you a coin with DAG, but if I wanted to steal it back, I could start brute forcing it. But unlike Bitcoin where you need 51% (because you need to constantly catch up) I could brute Force it, and my time window is as long as you haven't spent it. 
I can take my sweet old time. Sure, after a month I could brute Force a BTC block, but now I have to catch up with the other thousands of blocks. 
That's the main reason I don't like Dag, because the PoW is attatched to each transaction instead of the block, so someone could Target that. Also, that removes any timestamping system, so no hash lock, no security against brute Force target. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 05:36:21

No coin does what LN does. Because LN relies on a traditional blockchain.
No coin can handle an infinate number of transactions. Bitcoin can't, neither can burst. All blockchain are limited by block size, because bandwidth is limited. But having a payment channel means there is no added cost to it. 
No other coin does what LN can. LN transactions can be made peer to peer even when the rest of the blockchain is separate. AKA you can have 3 Bitcoin wallets on 3 different computers, and then disconnect the internet, do some transactions, and then come back online to see the blockchain, and the payment still works. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 15:54:26
This means you'd need a constant 60mbps, which centralizes miners, since that's faster than the internet in most countries. 
Also, no..at the moment you'd need 85gb blocks to keep up with Visa.

Also, we aren't in charge of Cash's value. Government can print more or flood the markets. Bitcoin is held by people with no central control. It's price is defined by every user as a whole. For now, it's volatile but it's volatility will decrease over time.

Renewable energy is not where capitalism is heading, without regulation. Capitalism works really well to bring costs down, until you have something like carbon, in which there is no intrinsic cost-benefit to reducing. Capitalism, but taxing carbon, texting dumping chemicals, and stuff like that, would work really well.
Or, do what we currently do, gives carbon credits each company has a supply of, and they can buy extra or sell excess on a free market, while the total.given slowly are reduced every year. Then there is an incentive to move to clean energy.

Proof of work does not pick the person who completed the most, or else they would get it every time. It works by a lottery system, and the more work you do, the more votes you get.

Well first of all, we are mining 2MB blocks (block weight, 2mb equivelant block size. It's what Segwit was designed for). And the whole point of LN is that it's peer to peer. I can send you money directly to your app through a channel with no middleman. You don't even need to have hubs exist. They can exist, but I don't use it. 
Your app only needs to actually upload and download data when the app is open. 
And that's OK, I use LN Mainnet to buy my dinenr (Alberto's Mexican food) and most of my transactions are off chain anyway, so no fees needed. My highest fee was 4 Satoshi, my lowest fee was -2 Satoshi (if my transaction happens to balance a channel)

Hey, I was willing to take the risk if he sends my ID. I would give him the cash first, literally in person, and then he would give me the Bitcoin.
Or, if he gives me his ID, then I would send him the cash first via direct deposit to his bank account, and then after he sees it in his bank account, then he can send me the coins. Cash deposit like that are not reversible.
Then, if he doesn't send the coins, then I can file a police report because I have his ID.
As far as I'm concerned, she could take my money and run. I'm taking up the risk, not him, but because I have his ID, I'm willing to take that risk in exchange for a 20% discount. He seems like a genuine guy, and I like receiving discounted coins.
I've done this before, where I just deposit cash directly into someone's bank account a local branch, to a teller, and then ask them to send me the coins after. I guess, if we have proof of interaction and I have screenshots of the texts, then I can always go and file a police report if they try to rip me off.
That's being said, I would still recommend that he goes to localbitcoins, because then you only have to wait two days for the money to transfer. If they do an ACH transfer, it's two days, if it's cash, it's a two-day hold, although they usually let you use the first $500 the same day. If he needed absolutely immediately, then I could buy some him for Discount, otherwise, he should use localbitcoins and he could have it in 24 to 48 hours.

Would you consider BitTorrent peer-to-peer?
And no, but the point is that even if it costs around $10 for a channel, you'd only need to open the channel once. A single time. 
And leaving that channel open indefinitely, you can preform all transactions for no fees. With LN, you're competing on price. Since processing a transaction cost next to no time or energy or money, it is practical to charge 0.00001c worth of BTC at the moment to route a transaction.

You don't know how LN works...
You don't need a payment channel with the pizza guy. 
I use LN mainnet to buy Mexican food at Alberto's a few times a week. I have ONE LN channel open to TorGuard. That's it. No channel to Albertos, and I don't need it :D 
If you needed to open a payment channel with everyone, Ln Would be so useless nobody would ever use it. Luckily, this is not how it works ;)
I can pay ANYONE on the Lightning Network without opening a channel, if I have one open already to anyone else. I can open a channel while paying too if I needed to. 
LN channels only need one confirmation to open or close.
I didn't downvote anyone here, but I will downvote this one because you are spreading complete bullshit about LN. 
Why would you have to open a LN channel with the pizza guy? Do you need a direct wire to Google's servers? No! You have a line to your router, which has a line to your noxem, which has a line to the node, which has a line to the ISP local switch, etc. 
If you have ANY LN channel open with ANYONE, you can pay anyone on the Ln Network. 
When I found out Alberto's accepts LN, I scanned a barcode and paid for it and it was done after only 3 seconds of loading. Fully confirmed, and also I still don't have a channel with them.
I use Eclaire for Android, I built the source code and changed the single constant to mainnet.

In this case, it's considered Secue when there are no un-stated loopholes. The only way to attack the network are the ways the whitepaper have already stated, and clearly define the probability of. It's "Secure" because there is no way to get around it.
You can open a LN channel with both parties having zero BTC.  You can top up a channel with either a single blockchain transaction, you can open a channel AT THE SAME TIME as paying someone on chain, so that it doesn't cost any more, OR you can move from one LN channel to another off of the blockchain.

So proof of space is exactly what it sounds like. They have computations that are extremely difficult, but you only have to do once. For example, the hash that instead of producing 256 bits, it is 1mb each, which can take 5 minutes on a graphics card. The network generates a "ticket" of a random series of numbers to solve, and the length determine difficulty. Each person saved the seed used to generate the 1mb block, so they scan the hard drive for that sequence. If it gets a hit, it submits the seed used for the block and the position they found it in. That way it uses next to no electricity to scan a SSD. It also reduces centralization of miners, because it doesn't cost anything. Sure, some will buy huge mining drives, but people who just have leftover space on the computer will let it be used to mine with, and then will automatically delete when you use more space.
Basically, the solutions are way too hard to solve real time, so you just prove you solved it in the past and prove you have the hard drive space. The point of mining is to prove resources that are finate, and space is finate and proving you did the work and maintained the space.

This is true, but keep in mind, that if the node goes offline, all of the peers have to be sure it will not come back online. If they don't announce that they don't have a backup, people will close their channels, because they are not going to risk trying to steal funds and potentially lose them.

No, that's like a mempool.
An open tab means you haven't paid yet, a Ln Channel let's you pay and settle instantly.
It's like giving him your credit card and he puts a pre-charge which he can increase later, or decrease, then fully charge when you close the channel (if it was impossible to reverse)
It's more like putting it in a safe he controlls that has an auto open timer but you have password to, so if he agrees to show you and you agree to open it, you can change the amount.
Then later when you "close the channel" you're giving him the password to take the balance you owe. (Just imagine it's an indestructable safe)

Very good questions, but they are based off a misunderstanding of the network’s protocol and functionality. Why would there be an issue "Locking" in more than one channel? Is there an issue "Locking" funds into a standard bitcoin wallet? Of course not! What if you “Lock” funds into a Segwit wallet? Of course not! If you have funds in a LN channel, or in cold hard storage, and want to spend it to a legacy address, both of them are the same, in that I can spend it with a single on-chain transaction.
LN works similarly to BTC. You can move money from one channel to another off the blockchain, between your channels, in a triangle. Your wallet app actually manages all the channels, so you just scan and go, it takes care of it. If you want to send to a legacy BTC address off the LN channel, you can do a SINGLE "Top up" to take funds out of the LN channel and broadcast right to the other person, or a single transaction back to the channel.
It isn't any different than having a dedicated wallet just to buy things, and leaving all funds in it. If you can't afford $1 to leave in each channel, just stick to Fiat. Just keep $1 minimum in each channel, which is about the most you’d be required to lock up. Also, even if all your transactions go through a single source, the peer DOESN’T KNOW that you are the only source. It’s source routed. They don’t know if you sent/received, if you’re a hub, or if you happen to be routing other transactions. 
My cell phone can run a hub with about 3,500 connections. Not terribly expensive, a laptop would do, or a VPS for $4 a month. As for hubs? Because you can send money between each channel off chain, you’d be fine. Both parties can agree on a minimum balance, and if the hub has a policy that they always leave their side empty, then that’s just something that the users could/would agree to. I mean, I may not want to open a channel with less than 10 satoshi, but I would be fine with it.
If I have 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 channels open, I could run a hub with $1000 worth of bitcoin. That just means I can only route a MAXIMUM of $1000 at a time. That’s it. I can have a hub “I only will process transactions up to $1,000”. I’d do this by routing a transaction, then moving those funds from that channel to another to route again, then moving it and doing it again, over and over. Since it is off the chain, there is no issues. Of course, this is slow, and I would only be able to handle about 250 transactions per second, but if I double the funds I have, or reduce my max transaction size in half, I could increase this. In reality, I can charge higher fees for larger transactions (3 satoshi for anything over $1,000 worth) and then move all funds to one channel to process it.
Actually, because LN has Atomic multipathing, it would be possible for a hub to process a 10BTC transaction with only 1BTC, it would take 10 times as long. Or 100BTC with only 1 satoshi, which could take an hour or two (unrealistic, but my point is it’s possible)&gt;
Running a LN node doesn’t really cost much. Next to no CPU power or electricity, no expensive hardware (A smartphone can do it) and doesn’t require a high capital. In practice, a hub with 200 channels would want at least $30 in it, to process transactions up to about 300 per second without bottlenecks or backlogs. 
The way LN works, you CAN’T route unencrypted transactions. They would break the protocol and be invalid. It’s routed by wrapping the transaction in encryption from the destinations private key, and wrapping that with the destination public key into another layer with the one before that, and works backwards. It’s called Onion Routing. It means that transactions are ALWAYS encrypted, and any hub is unable to tell if you are sending, if you are routing, or even how many hops it took before and after. Hell, it doesn’t even know if it’s sending to the destination, or just routing back to your other channel to balance it! 
If they decide to not route your transactions, or decide that they won’t without requesting information, you can submit a closing transaction on them, or just refuse to use them. Unlike ISP, the network doesn’t depend on geographic location.

I think that having a decentralized voting system is great.
People "vote" for what changes they want by either adding them or not. If every single available wallet adds a feature, then people all use it, it's wanted..if it's unwanted, then don't use that software. It's that simple. Someday, when quantum computers become a thing, and it will be possible to find every single possible input to generate a giving hash instantly, Bitcoin will fail. But wait! Before we get to that point, if/when everyone agrees to change the POW to maybe Proof of space or even another POW other than SHA256, it will be fine! This would be a Hard fork, which would be the FIRST time Bitcoin split making a new coin (like how Bitcoin cash split then split again, now there is Bitcoin cash and Bitcoin Clashic) this would generate a new coin, probably Bitcoin New and the old useless one would be called "Bitcoin/Bitcoin legacy" (since it's the original, the one we have now). It will never be the original Bitcoin at that point, but if we have concensus, it wouldn't fuck the markets up. 
It's important Bitcoin DOES change with technology and times. That's the beauty in a decentralized, open source currency that relies on concensus. It's basically an accidental voting system. 
Is the majority of the network all agrees that they want a specific feature, then it can be added. It doesn't have to be centralized.
Just like html is open and free and anyone can use it, if people make an update, like HTML5, and people choose to use it or not, it doesn't mean it's centralized. It just means that it's progress, and if it sucks, nobody would use it and it would die.
Segwit is backwards compatible, if you choose not to use it, you can still use Bitcoin exactly as it was before. There is no reason not to use it, unless you don't have the hard drive space to update to it. And again, it's an open protocol that is clearly defined, and it wasn't just one team that updated all software. It was multiple groups and multiple developers all implementing this protocol into their wallet at the same time. And they were hoping people would use it, but people are not required to.

I know, but I mean that YOU get to choose the entire routing. Any intermediately nodes DO NOT get to choose where to route it.
YOU send the bitcoin, YOUR client chooses the routing with its own algorithm and logic, and YOU get to choose this. If the client chooses to route to the peer through other nodes, then it WILL follow that path. 
The routing algorithm can be different depending on the client you use. By "Client" I am talking about the sending party, which is using it's own Onion mesh routing algorithm. The "Nodes" are still running on the "Client" software of their choice, but I will refer to them as "Nodes".
You can also have a crappy routing algorithm that uses a bunch of hops, also.
@_date: 2018-03-03 22:38:01
Yes. The mining algorithm encourages it. Everyone stops for just one block then when it adjusts they mine the shit out of it.

@_date: 2018-03-02 03:40:08
Oh, that's not Bitcoin. BCH miners require a lot of resources since it takes 8 times the CPU, internet, and hard drive space. 
BCH miners manipulate the markets a lot by not mining, waiting for the difficulty to adjust and imemdiately mine the crap out of it at low difficulty.
Bitcoin has orders of magnitude more hashing power, so if they do this, it's just a 1% difference and they would miss out on rewards too.
BCH does this a lot, but it's not possible or profitable on BTC.

Yeah... Doubt it. I mean, you're free to decompile it yourself, but the code gets pretty messy. I personally gave up trying to read it, but I'm sure some people have decompiled it. 
Now, this might be different if this was another company, but the fact that Coinomi has a public headquarters you can visit, is registered as a bank in London, and has a support team that you can call, and who speaks English and is located at the headquarters, kind of makes me trust them.

Also, while it's not "Open source" since you can't copy/use the code yourself legally, all code can be reviewed. It's to prevent people from creating a malicious edited version.
The code is all still "Open" in that you can read the entire code (And build it yourself, if you want to risk a lawsuit)
George Kimionis the Founder and CEO of Coinomi stated:


In short, the code is open for review, but not technically "Open source" because you can't copy/use it without legal implications. (Nothing is physically stopping you, though.)
The only difference between this and open source is that open source lets you do whatever you want, and their license says "Look at the code all you want, but you have NO permission to fork it, create a new wallet using this code, modifying it, or passing it as your own.

It does,.by chance. If you submit a transaction that happens to be 8 seconds before the block is mined you'd be lucky. Once I submitted a transaction and had 2 confirmations in 2 minutes. Other times I have none in 35 minutes. IT DOES happen soemtimes, randomly. 
If BTC handles 7 transactions per second, then 7 people that submitted before the block was mined get it confirmed in the second. SOMEONE does, but it's rare. 
I know, it takes time for a transaction to be added, but still. 
Use LN, fully confirmed in 1.5 seconds.

this is also a reply to you. 
Titanic was called "unsinkable" because the engineers calculated that with the bulkheads in place, a few could fill up. They already knew that if more than that took on water, it would sink. They calculated the risk as being infantesmally small because you'd need to take hull damage across multiple bulkhead sections. 
The engineers knew it wasn't unsinkable. Even after it was hit, before most people knew what was happening, the engineers knew it would sink. Some people advertise laptops like the Panasonic Tough book as "indestructable" even though nobody truly knows it's impossible to destruct. 
The difference is that one is based off of pure logic, algorithms, and math, and the other is not. Had the Titanic hull been made of literally 8 foot thick Titanium Iridium alloy fully enclosed and sealed off with a lattice of sealed metal sponge-like structure inside, it would be impossible to sink without thermite or a drill, or without exceeding the documented limitations of the material. 
Having a clear design limitation that defines it's protocol, will tell you if it's able to be breached or not. 
In the case of Segwit, the protocol has clearly defined definitions, attack vector and probability functions, etc. 
And bitcoins security comes from profitability, and that's clearly defined. Technically, the top 22 richest people in the world have the money to buy computers and electricity to make changes to the Bitcoin network. But the amount of money they could possibly gain is less than 3% of the money they'd spend doing it, and they would do much better to just mine and play by the rules. But I still consider this secure, because the limitations are clearly stated, and the protocol has clearly stated attack vectors.
Software, potentially.
Protocol, no. Lightning Network protocol is 100% secure, because it is secured by math. I'm not saying that someone can't write software that is buggy, or write software that is exploitable. I am saying that the Lightning Network is 100% secure, because the protocol is. There have been bugs in Bitcoin software, but because of the way Bitcoin protocol works, I can't just submit a transaction that steals money from someone else without their private key. 
Could someone write software that works with Segwit protocol that can potentially lose funds? Sure they can! Can someone double spend a Segwit transaction? Nope. Because it would be considered invalid by the protocol if it was able to be double spent, and therefore as long as Segwit protocols are implamented, Segwit is 100% secure. Period. 
I am sure that the AES256 encryption algorithm is 100% secure, in that it's design makes it impractable to crack. However, I wouldn't say my aes256 encrypted hard drive is secure, because it's using a password that is only 9 charachters as the seed, using my own password. I also have it written down. 
That being said, if I create a file encrypted with a randomly generated key, then I destroy the key, I am 100% sure it will never be cracked. 
Yes, people lose money on mainnet. This is not a flaw with Lightning Network protocol though. Just because a calculator says 2+2=5 doesn't mean math is insecure, it means the calculator is. 
When people lose funds (2 of the 3 common wallets have lost funds before, and the only one that hasn't is still buggy in other ways) it's not due to LN protocol being insecure, it's due to the software that is being developed to make use of the LN protocol as defined in the BOLT documentation. 
There was a bug in an older Bitcoin wallet that caused it to accidentally send Bitcoin to a different address, effectively losing coins. The Bitcoin network behaved as it was supposed to, but the software was bugged. This doesn't mean Bitcoin is not secure, it means that the software was. 
It's like having an impenetrable door with a flimsy window next to it. Sure, the door can be proven secure, but it doesn't mean there is a way into the house. 
Lightning Network, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, etc all can be proven secure by mathmaticsl algorithms. Just because the wallet has bugs doesn't mean the LN protocol does. 
"Bitcoin isn't secure because someone stole my phone, then wiped it and now I lost those coins!
No, Bitcoin is secure. You lost your phone. The phone and Bitcoin app behaved exactly as it's supposed to. 
"LN isn't secure because my app didn't send money to the right place, my wallet didn't correctly parse the channel close request, and didn't register that I received any money!" That's a problem with the app, the implamentation, not the LN protocol. 
Just like Bitcoin users lose funds a lot, sending money to the wrong place, or their app crashing and resetting deleting their wallet. That all sucks, but it doesn't mean Bitcoin is insecure and will always lose your funds. If you have a perfectly written bug free app, there would be ZERO way for someone else to steal or lose your funds, because the PROTOCOL is secure. If you had a perfect implamentation of LN, it wouldn't lose funds because the PROTOCOL is secure, therefore leaving no undocumented attack vector. The only LN attack vector is to DDOS the peer continuously for the entire N-Lock time. Then you'd have to be 100% sure that they don't come online, because the second they do, they get their money back AND yours. So you need to be 100% sure you can DDOS them without them connecting to the internet at all. That is the only attack vector, and because it's layer routed (Onion routing) by the source, there is no attack vector for any intermediate hops. 
Does this make sense? If it doesn't, let me know and I will attempt to explain it another way. 
LN is secure. BTC is secure. Segwit is secure. Some LN, BTC, and Segwit-enabled apps may have bugs that can cause loss of funds (or theft if you literally have an unencrypted wallet sitting on your desktop with remote desktop enabled and no password, etc).

No it's alright! 
It's something that's new to bitcoin, and it's not part of that coin, it's just something that a lot of clients have agreed to use.
It's not part of Bitcoin protocol, it is just a method that many decentralized protocols CAN use for discovery. 
One method is to just have a list of 100 "always online" nodes and each of them have it's own peers, so if any are online, you just ask it for it's peers and recursive. 
A distributed hash table works if you don't have a list. You scan every ip address at random until one has the client running and responds with a public DHT of all known nodes, and then you can find every single peer like that, by adding your own and then redistributing it. When you go offline, people see that and then remove you after a while. When you come back online, you can either use your hash table that you saved and scan to see who is still online and start again, or you can just scan IP addresses until you find one to download.
It's a brilliant system that helps decentralized protocols find each other on the internet, and find all piers. I believe it started out with BitTorrent P2P File Sharing protocol.

Because the peer can look at how many coins you have, most wallets at the moment will not allow any transactions to take place which leaves the peer with less than a minimum number of coins. Right now, the limit is around $1.

What if someone started printing dollar bills that are made from the same paper but says "International bux" instead. Nobody would accept it because nobody could spend it, and nobody would use it. Bitcoin is also backed by TRUST, (kind of, hear me out) like any other currency. 
The reason why someone is willing to trade a digital string of numbers for a car is becuase they know they can turn around and get something of roughly equal value to the car with it. People trust that others will accept it. And if one person doesn't accept it, another will eventually. Until so few people do, you stop using it, so they stop accepting it once enough stop using it. 
Bitcoins value to you IS NOT what you believe it is. Even if you think "who the hell would accept Bitcoin, it has no value to me" you would probably buy 1 Bitcoin for $100 or even $1000 dollars, because even though YOU don't believe in it, you TRUST that others would be willing to pay even more for it.

Someone can make another clone of Bitcoin, which is what "Testnet Bitcoin" is. It's literally an exact clone of Bitcoin (but since it's a different network, it's not compatible).
Basically, you can use a real-live Bitcoin test network by changing one single number in your code. It's used to test your code on Bitcoin without the chance of losing money. They are worthless, and now and then the network is reset. You can even go get hundreds of Testnet coins for free. they always ask you to send them back when you're done testing, because at the end of the day, it is still a Bitcoin clone and works exactly the same way. And some people just hold them until there aren't enough to go round and then the network is reset and start over again. cuz it's simply worthless. It's kind of like using a copy of a dollar bill except with "Avery's ATM CO TEST BILL" printed on it, used for testing ATM's. 
but nobody is going to use a copy of Bitcoin when they can just use Bitcoin everywhere, because the copy would not be able to be accepted everywhere. even though it seems like you should be able to make a copy and then just use it at the same place as Bitcoin, that is not how it works. It is still a different network and would be incompatible. If you did use this copy code, you could in theory if you sort a copy of The ledger and got up to date, but by that time, it means you would have had to have obtained the coins in the tossed already. Or start at working on anyway, which means again, you're just using Bitcoin.
Basically,the answer to any question that you can have related to this is going to be the same as if you were asking about making "AveryBux" with a security strip, special ink, etc just like US currency. Technically comparable, but since it's not US dollars and isn't accepted, there is absolutely no incentive to even try to obtain it.
Except Dogecoin. Some people made millions because people started trading them like beanie babies (it's a joke meme) and maybe Etherium Cryptokitties.

Bitcoin is Not centralized. Neither is LN. The only part of LN (like I have said) that is centralized is that it's centralized to the blockchain for disputes, which means it's decentralized by proxy.
Because Bitcoin is a peer to peer/decentralized system, despite the fact that your transactions must be sent to nodes. The whole point is that it is a trustless peer-to-peer system. It doesn't have to be direct, and BitTorrent for example isn't either. Yes, sometimes your BTC transaction gets routed from one node and propegates to the rest. But it doesn't affect it's trustless nature. 
Lightning network is quite brilliant, really. Basically, LN doesn't really have an inharent security, but piggybacks off the blockchain for disputes only, with a fine/court system (controlled by the blockchain). Brilliant.

So Bitcoin Core is just able to control everything about the protocol without users decision? Yeah... No... 
This is like saying Linux is arrogant because Linux foundation develops for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Core is just the name of the group of developers, everyone from me to Fred, to even you (not sure if you're a dev or not, but I assume not because you think Bitcoin Core is a "company" that "writes Bitcoin". 
Satoshi published "Bitcoin" which is the reference implamentation of Bitcoin, but it was changed to "Bitcoin Core" to differentiate the reference software from the network. For this reason, it is also known as the Satoshi client. It is the reference implementation for bitcoin nodes. They don't get to change or define the protocol. They are simply the reference implamentation. 
Bitcoin Cash has a wallet too, and it's considered the "official" wallet, except that it is only a reference. Just because the wallet is known as the "reference" doesn't mean Bitcoin cash is arrogant either. Bitcoin cash is developed by it's users, like you and me, just like Bitcoin is (I assume, just fewer devs because if fewer users).
Anyone can implament the Bitcoin protocol hwoevee they want, securely or not. That's up to you, you could implament it yourself. Bitcoin Core is just the reference IMPLAMENTATION of the protocol, setting the standard and source code to show people how it is done, so they can build changes to it. 
Because there is no formal structure, development is based around Bitcoin Improvement Proposals or BIPs, which are similar to Request for Comments. Public mailing lists are used to vet initial expressions of ideas. If enough support is displayed a BIP document is written. This is the standard for sharing ideas and gaining community feedback on improving bitcoin. 
Bitcoin Core does not decide which features to add, or set the standards. They didn't even invent or set the Segwit standard. They got a shit ton of requests to implament the protocol and they did. They just happened to put together code, tweaked by thousands of devs over the world, until it was perfect, then released it as a "reference" with the source code. 
It's done much the same way as Linux. Nobody owns Linux, nobody can shut it down. It's open source, developed by tons of people. 
You should maybe... I don't know... Learn about what you're trying to pretend to know.

No, you can use whatever you want. They usually just use Coinbase on a cellphone and you scan the QR code. Topup works with T-Mobile. I don't know what Alberto's uses, but they just have a laminated card stock with a QR code, and I use Eclair Lightning wallet for mainnet (built the source code to work on mainnet).
You scan it, and send the right amount. 
Maybe someday they should have it pop up a QR to scan with the actual amount requested on a screen, but we will see.

Yes, on that implementation, it is helping to continuously update other nodes of which nodes it is connected to. It is also broadcasting information about itself to the network so that each knows receives information about every nodes that is online.
You don't have to broadcast though, the network is still fine without it. Kind of like how mining is essential for bitcoin, but mining isn't a requirement to run a node or to use it.

No, you ask me to close the channel, and if I don't within a single block confirmation, you can broadcast a close transaction to the blockchain. After that time out, it automatically is released into your wallet, you don't need to submit another one. 
Of course, by you, I mean your wallet. You never have to do anything. Your wallet opens, closes, manages, and routes everything for you. 
As far as you're concerned, you're using a regular Bitcoin wallet, and see that fees are between 4 Satoshi and -2 Satoshi.

The value is more than just material costs.
Sure I can cook a good meal in 3 hours, but I hate it. And I'd pay $30 for 3 hours of my life back.
Just cause you have $5000 in machinery and tools doesn't mean everyone does. Do you expect your average Joe to design and then send in the design to be made? Or even design and spend less than 4 hours on it, chatting with the shop, etc? To some people, 4 hours of aggrevation is worth the $30. 
The average Joe doesn't have the machinery, water jet, cnc, or hell, even a fucking laser cutter over 50 watts to cut through that metal. 
Material cost doesn't make the value. Your phone in your hand is made of atoms and materials around $13, what makes it expensive is the fact that you alone are not capable of rearranging those molecules into a phone. Same with his, sure you can buy a hunk of metal, but the time, knowledge, and skill required to create it exceeds the average Joe's ability. This is why it's $35, because it cost $15-20 to make and they need to make a profit. And pay off the machinery and costs of starting a business.

It's very very common for any peer-to-peer discovery. The old method was just have a list of nodes that are online and connect to their IP address. It's just a way to do this without a centralized server. The entire implamentation is about 15kb and it's something BitTorrent has had for years. 
A DHT is simply a key-value store distributed accross a number of nodes in a network. The keys are distributed among nodes with a deterministic algorithm. Each node is responsible for a portion of the hash table.
A routing algorithm allows to perform requests in the hash table without knowing every node of the network.
For exemple in the Chord DHT —which is relatively simple DHT implementation— each node is assigned an identifier and is responsible of keys which are closer to its identifier.
Imagine there is 4 nodes that have identifiers: 2a6c, 7811, a20f, e9c3 The data with the identifier 2c92 will be stored on the node 2a6c.
Imagine now that you only know the node 7811 and you are looking for the data with the identifier eabc.
You ask the node 7811 for the data eabc. 7811 doesn't have it so it ask the node e9c3 wich send it to node 7811 which send it back to you.
A clever algorithm allows to find data in O(log(N)) jumps. Without storing the entire routing table of the network (the addresses of each nodes). Basically you ask the closest node to the data identifier you know wich itself asks the closest node it knows and so on reducing the size of the jump at each step.
A DHT is very scalable because the data are uniformly distributed among nodes and lookup time generally grows in O(log(N)).

The community wasn't split over Segwit. It's like if we decided self driving cars was the future, but you could still buy manual cars. If someone wanted a mnaual car, they could buy one, so what is the issue?
If you want the original Bitcoin that Satoshi released himself, download Satoshis client and it will work on Bitcoin. Don't use Segwit if you don't want to. I get it, Segwit, while being technically better, is still not "nostalgic". So fair enough.

Good thing they aren't using Tor then!
Onion Routing is just what TOR happens to use. Basically, I decide the path I want to take. I use the public key to encrypt the second node, then I use the second node's key to encrypt the third node, etc.
I send it off. ONLY the first node can decrypt it, yielding an encrypted packet with an unencrypted instruction on what node is next, then they forward it to the next node. They then decrypt it, and keep sending it off, until the final node gets it and gets the entire payment. The second to final node doesn't know how many hops it took before or after. For all they know, you sent directly to them!

But this is okay, because it is not an insecurity, because this is a clearly defined protocol limitation. 
I may say "This door is secure against any house robber you will ever come across" and then yo drop a 400 megaton nuke on it, you just "hacked" the door, but it was still secure against the attack vector stated. I can garentee that your peer can't withdrawal funds from the channel without your private key. Period.

We were split over the upcoming Segwit2X coin, which was supposed to be like Bitcoin Cash but had so many changes it was no longer Bitcoin. Then we started an entirely new approach (also called Segwit, but didn't modify or change the Bitcoin network therefore satoshis own software himself would still work with Bitcoin even with Segwit)
This was NOT controversial, because there were zero downsides. It didn't change Bitcoin compatibility and old nodes or anyone who didn't want to use Segwit would be free to not use it, and just use Satoshis original Bitcoin (and still work with people who elected to use Segwit)
It's like saying "Driving a car is fun and I always want the option to drive myself"
"Well here is anself driving Tesla!"
"NOOOO SELF DRIVING CARS MEAN I CANT DRIVE!"
HINT: You can still drive it manually if you want. 
Do you think that electric cars are ruining cars? I don't, because you can still get a gas car. Let people do what they want.

Binance is exempt from being shut down by the USA govornment, because IT'S NOT A USA EXCHANGE AND USA HAS NO CONTROL!
So I guess USA could shut down Chinese websites too remotely? As if they have legal power over the entire world?
You can purchase tether via Wire, Cash (Locally at Tether ATM's or craigslist).
I got bitcoin by being paid for work, I got bitcoin by paying cash, and I got bitcoin by selling some stuff.
If I wanted to cash out without using a US Bank (Coinbase) I would need to sell it via cash locally which will expect a great discount. Ultimately, it's a pain in the ass if I want to day trade on any exchange that won't exchange to US currency. Tether is useful to sell high and buy low without waiting 5 days in between. Plus, wire transfers suck. Look on Reddit. Sometimes they steal money, lose it, or refuse to credit you. 
Lastly, I don't doubt it. TETHER SUCKS! We both agree on this. But TETHER ONLY SUCKS BECAUSE IT'S NOT BACKED!
You can purchase tether directly from the website, or cash out at any time, if you want to do a safe Bank transfer (Not wire) to Binance or Bitfinex who won't do it otherwise. If Tether was actually backed fully, it's a brilliant solution. It just sucks that Tether had to be a snake. If they honestly have $1 backed for each Tether, then it will be stable and it will not crash.
That's all I am saying. The reason it is so big is because $30 wire transfer every time you want to exchange between Fiat and Crypto is the only way to do it in most of the worlds countries in most currencies.
If you happen to live in the USA or Canada AND have a valid ID or passport, and SSN, you're spoiled, you don't need Tether, therefore I don't expect you to understand how much of a lifesaver it is. Imagine if GDAX didn't let you trade between Bitcoin and USD, and you could sell or buy with USD at $30 per transaction. You wouldn't be able to day trade that way! On many exchanges, this is how it is. GDAX happens to be a US Bank (Legally) and so they will 1099 you (Submit tax papers to the government so if you don't pay you're going to be fined) and they follow all Anti-Money-Laundering laws. If you are audited, legally, the IRS can freeze your Crypto assets and contact Coinbase for financial transactions.
Bitfinex or Binance, they can't do this because the USA can not shut down a website or exchange that's international.

Does Nordstrom have control over and pay interest on the Wallet you bought from Nordstrom store? Of course not! 
What kind of actual physical wallet do you use to store debit cards and cash? That brand? Do they store your money for you? Can they loan it out? Duh, of course not!
Same thing. This is how Bitcoin works. It's not saved by the company. They can't even see that you have Bitcoin. The "wallet" is just an app that types in all the complicated code for you, so that you don't have to type in tons of codes and encryption keys and stuff just to send or receive it. The wallet just makes it easy for you to do it and does it in the background. 
Does Bitpay have access to your bitcoins stored on your Bitpay wallet on your phone? No! Not at all!
You are using a wallet coded by them, but THEY DO NOT have your bitcoins. There is no login for the wallet. 
If you want someone to pay you interest, just may as well do it with USD for now. 
If you have bitcoins on your laptop and your laptop is destroyed, without your backup or a copy of your private key that is used to interact with the network, youll never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever see those bitcoins again, period, and nobody else will, period. Not Bitpay, not zap, nobody. If you contact Bitpay wallet company, they will tell you "Sorry, we don't even know how many people use our wallet, because we don't even have servers to create accounts, anyone can download it and use it and we have no connection and can't see how much money is in it"
If Bitpay company shut down forever and died, Bitpay wallet would work and your bitcoins would be yours. You never give up control of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is called "digital cash" because it's the FIRST currency EVER to both behave and be cash, while ALSO being digital with no middleman. PayPal holds your money. Chase holds your money. Venmo holds your money. 
Bitcoin does not. It's cash. The analogy would be physically buying a wallet by Calvin Klein and putting $100 in it. You didn't give $100 for Calvin Klein to control, because you physically hold on to it. 
You just chose a Calvin Klein wallet to hold your dollars in.

So far, 100% of blocks indicate that miners are in support, and there's no indication that mining pools will let up - should they fail to do so, their blocks would be orphaned, meaning they wouldn't be able to collect bitcoin's valuable block rewards.
That being said, a miner is free to run a node that still does not implement segwit, but because they would only be able to add transactions that are legacy to legacy only, they will see diminishing fees. This will make it more profitable to move to Segwit because eventually, the majority of transactions will be sent either to or from a Segwit address.
This might be bad for miners short term, because lower fees mean lower payout, but at the same time, lower fees are better for everyone, and as the reward drops, some miners exit, which then increases payout for the rest. Also, lower fees mean more transactions which end up being about the same long term, balancing out.
If you are a miner, you are not forced to switch, but you will see diminishing fees over time, as a block mined with a legacy miner which includes Segwit transactions would be considered invalid and would be orphaned. The miner would need some Segwit Code to check which are segwit and which are not, which means that they can choose to only include non-segwit blocks. For whatever reason... Nostalgia or just living in the past, I guess. Since security isn't an issue.
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:11:15
Bitcoin cash doesn't follow the whitepaper since they separated the miners from the rest of the nodes. 
Since Bitcoin follows the whitepaper the same as Bitcoin Cash does, it's not needed.

@_date: 2018-02-16 22:13:27
It's not that Segwit will make YOU pay higher fees, it just means because Segwit fees are lower, you would just not get much of a fee discount. You'd still get lower fees than if Segwit didn't exist because others still clear the mempool.

Yes, but you'd have to outpace the rest of the network. 
In order to screw with the network, I need to have 51% of the hashing power (well, long term).
This means I need to buy enough to have control.
I mean this is exactly what keeps it secure, is millions of people running these hashing algorithms. If you wanted to waste hashing power, even if your tiny computer gets lucky on a block, the chance of it happening again is infantesmally small. Sure, you can win the mega lottery 6 times in a row, but the chances are so slim it's not worth buying 1 million dollars in tickets each time.

I think BTC does need to increase the block size again. BTC already increased the max block size to 4mb with Segwit, and we've already seen blocks over 2mb. I think it will need to be doubled if we want to see it become a global currency. With Lightning Network, it's essentially using the blockchain as a court system. The only transactions would need to be new users, and that's it. Because you can move funds from one channel to another for free, and if you always accept payment with LN, you'd never need to do a blockchain transaction.
Also, opening a channel can be done while paying someone, so you can pay one fee to both make a first payment and open a channel at the same.time.

I have a $4,500 CNC machine, and it would take me about 3 hours and $25 in material costs to just make one, and that's assuming I know what I am doing and have the time and money.
If I charge my standard rate of $100 per hour, plus $20 for the metal, plus make a profit, I would charge $420 to make this one time.
That's fairly standard. I honestly didn't look at the price yet, but a fair price is going to be around $50 in the quantities they are likely selling, to offset the tooling cost and make a profit. $25 if I want to break-even without my time, or $40 to break even paying someone $15 per hour (Minimum wage in my Californian city).
They could probably make it feasible to sell for $40 with a decent profit though :)
If it was a 3D printer, this would be more like $10, with a $1 material cost heh, but it would melt. But it's not.
I want to see YOU make one! :P
Edit: They sell for $35 which is pretty much right in line with making $5-10 per unit :)

The only reason why I'm willing to trade my car for a stack of paper is because I know that I can take that paper to someone else and trade the paper for something of similar value to the car that I traded for the paper in the first place.
Bitcoin is not quite there yet, but I do know that I can use Bitcoin to pay people.
As far as I know, only five or six restaurants around me take Bitcoin, and only one takes Bitcoin lightning (Alberto's Mexican food) but as it's more widely adopted, the value will stabilize. Realistically, I doubt it will ever get above $50,000. But eventually, with adoption, the price will stabilize.

In theory, the whole network knows the channel state, so a method to verify the channel state (you won't be able to restore a backup from this without all the private keys from your peer, and therefore can't submit a penalty transaction, but your peer? They don't know that! Well, at minimum the client can and should be able to know if a channel state is valid or invalid, to know if it's safe to close the channel or not. Best bet is to just wait and wait until the peer force close it.

You don't sound like a programmer.
Basically, you have to give up your private key for that wallet state in order to sign the next transaction. That means that if you want to write to the blockchain that you have a different amount, the other person already has two private keys to the wallet that it would be using, so they get to take all of the money in it.

It's a recent feature that came along with segwit.
With a stealth address, you ask payers to generate a unique address in such a way that you (using some additional data which is attached to the transaction) can deduce the corresponding private key. So although you publish a single "stealth address" on your website, the block chain sees all your incoming payments as going to separate addresses and has no way to correlate them. (Of course, any individual payer knows their payment went to you, and can trace how you spend it, but they don't learn anything about other people's payments to you.)
This means that if three people send money to the same address, each one of them can only see their transactions.
@_date: 2018-02-17 00:13:19
One more note, even non-segwit wallets already do this. When you open your Bitpay app, you can use it without downloaidng 150gb of the blockchain. Same with most wallets, Jaz, Ledger, none of them download the entire chain... This is similar.

You can trade on gdax because they require you to give an ID card, and because they do ACH bank transfers. If you are not a US citizen, or you did not want to give your ID card, then that's it. Also, because gdax is legally a bank, they can seize your funds at any time, if the government wants to. If you are doing a wire transfer, they charge you $20 for International Plus the receiver charges $10. I don't want to pay $30 just to wire money over. If you are in the United States and Canada, you are lucky enough to be able to use gdax or coinbase if you give them your social security number. That's probably better for most people, provided that they are US citizens, but keep in mind is that the world has 7 billion people, most of which are not living in the United States. Most exchanges are not legally registered as Banks. Therefore, most exchanges do not even accept Bank transfers, and some of them accept wire transfers, but there is a $30 charge.

Maybe the price will, but probably not.
If I start printing "AveryBux" on my own printer at home, they are going to be worthless. People might pay a penny for one just as a joke but nobody is going to give it value because they can't use it anywhere, and they can't use it anywhere because nobody accepts it, and nobody accepts it because nobody uses it because it has no value.
Quinn actually had value is because there was no alternative. Now, there is no reason for anybody to even touch a clone of Bitcoin when they can just use an existing cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, that is already widely accepted and works everywhere. By making a new coin, it would be as if I made "AveryBux". Same paper, same ink, different pattern, not accepted anywhere. They can just use US dollars, a currency they know will be accepted elsewhere.

Okay, great. So the library simplifies writing code. The functions are definitely not simple though. So... what are you trying to show me? Salt, a cryptographic library?
I used to develop for the MSP430, for electic car ECU and Battery Management Systems. It doesn't really mean anything. It took me 2 years to learn how to develop for crypto. It's tough. But sometimes, having complex code is a good thing. Tiny block sizes and large block sizes lead to centralization. You need to also trade off the block time, as well. Being able to get the best of both world is a good thing. Just because you don't understand it, doesn't mean it doesn't work. If you find any insecure part of the code, feel free to exploit it or fix it :) A secure layer, like blockchain, is slow. A fast/instant/free layer, is insecure or centralized. So by "centralizing" it to a blockchain, using it as a "Court system", you get the best of both worlds. 
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Why doesn't your bank pay you interest for cash in your own pocket?
When you download your Bitcoin Wallet app (Coinomi or Bitpay, for example) the bitcoin is stored locally on your phone, not online. Bitpay does not have access to it, and if you delete the app, the bitcoin is gone forever (if you didn't back it up).
That's the beauty in it. Digital Currency can be hit or miss, but this is "Digital cash" because YOU have control. If you export your wallet keys and import into another app or program, it still works.
And the wallet company has no access or control, it's stored on your phone, and the app holder doesn't need to even have a server.
Coinbase, for example, is much like taking cold, hard cash, and putting it in a bank Safety Deposit Box, trusting them with it not to lose it or have it stolen. But at the end of the day, it's Cash in digital form, in that you don't have to give up control.
I guess if you "Deposit" it, they could pay interest, but it's not stable enough yet.

My statement came directly from my own understanding of physics and thermodynamics, and I know it to be true. I am an electrical engineer.
However, here is a quick link I found with a Google search that shows someone doing a real-world test, and if you look, the graphs are very slightly different because the computer had to be manually adjusted to draw the same wattage.
Their conclusion? A space heater and a gaming computers have exactly the same efficiency if you're trying to produce heat. That's not to say that all computers are just as efficient as each other, because some computers might do more computational work on the same eletricity, but computers themselves, about 99.9% of all the electricity that goes into it comes out as heat. The point of making smaller and more efficient processors is so that they waste less energy as heat, therefore using less energy. 
No there are a very small amount of electrons that are stuck in 2 NAND Gates or flip-flops circuits, those circuits to take a tiny bit of energy in order to flip them, but then again, it makes heat and a tiny amount of EM radiation.

No, it just exists as a new coin.
Bitcoin Cash forked into a new Bitcoin Cash, the people who refused caused the old Bitcoin Cash to exist (Who renamed to Bitcoin Clashic).
It wouldn't block anything. It just means whoever jumps to the new coin uses the new coin, or some would stay on the old coin.
If people jump to the new forked coin, the original chain and people would still call it Bitcoin. The new coin would get a new name. Nobody would agree to make more than 21M coins, because there is no need. It's like saying "How many trillion dollar bills exist in the world?"

In short, lightning network works like a centralized Network.
Like PayPal, it relies on a central entity in order to mediate transactions and make sure that they are accurate.
However, that Central entity is actually the blockchain, something that everyone can trust, because it is decentralized.
Basically, it uses the blockchain as a court system, because blockchain is basically infallible and impossible to hack or cheat for all practical purposes. If we both have a dispute over the balance, then we can submit a transaction. The person who is correct gets all of the money in both sides, such that there is no reason for someone to try and submit a fake transaction, knowing that they are going to lose all of their money doing so. 
At the end of the day, lightning network is secured the same way Bitcoin is. I'm making it so expensive to try and hack someone, that in the tiny chance that it does succeed, it's not worth it. Bitcoin is hackable, if the eight richest people in the world pools their money to buy hashing power, they could fuck the network up for only 850 billion dollars. But they'd not gain anything from it. Lightning network is the same effect, it's just not worth it by any means, because you'd have to crack the "judge/court" which is the blockchain. This allows lightning Network to be extremely fast, like a trusted system, but still secure. It's trusting the blockchain, which is trustless. This is why it's called a second layer, because it is adding a layer on the Bitcoin, using the security of bitcoin's blockchain as a foundation, and using. In order to trust so that it can be very quick without having to trust each other.

There are about 50 places within 20 minutes of me that accepts Bitcoin. Most of the small fast food places just have Coinbase on a smartphone, and watch you scan it (just a kind of simple way the owner can accept) but some (like Eddy M's cafe) will automatically pop up a QR code that will automatically include the total so you send the right amount.

They charge the MERCHANT, but you better believe they pass it to you! Gas stations just tell you a higher price for cards, but Walmart increases the prices of their products by a few percent to compensate. You pay either way, since the card company earns 3% of every transaction people pay with their cards, that's how they can afford to give tons of CC rewards even to people who never pay interest since they pay their card in full at the end of the month (Like me)

@_date: 2018-03-28 09:08:53
Ok, well the block size is 1mb. Segwit changes the way signature data is stored. This means that legacy nodes will still see 1mb, while new nodes will see all the data, and see the full 2.1mb (or whatever size) of transactions. With 100% Segwit use, the max weight (like size, but it's called weight because the total data is 4mb) is going to be 4mb. 
The block size is going to be up to 4mb, while before, it was up to 1mb (typically less, depending on how many transactions there are to fill the block)
With Segwit, the max blocksize (well, weight, but for most purposes, same thing) is going to be 4mb, but even with full blocks, this is going to be somewhere between 1024kb and 4096kb depending on what percentage of those transactions are Segwit transactions. But 2.1-2.5mb blocks are being mined, and that will increase to it's theoretical maximum of 4mb.

Upvote for a real question.
Fees are low now, but obviously there is a problem. Lower fees are awesome!
Miners form a balance. If bitcoin fees drop, profitability drops a little bit. They already have the mining hardware, so as long as they can make any profit, they will still mine. If it becomes unprofitable, then fewer people will mine, which reduces the amount of people mining, lowering the difficulty, raising the fee, and then increasing the reward so people come back.
Long term, bitcoin mining form a balance.

If you don't want to use Segwit (For whatever reason, nostalgia or just because you're too lazy to implement it) then don't use it! You still get the benefit since the mempool will be less congested by others. 
Bitcoin Cash is like Record/Vinyl. It's Nostalgic and old and easy to understand how it works.

We have up to 4MB blocks (Kind of, it can hold 4mb worth of transactions but technically old nodes see 1mb). Sure, it's not 8MB, but 4MB is half of that. We can increase it later if we want too WITHOUT a fork!
It will only be 4MB if all transactions use Segwit, but if 50% use it, it's going to be 2MB.

WTF? This isn't socialism. Also, I don't know why people get this. 
Everyone is either a communist or a socialist, and you can't be neither (well maybe anarchist but it's more between both)
Communism: The means of production and factories and businesses are owned by the govornment, who holds all businesses. 
Socialism: the means of production, like factories and stuff, are owned by people as a whole on a free market. 
It's such a blanket term though, you can be capitalistic which would fall under socialism, but again, it's a scale. But most people are socialist, since it's the people who own businesses. 
Communism rarely lasts more than 10 years, it doesn't work outside of any but the smallest Amish communes. 
The USA is a Socialist Republic. Not a democracy, since people vote for Representatives who vote on their behalf. This isn't a bad thing. A decent amount of capitalism is good, it keeps an open and free market, driving price down. Taxing carbon is because it prevents businesses from taking the cheapest route of dumping pollution everywhere, because there is no financial incentive not to, bit other than that, I think it works well.
No system is perfect, but I think our Socialist Republic system works pretty damn well.
Cuba (Calles themselves socialist, but they are communsit) works, but harely and is falling apart. European countries and North American countries are for the most part a capitalistic Socialist Republic, (Canada is a democracy since each vote counts as a vote, instead of an electorial College) but overall it seems to work.

Android operating system is open source, but most manufacturers actually have some closed-source software and changes to Android that you're not able to see.
If you're using a community version of Android, then you are probably using open-source software. If you're using the Google apps no, then those apps are not open source. You probably flashed the OpenGAPPs zip in recovery, and not all of that is open source.
The Google Play Store, if you have it, is definitely not open source. The operating system is, but not the entire image that is running on your phone.
And while it is true, it's possible to release open source software without free libraries, changelly (maybe Shapeshift, I'm not sure) does not allow you to integrate their exchange into your app and still keep it open source.

Nope. Pretend you use one wallet (ledger) for all transactions and another for cold storage. You use Ledger to pay everything. 
That's how LN works. 
If you have a LN wallet with 3 channels open, and keep all your money in it, you will be fine. If you get payment from one channel, you can move it to the other channel off the blockchain and for free, to refill. You can use Ln For everything and just move around your money within that. Then you'd never need to open a channel again or close it or need to keep refilling it.

We already did increase it. Bitcoin Cash supporters claim it's no possible, but we are already mining 2MB blocks. That's exactly what Segwit is for. We never want to fork the coin, we want to remain the original Bitcoin.
If you use the software from before BCH or Segwit existed, it STILL works, on Bitcoin Network, even if it doesn't support Segwit. The cool part of Segiwt, it increased the block size (Weight, effectively the same thing, since 4 times more data can be fit into the same block) and nodes who don't update the software still work totally fine :)

Bitcoin has 4MB blocks now... We have Segwit. Sure, old nodes see it as 1MB, but some 2MB blocks are already being mined. This means that we can increase block size without a hard fork, using consensus :)
A LOT of work went into increasing the block size without making an alt-coin. Both can't be the original, dividing the community.
Bitcoin got it's 4MB blocks and will increase if needed, because we don't want huge blocks (Leads to centralization, since BCH requires 8 times the CPU, Hard drive, memory, and network power as BTC, so it eliminates a lot of the small nodes, leading to centralization.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:22:03
No, it's not :/
That's the point. It's set up so that it will cost you to even attempt to hurt the network. This example might be bad because someone might be getting paid to murder a CEO or something, but you get what I'm trying to say.
Not only do you lose your block reward, miner fees AND you must waste a ton of electricity, but the reward will always be way lower than this, by many orders of magnitude. 
If people stop mining lowering the hash rate, the miner fees go way up. This means you'd make $240,000 or so just mining legitimately, and it would cost $200,000 in electricity, for solving a single block. But you only have a chance to solve it. You'd give up thousands of $240,000 (give or take) reward thousands of times to steal around $240,000 one time. It's like saying "Here is a lottery ticket. It cost $10, and if you win, you win $1,000. There are 1 trillion lottery tickets in the world, so good luck!

Currently, mining private keys is still only 2% ROI on the most efficient ASIC miners. AKA, the amount of electricity used would cost a lot, and even if you got every single bitcoin wallet ever, you'd only make 2%. Only for proof of concept. That's it.
The 6 richest people in the world can also create a longer chain if they invested in mining equipment, it's just not worth it.
Luckily, there are upgrades that can change to Proof of Stake or others instead, that would fix the quantum computer issue. Or a different type of encryption that isn't stateless. Especially salted by hash attempts, etc would help.
There are already proposed solutions should quantum computers powerful and cheap enough become a reality.

Well no, you only need to do that when you have the app open. Otherwise, the ONLY thing you need to do is listen for your peer updating the channel state, or check the blockchain every 8 hours, which would suffice. You can update everything else when the app is open, but channel state triggers are it, for each of your peers with channels to. 
It really isn't that complex. 
I personally have about 0.2 BTC total across 3 channels. I use Eclair for Android, built for mainnet. I can send you the APK. 
Look at the source code. It checks every 4 hours, and only holds a wakelock for about 1.5 seconds. In the meantime, the brilliance of the internet is that it doesn't need to be listening all the time, because if the peer wants to make a change to the channel, the app can detect that, wake up, and then go back to sleep. It takes 1/2 a second. Hardly any battery usage. 
It's like your messages app. Your text message app doesn't stay awake the whole time, it is waiting for a trigger before it runs, specifically, SMS incoming. It wakes up, alerts you, does it's thing, and is suspended. 
If you're a hub, sure, it's going to be kept awake. But you can opt not to route payments through yourself, or only when there is a greater than specified fee for profit. 
Opening a channel with 10c is worth it, because fees are 1c right now.

The law of thermodynamics means that all power consumed goes to heat anyway. May as well put it to use. If you are going to get an electric space heater, using a cryptocurrency miner that draws the same power will produce the same heat and you get to mine cryptocurrency at the same time. That being said, it's only cheaper if the replacement is an electric heater. If you are using it to replace a gas heater, gas is usually cheaper for the same Heat.

Same. But I also don't think it's immoral, if you pay the fee. It should be designed to be a fair market. Even a $0.02 fee means someone would have to give lots of money to miners to process those fees, which mean more people will come and mine, which means more hashing power, more security, and a larger market share. That's the point, right?
If the block limit was removed, I would gladly spend $1,000 creating a 10gb block just for shits and giggles, because why not? It would be funny, and they'd all be confused as to what happened? That means every single node just wasted 10GB of hard drive space. The best part? If I use many many outputs, and even leave one unspent, the block can't be purged (Until every output in the block is spent) so every node will forever have a 10GB file taking up space forever!

Lightning is not built by companies. 
The problem is that without a finalized and scaleable version of LN, it will be resistant to new changes that break the old rules (Meaning it's not backwards compatible.)
LN is in it's infancy.
And of course, the elephant in the room:
If there is a bug on Mainnet software (Not LN protocol, which is mathematically safe, but the software has a bug) and people start losing money to exploits, this is going to tarnish LN and give BCashers something to scream about.

@_date: 2018-03-29 03:51:48
Correct, you submit an on chain transaction to initiate the close, and fees are reimbursed to you from the unresponsive person's Ln Channel, which incentivises them not to go offline or be unresponsive 
So I can actually merge a channel open and a transaction at the same time. So let's say I want to buy something from you. I'm going to pay you anyway, so I can pay you and also open a channel at the same time. I set the timeout to 3 months. This means that if there are no transactions between us or routed between us for 3 months, the channel will close. Every time we do a transaction, that time is reset. We both can mutually agree on a timeout period. 3 years works pretty well, but so does a week since it resets with each transaction. We both ALSO specify a Lock period, which is separate. Let's say we set the lock period of 3 days. 
If all of a sudden, you want to close the channel, you can specify a soft close, in which you send me a signed transaction with our current balances, and if I agree it's correct, I sign it and send it back (also submitting myself if I want, but it doesn't matter) which means the channel will close in a single block confirmation, and then I get my money, and you get yours. 
If you ask me to sign the closing transaction, and I refuse, or I am offline and don't do it, you can do a "force channel close" which is locked without the peers key, to the pre-set lock period. We set it to 3 days (well it's based off block height). 
Now because YOU forced the channel close on ME, I must pay all transaction fees for both sides since it's my fault I was unresponsive, and it comes out of my own LN balance (until it's zero, then the rest of the blockchain fee is yours). What happens though, is that you could have submitted an old signed transaction that shows you have more. Now there is a 3 day wait period. 
Now if I come online and see 1 day left in the timeout, I have 2 options. I can either ignore it and let it close on it's own, or I can sign the close transaction in order to unlock both of our funds. 
If I come online and I see that you submitted a fake transaction, I can actually submit my own transaction (proving that there is a later transaction) and then I would get all the funds on the channel, yours and mine. This means even if I go offline, you won't submit a fake transaction unless you're 100% sure that I will not come back online. 
The time lock is just to give me some time to "take it to court" if it's wrong. If we both submit different states, whoever has the later transaction will get the enitre funds in the whole channel, instantly too!
Now, I know it's not perfect. If someone went offline, you would have a 3 day waiting period before you can move those funds, but the other person would actually be on the hook for all fees, which incentivises the peer to close the channel when requested. 
If I go offline temporarily, for only a week, there is the possibility that you can submit a close with an old transaction, which means you're trying to scam me. But you don't know for sure I won't come back online. If I come online for 1 second within that time out, my wallet is going to immediately submit a transaction as a penalty and get all your funds. 
Lastly, I can also request a Lock time increase, and you can either agree, or close the channel. If I know that I only have internet once a month, I might set the time lock to 40 days. You may not be willing to open a Channel with me in this case, unless I have a lot of funds at stake so they are sure I won't abandon it. 
If you have two channels open, you can actually move funds from one channel to another without even using the blockchain, which is also new.
The BOLT reference protocol is much different than the original lightning proposal, especially with atomic transactions, which let's me send 10 BTC to someone THROUGH you, even if you have only 1BTC. This was not possible previously, but now, the wallet apps can just send signatures abck and forth 10 times so that I can send 1BTC at a time, you rebalance, then I keep sending one at a time, until it's complete, even if you didn't have 10 BTC available. It's also called Atomic, because it either succeeds or fails, with no partial sends. It's not possible for you to send the first 4/10BTC then stop, that would render the receiving end invalid, which means no money would transfer. It's all or nothing. 
All of the previous pitfalls of lightning Network, such as requiring your funds to be locked up, or requiring your peers to have significant balance in order to route your transactions, have actually been solved with the BOLT standard. Unfortunately, it is more complicated than the initial implementation. For example, sending a lightning transaction would only use about 1.2kb of data, and now it uses almost 2kb+128 bytes per hop. It's not a big deal to most people, but the bandwidth usage is higher.
This means that people in rural areas with very slow internet would not be able to run a hub or a well connected node. If you only had a 1mb connection, you used to be able to handle a few hundred Ln Transactions per second, but now it's only about 60. 
On the plus side, it's much more flexible, and has almost none of the pitfalls of the original lightning Network proposal.

At the moment, no legal implications. But keep in mind, the robber would literally be handing hos private keys to enter the building, if that makes sense.

Why would you ever open a channel with a 1 year n-lock timeout fee? Just like why would you send a 10 bitcoin fee with a transaction? It makes no sense. Solution? Don't open a channel with that high n-lock time. Make it like, IDK, a week. You can still have the channel open for 100 years, or 5 years, because the timeout is different than the N-lock time. N-lock time is the delay between you FORCING a channel closed, and it closing. 


Yes you do, you must ask the node to propagate the transactions and the miners to mine, by paying them to do so with fees.


Yep, just like in theory, I can figure out your address and social security number from here. It's just not feasible.


What? No, you can move your money from one channel to another without using the chain, with a fee between 1 satoshi and -1 satoshi.


Edit: also you cannot open that many channels. 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 is more then the maximum number of satoshis that will exist
In case this was not clear, I was making a point. 


Why keep bitcoin in a wallet, it can be hacked? /s


Then NOBODY WOULD USE THAT HUB! They'd lose all transaction fees and everyone would close their channel, getting their money back after the n-lock time if they didnt cooperate. 
Besides, nobody COULD use the hub that required that, because wallets don't support sending messages like that. So no, dude. Or I will just type in "Reasons". Not no, it's encrypted either way, in that the hub can't see who it's from or to. The hub can't require a note to send it anyway, because they can't expect you to know, because they don't know the difference between you sending and you routing. 


You are thinking of TOR routing. Onion Routing simply means that it's encrypted in a way that each node doesn't see where it's source is, it only sees the amount, and who to forward it to next.
Yeah, much of your text is built off of misunderstandings. Let me know if this clears it up, or what is unclear enough that you need me to explain further.
Otherwise, it's not worth my time. I have about .4BTC on LN at the moment, because I understand why it is safe, and nobody has had funds stolen so far yet.

When it's in the mempool, it shows up on most wallets as "unconfirmed". It's a tip, and my point is that nobody is going to go through the effort of giving someone an OPTIONAL tip, then try and double spend it. This is my point, that in this case, it doesn't matter.

Well, it's just a method of having a completely distributed decentralized Network that can automatically detect every other node without even needing to have a list of IP addresses for scan.

If you used the S9 ASIC miner to try and break my wallet (the most powerful on the market  ) it would take 1.3 million years to have a 50% chance of getting it. And a shit ton of electricity. 
In order to double spend a transaction, you'd have to make a chain longer than the other chain, which means you'd need 51% of the hashing power, which is currently drawing 0.3% of the world's power, and is more powerful than then top 100 computers in the world times 40,000. You'd need supercomputers to hack Bitcoin, by creating fake transactions and solving the blocks yourself consistently to make a longer valid chain.

The attack works by first training the miners to ignore signatures in segwit extension blocks?
There is no extension blocks in segwit.
a segwit tx (without signatures) can be published stealing the anyone-can-spend output?
Such block would be rejected by all segwit enforcing nodes.
Once again, the mistake is to think that miners can change the rules at their convenience.
Even if you consider they do (which is wrong), you then have to explain why segwit is more dangerous than P2SH. If you can't find an explanation, then segwit does not add any additional hole that did not exist before.
I hear Rizun already "But P2SH you need the redeem script". Yes, but the miners know the redeem script as soon as you try to spend your output, so he would have control of your money as much as segwit output. (again, assuming that miner can dictate the consensus rules, which they can't)
If you publish your block without witness data it will be rejected by the network. You can't publish segwit data separately from your block.
Chain 1 is 50 blocks ahead of chain 2, but currently doesn't have the missing witness data published.
If segwit is activated Chain 50 is completely ignored by everybody.
If you are talking about SPV, then P2SH have the same issue. Chain 50 is using only the preimage of the P2SH script, while chain 2 also include the signatures.
Now, lets say I publish the witness data to chain 1. BAM. Your node has just be reorged. It is longest perfectly valid chain. Sure, it wasn't BEFORE, but it is now, because I published the witness data!
What you are describing is no different from a miner with majority hash power secretly mining, and publishing all at once for provoking a reorg. What does segwit has anything to do with it?

Also, there, they rarely enforce copyright laws, which often leads to less innovation incentive.

You can still own guns here, you just can't conceal carry. You are required to register all firearms, and also take a gun handling test first. If you can't pass it, you must take a firearm course until you can pass it. 
Not really that difficult. It's really about as easy to get guns here as in the Midwest as long as you have never been convicted with a gun crime (Even carrying illegally), drunk driving, or domestic violence, or a violent crime. Fair rules if you ask me.
I get that a lot here, people think California bans guns, or it's hard to get. It's really not. Your FIRST gun, you must wait 10 days to pick it up, but that has reduced the gun crime a lot. (1/2 of premeditated murders occur when one is angry, purchases a gun, and uses it within a few days. This is a "cool off" period)
It's totally fine, the lifestyle isn't for everyone, but there isn't a reason why you couldn't live in, say, Bakersfield for example. Sure, it's all open land and pickup trucks, but... Well I see your point. Even a similar area as the midwest is 30% more expensive.

Kind of. I say that because on conventional computers (not using quantum tech) it's between 98.5% and 99.99% depending on the computer. I'm not talking about amount of power used for computation, but the amount of power that ends up as heat out the back of the computer. The energy goes somewhere: Radio frequency if you have wifi (very little, ends up as heat since it works the same as microwave) sound (ends up mostly as heat as it's absorbed as friction) and light (which is so little it's hardly any)

I personally don't use cash, and I haven't in a while. Since 90% of US dollars do not have any cash to go along with it, and it's only numbers in a computer, I think it's safe to say that cash is dying.
I personally would rather not accept cash, but I would accept cash if they're willing to pay 10% over. Realistically, it's easier to also look at data about repeat customers as well.
There are a lot of reasons to use anything except for cash, but the only reason to use cash is because some people only have it and that's the only way that they can pay you. There is no reason for a business to prefer cash.
Plus, having a cash register increases the business insurance by a non-trivial amount, then having a pure card business. For high-class restaurants, it's actually likely to be a big enough difference that it is aften less expensive for a business to Simply accept no cash and the Savings in other costs offset the loss in business.

Well I'm in California, and Tesla superchargers are 100% pwoered by renewable energy contracts, and solar. California is already mostly renewable. 
Besides, even with a coal plant, gasoline makes 40 times as much carbon dioxide per mile as coal plants do (more efficient in scale).
It's not just Tesla's. The original Prius? Well... The NiMH batteries are TERRIBLE! Modern LiFePo4 batteries are efficient. After 145,000 miles a Tesla offsets the CO2 of a 2015 Honda Civic. 
Replacing your car with a Tesla is bad, but if you're going to get a new car, getting a Tesla pays for itself after 210,000 miles and offsets CO2 after 145,000 to 235,000 depending on the kind of vehicle you're comparing it to. (Fuel and manufacturing). 
After 200,000 miles, your only maintnence is tires, washer fluid, and... That's it! At 500,000 miles, it's the motor bearing.

2.2mb block. 
Here is a block with my transaction, but there are many more also. 
Old nodes only see 1mb, because the rest of the data is omitted, but updated nodes can see all data. Including the signature data. 
It's based off of concensus. The block size will increase with the adoption of Segwit, up to a maximum of 4mb when 100% of transactions are Segwit.

It's difficult. Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, all were Autistic. A high functioning form of Autism called Asperger's. 
Pros: Good at logic, math, science, and good at problem solving. Generally very high IQ.
Cons: No social Skills... This is what makes school so hard. I switched school twice for bullying. I take everything literally and don't understand how people work. This, along with constant misunderstandings about Autism ultimately leads to isolation, which would not be so bad, if the rest of the world would leave us alone...
It's unfortunate, but people don't understand what Autism is or what it means for most people. 1/68 children are Autistic, although often, Aspies are undiagnosed, and sometimes, you can tell. I certainly can tell within a few minutes of meeting someone, depending on their word choice and bow they form their thoughts into words.

Sounds like you don't understand Segwit at all, because this is false...
SegWit does not remove signature data from transactions. SegWit creates a bigger block, and in the bigger block all transactions contain signatures. Transactions without signatures continue to be invalid and signatures continue to be committed in blocks.
SegWit allows partial validators who do not check signature validity to do so without downloading the signatures themselves. This does not make invalid transactions valid. It does not make invalid blocks valid. It does not make invalid signatures valid. It does not make transactions without signatures valid. It does not remove signatures from blocks, as all block content continues to be committed in the block header. SegWit simply lets you verify non-witness transaction data without downloading (then discarding) the witnesses, which solves the problem of light clients having to download things they don’t care about and can’t verify anyway.

Transaction fees have been between 1c and 3c for a month.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:34:13
That's just a side effect of the math used.
If father sends you 2btc then mother sends you 3btc, you have 5 total. The way to bitcoin Network verify transactions is by looking where you got it from. So if you want to buy something for 4btc, it must use the 3+2 input and then output is 5btc total, split 4btc to the store and 1btc back to you. If it was only 1btc, you can't use either of the 2 input you got, either spending 2 and getting 1 back as change or spending 3 and getting 2 back as change.
That's just how the Bitcoin Network what's setup, because it's how it's able to verify where you got the money from to make sure that you didn't just make up the coins from nowhere.

If you don't like the change, don't use that. It's as simple as that.
Just because you don't like Internet Explorer 9 doesn't mean you have to use it, even if the rest of the internet uses newer versions of web pages, your old Internet Explorer will work just fine.
If you don't use segwit, then there is no issue. You're not forced to use it, and the only thing that will happen is... Nothing. You will still get lower fees because other people use it and lower the fees for you, but you can still receive Bitcoin from people with a segwit wallet, and send it to people with a second wallet. it's like updating your web browser. You don't have to do it, you just won't get the newer features.
That's like saying you don't want to be on an internet where Netscape is still used. Well, that's out of your control, but it doesn't matter because it makes zero difference to you.

Pretend Bitcoin is cash. 
You COULD deposit the cash to a friend or bank, if you want, but if you're storing it it's yours. The wallet is like a flash drive. It's not online in the cloud. It's local. 
There ARE some places that can act like a safety deposit box, Coinbase does that and acts like a Bitcoin safety deposit box in exchange for some very high fees. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 02:05:05
Formaldehyde in missions happens when you put any hot thing (like Asic miner) near anything that's a specific kind of an adhesive. Wood table, most old wall paints, cardboard, and the stickers on the machine.
You're always supposed to take the stickers off of gpus and Asic miners, but I don't know if everyone does.
It's also only found in trace amounts.
Just normal space heaters have the same problem if you keep it close to a wooden floor or furniture.
Just like microwaveable popcorn USED TO be bad, and now it is not, due to changes in manufacturing methods and ingredients, computers made before 1992 would often be decontaminated with formaldehyde. Any computer after 1992 is safe, and now, NAND n-junction transistors are made with tolerances small enough not to require it. The glues CAN BE, but very trace amounts. Old hardwood flooring used epoxy that could be harmful when heated above 73°c, which means a hot enough GPU or ASIC miner placed on the floor, or close enough to an older piece of furniture, COULD release more than a trace amount. 
Heh, says the one who can't use a capital at the start of his sentence. Insulting me implies you're defensive, and therefore can't come up with any kind of argument. If you still think it's bad, get off your phone, computer, or whatever you're using then ;)
Lastly, you sound like a Trump supporter, but I'm going to check your history and see ;) I'm not on welfare, and it's likely I contribute more in taxes than you do.

What the heck? That wouldn't work, it requires WAAAAAY too many resources. 
I get the sarcasm, but the entire point of LN is to have a layer that is instant and is a low energy network that doesn't require CPU power!
A cell phone app node could handle a few thousand hubs, and could act as a hub. THAT is the significance. It moves the security off of the network onto the blockchain, which is allowed to be slow. 
When 2 people close the channels they can agree on the channel state. Whenever there is a disagreement, both peers can submit a closing transaction. Because the order can be proven, whoever has the later transactions get all the funds in both sides, which takes 2 block confirmations. Sure, it takes 20 minutes, but this is only if one side tries to spoof or fake the transaction, or lie about the channel state (which just means submitting an older channel state). So the scammer knows that it won't work, AND that he loses all the money from both sides, so why would he even ever do that? That's what is keeping it secure. In this way, it gets the security of the blockchain, but the speed of centralization. It is centralized, controlled by the blockchain, which is controlled by decentralized network.
Kind of like decentralization through Middleman.

The wallet should automatically detect an invalid state, but I know how difficult this is in reality.

Like I said, you won't be banned as long as you are factually correct and not lying or spreading bullshit.
The sock puppets and spambots spread lies. If anything was actually true, then we would actually like to hear about any verbal ability so that we can fix them. That's the beauty and open source software, especially for something like lightning which is in its infancy.
We've never seen anything yet, but if they ever post something that is factually correct about a vulnerability and lightning, then we all want to know about it so that we can get it fixed soon.
It's not okay to lie at all. Some people support Bitcoin cash, yet still have more then 3 brain cells. Some people still support bcash because they believe that it is the original generation, or because they believe it's not needed. For example, one of the arguments is fat lightning network is going to be more complicated. That is true. HTML5 is more complicated than the original HTML, but it's also much better. One of the arguments is that it's simply not needed, because for less than $10, most people are not going to send the effort to try and double spend. And some more than $10, people would simply wait for a confirmation.

I realize now my bias comes from the fact that I live in California, the home of Apple, Google, SpaceX, Tesla, Microsoft, Facebook, Dropbox, Twitter, IBM, Tinder, Pandora, Spotify, and basically every major startup you can think of. It's a state full of techies. While you can use that clean out a lot of local places, you can't in most States.

That makes no sense.
If the time lock was set to 1 weeks, the channel can still be open for a year. The time-lock is different than the channel Timeout. 
One specifies the maximum length of the channel, one specifies how long you have to wait to get your funds back.
Yes, you would open a channel for potentially years, knowing that you can close it that anytime.
fees have no factor in time lock lengths. 
You can open a Channel with a timeout of 5 years, and if the other peer doesn't respond, you can still close it within 24 hours.

You aren't a dev, I can tell.


You're DEFINITELY not a dev... The "Hack code" was brilliant. Handle 4 times the transactions without increasing bandwidth or HDD space? Also without splitting it into 2 chains? Yes please!
Since BTC still works with older software, BTC is the real Bitcoin.
Hard fork is a fork that renders old transactions invalid. If a transaction was submitted using old software, a hard forked coin would not accept it, while a soft fork would.
This is why Segwit is a Voluntary Soft Fork.
And no, simpler means increasing a constant to 8 times the size, which means I need 8 times the HDD, 8 times the CPU, and 8 times the bandwidth to run a node.

In theory, yes. Someone would need to spend a few billion dollars on computers and control 50% of all of the hashing power in the entire Bitcoin Network. The only way would be the same way as reversing a transaction or changing the blockchain.
If somebody were willing to spend 100 million dollars a day on electricity, and then change the blockchain with fake transactions, yes. But it makes a lot more sense to use. Resources on something else, because the amount of money that they would get as much less than the amount they would spend.

True, but Antpool mined 6 blocks in a row a few times. But where is the incentive? Even without Segwit, this happened, you'd need to be a HUGE miner. Also, incentive. 
The miner would have to spend money on resources, THEN give up their block reward AND transaction fees (next to nothing now, but still). And the total cost and lost oportunity has to be worth the CHANCE of fucking something up.
It's secured the same as Bitcoin is: By making it expensive to defraud. I can steal your wallet from you, but I'd have to buy the top 509 supercomputers in the world combined and then spend billions on electricity to have a CHANCE to break your wallet.

I assume you are talking about the USA?
My comment was sarcastic. 
I believe that the only regulations in place need to be regulations that give a financial incentive not to harm people.
Let 2 companies compete for price. But also, provide financial incentive not to pollute. 
The way we do this now is with carbon credits. I'm going to make this overly simplified, but here it goes.
Every company gets 100 carbon credits, which means they are allowed to produce 100 tons of carbon per year. Any excess credits they have can be sold on the free and open market to other companies, at whatever cost you both agree on. 
If you need more credits, buy more. The credits expire after a few years, so companies who are clean can't just hoard them.
Every year, each company is given fewer credits. This means the price of credits slowly goes up, until eventually, it is more profitable to just reduce your carbon footprint than to buy more credits from someone else. This continues until companies either A: pay a very high fine (inelastic, means the industry is impossible to clean up) or B: pays other companies to suck in CO2 by chemistry or planting trees, etc.

Yes you can.
If your channel is too large, but you want to send a smaller amount to someone following protocol, it will still work. Additionally, BOLT is defined clearly, but only the code has this limit. The reference implamentation does too. The protocol doesn't.
If you don't want to change a single line of code, you have the option of just using the blockchain for anything over $1, 000.
The most I've ever sent was 0.75btc from one lightning wallet to another as a test, and while it's not a lot, it's enough for me to confirm that it works fine. although this was on software that was more recent, and have since had that limit removed.

Segwit is like increasing the range on your car by making a more efficient engine. Block increase is like increasing the range by building a bigger fuel tank. 
Segwit is more difficult, but increases capacity without operating cost increase. 
Why would you build a bigger fuel tank and keep increasing it? The best way long term is to increase the engine efficiency as much as you can, then increase the fuel tank. Then youre paying less for fuel (nodes, bandwidth, miners and cost of running it)

Again, this is just the default. 
Rusty mentioned the 32-bit value (“amount_msat”) in the protocol for HTLCs: this restricts any single payment to 4294967295 millisatoshi. This was agreed early on between Tadge, Joseph and Rusty and confirmed in the Milan Summit, but it’s worth delineating the reasoning behind it. Channels themselves are actually limited to 4x that amount, but that’s a simpler thing to change.
If you want to, you can change this limit yourself and build the client yourself. If both of us change it, it means we can send to each other easily. This is based off of concensus. By default, yes. But any and everyone can manually set this limit at any time per client. 
That is a recommended value for now, but if I wanted to only open a channel to someone who has less than 0.001 but more than 0.000999, I can choose to do that. 
This isn't a hard limit. If I change this and you change this default and build it (less than 5 minutes) then we'd be able to send as much as we want. Even to anyone else who also has this set to a range that is valid.

Yes, but the buses are owned by someone else, the city or a centralized company.
That's my point. The claim is that a bus is more efficient.
But it's not practical for every single person to have a bus, now is it? It's no longer Peer-To-Peer. Buses use a lot of fuel, expensive to maintain, and is only worth it if it's full.
Well, that means one person has the bus and everyone else uses it.
This is the point I am trying to make. 
I know you're being sarcastic, but I know that SOMEONE is going to make this claim.

Why do I hear "Added/removed 0-conf" a lot?
0-conf transactions are not secure on an RBF transaction, but that is it. RBF is an optional feature, and when broadcasting the transaction, you can either choose to broadcast RBF flag or not. Nobody uses RBF currently. CPFP doesn't affect the merchant either.
0-conf transactions are exactly as secure on both BCH and BTC. Actually, arguably more secure on BTC simply because there are many more nodes. And the reason why it's secure on BCH is because it doesn't have RBF transactions, and nodes won't hold 2 transactions in the mempool that use the same UTXO's. Guess what? Bitcoin doesn't either! Bitcoin nodes won't accept or broadcast a transaction if it sees another one first using the same UTXO. This makes 0-conf just as secure on both chains, as long as the transaction broadcasted isn't an RBF transaction (Which can be seen). As a merchant? "We accept 0conf for non-RBF Legacy and Segwit, but we require 2 confirmations for an RBF transaction."
Simple enough. RBF transactions are rare anyway, and most wallets don't even let you send an RBF. If you send a non-RBF transaction, it's impossible to use RBF on it unless it's set before hand (Also changing the hash).
TL;DR: In reality, zero-confirmation transactions are either secure on both chains, or insecure on both.
In general, transactions less than $10 worth are fine, $20 are mostly fine, but not trustworthy for more than that.

No, if you send 10,000 0.7 satoshis over lightning, they are automatically added together to be 700 satoshis, and when you finally close the channel, you have 700 satoshis. 
If I send you 0.6 satoshi 5 times, when we close, it will close with you having 3 satoshi. 
If I sent it to you 6 times, you would have 3.6 satoshi, which means as soon as we submit it to the blockchain, I would actually be sending you 4 satoshi, still a tiny tiny amount. 
But if you get 101 0.01 satoshi, you will now have 1.01 satoshi, and when you close the channel, you withdrawl that.
If you wanted to do that, in theory you could, but youd have to close and re-open the channel 10,000 times and eat the fees.
LIGHTNING lets you use partial satoshis, but since Blockchain doesn't, it would round it out to go to the blockchain.
So no, this won't work this way. You misunderstood.

No, it does not spy on you or listen to everything. In fact, you can even measure the chips. It draws more power when just listening. It actually has a dedicated Hardware chip that specifically listens for a keyword, which then wakes up the processor. This means that it literally is not broadcasting or storing anything's, and nothing's being written to the ram. This means that it is not spying on you and only listens once it makes noise and recognized a key word. People who rooted this and connect to it through a computer reverse engineered and saw what packets it is sending, and again, it only sends packets while it's lights are on showing it's listening, basically only after being woken up

How can it process 100 times the data? Your math doesn't add up. 
Bitcoin Cash 8mb blocks can hold double Bitcoin's 4mb blocks, but it isn't as efficient. Bitcoin Cash handles double the transactions for 8x the resources. Bitcoin testnet is 1 Satoshi oer byte, and Bitcoin is 3 Satoshi per byte. The fees are as low as BCH despite handling 11 times the transactions and 30 times the amount of outputs. 
Why would you spend 8 times the resources to get double the capacity?
It's not that I am against the block increase, it's just... What the fuck? FlexTrans fixes the mallability, but Segwit does the same while increasing block size without increasing chain size, meaning the nodes still process 1mb to hold the 4mb blcok weights. 
Just think, what if Bitcoin Cash just implemented Segwit, then they'd not have to fork again (because now there are already 2 separate Bitcoin Cash chains who fight, BCH and Bitcoin Clashic) and they'd get 4 times the space. 
Plus, they'd be able to use LN, which is capable of competing with Visa in it's current form.

Which is exactly why there are more than A-E. You can use other channels until you get it in a triangle, or if you're a hub who thrives on liquidity, just run 3 nodes with a few channels between them so there is always a triangle.
My point is that if I choose to, I can make sure that a LN transaction will never fail because of ME, and that I will ALWAYS be able to route the transactions regardless of my channel states.
Otherwise, that's exactly why you can choose a route that CAN route it.

I disagree with them, and I can back it up. I know that in it's current form, LN can compete with Visa, while no other coin can. I also know that to compete with Visa, the block size needs to be 1.3gb per block, which means you need to have hyper fast internet and centralized nodes due to cost. 
I know it's not the solution, but it's okay to be wrong. Flat Earthers are dipshits because it's so obvious they are wrong, but they are too stupid to know they are stupid. 
BCashers are dipshits for saying BCH is the original chain or is the real Bitcoin.
But just supporting a larger block size can be wrong, but doesn't mean they are dipshits.

It is exactly accurate. You need 16 times the amount of resources. 4 gigabytes is always going to be bigger than 2 gigabytes, it doesn't mean you need a new hard drive, it means you're taking up more resources on the hard drive.
If you're using hot your processor, and you double it so now you're using the whole processor, you now don't have any leftover CPU for other things, even if you don't need a new CPU. It is 100% accurate That 16mb blocks take 16 times the resources to run. Computational resources doesn't mean you need to buy more computers. 
Did you know that calculating Pi to the 1000th digit twice takes twice the resources as calculating Pi to the 1000th digit once? Wow! *Gasp* I didn't even need to buy a bigger computer for it!
But it is a basic fact that it does take 16 times the resources. This just makes running a node more expensive. It doesn't mean you have to buy a new computer. 
Driving to work once takes 1/2 the gas and 1/2 the wear and tear as going twice, but you can't drive half the car! You just use the same car less! Wow! Amazing how that works!

Bitcoin's 4mb blocks vs BCH 16? If you think it's that simple, no wonder!
Although block fees usually increase exponentially as you saturate the blocks more. Also, because a 16mb block size means the node needs to be 16 times the CPU, RAM, HDD, and network speed, it limits the nunber of people who can afford to run a node, reducing the network, causing increased latency for propegation, as well as broadcasting. A solved block is broadcasted, and if it's 16 or 32 MB, it's useless in places where 32mb take 10 minutes to transfer. Like much OF of the USA. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:38:11

BTC chain is 1MB blocks, but the reason some are being mined around 2-3 is because Segwit increases the max block weight to 4MB, taking the 4MB on disk. A block increase without a fork. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 18:21:06
The thing is, Bitcoin Cash doesn't even follow the whitepaper, so what does it matter? Bitcoin Cash uses a different difficulty adjustment algorithm, it implemented FlexTrans mallability fix (Basically Segwit without the efficiency improvements) and miners and nodes are separated now. 
Plus, Bitcoin Clashic is closer to the original than Bitcoin Cash! Bitcoin Cash forked, making a new coin. Then Bitcoin Cash forked again and stole the old Bitcoin Cash name, and left the old Bitcoin Cash (BCC) to rename to Bitcoin Clashic. 
So are you trying to follow the whitepaper or not? Are you using Bitcoin Clashic or not?
It's okay to prefer on-scale solutions. Sure, it can't handle 60,000 transactions per second like LN, and can't compete with Visa, but it works now, and you can just increase the block size making new forks and new old chains. Right? 
But don't pretend that everything BCH does is to be in Satoshi vision, because otherwise, BCH wouldn't have FlexTrans. How can Segwit suck, but FlexTrans be good? Same fix, but Segwit increased the block size to 4mb, but BCH didn't want the block increase through backwards compatible. 
Stop pretending Bitcoin Cash is Satoshi coin, or Bitcoin. 
Because if I boot up a 4 year old computer with Bitcoin on it, it connects up to Bitcoin network. Not Bitcoin Cash fork. Not Bitcoin Atom. Not Bitcoin gold. None.

While the first LN proposal incentivized large hubs, because it required capitol, this is no longer the case, since any non-zero channel can be used to route any amount of BTC with Atomic transactions.
Again, this was my concern, and was fixed on Testnet a while back. 
You will only need to do 2 transactions in your ENTIRE LIFE!
One to open the channel, do every transaction you ever need to do for free/near free, off-chain, or send money to standard on-chain address via 1 transaction, and then 1 transaction to close.
You only pay 2 fees for a lifetime of transactions. I opened one channel for only $4, and have left it open for about 3 months so far, doing all transactions, send and receive, on and off chain, within that channel. 
Funds are no longer "Locked" into the channels. What is, however, is a timeout for security. 
If we both have 5BTC, but I try and steal 1BTC from you, the blockchain detects this, and gives YOU ALL 10 BTC, but you have to wait 144 blocks (~1 day) before you get to keep the scammers money.
You can not steal LN funds unless you manage to both brute-force the hash of the closing transaction, AND double-spend the transaction. Which is just as hard as brute forcing someone's private key and then double-spending it.
So no, just no.
Seems like the first-generation LN whitepaper which was full of flaws left a bad stigma and seems like most people don't understand that LN now vs LN then is like BTC w/Segwit vs whitepaper. So much has changed, miners and nodes are separate now, etc.

Yes, I am young. But I am an electrical engineer. While I specialize primarily in battery management systems and power saving algorithms for CPU scheduling, I am still familiar with cryptography used in SSL, WPA2 security, salted hashes for web based security, and yes, even SHA256 algorithms used by many PoW based cryptogcurrencies. 
Although age has nothing to do with it. I'm not saying that you don't understand it because you're old, I am saying you don't understand it because you don't understand it. Most people don't, and that's alright. 
Proof of Capacity is likely going to be the choice of future cryptogcurrencies, as they are a zero-cost algorithm. (It does take electricity, but the algorithm doesn't). 
Your phone doesn't even download any blocks to it, it's just watching the chain via different services offered by nodes, and broadcasting signed transactions. Otherwise your wallet would take up 150gb and need to download constantly. Of course, this would be useless, which is why this was changed. 
Great, so you have 6TB. You can still only verify 1/16th of the transactions, OR 1/16th of the speed as you would on BTC. This is only a problem for nodes though.
What happens is nodes have higher operating costs, and so they will cost more in fees as the blocks increase, increasing demand on SHA256 hashing. 
And, nodes and miners now require internet speeds 16 times as fast. This means that places with 1-2mbps (40% of Americans), or on Centreylink (15%) who have a bandwidth cap, they will not be able to run BCH nodes, while they can barely run BTC nodes. Again, reducing true decentralization. (Although this isn't a big issue, centralized miners and nodes still are secure). This reduction in nodes just means the higher load on hashing or CPU is going to cost more in electricity to run hash functions to verify transactions, and then if it's not profitable, stop. Fewer nodes = increase in fees when blocks get full.

Upvoted for a valid question, but basically because Nano and BCH are only free because they have reasons. BCH is cheap because they handle WAY fewer transactions, and Nano is free because it removes security. It's good, but if I want to send money to you with Bitcoin, I can send to your address. With Nano, you HAVE to be online to receive the transaction at the same time. Also, unlike BTC, where you must mine to compete with the network ongoing, with Nano, you have an unlimited amount of time to work on cracking your own chain.

Running SHA256 algorithms on a 1mb block requires 512mb of ram, while running it on a 16mb block requires 8192mb, or 8gb of ram. 
You're DEFINITELY not a computer guy, because this is something any developer would understand. 
Running a wallet on either is going to be fine, just not a full node. This means the NODE has a higher cost, so as the sizes increase over time as saturation increases, nodes will only stay if it's profitable. 
You aren't running a BCH node, obviously. 
But if you were, it wouldn't be on a phone. 16mb is kind of the limit for a 1mbps connection to reduce orphaned chains due to block solve propegation latency.

Bitcoin Cash is pretending to be Bitcoin. When they straight up say "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin, Bitcoin is Bitcoin core", that's straight up pretending to be something it's not. 
Well apparently, Bitcoin Cash thinks Satoshi is wrong. Bitcoin Cash not only changed the way miners and nodes are separated (like Bitcoin), but also changed the difficulty algorithm.
Also, the FlexTrans fix broke compatibility making Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Clashic (Clashic being closer to Satoshi vision).
But get this. Did Bitcoin get invented when Bitcoin Cash forked? Or did Bitcoin get created by Satoshi? Which is it? Because if you boot up a bitocin client that existed from a year before the Bitcoin Cash altcoin fork... It still works. Even without Segwit support, it works. And it works on Bitcoin! It doesn't work on any altcoin. :)

It can't replace the blockchain because it needs a trusted central ledger. Credit Cards have Visa, PayPal has the company, etc. But Lightning needs a centralized, trusted entity to settle disputes. If I manage to catch you offline and submit an old channel states, your wallet will either sign the transaction if it wants to agree, or dispute it. The "theif" then loses all his money, because this "central ledger" solves disputes. Ever heard of Game Theory? 
Well this "centralized trusted company" is Bitcoin blockchain. We can trust that it will respond in a predictable manner. We know that it will not accept spent outputs, for example. 
It relies on Blockchain for security. 
Here is the thing: With any kind of payment system, you get to choose a balance of 3 things: Security, speed, and centralization. 
The more security you get, the less speed and more you must trust them. With Bitcoin, there is no trust, so you need to balance 2 things: Speed/capacity, and security. We can reduce the block time to 1 minute, but we increase orphaned chains. We can reduce the proof of work required, but it reduces security. 
The whole point of 2 separate layers, is that we can allow Bitcoin to be slow with confirmation times, and it doesn't matter. Bitcoin has great security, but if we wanted to compete with Visa at the current moment, each block would be 13gb of data average. That's 13gb you must upload and downlod every 10 minutes! 
The solution is to build a lightning fast miceopayment system that can't function on it's own, but trades "trust" for "speed". Like PayPal, Lightning network has a single centralized entity to solve disputes and to manage channels. This is what makes it so fast, cheap, and secure, by introducing a single controlling entity. 
But guess whst this entity is? Is it a company, like a bank? Nope! This central entity is the blockchain. The blockchain is the core of the security of LN. It's called a "2nd layer" because the whole point is that it is cheap because there is no proof of work! The reason why Bitcoin transactions cost is because electricity cost. With no proof of work on the layer 2 for LN, transactions are 1 Satoshi. Of course, the blockchain functions the same as it's always functioned. 
Essentially, LN is a network that is centralized to Bitcoin. 
The only way to have LN without using Bitcoin for it's trusted secure controlling mechanism is to control it by proof of work, which just makes a special kind of blockchain all over again. 
Just like you can't make a PayPal system without a central company (to prevent me from changing some numbers and stealing or inventing money), you can't make Lightning without a central secure "decision maker/company", which is the blockchain. 
Bitcoin Cash currently has FlexTrans, which removed the 4x efficiency boost and LN support (Time lock hash contracts and smart contracts was removed). But if BCH currently got Segwit, it would mean the 8mb blocks instead are 32mb (they do actually take more power to hash since the blocks actually are bigger, not just compressed) but the chain only needs to save the 8mb each. This means you can get 4x the size with no downsides, and then get LN implamented for microtransactions. Like sending one single Satoshi to someone. It's not worth it now, but I sent 1 Satoshi to someone for only a 0.3 Satoshi fee. And it confirmed in about 1 second. 
A micropayment channel layer was talked about by Satoshi, and Lightning is only one of the solutions. This is like saying "Wireless communications", which can be Bluetooth, wifi, etc. So there are other ways to implement it, obviously, and the current LN is different than proposed on testnet, but the reality is, if you want to handle 100,000 transactions per second, to compete with Visa, the block size is going to be larger than 1gb, which means it's not feasible, because only the top 2% of internet speeds can even run a node, and only large fast computers can verify the hashes needed, meaning only huge companies will afford the server-class computers. For now, while Bitcoin is small and hardly used, it could work, but long term, LN or another payment channels network is the only way to compete with Visa.

We believe in fully scaleable solutions..forking every few years isn't a solution. Lightning network in it's current form.can handle between 20,000 and 100,000 transactions per second...
Also, BCH forked again, the old Bitcoin Cash is now renamed to Bitcoin Clashic. BCH difficulty algorithm and the separation of miners and nodes mean BCH is not following the white paper.

Should be "having to use two on-chain transaction fees total for up to 99999999999999999999 transactions"
Bumping the block size is like building a new road next to the existing one. It means 8x the road maintenance (8x the cost to run a node because of 8x HDD, CPU, and network usage). Bitcoin nodes cost 1/8 of the resources to run. It also means it pollutes more (Huge chain which is permanently stored) etc. Segwit is more like making the car engines more efficient, use less fuel, use smaller cars to fit into smaller lanes on the same highway, and make the roads smoother so it's safer to drive at higher speeds, and automating the driving.
Well Lightning Network is basically like Visa, Paypal, or any other micropayment system. It can handle hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, with fees either zero or 1 satoshi per transaction. Payment Channels are the ONLY solution that will work for long term micropayments, and is the ONLY solution that is going to compete with Visa. Only instead of trusting Visa's ledger, it is simply trusting the blockchain.
Since LN is trustless, each middleman can't see who sent the transaction to who, or it's size. It knows that it had to transmit 3btc, but it just means the transaction is at minimum 3btc, maybe more, maybe less (If the sender also used part to do a re balance). This is because LN channels don't require a lot of funds anymore. 
If I send money through alice to you, how does that work? The original whitepaper requires that for me to send you 1btc THROUGH alice, Alice needs to have 1btc. Right? True, the whitepaper says that.
Atomic transactions have fixed this, which means that you can send through any non-zero channels with atomic transactions. This means if Alice has 1btc, I can sedn you 100BTC through her, but it would require a number of re balances. Because this requires 100 rebalances, this means the fee is going to be ~10 satoshi's instead of 0.1 satoshi. But it still works! 
The cool part? It's impossible for Alice to stop half way to break the transaction. Atomic Transactions either complete or fail completely, so it won't have any partial payments. This means the node/hub size is limited ONLY by network speed. If I have 0.0001BTC, I can route 1BTC in about 4 seconds, or 10BTC in 40 seconds. This is fairly slow, but if a "HUB" wanted to only have $20, they could run a hub with about 1,500 people with the average person sending 0.1btc and taking about 3 seconds.
This is the significance, that it works very similarly to Visa, but is decentralized, trustless, etc. 
2 transaction fees on chain is to open then close a channel. Guess what this means?
2 transaction fees, but you can do about unlimited transactions instantly in the mean time! Woohoo!
It's so sad to see people who think LN now is like the whitepaper, because the whitepaper version of LN sucked, led to centralization (Since someone would need lots of money to route transactions). These flaws have been fixed in testnet before release, and now, you can route 1BTC through someone if they only have 1 satoshi (Even though this would take 2-5 minutes) or if they only have 0.0001BTC (~$0.90) in about 20 seconds, where previously, it would fail if nobody has enough to cover it. 
Have you ever used LN? I can pay my phone bill by scanning a QR in 4 seconds fully confirmed for a 1 satoshi fee!

If we followed Wright Brothers definition of airplanes, in their vision, they would be twin prop, canard style stick and wood and canvas planes. 
Although it wasn't called "lightning network", Satoshi only mentioned "payment channels" a couple of times. 
Although if both the chains changed their code at the same.time, your statement would be accurate. But are you trying to tell me Bitcoin was invented by Roger Ver?
Because before Bitcoin Cash or Segwit existed, there was one Bitcoin, yes? Well even ignoring the fact that it was the minority that forked, the chain that changes the rules is the fork, while the chain that didn't is the original. 
Everyone has bitocin compatible wallet. A few people change their own software to fork the coin, but the Bitcoin stays the same. And yet Bitcoin is now changed? 
I can respect an opinion that on-chain scaling is the solution, even if as an engineer, I disagree. But I can't respect people who say Bitcoin forked from Bitcoin Cash, or that Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin. 
I don't hate Litecoin, Dogecoin, or Bitcoin Gold, because they don't lie about who they are or pretend to be something they are not. 
Litecoin technologically is more capable than BTC and BCH, since it can handle more transactions, faster, and has LN.

LN fixed this.Because LN channels can be re-balanced in a triangle from and to the same person, and because rebalancing is off chain, if I want to send 1 Bitcoin through you who only has 0.2 Bitcoin, I can still do it even without the liquidity. It just cost 20 hops (because I send through you, they rebalance, I continue sending, you rebalance) so that isn't an issue. Also, instead of 1 second, it would take closer to 6 seconds. 
And because it's atomic, if it gets interrupted part way it fails. It wither succeeds or fails, no partial completions. 
Atomic splits also lets you use the balance of 2 sepaprate channels together taking separate routes to make a payment which detects as one payment t, not two, and therefore is impossible for one to fail and one to succeed, preventing partial payments.
Brilliant, no?

It is a fork/altcoin PRETENDING to be Bitcoin. That's why I hate it. Not because the changes. Litecoin is a good coin, technically better than BTC. But if it pretended to be BTC, we'd all be pissed too. Litecoin got Setwit and LN first too! Litecoin is kind of like the Bitcoin Beta/Testnet.
I don't hate DOGE, but DOGE isn't worth anything as a currency either. That being said, I paid $1 for some DOGE and now it's worth about $100 and I am holding it cause it's a joke.

Well you need to use the blockchain if the other person manages to hack or fake a transaction, or to open and close a channel. Bitcoin secures it. 
You should try using LN. Seriously, download a wallet, tap "channels&gt;Connect to random" and it maps out the best person to connect to. 
Then send 1 Satoshi to someone via QR code. 
Also, you will need to use the blockchain if you want to send any sons to someone who does not have a lightning wallet. If I use LN, but someone doesn't accept LN, you can just pay the fee. 
Eventually, almost all transactions will be on lightning and therefore transaction fees will be low to do on chain. Just like you shouldn't accept 0-Conf for $10,000 transactions, you shouldn't use LN for $10,000 transactions, because if the other person breaks in your home and shuts down your wallet, deletes the backup, then brute forces your private key, they only need to solve the block once within 144 blocks, not compete with the network. So if they were to knock your computer offline for a full day and guarantee that you won't come online, then they could steal all funds in the channel you have with them. Of course, if you come online for 2 seconds within that time, you take all of their money. 
It is secured to the same way. Bitcoin is. I'm making it so expensive to try that it's not worth it.
1/10,000 might succeed, but that means that the other person had to lose all of their money and their wallet 10,000 times in order to steal the funds in your Channel with them just once.
In comparison, someone might be able to double spend a transaction once in 10,000 times, but it's just not worth the effort because by the time they succeed, they wasted a ton of electricity mining, which actually cost more than they'd ever hope to gain. Cause in theory, the 4 richest people in the world on Bitcoin, or the richest 1 person in the world on BCH, could just buy hashing power and destroy both networks out of spite, and destroy trust, etc. But they'd spend about 450 times more than they'd ever ever hope to ever gain, and on top of that, they'd have made more money just mining for the network. It's all about incentives.

Yes, especially since it confirms in that time, and in theory, each person can do 1 transaction per second for every 4 channels they have open. In it's current form, it can only handle 30% of all visa transactions, but if the amount of users increase by 740%, it means that it will bring the time per transaction down since routing is easier, AND will be able to handle as many as Visa.

1MB blocks that can hold 4MB worth of transactions. But the chain can be smaller and also allows old nodes to work without Segwit. 
BTC has 4MB max block size with 90% or above segwit adoption (Side affect of the complex math making Segwit backwards compatible)
Now, with about 60% adoption, it's 2.7MB max.
I think Bitcoin scaling solution of efficiency over simplicity is better. BTC and Lightning is more complex, but much better, efficient, and scale able. Plus you get a system able to compete with Visa. LN is as fast as Visa and instead of centralized/trusting a company, it is centralized/trusting the Blockchain!

Who claims it's like virtual gold? It's not. It's a currency. IDK where you're getting that idea from, but more merchants are adopting it. Even now, I can buy gasoline on Rancho Santa Fe road by my house with it, or Alberto's takes mainnet lightning network for Mexican food. Maybe it's just a California thing (we are the tech capitol of the world, apple, Google, Facebook, Tesla, SpaceX, Dropbox, etc). It you know. 
Lightning WAS done while changing the block size. Segwit both increased the maximum block size to 4mb while allowing LN. Old nodes see the original 1mb, but can't see much of the data. The point is that if you use a btc client that is a version before BCH or Segwit existed, it still works on Bitcoin, even without Segwit. If there was a fork, this would not work. An old client from way back in the day still works now with this solution, and didn't cause a fork or new coins. Just like btc vs bch divided the community, forking it would mean it would have a new ALTCOIN while Bitcoin was still Bitcoin. Segwit solution ensured that anyone who didn't want to use it didn't have to, and also applied to original Bitcoin. 
Also, lightning fixed its problems. For example, if I wanted to send you one BTC routed through a friend, I would send him 1btc and he sends you 1 btc, but it requires him to have 1 btc. 
With the Atomic transactions, Lightning Mainnet can route through any non-zero channel. For example, if our friend has 0.1btc on my channel and 0.1btc on yours, I can route 1btc through him, but he'd just route in a triangle to rebalance. We'd have to pay 2(1/0.2) hops, so we'd be paying for 10 hops, but the point is that it's currently possible to do for 1/2 cent fee. The LN that was launched on testnet evolved greatly, imporving many of it's problems and protocol limitations.

Oh no, it works totally fine to use BCH on a phone, that isn't an issue.
I am talking about miners. A phone isn't running a full node and therefore doesn't need 160gb to download to the phone :)
But even still, even if it is cheap, running a NODE costs 16 times as much on BCH as on BTC, period. 
You don't even need the entire blockchain on a phone since amy BCH apps only sign and broadcast transactions. Only a full node needs to use the space. 
Neither Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash nodes can feasably run on a phone, they just require way too much ram, CPU, and disk space to run. Your battery would drain in an hour. SHA256 algorithms use a lot of ram for even small blocks, and if you use the disk for paging, you're going to wear out an SSD pretty quick even with load-leveling on most NAND controllers.

"Centralized hubs" are still trustless. Nodes with lots of channels aren't "Centralized", since you can choose exactly where you want to connect your channels to. For example, if there is a really good coffee shop, it's not a "Monopoly" or "Centralized" just because they get a lot of business. Also, it's trustless, which means well-connected nodes are unable to see who sent, who received, or the amount. Atomic transactions with multiple routes just means a particular node knows that someone sent at LEAST 1btc if they route that, but it's source routed. You can route 3BTC through 200 people and through the same node 5 times and back to yourself, and the node wouldn't even know it.
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:35:38
Yes, but it rounds it up when you send to a chain address.
0.7 Satoshi is 1 Satoshi. 0.0001 Satoshi is 0 Satoshi. But if everyone uses LN, it doesn't matter. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:12:37
It depends on your particular routing.
If you only have a single channel, if the server is congested or busy, the LN Node can have a delay. Or, if their channel on the other side is low, they may need to do some balancing also. Also, while it's in beta, some nodes are not configured right. This means after 5 seconds, it tries another routing method, and another, and another, until it finds a route that works.
BitRefill also needs to process and save, they may have a system to back up channel state before responding with a "Received" signal, because unlike on-chain, where you can send to someone offline, LN requires the other end to be online. This means the other end's lag or congestion will affect anyone sending to them. 
If you use 2 channels, it will be faster, or you can wait until the network grows. Sometimes they can take up to 30 seconds to route, because the network doesn't route.
Also, routing algorithms take a LOT of CPU power, so an older phone will take up to a minute. It has exponentially high amount of possible routes which it needs to figure out. It's quite similar to Google Maps mapping algorithm, which can take a phone 30 seconds to calculate, but the server does in a second. But that's why when offline, Google Maps takes the simple route with freeways and main roads, and takes longer.

No, this is incorrect again. 
If I send you 10BTC, you can instantly send it to anyone else via LN, OR immediately send it from LN to a NON-LN address (But you'd need to pay the blockchain fee) and it doesn't even need to close the channel!
You can receive and send BTC to and from your LN channel the same way you do on blockchain, with a single blockchain fee. Think of the channel as a wallet.
You don't need to ever close the channel.
I send you 5BTC on LN, and within 5 seconds, you can either send it to another LN person OR another blockchain address. If your LN wallet/channels run out, just send BTC to that via EITHER LN or Blockchain.
You don't need to close the channel to release the funds ever...

It's Trustless in that you don't need to trust anyone but yourself. If you really want to, you can do send-only channels that don't require you to watch or monitor the channels too.

True, it's not the only way, but it's the best way while also increasing capacity by 4x without affecting permanent chain size. 
It also had time lock hash contracts, making micropayment systems possible. 
BCH explicitly removed these from FlexTrans to be "pure". 
FlexTrans doesn't support LN, Segregated Witness does.

Then if they try to route through me, it will fail. 
As for me losing funds? Id have to be in a dead zone for longer than the N-Timelock, which is 4 days by default. If I am offline for 4 days AND the peer submits a fake transaction and I don't come online within the 4 days after, then I am at risk, but the peer cant be sure that I won't come online within 4 days, and therefore won't submit an old channel state, or I get all the coins.
As long as you pop online at least 1 time every 4 days, there is no risk. If you don't, then it's very very very little risk. 
If you plan to be offline ofr a long time, close the channel or update the N-Lock time. 
So no, unless the tunnel takes you 4 days to get through, nope.

Both you and I have 5 bitcoin. 
You send me 1 Bitcoin so that you have 4 and I have 6.
You submit the old Channelstate so we both have 5, effectively stealing it back.
There is a 5 day lockout period before you can actually get the money back, and I can choose to sign the transaction and save some fees, or report it as fraud within that time.
I submit the penalty transaction, instantly getting all 10 BTC, leaving you with ZERO for trying to steal from me! I keep all of mine AND all of yours!
If you want to steal bitcoin, you must submit an old transaction and then hope that within 5 days, the other person doesn't come online at all. This means that you are not going to submit an old transaction unless you're 10,000% sure.
Maybe 1 in 1000 will succeed, but that means you lost 5BTC 1000 times to get 1BTC 1 time. It's called Game Theory.
@_date: 2018-04-30 03:42:05
No, you're not getting it. It's like choosing to take checks vs cash. 
If you are a merchant, just tell them you won't take RBF transactions. Most wallets don't even let you send RBF transactions anyway. Same as CPFP. If I send a transaction to you with my wallet, it does not let me replace it with another fee. RBF doesn't work. There is no way to submit it, because the network will ignore subsequent transactions. 
Get it?

Not no cost, just low. You still have to pay about 1 penny per 500 transactions. Thats $1 for 50,000 transactions! It's not zero!

Unfortunately, no. It only recognizes 2, Alexa, and Echo. The chip that listens is a physical Hardware chip, which wakes up the main processor when needed. The hardware chip is programmed separate from the operating system and is built to recognize a specific pattern of vowels and constants, which is why it's called "Alexa", because it has hard consonants and vowels. It's easy to differentiate. It also is unlikely to come up and speech. Google Now, for example, is triggered just a normal speech, even if it doesn't make sense in context. This is because it has no context, since it did not even process anything, it's just listening for that wore the. And then it wakes up the processor, which then decodes the rest to figure out if it should ignore or not. So it can only use context that is from the trigger word after, not before.

Yep, because frankly, there isn't a story. 
Using a private email server is nothing illegal, nothing bad, and isn't a reason to be upset. The only reason why anyone would be upset about Trump using a private email server is because people are pointing out the hypocrisy. And Marco Rubio has a private email server too, as do most employees at Big corporations.
It's mostlt far right news sites reporting about Hillary's email server. People report about it being insecure or hacked, sure. That is negligence. But having one isn't. Nobody is mad at Hillary for having a private email server, it's for being negligent and not being secure. If they set their password to one two three four, it's legal, but also negligent too. 
That's the difference. Bing Maps. Hillary has a private email server is like being mad that Hillary has a home and a car. It's to be expected...
Trump has a private email server, but frankly, I don't give a shit, because no shit he has a private email server. He probably has one for his hotel business, a personal one, and a government server as well.
Because it's not a big deal. "Hillary should have made sure to keep her email server secured and encypted, which means she is negligent and stupid." Fair enough. 
"Hillary has a private email server, which means she is hiding something or corrupt."... 
No... Just no. If you're not well versed in computers/networking, "private" email server seems fishy to the layman. 
But if I said "I have a private collection of wine" you wouldn't claim I'm hiding the fact I have wine...

Also cost 8 times as much money to run a node and 8 times as much hardware to mine, meaning that fewer larger miners will mine. AKA centralization. There is a reason BTC has 10 times the volume, and 30 times the nodes.
You realize that Lightning Network is actually similar to the "Traditional financial model" in that it is extremely fast, instant confirmation, and as efficient as a centralized payment like Paypal... but guess who controlls LN?

We both store a copy of the channel states. To close the channel or make another transaction, we must agree and mutually sign a transaction.

The blockchain.
If both people disagree on the final balance, then both submit their own version to the blockchain, but whoever has submitted the later channel state obviously isnt scamming since the person who submitted the older one is, and so the person who submitted the later one gets all the coins.

Sure, but it's not making it more efficient.
Block Increase is like increasing the range of a car by increasing the size of the fuel tank. Technically gets twice as far, at twice the fuel cost. Slightly more convenient.

Kind of. If you use a legacy client that didn't have segwit, it still works, you just pay higher fees. And it uses "proof of proof" which allows each transaction to take up less space. It also increased the maximum block size, but this extras data is not required to be saved past the last few confirmations, and can be omitted, which means while it does use more bandwidth, it doesn't increase the chain size nearly as much.

That's actually common for services like that.
Paying for me to go to the Apple store, buy something, take a video of me packing it and shipping it to you, etc. 
But again, like I said in my first post, just exchange for an Amazon gift card. That only charges 15% for the exchange. It's cheaper but doesn't give you anonymity. 
the last time I did this I actually got ripped off, about a year-and-a-half ago. It's all on right at 2, I have the post showing them asking me to send them, and then a post saying they would pay me after, and I figured because they are super active that they would follow through with their words but they didn't. 
BitPay will want your SSN and is ~10%. 
The reason why you would pay 20% is because if you wanted to buy something from Apple without giving up your social and using Bitcoin, this is the way to do it.
