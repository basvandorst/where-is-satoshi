SO TRUE! Many people in this community denounce the work of others furthering bitcoin who don't make much if any money at all. I would hate when I would write a great article, sometimes spending weeks lining up notable people in or outside the community to say something about the subject at hand only to have some trolls come in and critique everything. You think I do all that work for $50 and breadcrumb tips?

Not for sale yet but early 2016, Bitfury and kncminer will release their 16nm chips. (You can bet that they have been using them since hashrate increase 40% in last few weeks)
@_date: 2015-12-27 14:20:49


probabilistic miners?
@_date: 2015-12-25 01:05:25
they should just allow upvotes to be known... :( if the pageviews have gone down that much someone should be held accountable.
@_date: 2015-12-23 20:05:09
ummm, wtf is that left y-axis. Most bitcoin sales can be pegged to price.
@_date: 2015-12-28 01:28:40
The fact is 16nm chips are already mining, I'm not telling people to preorder them. I'm just informing them that the current hardware choices are obsolete. And bitcoin today is a lot different than bitcoin 2012. Bitfury and knc have tons of venture money. They aren't butterflop.

Maybe it actually does have to do with Greece... among other factors. 
"124 percent pick-up in inflows from Greek IP addresses"
@_date: 2015-12-24 18:18:45
that's because bitfury just unloaded the most efficient miner ever and everything else will soon be unprofitable. Difficulty increased by 40% in the last couple of months so they try to price them according to that or they would just use them. Plus the batch 9 you wont get until past Jan 20. Who knows how much the difficulty will rise by then.
@_date: 2015-12-25 01:02:34
^^^ very true, but I wouldn't invest in an S7 at the moment.

I didn't even see a ethernet cable.
@_date: 2015-06-29 14:58:16
I definitely think it will be interesting to watch. If we can confirm a bear market in China and the Greece story has enough momentum behind it to push bitcoin up just somewhat, Chinese investors might come back faster than we know it. Plus the financial markets move relatively slow in the summer. So if something happens in these next few months it will just be compounded when people get back to their trading desks. Hopefully the twins ETF will be ready by then.
@_date: 2015-12-27 18:00:19
well they are coming, and they are less than 3 months away which means these miners and the s7's bought today will never be profitable. Everyone on this thread pumping hasnt posted a comment in over a year. Tell me that doesnt smell fishy.

The Chinese culture loves risk, why would you choose to hold yuan knowing you will lose money when you can speculate and perhaps make some money. Also this only a small part of the overall population, they probably know what they are doing. A lot of them have trading bots too, they are handling a large amount of money. The whales know that others will come into bitcoin for each devaluation, hence why they just took a lot of profits off the table.

"Digital Asset Holdings is a relative newcomer to the area. It grew out of a Bitcoin trading operation created by the Chicago trading firm DRW, which operated through a little-known subsidiary of DRW known as Cumberland Mining &amp; Materials."

No, it's about individuals acting in their best interest. Decentralizing bitcoin will be great, people will set up their own "nodes" of influence and try to lobby for the best pro-bitcoin laws in their country. I think it looks bad if BF were to say this is good legislation in one country and not in this country.

I don't think you need to give each person all that money, perhaps investments in some agricultural infrastructure would go further. And as you probably know "a dollar a day can make a huge difference." Those 795 million people probably have some nourishment but only need an extra 500 calories a day. That difference could be 1 McChicken and a few mayo packets. And as you can see that number has been cut in half in the 25-year span, this is a trend that will likely continue. I'm sure it will take a blend of private/public investment, but Satoshi (if bitcoin becomes extremely valuable) would make a huge difference.

1) that seems pretty expensive for a rig.
2) storage is race to zero business (meaning storage will be free one day, we are pretty close already)
3) if storing something was really profitable in a decentralized manner there will be more storage farms, and storage pools.
4) if it was really profitable amazon and google would just put their extra capacity on the network and drive the costs down.

well if you have the land and cheap power go for it. Actual price is probably around 90+ day ROI, so I'd say it's closer to 2 million than one million.

Americans can trade on Chinese exchanges, market makers and traders just move to where the conditions are the best.

Singapore isn't listed on Coinbase's supported countries, and the article they cite on Tech in Asia has been taken down.

the trader probably didn't have enough to cover the market order, that's probably why. So, ultimately Gemini could have been on the hook and that's why the trade needed to be reversed.

ok, thank you for addressing this. I just got a response from one of the founders. I'll post it here for others:
"This is a great point, and yes, Bitcoin still has fungibility issues which need to be resolved. Our basic position is that third parties should be no more able to observe what you consume on BitTorrent than they are able to see you consume on YouTube. There are a few best pract to this at present (coinjoin, stealth addresses, no address resuse, etc.), but nothing is perfect. I suppose confidential transactions and/or lightning will increase privacy in a more robust way, but until then, we can only follow best practices and inform people about how the system works."
I also him post this on zapchain:
"We need more content on JoyStream, post a link to a torrent file you would like the community to focus on sharing (only 100% legal content), and earn bits!"

This is hilarious! Really trying to hide the volatility, if they still did a 24 hour average it would be higher. Must be 48 hours or more.

Won't bitcoin payments make it easier to track bittorrent users? I can see some privacy issues here.
@_date: 2015-03-07 21:06:29
Wait... You can use MasterCard for suspicious transactions?

Bitcoin isn't anonymous in the sense he is talking about, what he is talking about sounds more like zerocash.

I guess I have been out of the loop. How is this guy not in jail. 
"Bobby Lee, CEO of Chinese exchange BTCC, told CoinDesk his platform has seen a significant volume increase, though he dismissed much of his competitors' volume as "artificial".
Those behind the volume, he said, are not traders but consumers sucked into a Russian ponzi scheme, MMM.
"We have posted warnings on our site and on our social media to warn users to be careful, but they have been coming to our exchange and buying out like crazy," he said, adding:
"This time it's not speculative trading but based on them getting sucked into this ecosystem.""

Won't rewarding content sharers on bittorrent make it easier for government agencies to track those sharers?

Chinese exchange rate changed... that simple.

How much would you say this one site has contributed to the price? This website doesn't even have videos that are two months old on its Vimeo... ( The news has been overwhelmingly positive, VAT, other news from China, huge financial institutions and non-financial corporations partnering with bitcoin/blockchain companies...

The bitcoin community hasn't grown much in the last year, I believe we were at 140K last christmas and now we are at 176K. Uphold needs to diversify their customer base to get new users. They are onboarding new people through USD deposits that will now get introduced to bitcoin. They are doing more to grow the community than coinbase. They have always embraced 100% reserves and P2P tech. What's more bitcoin than that?
@_date: 2016-10-27 03:04:55
if there are more transactions per block that can fit in the block, it doesn't matter how high the fees are, all the transactions cant get processed. Only the highest fee ones... It will just be a race to higher and higher fees until there's no bitcoin to send and the miners have it all.

There's no arbitrage:

Yeah, I don't think OTC markets are the mainstream we are hoping for, but nonetheless it is a step forward in the right direction. I think COIN ETF will definitely be more of a market mover. Also there are a lot of companies that aren't valued close to 3-4 billion being traded but I'm guess only 1% of BTC's market cap will be traded.
