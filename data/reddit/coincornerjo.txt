I work at CoinCorner, a UK Bitcoin Exchange - I started learning about Bitcoin and the crypto industry before I joined.


I started out by doing online research. There are so many good, free resources available. [Bitcoin.org]( (not affiliated with this) is a great resource when starting out. 
Although I'm lucky to work with people in the industry, I'd suggest you speak to any friends/family/acquaintances that you know have been interested in Bitcoin for a while. Be careful about taking advice about when to buy etc though - it's always recommended that you make your own decisions based on personal circumstances (and not just because someone told you to do it).
@_date: 2019-07-04 09:16:29


This is something the company I work for, CoinCorner, is trying to improve! We're in the process of helping UK businesses to [accept Bitcoin]( 
At the moment the industry is at the beginning of using Bitcoin as a currency - it's going to take time for it to grow and develop as more people become comfortable with digital currencies.
@_date: 2019-07-23 10:57:25
If you're in the UK, it's easy to [buy Bitcoin]( as well as store and sell with CoinCorner. Our platform is very easy to use. We have plenty of FAQs which explain the buying, storing, selling process!
@_date: 2019-07-04 09:26:22
Have you managed to do this?
If you're ever looking to [buy Bitcoin]( (above 5p worth!), check us out at CoinCorner. You can still buy small amounts from us (the minimum deposit is £10). :)
@_date: 2019-07-23 09:03:56
Where are you based? If you're in the UK/Europe, you can [buy Bitcoin]( from CoinCorner.
For getting started, you're also best to do thorough personal research into Bitcoin (reading articles/books, watching videos etc) to better understand what Bitcoin is and what you would be buying. This will help you to make more informed decisions in the future.
@_date: 2019-07-23 13:21:32
If you're in the UK, one of the best ways to [buy Bitcoin]( is with CoinCorner. We're beginner friendly and our platform is very easy to use. In terms of storing, you can store with us but it's common for customers to withdraw their Bitcoin to an offline wallet of their choosing.
@_date: 2019-07-11 08:51:33
Where in Europe are you based? We may be able to help you [buy Bitcoin]( at CoinCorner!
@_date: 2019-07-23 11:23:06
You can [buy Bitcoin]( quickly and easily with CoinCorner (if you're in the UK or one of our other supported [countries](

CoinCorner is a UK Bitcoin exchange which supports customers in Austria! You might like to [buy Bitcoin]( from us. :)
@_date: 2019-07-23 10:34:09
You're best to research Bitcoin as thoroughly as possible so that you understand it and can come to your own conclusions. It's all about when is right for your personal circumstances and unfortunately no one else can help you to make that decision.
@_date: 2019-07-29 14:43:37
Yes, that's what we're aiming for!
If it looks like it will take any longer than 2 weeks, I'll let you know so that you're not waiting on it.
@_date: 2019-07-23 10:41:39
Are you in the UK? If yes, you can [buy Bitcoin]( with CoinCorner using credit card. We allow some users the opportunity to buy up to £900 before verification is required too.
@_date: 2019-07-11 10:36:02
It changes from exchange to exchange and often depends on the payment method you're using. For example, I work for CoinCorner (a [UK Bitcoin Exchange]( and our minimum deposit is £10 (or the euro equivalent) for credit/debit card.
@_date: 2019-07-11 09:18:59
Great map! CoinCorner is another exchange to add to the list. We're one of the oldest [UK Bitcoin exchanges]( (founded in 2014) -  are you happy for me to add us?
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:03:13
Yes we do, the majority of exchanges do. Our fees are displayed [here](
@_date: 2019-07-04 09:36:08






As yet it's not widely accepted, but many Bitcoin companies are working to improve this. I work for UK Bitcoin Exchange, CoinCorner, and our service helps UK businesses to [accept Bitcoin]( It's very early days for this part of the industry and we're at the point of reaching out to help businesses add Bitcoin as a payment option for their customers.
@_date: 2019-07-23 11:24:30
You can [buy Bitcoin]( using Euro with CoinCorner! We're UK based and have been in the space since 2014.

Where are you based? Let me know and I'll see if we can help you at CoinCorner!
@_date: 2019-07-04 09:37:52
It's all about deciding when is right for you and your personal circumstances! Make sure you do thorough research to feel fully up-to-date and comfortable with Bitcoin before you buy.
@_date: 2019-07-01 14:53:26


It's great to see someone helping to educate friends/family about Bitcoin but making it clear that they aren't offering investment advice! Keep up the good work educating others. :)
@_date: 2019-07-01 14:36:17
I think you have to do what feels right for you and what you can afford. Sounds like a cop out answer I know, but you want to feel comfortable with however much you decide to put in and how often you do it. 
I don't know if you've looked at places to [buy Bitcoin]( from yet, but if you're interested in an easy and quick experience, you could try us at CoinCorner. We're a UK based  exchange and support customers in more than 45 countries.

No worries, we’re here if you want to try a different exchange in the future. :)
@_date: 2019-07-23 10:48:55
You're best to start by researching Bitcoin as thoroughly as possible for yourself. Check out online articles, posts, tutorials and videos etc. The more research you can do, the more informed your decisions will be when you come to buy. Perhaps read up on Andreas Antonopoulos as he shares a lot of Bitcoin insights/knowledge and is respected in the industry.
@_date: 2019-07-11 14:39:18
You can [buy Bitcoin]( in the UK/Europe from CoinCorner. Yes, it's common practice to have to verify your identity on an exchange (it's a fraud preventing measure).

@_date: 2019-07-04 10:02:02
If you're planning to buy from an exchange, the rate refers to the price per Bitcoin. 
As with foreign exchange where the price of £ or $ differs from company to company, it's the same for Bitcoin. Exchanges set their own rates based on different factors.
@_date: 2019-07-23 10:51:48
Firstly, I'd say if you're nervous to take the first step, you should definitely take the time to do some thorough personal research into Bitcoin. The more you can learn about it, the better!
Secondly, where are you based? If you're in the UK, you might like to try [buying Bitcoin]( with CoinCorner instead. We're very beginner friendly and you can easily withdraw your Bitcoin funds from us.

Welcome to the world of Bitcoin! If you haven't researched Bitcoin much yet, I'd recommend doing thorough personal research to better understand what it is/how it works etc before you go any further. Read/learn as much as you can as it'll stand you in good stead in the future.
@_date: 2019-11-27 11:51:09


If you haven't done so already, make sure you do thorough personal research into Bitcoin before buying any. Learn what it is/how it works and this will help you when making decisions in the future.


Bitcoin can be bought online from the likes of an exchange but as others have said, the options available depend on where you live. E.g. if you're UK/Europe way, CoinCorner might be an option for you. We help people in more than 45 countries to [buy Bitcoin](
@_date: 2019-11-27 10:31:21

@_date: 2019-11-12 12:23:19
I've had mixed feedback and feel it really depends on who I'm talking to. I work in Bitcoin in the UK and in general, most of my direct family/friends are happy/interested to learn about it (I suspect as they are interested in what I'm doing too). 
When speaking with people outside my family/friends, some have been keen to ask questions about it and others have been more sceptical - by enlarge, most have already known about the price (not a surprise) and have questions about that. Important to note that I don't approach randoms and preach to them about it (not my style!) - conversations I've had about it have typically arisen through people asking what I do for work.

I work for UK Bitcoin exchange, CoinCorner, and we help UK businesses to [accept Bitcoin]( payments from customers. Generally, the main issue preventing more businesses from accepting Bitcoin is lack of awareness and/or understanding about it.

Before you do anything, take some time out to research and learn about Bitcoin (there are plenty of free online guides/resources which explain what's involved in buying Bitcoin). As you learn, you'll be able to make more informed decisions in the future.


Many Bitcoin exchanges offer mobile apps for their customers. If you're in the UK/Europe/any of our other [supported countries]( you might like to try CoinCorner. Our app is available on the [Apple Store]( 
Best of luck! :)

Nice work! I'm from a UK [Bitcoin]( exchange called CoinCorner and we're helping UK businesses to do the very same. It's great to see more businesses beginning to accept Bitcoin around the world.
Out of interest, what is the most appealing reason for accepting Bitcoin for you?
@_date: 2019-10-14 08:18:58
Inform yourself! You're best to take time to do thorough personal research before buying Bitcoin. Read articles/posts/news/books and listen to Podcasts/YouTube videos etc - just get super familiar with Bitcoin/the lingo/the industry and you'll see the benefits when you come to make decisions in the future.

Welcome! Definitely take some time to research Bitcoin/the industry as thoroughly as possible. The more you learn, the better informed you'll be in the future. I'd recommend reading articles/blogs/books and listening to Podcasts etc. "The Little Bitcoin Book" has recently been published by some people in the industry and it covers Bitcoin in a short format. It still has some complexities, but is probably a good quick-read to get started.  (FYI not affiliated with the book) :)

Welcome! First things first, do as much thorough personal research as possible before getting started in Bitcoin. The more familiar you can be with Bitcoin/the industry before buying, the better and more informed your decisions will be in the future. Research can include anything from reading articles, news, books etc to listening to Podcasts - whatever resources work best for you.


Once you've done that \^ and feel comfortable with the topic, most beginners find it easier to buy from a Bitcoin exchange (an exchange is a company which sells Bitcoin, similar to foreign exchange companies). Which exchange you choose to use will be determined by where you live. For example, if you live in the UK/Europe, you might like to try buying [Bitcoin]( from CoinCorner. We're an exchange that was founded in 2014.

Thanks for your feedback. 
I've taken a look for you as £88 doesn't sound quite right. If you deposited £100 by card, your balance with us would be £97.50 (after the 2.5% card deposit fee). When buying Bitcoin, there would be a 1% fee charged which would roughly work out at 98p on this amount. This would buy you £96.52 worth of Bitcoin.
I hope this helps.

I work for a UK Bitcoin exchange that has recently launched a new service, CoinCorner Checkout, which lets UK businesses [accept Bitcoin]( in the way you've described.
Key incentives of accepting Bitcoin include:
* **Competitive advantage** \- Offering a variety of payment methods helps businesses to reach new customer groups with an interest in Bitcoin (esp. useful for online businesses which face heavy competition).
* **PR** \- As you've noted about the recent headlines, accepting Bitcoin is a way for companies to increase public exposure and position themselves as being progressive in their respective sector.
* **Quick/inexpensive set up** \- It isn't a time-consuming and expensive addition to business operations. Accepting Bitcoin is an easy option for businesses looking to improve their customer experience.
Given that the industry is still young/growing right now, having businesses accepting Bitcoin as a payment method at all (even with cash payouts) is a hugely positive step toward increasing the use of Bitcoin as a currency. 
The dream is for businesses to accept Bitcoin payouts too, of course (something we plan to offer in the near future) - but it's one step at a time.
@_date: 2019-06-13 14:22:18
Hi [u/shanko]( 
I work for CoinCorner, a UK Bitcoin exchange, which has recently launched CoinCorner Checkout to help UK businesses [accept Bitcoin]( payments - we convert Bitcoin funds to GBP in the process you've described.


It depends on how the business is accepting Bitcoin payments. If they're using a third party service (like what my company offers), it's common for Bitcoin funds to be converted and paid out in USD / or another fiat currency. 
There are several reasons for this:
* Many businesses are concerned about Bitcoin price movements and how this would affect them. When Bitcoin is converted and paid out to the business in fiat, the price risk is removed (and handled by the third party).
* Businesses are still able to accept Bitcoin, but without having to worry about the accounting side of things for now. 
* It's still early days for businesses accepting Bitcoin as a payment method, so this solution helps to bridge the gap between the unknown (Bitcoin) and not missing out on the benefits it provides. In the long-term it should lead to businesses fully accepting Bitcoin and receiving Bitcoin payouts.
Hope this helps. :)

Hi Eric
Where are you based? If your web agency is in the UK, we can help you at CoinCorner.
As others have mentioned, it would be easier to support Bitcoin from an existing business that already has a customer base. 


Bitcoin is the most known cryptocurrency and it's of interest to people worldwide. There are also no chargebacks with Bitcoin which make it appealing to companies.


In order to accept Bitcoin you would need to work with a third-party. Our service, CoinCorner Checkout, is what's known as a Bitcoin payment gateway - it allows UK businesses to [accept Bitcoin payments](
The process of getting set up is really easy:
1. Register at the link above
2. Verify your account
3. Use one of our existing plugins to integrate the service into your website (if you have a bespoke site, we can liaise with you about integration)


In terms of our fees, there are no set up costs and we only charge a low 1% fee per purchase. Compared to the likes of PayPal (their avg. fee is 2.9%), accepting Bitcoin is considerably cheaper.
I hope this helps - feel free to ask any questions! :)
@_date: 2019-12-30 11:54:34
Fortunate that you found your keys!! Congrats on helping with your family's restaurant and mortgage too. :)
Initially I heard about Bitcoin from a friend who already worked in the industry. After a year or so, a marketing role came up at the same company in her team and I applied. I've been at CoinCorner for almost 2 years now and it's been an amazing whirlwind experience! I'm interested in how a new market becomes established and enjoy being part of the effort helping to develop Bitcoin. 
It's changed my life in the sense of giving me the chance to work at a fun, forward-thinking company and helping me to meet more like minded people in my colleagues!

Before you buy, make sure you do thorough personal research into Bitcoin/the industry so that you understand what it is/how it works etc. The more you can learn, the better!
@_date: 2019-06-17 11:10:20


I think it all has to start with people who have an interest in Bitcoin already, sharing that interest with friends/family/acquaintances - essentially spreading the word about Bitcoin. Education (encouraging people to research it for themselves) is also a huge part of this too.
Secondly, companies can help to make Bitcoin accessible to more people as well. I work for CoinCorner (a UK Bitcoin exchange) and we've recently launched a new service called CoinCorner Checkout which supports UK businesses to [accept Bitcoin]( payments. This is a positive step toward having Bitcoin being accepted in more of a mainstream way and showing that it can be used to buy daily goods/services.

Make sure you do thorough personal research to understand what Bitcoin is/ how it works etc before you get too involved. The more you can learn, the better informed your decisions will be in the future.


CoinCorner is a Bitcoin exchange that allows customers to [buy Bitcoin]( \- as little as £10/euro equivalent. We've made our service as quick/easy for beginners to use too and have been operating in the Bitcoin space since 2014. :)

Thanks for your feedback, it's really useful. I've passed the details about Sofort across to our team in case it's an option that we can consider in the future. PayPal is something we've been trying to make headway with for a while, but unfortunately they aren't open to this at the moment. We'll continue to push with them though as we recognise that it's a convenient payment method for so many people.

You can buy Bitcoin from online exchanges and withdraw your coins to an offline wallet (that you control yourself) for secure storage.  CoinCorner's a great option for buying [Bitcoin]( \- we support customers in the UK and in 45+ other countries worldwide.

Hey [u/8wardialer5](

Hey [u/jaber2](
Joanne from CoinCorner here, a UK [bitcoin]( exchange. You're totally right in saying that you see a lot of 'Buy Bitcoin' and not much 'Use Bitcoin' yet. The industry is still in what's considered to be an early stage (it's young!) which means that Bitcoin's not being bought by everyone yet and is very much developing as public interest in it grows.  
Many companies are working to help people to 'Use Bitcoin' though. For example, at CoinCorner we're launching a new service in the next few weeks which will mean that UK online stores can accept bitcoin as a payment method. This will allow people who buy and HODL to buy and spend if they want to.
It's slow and steady progress at the moment, but one day we'll definitely be seeing more 'Use Bitcoin' instead! :)

Hi u/bitcointradings
Joanne from CoinCorner here, a UK [bitcoin]( exchange. Have you done any personal research to learn about bitcoin/the market? It's best to learn as much as you can before buying so that you understand what's involved and can make an informed decision as to when is a good time to buy for you. :)

Hey [u/A5C3ND3D](
Joanne from [CoinCorner]( here - welcome to the crypto world! 
You should know that it's really important to do your own research about Bitcoin before jumping in. Friends will often give you advice (which can be useful), but there's a lot of value in figuring out what works best for you. There are plenty of good online resources - take the time to read, watch videos and learn as much as you can so that you understand what's involved.
I can't tell you when is a good time to invest, but as you research and understand more about Bitcoin, the price, etc, you'll learn when is the right time for you. It also depends on how much you're interested in buying and how much you can afford to spend (the general advice is not to spend more than you can afford to lose). 
Hope this helps you. :)
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:04:55

Hey [u/mjm1998](
Joanne from [CoinCorner]( here, welcome to the world of Bitcoin! I'll try to answer your questions below:
*Is it a good time to buy?* \- The answer to this is all down to personal research. As with buying anything financial-related, it's key that you make sure you understand what it is your buying. As you learn about Bitcoin and the industry, you'll become aware of times to buy that work for you and your plans for the purchase.
*Store it for years...* \- I know this wasn't really a question, but thought I'd quickly explain the different storage options that are available. When you buy Bitcoin you can store it online in an exchange, or offline. If you want to store it offline (also know as *cold storage*), you'll need to make sure that you buy from an exchange which lets you withdraw your Bitcoin. Many sites (e.g. Revolut and eToro) only offer *exposure* to Bitcoin - this means their customers can only buy and sell from them... they can't withdraw. 
*How much money is ideal?* \- Only you can answer this question as it really depends on how much you want to spend. (The general advice is to only spend what you can afford!)
*What website will allow you to buy bitcoin, store and withdraw it from?* \- As I mentioned above, there are some websites that do give you full access to your Bitcoin and some that don't. The exchange I work for is UK based and also supports European customers. Our customers can buy, send, sell, store, receive and transfer their Bitcoin. We offer a free online wallet for storage too, should customers want to store their Bitcoin this way.

Hey [u/gmod74]( 
Joanne from CoinCorner here - we're a UK based [Bitcoin exchange]( that supports Australia. 
As you mentioned, limits are common practice now. Usually once a new customer is verified on an exchange, their limits will be increased though - that's the process we follow. Try contacting customer support at the exchange you want to buy from as they should be able to tell you how to increase your limits too. 
Good luck. :)

Hi [u/tonydick642]( 


It largely depends on whether the merchant wants to accept crypto in-store or online, or both. For online shops, the easiest way to accept crypto is by signing up with a payment gateway provider. I work for CoinCorner (a UK Bitcoin exchange) that helps UK online shops to [accept Bitcoin payments]( via our Checkout service. 


This depends on two factors: what the payment gateway provider supports and what the merchant's research tells them. For example, at CoinCorner we only support Bitcoin. It's important for the merchant to do their own research into BTC/BCH and come to a conclusion themselves about which crypto would be better for their business.


This is key of course and any payment gateway provider worth their salt will make the whole process as easy as possible for the merchant to accept Bitcoin. 
I hope this helps and best of luck to your local merchant should they decide to move forward with accepting crypto. :)

There are a few companies that offer what's known as *exposure* to Bitcoin - as you've explained, you can only buy and sell it. In future you want to look for a place that lets you send and receive too.
