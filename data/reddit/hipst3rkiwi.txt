I mean one can already send bitcoins to others via a tip bot so idk why it's a problem to add it to a messaging app

@_date: 2014-12-30 03:40:48
Oh... Now I feel stupid
@_date: 2014-12-30 05:13:46
I was thinking the same thing... If they accepted bitcoins then they would expand their sources of donations

No. See FireChat has a temporary mesh network, but as soon as you connect to wifi it uploads all of your message and syncs them across your devices. So you could pay without wifi but the transaction would have to happen after you connect to wifi

I guess you could but I'm sure it is possible to get around it somehow
@_date: 2014-12-30 05:12:11
Oh... That's sad to hear
@_date: 2014-12-31 00:28:18
Theres Massachusetts aaaaaaaand, then theres Utah
@_date: 2014-12-31 03:49:16
How cool would it be if FireChat add a feature to transfer Bitcoins
@_date: 2015-01-17 05:04:52
Oh but couldn't you make something that connects via blue tooth or is that not secure enough?
@_date: 2015-01-11 06:42:17
Aww does the changetip bouton longer concert the bitcoins to USD in its posts anymore?
@_date: 2015-01-01 16:57:25
I feel as if the  is a better plan than this
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:11:02
