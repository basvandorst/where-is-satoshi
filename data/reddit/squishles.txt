You need a next amazon not a next paypal. The bitcoin itself obsoletes paypal.

credit cards could be implemented without tracking too, but it was a consequence of early tech, and authorities found out it was there, they don't want to let it go now.

I'm a drug dealer being arrested; all of my assets are being seized, oopsy where're my bitcoins officer :)
This of course applies to assets being seized for any reason, maybe you government just woke up on the wrong side of the bed that day. There is also a lot of tracking on cash, if you work in large quantities, odds are you are being investigated.

can't do that one cash/cryptocurrencies :)
also every transaction is a relationship the gov would love to track.

i had a wallet from when they where less than a dollar, I should have kept is somewhere safer.

Which is kind of code for we don't want to back that it's secure or there is a master key =/

Who's going to whistle blow, these are complex chips you can't exactly spot something at a glance; it's not exactly human readable code. And you can add the back door as a post step to any work on the design done by any engineers not in on it.

I'd have to agree, everyone's known about this for years. The only other story to it would be if someone's spotted nefariouse useage. Anything else is definitely fud.

As per the article, they are apparently scrounging safe deposit boxes, for what's probably essentially peoples coin collections. That's something that would normally be written off as crazy. Not too much farther to jump; If I were a greek, I'd be freaking out.
More a thought exercise anyway.

It's with the assumption they already have the bank, that's 2 keys. :(
I'd think 4 key 2 required for quorum would be best, then you hold two and if you fuck up and lose them you go to your bank/eskrow, eskrow and bank having zero knowledge of each other. This way you don't need their cooperation to withdraw, and that buys you a few days to yank your coins out if they go bananas. (ok if they're serious maybe hours, cartesian product wouldn't take long)

The two/three key one, a gov losing it's shit can still force the escrow to help bounce it out to another wallet. Although it buys you time matching up the escrow if escrow doesn't know the matching account/bank (but not perfect, you could simply collect the two sets of keys and run a one to one Cartesian product). It'd be nice to keep a spare 4th in the basement lockbox or whatever.
Hardware wallet I wouldn't run a backdoor past hypothetical crazy gov, but that would take effort and time; a fair amount safer.
The other thing I'd be worried about mildly is a country with nation scale firewall capability like say China simply blocking block chain traffic. But that couldn't stop access if you fled(which you should at that point).
I agree this is orders of magnitude safer than current currency where they just have to say the word and it's locked. And this all requires btc being more on the radar, and a whole other level of gov dun lost it's shit before it becomes a problem.

It's not really a security method in and of itself. Although yes that is why encryption is hard to break on a smaller simpler scale. A two bank combo could load up on a fuckton of fake accounts though, and make it into one :P
Most encryption basically works off this being hard. You have two lists like that example except the lists are every prime number, up to some bit limit. And in order to break it, you have to go through checking every combination, which can take a long time. Nevermind what a pain in the ass it is to even generate a list of prime numbers of sufficient size to check with quickly. But if you already know the keys it's fast.

This whole time I assumed we were using bank+eskrow as backup in case all keys you hold are lost or destroyed, I think we've been imagining entirely different uses for a bitcoin bank XD Used to have a wallet of 100 someodd coins when it just started out, lost in a harddrive reformat because at the time that wasn't stupid valuable(like a couple bucks worth maybe) and I forgot; so backup seemed like a plausible use for a bitcoin bank to me :p
say you have a list of keys and another list, they have matches but you don't know which to which
you loop through each key in one list testing it against every key in the other list.
It would take a nasty amount of time, but there's a finite test for if the key's match in this case we can call isWallet()
    for(key i in keylist1){
        for(key x in keylist2){
            if(isWallet(i,x)){
                yay money
            }
        }
    }
It's an O(n^2) operation, which means it takes a fucking long time if you have two sets with no mapping to match them up, and a lot of items to check. Of course could be seconds if you're working with small lists.
[And also the leading cause of me wanting to track down whoever was the DBA who fucked that up 10 years ago on this large piece of business software I've been updating; so I can crack their skull in with a bat. Which is why cartesian products have been on my mind a lot lately. :( ]

In the case of greece, being unable to withdraw your money or move it to where you can withdraw it is effectivly losing your fiat.
same thing could happen if access to your btc where through a bank though =/

When you have 100k to invest volatility is unacceptable. When you have 1k your more inclined to spin the roulette wheel.

Why would that be capitalized? It's a borrowed computer science term, it's an adjective. You would describe a transaction as atomic.

ehh shows there's still work to be done on this idea though; overall the whole concept seems much much more elegant than pieces of paper tied to nations, who are prone to shit fits.

More government acknowledgement of btc as a valid currency, and a reaction of fear to that.
Although what did worry me is if there is a finite number of btc's what happens to seized/lost wallets just forever dead btc's? I had a wallet when if first started with 1 btc in it no idea what happened to it is that btc just gone forever now irrevocably forgotten by all?

ehhh steady infinite deflation, gets weird on the 1000's of years scale.
