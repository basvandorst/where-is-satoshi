I understand but when these dips occured nobody at my work or around me in general was talking about it now, now everyones is a have a go trader since it hit 10k so it feels different.
I will buy back in but i'm going to wait and see.

Just dipped its toes below 10k and it held!
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:17:17
Hard to say but I have bought back in again.

I had a bad feeling yesterday and sold my btc after getting in at 2800 and 4600, then this happens.. now I im scared to buy back in because it keeps going down.

Guess I'll spectate for a while and see what happens, I think if it breaks into below 10k that's when we'll see the serious drops.

Well I was nervous and did a test transfer out of coinbase that took about 3 days, now I'm doing a bigger transfer and waiting on that. Leaving pretty much my original investment to reinvest on the exchange when I see a good opportunity.
I can let you know how long the large transfer takes if you like, and pm me if you want the amount.

Maybe, I'm still going to see where it goes before reinvesting.. I think we might see a painfully low figure before it really starts to recover so im not re-investing yet.

Yeah, i think we need to wait to see if 10k holds, but watching gdax I don't think it will. If it doesn't hold then I predict a bit of a free fall.. when to buy back in is hard to say as you see up spikes along the way where people are trying to guess the bottom.

Nevermind still  only 11,2 this morning, which isnt exactly mooning. I try not to make money day trading as that can end badly.

I got schooled in this day one, bought the 2800 high back in June when a big dip came in eventually resulting in 1500 low. My friend convinced me not to sell and just buy more when it bottoms out. Glad I listened.

2800 checking in, wish I'd bought more
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:59:06
Question, on coinbase does it make a difference how much you buy due to fees?
ie: does buying smaller quantities work out more expensive
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:56:08
Im glad I panic sold at 14.3k tbh even though at the time I thought I'd regret it
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:50:08
I bought when it dropped to 3k but only like £250 worth :|

From what I'm gathering being new to this, when others are selling and the value drops that's when you buy more btc rather than offload.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:22:01
I bought in at 2800 the other day, the risk is if you sell it could bounce back up and you'll end up spending more to get back to where you were.
@_date: 2017-06-16 18:34:24
I'd like to know too
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:52:59
Tell me about it, I bought in pretty high recently currently sitting at a small loss and trying to get a grip on how this all works and if it's likely to hold its value.
