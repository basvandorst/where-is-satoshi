I'm originally from Cleveland so I'll give you a bit of insight of the area. Basically close to these businesses is University Circle and Coventry. It's very trendy and very much a younger crowd that is pretty well understanding of technology.
On top of the it probably helps John Carroll University is basically right there as well. If you're not familiar with John Carroll it's, if I'm not mistaken, considered one of the best smaller universities in the country. It's a very prestigious school and a lot of very smart individuals that go there.
I think this was a very well thought out and logical location to try to bring bitcoin into it. I'd be curious to see what kind of response they get in a year.
I know people like to bash Cleveland and Ohio. But like all places there's good and bad to it. Cleveland Heights/University Heights/Shaker Heights is one of the best neighborhoods to experience in Cleveland. Just make sure you don't end up making a wrong turn, the ghetto is basically on the next street over.
Also forgot to mention the Cleveland Clinic is right there as well... It always amazed me how much money is in that area when it's surrounded by slum. Anyway if you ever get over there check it out. It's very nice.

My wife, originally from Miami, just took a weekend trip up there and loved it. Once my daughter finishes high school we plan on moving back to Cleveland from Florida. 4 more years. :P But congrats on what you guys have going on. Gotta get into Ohio City now!
