It's only "mostly dead." If it goes under $500 I'm buying. If it goes under $400 I'm buying ALOT. Ditto the Warren Buffet quote down there...

Nope. I just know that they try 10 things, and 9 of them fizzle. The Kindle is their 1 thing that hasn't, yet. The kindle competes, but doesn't really outshine. Amazon doesn't have the software hubris to compete with Apple. It's a forked android tablet that's locked into the Amazon app store, which isn't nowhere near as robust as Apple's. In addition, Android apps don't work with Kindle. Google is pissed at Amazon for doing this, so no more Android support. So long story short, Amazon's competing directly with Apple, and burned their bridge with Google. All that just to do it "their way." The Kindle will eventually get buried. 
Amazon is an innovative company, but companies that think they can replicate other innovations "just because they're a big successful company" are simply deluding themselves. Amazon is better off working on their sales and delivery (which is how they started), rather than trying to tackle something that they are uneducated about.

Get lawyered up. Contact the police and file report that the principal stole your property. BTC is property, and you can't really gamble with a paper wallet, unless you threw it into the pot of a poker game.

I think miners should be treated as volunteers. They are volunteering their efforts, hardware, electricity to support the network. Networks are non-profits (from what I can tell). Coin should not be taxed until it reaches exchanges or sold. If you're constantly selling coin, then you should be taxed. If you're mining and keeping, no taxes should be paid.

LOL… Amazon also thinks they're going to replace Fedex, UPS, and the USPS with drones. I think Bezos thinks Amazon can simply make everything in-house and not cooperate with others. Their payment system will be like their Kindle. Nobody really uses it because it's just a second-rate knock-off.

The IRS doesn't care about your unpaid $30 capital gains tax. The IRS had to swing in the dark to put something out there for the new exchanges that will handle hundreds of millions of dollars in bit coin trading in a few months.

Not true… I just spent some of my precious BTC. On an ASIC, but, I still spent it.

Is there any way to ammend the tax code for digital currencies? Maybe set thresholds for capital gains for digital currencies? I think the tracking of BTC with small, and short-term purchases is stupid. I think if Washington was smart, they'd have a big sit-down between Fincen, the IRS, reps from the BTC industry to hash out some decent rules. We need our top officials to realize (for once) that this might make us financial leaders once again.

Philly is stupid. I should know. I grew up in Philly.

I totally agree with this article. I was trying to make a very similar case in my thread in r/dogemining. Mining SHOULD NOT be taxed. Only the sale is realization, and then it should be taxed.

Read my post below. The Kindle is simply a media trap for Amazon's app store.

Very good news! Yellen made a very smart statement today, proving that Senator Manchin is a dolt. Very accurate response to say that "Bitcoin doesn't touch banks." That's because bitcoin goes around banks. It's a means of transferring wealth outside of the banks. We'll see what FinCen says now... I think we're going to be free-and-clear pretty soon. Mt. Gox is dead, and opposition is shrinking.

I thought of this recently. Everyone compares BTC to an ounce of gold. But, there's only going to be 21,000,000 coins eventually mined. There are only 170,000 tons of gold in the world, and a gold bar is around 438 ounces. That means that there are 5,467,470,000 ounces of gold in the world. If you equate that to bars of gold, there are only 12,482,808 bars of gold. If you equate the 12,000,000 BTC currently mined, you might be holding a gold bar, and not an ounce of gold.

BTC is being pushed down by investors. I see the market pushing down BTC to as low as it can go $250+. Then Wall street will start buying up in the summer when nobody is looking. Price will be up towards 2-3k by the winter. They'll make a killing with 10x gains. Just hold onto your BTC and ride the wave. If it gets down to $200, I'm definitely buying more.

I think you're missing a big point. People want to get away from the credit cards, banks, and paypal taking your money and using it to make gobs of money for themselves. This is about circumventing the system, and allowing people store and transfer wealth without having it touch the current financial system. Wouldn't it be great for you to get direct deposit to your address? It'd be nice to be able to pay your mortgage without writing a check or doing a bank transfer? Wouldn't it be nice to go shopping at the mall without exposing yourself with CC swipes? This is about going around the system to empower people.

I agree with this.. I feel that miners shouldn't pay taxes on mined coins. If the coins aren't sold, or transferred for goods, then we shouldn't have to pay taxes on it. If I make something and don't sell it, then how is the value realized?? How do you have a business where you don't sell your product? I think the IRS should change this before it gets out of hand. Only until you sell the coins should you declare it as income, and pay capital gains. Capital gains function to tax the purchase and sale of existing stock, or property. How can they tax something that is created, and has never been sold? There's a problems with capital gains. We should be petitioning the IRS to rethink this.

That's a good question. I'm thinking about doing that as well.
Edit: I was wondering if it'd be smart to sell to instant wallet and just buy ethereum...
