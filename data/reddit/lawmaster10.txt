So now we are posting delusional theories from a Twitter account that has 17 followers?
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:08:04
Hahaha so now you are not agreeing with data? Send me your data then. This is daily volatility measured as absolute value of log of returns. It shows exactly how much does a price fluctuate day to day. You can check the data yourself
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:49:05
True, good point. I guess it fits some peoples' agenda
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:25:00
Agreed. But there is no doubt that it should be on the sidebar
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:56:31
More people need to realize that this is not a good thing. 
Andreas M. Antonopoulos‏ [tweeted this in 2015](
"Volatility is good for traders and bad for the overall industry. I'm more concerned about the long term health of the industry" 
This should be a wake up call to this sub. Stop celebrating these sharp price increases and stop focusing on price so much. Volatility is bad for Bitcoin, either way you look at it.
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:59:43
What kind of agenda? Read the article that I posted and please let me know: 
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:40:59
My conclusion being what? That volatility drastically increased throughout 2017? That's supported by data
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:50:23
That is all correct. But when Bitcoin is still not mature enough that it can drop by more than 30% in one day, no merchants will ever accept it. And because it's so speculative, it cannot currenlty be used as a medium of exchange
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:15:03
Jesus... You didn't even source or anything man. I am showing a yearly trend of volatility this year that is indisputable. I am not saying that it didn't drop at a certain point in time. I am just looking at a yearly trend
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:19:11
In my opinion, this is a troubling and unacceptable view from a moderator of r/bitcoin. As u/ThrowingAwayTheLice mentioned, r/GirlsGoneBitcoin is linked on the sidebar but whitepaper isn't? Seriously?
It's clear that u/theymos has an agenda that is affecting the newcomers and it needs to be changed. Any crypto enthusiast should agree that this kind of behavior has no place in this community and we should voice our concerns. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:55:09
No point, he doesn't have any. But like it goes, I will get downvoted anyways because only good news for Bitcoin are upvoted here. The confirmation bias in this place is unreal
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:13:34
Your example is not really accurate. The whitepaper has been released 10 years ago and even though the space has evolved, it should still be the first thing that everyone getting into crypto reads or just skims through. 
But not linking it in the sidebar will just look like manipulation. Put it there and let people make their own conclusions.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:47:57
I can’t take criticism if you don’t back it up. My data and analysis is correct and you can check it yourself. You are welcome to call me out if I am wrong. You are still confusing a short term decrease in volatility with a year long trend, which is what I am showing.
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:01:01
That gives him a right to remove the whitepaper from the sidebar? Why not late people read it let them make their own conclusions instead of manipulation 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:50:53
But this subreddit will call out anyone who doesn't fit in their views a shill. It used to be a sub with technical discussions and not meme circle jerks celebrating speculative price increases. Oh well, if it is not addressed quickly, the market will speak.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:37:44
Yes I am aware of that. The problem is that if the U.S. government starts regulating these hubs, they will be forced out of the U.S. They will function in Namibia or on the Bahamas like you say yourself. But then the merchants in the U.S. will just stop using LN in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:32:08
Coming from a redditor for 1 week. I am not advocating for BCH, I like all coins that try to solve the speed and fees. Whether it be BCH, ETH, Dash or LTC. I honestly don't care but I am frustrated that the Bitcoin devs are refusing to acknowledge that this is becoming a big issue that will threaten BTC. Steam stopped accepting BTC payments, BitPay is implementing BCH. I remember a time when this subreddit celebrated when new merchants started accepting BTC. Or when BTC was a cryptocurrency for the unbanked from developing countries. Now, BTC is celebrated to act as a savings account and a store of value? Seriously?
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:03:46
It's still capital gains but no one will find out
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:43:44
You forgot to add the more important point. Especially the Bitcoin subreddit is a FOMO machine, which is potentially even more dangerous than FUD to newcomers.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:17:33
Soon? Soon when? The value of BTC is seriously threatened by competition now more than ever. LN will need to be tested very thoroughly, which can take even more than a year from now. And if you read the LN whitepaper, they say themselves that blocksize increase is necessary for it to work properly. So why wait now? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:20:06
What about the fact that you need to technically preload your LN channel with BTC? It will tend to create large LN hubs as opposed to peer to peer trasnfers
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:40:25
What are you talking about? I am not blocked and neither is this copy pasta. Must feel bad to be downvoted for trolling in your own subreddit
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:00:45
That would be ok. But aren't you worried that large nodes will lead to centralization? What if these nodes are run by the conventional financial institutions? What if the largest hubs start requiring KYC/AML compliance?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:48:08
Yep. The 230k of unconfirmed tx's is becoming a panic selling protection
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:29:06
I agree that it is not a long term solution but a short term solution is really necessary now. Segwit adoption is low and if this is not fixed, the panic will cause a lot of people to sell off. It's clear that LN will need larger blocks than 1MB
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:04:03
And don't you think that the government will try to regulate centralized hubs that are run by businesses? If they process large amounts of money, they will surely be required to comply with AML/KYC. Something that's currently not possible with the decentralized transfers
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:02:03
Ok, thanks. I have one follow-up question. Do you think that if a coalition with over 51% actually formed, could they theoretically manipulate the Bitcoin supply similarly to central banks?
@_date: 2017-02-05 02:57:36
Would you mind pointing me to the data that you are talking about? Thank you so much!
@_date: 2017-02-05 02:29:40
I'm not lying. However, there are some articles, which confuse me. Such as 
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:03:13
Satoshi said many things and people like you are picking and choosing his quotes to fit their agenda. He's becoming the modern bible...
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:38:02
You are right, just checked. Thank you a lot for pointing it out. Just changed it on the site
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:14:47
You are right, I was not aware of this card. But the fact remains that there is no card that can be issued globally right now. Certainly not to Philippines 
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:39:36
There are a lot of Bitcoin debit cards. But some work just as a top up. So you send bitcoin there and it converts it to fiat on the card, which you can then use. Shift and Xapo only hold bitcoins in your wallet and sell the required amount after you make a purchase. So you don't need to keep topping up. You just keep your bitcoin balance and pay with that. I am looking for other cards that work that way.
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:04:28
Which one? All the debit cards that were issued to outside Europe were cancelled if you didn't prove that your residence is still in Europe.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:16:07
I am aware, thanks :)
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:07:22
Anecdotal evidence. Look at averages to get a better idea
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:57:39
Exposure to more people? Not everyone is technically literate to safely handle their own wallets and private keys. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:18:12
And if you don't mind telling me, which moderator can I contact with this matter? How can I know which one deleted it?
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:58:38
There are no Bitcoin debit cards that can be issued to outside of Europe. This is because of the WaveCrest monopoly on issuing such debit cards and they recently changed their policy. The only exception right now is WageCan Golden Card, which costs $162.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:10:34
It is an interesting approach though. It's probable that after they adopt it as a legal tender, they will attempt to ban other cryptocurrencies in Russia.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:37:48
I agree to a certain extent and everything that you are saying is already included in the article.
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:48:31
I tried and did not find anything. These resources are not easily accessible. But thank you for being so condescending!

@_date: 2017-11-19 17:00:17
I am aware but more people need to see this. If it results in a deletion of my profile then so be it
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:52:37
You know what I meant ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:44:48
Can you explain why did the post get removed then? What rules did it break?
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:33:52
Thanks for comments :) But to best of my knowledge, they are running - 
I will look into DCG. Do you have any reliable source?
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:08:55
"CoinJar Swipe is for use in Australia exclusively"
There are some exceptions but on a global scale, there is no debit card that ships worldwide other than WageCan Golden Card. Moreover, CoinJar Swipe doesn't support spot rate conversion so you have to top up and convert to Australian dollars, correct?

But deleting upvoted posts because it doesn't fit an agenda is ok to you?
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:32:02
Yes, Shift does and Xapo also works that way. But not sure about all the others.
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:49:31
Just like Coinbase. But better than nothing for sure :)

Bitcoin currently does not satisfy the criteria of being a currency because it does not act as an effective medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value. Bitcoin presently acts as a scarce digital commodity with a finite supply. The finite supply and deflationary pressures make Bitcoin  highly speculative. Bitcoin's value lies in its network effect and a first mover advantage, which makes it vulnerable to a potentially superior cryptocurrency such as Ethereum. The biggest obstacle preventing Bitcoin from becoming an alternative to other fiat currencies is its volatility. Bitcoin's volatility is far larger than even smaller fiat currencies. 
In the past two years, Bitcoin has been the most traded in China by far. Historically, China is followed by the United States and then European Union and Japan. Therefore, it is fair to assume that China is the most significant external factor that will influence Bitcoin's volatility, followed by the United States, the European Union and then Japan. The macroeconomic explanatory variables of China, U.S. and European Union are all significant to forecast next day's volatility of Bitcoin, which indicates that Bitcoin is starting to react to the same variables as the fiat currencies in these countries. Japan's macroeconomic variables are not significant, however. 
Bitcoin's volatility is the most sensitive to the price changes in CNY, which further points to the centralization of Bitcoin. Currently, macroeconomic shocks from China, the U.S. and the EU affect Bitcoin disproportionately more than shocks from other countries. In order for Bitcoin to truly become an international alternative to fiat currencies, it must become more independent of the larger countries. 
However, the volatility levels have historically been trending downward and if Bitcoin were to follow the same trend as in the last six years, it will reach the volatility levels of fiat currencies approximately in 2019-2020. If Bitcoin ever reaches the volatility levels of fiat currencies, its value is going to increase greatly because it will satisfy the criteria of being a functioning currency and therefore will be ready for a mass adoption.

Thank you for your comments!
All of the conclusions were made based on the analysis of all the daily observations from August 18, 2010 to March 17, 2017. In this period, China was indeed the most significant external factor that influenced Bitcoin's volatility and Bitcoin's volatility was the most sensitive to the price changes in CNY- you can see the results if you are curious. 
@_date: 2017-04-11 02:36:47
Thank you for your comments. They helped me improve the content a lot :) 
I was not saying that Bitcoin's value is in volatility. I am saying that Bitcoin's value is in its first mover advantage, network effect, anonymity and decentralization. What I am saying, however, is that when the volatility levels reach the levels of fiat currencies, Bitcoin will become more functional as an alternative to other currencies. Merchants won't have to convert their bitcoins right away to fiat and speculation motive will fade with time.
