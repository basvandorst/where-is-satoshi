ETH is solid. But I wouldn’t get in at this price. It’s too far from its 50 day MA - and I usually use that a basis for the price that I’m getting in at. BTC seems to have found support at its 50 day which I take as a positive indicator - it’s tested that price point on several counts over the last month and has found support. Just don’t buy any currency when it’s trading close to its ATH - the aim is to buy currencies when they aren’t as much in focus - when the herd is focused elsewhere.

Just finished doing that earlier today. ETH should see a correction soon IMO - don’t know at what point but surely around the corner. Likewise, BTC should see a nice pump. Alts have been dominating for a while now and eating into market share - time for the OG to win back some of the market share with a price rise.

BTC has been holding its ground, which is a big indicator of strength and investor confidence. Alts have been getting squelched, but BTCs correction has been relatively tempered. I sold all my ETH yesterday and switched to BTC - honestly, I don’t know about the long term, but for now it is going to rally and gain back some of its lost market share. 
I do however love some of the projects out there - namely OMG - it solves a real world problem and is backed by a phenomenal team, hence absolutely worth going long on. 
Very honestly, at the end of the day, no one truly understands what’s going on with this market - it’s complex beyond imagination. The best we can do is do our research and go long on projects that we truly believe in.

Be patient and sit tight, Whether BTC is here to stay or not, it will have its run and you will most definitely hit that 19k mark again.
