Dario, any update on the current issues? Thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:27:49
Same for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:48:03
As a mirror? :-)

Bitcoin is already confusing enough for the masses. I fear calling it by “Satoshi” is just going to add to that confusion.

It’s probably more that despite the fact there there are daily price discussion threads people still post new ones. If we could predict the future we would all be bitcoin millionaires. :-)

US tax laws make it difficult to use as a currency at the moment.

Try a Reddit search for "eli5 segwit" :)

If they are sold then someone still owns them. Does that really fix anything? 
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:27:11
My understanding is they auctioned off or plan to auction off the bitcoin they seized. At least a documentary I watched suggested that.

I think you would only be entitled to your initial investment of $1000 if I am understanding your concern correctly.

I've been keeping mine in there. Feel like the chances of me messing something up or losing them is greater than coinbase. At least that's how I look at it. That said I only have about $6k in there. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:16:18
Awesome. Thank you! Love the app!!
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:17:08
0 or 1 is my guess. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:47:59
You misspelled "misspelling" �� 
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:09:01
Just bought another at 3800 so...
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:58:24
Glad I could help! ��
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:42:15
Could make taxes more difficult. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:54:26
Somewhere between 0 and 3700
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:59:07
This is like your 9th new thread on this thing. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:35:27
The price is the price at the time you commit to buy it not when it completes. The .2 is probably rounding. The larger amount is probably because you used a referral link and got $10 free for using that link. Just a guess. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:01:44
You are spamming the subreddit. Why not just use a single thread? 
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:58:28
The tax implications, at the moment in the US, make it somewhat difficult to spend BTC. Hopefully with the new proposed legislation to not tax transactions less than $600 that will become easier.  
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:07:08
I've read these posts as well. I will say from personal experience, from just a month of use, that I have not had any trouble with coinbase across about a dozen transactions. That said I've only purchased. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:48:49
Yes, unfortunately. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:00:49
There are some pretty frightening stories of people getting their coins stolen off exchanges. Lots of potential weaknesses that go beyond just you. You have to trust that social engineering against someone you don’t even know isn’t used to gain access to your account. 
I initially thought the same. Reading this forum and some of the stories quickly made me paranoid about my internet security in general and my bitcoin in particular. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:56:44
Sorry didn’t see the second question. Yes to the first. Probably not to the second. Not sure though. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:34:47
I'm in at similar numbers and frankly I would love for it to drop to $1000. I would just double down at that numbers and buy tons more.
