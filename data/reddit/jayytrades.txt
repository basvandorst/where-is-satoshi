Ahh so you mean you know nothing about trading. Got it. You fit the stereotypical reddit wanna be day trader perfectly. Good day sir.

You are correct. Fibonacci is based on supply &amp; dement.

Well I trade market structure. So support/resistance levels and swing highs/lows are most important to me. Second is investor sentiment. Price moves in patterns. You break a resistance/swing high, price usually will come back to retest before continuing higher. So the last swing high was around $9,000.
 So  we have to see if price will retest it and head higher. If that level doesn't hold, then it'll likely fall to the next zone. But if it does hold then we will likely see a big push to the upside.  
Plus Majority of the big traders I know all wanna see price pull back to around and then they will be buying around $8,000. 
So my sentiment is that there is a lot of liquidity sitting between $8000 - $9000 so if we push down there, enough orders will be activated and we will start to push higher.
Of course this is just my opinion and pure speculation, but this is how I feel about it.

Do you even know what these "lines" are ?

I think you're misinterpreting how Fibonacci works. Fibs account for the emotion is and likely action of traders. Fibs don't control bulls and whales. Bulls and whales control Fibonacci. It's just an algorithm

Then I'll reassess. Ideally I'd like it to come down to around $8,000

You're not very bright. Trading is all speculation. If I'm wrong, which I very well may be, but if I am, then I'll simply reassess the new setup and determine what I think is next.

now i think we may get another push down. after looking at the daily closely
@_date: 2019-07-14 13:36:21
It's gotta gather liquidity and retail investor confidence to make another bull run and I think we will soon see that once it pulls back a little more

Well I hope he doesn't get discouraged over the next few weeks because we're gonna see it push lower before finally rising

If you really think my chart is "Gibberish" you literally know nothing about day trading. At least not trading done right. I'm sure you can't even identify or explain anything on my chart. Yet it's Gibberish. Makes sense.

My "tooth fairy" analysis is accurate around 80% of the time tho.... This ain't a game. I really do this. 
I'm sorry you 2 are complete novices that don't know the first thing about day trading. If you don't recognize what's drawn on my chart and what it all means and how it works, you may want to go back to baby pips.

Garage charts? Y'all are a bunch of jerks. I see why nobody likes this thread
@_date: 2019-07-17 19:01:38
it may or may not drop big time again. its retesting previous swing lows right now. i wanna see it break this smaller trend line ive drawn on my chart and form a continuation pattern. if it does, i will take a buy position
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:35:21
I feel sorry for people like you

I highly doubt we're ever going to see it reach that low to the $3,000 range again. I personally believe that $8,000 will be the next floor area where lots of liquidity will be gathered and price will start to push up. That's just my assumption and what I'm hoping for. I'm waiting for the daily close today and probably tomorrow.. if we get any reversal signs, I'm going to start taking positions
@_date: 2019-07-17 14:23:52
IMO the most ideal price would be around $7500 but I doubt we'll get that low. So around $8000 - $8500 if we get that low. If we touch $9,000 I'm jumping in
