I can't say I was around (consciously) in the 80s so shame on me. However, I do distinctly remember that, whereas I had been using computers since 1990, it wasn't until the playstation and cd burners came out, that pirating seemed to explode. I remember all of a sudden seeing street hustlers popping stands to sell pirated PS games, software as well as high quality music and movies (since previously bootlegging went through VHS and cassette tapes). I don't doubt that 0s and 1s have been duplicated since the birth of computers, my claim is that it became very widespread in society in the mid-90s. Am I wrong?

One of the arguments made is that crypto communities will lose portions of the community at each hard fork. This immediately begs the question: Is it possible to perform a hard fork that incentivizes abandonment of the 'classic' chain? 
Clearly, as long as anyone is willing to mine/trade on the classic chain, it will continue to survive (ETC case in point). But what if the developers program the hard fork in such a way that the secret emergency communication keys for the classic chain are released publicly upon performing the fork?
This would allow anyone to DDOS the chain with fake emergency messages implicitly screwing the credibility of the classic chain.

In 1996, pirating software was avantgarde for its time. Lets remember that this was barely two years after the release of the first Playstation which ushered the era of burning shit on CDs at home. The fact that Mr. Devasini was fined in 1996 leads me to believe that this man had been burning &amp; selling pirated content for a while. Also, 100 million lira back then was roughly $50k.

Quick question. I am a dual citizen and often buy/sell btc in both continents. The vast majority of the time I do so for remittance purposes to move money between European and US accounts. In these circumstances the price doesn't fluctuate between transfers (30 mins is the typical execution time). 
My first two questions are:
Can I argue this as being a neglectable taxable event?
Is it even a taxable event if I, say, but btc with euros and sell them for usd?  
In the future I may want to sell some of my cold storage coins. I was wondering if the following procedure would limit my tax liabilities as a US citizen. 
Since most of my coins are bought in euros, can I sell them for euros (non-taxable event) and then immediately buy them back to transfer/sell them for USD as a normal remittance this creating a "neglectable" taxable event? 
Thanks for your help to the community!

I don't think blacklisting is as easy as you're making it. 
Either you blacklist the IPs of the individual miners which a government could easily sidestep OR you blacklist their additions to the blockchain by literally pruning it to its last "known" stable state. If the attack were to be replayed over and over again, this would literally halt and and all mining progress on the blockchain! 
@_date: 2015-12-12 11:59:16
The response on behalf of the network would have to happen in a very short time span. If a malevolent attacker were to quadruple the network hashrate all of a sudden, the difficulty would adjust within 3 days! 
what happens if they then suddenly pull their hashrate off the network? It would take the test of the network a month and a half just to mine enough blocks to trigger the next difficulty adjustment. Many miners might have gone offline by then. Furthermore, the utility of the network would become nearly useless during that time as blocks would fill up beyond proportion,  the mempool will explode and transactions taking forever to confirm even once. 
What if simultaneously a country like the US releases its own protocol for a dollar denominated crypto currency incentivizing miners to mine it instead? 
This would justify the billions spent in attacking the bitcoin network as all their state-controlled miners would simply be redirected to mining UScoin afterward anyways.

Of course independence is key! But we must be realistic that this is a tug-of-war between reality and idealism. Where, as time goes by, the ideas sculpt reality and reality grounds the ideas. As much as one is to hope that miners would be consistent in the face of such a crisis, it can't be taken for granted. 
Also, when you say "download and install new version", what you are talking about is a hard fork. I truly hope that our governance model gets to a point where we can launch hardforks at our whims but it certainly isn't the case now. 
We can have lead developers (Gavin, van der Laan and Theymos? I think are the ones that have keys to do this) send a network  emergency alert to get everyone to update core... True... But what if the attacker suddenly puts his miners back online from new IPs. And then turns them off again. And on once more? Are we really gonna have people launch hard forks multiple times over the course of days? 
It seems to me that our best bet is to let the network grow so large that even the US could mobilize enough resources to deprecate it. This would imply that the ideas have won by remolding our world  for the better. Financially speaking.

I agree with a statistical dynamic scaling approach. As right as Greg is on reminding people about the importance of the tx fee market, simply keeping the blocksize as is puts too much power in the miners hands. 
If miners were, for example, to spam the system (similarly to the stress test done last week) in order to incentivize users to pay higher fees to have their transactions processed in a timely manner, there should be a counter process which makes it more expensive for this strategy to proceed. That process is precisely the dynamic increasing of the blocksize.
The reality is that we are still hooked to the block reward kind of like global finance has been to quantitative easing the past years. Ultimately, like Gavin (and many others) hopes, only a substantial increase in bitcoin value can make the fees pay for the system. Larger blocks can in principle lead to a larger accumulation of fees per block but it would also centralize the network further as Greg aptly points out. It sounds absurd to say but what we need is $20k bitcoins...

I've read the study before and very much liked the analysis. However... isn't it reductive to say that larger hashing equals greater security? The graph aspect of the network and, more importantly, the number of full mining nodes should play a factor in the story.

I think you're putting too much wood on the fire. Only 4 factors should count:

3) network total hashrate 
4) ratio of off-/on-chain transactions
The point on wealth distribution is very interesting but not quite feasible with a pseudonymous ledger.

Great! Why then not channel all this passion by both camps into proposing all together one major hard fork where we package these proposals together? On one hand we agree on a small blocksize bump, and on the other we agree to take the opportunity to streamline the protocol more. 
As mentioned in a recent post (the deserted island parable?), the push for a hard fork to happen ASAP is mostly the result of there not being any acknowledgement by core to even consider it at some point in the future despite an undeniably large interest in one (notice how I refuse the word "consensus" here - too charged for my taste). Like I already said, this is a very important political issue that must be confronted for everyone's benefit.

Greg (, with all due respect to both you and your excellently written up thoughts, you represent (to the public eye at least) the single most vehement opposition to a hard fork. 
For that matter, others on the dev list have highlighted how SegWit could be rolled out much more cleanly through a hard fork as opposed to what ultimately looks like phenomenal jerry rigging (I mean this as a compliment) on Core's part. 
I'm terms of operational scalability of the protocol we MUST gather data on rolling out hard forks. What better than the case of a static variable change (max blocksize). Particularly when it's useful exercise is enhanced by the peaceful political resolution that it would achieve. 
The network is small enough that worrying about a single node forgetting to upgrade is not big enough cause for stalling such a simple request to allow the natural growth and a adoption of the greater network protocol. 
I very much agree with you that there is a place for Lightning and Sidechains to aid rendering bitcoin a competitive payment protocol. However, capping it at this stage of its evolution  (both practically and ideologically) feels premature to say the least.

The rate can be inceased or lowered via SoftFork. Don't read too much into it. The great thing of this BIP (and a big first step) is making the blocksizes softforkable!
@_date: 2017-01-27 13:36:29
Guys seriously, read the entire BIP. 
A) the 300KB number is only valid if the BIP were activated before April of this year. More likely people would stick to the old 1MB protocol until Lightning and Segwit reduce fee pressures enough to make it sensible to activate. So basically he's predicting that full implementation of Segwit and Lightning will reduce block usage by ~70% thus making his hardford not shock the markets. Obviously if the reduction in block usage was on, say, 30% then we would all wait until the hard fork proposal would support 700KB blocks before hardforking.
B) THe growth rate initially set to the conservative value of 17.7% is softforkable! This is a very important first step as it makes blocksizes softforkable also!

This is incorrect. Even by observing the MW blockchain you have no direct link between spending and receiving addresses. In a sense, MW behaves like blockchain-wide CoinJoin. Unless the block contains one transaction only there is no way to associate identity among input/output addresses.
To do what you're saying, the attacker would have to be physically mining every single block or, at least, have access to all the transactions aggregated by whoever mines each block.

I think you may be overestimating bitcoin's network effect. A private effort could launch a private blockchain backed by banks guaranteeing a USD nominal value to their crypto coins and pushing them on the masses. Once institutional adoption takes place they setup a protocol for turning their blockchain into a public one with bitcoin's identical proof-of-work consensus scheme. All miners switch over to it due to the larger market and bitcoin is toast. I'm all for bitcoin but lets be realistic. We need to onboard A LOT more users before we can feel comfortable with our network effect.

Because, at face value, it'll potentially look more legit and likely easier for the average user to use. Take torrenting as a metaphor. People have been pirating movies/music/software for 20+ years now. Yet, the masses have preferred to adopt centralized digital media distribution services like spotify/itunes/netflix etc... Even PopcornTime, in all its user friendliness, hasn't been able to unseat the "oligarchs".
Nonetheless, what the pirating culture has achieved is creating a never-before seen competition with instituionalized businesses which has forced an enormeous reduction in prices for media distribution. This means less money in the hands of corporations.
By the same token, banks could react to bitcoin by finally accepting the need for a public blockchain but wanting more of a handle on its funds. If they produce a public blockchain with an immutable ledger and manage to garner more hash power for their proof-of-work than bitcoin, what difference will it make if they premine X% of the coins? 
The Bitcoin community can only fight this by incentivizing user adoption and case use fast enough that, by the time banks get their act together, it'll be more convenient for them to embrace our protocol rather than make a new one. This in turn can only happen if we first accept some sort of an ideological compromise first!  
Don't fixate on our community's ideologies. Granted that I support 100% of the "decentralize everything" attitude, one needs to be realistic in accepting that the vast majority of people don't give a damn about it. They just want the easiest, cheapest and most widely spread money that they can get their hands on.

I have to apologize that I mixed up two different events:
1) Your response to Dave Hudson's original critique of Peter_R's paper:
"Quite correct; this paper is fatally flawed and at best rehashes what we already know happens in the "spherical cow" case, without making it clear that it refers to a completely unrealistic setup. It'd be interested to know who actually wrote it - "Peter R" is obviously a pseudonym and the paper goes into sufficient detail that it makes you wonder why the author didn't see the flaws in it."
2) Your seemingly inflammatory response to Gavin's post (whose input I am still to understand) which this post's reddit sqwack seems to be all got and bothered about. 
I read the mailing posts in a row and, fixated on Dave Hudson's response,  side-by-side mangled them together. You aren't resonating for Hudson's remark and Hudson's critique of Peter_R's isn't the subject of this sub either.  My fault. I'm sorry. 
However, mailing list insults aside, the truly important matter here is your objections to Peter_R's paper which you flat out sentenced as "fatally flawed". 
Based on context, you seem to agree with Hudson's post and your choice of adjectives would seem to imply that you feel particularly strongly about it. So in a sense... I guess I'm "accusing" you of something that you seem to strongly imply. 
To exhaust all doubt, I think it would help the community for you to maybe clarify,  with a few more words,  your objections to the work on transaction fee markets under unlimited blocksizes. 
Sorry again for the confusion. I hope you understand that I'm simply trying to steer the conversation towards what truly matters about these mailing list exchanges.

"Doesn’t Unlimited mean Unlimited?  How can T-Mobile advertise Unlimited 4G LTE when T-Mobile doesn't offer it on all T-Mobile devices?
Yes, at T-Mobile, unlimited mean unlimited. Every T-Mobile Simple Choice™ Plan includes Smartphone Mobile HotSpot at no extra charge, and when customers reach their paid high-speed data allotment, speeds are reduced so they never worry about overages. Our standard Unlimited 4G LTE smartphone plan includes unlimited high-speed data on your smartphone and also comes with 7 GB high-speed Smartphone Mobile HotSpot data, followed by unlimited reduced-speed Smartphone Mobile HotSpot data."
What's stopping me from doing all my torrenting on my phone or using it as my cloud server? This would not use tethering, which T-mobile couldn't distinguish from one of their "hackers", and still easily consume 2 TB of bandwidth per month.
Unlimited is unlimited... stop whining or deal with it.

Peter Todd's objection to your work revolves around the fact that block propagation times are only though as depending on the blocksize and in no way depend on the miner's hashrate. To exemplify this fact he proposes as a limiting example the case of a hypothetical benevolent miner owning a majority of the network hashrate (say 99%). Since any mined block propagates instantaneously to himself, he won't produce any orphaned blocks and, as such, is incentivized to take on larger and larger blocks indefinitely.
From my understanding, as discussed in the paper, the block propagation time is a number which quantifies the average time taken to communicate a mined block to the majority of the network. This is argued to grow linearly with the blocksize (the more data in the block -&gt; the more data to transfer -&gt; the longer it will take) and can be easily modified to include the instantaneous propagation time to oneself. Denoting by 'h' and 'H' the miner's and network's hashrate respectively, the propagation time appearing in your calculations is straightforwardly modified to:
(for proper formatting: 
This implies that in all formula's from equation (10) onwards, one must simply modify 'Q' into '(1-h/H)Q' in all the exponential terms that appear.
The phenomenological aspects of the paper remain perfectly intact as the extra (1-h/H) factor trivially alters the slope of the supply/demand curves. Particularly, your proof for the impossibility of an "unhealthy" fee market still stands as the extra hashrate-dependent factor doesn't change the Q-dependent asymptotics of your equations.
I hope this helps. Please correct me if you find anything faulty with the reasoning.

That's precisely the point of the XT fork if you ask me. Mike and Gavin's radio silence after the fork simply push the hand. XT isn't going anywhere unless the the Fellowship of the Core somehow manages to do absolutely NOTHING in the next 12 months. It's obvious that eventually consensus must rally around an intermediate position. XT will flounder without causing any problems but Mike/Gavin will still have pride in that they catalyzed action.
Reaching a compromise is not that big of a deal. If the blocksize were raised to 1.01MB tomorrow nothing would happen to the network, no miner would complain and everyone will be happy. What Core needs to do at the very minimum is schedule a one-time blocksize increase. It doesn't even matter how much. Just enough to show progress and all will fall back into order.
Until then, my nodes are gonna run on XT.

Correct The only correction I'd add is that I am not flat out assuming that the chance a miner mined two blocks in a row was small enough to ignore. As you can read in my conclusions, all that matters is that the propagated block's size can be validated in time that is smaller than the block time for the two-in-a-row advantage (I call it "head-start") effect to be negligible over a long (relative to the block time) period of time.

The point that nobody is grasping is that there should be MORE forks! Why doesn't someone make a fork for every single BIP proposed?
That would be truly democratic. Nodes and miners would rally around their choice and we'd all move forward. Policy should be that no group of core devs gets to policy a Core fork in the absence of consensus. All fork options should be implemented and the network decides. 
 At the very least a fork should  be made with the BIP100 proposal and maintaining commit authority of the Bitcoin Core devs.
In this last respect, the single most chilling attribute of XT is that Mike Hearn gets last say in everything. 
@_date: 2015-08-29 19:33:20
Block sizes should be increased, and the mempool allowed to grow in order to minimize large miner advantages in the long run. Furthermore, since these advantages decrease with decreasing block subsidy (exponentially in time since the block subsidy does also), I'd argue that it is fine to allow the maximum block size to grow exponentially (think BIP101) as a means of guiding the network towards the formation of an uncapped fee market.

As Andreas says in the video, miners are more than welcome to optimize their activities. Developers can and will also though. The truth of the matter is that blocking any and all header modifications precludes a lot of upcoming upgrades to the network protocol. Doing so because you want to preserve your mining advantages is a de facto attack on the network.

As far as I'm concerned, either nobody jumps on the XT bandwagon in a reasonable amount of time thus confirming the low blocksize position OR people start turning to XT is lage enough numbers that consensus among Core developers is forced to settle on some in between blocksize increase in order to avoid losing control of the project.
XT really is there to gauge what the exact interest in larger blocksizes really is. It doesn't matter if their 75% miner participation triggers BIP101 or not.

"The difference is that the real genesis block starts with zero amount of work. It's simply the first block in the chain. There's nothing to validate before that."
Once everyone is agrees on the checkpointed block with committed UTXO set noone needs to see what came before it. It won't matter. We can all consent to that being the "first" block. Anybody who comes later doesn't need to know anything that happened on the blockchain previously to the checkpoint block. It holds a snapshot of the entire network up to that point period. All that will matter is that, given a checkpointed block, you can reconstruct the longest POW chain from it.
@_date: 2017-04-05 13:21:05
I'm not saying that they're easy. For one, there isn't even a discussion on methods to checkpoint the UTXO set (that I'm aware of). That said, putting aside the technical details of how one defines the contents of the checkpointed block, the act of checkpointing itself should be no different than a hardfork at the consensus level.

That said, i fully agree that SegWit enables long term scaling.

Also, the facts speak for themselves. They've already built a circuit capable of solving the Subset Sum problem.... An actual physical circuit. The particular design of that circuit might not be ideally scalable but that doesn't mean that its elements cannot be optimized.

Not to be the killjoy here but it must be mentioned that the current TX backlog would NOT be processed any faster if SegWit were active today due to it being made up entirely out of NON-SegWit transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:09:27
I agree with it all Greg, but undoubtedly more business models would be viable with SW enabled and the upgrade is looong over due. Please, I beg you... lets get this activated and over with. I keep dreaming of an out-of-left-field Spoonnet counterproposal to the NY agreement that undeniably proves a commitment to a HF after SW is activated on behalf of Blockstream. Not because Blockstream=Core but because your company image could do well with a makeover in our current climate and the community desperately needs a coming together moment.

I think that the most relevant piece of information here is that opposite sides of the aisle are finally talking to each other with respect as opposed to anger. This debate MUST end. Whether through UASF, MASF or backroom agreement. None of the touted options will cripple the network irreparably just like none of the options will be ideal for the entire community. Lets stop throwing shit at each other and accept compromise. If exchanges rally around UASF I'm all for it. If miners choose to agree to a small HF blocksize increase in combination with SegWit, fuck it... lets do it. We're really splitting hairs at this point. It's not like the other side is pushing 32MB blocks. At the same time, the mempool backlog will not be cleared by segwit alone since it consists entirely of legacy transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-20 10:18:03
I don't see where this movement plans to pull the extra ~20% of hashpower out of? The User-Activated (UA) part of UASF cannot work unless BIP148 has at least 51% of the mining network behind it.
@_date: 2016-05-23 08:32:19
Not necessarily. It's a great way, for example,  to hedge BTC downside volatility. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:00:00
I fully support this. I personally dream of a fully committed counter HF proposal submitted and undersigned by the majority of Core's developers. At this stage it's a matter of showing the will to compromise on basics. I'm sure that is this will and goodfaith is accepted, things such as timelines can be altered in exchange for both better features and a better technical implementation of the upgrade.
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:52:09
Honest question here. What's the point of UASF if 80% of miner hashrates are going to supposedly back Silbert's agreement? 
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:01:08
Yes. It does.

My gripe are the unnecessary shortcut changes and the raw design of the debian build. I'm hoping that the UX improves in the near future.

@_date: 2017-05-31 01:21:12
He's since retracted and seems in favor of signaling on bit 4 up to 80% of hashrate followed by bit 1 signaling to ensure that BIP141/148 nodes don't end up splitting. Am I misunderstanding it? The point here being that a non-neglectable portion of the community is accepting to signal segwit only if they can be assured that a HF will happen later. Jeff's move wasn't in bad faith, he was simply trying to have the code reflect the will of the charter's signing parties.
Yes... if 80%+ of the miner hashrate truly undersigns and stand by the charter, it's 'non-negotiable' that to have them signal for progress the charter's conditions need to be upheld. This leads back to my original question to you. How else are we going to define 'consensus'?
@_date: 2015-10-03 00:05:57
"Moreover, JiF supports a form of progressive interlacing (essentially a generalization/improvement of PNG's Adam7) which means that any prefix (e.g. partial download) of a compressed file can be used as a reasonable lossy encoding of the entire image."
This is pretty badass. i didn't know it worked that way. Then again, I'm and ignorant fool. :)
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:55:55
The only thing immoral, as far as I've come to understand it, would be if the proposed code was developed in a back room. It doesn't seem to be the case as part of the NY charter explicitly states the importance of transparent development from BIP to testing to deployment. If your issue is with businesses initially agreeing to the terms of the charter in a back room, instinctively I'd agree with you. However, if 80% of the network hashrate truly commits to these terms, doesn't it make us the minority? Lets put it another way... how do you realistically define consensus to yourself? It clearly can't be a handful of people deciding for everyone else but it can't also be the requirement that 100% of the network's actors agree. BIP141 seeked 95% miner signaling and that clearly turned out to be unrealistic also. Since developers have been discussing the lowering of SW's activation threshold to 75-80% for a while now through BIP91, how is this different from the NY charter potentially gathering 80% of mining support as far as 'consensus' stands?
Maybe, however, by immorality you refer to Jeff's initial bit 4 proposal being explicitly incompatible with BIP141/148 nodes? However, it seems more than clear to me that this problem is both surmountable and fixeable. Just because the initial code proposal was flawed doesn't mean we have to banish its intents from existence. Lets all be constructive please. The community really needs the expertise and active conservatism brought by developers such as yourself. We need it as a countermeasure to the libertine pressures which risk to crash and burn the entire network. But, in the absence of science explicitly giving us hard bounds, lets accept that we must show some flexibility to progress (and rebound from any flaws we may stumble upon).

The paragraph in question:
"Palantir’s defence systems include advanced biometrics and walls impenetrable to radio waves, phone signal or internet. Its data storage is blockchained: it cannot be accessed by merely sophisticated hacking, it requires digital pass codes held by dozens of independent parties, whose identities are themselves protected by blockchain."

But why not use BIP91 for the SW part of the deployment?

Who gives a shit. If it does it does, if it doesn't it doesn't. This entire community is about giving people the freedom to try random experiments with the blockchain. If people want to use RSK's extended blocks for financial activity so be it. They know the risk they're taking and they also know the rewards they stand to make. Who the fuck are we for criticizing honest development?

There are agreements and agreements. Comparing SegWit2x, a proposal striving to mediate between two scaling positions debated ad nauseam over the past two years, *supposedly* endorsed by entities representing 80%+ of the network hashpower, cannot possibly be compared to a sudden change of coin issuance. At this point it's not a debate anymore but a simple battle of egos. We can either accept the suboptimal solution and reunite the community understanding that any future bugs due to the suboptimality of the chosen proposal will have to be ironed out OR we can split the network, risk destroying bitcoin's value proposition and, in the event of a successful post-split transition, risk handing over the entire reference implementation to a completely new set of developers that don't have an ounce of our trust.
I've always been supportive of the Core devs but they're losing this battle on a social level. If only they owned up to SegWit2x we would be debating about when to have the 2x HF on a more realistic and safe schedule rather than simply counting down to our network forking once and for all between small and big blockers. As much as I love BIP148, we all know how this is going to end up: 2 coins and another endless battle for the ownership of the Bitcoin name.
Maybe it's at this point that Litecoin comes in to save the day as Bitcoin's backup network...
