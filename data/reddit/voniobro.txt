@_date: 2014-02-07 04:57:10
I believe there is two sets of info needed to send coins. The SIM card ID and then a pin number that you have to give after the main server calls you. So the gateway could only have 1 key of a 2 key system. I suppose u/37Coins could explain it better.
@_date: 2014-03-17 15:46:55
Yeah, it'll be a pain. But you can back up the codes that generate the 2FA. It all comes down to balancing convenience with security. At this point in the game, if you are involved in bitcoin, you have to side with security.

Jonathan, from 37coins here. Fees are set by the Gateway providers (the people that bridge between the SMS network and the 37coins servers on the internet). It is free to set up a Gateway. If you think the fees are too much, set one up and set a lower fee. All you need is a cellphone plan, and an old Android phone.  (The fee's goto the gateway provider, btw. So, it's an easy way to earn, BTC. You just need to get others to use your gateway^^)
The gateway system is decentralized and open-source with the intent of promoting market competition. The reason the fees are so high right now is because there is not enough competition. 
Soon we will be rolling out a new version of the SMSgateway Android app. It is going to be a lot easier to open gateways. So, there should be more gateways and the price per transaction should go down.
Also, at this point, users are charge a flat-fee. So the cost is the same, regardless if it is $0.10 or $100.
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:24:45
Yes we are. Looks like a fun toy. 
However, when our system asks for verification about a transaction, the message goes to the real phone number, not the spoofed number. And that is only one measure that we use to protect users accounts. There is also a second factor that happens for large value transactions. In that case, we call the user (which is a separate channel than SMS) and ask for a 4-digit PIN that only the user knows.
@_date: 2014-05-21 01:03:53
Look like all of those are social engineering hacks. Any system that deals with humans are susceptible to them.

Jonathan, from 37coins here. Thanks for your interest. This is why I got excited about bitcoin, too. As a long-term vision, I would love to see our SMSwallet system to help empower people to be in control of their own financial freedom and to connect them to the global economy. If you there is a particular country that you think needs bitcoin, find a way to get a gateway setup there (that person, in turn, will be able to earn bitcoin). We are live in about 14 countries right now, but we want to be in all 163+.
@_date: 2014-05-21 00:22:45
Jonathan from 37coins here. For anyone concerned about the centralization of the keys, we are still in beta. One of the core concepts that we are pursuing is multi-sig on low-tech Android devices. This means that we need a multi-sig implementation in BitcoinJ. We've started a small bounty to help make this happen and make sure it is open-source way.

One could argue that, if these were to go up for auction against multiple deep-pocketed buyers we would see what institutional investors really believe bitcoins are worth. If Bank of America really believes that the fair-market value of one bitcoin is $1300 each...
I imagine that these auctions will be public, and that we will eventually know the final sale price of the coins. This should be interesting.

We would only pay ourselves with 'after-tax' money. 
Kinda looking for a company (or exchange, I guess) that will help to automate this process. We are busy, and so are other people. So something that keeps track of the purchase price and does it everyweek automatically would be cool.
There is only 3-5 of us right now. So we can totally do this manually. But I also don't want to spend a lot of time each month doing trades, etc.

This rule (if it igoes into effect) could have some interesting unintended consequences for Australia. It would reduce the potential income sources for Aus companies. And, if a company did accept BTC, they wouod have a large incentibe to hold the BTC, or spend it as BTC with their suppliers. Thus it would reduce the demand for Aus dollars.

Got it. I've purchased bitcoins off of Gox (before they went belly up ;-), BTC-e, and Bitstamp before.
But, as a budding business owner, I'm looking for something that I just setup once and then is a simple process each month to pay everyone in bitcoin. Maybe something that is ACH connected so that it can be a simple  (I'm US based) USD transfer.

That's a lot of information to give for just a $10 donation. The point being that if I'm her uncle and filling out this form gives me pause, anyone else with weaker ties will be even more put off by the extra effort required. This is called friction.


Do you know the difference between a payment processor and an exchange market?

Yeah, I've sent coins to my nephews as gifts. And I could just send her money that way. But if I just send her money directly, it doesn't show support to other 'would-be' donors. I think it's still valuable to have a system that works with a visible donation counting page, I guess.

Theres a bitcoin start-up called  that is working on this exact problem. The key with their system is that a local person hosts an internet connected Android gateway that lets anyone with a SMS capable phone use Bitcoin. More than one gateway phone numbet can exist so connections can be redundant and decentralized.
The second key feature is a 2FA authentification that relies on the SIM for one key and a voicecall sent PIN for the second key. This makes Bitcoin use on SMS secure.

Fees are set, and earned, by the gateway operators. Anyone can be a gateway operator by signing up through the 37coins.com website. You just need to have a dedicated Android phone (any old one will work), an SMS plan and an internet connection. In this way, our system is decentralized (and open-source) and it is easy to setup in any country.
Currently the fees are per transaction and vary depending on the cost of sending SMS. In the US, for example, the fee ranges from 0.10 mBTC - 0.19 mBTC (~$0.04-$0.08). The fee is the same whether you are sending $0.10 - $100 worth of bitcoin.

Two things are contributing to the stability, in my opinion. One, people no longer trust their exchanges to hold their coins. Thus there are less coins queued in exchanges to be sold at a whim. Two, with tbe news of New York regulating a bitcoin exchanges is the financial capital of the world, new investors are likely waiting for a new, reliable exchange to open there before buying bitcoins.

My Korean reading is not great. So this maybe a bit inaccurate, but here goes:
It seems this is a collaboration between Coinplug and Hanapay Asia. I think it mentions there is no extra fees other than the normal exchange fee. (0.7-0.8%) If it is your first use you can only withdraw 300,000 Won (~$300) and you can do that up to 3 times a day. The machine will be open to the public on March 10th 11AM. It is located in one of the coffeshops in the basement of the COEX Mall (카페 커피세도나). 
The president of Coinplug wanted to have this machine so that people can see how to use bitcoin in person. And he wants to build something like the Bitcoin Center in New York for people that are interested in bitcoin to meet. Lastly, he mentioned something about online shopping payments and online gaming payments.
