I would just like to point out the wealth gap issue isn't about the difference of what the average men make vs the average women make, it's the difference between what the average man/woman make in the exact same position, in the same location, with the same experience.

Has anyone here ever asked the question: what if McAfee wants his dick eaten? And he's just playing us for fools

While I'm sure that's the case, I'm curious about if the devs actually account for this somehow. Because a collision could completely corrupt the block chain right? And there's a non zero chance of a collision happening

Maybe we'll have time on the way down

So it's my understanding that transactions are hashed by sha256, but it gets hashed to a value with less characters than the original transaction. By pigeonhole principle doesn't this mean that multiple transactions are mapped to the same bucket?
How does the block chain resolve this, is it just a statistically "impossible" event that everyone just hopes never happens?

I know it hasn't happened in a while but it's foolish to think nations won't ever have to go to war to defend their sovereignty again

Look up dollar cost averaging. You spend the same usd amount each week, but you end up buying more bitcoins when they are cheap and less when they are expensive

Anyone who talks about the wage gap by comparing all men vs all women is an idiot - I can agree with you there. For the rest of our disagreement I'm not sure it's worth it to have the argument, seems a little off topic for this sub

I'm assuming this has an answer to my question? I'm at work atm I'll check it when I get home

But what about real wars that the government needs to fight?

Yea you could do that in theory. But what happens if it fluctuates around the 10k mark 50 times in a day

Buy high sell low is a joke not actual advice

I doubt this is an attack, just an intense selloff from bots probably overloaded their backend. This happens whenever a huge volume moves very quickly

So do we wait for a dip or buy now. I would like to hear both sides of this preferably

Whelp I guess we are going to find out

How do you short bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:21:35
I wouldn't mind that tbh, good chance to get cheap coins
