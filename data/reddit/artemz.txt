I think that we are also buying bitcoins on quite a huge rate here in Russia, but its clear that most russians making search requests in russian and not necessary that they use Google since Yandex still is more popular here.

If/when butterflylabs will make extremely effective ASIC mining rigs as they promised, then bitcoin price will go down. In other case, it can go down only together with demand

TOR is effictively blocked both in China and Iran.

It's not a big problem for governments like in China to start filtering your bandwith using DPI and connection probe hardware which can effectively block any encrypted connections, e.g connections between bitcoin clients. In fact, I2P and TOR currectly completely blocked in China, so if they want they can block bitcoin too.

Shutting down one single communication protocol has nothing to with shutting down the entire internet.

Well, yes. So what?

Government always can shutdown bitcoin, it's just a little bit more tough for them to do. So there is almost the same risk with bitcoin.

I heard solar panels are not really price effective thing

I just seen a link to bitcoin.org somewhere and decided to give it a try on my partially broken Atom D525 netbook. Then I forgot about it for a week or so, found it with 1000 BTC in the wallet later.
Probably got downvoted for smileys or grammar (I'm not a native speaker, I'm sorry)

I'm afraid they still can cut off bitcoin protocol using DPI hardware just like China blocks any TOR, Proxy, VPN traffic.

Unity is not shit, it just requires some time to get used to.

I'm in the same bandwagon, dude. Spend all my btc on a flat and furniture when the price was 29.9. Well, at least now I have a place to live with my gf and it's all for nothing given that I mined all that btc on my netbook in yearly 2010. I'm kind of sad at the moment, but I'm not the one to complain. Wait until the price goes down to the dirt and happily buy everything back while watching others crying :-)  Think positive ;-)

Move to Russia. It's a nanny totalitarian state indeed, but in fact nobody gives a flying fuck here and many internet providers dont bother to block any websites. We also have borsch and vodka!

I'm not sure if I'm a terrorist or not. How do I check?

I sold everything at 29.5 (((( No idea why everyone is so happy or excited about current bubble, I hope it will burst spectacularly

DPI itself can't really recognize anything inside an encrypted packet, it's only can be done using SVM (support vector machines).
Currently, I can't image the states adopting anything like the great firewall, but what happens when something becomes a serious threat to the economy?
