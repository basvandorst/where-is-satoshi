So the housing market will collapse further?  So I should just continue to rent until Bitcoin causes house values plummet under sub $100k values?  What about going to college? Will Bitcoin also cause student tuition to drop?  Otherwise you can't expect teenagers from a poor upbringing to save enough for 4 years of college tuition.  I just don't see how Bitcoin suddenly wipes out the necessity of credit.

Are you kidding me?
@_date: 2014-09-30 13:10:11
thanks man, how much you have invested in btc?
@_date: 2014-09-30 02:39:37
I hardly consider it a gamble.  Risky investment, but my valuation has me coming out way ahead of the CC interest.  
@_date: 2014-07-06 18:19:17
Explain how you achieved your prediction.  I would love to hear it.
@_date: 2014-09-30 02:42:35
You and me both brotha!

I think it has hit its absolute floor.  I think it only goes up from here.  
@_date: 2014-09-30 18:06:51
Because the loan system and credit system in this country is corrupt.  I will likely declare bankruptcy if I must.

The bailout was from poor underwriting on mortgages that were sold off to GSEs and packaged into MBS.  Bitcoin wouldn't have prevented this issue.
Bailout money wasn't free money for the banks.  It was $200+ billion in temporary relief AKA a loan.  The money has been repaid to the US treasury by the banks.  The US treasury realized profit from interest and dividends on TARP funding.  You are so misinformed, it's scary.  
Banking is essential to any economy.  Could you imagine no lending and financing?  You think the system is rigged now? Imagine middle class and lower class families and individuals without access to financing for student loans, cars, houses, small businesses. The rich would always remain rich while the poor and middle class would die out.

dude its at like a 45 week low.... Just wait.

This thread is embarrassing.  Fuck the banks!  Until all these people realize they need bank financing to go to school, buy a car, buy a house, start a business, and etc.  A lot of retail banks currently have razor thin margins due to the low rate environment and these "fees" provide a small earning boost through non-interest income.  The common retail banker is not making as much as people here think.  People just automatically associate banks with only the mega-banks.  The banking system is a lot larger than Chase, BoA, and Wells Fargo

How are any of you going to buy homes with out banks?

I have never missed a payment. I'm not a deadbeat.

Can someone explain to me how bitcoin solves this supposed banking system problem?  Banks offer a low cost service of holding and insuring your money safely.  Bitcoin is riddled with complex procedures for any person to safely secure their holdings on their own. Banks will exist regardless of the currency being held, whether it's USD or BTC.
@_date: 2014-09-30 13:09:56
My valuation of BTC puts me way ahead of the interest and fees.  Once I double up I will pay off the CC.
@_date: 2014-09-30 13:28:52
Why's that?  Because I make educated investment decisions? Better than her maxing out all her credit cards for shoes and clothes.  You know how much money she wasted? 
@_date: 2014-09-30 02:49:34
I will get the last laugh, trust me.

Good for me. Jealousy for you.

Please stop, it's painful. LOL.
@_date: 2014-08-19 18:16:14
You are joking, right?  Boy am I'm happy I'm no longer pro-bitcoin.  You are embarrassing. 
Bitcoin  simply doesn't have any real great technological advantages over US currency.

I'll cut back on my takeout bills.. minimum payments should be around $190. Pay with fiat.

I'm dismissing your links after reading for 30 seconds.


So the starting premise of the story, that the government "spent" (or "wasted") US$700 billion on a bank bailout program (TARP) is essentially entirely false from the beginning.  It was reduced to $475 billion by Dodd-Frank.  I don't have the time to go through the rest of Mother Jone's fuzzy accounting and numbers.
@_date: 2014-09-30 13:11:14
up almost 3% 12 hours in.  100% probably in 2-3 months and I will pay off those credit cards then.  Those fees won't matter in the long run.  
@_date: 2014-09-30 02:49:10
What would be the best way to protect my bitcoin wallet?  I'm new to this haha

This thread displays the embarrassing state of bitcoin advocates.

I haven't had free cash to drop on bitcoin (alimony and child support been raping me), so I finally have a way to get in!  Luckily its a good time to buy since its so low.
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:54:24
Probably those with the ability to realize that without bank financing, we would have little economic growth.  How many people we be able to purchase a house without a bank? A car?  How many qualified student would be unable to attend higher education? How would vital infrastructure investments be financed?  How would anyone get a small business running?  You think the system is rigged against the 99% now? Imagine shutting down access to all basic financing that banks offer.   
The rhetoric that banks are evil is for lazy and narrow-minded.  Banks will always exist, regardless of the currency.  Some of you should get over it.

The Credit Suisse fine was for tax evasion.  Majority of the people here are evading taxes.
