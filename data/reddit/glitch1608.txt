Ask him if he would be willing to do an AMA here at r/bitcoin

I've used it before as well for stuff I didn't really care about... however, for 100k+ or whatever worth of bitcoin, I'd be willing to spend a couple thousand to have the professionals recover it. 
Last drive I sent out for recovery with a malfunctioning head (click of death) cost me about $2500 but they were able to do a full recovery.

Sorry, but this is terrible advice for something potentially worth $100,00+. 
Plug the drives in to an external USB enclosure, if they don't boot up immediately or if they start clicking/grinding, turn it off and ship the drives off to a professional recovery service. 
Freezing the drive or running them for prolonged periods of time will significantly reduce the chance of anything being recovered.

I see this a lot when people mention paying subscriptions with bitcoin (especially porn)
I would think that is a pretty useful problem to solve in the bitcoin space. Is anyone working on a way to easily set up recurring payments with bitcoin?

My strategy was to panic, cry, mentally abuse myself for an hour or two. After that I took a xanax and went to bed. Feel much better this morning even though I'm still down a large margin!
tl;dr use some of your btc to buy xanax

Maybe someone misread the news article and are trying to buy Virgin Galactic, not just a flight on it?

Lol, just pull the guts out and sit them on something non conductive. Better airflow too that way and less wasteful of those precious zipties.

I feel like we should be moving to bitpesos instead

Noo, please don't crash yet. I have to wait at least 2 more days to make another purchase on coinbase :(

Honestly if I were you I would cash out and pay off all debt. Then take take the mortgage + car payment money and stick it all into a Roth IRA, then 401k. Once those are maxed think about investing back into bitcoin again.
