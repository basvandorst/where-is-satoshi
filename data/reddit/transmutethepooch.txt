I made a post a few days explaining those depth charts. Let me know if you have any questions about it.
You may want to sub as well.

I love your channel! I've rewatched a few of your videos several times. Encryption (Diffie-Hellman, RSA), information entropy. Great stuff! Makes sense that you'd be coming out with a bitcoin video. Keep up the awesome work.

Bottom axis shows dollar amounts. 
Put your finger on a dollar amount under the green area and follow it up to the top of the green. The height of the green represents the number of people willing to buy at that dollar amount. If a seller offers to sell at that dollar amount, a buyer will buy and the height of the green will go down at that dollar amount.
Put your finger on a dollar amount under the red area and follow it up to the top of the red. The height of the red represents the number of people willing to sell at that dollar amount. If a buyer offers to buy at that dollar amount, a seller will sell and the height of the red will go down at that dollar amount.
There's usually a "V" shape with the green meeting the red at the current price because many people are buying/selling at that dollar amount and the green/red height won't get very high -- as soon someone offers to buy, someone is there ready to sell, and vice versa, so the green/red height stays low. 
Farther from the current price, more people are waiting so the green and red get higher. Buyers want a deal and want to buy cheap, sellers want a deal and want to sell high, and so the height grows as you move away from the current price.
