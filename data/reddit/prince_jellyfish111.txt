How does one go about buy such? Lol

With an average of 340 BTC moved per transaction?
At current prices that's moving 2.7 mill a transaction.
That account has been open for 3 years, which means it completes about 295 transactions  day. 
Which makes total sense as a trader.... carry on!

But why?

This is the biggest issue with crypto. It's used as an investment and not as a currency. The volatility of the market is from profit taking. 
If BTC or any crypto is going "be" something it needs to be fully utilized.

I feel like you're not conveying what you think you are. 
Can you try saying it another way?

What's another option that can mitigate this?

Charts dont lie but peoples interpretation of them do.

Twitter CEO: no fees!
Reality: you buy 20% higher then current ask and sell 20% then current ask and we keep the difference

I just did brain math but your right on %  I have been using it this week and it added up for me to roughly 20% (in cash terms) of what I was buying or selling.

How will you spend your coin if it does all come crashing down around us?

I wasn't asking to be a dick, I'm genuinely asking.  
I've played with the idea of buy Bitcoin (right now I wish I had) but my ignorance on buying, trading, and securing has kept me from doing so. 
Someone mentioned gold so let's take the two as a juxtaposition. 
Let's assume hes correct, a crash is looming, soon. Winter is coming. You have two options. Buy gold or by crypto. 
You buy gold, you have a physical asset in which to trade. 
You buy Butcoin or crypto and you.......
That's what I dont understand.

Early adapters. Ironically, it's probably the same folks that will ultimately be regulating it.

Nooooo... is that even possible?
