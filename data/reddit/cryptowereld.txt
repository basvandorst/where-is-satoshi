Where was the sale made? thuisbezorgd.nl
What did you buy/sell? pizza, kebab and a bottle of soda
What was the attitude of the staff facilitating the transaction or customer? it was an online transaction
What was the experience like for you? supereasy
What was your motivation for making the transaction using bitcoin? I thought it was a good deal, spending 0,2 bitcoin on food instead of just paying cash.
What do you see as the advantages or disadvantages to using bitcoin for the specific type of business and type of item sold? The fact that I paid 0.2 bitcoin for 20 bucks of food says enough. I'm not gonna make this *mistake* again buy using them. At least not for a while.

The one thing I always do in a crypto-fiat discussion is ask them to answer the question they have about crypto, like BitCoin, and answer that question first about fiat. For example:
When someone asks me: How does BitCoin work? I ask them to answer: How  does money work?
What gives BitCoin it's value? I ask: what gives the Euro it's value? ( and if they answer something like: the government does that, I ask why and I also have a good statement about BitCoin later in the conversation)
What makes BitCoin secure? What makes fiat secure.
You get the point

You're using your download pc (Utorrent) to take care of your BitCoin? You're an example of someone that got his coins stolen and blaims the exchanges. No offence, but get yourself an 8gb usb stick and install ubuntu onto it to use your BitCoin. Usb sticks are cheap these days and this will prevent your coins from getting stolen.

Bitcoin World has coinbase, bitpay, overstock, tigerdirect, zynga...and silk roak (v2?).
I'm not going to promote a site that allows people deal drugs online, but I am gonna promote the way it works. I have never used that website myself, but I have visited it out of curiosity and heard and read enough about it.
The site works with a trust system. Users gain trust point, left by users that have dealt with them. I don't understand why this system is not yet available for ordinary stuff. 


I know what you mean and I feel the same way. For this reason a trust based system should work. I know it's not a solution, but I think it can be a first step towards an infrastructure that's built on reputation.

I would consider buying one, but only for one rig, my gaming rig. Once I'm done mining I am gonna take some of my cards and built myself and ultimate gaming rig. However, the design need these options:
- (at least) 6 x hot swap bay 5.25 inch
- (at least) 3 x hot swap bay for ssd
- Not 6, but 3x room for pcie 16x (triple crossfire)
- Glas shield at the front, with fans at the bottom (with filter) AND fans at the top
- Built-in fan control with sensor
- Built in LED, with controller
- Cable management at the top of the case (since the motherboard is sideways)
- Back plate for the motherboard &amp; easy acces
- Room for a big cpu cooler
- Room for ram &amp; coolblock
- Room for optional 2x psu 
Yup, if it offers all this, I would definitely buy one for $199,-.
I think it should be possible to achieve this, considering a ps4 is only 399,- with all the hardware.

I'm gonna get downvoted, but gonna say it anyway
*Who profits from the existence of Bitcoin ?* I would say *NOT* the USA because it will lose it's power to print money. The USA should fear cryptocurrencies the most, because printing money is what keeps the USA standing. 
*To weaken all other world currencies so that in the end we will have Bitcoin because of it's superior qualities as a currency and the USD backed by the most powerful world army and the unit of purchase of petrol the dominant energy source.* In the end, we will have the Bitcoin technology, Bitcoin itself does not have the superior qualities over other cryptocoins. The USD might be backed by *an* army, but certainly not the most powerful world army. The USD is *NO* longer *THE* unit of purchase of petrol. Countries that trade with China are already using the Yuan to do that.

Biggest problem that will occur imho is that if this someday might happen, is that miners stop mining in the process. This means hashrate goes down and the attack can continu.

All of the business models you describe have already proven that they don't work. Wikipedia tries to use another one, but they literally have to beg to get funded.
The ad system works to earn money, I never said it didn't.
I'm just one of the users that wants to have a choice. A choice that most companies don't give me these days.
For example, I pay for all the apps I use because I don't want ads. If an app has ads, I simply delete the app or block the app. But I also delete an app when I don't like an app. So even if it doesn't have ads like your website, I still will delete it or not use it.
I know people like to get things for free, but business models are already changing. Take a look at tv, a lot of people decided to pay for services like netflix and hbo. Two reasons for that, watch whenever you want and NO commercials. 
So I said the business model needs a change, I didn't say I had one for you.

The question for me is: Why would someone use this as an mining case? I just think they can make more profit focussing on the aftermining market.

I use these open alu cases that cost me about $30, and most people think that is much for a mining rig.

If we both got 500 dollar to spend on a laptop or macbook, I know for certain that the laptop will be better. If you can even buy a new macbook foor 500 dollars, it's so outdated you can't even watch a fullHD youtube video. 
If we both spend a 2000 dollar on a laptop or macbook, I also know for sure the laptop will have better specifications and will be faster. 
The difference is in it's usability. I always compare a laptop with lego and a mac with duplo. Using lego is so much more complicated than duplos. And you can do a hell of a lot more with lego. Using duplo on the other hand is much easier, even a three year old can use it, same with apple material.

Taking my time is the best thing that happend to me in the cryptocommunity. 
When I wanted to invest and start with my ideas with bitcoin, but I thought I should first learn some more about this technology. So instead of putting my money on bitcoin, I thought I should first play around with some (low value) litecoin. Buying litecoin was too much hassle, so I started mining it. Got a few of those every day, used several wallets to play with them them and all of a sudden, BAM, they were worth 30 bucks. (and instant ROI)
So there I was, sitting on a stack of litecoin, worth more than I could ever wished for (this is of course an understatement, I hope it will go up even more everyday). 
I still wanted to learn more about cryptocurrencies before getting serious, so I encrypted my wallets, changed some for bitcoin and put them in some safe places. 
After I did that, I still wanted to learn more about cryptocurrencies. Than Dogecoin came around, a coin made as a joke, so I started mining that since day 2. Difficulty was very low, got myself a decent stack of doge in no-time. Next thing I know, dogecoins price skyrocketed. 
Same story all over again, changed some more for bitcoin, encrypted everything and put it all in storage.
Untill this day, I'm still learning about cryptocurrencies. And untill I am absolutely sure that I can deliver some business involving cryptocurrencies without failure, I won't start it. 
I really think this technology is serious and I'm in for the long run. However, I will not put 100% of my faith in it. I still consider this whole thing as a big (very succesfull with up and downs) experiment and I hope others will do so too.
tl;dr: I think OP is right, take your time to sort everything out.  As long as you and I are working to get serious businesses, we can only go up.

And when you have $xx amount to spend, you probably get more from a regular laptop.


And this statement is not all true. If you want to buy a macbook winth only $500, you probably get a 2008 model. I can tell you from my own experience, this thing is so slow the usability is pure crap. But you can still buy a $500 laptop that's still pretty decent.
Buy whatever device you like, but don't compare a $500 device with a $2000 dollar device.

If bitcoin really threatens the dollar and/or the US economy, 1.1 billion is peanuts. Take a look a the us debt 
And also keep in mind that asics aren't that expensive to produce. Asics on the market contain huge profits. If a factory would mass produce them, it wouldn't come even near a billion. You don't think a government would order these online, do you? And not only that, if they really would this this,they would shut down or even use some of the pools too.

You're right. I'm just saying that they could if they wanted too.
And I already commented this in another post: ''keep in mind that asics aren't that expensive to produce. Asics on the market contain huge profits. If a factory would mass produce them, it wouldn't come even near a billion.''

No, I'm just making a joke about the name 'Satoshi Nakamato', which can be interpretted as 'central intelligent'.

Because people tend to compare a $2000 macbook with a $500 laptop. 
If I were to compare a $2000 dollar laptop with a $500 dollar macbook, you would say the same about the laptop.
Apples and oranges.
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:13:25
I have absolutely no clue what you mean by that.
@_date: 2014-04-15 13:42:35
Great, now I can say 'I told you so' towards my anti-cryptocurrency friends, *again*.
They told me it wouldn't go up again, so I bought 5 @ $411 to prove my point. Just sold for $492. It's nice to be right.
Still holding my other coins in cold storage though.
