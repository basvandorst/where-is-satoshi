That's a nice story, but *every* exchange has been slammed with signups and trading volume during run-up of recent months.

Note also that the linked article is a press release issued by Overstock.com. Not often that a company explicitly declares a price war. In this case calling it a "price war" might be aspirational as Amazon might simply ignore Overstock's moves.

Yeah, found where I read that, a CoinDesk story — so take it for what it's worth!

Of all money (assuming total BTC takeover), not wealth. Pedantic maybe, but "wealth" includes real estate, securities, commodities...

I read somewhere that customarily, if the application is going to be denied, the applicant is quietly notified beforehand so that they can withdraw the application in a sort of face-saving way. So you might be more likely to see an announcement that the applicant firms have withdrawn their applications due to a likely denial than an actual official announcement from the SEC.

From the WSJ: 
"The virtual currency bitcoin is getting a very real boost on Monday, with the opening of the first licensed U.S. exchange.
"Coinbase Inc., a startup backed by $106 million from the New York Stock Exchange, banks and venture-capital firms, said its exchange will offer greater security for individuals and institutions to trade bitcoin and monitor real-time pricing of the cryptocurrency."

Yeah, Medium seems like a good candidate

Here's a block explorer for litecoin, by the way. 
As of now, looks like they've mined 4 segwit blocks.
@_date: 2017-04-26 17:32:21
To add to the points made in the article, it seems to me that a lot of this Litecoin Roundtable is likely to be propagandistic in nature. 
As shaolinfry points out, segwit on Litecoin was already on the way to being activated with broad community as well as &gt;75% miner support before hostile pools started adding hash rate in order to block it. Then the hostile miners demanded a summit and agreement before allowing segwit to activate. 
The similarities of this Litecoin Roundtable with the Bitcoin Roundtable of Feb. 2016 is no coincidence: agreement for segwit activation followed by big blocks (even though the rationale for bigger blocks on Litecoin is questionable, especially with segwit activated). Activation of segwit on litecoin under the Roundtable terms furthers the hostile miners' PR narrative that they would have followed through allowing segwit activation on Bitcoin if only Core hadn't broken their side of the agreement, and that the entire affair hinges on a philosophical disagreement about big blocks. Therefore it distracts from discussion the fact that certain actors have a financial interest in blocking segwit on Bitcoin at all costs due to asicboost.

From my initial read on this, he's saying that an ASIC manufacturer (presumably Bitmain) is employing an exploit that "can allow an attacking miner to save up-to 30% of their energy
costs." If SegWit is implemented, they will no longer be able to take advantage of this exploit. Hence, the entire BU drama. 
If this is true, then when recently suggested that the whole BU drama is based on realpolitik rather than a genuine philosophical differences about scaling, he was right on the money, assuming I have the right read on things.   
@_date: 2017-04-01 22:09:46




Very interesting. Could you or someone else elaborate on this theory? How would a delay in the manufacture of ASICs incentivize miners to stall segwit adoption? 
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:14:06
Yeah, no. First, without wanting to delve into a discussion on Obamacare, the idea that  people don't agree with you only because they are just stupid and uninformed is usually wrong, notwithstanding the Jimmy Kimmel clip and Facebook thread you have presented as evidence. 
Anyhow, Segwit and BU elements of a political battle in the Great Powers and realpolitik sense. It doesn't really matter whether you can use slogans and branding to lure mouth-breathers back from r/btc.

Because competition and difficulty adjustments tend to drive mining profit toward zero, a 20% (actually up to 30%) reduction in the cost of electricity (the main cost of mining) can increase profits by many times.

The patent issue adds more interesting wrinkles. Presumably the patent owner can enjoin the sale of ASICs with infringing tech in jurisdictions with strong IP protection like the EU or USA. But will they be able to enjoin the manufacture and sale of infringing miners in China, though? Does the Chinese regime have any reason to prefer the status quo and will that affect the IP enforcement? *popcorn*
Edit: ok, so apparently Jihan owns a Chinese patent for ASICBOOST? Curiouser and curiouser.

Or, they understand quite well that Schnorr signatures in Bitcoin are quite a ways off, thus they invented the need to wait for Schnorr signatures as a justification for putting off Segwit in Bread indefinitely.

Awesome. These are useronboard teardowns are excellent, especially for UX folks. This (offtopic!) one for the United app (posted in the wake of that one dude being dragged off the plane, IIRC) is great, too:

Why hasn't, say, a VC-backed Silicon Valley company emerged designing cutting-edge mining chips to be fabbed in Taiwan or Korea by TSMC or Samsung? I assume there's a reason this hasn't happened, but I'm curious to know what it is.
Or maybe some existing company like AMD could start a mining-chip line of business — they've already sort of accidentally profited from their GPUs being used to mine other cryptocurrencies:
