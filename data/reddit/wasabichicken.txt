Yet I'm struggling to find even a single historic example where that has ever been true. Among the counterexamples, contemporary America serves as a good example of a wealthy, first-world nation where a large portion of its citizens are homeless despite there being [enough vacant houses to shelter them all](
Meanwhile, the happiest countries appear to be regulated Scandinavian markets, like [Norway, Denmark and Sweden]( Singapore, a relatively deregulated market where money flows relatively freely, finished last on this particular "happy list".
But disregarding all that, even if we pretend for a moment that deregulated capitalism *does* make a country, on average (but with the wealth collected in fewer hands), richer... if we forget about the soft values like happiness, stuff that money can't buy and is difficult to measure, what does huge income inequalities give us? Well, riots and unrest, for one. Where the police manage to keep the unruly poor under control, we get soaring prison populations. We get high crime (obviously, people got to eat) and murder rates, and generally a more militarized society.
Any moron understands that nothing is a bigger waste of funds than maintaining a high police- and military budget that buys you nothing but an uneasy peace at best and expensive civil wars at worst: society simply do not develop well during times of conflict where infrastructure and cars is demolished and burnt, where working-hours and lives alike are lost. Conflict inhibits free trade, inhibits productivity, so peace must clearly be *worth* something even to the most neoliberal of laissez-faire war-hawks.
And if that price in nonetheless paid, if peace is somehow maintained through oppressive force? If the unruly populace is being kept under the iron boot of the police, their civil rights suspended citing the "war on terror"? Well, we'd be living in military dictatorships, hardly different from the free markets in South America in the 60's and 70's. We'd not be free at all.

I'm aware of the criticism towards the book, and while I agree with some of it (some parts oozes conspiracy theory, for example), I still find the story of events a fascinating read. Plenty of the events described matches what's in public sources and history books, and while the motives and intentions of some key players might be taken with a grain of salt, there are plenty of direct quotes that supports them. As with all political texts, I suggest people read it with the academic mindset of source criticism at every turn.


Well, yes. She's arguing that every historical attempt at implementing free markets have led to vast income differences and huge profits for a small corporate elite. If one makes a distinction between them, I'm sure you agree that a truly "free market" has yet to exist.

Can we please stop talking about police organizations as if they are^1 autonomous entities responsible for these actions? These organizations do not dictate policy^1 ; politicians do. The casualties of the war on drugs is on the US congress and the administration, not glorified cops in suits. These organizations do^1 what politicians tell them to do.
^1 : Yes, I realize there are rogue organizations like the NSA at work, but this only illustrates the problem further. Can we at least *pretend* that these rogue, autonomous organizations are something out of the ordinary, a problem that we ought to fix, organizations that ought to follow the will of the people through the law enacted by our elected leaders? Stating that "the FBI made the world more dangerous" only serves to normalize this abnormal state of affairs.
TL;DR: don't shoot the messenger. Hold your elected representatives responsible instead.

Yeah, well, but there's a difference between designing a distributed system and designing one that *relies* on massive amounts of computational power being spent. [This article]( for example, quotes the bitcoin networks' power expenditure to be a little over what an ordinary US hydroelectric park produces.
If bitcoin ever goes mainstream and more than &lt;1% of the world population starts using it, I dare not guess how much power we'll spend. Enough to light up several small countries, no doubt.

[This]( is the relevant article you're looking for. Clients that doesn't download the block chain seem to be called "thin" (as opposed to "thick") clients.
In short, when you don't download the block chain but instead have someone else do it for you, you place your trust in them. If (and admittedly this is a big if) the author of your thin client is malicious, he/she could lie to you about the block history, causing all sorts of nasty surprises.
The Bitcoin transaction history is only as secure as the proportion of nodes running thick clients. Were we all to place our trust in 3rd parties, (i.e. authors of thin clients) they'd be the one deciding which transactions happens.
@_date: 2013-08-24 19:36:31
The Bitcoin protocol includes algorithms to adjust what counts as a valid block. They look at the most recent history of the block chain and increases the difficulty (making bitcoin harder to find) if they're found too frequently, and lowers the difficulty (making it easier) if not enough blocks are found.
I believe the protocol tries to maintain an average of one block found every ten minutes, and this is why we can confidently specify the date when bitcoins "runs out", i.e. no more coins are mined.
@_date: 2013-10-18 12:37:09
This is dumb. Childish, even. Please don't use Wikipedia as your own personal soap box to promote bitcoin, or anything else for that matter.
As OP points out, pretty much *every* currency is used to deal illegal goods. Pointing that out in every article on currency is unnecessary.
If you absolutely feel a need to edit Wikipedia, argue on the bitcoin talk page to remove the superfluous paragraph on bitcoin and drugs instead.

If "being Esperanto" means "being a fully functional, global language that is not widely used anywhere", I'd say bitcoin *already is* the currency equivalent to Esperanto.
In language metaphors, I'd hope bitcoin to become something more akin to French -- a widely known (if not widely spoken) language that you at some places, sometimes, make yourself understood using.
Making bitcoin (or any future cryptocurrency) the currency equivalence of English, (spoken everywhere, if not always natively) probably won't happen in my lifetime. :-/

Frankly, I wouldn't mind attempted regulation or an outright ban of bitcoin. In fact, I'd welcome it!
The bitcoin experiment is not *only* about performing stuff like distributed transactions, generating currency at a steady rate and stuff like that -- it is also about finding out how resilient such a cryptocurrency can be when opposed by the strongest entities there are, governments and banks.
I think it will be hard to truly claim bitcoin a "success" until it has withstood such a test -- continued exchange of goods and services for bitcoin *even* when confronted with governments and central banks trying to impose their restrictions.

Bitcoins are tied to addresses and their private keys. If nobody controls an address (i.e. controls the private key), the coins associated with it can't be used.
For all intents and purposes, they're lost.
Since this happens all the time, (hard disk drives go bad, computers crash, phones don't wake up) the amount of bitcoin in circulation will eventually dwindle. Note that all this does in practice is drive up the price of the remaining coins, since we can subdivide coins down to ridiculously small pieces. In ten years, we might as well be dealing in "satoshis" rather than millibitcoin for small purchases.

@_date: 2013-10-03 07:44:58
There's hardly need for speculation -- the bitcoin transaction logs are open for all, just follow the money and see where it leads. If a substantial amount of what passed through Silk Road's coffers leads to an address with little-to-no activity on it (i.e. a savings account) then yes, it might be a private sack of coins possibly belonging to Dread Pirate Roberts himself.
If such a pattern *don't* exist in the transaction logs, well... then there is no such treasure chest.

IANAL, but I'm not sure you'd want to go down that road. If we start treating bitcoin as the messaging protocol that it is instead of something that has tangible value, I'd argue that terms like "stealing" bitcoin would lose its meaning -- after all, you're merely sending a transaction message signed with a private key someone else generated.
If such a message would be protected under the 1st amendment, then by all intents and purposes bitcoin "belongs" to whoever holds the private key, regardless if it was acquired by legal means or not.

You don't "connect your account to reddit" per se, you send bitcoins to an address controlled by a bot. As with any bitcoin transaction, once it's done it's done -- there's no built-in chargeback mechanism.
To get the bitcoins back, (should you want it) you'll have to trust the bot to give it back. [Canso]( link explains how it works.

I don't think there's any way around that, frankly. Bitcoin *is designed* to be impervious to tampering and to let individuals stay in control of their money, *of course* it's going to make enemies!
Much like "piracy" (copyright infringement that is, not the murdering-and-stealing activity) I wouldn't be surprised to see bitcoin outlawed in a couple of years time. If we thought the media industry was cracking down hard on e.g. bittorrent users, we've seen nothing yet.
The Pirate Bay lads got years in prison and multi-million dollar fines for breaking the content delivery monopoly. (Assault &amp; batter someone and you'll get away with less) Think the financial institutions won't play ball to the same extent? If bitcoin becomes a large mainstream success and these players can't make it work for them, we are going to see some seriously draconic laws. Fines? Certainly. Hard prison time? Likely. Death sentences? Who knows...
@_date: 2013-04-17 13:49:32
CS guy here,
I'd just like to clarify something: while there are plenty of clever mechanisms in the bitcoin protocol, (the blockchain for example) the cryptography is not one of them. The *use and properties* (if not the exact details) of SHA-2 are well-known to any CS undergrad, to the point where *not* using it (or some other hash function) is gross negligence in a lot of applications.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:20:21


Right. It's capped at 21 millions or whatever, currently about 11 millions have been mined.


The value towards the USD, I assume? OK.


I'm not an economist, but that makes sense to me. :)


All of the above, I guess. Bitcoin has always attracted a number of speculators, (like any goods I guess) and it's pretty safe to say that there are plenty of people trying to get onto the gravy train in hopes of cashing out big some time in the future.
However, note that the value of one bitcoin will also always be exactly one bitcoin. Speculation is not its *only* use, from what I'm reading more and more businesses are starting to accept bitcoin in exchange for goods &amp; services i.e. a "real" or "legitimate" use. Of course, this also drives demand, pushing the prices up.
@_date: 2013-05-29 06:38:16
People *do* lose their coins however. I think it's pretty safe to call bitcoin "eventually deflationary".

The [Bitcoin FAQ]( is a good place to start reading, in particular [section 1.2, "How Can I Get Bitcoin"](

A central problem in any sort of distributed computing is the response times between nodes. Put bluntly, these algorithms are *slow*! They have to be, or else they wouldn't work "good enough".
For some distributed applications such as bittorrent and bitcoin, latency doesn't really matter because throughput (file sharing) or correctness (bitcoin) is all you want anyway.
Large sites such as facebook, reddit, etc (where speed matters) deals with this inherent slowness by accepting a little incorrectness. (Nobody cares about status updates) If you're a facebook user, I'm sure you've noticed sometimes how you can post something, immediately delete/edit it, and the world is none the wiser because your original post never propagated to the rest of the cluster.
Given that "real" brokers are going in the opposite direction (centralizing their servers as close as they can to the exchange) just to shave off a couple of microseconds, a distributed exchange is likely a bad idea.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:21:26

@_date: 2013-10-07 13:30:28
From my understanding of how the Silk Road worked, the admin(s) didn't sell stuff directly -- they provided a place where sellers and buyers could meet, and charged for it. Hardly different than, say, eBay or The Pirate Bay.
Edit: In the same vein, USPS is likely the largest drug distributor in the United States. That doesn't mean we let the police raid the USPS offices, since they're merely providing a service that is used for legal and illegal stuff alike.
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:11:27
If you're not looking to involve third parties, it's pretty similar to selling your wares for cash:
* List your stuff along with the price in BTC,
* Post your BTC address,
* Tell your clients to 1) send bitcoins, and 2) e-mail you the physical address for delivery.
That's the bare bones. From that point on, you can begin to improve the user experience. :)

Have you tried eBay? There seems to be people willing to sell bitcoins over eBay/PayPal, provided you have a good enough rating and/or is "PayPal-verified" or whatnot.
@_date: 2013-09-06 06:24:24
Basically, they're charging premium for the extra risk they take. If a customer buys their bitcoin using Paypal and then files a claim to get the money back, it's extremely likely they'll succeed and the seller loses out big.
Charging extra from the honest buyers helps offset the loss from the dishonest ones.
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:53:07
Personally, I wouldn't worry too much about it. If/when thin clients starts to become a legitimate threat, I reckon there'll be a PSA about it. From a "health of bitcoin" perspective, it's far more important that you use *a* bitcoin client rather than *which* one.
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:04:58
I'm thinking out loud here, but this is probably what I would do if I 1) were a small one-man business, and 2) trying to get started selling stuff for bitcoins with a minimum of hassle.
* List the stuff I'm selling, specifying prices in both your currency of choice + the equivalent in bitcoin.
* Start telling people that buying my stuff with bitcoins is a two-step process: sending bitcoin to my address, and an e-mail to me telling me what they bought, from what bitcoin address, and physical delivery address.
As I receive orders over e-mail, I'd cross-check the amount and sender address with what's in my bitcoin client, and ship stuff when the match. I'd probably have a dedicated work laptop in my office that runs stuff like accounting/libreoffice + bitcoin client + inventory list.
I'm a software engineer though, so eventually I'd start to look into things like automatically converting the dollar/euro/whatever price to the mtgox current price, displaying QR-codes on my website, automatic mails sent to my e-mail etc. But for starters, I'd imagine that the above would get me up and running with a minimum of hassle.
@_date: 2013-04-27 09:02:31
Unlike banks (that pay you interest) I think it's reasonable to assume they're not investing/gambling with your bitcoin, instead they just store it. That would make them immune to sudden bankruptcy and loss of customer's funds.

Honestly, I shrug it off. I explain to them that I don't care about the value of bitcoin vs other currencies, for the following reasons:
* I'm a decently paid software engineer in arguably the largest nanny state in the world, Norway. I'm neither poor nor particularly rich, and this won't change whether bitcoin is a fad, bubble, both or neither.
* I'm schooled as a computing scientist. This means cool math, algorithms and technology turns me on. Bitcoin, being a distributed, (mm, go on baby) peer-to-peer (oooh just like that) protocol featuring strong crypto (mmm) gives me massive brain-boners.
Whether bitcoin survives as a currency or not, the concept of keeping a safe, distributed transaction list among untrusted nodes is a novel concept that AFAIK has never been tried on this scale before. To me, that's bitcoin's true worth -- the solid science behind it that, hit or miss as a currency, is going to teach us nerds something.

Of course, if you're instead looking to play a part in the bitcoin experiment, (and make no mistake, it *is* an experiment) by all means, feel free to join in. Bitcoin has got massive hurdles to clear before it is commonly accepted as an alternative currency in everyday use, and about the only way we can test that hypothesis is to use it on an increasingly larger scale.
