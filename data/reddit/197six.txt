It's growing. People are getting interested for the wrong reasons but it's interest all the same.

I'm in South Africa. Local limits are tiny. Use an app from Luno.com. They are very good and very reliable. Not sure where you are so minimums may be different.

In case you aren't trolling. You can't. Men did land on the moon but you can't see the flag or the remains of the landers. It's over 230 000 miles from Earth.  Try see a flag 100 miles away from you with a telescope you buy in a shop and let me know how you get on.  You will need one with a mirror that is about 650ft in diameter. The largest earth based telescope currently is about (or soon to be) 30m I think.

Is it though? I buy a small amount (USD30) every month, irrespective of the price. I'm just increasing my BTC holdings, not trying to make money by buying and selling.

So here is the thing. This bloke is driving a Lambo he obviously bought with crypto profits... which means he has not HODLed right? Right?
Just asking, my 0.75BTC won't buy me a lambo for a while.

I'm not really dwelling on it. It taught me a lesson. I have some modest accumulations of other assets now, crypto and otherwise and am a lot more sensible about those.

Sigh, I had more than 50, less than 100. Early days, mined them. Forgot about them, formatted disk. Now... fractions of 1. More sighs.

Should have said "Formatted and reused... " Those bits and bytes are long overwritten.
