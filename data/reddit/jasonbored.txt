Sadly you pretty much nailed it Milly. Im all for all of the bitcoin supporters, and no doubt some of the more cringe/fringe guys do appear to be pro bitcoin. But when a guy like Jerry Brito is testifying at a senate and state level hearing, giving bitcoin the adult voice it needs.. And then on the other hand you have Bruce talking about how funny it would be to hire an actor to dress up like a military official and sit in a picture with the bitcoin company execs on that island and circulate the picture online to poke fun at trolls or tinfoilers.. it's like wow - priorities.

has done a great deal of advocacy for bitcoin, has given thoughtful and intelligent insight on bitcoin/blockchain tech, and has gone out of his way to work tirelessly in settting up Coincenter. He's an academic with impeccable credentials (from my alma mater of GMU might I ad) who is very obviously doing a lot for bitcoin. Why on God's green earth would you make childish accusations on social media, Bruce? For the record Bruce Fenton also has appeared to be a very pro-bitcoin supporter - and I'm aware of his background in finance, yet I'm not seeing how he's qualified to undercut Jerry's efforts by any measure, standard or credential. 
Keep up the good work Jerry and all the folks at Coincenter. Some people just like to hear the sound of their own voice.

Yeah I *really* doubt this. Could be the spooks themselves trying to cause a distraction from the Equation Group reveal by Kapersky. I mean look at the comically bad English - it's something like how a Bond villian would speak. And most importantly, anyone with the resources or know how to hack an NSA hacking squad would not be running some auction on the blockchain - that shit would be for sale to a foreign government, privately - if at all. 
If indeed this is a true "hack" - then could be the attackers got lucky in some revenge hack and hit a machine that had more data on it then it should have. 
The whole thing sounds weird.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:46:46
Oh yeah. No amount of tumbling will be able to obfuscate. Once those BTC hit an exchange account (which is verified - or not, but keeps logs) - they're fucked. I know this entire situation is unfortunate for Bitfinex, but it doesn't mean the hacker is going to be chilling in Belize sipping mojitos and screwing scantily clad women for the rest of his life. Let's be real.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:42:48


You can't. The thief can't. Things have changed. I wouldn't want to be in his shoes right now. Although it sounds silly - the hacker should consider that other thread about bargaining with Finex about returning a portion of the BTC in exchange for some kind of guarantee of non prosecution or something like that. Dunno how that would be structured - but it would be possibly the *only* option they will have. This is if Bitfinex even plays ball, and the hacker understands that they will be tracked down, even if they tumble the fuck out of chunks of the BTC methodically, sell $1,000 at a time over dozens of different localbitcoin accounts and be patient for months(years). Won't happen.
Dear hacker: strike a deal with Bitfinex and hope they go for a *"ok, you keep 25% as "bug bounty" - and give the rest back."*
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:33:11
More the irresponsible TBH. Something is fishy about this (as has been in the case in almost, *if not every* exchange hack in the last 5 years). I'm not qualified to get into the technicals of it, but a few things don't add up (they never do) to common sense.
Of course there is a difference between DNMs and Exchanges - and in general the exchanges are not guaranteed to be shut down/pull exit scams (all DNM's have been, will be. Period). But the greed and "full proof planning" of just 1 or 2 individuals who are privy to knowledge/information about the inner workings can wreak havoc. 
I don't believe a hacker simply found his way in, discovered that that so much BTC was up for the taking (considering how up till now we were led to believe Finex was insured and that 2-3 multisig was implemented so that a catastrophe like this couldn't happen. The hacker(s) were seemingly not pushed by this - meaning they could very well have possessed knowledge to the contrary.
On the bright side - this isn't Gox, and the days of Gox are way behind us. Many exchanges, many options, and no months of warning signs that shit was amiss. This is not going to set bitcoin back "years" or even "months" as some have speculated. Bitcoin is one resilient motherfucker.. this will pass. 
And as for the hacker(s) - they're not as lucky as one would think. Blacklisting ain't going to happen, **way too controversial**. But you can believe in addition to Finex, other exchanges, law enforcement, forensic investigators Finex will *have* to bring in to triage this, and even your amateur blockchain detectives are going to be watching. The hacker(s) aren't going to run off with $80m in fiat and sit on a beach. If they aren't stupid, and market indicators show an unsual downward price movement - someone who know shorted the living fuck out of BTC. Can't do that without a verified account on an exchange (even BTC-E has been known to play ball when it comes to keeping an eye out for stolen BTC). I would **not** want to be in the position of the hacker at this moment - their troubles are just about to begin.
@_date: 2016-08-11 22:19:35
I second this. First I'm hearing of it. That would be a serious deal if the case. If not, then whoever ran the "giveaway" obviously awarded themselves. Why? And why send money to the eater addy? Because they're laundering money and consider the dead coins a small price to pay. Maybe plausible deniability? Who knows. Maybe they have stolen or illicit proceeds Btc from something else and they thought this was a clever way to wash their money. 
If the btc that went to the eater address came from a known and confirmed address that held stolen bfx btc, then it's a *slightly* different story.
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:38:14
That's odd, I'm almost positive that only has to do with cash transactions ~10k. Wires are bank to bank, hence there's a full paper trail, hence it shouldn't trigger anything. Even small businesses (such as a gas station) wire $50k+ *daily* and I've never heard of a wire getting stopped or put in limbo unless there's an error on the senders/receivers details.

Interesting, I moved around half that for about $10 or so from one wallet to another (just housekeeping). 
You might not be the best to ask, but moving funds from legacy to a segwit wallet should be painless, yes? By any chance are you using a Trezor? The Trezor interface shows legacy vs segwit. No problem if you don't know off the top of your head.

It doesn't hurt and I didn't mean to sound like a dick. If you're asking in good faith and are relatively new to crypto, I'd venture because right now is a very volatile and watershed moment for cryptocurrencies and bitcoin. It has truly gone viral and everyone from teenagers with allowance to world leaders are captivated and mesmerized by the sheer disruption.
This is not a price sub, so I'll reserve my thoughts, but in general you will see these fluctuations in the space for some time to come. Nature of the beast.
That said, "bitcoin cash" is an alt coin. I am someone who firmly believes that the block size limit must be increased and no good will come of ignoring the very real scaling issue, but "bitcoin cash" is not bitcoin and should be thought of as another alt.
Hope that helps.

Um yeah, I do. People steal money all the time. Especially cash. Bitcoin is the digital equivalent. And no.. the US Govt is not in the business of stealing bitcoin because, hell, *here's* a conspiracy theory: the blockchain is the most accurate "paper trail" of money ever (can't be forged or hidden).. therefore it makes tracking transactions extremely beneficial.

*What?* Luke, you're obviously a far more intelligent person then I am - which is why I'm confused if you're analogy is so above my head that I didn't understand it, or your logic is genuinely so flawed that it's awkward to respond to.
What you're saying doesn't make any sense. If coblee tried to rename Litecoin to Bitcoin - he'd be met with amusement and people checking their calendars for April 1st. This is totally, totally different. Are you suggesting that bitcoin.org (a should-be neutral site pertaining to Bitcoin) posting a "policy" that is plain old *picking sides* with it's language and posture is akin to, linuxfoundation.org posting a "policy" that certain distros have no place?
Let's be real here - *both* 'sides' of this BSI debate have been thoroughly highjacked and tainted with the reek of self serving interests. Apple reserves the right to post it's policy that it will not allow devices running Android to call themselves iPhones. But bitcoin.org is not Apple, and bitcoin xt is not Google. Apple !=Google and never can, just as Bitcoin != Litecoin and never can. Your analogy is removed from the reality of what's going on and I find it hard to believe you don't have a grasp of what is.
Bitcoin.org should be neutral and not take such a bizarre stance. It can, but it probably shouldn't. I say lets see where the chips fall, and **that** will be the official bitcoin blockchain. 
Edit: Forgot to say that Litecoin is an alt. If xt is adopted by a majority, it will not be an alt-coin - unless bitcoin as we know it today is an alt-coin as well.. considering there has been a fork in the past.

I'm well aware of what the CIA does - and it's a magnificent stretch of the imagination to assume it has any interest in sabotaging bitcoin.

Of course not. But calling him/them/it "wrong" is unncessarily arrogant.

No - that reveals an insecurity and arrogance that's rather childish. If one doesn't like a certain band's choice of sound for an album, is the artist wrong? There is no such thing as wrong for a content creator unless they do something that goes against fact. Peter Todd is not qualified to make that declaration.

And why should you? Clearly Gavin is a CIA plant, working for some nefarious agenda to harm bitcoin in the long (and short) run. This whole working on bitcoin literally since almost the beginning w/Satoshi (as a volunteer), and then later the Bitcoin Foundation, and now @ MIT is clearly a front for the diabolical political crypto political mastermind who's in the pocket of VC backed bitcoin service providers and their PR machinery. Literally the most selfish and Machiavellian geek in history.
Now really, are you serious? Let there be no mistake that even though there is *probably* no conflict of interest from some of the core devs opposing the BSI, it's sure looking like there might be. And without naming names - there is a, as someone else coined the term, "cryptopolitician" who's really behaving questionably in public forums.. who clearly has a conflict of interest. I know, "these views were old" - but.. so? Doesn't mean a conflict of interest can't solidify these views and cause people to dig their heels in. In fact, there's a likely chance that might well be the case, even if subconsciously. People do not take passionate positions in a vaccum. Where there's smoke.. you know?
I think this Gavin-bashing is frankly uncalled for and it's insulting to ridicule his work w/bitcoin.

Upvoting this. I'm actually curious since I've heard conflicting info on this. Someone once told me that you can absolutely have anything over $5k confiscated from you if pulled over and YOUR have to prove the source of the funds and its a gigantic hassle and all kinds of bullshit. Another person countered that absolutely can not happen and a cop can't just take your money, you can politely tell them it's none of their fucking business. I'm not a lawyer - anyone know the exact law? Is this state by state or federal?
Edit: a family friend owns a chain of gas stations and has routinely driven around with over $30k in cash and made deposits to their merchant account at a bank and says they've never had an issue - yet they've also never been pulled over while transporting the money. (Cash accumulated from the convenience store and repair garage over a weekend, 4 gas stations, easily upwards of 20-30K)

It's another for a so called journalist and publication to call my claims "too good to be true" and say Google "denied it all". That is utter bullshit. 
I posted a challenge below, and I hope the author of this article or the publication itself has the balls to come out and own up. If they can get Google to say Sridhar did not say **"we are working in the payments team to figure out how to incorporate bitcoin into our plans"** I will give 10 Bitcoins to the author, and 10 bitcoins to the TheNextWeb. Once they accept this challenge, I have no problem having hold the 20 BTC as escrow and even take a commission for his services.
IF they can not get Google say those emails are fake (or better yet admit they are real like they did to BizJournal), then all I ask for them is an apology and retraction to the part calling it "*too good to be true*", since I'm not a liar and I take immeasurable offense to that.
TheNextWeb and the esteemed author of that article have avoided my efforts to contact them politely, and have avoided well known tech bloggers who have seen the emails and authenticated them as well. Well then, is **20 BTC enough to get them to respond?**
Please up-vote this for visibility. I want TheNextWeb and Emil Protalinski to see this since they're having trouble seeing tweets, emails, Google+ posts and every other effort for me to politely reach out.

BUT, 1 instance of violation will invariably lead to 2 which will lead to 3 which will lead to 4 and so on. Nobody said anything about throwing out the entire system. 
Like I said in my other post - if the police are tasked to keep you safe in your neighborhood, they should be able to do so by sitting their fat asses in their cruisers parked on the curb. Our tax dollars pay their salaries - so they should do what us, their mandate, elect the our representative legislators set forth as law. They should **not** have any right to go door to door and demand everyone keep their front doors unlocked, and then also call the front-door-lock-manufacturers and order them to hand over duplicate keys to everyones front door. Believe me, that will be a slippery slope and it will be the beginning of the end. Yet somehow - that sounds absurd because I was giving an example of police/homes/front door locks, right?

I agree it's a fair point, thats why I have put a poll at the top of this page as well, which can not be manipulated. 
Additionally - a friendly reminder to everyone who submitted a video - everyone knew the rules before they entered the contest. By entering, one acknowledged something to the affect of "here is the contest, here are the rules, here is my submission." If anyone was uncomfortable with the process, they could have simply opted out of submitting a video.. simple. Also, everyone who donated (publicly and privately) knew the rules going in, otherwise they wouldn't have donated money.
My concern: I know every single contestant here has worked very hard, and I know that for a fact. Seemingly brand new accounts should post from their real accounts (if they have one), otherwise their legitimacy are subjected to be seen as "shill accounts".
What I take great offense to is a 0 day account suggesting "the OP is in on some nefarious scam" or something. That's insulting and ludicrous.

In the earlier response, I received a pretty run-of-the-mill "Thanks for your suggestion" type of email. In today's response they mention how "..for business reasons we can't comment on any future business partnerships.."
Certainly there's a shift in tone. Could be theyre getting more such emails so they've come up with a cookie-cutter reply to all bitcoin inquiries.. or could be minor clue as to their mindset ("*future business partnerships*")?
Anybody else send an email to good old Jeff Bezos? Would be interested in seeing the responses.

That's ridiculous. Circle is not in the business of making "shady stuff" convenient and they're AML/KYC policies are more then adequate. Circle is extremely convenient, seamless and slick. As for large amounts - they're more then willing to raise limits and such. I've personally never has a single problem with them and find them to be rock solid.

Hilarious. It's always amusing to see "Comments Disabled" because that's just a fancy-shmancy synonym for "We don't want to get humiliated and/or verbally ass-raped by what people are sure to speak their mind about"
@_date: 2014-09-06 13:45:16
every "single bitcoin in the world" does not exist yet - so no, they can't. And if they were to start buying "every single bitcoin" they could get their hands on (the markets, private sellers, localbitcoins (lol)), not only would they not be able to get "all the bitcoins" because some people would refuse to sell (and some have been abandoned). 
Additionally, if Apple started buying up as much bitcoin as is possible, you can believe it will dramatically increase the price/hype/news and create a bubble the likes of which we haven't seen. Prices would drive up (as is the way order books work, no?) and other competing buyers would want in on the action and keep buying.
And then beyond that, what would they do? Try to buy every single bitcoin that was newly mined?
Often times I just shrug off ridiculous posts.. but I couldn't help myself with this one. There is a total break down of logic and common sense in your thinking.

Someone with 3000BTC almost certainly did not get involved with any notion of becoming a millionaire (they'd have no way of knowing what would come of this whole *thing* back then). If they've kept their btc through all the ups&amp;downs, positive/negative publicity and multitude of other opportunities to "cash out and live the high life" they've been around the blockchain (hehe) long enough to know that what they have is *worth* way more then it currently is. Additionally, they most likely wouldn't do it all @ once. 
We've no idea why they'd move their coins.. but could be just to... move their coins. Security? Breaking their btc up into smaller incremments? For fun? Could be a number of factors and drivers.
Unlikely after years of not trading/touching a single btc they woke up this morning and thought "Alright, cmon baby big money, big money!" and mozy on over to Bitstamp. Localbitcoins would seem like the more logical move. (**j/k**)

Well the closest we got was some mention of bitcoin and "the tor network" in episode 3 of this last season of House of Cards. Although lots of TV shows have started making BTC references (Simpsons, Family Guy, Silicon Valley, CSI, Justified, etc). The irony is that Breaking Bad never did.. and well, no spoilers here.. but I feel had BTC been in the picture, the debacle in the desert that spiraled out of control wouldn't have occured. 
Edit: Gotta remember, by the time episodes hit the airwaves, theres a good 6 months (or more) from when they were written to when they're on your screen. I imagine we'll be seeing a fuckton more BTC mentions in mainstream television in the coming days/weeks/months.

My pleasure. I guess the only advice I would have is that they are "Zero-Knowledge", meaning that they **do not** hold your private keys, and it would be **impossible** for them or anyone even literally holding a gun to their heads to view your data. 
The only caveat: they are not open source (*yet*). Meaning we have to take their word for that. However, they've developed Crypton (a zero-knowledge framework) and Crypton is what "Encryptr" (a sister product of SpiderOak) is built on - and that is fully open source.

That's right, the VC's who've poured tens of millions of dollars into building out bitcoin infrastructure (most of which is not even KNOWN to to the public yet due to NDA's) are giving bags-of-fucks about the price today. These people think long term, dream big, and more or less use the Internet as a reference point for how truly innovative technology can change the world. I could replace the OP's title with *Internet* instead of *bitcoins* and it would have sounded about right.... in 1994.

Thank you man. I tried as best as I could dude to keep it as fair. Aside from running a 3rd party poll or bitcointalk poll (all which were suggested by contestants to me privately).. I don't know how else I could have accommodated everyone to keep everyone happy. I even asked if he could provide me stats from Vimeo, which he immediately did and also showed me Charlie Shrems tweets and that blog, which I am assuming brought some visibility to the video. I'm hoping everyone played fair, and while I'm not naive and know that everyone at some point probably pulled some attempts to "win at all costs".. I sincerely hope they live with their conscience. At the end of the day I got nothing out of this, and just wanted a way to organize a united stand to Apple's fuckery. Everyone (myself included) donated under the assumption that the contestants will play *relatively fair* enough.
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:46:14
Yup - exactly what I was thinking. And to take it a step further, if Lawsky was planning on the upcoming revised regulations to be a pile of shit like the first iteration, it would do him/his office **no favors** by releasing all the comments. Majority of the submitted comments are pro Bitcoin, and then you have WU and Amazon etc whining. If the coming regulations were bound to have major blowback, releasing all the comments (which they said they would take into consideration) wouldn't make a lot of sense.

Congress can force whatever the hell they want. First of all I honestly think sanity would prevail and that will **not** happen. Google and Apple are not exactly neighborhood lemonade stands. They've got money, political clout, a gazillion loyalists (consumers), and power. *IF* they're for real about this new-found love for right-to-privacy and encryption, they will not .. to put it crudely..drop their pants and bend over. Apple+Google might not have the guns or law-making powers of the Govt, but they will not allow themselves to get boxed into a corner. They have to generate profits, and looking like little bitches will hurt their bottom line. 
And IF J. Edgar Hoover Junior's anti-encryption crusade somehow pans out in his favor, well then - TrueCrypt. Or PGP. Or SpiderOak. etc. etc. **etc**.

I've never been to those subs.. so you're probably right. I wouldn't honestly know.
As for "circle jerking 24/7" there is a fundamental flaw in that. Take for example - it's a subreddit for bitcoin, right? So logic would have it that proponents or supporters or people who have some interest in the topic would be the majority. The audience at a U2 concert would predominantly be filled with fans of the band. Would they be U2 circle-jerks? And to that end - if someone went to a U2 concert and held up a sign after every song (or booooed) that said "Fuck U2!".. it would seem extremely bizarre given the setting, no?
There are some very intelligent people in this subreddit who are bitcoin proponents, as are there some very intelligent people who think bitcoin is not the innovative technology it's being touted as - yet they keep the discourse somewhat respectful, logical and mature. 
Bottom line - you are going to find enthusiasts about XYZ in a community called "XYZ". Someone "booing" nonstop is an outlier, and clearly has something off about them. Naturally, after enough boo-ing.. their motives would be looked at questionably. 
I tend to be doubtful majority of the naysayers are "paid" to troll. I'm sure some are? Who really gives a shit TBH. The more likely scenario is that they're either disturbed, immature or bitter. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:50:56

@_date: 2014-01-24 18:14:12
That is, IMHO probably 99% what happened. But now, Google has taken a different stance and admitted those emails did in fact happen. After that they can say their "we are currently not xyz" to their hearts content. They are a large company, they are a public company with investors, and they are a leading tech giant. They don't spill secrets via slip-ups in email exchanges with redditors. So they have to keep a consistent "plead the 5th" approach to their exact plans and timeline, but unless Gundotra, Sridhar, and Ariel Bardin (and/or me) are all liars.. something slipped. And that's never going to change.
@_date: 2014-12-19 14:59:47
Welllll... while I agree that the most probable explanation is that they're trolls trying to sway public opinion or push price down, I honestly do think there's a third sub-category in there that can't be ignored.
Remember Reality4U? Or Witcoins? Or some of the other "Hall of Famers"? Those two (for example) never tried to pump some product/coin of their own and didn't seem to be traders shorting. They **never** (or rarely) posted in the trading sub. They actively spent the entire day/night sputtering negative shit, often time with a ferociousness that defied logic. Sometimes their typing style changed. What could be an incentive for a sane human being to spend their every waking minute in screaming anti-bitcoin rants? If they truly "hated" bitcoin, they'd come in here for a bit and lob some insults at the technology, it's users or this subreddit and then crawl back to wherever they emerged from. But dedicating every single comment posted on Reddit to *hating* on bitcoin like it's their job? Unless it is their job..
@_date: 2014-05-13 00:35:20
You know what? Fuck these down-vote bots. I'm going to up-vote everything I remotely suspect of being unfairly down-voted by the hater-brigade.

Nic Weaver is a very smart guy, but he has always been a no-coiner going back years. And he's been wrong. It's just not his thing, which is fine. He does spend quite a bit of time on Twitter musing about btc though. Not as obsessive as Stolfi.

Might wanna throw in *powerful* in their as well. Right now the wealthy elite of the world are by and large the dinosaurs (like that twat from the Lawsky speech/discussion yesterday who said he "had to wire his daughter $300 using The Paypal and entered the wrong phone number") of a slow dying breed. When bitcoin eventually goes the way of all major tech innovations (telephone,television,personal computer,Internet,mobile phones, social media etc), the more tech savvy will be the new wealthy. And wealth goes hand in hand with power. It will be people who understand how to send btc to a QR code who are calling the shots - not the outdated "disco era" farts who couldn't figure out how to "send a wire through The Paypal". 
Imagine the possibilities with smarter people in positions of wealth/power. The world will be run much, much differently.
*This is assuming bitcoin heads to it's logical trajectory. The flip side is that it heads nowhere - but barring any fatal flaw in the protocol that's very unlikely.
@_date: 2014-06-03 04:53:25
It's certainly the most popular. Let's face it they're not talking about Dogecoin. Apple could have worded it the other way and reinforced their previous stance. The writing is on the wall here.

Am I the only one who thinks that we're seeing/going to see a barrage of manufactured claims? Im not saying OP did that - but all it would take would be a bunch of BTC you already own, and then "hack" your own account via tor and send the BTC through a mixer to an address you control. Then post the transactions. Then be pissed and/or sad and hope Blockchain "makes it right" or that people feel bad for you and send you btc.
I'm almost positive I saw one post a few days ago that was definitely this. And the guy played it brilliantly with the sympathy card sprinkled here and there. While the entire thread were people playing Sherlock Holmes - nobody (except one poor soul who got downvoted into oblivion) questioned how we know this guy didnt "hack" himself. I think he posted an address too, requesting the hacker to return his btc. I didn't bother commenting but I do remember reading and thinking this dude is playing the thread like a fiddle - yet it must be frustrating because he only got a few bucks in goodwill changetip.

I was just thinking about this in the shower. A lot (if not all?) of the ways to obtain bitcoin (Coinbase, Circle etc) require an adult. Parents who otherwise might not even have known what bitcoin is will be sucked down this rabbit hole when their kid asks them to buy it for them to fund their Xbox account. The children will have btc ingrained into their heads, and adults will slowly coming  into the fold as merchant adoption expands and all that.
Really the impact of this can not be overstated. This isn't Dell or Overstock. This is a coup on Microsoft's part and a huge deal for bitcoin.

You know I can't help but agree with this. These guys are no doubt "true proponents" of bitcoin and believers. They get the technology. I think the amount of mockery they get is almost unfair. They're working their asses off (it seems) to do their part in taking bitcoin mainstream. This is not some pump&amp;dump or long-con or them jumping behind 50 new techs and seeing what sticks. They're firmly behind bitcoin.
Now - the fact that they have funny names, and were shown as rich kid buffoons in a movie, and don't have the oratory skills of Andreas is **not** a valid reason to heap horseshit onto their obvious hard work and efforts. 
No they're not our typical image of a "fuck the government! fuck the IRS!" libertarians, nor are they crypo-dev-tech-whizkids.. but so what? Give these guys a break. Believe me, they're **not** conspiring to push a fake ETF in hopes of making a few bucks from They're putting time, money, effort and resources into bitcoin. Hell - the proposed ETF is called *COIN* and not "WinkBit" or some shit. A little slack, please?

Very cool. Love it. At 16, you're really seeing a side of Apple that simply didn't exist once upon a time. Steve Jobs (despite being a polarizing figure), did at one point challenge people to think differently, to foster innovation, to embrace disruptive technology, to think outside the box and go against the status quo. In my POV, bitcoin falls into all of those categories.

I got [the same response yesterday]( which was much different then the [response I received in March]( 
I absolutely agree the "can't comment on future partnerships"  is a *wink wink nudge nudge*.
Several people have reported this same response come in, which means they've got a cookie-cutter/default response to these inquiries regarding bitcoin, and if they wanted to poo-poo the notion they'd outright imply it. IMHO they're definitely up to something. Amazon didn't get to where it is by being wreckless and leaky. Something's cooking.. I can smell it in the air.

Regardless, you speak sense.
FYI I've asked Forbes to press Google regarding the comments of those 3 executives and see if they themselves can shed any light on what they meant. I think that's the only real way to know what they meant.. by asking the guys themselves, right?

I've posted an edit regarding the end date. I could post a donation address if you want, although I don't know who a "trusted member" might be. I know that Nicolas Cary of Blockchain.info has pledged to donate half a btc, and the owner of BtcTrinkets.com has pledged anything from their current selection + free shipping.
The only issue I have with people donating before there are actually videos up is that what if nobody makes a video? Or, nobody decides a video "wins". I don't want to be holding anyones funds for no reason. So my idea is to  arrange the prize/payment part after actual videos are submitted.

There is no way to "pin" them to the top.. I can post each submission in the original post, but then it will become much harder to gauge which video "wins" this way. It's logistically better to have a separate post for each submission. However, I will edit the OP to reflect the total number of submissions so that everyone knows how many there are in total, thus knowing how many to view before making a choice.

There are several countries that have massive Muslim populations that have a thriving celebrity/pop culture and tech overload (think Dubai, India, etc). All you need is a telecom/wireless carrier, a pop singer/actor/actress (to endorse) and some traditional banking infrastructure (or maybe not), and many Muslims will run towards bitcoin. It solves a fundamental problem they have with interest technically being frowned upon in their faith (exception = your living conditions make it unavoidable - for example you're living in a country/state where there is no option but to engage in interest due to your job or education or limited access to 0%interest bank accounts). This is a very hot topic amongst Muslims in general, especially the educated, who have been trying to think of a workaround and find a clever way to be a part of a financial system that falls within the guidelines of their religion. All it will take will be a country like Dubai to make a huge push - and a 1/5th of the world's population will suddenly have found a perfect solution to a problem they've been tackling for centuries. The adoption would be staggering and not slow &amp; steady - it would be a huge hit.

That's what I was thinking. What if he's leaving to work in the bitcoin/digital currency space? Lord knows he certainly has lots of information he can bring to the table. Yes he's been dick-ish (lately), but that's not something that should be ruled out.
It's a bit premature to speculate he's going to work for JP Morgan or the like. Something tells me he wont - simply because he's been in the thick of whats happening in btc and he may be part of the "establishment", **but** he doesn't come across as a fool. Sneaky maybe, but not a fool. He seems like the kind of guy who'd jump which way the winds of change might blow.

Exactly. You nailed. If I wanted to, I could take the funds pledged and simply hire a professional to make one. I know several artists who do that for a living. The reason I'm not doing that and soliciting it as a "contest" from the community is that it has to come from the heart, it has to reflect passion. What's the point in hiring some guy who's not into bitcoin to make one just like any other gig?
The point is to get the best video made from *within* the bitcoin community, and then spread the video and make that baby go viral. The winner receives a prize (well now it's BTC + anything of their choosing from BtcTrinkets.com), yes, but IMHO the prize should be the icing, not the cake. So far we have pledged .5 BTC from Nic Cary, $40 from Peter_R, $5 from Limaguy_2 and something free from BtcTrinkets.com. I will also be adding to the final pot, and I'm sure other pledges will trickle in.
Again - the point is not the money, in my opinion. That's the prize, not the point.

I got an invite, and was even able to sign up. However, wanted to test it out to see if it was even operational, and tried logging in and had issues (I know the password was correct). Still, sent a "Password Reset" request. Nothing. No email. Waited half a day, again, no Password Reset email. Emailed support directly, no response. Emailed info no response. Emailed info and support, got a canned email a day later telling me to check my spam! And that "he personally sent another password-reset-emai to my email account" and to again, check... SPAM!
 I responded it wasn't in spam, and it has to do with Salesforce (the CRM they're using to send emails out..  I know this as I've worked in big brand Email Marketing deployment for 8 +years). The person, Tom Hennessy, thanked me for my interested in Circle and appreciated my suggestions. And told me to "be on the lookout for exciting new Circle products!".
FWIW forwarded this convoluted exchange to jallaire (for shits and giggles. and why not? CEO's should be on-top of these things especially during the initial phase of a company's launch.) No response, though (duh).

The USPS couldn't do much about e-mail. E-mail was way more efficient, pretty much free, and a reality check for the old guard. Traditional post still exists.. and in some cases provide a utility e-mail cant, but in the 'bigger picture', e-mail *did* blow right past it.

Well - I was with friends from out of town and it's not really my place to get into a verbal altercation with the retired Federal Reserve Chairman in a packed bar/restaurant while he's waiting on his wife.. would be in bad taste.

You make good points but I don't think he's succeeding at disrupting much. He's just a bitter, non creative troll. His only "point" is the price.. And even that is relative. Bitcoin is still in its infancy (price wise) due to supply and demand. And for some, it's appreciated x20 :) And for those who have bought and have held, they're smart - this is still early adoption. $800 will seem like peanuts eventually. Some of us have been around the block long enough to remember single digits. Volatility shouldn't phase anyone who understands how powerful and innovative this tech is.

This is a situation where both and have totally legitimate points of view. The tendency (and general consensus) is to revile everything about the guy and what went down - understood. People lost money, some a LOT, "Bitcoin" itself suffered a PR shitstorm worse then probably anything we've ever seen, and the whole uncertainty around what *really* happened has reached near Kennedy Assassination theory-dom. 
**But**, to play devil's advocate, without MtGox (and by default Karpy Karp).. bitcoin probably would not have reached critical mass in such short time. Therein, lies the paradox gentlemen.

It is their duty to fix these issues and make people whole. I agree. I also think that it's a known principle to NOT keep more then what you'd keep in your real wallet at any web based wallet. That too a **free service**.  People have been shouting this at the top of their lungs from day one.
I've never understood people who equate web based wallets or free services with commercial, insured banks with a profit model. A lot of the point of bitcoin is freedom from being babysat and there's a measure of small cost of that freedom: educating yourself on personal security.
You know how many Btc I lost at the nefarious Blockchain.infos free web based JavaScript wallet hosting service? 0.000000

Yep.. but it's pretty easy to see why. Articles and predictions like this scare them.. and that's a no brainer. I just dismiss their cynicism as something to be expected. Bitcoin has as much chance as going to $100k as it did going from $1 to to $100 and $100 to where it is today. I'd say, "pretty fucking possible".

No no, I totally see why you'd be cautious. I'm holding my horses too.. and I do think that Google was trying to gauge which way the wind blows before committing to BTC. Clearly there's a pro BTC sentiment in the US, and I'm certain they've got something lined up. I think it's more of an issue of hammering the legalities coupled with the marketing machinery. It all has to be in tight sync.
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:20:56
Could very well be. I think a company of Google's stature (and the roles of the individuals I corresponded on email) are way smarter then a mere mortal such as me, so "loose talk" is probably something they don't indulge in.. especially with strangers.

Good question actually. I'm sure that Google has enough clout that Apple wouldn't try to ban Google Wallet for allowing BTC transactions. They tried that with Maps and look at the backlash. They can bully companies like Coinbase or Blockchain.info.. but if Google makes a move, Apple's got to play ball (even though they are in a cold war)

Hmm. Interesting that they chose to say "future business partnerships". If it's a cookie-cutter response to all bitcoin related inquiries and they weren't even thinking about btc, I assume they aren't that blindly dumb to think of bitcoin as a partnership/company..
I'm not an expert on corporate speak/PR by any means, but it seems to be worded in a way that inadvertently gives a tidBit of a clue on what's cooking. Partnership? Coinbase? Bitpay? *just thinkin' outloud...*

Oh dude you wouldn't believe the half of it - yes, there are some people who spend literally upwards of 20+ hours a day (although by stylometric variance I can assume their accounts are being handled by more then a unique user) just posting negative comments about bitcoin. It defies logic.
You *sound* like someone who genuinely believes bitcoin will fail - and that's totally fine. I don't agree, but I respect your opinion and the way you phrase it. Fair enough. I could go into dozens of reasons I feel it won't/can't, and I can even give ya some btc to get you "into" it (if you want) to play around with it, but I'm not sure if that'll change your POV.
RE ulterior motives.. beats me. But if someone spends every single post on Reddit in just bashing bitcoin, it's either obsession or ulterior motive. It's not healthy discourse/disagreement by any definition. And yes - I do think some people invested a lot of money into bitcoin (not sure if its their entire life savings - that's crazy) for purely speculative purposes who have lost their shirt. But those people invested @ the peak of an artificially inflated price bubble. I know a lot more who bought btc not really knowing where it would go but thought it was a genius tech innovation (such as myself) when it was worth next to nothing and over the course of a few years it's appreciated in value.
Anyways - you sound like you a prime example of a sane human who has an opposite view. Believe me , you're rare.

Well Google has definitely been looking into ways to integrate bitcoin in some fashion or or the other. If some of you remember the whole leaked emails fiasco I stirred up ([this thread]( a few months ago...
Google immediately said they had "no current plans" - but the emails exchanges I had said totally different, and I think one of blogs/press finally got them to comment that the email interactions did in fact occur. (Buzzfeed maybe? I can't remember exactly).
Anyways, fast fwd to today. Vic Gundotra is no longer @ Google.. but the the SVP who heads up Google Wallet &amp; SVP of Payments still are..
I doubt I'm the best person to contact them. But if there's someone here who has the stature/eloquence/drive to want to reach out.. shoot me a PM me, I'll give you their contact info. Posting their emails addresses publicly probably isn't the best idea.

The way I see it, Buffett is looking at it wrong because of nothing more then a generational issue. The new overthrows the old.. and that's a fact of life.
Warren's (and those of his generation) probably don't spend as much time on Facebook, Youtube, Twitter etc as do people who are younger. 10 years ago had someone told Buffet about Facebook, I'm sure he'd have said something similar along the lines of "it's an effective way of staying in touch with people and all that..but so are good ol' fashioned phone calls. Are phone calls worth a lot?" He wouldn't get it because he can't possibly get it. He kinda sorta does, but he'll never get bitcoin because it's counter to more then 8 decades of his experience, success and habits.
Additionally, Buffet is notorious for being outspoken that he doesn't invest in things he doesn't understand.. so clearly he's speaking from his conservative POV. 
And here's what he (and Jamie Dimon etc) will never get. Paying a $40 wire fee, or paying 8% to Western Union for remittance, or being helpless about their personal wealth being devalued/inflated .. not so much of a problem for these guys. Bitcoin might not solve any problems for *them* (in fact, it probably *creates* problems for their vested interests).. but it certainly solves a shitload of problems for the rest of the world. And that's why he just won't get it.
edit: just re-watched.. the part where Buffet goes "it's a joke!" and adjusts his body language is smug, but also defensive. as if bitcoin can potentially throw a spanner in the works for him. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 23:34:57

That's a very fair POV, and I totally respect that. My POV is different, and  whenever I've dealt with corporate and software types in my career, I've taken to mean one of the bosses @ Google (Vic Gundotra) to CC the SVP in charge of Google Wallet and say he's "cc'ing him", who then in turn writes "we are working in the payments team to figure out how to incorporate bitcoin into our plans" who then CC's the VP of Payments, whom I have a series of emails back and forth it... my take away is somewhere between *investigating* and *releasing it*.
I genuinely take it to mean they're working on it. What "working on" means is semantics. But I can assure you "working on incorporating it" is definitely not "we are not working on incorporating it". Do you see where I'm coming from?
I respect what you're saying and I've posted most of the emails up. I've kept a few back out of respect for an exchange I had with one of them.
I think as a general rule, one can infer *something* is going on, right? Which is diametrically opposite to Amazon's "no". 
Overstock, Tigerdirect, Newegg, and even eBay &amp; Paypal have also had similar language in the past.. and well, let's just agree that it's up to the reader to see what those emails mean and in what context.
Fair enough?

This is not cool at all.. and borderline insulting. People have USD withdrawals *delayed*, now BTC withdrawal *delayed*... what in the hell is left?! I haven't touched Gox in months and don't have anything stuck but even I feel insulted. This is major fuckery. Karpeles has some serious 'splainin to do, and I'm afraid having Roger Ver make a video at gunpoint is not going to cut it this time.

Gambling (in its literal sense) with your BTC right now is not a great idea. There's almost certainly a very very good chance that the price of BTC will far exceed your purchase price. I would just hold it. In fact, pickup a bit more if possible. You'll thank me later.

Well - sidelines is better then being aggressively anti-btc, right? Vic Gundotra is not in the business of responding to Joe Blow via email regarding something they're actively working on a competitive product/service.

Really? I didn't think about that. Thanks for bringing to my attention. Any lawyer out there want to weigh in? How is it any different from giving a prize to, say, a band/singer for covering a song (while adding their own twist) and winning a raffle/contest? Or anyone making a collage/montage on Youtube? I think if anything was violating copyright (and fair use), Youtube would yank it first (or send a warning to the uploader). Now, Youtube being owned by Google... which is very btc friendly (and probably getting a kick out of seeing people pissed at Apple).. might not rigorously enforce this. Second, would me or any of the contestants be opening ourselves up to any legal challenges? I mean if Apple were to do that.. I think they'd be doing themselves PR suicide.. especially on the heels of this anti-competitive stunt with Blockchain. 
But I dunno. Good point. Anyone with any legal information feel free to post here or PM me. Also, I just thought of something. The prize's current value is it's value in BTC... so I dunno where that stands legally either. If re-tooling Jobs's ad and using his voice triggers Apple to demand all these videos be taken down "or else!", then they will REALLY be seen as pricks. I'm just a normal Joe, the same as all the people submitting videos.

You think he'll join JP Morgan? This guy is in the thick of it - he knows those dinosaurs are a dying breed. He's not going to join the board of  a financial "Blockbuster Video".

No, it's not clearly false. It's actually be been validated by Forbes, Bizjournal, Business Insider, Buzzfeed, Vice, Coindesk, The Daily Dot, and several high profile tech bloggers. **One** lonely article from "TheNextWeb" claims it was "too good to be true" and insinuated it was concocted out my ass/ I am a liar.
I've challenged that publication and it's author to either get a concrete statement from Google saying those emails did not say what I posted, or retract their article and remove "it was too good to be true". Oh, and I've also put 20 Bitcoins up as a wager.
I'm very, very curious and hopeful they come forward.. considering they are an iconic beacon of news in the technology world *rolls eyes*. They've since remained silent when every other media article has verified with Google that those emails are not fake. What Google's corporate speak of "we have no *current* plans" is semantics. Their Senior Vice President who heads up the Google Wallet division said they **"are working on incorporating it"**. 
Hope that clears up any confusion.

*supposed to protect. We pay taxes under that understanding. Violating a right to privacy is not protection it's intrusion. The police are supposed to protect you in  your neighborhood -that does not mean they can order the manufacturer of the lock on your front door to provide them with a master key. They can do their job sitting in their cruisers on the STREET. Not inside your home. And if they can't stop the bad guys from there then their inefficient and need better training or replaced with someone more competent.
Also let's not delude ourselves - majority of criminals make mistakes that get them caught (and should) in real world situations. Encryption does not hamper responsible law enforcement. Drug dealers, pedos and terrorists don't operate solely in the digital realm. At some point the kilos, children (horrible btw), and bombs are trafficked in the physical world. Nail them there.

That's a ridiculous notion. "Hitman hirer's get a free pass"? What is that in reference to? Ross Ulrbicht? That's completely dissimilar to this situation. BFL knowingly defrauded people out of millions of dollars, causing irreparable financial and emotional damage. BFL also was a company operating within the legal ambit, so they should be taken to task for their behavior. It's not about "jumping at the feds to save us". If you're operating within a framework then there are rules you signup for. You're comparing an underground unregulated market operator's alleged crimes to those of a company "legally" selling goods yet committing graft?

All innovative technologies that have changed the world (the car, the airplane, the radio, television, telephones, Internet etc) all took a while to catch on and had people confused initially. But when they took off.. adoption didn't do 1,2,3,4.. it was more like 1,2,4,10,100,1000..

I've used Blockchain.info for years, and almost all of the time things have been perfect (and **free**). The only issue I ever had was partly my fault and party BC.I's and their support went out of their way to make it right.
I also know Nic Cary, the CEO, and believe me.. the guy lives and breathes his company. He is a serious believer in bitcoin (as are everyone I know that works there). These guys are not "evil" by any stretch. Companies fuck up. It's how they respond to a fuckup that they should be graded on.
Circle for example, had their email system go haywire and started sending out upwards of 50emails to users per hour telling them phantom deposits were cleared via ACH to their account. This sent many users into panic mode. Obviously no real money was involved and it was just an email hiccup. Circle apologized, and the situation was forgotten.
Blockchain.info's recent issue was their fault - and I know for a fact they're making every affected user whole. Some scammers are probably going to fall through the cracks, and they're aware of this as well. This increases my respect for them. 
In the past, majority of "issues" people were having with BC.I was actually due to user negligence and bad security practices. Sorry.. but that's **not on them** if you get phished or don't have 2FA on your wallet *and* Gmail or don't have email wallet backups turned off (which they now are by default) or have an insecure Dropbox, or re-use credentials on other sites. 
To err is human, to forgive is divine. I say we put down the pitchforks and give these guys a break. And obviously, several 0-Day accounts are popping out of the woodwork (as expected) and shouting from the rooftops, fanning the flame at *just* the right time. Perfectly normal.
Every other web wallet behaves like a bank and demands damn near your grandmothers assprint just to open a wallet. Blockchain.info allows you to open a wallet without even an email address and private keys remain client side! It doesn't get better then that for the privacy conscious. Let's  remember BC.I started as 1 guy running it off a Mac Mini and has become what it is today. Every company has growing pains. And at the end of the day we all love that *beep* :)
Props for all the hard work and being committed to all your users:

I haven't seen much "talking about bitcoin". You seem driven by *something* to hate on it.

You could see why people don't believe you're interested in talking about **bitcoin** unless it's in the negative. And the fact that it's almost rampant.. lends credibility to you having a vested interest driving you.

Maybe an asterix or disclaimer), but some of the cards like Express (and now Best Buy) only let you buy cards in very small increments. 
Anyone with me on this issue? I know Gyft support told me the other day that the merchants set the rules .. but I've seen Best Buy or Express gift cards (physical) worth more then $10 or $20.. so.. yeah.
Either way, good job Gyft with the Best Buy thing.

I've actually thought about this - if Walt had converted his money to bitcoin over time. A fundamental problem (essentially the *catalyst*) for everything going to shit in the desert would have been averted. All he'd have to do was memorize a 12 word electrum seed! And at the time of barrels being buried, he was putting like $80M in cash in the desert. That'd be like a quarter million dollars worth of BTC right now.
Even the whole part about getting Gretchen and Elliot to launder his money and get it to his family would have been unnecessary. He was smart - he probably could have figured out some time-locked multi-sig setup. At some point Skylar and Jr would have given in, imported the private keys into a wallet and gone to town.

Pretty sure his attorneys had considerable influence on him agreeing to (on paper). When you're in his position - a lot of what happens is his attorneys say that so and so is going to happen, that'd the best situation right now, so please sign on the dotted line. His ability to say *"we'll hold on just a minute, let me take this home and research the pros and cons"* are pretty much nill. And attorneys know how to maneuver so that they get paid no matter what.

Thanks man! That's awesome. Well I was thinking about waiting for actual videos to come in before any funds are solicited.. only because what if no videos come in? I'm hesitant to hold funds for anyone in the event it has to be returned.
Yourself, and Nic Cary of Blockchain (and me) have already pledged to donate. Plus the owner of BTCTrinkets.com has pledged anything from their selection + free shipping.
How do you propose I do this? Shall I setup a BTC address and put it in the OP? That way people can see on the blockchain that the "winner" got every single bit of the funds. Do you think that would work?
I certainly won't be running off with anyones donating funds.. A) I'm not that kind of person B) My personal details are plastered allover the Internet from the Google/Bitcoin debacle.. so that's just out of the question.
So, a BTC address in the OP?

Really cool! [Here's a pic of a bitcoin birthday cake my fiance made me]( on my birthday.
Which happens to be January 3rd  :)
Btw - she's been hearing about bitcoin for over 2 years now. At first she was completely clueless, then after a few months she started understanding (no choice really when I'm talking about it 24/7) the basics, and about a year or so ago I'd get texts like "hey so I just set up an account on blockchain.info" (heh - *account*) and then "Hey my Coinbase account is verified!" all excited. Fast fwd and she now uses Circle/Gyft on her phone and has probably gone through Victoria Secret and Sephora cards like a crack addict. *Her* coworkers/relatives have told me they've got into bitcoin because of her. 
Here we have a classic word of mouth ripple effect. And yes I've given her a few btc to "play with" - but I'm weary of her doing dumb shit like emailing herself passwords. I wonder if prenups cover private keys...
@_date: 2014-06-27 10:55:57
Copy and paste errors are usually the culprit. My only gripe with BTC addresses (and I love everything BTC) is the fact that "addresses" are confusing (for the common Joe) .Something like: 15K2rVHkiWVELS6EUtkjzp9EPwTA is easy to make a mistake with when you're dealing with multiple addresses that all look the same-ish. I'd check the first few characters and last few characters before any transaction twice or thrice just to be sure you didn't copy/paste the wrong address.. otherwise not only does the person usually end up screwed out of BTC, but threads are born that become Coinbase or BC.I troubleshooting 101. Just sayin'

Please guys, let's use our collective IQs. You think Satoshi is going to "negotiate" with some wanker who cracked his old unused email acccount? And pay him off? No, never gonna happen.
Satoshi is by far too smart for that (and presumably far to smart to have identifying information lying in any email account). And frankly, if the real Satoshi did communicate with the cracker (doubtful), why would he negotiate? The cracker would dox him, and then? The person(s) doxxed would just say nope.. never heard of bitcom (*cough*).. it ain't me.
If this hacker had half a (devious) brain or was old enough to own a bank account - he could have theoretically temporaily manipulated the markets the likes of which would be astronomical. He didn't because he couldn't - and is thus resorting to drumming up 15 minutes of fame (thats working) and think the bitcoin community is going to pay 25 BTC to protect Satoshi from being "outed" by this asshole.
I'm sure the bitcoin community would pool 10X that much money if there was a credible threat to the safety of the real Satoshi (hell, even 1 wealthy holder could).. but no, it's not working. Hence concocting this ludicrous scenario of the hacker communicating with SN and offering up interviews etc.
And then theres the fact that this same prick tried to extort Roger Ver. 
IMHO the more we feed this beast, the longer this farce continues, and it helps bitcoin zilch @ a critical juncture in time when BTC is moving from grassroots to the big leagues.

Yeah, I take strong offense to "In other words, it was too good to be true." That implies I made it up. **Which I didn't**. I also reached out to the author of that piece of TheNextWeb and separately, very cordially, to which they did not respond. 
Other media outlets such as Forbes, Vice, Coindesk, Bizjournal, Business Insider, The Daily Dot and various well known tech bloggers **ALL** requested various forms of authentication and ways to verify the validity of those emails after they contacted me. I happily obliged in any way they asked. "ThNextWeb", who'm I'll be honest I had not even heard of prior to this stuff.. I'm sure they're a great publication. But to call my "claims" "too good to be true" is actual bullshit. And while we're at it, I challenge the author Mr. Emil Protalinski to behave like a proper journalist and ask me my side and demand I provide evidence.
Lesson in proper journalism 101:
1)Party A says XYZ.
2Party B initially shies away from XYZ.
3)Proper Journalist Joe asks Party A for their side of the story, and requests corroboratory evidence/proof.
4)Proper Journalist Joe asks Party B wether Party A (the originator) is lying, yes or no?
5) Proper Journalist publishes the results of his journalistic endeavors
Nowhere in this 101 Primer does the Journalist **ever** refer to any side of the story as "true good to be true". Once that happens, it becomes opinion, not fact. 
Anyways, I digress. Google (a company I love) might not have any **current** plans regarding bitcoing, but **current** could mean **this very second**. As in "I **currently** have no plans to eat Quiznos for lunch, but **in two hours** I might". This is all semantics and to be honest, I don't mind whatever 1 single spokesman said or might have said to TheNextWeb immediately after I posted those emails. In fact, can THENEXTWEB provide screen shots of *THEIR* interaction? Hm? 
This is a case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing. You all saw those emails, and saw the chain of events, and saw the wording. Sridhar Ramasaway said "we are working in the payments team to figure out how to incorporate bitcoin into our plans". Lots of companies (like Amazon) have said "we have **no** plans to incorporate bitcoin". Yet Sridhar says "we **ARE** working in the payments team to incorporate bitcoin into our plans". 
This was confirmed here: 
Google categorically admitted those exchanges, and then issued their corporate speak.
I challenge The Next Web to redact their misleading title. Their title is 180degrees in opposition to Sridhar's "*we are working in the payments team to figure out how to incorporate bitcoin into our plans*"
TheNextWeb's article's title *should have been* "Google Exec says they are working in their payments team figure out how to include bitcoin into their plans".
**I'm openly and publicly challenging TheNextWeb and the *journalist* of that piece. If they can get Google to make a statement saying those email exchanges never occurred, I will give 10 BTC to TheNextWeb and 10 BTC to Emil Protalinski the author**
If Google says "**those emails did not happen**" or "**this individual did not have those exchanges**" or even **"our executives, did not say "we are working in the payments team to figure out how to incorporate bitcoin**", I will immediately make a payment of **10BTC to The Next Web**, and **10 BTC goes to Emil**. Ontop of that I will apologize for *inventing* the whole thing, and I will submit myself to any legal action by Google and/or Mr. Sridhar Ramaswamy for lying about what he said. 
**However**, if I'm right and Sridhar Ramasway **did say** "*we are working in the payments team to figure out how to incorporate bitcoin*" I want an apology from TheNextWeb for calling my claims "*too good to be true*". I don't want their money. I want an apology for specifically using that wording, which implies I lied.
So then, TheNextWeb &amp; Mr. Emil Protalinksi, it's your move.

Why does that worry you? Eventually they will figure out a way to monetize their service (as is any business's right). As long as nothing is "hidden" (which it's not based on my experience with Circle.. incidentally have all been amazing) - these guys are going to make a **huge** impact in the bitcoin ecosystem post-beta. I somehow doubt they're thinking short term profits. They've obviously got some plan(s) to be profitable *eventually* - maybe introducing tiered/premium services. I highly doubt they will introduce ads.. that'd be counter to the whole aesthetic/UX they're nursing very carefully.
Who knows? Google, Facebook, Twitter are all "free" yet they've monetized pretty well. For all I care if the service rocks, I don't really mind being the product. There are no free lunches, and I'm cool with that.
@_date: 2014-12-08 21:54:46
How do you know definitely all these stories aren't BS? I stated that I actually believe yours and I feel for you.. I think it sucks and I hope your situation is resolved. But you can't possibly think people aren't going to take advantage of innocent people getting fucked (such as you) and use it to concoct their own scams. 
As far as $40k going missing from the most reliable bitcoin business on the planet - 
1) No bitcoin business is "the most reliable". You're confusing "most well known" with reliable. The only way to guarantee absolute security of your btc is to use an offline wallet setup. Services have been and will always be weak links in the chain of security. Second to only human negligence and poor personal security.
2) Without going into specifics I've had double that amount go into "limbo" from said service due to a combination of a bug on their end and a mistake on my part (causing a perfect storm) once, and I was very stressed out. I logged a support ticket, provided as much information as possible. This was on a holiday that almost nobody works. They went above and beyond to investigate/verify and  to "make it right".  And I learned a very, very valuable lesson about btc security. (Granted this was before they were as big as they are now, so I'm not sure what their setup is like currently. I will say this: Nic Cary, Ben Reeves and Mandarik are all extremely honest and hard working folks.) 
I can't speak on their behalf but I will venture a guess and say that if you lost your btc and it was their fault.. they will make it right.

Well yeah, but you gotta remember this is the 3rd world. The street level thieves  have no idea how to read or write in most cases. They won't know what a private key is. They're **just recently** demanding the victims give them the "pin number" when stumbling onto a bank card. Additionally - they don't torture the robbery victims, it's more of a gunpoint holdup (in  many cases not even that - just a knock on the car window and flashing a pistol) where both the victim and robber go through the motions in under 2 minutes. Sad really.
Now, if bitcoin were to take off and people were keeping mobile wallets - then yeah, it's possible the crime syndicates who run the street level guys will get wise to it and educate themselves on keys etc. That's probably a long ways off in the developing world though.

This is a bit silly. Blockchain.Info is **not** "leaking email addresses" as your sensationalist title claims.
If a valid email address that's registered is entered and a person click's "I forgot my password" and you get a "We have sent a reminder/reset/whatever to you" page - this is not leaking by any definition. Nearly 99% of websites that require a login work like this. 
This is not BC.I's fault - this is the fault of whichever service/site is selling email addresses of their users. You, being a dev for a long time, should know that.

Some perspective - a year ago, you couldn't Google Bitcoin without some bullshit about Silkroad being in every article. Nowadays, you can't read about BTC without the Gox stuff overshadowing all the cool innovations etc. 
Now that this saga has come to it's logical (and sad) end, at least there's no where to go but "up" (and I don't just mean price).

Yeah about that.. Never underestimate the creativity of a desperate lot. They'll find a way to blather on about something or the other. I think a majority of the trolls are simply bitter. Some of them are clearly shilling for "other" vested interests and a few are just kids. 
They're left with nothing now other then "ha ha 1200 ha ha price down ha ha". I don't think people understand the implications of a company like Microsoft coming out full swing with long term plans (BitPay wouldn't even have said MS has a strong long  term vision unless they were comfortable enough to leave that teaser) for bitcoin integration. When the price wipes it's ass with $1200 and easily another 0 (which the laws of supply/demand nearly guarantee) I will chuckle at all the time and energy the buttcoiners wasted obsessing over a battle they never stood a chance to win in the first place. Fuck them.

Ok - why on God's Green Earth would someone down-vote this guy for saying *"nice"*?! That makes no sense. This is literal proof of active down-vote bots or actual human beings hitting the down arrow in this sub on purpose. There's no other fathomable reason. Which, while annoying, is actually a good thing. Someone out there consciously spends resources hating on *anything at all* bitcoin related. Either bitter, threatened, or both.

Pakistan has a **LOT** of remittance that comes in from other parts of the world, and Western Union makes a killing there in fees. Additionally, Western Union agents (**and bank tellers**) are notoriously corrupt and often time whenever a significant sum of remittance/wire comes through, people have to hide the cash as they leave the bank/WU location because thieves have been tipped off and are waiting outside and/or will follow you and rob you on the street.
"Snatching" (as it's called) is a very common phenomena (esp in Karachi - the commercial hub &amp; port city) and mobile phones/wallets/jewelry are often robbed at gunpoint with police *literally* looking the other way (so much so that it's tragically comical). People often keep dummy cell phones/wallets in the car knowing they'll get robbed.
That said, almost everyone and their mother has a smart phone in Pakistan, and Android phones are a dime a dozen. The urban elite have both iPhones and Android based phones. Even working class folks (drivers, day laborers etc) have some phone running Android.
If there was ever a country that has a dire need for btc as remittance/money transferring - Pakistan would be a prime example. The thieves would not hold a gun to your head and demand your private keys or Electrum seed. And if they got your phone (that contains a bitcoin wallet), they would not have a clue what to do with it. (They have an intricate network where the jacked phones are re-sold as *clean* in the regular cell phone shops/bazaars)
Carrying anything tangibly valuable from Point A to Point B has become the bane of most people in Pakistan's existence unless they can afford armed guards 24/7. And often the guards also tip off criminal elements as to how much cash/gold/ people have in their homes. 
The hurdle would be getting merchants to accept BTC and setting up BTC/fiat exchanges.
Edit: Forgot to add, with 3G service and scratch-cards that add data/minutes to your cellphones, in addition to the Internet which is extremely prevalent in Pakistan, bitcoin makes a lot of sense. The only issue is that electricity suffers from rolling blackouts (aka "loadshedding") in swaths of the country. The upper-middle class/wealthy do have generators and UPS backups -  but as long as cell phones are charged, even the guy driving a rickshaw could have no problem getting paid in bitcoin. The biggest issue IMO would be **educating the people** as a vast majority of the population is uneducated and don't even know what email is (yet they have mobile phones,ringtones,etc).
@_date: 2014-01-15 18:21:21
Well, that's just like.. your opinion dude. Time will tell, won't it? And also I think you're absolutely right about it being exponentially harder for it "to go to $1 to $100 then to $100 to $1000". Was that a typo? If so, then you meant to say it's "exponentially harder for it to go from $100 to $1000 then from $1 to $100" - to which I'd say you're flat wrong. Historically, disruptive technologies have had exponential adoption rates. The radio, television, personal computer, Internet etc. All these new techs didn't do 1,2,3,4. They did 1,2,5,10,100. That is a fact.

Better suggestion - tell him to give bitcoin a try. Similar properties to cash except it can't be created out of the whims of bankers and the govt. And he's not at the risk that comes with "pull" payment methods. Bitcoin is a "push" method of transferring value. He'd love it.

"I like talking about bitcoins" is a weak answer - but hey, you answered my question so I'll keep up my end and answer yours.
Your Question: *What was the outcome of your breathless play by play post about emailing with google, anyway?*
My Answer: A quite a bit of mainstream media press relentlessly pressed Google for an answer if they were in fact planning to integrate bitcoin in some form. After an initial cookie-cutter non-response, they finally acknowledged those exchanges were authentic and thus validated the position that Google is in fact working to integrate bitcoin.
Additionally, had a few interesting chats RE bitcoin integration plans with CEO and SVP level of a few tech juggernauts (who I promised not to publicly disclose the who/what and I will honor that) who have similar plans in the works. Rather exciting actually.

LOL @ Cyrus Vance's comment  I literally read it in the voice of a teacher from the Charlie Brown cartoons. *"Wahn wahn wahn wahn wahn, wahn wahn.."*.
Anyways, this is an interesting development.The overwhelming majority of these comments are in line with the POV most intelligent, forward thinking, tech savvy individuals who grasp the importance of not stifling this innovative tech. (People such as Jerry Brito).
Lawsky's Office is not stupid. Obviously I'm sure they removed inappropriate commentary submitted such as "eat my ass lawsky!!" - but they're pretty transparent with these comments. 
Therefore - the revised regulations, I'm not entirely convinced they will be as idiotic and harsh/unfair as the first time regulations were announced. I'm not saying regulation is a good thing, but it's inevitable, and Lawsky and his people *seem* like they got the point. We won't know till later this month. But I wouldn't be shocked if the regs aren't as draconian as in the first go around.

Bingo. And when the adults/parents realize they're not having to pay a middleman (bank/credit cards/WU) to send each other money.. it will be a eureka moment. No matter how much good PR bitcoin has gotten in the past, no matter how many other big companies (which actually all *combined* are smaller then Microsoft) "accept bitcoin", nothing is a bigger motivation/driver/source of information for parents then their kids. The feedback loop this will create.. good God. The implications here are mind boggling.
Why not just give the kids allowance in bitcoin? When the price of bitcoin goes up, why not invest a few grand for themselves? Why not XYZ, ABC, Etc? 
Didn't see this coming, but it's utterly massive and no naysayer on earth can deny it with a straight face.

Or did they take it upon themselves to seize and auction an innocent (until proven otherwise)'s guys shit? And while we are on the topic has it just become an accepted thing to drop the word alleged?
The system is so rigged. Some senator can solicit sex in an airport bathroom or sext dick-picks to college chicks and the word "allegedly" is painstakingly added, bolded and under lined.
HSBC can literally create teller windows designed to allow duffel bags of cash to be easily slid through and deposited in Juarez cartel banks ... Yet...

People are averse to change. Fuck 'em, not our problem. The way I see it, "us" (the BTC community per se) have done our job (I know I sure have) evangelizing, if you will, bitcoin and the genius technological/historical implications for a while now. I think people need to figure it out without hand-holding and defending at this point. Adoption is climbing, mainstream press has made it *almost* a household word.. 
I don't bother raising a unit of blood pressure trying to convince anyone or defend how bitcoin is a game-changer anymore. That's so 2012. I give them the Internet/Email analogy and thats it. Upto them.

Excellent response to a sad, delusional, ignoramus. The posters comment "Keep muslim crap out of everything" is down right retarded. I actually saw a lady in a bar the other day, middle aged, you could tell her diet consists of Miller Lite and Burger King all day. She was singing along to the songs playing in the bar, and Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody" came on. She starts singing along (while panting and occasionally stuffing her face with cheese fries), and then that part in the song where Freddie Mercury goes *"Bismillah! Will not let you go, let him gooo, bismilllah we will not let you go, let him gooo"* comes on and this lady had a near meltdown. She slammed the bar with her fist and goes "NO! I forgot this song had muslim crap in it, change it!" to the bartender. The bartender and some younger chick looked at each other and mouthed the word "wow". 
It's a classic rock song! Just realized that musta been sandtrappers kin folk. LOL.

Joehoe is seriously the Bitcoin Saint. What's he at like now, returning 400 btc? Maybe I'm cynical, but I'm not so sure a lot of people would *ever* do that. Well.. I suppose there'd be IP logs so if he had been malicious (which he's not - the dude is seriously 1 in a million), but since BC.I doesn't actually "control" the private keys.. not sure the legality of how they'd handle it if he was malicious+they knew his identity.

Edit: Christ what have I done? Ok. A guy **ate his hat** and manned up. I guess I will too. If bitcoin hits **$10,000/BTC next week (Tuesday, November 4th 2014).** I will buy everyone in this thread (who's commented so far and and will within the next 15 minutes (it's already been an hour and I'm apparently nearly 1 whole $10k BTC already in the hole) 1 brand new mobile phone.

This woman clearly lied (misled?) Gavin, probably Dorian's family members (initially), the model train maker.. etc. We have a pattern of deceit. 
What if "I'm not involved in that anymore" was really "I'm not involved in that **at all**" and she took the liberty of *mishearing*? 
Or even.. I dunno.. "I'm not involved in that you whore" (just sayin'), or "I'm not involved in that**.**" and she simply added in the *anymore*".?
Initially after reading this piece I was furious that she violated a man's privacy who clearly wanted nothing but privacy. The more I think about it, her smoking gun is a few words that could have been misheard or frankly pulled out of her ass.

I actually did think about that. The only issue is what's to stop someone from registering a brand new account, making a post or two in some other thread and then vote &amp; comment? Who draws the line as to how old an account has to be, or who qualifies/doesn't? Every rule introduced will have someone with a valid (or invalid) argument against it.. and the entire thing will turn into a circus.

Wow, this entire thread is amusing. First of all - is it me or is defending trolls suddenly a thing? It's like "I will kiss troll ass because it makes me appear intellectually secure enough to handle contrarian views". 
Last time I checked, this was not If you go into or you will see, naturally, proponents of those topics. Right? To assume that it's wrong for people who are into bitcoin (such as I am, and have been for years) to get annoyed by the likes of guys like Witcoin et all is kind of silly. 
It's not the contrary viewpoints - hell, I love healthy discussion and am usual the first person to find *some* common ground in a healthy debate. It's the mature thing to do and expands your intellectual horizons. It's the 24/7 anti-bitcoin vitriol that some people have dedicated their entire waking minute to post on reddit that is loathed. Some of them are so obsessed that they are either certifiably insane or have some ulterior motive. And to deny that is naive. 
But.. what's with all this reaching across the isle and defending a trolls right to troll shit lately? Fuck that. I'm proud to be an early adopter of this innovative technology, I'm glad it's gaining mainstream momentum, I'm happy that the tech world is taking it seriously, and the fact it's price has gone from pennies to $330 infront of my eyes is icing on the cake.
If we're all about free and fair right to opine - then we shouldn't be Buttcoin Apologists. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em x100. I'm proud of bitcoin and will defend it. Although that seems to be so politically incorrect these days.

I don't think were on the same page, friend. I wasn't referring to any *activism* - I was referring to your dismissive attitude towards this guy's unfortunate plight. You casually say that since he'll be out in two years, people should "chill". Two years is a long time - you're aware, right? To have your freedom stripped away for two years, for what is arguably a victimless crime (that **does not** hamper anyone's freedom) is unfair. For you to say he wasn't railroaded, what are you talking about? He was made an example of. Was it necessary to arrest him upon his arrival at JFK airport and walk him out, handcuffed, with the media conveniently tipped off  - which btw was right before the NYDFS hearing on virtual currencies? You're telling me that wasn't a concerted effort? You seem smart enough, please ask yourself.
And second of all, just because it's a common occurence does not mean it's fair, logical, or realistic. HSBC had bank branches in Jaurez re-construct the teller windows so that large bags/cases of cash could be fit &amp; slid to the teller for deposit. There were also no suspicious activity reports filed, and drug cartels were going to town. It was understood that these banks were turning a blind eye. How many HSBC personell (tellers all the way up to the chain to executive level) did a second of jail time for facilitating drug money laundering? **0**. And why? Because that would have shook the faith of the Average Joe in the banking system, so the punishment was to fine them (not my conjecture, this has been documented). 
You realize cartels are carving up cities vying to control the drug trade? There's violence behind that money. But ok, let's forget that for a second. "Money laundering" in itself is a very vague and often bogus charge. And in Charlie's case - victimless. Certainly not befitting stripping of his freedom.
But still, the law is the law and he pled guilty - that's fine. But *your* dismissive attitude towards a young guy doing two years in prison is ridiculous. I know people who've done 1 year, 2 years, 3+ years in prison. It's not something to "chill" about - it's quite serious.

Correct, and that's totally legal between two parties (of age) in some states. I think there are probably better, more established classifieds geared towards that. Lots of classifieds style sites as a rule of thumb stay away because while private sales are allowed by law, "dealers" are required to have an FFL. It's just currently above my scope (and intellect) to make sure there's no legal ramifications. Although you make a very good point and I think I'll check with an attorney and possibly adjust that.

I pose this question: assuming Gox does not straighten up their act/come out with a full explanation/do right by anyone with "stuck" funds... what can we, as a collective community do?
If Gox just "goes away" in one instant.. that will wreak havoc on so many levels. If you thought Charlie Shrem's arrest headlines of "Bitcoin CEO arrested" were bad.. imagine the field day the sensationalist media would have with that. Secondly, people have funds (at this point let's just forget about fiat and assume BTC is the only way out) they need, which can't just go *poof*.
So what's solution to the problem? What should Gox and/or the bitcoin community in general do? 
@_date: 2014-02-10 15:52:24
Kudos to Greg. Gox should be ashamed of this latest stunt. The audacity man..wording that press release in a misleading fashion attempting to blame the bitcoin protocol and not their own shitty code? Shame on them. No, fuck them. Yeah that's better.

[Buffet famously called bitcoin a "mirage" and told people to "stay away"](
Therefore, if bitcoin were to reach $10,000 USD per unit (not to mention by next week), it would be safe to say Warren Buffet would at that point be completely wrong. You asking him if he's mad would be a way of rubbing it in his face and gloating. It shouldn't take more then a few minutes. He'd be yelling for you to get off his lawn anyways 10 minutes into it.

No.. we've had more correspondence since then. They're absolutely doing it. I appreciate you analyzing each word.. but I've had an ongoing dialogue with them, and it's not a matter of semantics.

Looks like it. Dated Decemeber 5th. Not sure if it was uploaded then. OP - how'd you come across this?
And yeah - seems like for taxation purposes, NY State defines BTC transactions as rather simple and not as convoluted and whacky as previously suggested. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 19:41:30
Probably the most logical answer to the OP's question - except it will come with some degree of risk. First of all the bank is probably not going to say no to you if you (or the seller) bank there and speak to the manager about it. The bank may even offer one of those currency verifying pens (there was an story floating around here &amp; btctalk about that one debacle in the UK where the guy brought counterfeit cash). Do your homework though, even if the bitcoin is escrowed through localbitcoin, you can bet your ass (or your atleast 25k) that scammers will pop out of the woodwork. People will offer you more then 25k's worth to do it "out of escrow because of the cut LBC takes" and other kinds of bullshit. And the elephant in the room here is that you will also attract the eyes of law enforcement, you just will. As long as you have a legitimate trail of where that cash came from you're fine and you're doing nothing wrong. (And I know that's nobody business etc, but let's be realistic - if you get pulled over for missing a stop sign and you're carrying around $25,000 in cash with you, be prepared to get badgered). If you and the seller agree to a cashier's check, then go to town - no problems. 
You'll want to make sure the seller is legitimate and has a solid history/feedback on the site. YOU'RE not doing anything wrong - but anyone selling 25,000 dollars worth of BTC for cash and openly advertising it is already on someone's radar, that's just the shitty part of it. The whacky ways the laws are in the US (assuming you're from the US), you may inadvertently be facilitating someone else in money laundering.

I agree with all you said. I think my point was not so much that the USG forced-auctioned Ulbricht's bitcoin. It was mutually agreed upon by both sides - so nobody should cry over anything there. I'm just bothered by the notion that this man's personal bitcoin was seized to begin with (I could be wrong - but I believe this particular set of btc wasn't from the Silk Road servers, rather they were on Ross Ulbricht's computer and he has claimed ownership of them) as if they are the proceeds of crime. Silk Road server bitcoin were clearly the proceeds of a crime (well, as crime is "defined". Whether the service it provided was wrong is another rabbit hole for another discussion) by all accounts. Ulbricht's personal stash has in no way been proved in a court of law to have originated from the crimes he's alleged to have committed. He could have found them on a USB stick walking on the beach - or mined them, or been gifted them by Satoshi.  
I'm sure more will come out in trial and unfortunately I'm sure the government will make a pretty damning case. But in the documents/indictment I read - I saw no smoking gun linking his personal bitcoin (or any btc transaction IIRC) to the Silk Road. We're not privy to whatever evidence is available to the defense during discovery, so they very well might tie his personal btc to SR in trial. Although it's doubtful - as they'd have made that case during pre-trial motions and simply gotten the judge to sign off on allowing them to seize it fully and auction regardless of Ulbricht agreeing.

Huh? I'm sorry.. that genuinely went over my head. I was trying to say that there is a historical trend in the adoption rate of disruptive technology. With something like BTC (which has a fixed supply), increased adoption rate absolutely has to equal an increase in demand. There's a fixed suppy.. increased demand... it's quite simple to see the likely outcome.
Also - Bitcoin being worth $100,000 hardly equates to Bitcoin stopping investment banks. I don't think anyone made that connection.

Thanks Jason. I (we all) trust you. Just to clarify, you've seen the whole shibang and the screen shots of the emails right? And the deal is TheNextWeb and the author of that piece Emil Protalinski claiming "they were too good to be true", which is tantamount to suggesting I invented them out of thin air. 
The "bet" shall we say is TheNextWeb either clarifies that Sridhar Ramaswamy of Google **did** say *"we ARE working in the payments team to figure out how to incorporate bitcoin into our plans"* and the other emails were also valid and not "too good to be true" (and print this retraction) or they stand by their insinuations that I fabricated/invented them with a statement from Google backing their claim.
If Google denies those emails and denies that was said, 10 BTC goes to TheNextWeb, 10BTC goes to Emil.

This is it. And judging by the fact of today's filing.. the writing is on the wall. The SEC would have (I believe) allowed them to bow out gracefully if they were going to kill it. As of today if the Winkelvii are filing a prospectus, it doesn't take a genius or inside information to see that they're getting their ducks in a row for an approval.

Sorry to hear about your loss. Out of curiosity, since both your laptops were stolen - how are you posting on Reddit? I'm guessing a phone or someone else's machine? Also - why the throwaway?

I like that - very zen. But yeah - good point. For every seller there's a buyer (I think.. I'm not a trader, I'm old school cold storage hodler). But I'm assuming that people who panic sell right into the hands of those that are either speculators or holders. So if bitcoin gets distributed from shaky, panicked hands and short term speculators into the hands of people who understand the insane ramifications of one of, IMHO, the most innovative technologies of our lifetime.. then well, shit, even better.

I see what you're saying.. but the point is, IF Mark is DPR and Ashley was a liability for him, why (would both of them) go through the whole charade of blackmailing/hells angels etc?
If Ashley is FriendlyChemist, and Mark is DPR, then DPR would not need to wait a few days and be extorted, only then order the hit (a hit, btw, that was by virtue of FriendlyChemist's "supplier" contacting DPR, and just happening to be a Hells Angel shot caller. And *even then*, why would DPR **not have Ashley's information**? The govt indictment clearly shows that DPR did not have information about FriendlyChemist and obtained it somehow from somewhere else (possibly a Silk Road vendor). How can that be, if he knew who he was? And to top it off - the US and Canadian feds say nobody was killed, and they basically have no idea WTF that was all about other then possibly a giant scam. The indictment would have had Ashley's name in it.
So far.. it seems the only real connection is as such:
1) Ashley worked with Mark
2) As of yesterday we find out DHS once assumed Mark to be DPR and Ashley to be DPR's voice
3) Ashley lives in the vicinity of White Rock
4) The FriendlyChemist/RedAndWhite murder for hire bullshit happened (or didnt happen) in White Rock.
Because Ashley is a pothead looking dude who doesn't have much of an online presence after 2012.. that's not a smoking gun.
But I'm with ya man, I want Mark to be DPR just as much as everyone else.

Man I got to give it to these guys - they've handled this situation **very** well considering the pure amount of debacles, bad luck, and perfect storms that bitcoin has endured. We're still living in the shadows of the MtGox implosion, and just when we thought the Silk Road stigma was gone, it was back briefly, then gone (but still kinda hovering in the periphery).
I think Bitstamp is doing everything possible to rectify this fuck up (and fuckups happen! Target? Walmart? Neiman Marcus? Macys? etc etc), make the affected customers whole (a promise I absolutely know for a fact will be kept), rework their security infrastructure and be honest (as can be without compromising what is certain to be a criminal investigation) about the hack, and keep people periodically updated without the  surreal *"update about an update"* from the Gox  Playbook.
Stamp knows the stakes (being the defacto bitcoin exchange top dog), they're answerable to their customers and VC's, and they're smart, honest dudes.
And for the price-friends who were calling the end of bitcoin (LOL).. yeah.. about that..

He spends 12 hours on and another few hours on his Twitter account.. which is **nothing but demonizing bitcoin**. When confronted by the sheer amount of time and effort he puts into all this, his usual deflection is that *"You're crazy/strange/odd"* or downplays the effort and time by simply dodging the topic.
[Over **5,000** tweets, mostly about bitcoin] ( and yet he suggests people ".. vastly overestimate the time and effort of making posts on reddit in a world where smartphones exist".
To give that some context, this guy has nearly 5,000 tweets about bitcoin alone (almost all with the same ants-in-my-pants, bland, unfunny underdog troll shtick he's got on Reddit) whereas [Lady Gaga has **6,000** tweets about various random shit] (

Well - a lot of scams don't  start out with nefarious intentions.. Promises get hard to keep, fundamentals break down, and chaos ensues - resulting in a lot of people left losing their shirt. Anyways, I watched the live stream of Garza yesterday and it was obvious that he is in way over his head and I do feel that this whole thing is going to collapse. People will lose money.
That said, I hope not. My personal (or many others) opinions don't mean jack shit. People are free to do whatever they want and put their money wherever they want. Free market baby. You seem like an intelligent, articulate person. I didn't mean to be a dick to you. Whatever motivation you have to defend Paycoin and Garza.. Seems like it stems from conviction and all that. Perhaps there's a chance you're right. You certainly seem loyal to it/him. 
Sometimes though - the writing is on the wall. If you put aside any bias you might have, you can't deny that the entire thing seems like a train wreck. If you don't feel that way.. well, I wish you the best.

I thought I stood corrected. You have said you don't care about bitcoin - so my question.. which you've managed to avoid answering, is what fuels you  spending so much time in a discussion subreddit relating to something you don't care about? It might be in your previous comment.. but I guess I didn't understand. Could you answer that question, instead of dodging it? You're doing everything in your power to avoid admitting your behavior is pathetic (and I'm not helping by being too lazy to examine your previous comment). And I'm sorry, but you're lying.

They are ruthless, they are resourceful, politically connected, and they will make goddamn sure they can get a "deal" on something they invest in.. and if theres an unregulated market, you can bet you will not know what hit you. "Wall Street" will do everything it can to manipulate to their advantage. I know guys in that industry, and I know the mindset.

Wait, hold on. Something about this seems preposterous. The way I read it, the FriendlyChemist character was **blackmailing** DPR and threatening to release customer information? And then later DPR thought he paid the Hells Angels to whack the dude. But the criminal complaint says he was waiting on an address and only had the first name or something - and then something about the Canadian police saying they have no record of a hit happening. Wouldn't the complaint have specifically mentioned Ashley Barr's name?! The way I read it, the name/address/person was an elaborate scam and the person didn't really exist. How would DPR not know Ashley Barr's name or address if he was his right hand man/ghostwriter? 
..or am I missing something?
Edit: err, but then I guess that *could* explain how "FriendlyChemist" got ahold of so much customer data.. if he was co-running the site. Oh fuck me, I can't believe I'm rationalizing this conspiracy connection.

Edit: So weird - the post (in which you said exactly what I said you did), I can't find it. Regardless - did you say something to the effect that you do "not own bitcoins" and "find it funny" being in bitcoin subreddits because you "don't care bitcoins". You said that, didn't you?

The OP must have deleted his post/had it deleted. It had your twitter page with over 5,000 tweets (seemingly mocking bitcoin.. I only skimmed and lost interest), and compared it to number of tweets 3 or 4 other twitter accounts that have less tweets then yours (Paul Mccartney, Selena Gomez, Bank of America, and Google). Google had something like a almost exactly the same amount as you, and the point was it's one of the largest companies in the world. 
I personally don't think having a Twitter with like 5,500 tweets all anti-bitcoin is trolling. It's an....opinion? It's definitely not funny really.. it's very obsessive. It's still got nothing to do with this sub though - hence why it was probably removed.
What OP was ineffectively trying to point out that for someone who acts like they dont give a shit about "bitcoins", the sheer amount of bitcoing related activity (mind you the tweets and posts for the most part aren't mindless FUCK BITCOIN FUCK BITCOIN.. they're articulate and targeted towards one, and only one topic.

Well I'll tell you this much, you put these connections together in less then 24 hours. I'm positive the defense and whatever private investigators they have will probably also bring up the Ashley/White Rock connection. And a jury of 12 people.. shit.. Reasonable doubt is not a stretch anymore.
I thought Ross was toast, but goddamn if Dratel hasn't earned his keep. The defense got a prosecutions witness (that too a fed who spent years on the case and even infiltrated DPRs inner circle) to say they were certain it was Kapeles till weeks before the arrest. I still think this Bullshit of "Oh a random IRS agent said nah, it's Ross Ulbricht  of San Francisco!" is a total lie. There was definetly some pararrel construction going on and we haven't even got to the fishy circumstances under which the server was found.  Bottom line is, while the defenses theory *probably* is a bit too out there to be true (I mean cmon. Karpeles the buffoon a digital drug kingpin?.. Reasonable doubt is all they need to aquit. And it's gonna be there by the time the jury goes to deliberation. If Ross gets off and Mark is suddenly in the dock, then fuck, karma IS a bitch!

No he was selling fireworks for btc to some guy who used localbitcoins to exchange the btc for fiat to purchase a laptop that was used to buy btc from coinbase and connect to the Silk Road via TOR to buy a book (which I read were sold there as well) on how to use PGP. Since he was an unlicensed WhaTheFucker™, the NSA parallel constructed a tax dodger narrative and claimed he repeatedly entered incorrect data into the captcha on IRS.gov until the server broke down. So he went to Japan but was taken hostage by MtGox extremists and forced to make a video statement validating their solvency otherwise face being injected by Ebola, followed by a beheading.

But why wouldn't McCaleb be in his Google Circle? Karpeles bought Gox from him. Ashley and Mark were apparently at Mt.Gox together. Why is it mind blowing that one of them would have the previous business owner in their social media network? Cmon man..

*".. if by 2pm Tokyo time, Mr. Karpeles isn't delivered an oversized Frappucino, a nude photograph of Bea Arthur autographed with the words I WANNA FUX MAGICALTUX, a gigantic bouncy ball cushion, and a fueled jet on standby ready to fly him to a country that does not extradite - he will chop off my finger. These demands are non negotiable. Also - I have looked at the MtGox books and they are completely solvent. They have a lot of bitcoin and money in their reserve, so much so that they're so flush with cash that Marks new penthouse is a marvelous place to v- oh, sorry, never mind.

Now that's settled, I do have a question I'm sure many people wonder. Since you admittedly don't care about Bitcoin, own any, use any, and find it funny.. what drives the sheer amount of time you dedicate to Btc related subs? Curiosity? Boredom? Excess free time? A perverse dislike?

Personally, if I was organizing the conf, I'd have quietly reached out to Garza and said "Sorry dude, we are going to have to refund your sponsor bucks and remove you as a sponsor in light of the current climate. You, your altcoin and this ongoing drama are way too controversial, 2015 is an important year for bitcoin, and we don't want YOU getting your ass handed to you by an audience, or federal agents showing up to arrest you for securities fraud, or some other debacle while the Miami Herald and CNBC have a field day." Or *something.* But this? 
Wow. There is no "both sides of the issue" - let's get real here, Paycoin is obviously bad news, and Garza is clearly fast on his way in joining Karpeles in the Hall of Shame, and what in pluperfect hell is this altcoin doing at the **NORTH AMERICAN BITCOIN CONFERENCE** in the first place? Christ.

Who's "you people"? It's actually not pulled out of my ass.. it's really not *that* hard to understand if you understand "guys in the industry" are, more specifically - people working in investment banking, hedge funds, mutual funds, etc. I can see how that could confuse you... 
Anyways, since I've been into btc for a few years now, naturally I speak enthusiastically about it amongst my friends, relatives and acquaintances - and gauge their perception. I know how greed works, I've seen vulgar displays of it, and I've seen people invest (and make stupid amounts of money) in innovative tech.
If you actually think people who are **in the business of making money** will not enter/take advantage of an extremely volatile, unregulated, first-of-its-kind market... you've got to be uniquely retarded.

I'm assuming it's because *actual* "good news" has inexplicably caused drops in btc/usd price. But this bitstamp news is not exactly "good news" - rather, it's the *opposite*.. so the joke is that this should cause a positive reaction (and uptick in btc/usd price) in the bizarro twilight zone cause&amp;effect world that bitcoin lives in.
I guess you'd have to have been there.. (.. for the last year or so). Heh.

I just read your initial comment. I apologize, you already answered my question! I'm amazed at how lazy I am.. it took me all of 5 seconds. 
Here it is right here : **"After I got banned again, I went back to /all/new and stumbled across a bitcoinmarkets post and got sucked into the vortex.
I really don't care about bitcoins at all which makes it even funnier that I've been turned into some sort of bitcoin bogeyman. I just like posting here because of the collection of people and weirdness always going on."**
So you like posting here because of the "collection of people and weirdness always going on". Well.. you got me there man. The vast majority of sane people would not spend all their time on Reddit posting/hanging around a sub because of the collection of people and weirdness going on... because they would have better things to do with their time or at least spend so much time posting/discussing things they *do* care about. Generally speaking, that's how adults function. But you've got every right to spend all your time here. It's fucking loony, but it's allowed.

It pains me to say this - but you're probably right that some of these sites just copy/paste from other sites and essentially spam this sub, creating noise. But another note - I read you posted (yesterday?) something about how you have no interest in bitcoin (financial, tech or other) and find it *"funny"* (paraphrasing) to hang around bitcoin related subreddits. You do realize that's.. bizarre, right? A lot of people here consider you a "Troll Bogeyman" (your words). Is this something you also find funny? Don't get me wrong, guy - if you have a lot of free time, by all means have at it. It's the fucking Internet - anything goes. But suppose you're a blowup sexdoll enthusiast (not saying you are, just giving an example).. and someone relentlessly/obsessively hangs out in researches sex dolls, points out every defective unit shipped, keeps current with every sexdoll blog/update/news, yet claims to "not really care" and says that makes it funny.

Right - it's not mandatory, it is optional, correct. However it's written everywhere on the site and there are several warnings about being wary of people wanting to avoid using escrow and multiple reminders (I think?) of using escrow otherwise you're at your own risk. I agree, it can be overwhelming for people new to trading bitcoin. But the burden of doing a little preliminary research lies on the user.
If you're new to Craigslist, you'd want to do a little bit of research first, before putting up your iPad for sale on it, right? Because inevitably you're going to get people sending you scammy emails and offering to wire/western you in exchange for mailing it to them, and all kinds of other scam bullshit. That wouldn't be Craigslist's fault. And Localbitcoins is a free-ish service. The $300 dollars you're paying someone is to to the someone, not to Localbitcoins. They do take a small fee for using escrow (which wasn't utilized in this instance so that point is moot), but its nominal. You can opt to not use escrow (and thus not pay LBC a penny) by using them (as a lot of people do) to meet buyers/sellers in your area and meet face to face, just like a Craigslist transaction. But that's not advised unless you really know what you're doing and understand the various scams out there. 
As for the ongoing convo with the scammer - ok, I guess it's a morbid curiosity kind of thing.
Anyways, it sucks you got scammed and I think thats a bummer. Think of this as an expensive lesson. Now you know why escrow is important, why even people with great feedback aren't angels, and that there are some assholes out there who have no conscience taking other peoples money.

As much as I'm not a fan of Coinbase, they do have a history of *not* fucking up in terms of partnerships and making headlines that aren't hot air. Let's face it, even though Circle (IMHO) is better (in terms of user experience/support/freshness).. Coinbase has slow and steadily went from a bitcoin site to *the* de facto place for US based customers (esp who don't want to use LBC) to acquire bitcoin. And when it comes to, as rapper T.I. so eloquently puts it *"big shit poppin'"* - Coinbase delivers.
I don't expect such a confident countdown/moon reference for something like Litecoin integration or anything actually *lunar* a la Brandson/Virgin Galactic.
Clearly it's something big, and they're milking the *"To the moon!"* sentiment popular in the bitcoin world.

No - this genie is out of the bottle now. Satoshi is highly regarded, but @ this point bitcoin is bigger then him  and thousands of "smart" people have analyzed and agreed that from a technical standpoint, it works. And unless Satoshi has been hitting the crack-pipe, it's highly unlikely he'd throw away years of precise and rock solid anonymity to burst through the door *Kramer from Seinfeld style* screaming about crazy new mathematics.

Yes at some point people in Europe and Japan were saying they were able to withdraw fiat.. and that's all good and fine, but I haven't even heard *that* in a while.

Another minor request (no PUN intended) - ability to set a fee...
I won't add to the cacophony and I don't want the ban hammer coming down on me for not posting this in the megathread so I'll just keep it light. But yes; setting fees would be helpful if things stay how they are or *something* isn't done soon. I keep most of my Btc in cold wallets - but I keep around 2 Btc on my phone for spending. I sent a tx the other day  for 1btc and it didn't confirm for half a day. Irritating for me but more for the recipient who's new to Bitcoin. Had to jump onto electrum and send another btc and set the fee outrageously high. Then walked him through returning the original 1BTC the following day (he was using Electrum).
I LOVE Breadwallet. For me it's the only iOS wallet I'd ever used. But this current situation is just..ugh.

Absolutely agree on the point about the upper class makes the rules (they're running the bureaucracy, the military brass, the judiciary, big businesses, and the government). So this a farce.
But I'd argue the middle class has slowly vanished by and large post-Musharraf era. From the General Ayub years till even the mid 90's there was somewhat of a definable "middle class". I've personally noticed that section of society become increasingly less visible. The poor have gotten a lot poorer, and the rich has gotten ridiculously more wealthy. There hasn't been much upward mobility, and the old middle class either slowly slipped into poverty, while the higher end of the middle class found ways to make a quick buck and entered the upper class as classic "new rich". And a lot of the traditional middle class saved as much as they could and emigrated out.

What alternatives exist to Circle? (Not counting Coinbase). 
This is really, really, bothersome. I use Circle all the time to buy bitcoin to use with Gyft, or make payments directly to services that accept bitcoin, etc because I don't feel like using my cold storage.
I'm sure I'm not alone. Circle was convenient, easy to use, and rarely if ever was there any bullshit as opposed to the daily Coinbase shenanigans their users reported.
What is the best alternatives? And no, Localbitcoins does not count since you will be price gouged and there's no "Click here to buy bitcoin" type slick app.

Coinbase got the letter, disclosed it, and surprisingly enough didn't roll over and is fighting it out in the courts (commendable). Circle just.. changed their entire business model. Wut.

Which is around $50 USD or so. But good luck with enforcing it. In Pakistan the average person does not transact in Rs5,000 notes. 100s, 500s, and 1,000s yes. Not 5k. Above that it's plastic (obviously meaning bank).
But the upper class (there's no middle class there - it's vanished over the last few decades), will still do whatever they want. They will use whatever big currency notes they have (and the ultra wealthy, legitimately/grey/or black market wise) will continue to use large notes and won't be scared into using domestic Pakistani bank accounts to transact in. Or they'll use foreign currency (Dollars and Pounds) for large cash transactions, which is very common. Or simply keep all their money overseas, which the upper class does mostly anyways.
Aside from being a primarily cash economy, in Pakistan, gold is a **huge** deal. The mentality has always been that gold is a safer store of value then anything - bank accounts (which can be frozen or confiscated by the government or even foreign exchange accounts frozen) are not considered as "secure" as gold, local currency is considered to be nothing compared to gold, it's also a status symbol that doubles as a store of value, on and on. It's also the only thing thieves look for when robbing homes. The masses are not educated, but even rickshaw drivers have smartphones (not necessarily iPhones but any of the gazillion Chinese made android devices). If bitcoin catches on, then Pakistan is a HUGE market. Not just internally but internationally due to the sheer amount of remittance from expats. 
I know of a few companies there (telecoms and even bitcoin startups) that are working furiously to find ways to make bitcoin a "thing". 
I read about this one specific startup founded by a kid who went to LUMS (the Pakistani equivalent of Harvard I guess, the top business school in the country) who started a bitcoin/payment app, I guess like Bitpay. Sounded promising as they won some award for ingenuity in the tech field + funding by some international org.

I've had a Gemini acct since they opened access in my state. Never used them before, but will now because Circle just shit the bed.
Question - it's my understanding that when buying BTC via Gemini, your balance isn't available immediately until the bank deposit clears, yes? Meaning even to buy a few hundred bucks worth of bitcoin isn't instant, rather depending on however long it takes to clear the bank deposit? (2-5 days or something).

I can tell you're an academic, nearly every point you bring up makes sense logically and technically - quite hard to dispute the logic behind the points you make. The only part I differ, is the topic of gold. You feel that gold is essentially a mirage (if I understand correctly) that's more of a nuisance then anything of substance. It's not stock in a company (that produces anything), it's a scheme to lure in "greater fools" - yes? (FWIW my brother in law has argued that same point with me). Now, while I agree that gold has no *intrinsic* use, I feel that because people use it as a store of value - it must be. I mean, why not? It's scarce, it is hard to inflate (although that's a bit murky), and cultures have for some reason or the other given it value, which the "fair market" determines at any given point. 
A little background - my family is originally from the developing world, more specifically a nation that is prone to military coups, government seizures of bank accounts, times of free-falling currency, economic instability and corruption. Gold, surprise surprise, has always been considered a secure store of value. My mother (who is educated for her generation) is not tech savvy. She is not tech illiterate either, she can operate her smart phone and send/receive SMS/email etc. I tried explaining bitcoin to her and she was baffled, I dumbed it down, still baffled. I tried a different approach: mentionoed scarcity, fixed supply, "mining", and it being outside of the whims of central banks/governments and she immediately said "ah! like gold!". Her generation (and following gens) have simply just attributed value to gold simply "because". I am not saying these people are right or wrong, but I'm saying that because there's just a strong belief in gold being "valuable" - it has become so. I honestly don't see gold collapsing anytime soon for this reason. Furthermore - I think some people would tend to see bitcoin as a digital equivalent. 
But.. what do I know..
Edit: I forgot to mention remittances at all - which I think you touched on in reference to bank fees. I think there is potential in the remittance market as well. Although, that could technically work the same at $1,000/btc or $1/btc. It's a fast, instant, "email of money" kind of transfer system in my eyes. I have sent over $10k USD in bitcoin across the world instantly and had it confirm within 10 minutes, for.. pennies. But this doesn't speak to the value of bitcoin, more-so the protocol. However, if remittances are to be an area of potential success, wouldn't bitcoin have to have SOME value attributed to it? You can't remit $100 USD via a system where the tokens are worth $0 each.

Well, I pose you this: what *if* it does reach mainstream success? I don't mean the end-all-be-all, but develop it's own niche space, a la PayPal? Would that be so bad - especially since you *do* want the bitcoin experiment to continue on? And RE "investment pyramid collapse" I assume you mean the value/btc going to nothing(or next to nothing) - isn't it odd wishing for people to lose money? Now, my philosophy is probably different. If a friend of mine is sitting at a blackjack table and is up - I won't wish him anything but the best of luck. I wouldn't wish for him to lose his money. Personally, I got into bitcoin for the pure geekiness of it years ago.. so unless the value went to $3, I would probably not lose anything, although money comes and goes. If gold suddenly plummeted in value, what would your opinion on it be? (Positive, Angry, Neutral?). 
And then there's the off-chance the value might increase till it reaches some kind of FMV. We don't really know..

I think people need to realize that aside from pure speculation and gambling (which is totally fine if you're prepared to win AND LOSE), they have no utility. Bitcoin has first mover advantage and the infrastructure/investment/potential has gone way past the point of "um is this for real?". Yeah it's for real. Altcoins - no. For what? It doesn't even matter that litecoin doesn't have the same block size issues as bitcoin - the world settled in with bitcoin.. there is no "silver" to the "gold". These pump and dumps will continue to happen ad nauseum in altcoins. (Hell even in bitcoin, but less possible as things progress).

Son of Sam law. Can't profit off telling your 'story' if convicted. Although here's something funny - there are *multiple* for-profit projects underway that "tell" the Silk Road/DPR/Ross story. Hell, Fox is even producing one - screenplay being written by the same dude who wrote the Rolling Stone piece that became *Argo* (same guy who wrote that shitty Wired piece that glamorized a corrupt/rogue fed and made Ulbricbht look like Zuckerberg meets Escobar.) You can bet your ass that will be a multi million dollar picture with Robert Pattison  playing Ulbricbht etc. Even the corrupt fed got a $250k advance from Fox. Then there's other books, TV miniseries, and movies in the pipeline. All for profit.

Correct, banks talk about block chains and that's fine. That's a step. The awareness of distributed ledger has gotten into their psyche. I was referring not just to Dimons annual shareholder letter, but to his visible freak out during s video interview (maybe from Davos) where he noticeably got annoyed and kept saying governments wont allow bitcoin they won't allow it they just won't allow it, as if someone touched a nerve. Most people don't get worked up over something they don't give a shit about. Oddly, later that week he answered a panel question on bitcoin and did a cautious 180. Saying it's very interesting, it's a very unique settlement system, solves lots of issue with legacy wires and transfer systems etc. It was bizarre. My point is if someone like Dimon gets visibly worked up, and then flip flops,coupled with his shareholder letter that did not mention Bitcoin but SValley, you can safely assume bankers have Bitcoin on their radar. If anything , bankers are humans and like money. Aside from one instance of a manipulated bubble, it has been the best performing currency for the past 6 years straight. Nobody can deny that. Either you're underestimating "bankers" as not being hip to tech innovations, or underestimating Bitcoin. VCs are not putting billions into an ecosystem with their fuckyou money. They see something worthwhile and want to make money.

Yes, because people are change averse and when it comes to money incredibly sensitive to shaking up existing systems. But slowly things are changing.

That is absurd. I’ve heard of defamation/libel being stretched to its limits, but this seems to be Gwern fearing a *reverse* defamation lawsuit?! If true, Wright is blackmailing him to not retract a debunked theory... what the ever loving fuck?
So I can claim that Shesek is D.B. Cooper. Empirical evidence comes out that such would be impossible, say that Shesek was born years after Cooper jumped out of the plane with his loot. Shesek threatens to sue if I retract so I stay mum? 
IANAL but... this is not how the law works. Unless Gwern and Wright have some other unknown arrangement that would be subject to violation if he retracts.

What's dawning on me now is this whole thing has spiraled into something much darker, disturbing and dangerous. It's not about greg vs gavin (silly to even say that, and I happen to respect both immensely). Somewhere along the line things got VERy shady and characters have popped out of the woodwork to, I'm certain of it, sow discord *and* disrupt bitcoin development for personal, financial and political reasons.

Well I dont think it was ever solved. Judging by the reporting (no bodies ever found nor anyone with the supposed victims names existed) and sluething people were doing on reddit in those days, I *think* what happened was that the same scammer (redandwhite) pretended to be both the blackmailer, the hitmen, and the victims. Ironically some people figured out that the same person was also probably one of the largest SilkRoad Market scammers who ran off with a lot of money in the early days. Essentially that one person raped Ulbricht repeatedly.
I think the compromised/flipped mod was legimately undercover and not scamming. OTHER undercovers *were* scamming and blackmailing. (They got busted eventually). Essentially Ross Ulbrigt might have been a book smart kid but not street smart - was a scammers dream come true.

@_date: 2015-04-29 01:45:16
Well.... *kind of*. Now let me preface this by saying IANAL. And I also don't think Ross got a fair shake. (The Rogue Agents bullshit, the  blocking of witnesses, the character assassination with the murder-for-hire bullshit, the very obvious illegal warrantless hack of the server, and then the heart of the issue that the war on drugs is a farce). **But** - here's the problem (and I think it was a strategic blunder of epic proportions by his defense. Either that or it is some super evil genius Machiavellian tactical decision that will somehow help in his appeal): *if* Ross had claimed ownership of the servers **and** invoked his 4th amendment .. the **the jury would never have heard about the servers and all evidence gleaned from it!** I followed the case closely and a lot of legal minds were baffled because the Silk Road server evidence was clearly obtained through an illegal, warrantless hack. If Ulbricht claimed interest in it - the feds would have been fucked because they would have had to prove the search was legal, AND IF he also invoked his constitutional right to not self incriminate.. the prosecution wouldn't have been able to even ask him about it. And...yes, that would mean the jury would have not been privy to any of the evidence that came from the servers! If there is a lawyer in this thread that might have a different understanding of the law, please do shed light on it. But it seems as if Dratel screwed the pooch with this decision. The FBI very obviously broke the law and Tarbell almost certainly hacked the server. This was not news to the defense, and all Ulbricht would have had to do would have been to say *"Yeah, I have a material interest in that server. I'm a US Citizen. Can you please explain how you obtained access to it?"* and bada bing, the govt would have had to be very creative in their prosecution. Why do you think Tarbell didn't take the stand? So it is truly bizarre why Ross and his lawyers didn't admit to the server (which, ironically, he admitted to creating SR in the opening statement) AND invoke the 4th. The jury would have been none the wiser and we very well might have seen a different outcome. My personal feelings is that the defense overestimated the Rogue Agents fiasco and assumed once unsealed, the reek of corruption would touch the NY investigation as well. Unfortunately it was just the Baltimore investigation and the govt did not use anything from that dirty 'investigation' at trial. 
Regardless, I still think the judge's bias was very, very real and never missed an opportunity to give the defense a nut-tap. And the the Rogue Agents corruption scandal is so beyond the pale outrageous that at the very least the court should have granted Ulbricht a postponement pending the outcome of the grand jury investigation. Kinda sucks :(
@_date: 2015-09-30 06:17:37

I don't have to compromise my political and personal beliefs to simply *accept* a ludicrous story cooked up by a known liar/manipulator (Variety Jones). I am astonished people are simply reporting this as *news* now, just because he said so.

I often wonder what his motives are. He's not the average buttcoiner, he is rather smart and can often be extremely subtle/tactical in how he conveys a message. Other times he adjusts his delivery as to not seem like the average buttcoiner.
*Nobody* spends that much time thinking about, let alone memorializing in words long, technical, verbose statements and participating in discussion of something they are not interested in. Just on Reddit alone he's got hundreds if not thousands of comments and nearly 44,000 words - to put that in perspective that's nearly 100 pages. Not even counting forums and mailing lists.
Troll, he is not.

There is quite some irony here. Someone with an unhealthy obsession with something so much to the point they go an Internet frenzy? Ya don't say..
@_date: 2016-10-13 00:28:41
No no, I mean I totally agree. But the fact is that he's not some anonymous reddit r/buttcoiner whos either lost money in bitcoin or is annoyed they didn't get behind the technology or simply cant wrap their mind around a tech shift they disagree with. He's a very, very special kind of creature. *Anything* happens in bitcoin, and he's the first to post a thread in and then immediately rampage around r/btc and r/bitcoin with a psuedo calm, restrained, academic demeanor. But occasionally the seems come undone and he lets his anger or even hatred show  - even through his "tech speak". It's all good and fun when it's the average buttcoiner or burned trader.. but he's different. He's obsessed to the point that he wrote a lengthy comment in the SEC comment period of the ETF and on any day he's posting long missives in bitcoin subs. *IF* if it's just an unhealthy obsession I almost feel for the guy's family - how much time does he spend with them? Do they know he's literally posting thousands of comment on the Internet about something he doesn't like? How does he find time to fulfull his responsibilities at the university? Posting a lenghhty comment doesn't just take 10 minutes - there's thought, time, research etc involved. He either has to be online 20 hours a day **only focusing on bitcoin** or the man simply has found a way around the human need to sleep.     
 If it's *not* just an unhealthy obsession and there's something else involved, it's still rather sad. All this said, I still find the man intelligent. Time will tell.

Well I think my analogy is actually wrong. In the  movie Zaza is hated, loathed, but he's technically the "boss" since Michael Corleone has retired and gone legitimate. Nevertheless, when Michael calmly asks him what do you think about someone going around saying "fuck Michael Corleone" (clearly implying that would be playing with fire), Joey gets uncomfortable and lies and stoically states that such a person would be an enemy. He ends up sounding like a bitch. Michael puts him in his place without even saying much.
The only thing similar is that Theymos thinks he has any actual power (outside of the waning communities he mods), and he casually threatens to ban anything he wants - even actual giants like Coinbase and now Bitstamp. *"..yes, if Bitstamp were to do this, they would be banned."* He's gone full on delusional now and sounds silly. I guess that, plus he's also loathed.
Regardless, my analogy is technically incorrect. I find it funny though, so.. *shrug*

That's his whole schtick though - don't fall for it man. I used to think along those lines too but the closer you pay attention to his behavior the more sinister it becomes apparent. And this is a dangerous mindset - he is not a healthy skeptic. The problem is, IMO that because he's got a background in CS (I think?) and is in academia.. he provides these long winded commentaries (read: subtle attack poems) that are peppered with technical terms and concepts that most people simply don't have the ability to pick apart, so the assumption becomes that he's a smart fella who's a potential "convert". No no no. 
Bitcoin's mainstream success as a financial, technological, and perhaps even politically disruptive innovation is the ultimate test - not Jorge Stolfi.

Careful - this sounds like a bunch of nonsense. I don't know what in pluperfect hell is going on with Wright and what he did/didn't do in-front of Gavin &amp; Matonis. (Logic has it at some point Gavin will expand - I still do not think Gavin is an idiot nor is he involved in some nefarious scheme..and he himself on Twitter just deferred commenting on this for a while.) But I do not buy this. Joseph VaughnPerling is relevant to bitcoin because of what?
I've heard his name *maybe* a handful of times in the last 4 years (that I've been into bitcoin). I don't recall him ever being a prominent cryptographer or such. He claims he is.. and some cursory Googling show's a bunch of "stuff that seems like stuff", but in this day and age - Google your neighbor's name and there's probably enough bullshit online to make you think you're living next to a celebrity.
I have an extremely hard time taking a man who's Bitcointalk.org profile have the words [**"FREE MONEY!**" ALL IN CAPS and **HIGHLIGHTED IN YELLOW**]( followed by URLs in it seriously. I mean, c'mon... this individual is suddenly relaying messages from the trustee of Satoshi's coins' trust to Wright and acting as the main interlocutor between Wright and (what I'm assuming is to mean) former associates/beneficiaries of people who were working together to create one of the most brilliant pieces of technology?
Good God.. life was actually simpler when bitcoin was a fringe technology before the crazies and riff-raff got into it. The most curious thing was reading a small Satoshi post on BCT, or fuck, a Dread Pirate Roberts post. 
Now we have (no offense to the site or dude who conducted this interview): bitcoinmagazine.com presents: ramblings of a madman!

Hey Greg - can you expand on what you mean by "attacking"? I understand if you can't divulge exact language for privacy, but can you shed more light on this? Seems odd to attack an individual in a 1sheet being given to press, for any reason. 
Edit: Nevermind - I saw your other comment and re-read the article in the Economist. I'm assuming this is what you mean:
*"In an article in the press kit accompanying the publication of his blog post, he takes aim at Gregory Maxwell, one of the leading bitcoin developers, who first claimed that the cryptographic keys in Mr Wright’s leaked documents were backdated. “Even experts have agendas,” he writes, “and the only means to ensure that trust is valid is to hold experts to a greater level of scrutiny.”*

I'm not convinced Wright doesn't actually *possess* a key to be honest. How he might have access to one.. I have no clue. I have a few theories, but I do not know. I don't believe Gavin is lying about what he saw, and I find it very unlikely he was the victim of several social engineering/hacks all working in sync. He (Gavin) also suggested in addition to what he's disclosed, he's privy to private conversations and information that makes him feel certain beyond a reasonable doubt about what he feels. Gavin is not some dubious agitator, nor is he what most people would call dumb. 
CW very well might have access to a key and other information. How and why he has it.. I've yet to see a satisfactory or clear explanation. You mentioned stolen keys.. hm.. now that's a thought...
@_date: 2016-05-04 21:47:50


I will check that out, I did skim.


Agree.. although if someone tries hard enough, they could theoretically explain away each of the dodgy pieces (backdating, omission of mention that the Sartre message verifies nothing,etc). But I see your point, as should any logical person who's lived in society.


This is interesting. I assume the press shies away from quoting your view because it isn't sexy enough. Although ironically it's a very bold statement - and I agree. I'm sure it would make for interesting reading, but I don't see how the identity would change the fundamentals of the technology. Politics, sure, but not the 1's and 0's. Like if Prometheus came forward and proclaimed he gave mankind fire.. ok, but.. it certainly wouldn't matter to the field of chemistry or science, let alone a candle. Unless it's for accolades.. which makes this whole situation uneasy.

@_date: 2016-05-06 04:41:33


I'm sorry, but that is just as definitive as saying "he has a key". You (or I) do not know this either way. You were not there. You could be right.. but you're saying it as if that's an absolute, and it's just not man. 


Gavin is certainly not an idiot, and you know this Rydan. His academic and professional work in computer science, mathematics and cryptography are not what reasonable people consider to be that of an idiot. If you felt Gavin was an idiot *before* this circus, then that's your opinion and certainly you have a right to it.. no matter what your criteria for an intellectually disabled person is. If Gavin is an idiot *because* of this - then that's flawed logic. Bad judgement, though? You bet. 


Again, unless you were there you don't know this. Very little of what occurred in that room (and privately) has been divulged by Gavin. (Same goes for w/Matonis and the three media outlets). Either because of the NDA, because of the debacle of Wright reneging, or for personal reasons. I have a feeling at some point an exact breakdown of what occurred in Gavin's verification meeting with Wright will come out - NDA or not. 


Of course not. And this is in invalid comparison. If I go to a magic show, it's to be entertained - because I know that "magic" is **impossible**. Fun to watch, and on occasion impressive, but I know that things are being stage managed, there's an entire apparatus supporting the illusionists feats, and I might theorize on how he performed a certain trick, but I know the entire spectacle is based on something scientifically impossible. Cryptographic signatures &amp; validation **are not scientifically impossible**. That said - even having possession of the key(s) and being able to sign a provided message doesn't mean Wright = Satoshi. And clearly there is a lot of fuckery involved in this entire saga. 
There a lot of unknowns in all of this. Who's decision was it to use Electrum? That's important. Who chose which model of PC was to be purchased/furnished by Wright's assistant? That's very important. Gavin has said he was ["convinced..the hardware and software had not been tampered with."]( What else was discussed and shown to Gavin in private that he's so far refused to disclose but has indicated it also lent to his certainty? That's also important. 
It's unfair to come down on Gavin as being an idiot and to make other definitive statements when we were not privy to what took place. I'm sure we will be at some point.. and that might answer a lot of the unknown variables. But until then...¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Then as a lawyer you would indeed know that bitcoin is central to this entire case. The various ways in which bitcoin transactions occur, wallet files are stored/transferred/the blockchain works is beyond what most (probably all) jurors would have much of an idea about. Andreas has merit on the topic of bitcoin - he has authored a book on it, published articles, participated in 100s of speaking engagement on the topic, consulted and been employed by several high profile bitcoin based companies, and has been called to testify before the Canadian Senate. Are you suggesting he's not an expert? Or that a layperson (jury member) should have sufficient understanding of bitcoin based on .. reasons. Or based on govt witness testimony?

My mother, who I've been trying to explain bitcoin to for over two years now (try explaining the blockchain and wallets in half-English half-foreign language to a woman in her 60's) was glued to the screen and wants a Circle account on her iPhone *tonight*. My brother in law (an IT entrepreneur who's dismissed btc in the past as an 'interesting experiment that will probably not evolve beyond fringe use cases') texted me "Damn. You watching CNN? Let's talk tomorrow." And my significant other who's probably sick of hearing about bitcoin since I've hounded her about it told me it was fantastic and really interesting to watch. These are just 3 examples of people who don't live and breathe like most of us, appreciating and understanding the benefits of this tech. I'm sure there are millions of others.

And then the judge told the defense to call a witness of their own if they want to elicit certain testimony she blocked them from getting in cross-examination (which is weird.. because the burden of proof and all that). They call witnesses (per her suggestion), to be told **No**? ..Wut?

Well yeah.. I mean.. sure. But like I said.. I don't think anyone imagined this case to be deliberated for days and days and be like *"12 Angry Men"* in the jury room. It was kind of obvious the defense was getting slammed, and some of the evidence was just *TOO* damning (personally I have my suspicions - but this isn't a tinfoil thread. It is what it is). An educated guess would have been that the verdict would have came back today, or tomorrow. Had it been tomorrow, and the BitLicense regs came out today - it would have seemed like they had "inside knowledge" of the jury. I think the NYFDS just thought it's a fair assumption/chance that today's timing would work out overall for reasons only they know. If anything - they had promised Jan and we're 4 days past that.. and Lawsky kept getting this question.

RE citation - will find it. Was in the transcripts, but also was reported by many media outlets specifically (presumably for the Judge's use of such a term).
I read the Judge's order and clearly she's far more versed then I am in jurisprudence. That's why she's a federal judge and I am not. I'm sure she knows what she is doing.
And in response to defense playing games with the court - that's a matter of perception. One can say the same for the prosecution. They have changed witnesses, and introduced exhibits last minute. They also did not release the witness list till the weekend before trial start date for fear the alleged (Ulbricht) would order hits on them from jail (where he has no access to a computer or a phone).
In any case.. I suppose it's relative. I'm not in that court room, most of us aren't. We can only go by the transcripts and news reports that come out every day or so. Judging by *those*, IMHO it appears the Judge has a pro-govt bias. Perhaps she's the fairest judge to ever sit on the bench - I personally doubt it.

Out of curiosity - what would be your standard of proof in this situation? Not necessarily if Wright is or isn't SN (or has had some access to *some* of SN's keys or private information, either by virtue of being/being involved with/illicitly obtained) - but what would somebody have to be able to do **publicly** in order for you to feel comfortable that they were at some point the person(s) who invented bitcoin? And more importantly - would you even care?
Personally I am not not convinced Wright is Satoshi, but I'm also not convinced he's not. Although as a user (certainly not a developer or contributor like yourself) - the basic technology behind bitcoin wouldn't change. As in, it's not like somebody being verified as Satoshi would imply that the technology itself is in danger, and my bitcoins are no longer secured by cryptography.

Fully agreed. I'm talking about the motions, objections etc. It appears that the Court has been trigger happy with sustaining prosecution objections, while overruling almost every single defense objection.
You feel, overall (regardless of the btc aspect of this trial), Judge Forrest has treated both sides with absolute impartial conduct? 
Also - do you think Ulbricht taking the stand might score defense any points? I feel like there's not much of a chance of him getting a "not guilty" and Dratel (who is arguably not an incompetent attorney) is point scoring for an appeal. However, there's that slim chance (the "OJ/Case Anthony Effect" where the jury doesn't understand what 'reasonable doubt' entails, and also there's quite a bit of confusion in the technology that might lead to reasonable doubt). Bottom line, you think Ulbricht will/should take the stand? And what kind of odds do you give on an acquittal?
Thanks for taking the time to answer. Always interesting having a lawyer provide insight.

This is stupid. Why stop at bitcoin? **CLAMP DOWN ON THE INTERNET!** That way *so many scams* will stop happening. The real evil here is the Internet.
How about the lawmakers 'clamp down' on the people who were running this? They'd be consider thieves. Doesn't make fuckall difference if its bitcoin or any other kind of currency. Anything *guaranteeing*  insanely high returns on an investment is a scam, there's no such thing as a guaranteed return.
I hope Grace's husband clamps down on her ass most of all. Mortgaged their home?!
*"A middle-aged woman, who identified herself as Grace, said she had re-mortgaged her apartment to invest HK$ 1.6 million with MyCoin to realize her dream of setting up her own company.

Well yeah but then .. legal shit. Think about it, its on thing to have a member infiltrate staff to help nail the 'mastermind'. It's another to *become* the mastermind and run the illegal site like nothing's happened. At that point, the government would directly be operating a DNM. Not even a honeypot - (well maybe a honeypot), but they would be allowing an illegal narcotics conspiracy to thrive and run on auto-pilot (with a little help from agents posing as DPR). Drugs would pass through the system into the hands of buyers/dealers. Money would be made and laundered etc. Seems like it would end up biting them in the ass.
Imagine some 13 year old kid buys an 8ball off the SR that was being run by the feds, OD's and dies. His parents get a lawyer, and when it comes to light the *government* was running the site - guess who they sue?
Too complex.

Yep.. it is definetly something I'm sure they considered and probably had internal opinions and attorneys look at. Grabbing it and knocking it offline is a political coup and blah blah blah, the streets are safer, the children are safer, blahbity blah. But keeping it running to catch some high profile traffickers would have had more of a net win, but with potential to get raped if something went wrong. I guess it's a complex situation and most importantly, *unprecedented* so they went the old fashioned route of "freeze! hands move!". Or I guess in this case "freeze! don't encrypt!".

Incorrect. There's a logo for Bitcoin payment @ Microsoft's checkout page. There's a reason it doesn't have the "bitcoin logo" with a parentheses saying ("but really USD"). It doesn't matter what happens on the backend, if there's any conversion to USD or British Pounds or Euros or whatever.
Your logic is akin to saying "I wish people would stop saying XYZ merchant accepts check/credit cards. They don't, that's an illusion. It's USD."

Viruses and ransomware have existed since before bitcoin and would do the same thing except you'd have to Western Union or Moneygram someone in Russia or Nigeria. The fact that the hackers have moved to bitcoin is nothing spectacular to be honest.. it's just a sign of the evolving tech landscape.
Regardless, I personally found this funny. Data that is kept on the same machine is not a backup... it's.. just the data, twice. I can see this police department has the brightest infosec gurus in the entire state. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:49:32
Exactly my thinking. $137k now is great, but what will I do with it (other then re-invest) that I'n not currently capable of doing on my salary? Letting it stay in BTC however, presents the possibility of not only it most likely gaining value over time, but possibly even day trading and catching some huge swings with all this volatility. And like that line in the "Social Network" - .."..a million dollars isn't cool. you know what's cool? a billion dollars". Same philosophy, give or take a 0.

Ok.. "us" vs "them" is exactly why people see BTC as fringe and a means to peddle child porn, terrorism, drugs and devil worship. This is the problem. If Ron Paul and Snoop Dogg talk pro Bitcoin.. it's all good. But if Apple were to allow BTC wallets on their devices.. we wouldn't want them? Yes we would. Isn't that the point? To change the old way and move forward? Apple might have a stake in the old way, but Apple's demographic is always geared towards the "next gen" and "starting trends". You think Apple has a stake in diligently making sure the Bank of America and PNC and Wells Fargo etc apps are superior and hip? Does that appeal to 15 year old text-message (iMsg now) junkies who chat all day about Twilight? Fuck no. They want to capture the market young. And young means staying ahead of the next guy. So doing things the old way is definitely not what they (at least) pretend to do. How their internal bureaucracy works I have no idea.. but I know they're constantly trying to come out with the next big thing. I see nothing bigger then Bitcoin on the horizon.

I thought even less then $10k gets deposit at the bank's discretion as a possible CTR. But then that might just be for cash. Wire's should have less rules since there's a paper trail and it's not shady.
But regardless, I can't avoid the IRS be it in a $10k increment or $30k increments. I don't like taxes anymore then the next guy.. but I definitely don't like prison, which tax evasion would get me, so yeah, would consult a CPA before doing so.

That's the point. This guy gets it. Detach your emotion. Don't go too insane looking at charts and tickers... I was locked out of a wallet by own fuckery for nearly a year.. and that essentially FORCED me to detach myself (literally!). And has BTC grown in every sense in 11 months? Yes.

@_date: 2013-12-09 20:55:14
Hell yes. I'm holding on for dear life.
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:27:41
Absolutely agreed. And honestly, taking short term gains might very well be someone's livelihood (day traders).. so I don't hold anything against that. But I do think that if you focus too much on 6 hour candlesticks and charts and the Anti BTC Bitter Brigade.. you'll lose sight of the bigger picture. Things take time to mature, to grow. Justin Bieber will probably still be "sorta cool" to a certain crowd 50 years from now. The Beatles played in shitty pubs night after night before they "exploded", and then changed history. Nevertheless, all great things grow exponentially. 
1 guy tells all 5 of his friends, all 5 of his friends tell 5 of their friends, so on and so forth.
History is littered with such examples. If people actually think that Visa/Mastercard, Paypal, Bank wires and inflationary fiat is the best we humans can do.. then they're vastly underestimating the world's collective IQ and knowledge of history. I remember when "email" was something the majority of people thought was too complicated and would rather write a letter. I have relatives in their 80s who now routinely use Gmail, on their iPhones, via WIFI.
Food for thought.

Wasn't "Bitcoin" the most Googled term recently? It's the single technology that's being discussed on everything from cable news to technology magazines to financial journals, blogs, to the U.S. Senate!
I'm not in his shoes. But if I was, I'd be looking towards the future and how to jump ahead of the competition and not hop on a bandwagon after the fact. At some point, Bitcoin probably will be come mainstream (either it will or it won't at all.. and I'll bet it will).. and Apple is as mainstream as it gets. 
I'm not suggesting they open up their walled garden App Store. But their posture is discouraging and quite frankly bizarre. Send him an email man, cmon..I'll buy you a beer.

Well it might come to that. But what if Apple did 180 and incorporated BTC into their iWallet or whatever it is they're working on? Or at least relaxed rules in the Developers section of the App Store to Coinbase, Blockchain, Gliph etc didn't get such shit treatment as if they were peddling porn instead of bitcoin wallets?

I understand what you're trying to say, but I respectfully disagree. Your sentence "Sounds like a lot of effort for something they really won't care about." I'm POSITIVE people said that about BITCOIN itself (to Satoshi or early adopters) in the beginning, right?

Any experiencing  receiving wires from either? Also, would I have to report any wire over $10K (no, since it's not cash, I'm assuming)? Or at least tell my bank in advance.
And the million dollar question.. TAXES?! And this is all theoretical based on if I even want to 'cash out' any BTC at this point..

Yeah but parents giving me "gifts" in the forms of wires from Coinbase or Bitstamp? Would that fly? And come to think of, it I "give" these BTC to my parents, who in turn do "gift" them legitimately to me at some point (and not much.. maybe 10k or so).. I'm sure that'd be perfectly kosher?

I said I understand their approach, not that I'm comfortable with it. I don't feel comfortable getting pulled over for speeding either, and I'd rather get away with it.. but if I get pulled over because a cop is watching.. that's his right to ticket me. It's not all black and white man. I'm cool with having a rooted Android, the latest linux distro, only using open source software, and all that shit.. but life sometimes operates in a grey area. I use an iPhone because for me it's convenient. A lot of the people in my field and personal life use iMessage.. and that syncs across all devices. Additionally, I'm in a creative field so the options for non Apple software suck for what I do. I'm not anti Apple. I fucking love some of their products. I also hate some of their policies. Like this hardon they have for Bitcoin. So I'm at least trying to do something about it. @ the end of the day, my BTC and my appreciating for it's disruptive technology are worth way more then all my Apple gear combined.. so if it came down to a choice.. Apple would not receive my business. But like I said. I don't like Safari, so I use Chrome. 
Therefore, why can't I use BTC apps with an iPhone? It's not a stretch.

Dude, that is awesome. And that's freakishly similar to the email I sent Cook. You posted this on the 9th? Does that mean you blogged it or you actually emailed him on the 9th?
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:36:54
No doubt. Not a huge fan of taxes, but even less of a fan of prison, so will absolutely need to do my research on that before I do anything. But anyways, I don't plan to "cash out" .. so I'm guessing there's nothing to report/taxable until/if I ever do. I actually believe in this silly Internet funny-money!
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:08:43
man I don't even think November 2012 is considered "early" is it? On the bitcointalk forums (and even in this subreddit), I've seen guys who've been into BTC since the beginning. I thought I was late to the party.
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:19:00
when the appropriate time comes, I will rip the eyelids off and put together my deterministic seed. by that time, I'll be able to afford a new pair of eyelids. maybe even designer.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:08:29
I will. The former. :)
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:27:50
fuck yes. I was panic holding by default for a year. Now it's going to be by choice.
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:07:53
Thanks. No shit! Nobody knows except my significant other, parent, and this entire Reddit sub. Shhh..
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:01:01
why not? there's some very sound advice I've come across here. to each their own..
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:03:12
HAHA! A bad memory could actually be a blessing and not a curse. Here's the rub - had I not just written this off and completely nearly forgotten about it.. I'd probably have spent them or sold @ some point. 
Good thing Silk Road is shut down. That was a joke.
But seriously, it's probably a massive blessing in disguise. 
Again, not even in the same level as the Norwegian dude.. but I'm assuming had he gotten ahold of his BTC before now.. he'd have sold/used them before they were the million. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:09:00
That's what I'm hearing.. Armory and Electrum. Weighing my pro's and cons. I'm not anti linux.. and I'm actually comfortable in a linux environment. But wondering if it's really necessary to get a laptop with the sole purpose of installing Ubuntu and a BTC client. Why no love for macs :(
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:04:18
My man :)
What's to lose? tcook
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:50:52
i know, i'm gonna do that today.. i'm just nervous sending 170 btc at once :-/   .. after a year of having this shitty feeling, you tend to consider yourself a poster child for Murphy's Law!
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:55:45
yeah.. I've never posted any images. (no screen shots ever worth posting till this!!) . should I edit the OP?
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:06:57
Not unless they accept BTC or until I convert BTC to fiat. In fact, they owed me, and I used that tax refund last year to fund the initial BTC purchase. Thank you IRS!
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:41:10
Believe me I am not wise. I'm a hazard to myself. But if your gut tells you something is going to be revolutionary.. it's hard not to take a small chance and vest yourself. I'm no mathematician, economist, developer or investment advisor. I don't have the vision Steve Jobs or Alexander Bell did. But I've got a gut and I go with it. To quote Hyman Roth from Godfather II, when I first really looked into Bitcoin and studied it, I had a "Michael, we're gonna be bigger then U.S. Steel" moment.
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:41:53
hmm. fair enough. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:07:26
Who's they? All the prediction I've been hearing/reading is that this is just beginning. We haven't even seen the influx of new money (conscience decision to invest &gt; getting verified at an exchange &gt; wiring in fiat &gt; purchasing BTC ) as a result of last Monday's Senate "lovefest".. and that's just average joe's like us. When "big money" (Wall Street, Investment bankers etc) starts slowly moving in due to inevitable investor pressure.. the writing is on the wall man. "They" are wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:59:51
What if I'm using lots of iDevices? I have to switch an entire phone? The last time I tried installing Chrome on my Macbook Pro (or iPhone), I didn't get a big red STOP sign. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:11:49
very cool. I'll look into that. what goes around comes around, and I'm definitely a "pay it forward" kinda person. checking out Seansoutpost right now.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:39:50
.. or everything else via Gyft.com. And with Target now on the bandwagon.. I can even stock up on loaves of bread, milk, and eggs (what every econ class teaches us are the most important/tangible economic instruments in existence).
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:46:31
I've got a pretty well paying job.. so thankfully not dependent on anyone. No student loans either.. I worked through college + parents helped me out. I'm going to look into Roth IRA's for sure. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:47:56
Pretty sure.
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:13:27
No idea..ok that's bullshit, it feels good. But money comes and goes (or gets devalued by inflation).. so Bitcoin OTOH, is a different story. I'm not going to be rooting for it more then ever.. and watching it gain strength against fiat currencies.
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:38:07
Thank you. I've got my eyes on you focker ;)
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:57:11
So? They have Safari, and allow Chrome as well. I don't care if they're creating their own digital currency and I hope it does well. I won't be using it, just like I don't use Safari, I use Chrome. But I'd like the ability to at least be able to choose, right?
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:00:07
that's what my girl said actually. and that'd only be like what, 1.5 BTC right? wouldn't even make a dent
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:38:19
Very true, but right now people are using their credit cards for in-app purchases.. forcing (or "allowing") Apple to charge an extra 3% in credit card processing fees. Right? But if BTC was an option, they'd be able to pass that 3% back to buyer (like Gyft) and look like knights in shining armor. They'd still make what they were gonna make anyways. OR, they could continue their pricing model and charge the same prices (and NOT give the 3% discount ... and make even MORE MONEY, which is what corporations are in existence for, because they wouldn't be paying the CC fee, only a minuscule miners fee). Does that make sense?
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:35:25
rightly so. lots don't. it's in the infancy stage.. which is mind boggling. imagine when it's "mainstream" for real. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:32:27
totally. but I tend to avoid coulda/shoulda/woulda and focus more on the future. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:21:51
Tell you what guys. Steve Jobs, and now even Tim Cook, has made it known that they (or at least their assistant pretending to be them) actually respond to emails directly once in a while. Let's all email Apple's CEO and let him know how this is a bad idea and that Apple needs to go back to being the visionary company they once were. 
Email address: tcook
Seriously. Email him. He can't ignore hundreds of emails on the same topic. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:05:36
Dave - had I known about you, and had I even remembered my BTC balance, I'm sure I would have. Cost vs. Benefit.. I'm sure anything you charge would have been worth it. I'm curious, do you recover based on just brute dictionary? Or someone like me would say "well I'm nearly positive it's similar to this, or contains these words for sure" etc and that would narrow it down and I'm nearly positive adding characters such as "!" would be amongst what you'd have done, correct?
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:54:13
good luck!
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:17:36
keep trying man. And try variants. Definetly one with a "!" or some character tacked on. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:37:28
No. Didn't do anything but move them offline into cold storage and this time tattooed the password into the inside of my eyelids. I think they're worth order of magnitudes more then $150k. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:52:40
ohyeah man I just made several backups ,changed the password, double checked those backups.. and still I'm paranoid!
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:15:03
You spent considerable amount of time analyzing my post.. I'm slightly flattered. 
Two observations:
1) If reddit is a circle jerk and a lie..and you are here... which of the two is your activity of choice?
2) You spent above avg time "dissecting" a post at the wrong places. Nevertheless, you deserve something for your efforts. Would you like a bitcointip? 
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:13:59
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:52:07
Makes me feel like a little part of me dies every time I see the BTC price go down on the ticker. But then I feel like its Christmas when the price swings up a bit. I need to stop looking at it's ticker and let BTC do it's (inevitable) thing and all will be good.
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:35:07
And if Apple implemented it, and suddenly hundreds of million people now have default Bitcoin wallets on their phones.. thereby forcing them to at least somewhat understand what BTC is.. you wouldn't care? You wouldn't want that? You'd prefer Bitcoin to be tucked away into one corner of the internet on Reddit, Bitcointalk, IRC and sensationalist articles regarding bubbles and silk road? come on dude. think.
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:04:44
Still time brother. $800/btc is going to seem like peanuts in a few weeks/month/year. $266 was HOLY SHIT?!??! remember? $266/BTC now seems unimaginable.. show the wife this reddit post, and she will understand. Trust me. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:06:58
thank you man. what about brain wallets? no good?
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:30:48
well I wasn't able to do anything with them for nearly a year. since I got my wallet access back? I've put them offline in cold storage. What's life changing is seeing something that was fringe/nerdy make headlines everyday. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:56:07
I actually did mention that, as well as point out that Cook being a smart man himself, surely understands the natural synergy that lays within iOS devices and virtual currency storage/payment. Don't underestimate the guy.. he's no Jobs.. but he's not a functional retard either.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:20:29
Hey SeansOutpost - thank you for that. I'll be reading up on you guys today. Expect a donation by tonight.
@_date: 2013-11-25 05:59:24
Thanks for all the awesome advice and energy people. Much appreciated it. Other then PM's asking me to to Skype (yeah, I know, get my IP address and all that) and asking me to pay off debt (sorry, if I'm going to help out anyone with their debt its probably going to be close relatives) or fund someone's startup business.. I've gotten a shitton of helpful ideas and advice. Some of you I'll be shooting a PM about regarding offline wallets and/or investment strategies you've posted.
And sorry guys, no hookers and blow for me tonight. But did go to a nice restaurant AND ordered appetizers and dessert. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:28:20
I'm not broke.. so I'm thinking I could get by another year. You think BTC will go up a lot in another year? I honestly do think so.
RE: paying attention.. you sir, have no idea how much attention I'm going to be paying going forward! :)
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:59:05
just changed it. good looking out.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:12:25
That's exactly my point. Had I not forgotten the password and not just written it off (and to be honest.. I forgot how much I even had after a while. I had the math skewed and thought I had like "50 or so bitcoins lost forever" since I completely gave up last year and put the wallet on a USB and an external drive). Had I known the balance and my password.. I'd have been very tempted to "sell" in April. I mean, holy shit, $266!!! right? ;)   Or I'd have been tempted to try one of those wallet recovery services or something. Either way, forgetting the "!" variant of the passphrase turned out to be probably the biggest favor of my self-fuckery. And believe me, theres be a lot of fuckery over this quarter century.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:34:17
noted. thanks. will bitcointip once I figure out how to :)
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:26:25
What about the goddesses? If we're going full on Charlie Sheen and all
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:03:46
You don't have to beg. You can just ask them why they're being un-accomodating towards Bitcoin wallets and applications? Don't say pretty please. Ask for an answer.
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:26:55
yeah, what'd be wrong with that? I'd be down with it. Not for my main BTC stash.. which would remain in cold storage.. but for every day transactions.. why the fuck not?! Sure would make life convenient. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:56:36
Omg. Is SgtFuckface - LtShitBrick aka Reality4U? 
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:57:57
Sounds like good post-shart protocol. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:07:38
Not a bad idea. But again.. just holding off a bit more.. lets say 1 year.. there's a possibility I might be able to just straight out buy a house outright (or put down half the value) if BTC continues on it's trajectory to the moon 
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:02:51
furfighter - thanks for getting the point. I know that to a lot, Apple has already lost it's luster and Android is the end all. I'm not averse to making the switch either.. and if this kind of stuff keeps up, I will "vote with my wallet" as another poster said and move out of the Apple ecosystem. But it's not that easy. The nature of my career requires me to use Macs and Apple products in both my professional and personal device and a lot of them must sync. Having everything streamlined just makes sense.. I'm not 19 years old anymore where I have all the time in the world to be testing shit out and being rebel with out a cause. Apple is not evil. They're out to SCREW us over or destroy Bitcoin. They just have their own ideas. But we pay their salaries, we are there bottom line. And most likely the demographic that use non PC/Windows products (Mac, Linux, Android etc) are the same demographic who are the early adopters of Bitcoin. (Yes, we're all early adopters at this point.. it's not mainstream YET). If they find that there's a need for something, and they can implement it seamlessly and make it look like it was there idea (as if we give a shit that Apple were credit Redditors for getting them to go easy on Bitcoin wallets/apps!) and they even find a way to profit somehow.. I'm sure they might explore the idea if they haven't already.
I really appreciate your post. And as a few emails have trickled in, it's possible he's even take a little detour to r/bitcoin and seen all the strong sentiment (in this thread and dozens before it). 
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:39:09

@_date: 2013-11-25 19:50:31
Around 170ish if I recall. Maybe 172? I don't recall exactly. But I didn't use any, if at all.
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:03:03
this reddit account? kind of, yeah. mostly just used to lurk. I don't use this handle anywhere else online, and I'm using a VPN so I think I'm fine. But definitely not Skyping with the legion of people who suddenly have something very important to tell me on Skype.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:30:39
Thank you. Well I DO have some BTC related business ideas.. had them for a while. Remittance services etc. And some apps. I doubt this would be enough to fund anything significant. I'd have to wait a while to at least be on part with that Norwegian guy. I'm like his American, less exciting, long lost cousin
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:41:08
Do banks have problems with wires exceeding $10,000? Shouldn't, right? It's not like depositing $10,000 in grimy 20's, 10's and 5's
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:21:21
I feel you. Never had so many strangers suddenly wanting to Skype me. Perverts, all of 'em.
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:51:50
thanks dude.. and yes.. sorry, i'm a guy.
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:57:27
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:35:55
thanks buddy.. and yes.. I don't feel like a million bucks yet. I feel like I might feel like that in a year or so. and this time I'm not forgetting the password!
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:18:24
Thank you. I wouldn't say it was courageous.. some might even call it high risk. I think I really just saw the implications of what Bitcoin (and it's protocol) might have on the future.. and took a gamble more or less.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:56:08
1 by 1.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:51:01
How do you ban something that has no central point of authority? You'd have to "ban" the Internet entirely.. considering BTC is based on p2p technology.
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:53:06
thank you very much. what kind of donations?
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:16:12
thank you !
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:03:37
but then wouldn't taking out that $20-30k make the climb to $1.2m or $1.5m a lot steeper/take more time? (sorry I'm still mildly hungover from last night and mildly in shock to think logically.. excuse my fuzzy math)
and is BTC really on a trajectory to go 10x it's current value? yes, right? please say yes
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:49:54
sorry, was the first thing then popped up in google!

@_date: 2013-11-25 19:54:46
I pretty much did :)
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:11:09
Totally agreed.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:15:19
Amazed how many people are sending me personal messages wanting to Skype. I don't, and I won't.
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:33:38
You seem like the kind of guy who'll know what to do with a dollar bill. 
Here. +$1
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:54:48
Awesome. Cook will have to respond to SOMEONE.
