I used the coinbase app after numerous failed attempts on GDAX. It didn't work. I have tried the coinbase website, and they are not budging on verification. Tried Gemini, same deal (it's been a month and 5 days). Got approved on Bitstamp after just a few days, but since I don't have a bank account in Europe, it's not really worth it to use right now. I just logged onto Coinbase, because I AM registered and bought a tiny amount of bitcoin over a month ago just to test the system and everything. I have my bank info on there/ am not just using a card, etc... and I just put in a random number to see what coinbase would charge me, because in all honesty, the fee page is a complete clusterf@ The language on that page is more convoluted than any other site I have looked at so far concerning the fees. Now, despite me having bank account info in the system, it wanted to charge me 4% for a 50$ purchase of bitcoin (I thought that was just card purchases according to some sites that try to clarify coinbase fees, since coinbase is incapable of doing so) ... and I wouldn't buy bitcoin that way if I was really intending to buy more than a nominal amount. I would move it into my US$ wallet first to have it ready to buy at a price I like. 51 dollars was also 4%. However, 52 was putting the fee at 5.75%. That makes no damn sense. Obviously, that makes me very hesitant to continue with coinbase at all, because if I move dollars into my wallet, I have no real way of knowing what I'm about to be charged and whether or not I will be able to get it back out after testing the waters concerning buy/sell of bitcoin. . . because the fee page appears to be a giant crock of $ unless someone cares to explain the mystery to me. I have no idea where they get these fees from, and am seriously starting to thinking there is something very dodgy going on with a site that I thought was legit, just too expensive to actually use.
