Nice. I'm in another Ontario town and just saw my first "Bitcoin accepted here" sign in town.

Ya very normal in TO. Many here protest oppression of those who practice Falun Gong.

At this point I don't even bother trying to explain it to people.  Too many times i've had people ask me to explain, and then they just scoff at me.  Rather annoying at this point.  If they ask, I tell them to research and build their own opinion.

Lmao fair point, fair point.

As a game developer, this is great.

Your using the term "crash" extremely loosely. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 12:47:59
Dem real gains. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:36:59
Fears of a crash? I think we can call it a crash. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:49:22
In my opinion yes. But not an "expert". 
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:24:42
Good for you man!

Being able to simply walk into an exchange and have 1 on 1 direct seems cool. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:35:10
Agreed. He's comical with informative news about the crypto scene.

Another old man banker against Bitcoin.  Nothing new.

Will people still be able to use a debit card from them to purchase? Or wire transfer?

Always cringe when I see Ripple in the same pic as BTC and ETH.

Lol if Americans think they live in "the land of the free" they are more delusional than I thought.  
@_date: 2018-07-31 11:48:15
Lol. We are far more free than our dirty diaper to the South.

Would be cool to have desktop wallpaper that was this but would update whenever a new node would open. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:12:09
This is cool. Maybe dumb question, but when I tip, where are the satoshis coming from and how to a specify where they go? Do I have to make an account somewhere?
