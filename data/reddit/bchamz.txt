I worked for Sergei and MMM for the last month providing help to people across the globe. The system works and MMM GLOBAL could truly change the world. I also have found cutting back on masturbation benefits in my life but if I go too long it loses its helpful effects. I'm beefing up now packing on pounds so LET'S PREPARE FOR SUCCESS !
@_date: 2014-12-06 17:55:36
that's my thought- good point- spread the knowledge- spread the coin- here is $2 on me @_date: 2014-11-24 15:19:47
Posts like this I enjoy screaming my favorite song too  It goes "One little chicken...!" I listen to Bashar everyday and quit my job today to stand like a tree and fire breathe!   FOLLOW THE HEN TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2014-11-07 08:43:03
Good thought $1.00
@_date: 2014-11-07 15:46:02
 I'd love to stop by...how many NYC restaurants have you paid with using bitcoin...? Are they popping up quite nicely. Good work.... $1.00 
@_date: 2014-11-07 08:25:38
Great idea. Signed up-sent $4.50 to my change tip wallet...sending it out to two different people in two different cultures. So easy to sign up and set a little in your wallet. Love this idea. Fully support it.
@_date: 2014-11-23 05:11:06
I really believe helping the everyday worker have faith and understand bitcoin is going to take us to get the knowledge on the streets. I like your posts.
@_date: 2014-10-10 21:53:20
Once this catches on for the everyday working man sending money home.... BOOM!!!!!
@_date: 2014-11-22 17:51:21
This is where were at- we got a winning product-its time to let the people know that are sending money "back home" every paycheck. And yes at first you could debate- "Is it really saving money when considering the initial buy in fees on exchanges-but once set-up-it is in my opinion that the average worker in my country (US) would be saving anywhere from $20 to $75 a month. Just shooting from the hip on the numbers BUT THE POINT REMAINS THE SAME. The workers need to know its a great unique system-and if it could save a family $200-$500 a year....then let's take the time to get these flyers out. I will be printing some-I'm truly at the point where I feel inspired by bitcoin-damn near obsessed with it. I live in Texas at the moment-previously New Mexico and California-immigrants need to know this alternative. I've also traveled the world and been STUCK waiting on Western Union. This system works-anyone reading this who feels the same-make 100 flyers. That's what I will be doing today. Flyers will be distributed where workers send money home!

Ext-Late Night- Bangkok, Thailand- Street Bar Dimly Lit-
Man: Honey- where is your purse?
Woman: It was right.... there?"
Man: Does it have our checks and cash in there- do you have any of it on you?
Woman: No-just what we left at the hotel.
Man- Ok- don't panic-
Camera zooms to restaurant neon sign
"Bitcoin Accepted"
Camera zooms back to man
Man: They take bitcoin here. I'll pay for the meal with my phone wallet and then get my dad to send us cash- pronto."
Woman: Ok honey- one question-
Man: What's that?
Woman: "What's a bitcoin?"
"With Bitcoin being accepted more and more places worldwide- and with the ability bitcoin brings us to send cash anywhere in the world- with incomparable transfer fees- well- it's time to get educated on bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-07 08:22:11
I think this is a great idea. I am going to give some bits out to some others around the world. I just set up a change tip account and thought it was easy ad could be...put 4.50 usd in it... send that OUT TO TWO PEOPLE IN TWO COUNTRIES!
@_date: 2014-09-10 19:36:52
Excellent video- one that shows the potential for Bitcoin. Very well done.

What's your problem Reichka, what exactly are you trying to accomplish by putting down this guy's attempt to communicate himself? Look forward to an answer.
@_date: 2015-01-25 02:38:23
I knew somebody who had this idea...have a beer for lil poboy kwala @_date: 2015-01-25 16:35:40

@_date: 2016-03-31 19:08:47
Cool-Friday the 8th at Pizza Guru at around noon. I think its perfect. Im gonna see how many people I can tell. 
@_date: 2016-03-30 23:40:26
First off-great to see a response. Let's meet however many we can-whenever we can-and continue to grow. 
We could say a quick meet-for example tomorrow at 11 am at Peets Coffee and Tea (3905 State Street) and another meet next week. 
Try to meet at both... or pick one. Anybody down tomorrow? Perhaps the weekend? I know bitcoiners are rarely spot in nature together so it'd be cool to do it! 
@_date: 2017-01-27 16:25:40
Me too! They will soon...! Message me if you want to know about next meetup.
@_date: 2017-01-27 21:34:03
Yeah, we all should definitely meet
Austin Vape and Smoke accept bitcoins at 4200 S 1st Street....they left comments above. It looks like we could get a good group going.
@_date: 2017-01-27 16:24:25
Come to next one, a cool group. Message me about next one.
@_date: 2017-01-27 16:24:51
Message me for next meetup time
@_date: 2017-01-27 16:26:05
Next one soon. Message me for time.

Next one soon! Message me for details! Good group.
@_date: 2016-11-26 14:46:35
Its unfortunate to see people get jerked around by economic policy-Bitcoin can and will give people another option to hold their money.
Options are great. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 15:15:07
Are you saying bitcoin cant take on a few more holders...? Are you saying dont spread the word on bitcoin...?
A stranger from the internet is EXACTLY who got me into bitcoin-while it was an "unfinished" technology as you say. I learned so much from the experience and it has been very rewarding.
So what exactly are you saying?
@_date: 2016-11-30 04:16:37
True story.
@_date: 2016-11-30 04:09:15
Everytime I read his articles I think-he is totally posturing-he doesn't get bitcoin but refuses to admit it and embrace something quite unique. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 00:59:05
The way of the future.
@_date: 2015-08-05 18:17:00
I've seen that guy- he's cool. I saw him the other day drinking a Kombucha and talking about different poses you can stand in to make your core stronger. He is real into groups- I think he had an orgy experience in Hawaii at some commune and has always tried to recreate the experience. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 18:13:43
I think it's great. The problem with bitcoin is you want to say- "Oh just sit back and let it do it's thing... it will grow..." 
But the truth is something different.
It takes people who care to get others to care about it. Every little bit of momentum helps. In particular, when so close to a tipping point.
@_date: 2015-07-05 22:14:09
I chatted with owner on Facebook. He seems like a nice person.
@_date: 2015-07-27 19:57:21
I thought that was a clever comment! Laughed out loud! Pretty cool that I can send you $3.50 that quick and easy for something that brought me joy.
@_date: 2015-07-13 02:44:03
Always a joy to read good information on this technology from a reputable/mainstream journal. Bitcoin should be considered seriously.
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:44:26
A coffee from Texas as promised I messaged you on Facebook originally
@_date: 2015-07-27 18:48:38
That's damn funny. Let's be friends. What country are you in? Have a beer on me @ @_date: 2015-07-05 22:00:58
Just went to the Facebook page and sent owner a message and we chatted back and forth. He understands bitcoin and seems like a nice guy. I'm going to send him $2.50 and ask that it go into somehow promoting BTC... who knows...

Could one move to Argentina with btc and prosper? Make a few grand...spread the Gospel of Satoshi!

I think many professors- DONT UNDERSTAND BITCOIN. Like me and many others-it takes a leap of faith to explore the idea. Many of my friends, who hear me talk about it constantly, still dont get it.
More papers, more press, more information on bitcoin must get out. 
Write the best damn paper-change some minds.
@_date: 2016-09-02 16:43:23
This is great! Upvoting...Oscar, where are you from and how are you?!

What's up with the negativity dude? Just checking, seems like-out of control....depressing even....!
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:38:35
I do-I was with bitcoin then- now DASH Digital Cash. The Dash treasury does cool stuff like this-and I think this is crucial if were ever going to expect to get the right people on board the Crypto Express. Plus I see Dash being the only coin that third worlders will be able to use considering where fees are at.
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:39:58
Would you ever consider making a film for Dash Digital Cash-we are like 5th place under bitcoin in regards to market cap. We need a good video and our treasury has 2 million dollars to pay out this month.
Thinking of like a short documentary.

My 1971 VW BUS just got painted and has the shining bitcoin symbol looking ever so glorious on it. It is going west and I will happily tell anyone who asks what a bitcoin is and why buying one is a great idea.
