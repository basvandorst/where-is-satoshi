And it is very unproven psychology.  We really need to stop taking social theories with weak supporting evidence so seriously.  There are so many factors involved that he may be right in the context of the past few hundred or even few thousand years, and may be wrong in the next 200.

You seem to have very similar ideas as I do on this subject.  I'm very excited to test some of these theories using computational models (agent-based specifically).  While you've described the structure well, and structure matters (networks, CA, have all taken off recently) more than most people could ever imagine, the individual behaviors matter a little more in humans than they do in trees.  I think the theoretical possibilities are incredibly exciting.
I do think that trying to reason out these types of things is a little disingenuous given what we know about complex systems.  Predicting large-scale human behavior is not something individuals are good at (by just reasoning through scenarios).  We really need to look more to science to solve these issues, as the simplifying assumptions we make in our mental models can be incredibly limiting or outright wrong.  The same problems apply to science, but computational platforms give us much more power to look at the interactions of many agents with many types of (sometimes conflicting, and at the very least highly heterogeneous) behaviors.

That's one very simplified view of history (to the point of being blatantly misleading).  
Yes, I've read Steven Pinker and a lot of other stuff on the decline of violence and rise of the nation-state.  None of it is close to being scientific at this point, but there are some very interesting hypotheses with some supporting evidence (like the post above).

That, every other ideology, and the post here are all speculative thought experiments.

I understand, but we're arguing over baseless speculation. What you or I believe is moot. What people do (as in what we can scientifically can show people actually do) is all that's important.  These are incredibly complex questions in incredibly high dimensional systems. 
Groups of people tend to do things the average human can't simply predict or fully understand.  Our mental models are very limited.

Are you assuming people are rational?  Why?
They most certainly are not, and people act "out of their right mind" on a daily basis.
