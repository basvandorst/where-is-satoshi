Yes unfortunately paying the fees. Wasn't sure if I could do something like that on GDAX.

Such a noob, LOL! You got me man. Glad to see I am co-invested with a degenerate like yourself. ��
Edit: everyone please look at his most recent thread. "Bitcoin noob here with some questions". The irony.

Good point. Will look into that.

I auto draft $30 a day worth of Bitcoin. Been planting seeds for a good while ��

It's okay, I won't get upset. A kid that asked if it was too late to get into bitcoin 23 hours ago called me a fucking idiot and a bitcoin noob. The fees scale with the total amount invested amigo. Not sure if you'd understand the concept though.

Tfw you realize you've taken all of your investment advice from 12 year olds... Time to head over to the stock market and invest in real... Profitable companies. The happiest day for me was selling all my coins and downloading Robinhood. 40%+ on the year.

The people telling you to not pay attention to dips are completely idiotic. It's a market. Timing is important. Buying without any consideration/research is very irresponsible.
