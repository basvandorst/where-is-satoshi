interesting, have to look at it

its not all open source, based on but includes private API

looking into a Trust scenario for that
@_date: 2015-06-19 05:42:35
not so sure if you structure it as a contract or trust there may be a way, but not as will, the legal requirements are just to tight and the format not flexible, it also depends on the jurisdiction

registered, went through the whole process only to receive an email that I can not link the Bitcoins to a currency in California, not sure if that means all USA as well. I think the German Bank handling is scared about US compliance (with good reason)

I hear from my friend about crack downs on the rich in Russia, that some are haunted by the Russian IRS and under house arrest. Its winter in Russia! However they did not promise democrazy or freedom within their system and Russians understand that very well. The gold option is something they consider I hear. Personally I think it would be a mistake but thats just me. I do however have no doubt that the sanctions will backfire. Putin will not change his decisions just for money, and even if you consider the amount of land and interest he gets from Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, thats money as well on the income side.
No my feeling is that the sanctions will push Russia to get leaner, more efficient and stronger, it will be costly but in the longterm such a development would create a shift of power.

the bigger players and established banks in the old boys network of London will find themselves circumvented and running after the fact, happened a few times, always been costly for them

so far the return is about 90% for the last 4 month of 2015

I try to avoid them even knowing, as long as they don't call compliance you are fine, so its not a longterm solution to do business with US banks

honestly not surprised, Wells Fargo will argue that Bitfinex has no standing for the suit its banking relation can use a different correspondent. However all the big US banks are creating trouble for Bitcoin originating transfers, its time the exchanges have their own clearing.

did you look at this:

there are a lot of legal questions and you are dealing with China, the cost argument is so that 0.25% will not get you a solution that works. The problem of the supplier who may default after getting paid is common and there is always a risk if there is no cover, which  could be an insurance or a performance bond.  However they increase the cost for the supplier and as such the price. There are cases where the buyer  gets the supplies for the supplier in his name and as such owns them so bankruptcy will not wipe  the value away, however bankruptcy is always a dicey game in China. 2M USD should be enough of a temptation to have a local bank handle the payment and you could use BPO's. In cryptocurrency that needs a local guy following up on all the different details and 0.25 % will not get you that. How about a local authorized buyer which handles things for you, since he  is local he can go there at the drop of a head, may be expensive but depends on details. Just an idea

doubt they can handle it, had accounts with them and international stuff was just above their understanding, talking about compliance they gave me more trouble than it was worth. Never mind Bitcoin, someone there is dreaming or did they get rid of the lawyers and risk people who only understand what they want to understand

not sure if I remember this right but there is

mine was as bad as it gets, never again

indeed but I found a lot of people didn't realize the IRS take on the matter
