You really shouldn't be using google drive to host a wallet. I know you want to keep it safe and backed up but really you are pretty much exposing yourself to any hacker by doing this.
I mean keep it offline or use an online wallet or something, I know people will say online wallets aren't as safe as a cold storage but they're a damn sight better than having them floating around on your google account
I guess if you insist on keeping them on drive use a clean account and use this account only for your wallet and nothing else, then you shouldn't have to worry about dodgy emails
There is another scam that was tried on me, it was an email from blockcha1n or something similar and wanted me to follow the link, I cant remember the exact details as it went straight to trash but I imagine it either wanted my google details or to do something to bitcoin qt.
Hopefully your coins are safe, I would definitely check and move them to a new wallet ASAP you can never be too careful. Also I would send them to the new wallet don't import the old wallet into the new one or the private key holding your BTC will be included and you'll still be at risk
Really when these come out this is all that should be trusted with your Bitcoin
But still a little while to go I think

Our company is always trying to keep up with the times, quickly introducing interesting and promising technological innovations. For payment of our services we accept all major types of electronic currencies. Starting today, we accept credit and most popular ~~kriptovalyuty~~ cryptocurrency - Bitcoin and ~~laytkoin~~ litecoin.
In recent months, interest in ~~kriptovalyutam~~ cryptocurrency of our current and potential customers has increased significantly. We are closely watching all their trends. Despite a mixed assessment of Bitcoins and ~~laytkoinov~~ litecoin professional financiers, as well as exchange rate fluctuations, we believe in their prospects. In a relatively short period of its existence the same Bitcoins have become part of popular culture: for example, in the popular series "Almost Human» (Almost Human) , they are positioned as the currency of the future. And this future is not far off: the most fantastic ideas at first glance in our time very quickly implemented.
We hope that soon ~~kriptovalyuty~~ cryptocurrency become more widespread and will cease to be perceived as something unusual and exotic. In addition, today they are already one of the safest (if not the safest) kind of electronic money.
Guided by the above considerations, we have added ~~laytkoiny~~ litecoin Bitcoins and the list of available means of payment. Selecting them from the list, you will be redirected to the payment system OKPay, which automatically recalculates GREATER payable in rubles at the current rate. Funds come to your balance within 30 - 60 minutes, no commission is charged.

I think you're probably right about the 3rd party, but even to apply for a credit card you need a lot of info, proof of address, valid id, first name last name etc
I think that it will be similar, you'd have a bitcard which acts as a debit card and allows you to use your bitcoin but the card would hold details such as your first name or even initial, it would be very traceable especially with online purchases 
However in terms of seeing how much anyone holds, you're right you would never, or it would be very difficult to see how much any one person has

On the Bitcoin forum there is a really great way to keep your BTC 100% safe
In essence you have a completely clean PC not connected to the internet (but with a wallet installed) you take the public key from the wallet and send all you BTC to it and then you take the wallet data file move it to memory stick and leave it in  a secure location, a bank vault your underwear draw anywhere you dont think anyone would look (probably best to make 2 copies just in case)
Then whenever you need to store BTC you send them to the public address and when you need to take money out you load up the wallet onto a computer and send them to where ever they need to go.
In theory this makes a 100% safe wallet, for extra security you could also encrypt it but make sure you have a copy of the password to decrypt it, this is a bit of effort but if security is what you're after then it's a best bet

Some wallets will give you more than 1 address by default, I'm not sure if there's any real benefit to it. But the idea is, if you have cash in lots of different places it's much harder to obtain if you're a hacker
Not entirely true if your computer gets hacked, though
Don't worry about the number of address you have, theres so many that can be created you wont be hurting the network by creating more

Your wallet can actually be a collection of Bitcoin addresses - so when the coin is sent to one of the addresses it will appear in your wallet..
Think of it like having £50 in £10 notes - in total you have £50 in your wallet but it's made up of smaller denominations.. obviously it's not quite like that as each address can have a varying number of coins in it but your wallet will take the total coin you have and display it as a sum

Living in the UK I find it is still really hard to purchase Bitcoins, I can purchase from Mt Gox but no way am I paying the £20+ bank fee just to buy a couple of BTC, I can use Blockchain but they cap at £100 every few days (a week I think) 
There is a UK exchange called Intersango but they are not open for new registration so its near impossible to buy or even sell Bitcoin
How do people from the UK purchase their Bitcoin do they have to suck it up and buy in bulk from Mt Gox or trust someone who is using paypal/google wallet to purchase?
I think that Bitcoin is great but it is really difficult to easily buy and sell them, I would love to be able to sell BTC from my store but I don't trust anyone not to do a charge back 10 days down the line just to scam me out of my money 
Does anyone know of a way to either sell BTC on a UK exchange without insane fees, or to sell them directly to customers without having to worry about them doing a charge back?

I would suggest having a sign up process at the very least, take customers home number their address get all the info you can on them, it wont stop anyone doing a charge back but I think that it will at least deter some of the assholes that would do it, I was hit pretty hard by emailing codes and not proving delivery, having to pay twice (once for the item once to pay back the chargeback) is not good. I would be extremely careful doing this. As people have said its the banks you have to convince and they will most likely side with the customer no matter what you tell them.
Sending them out by letter is also a good idea, have it fully tracked because then you can at least show the bank you have sent them something, even if the letter has nothing inside

Q. Tell me more about your Bitcoin transfer company BitInstant.
We’re one of the largest companies within Bitcoin and are probably one of the first start-ups in the space. We are the premier clearing house for Bitcoin - normal currency comes in, Bitcoin comes out and then Bitcoin comes in and normal currency comes out.
We have 700,000  locations in the US. You can go to any Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, and buy Bitcoins from these regions. We’re about to launch a British arm and already have about 50,000 locations in the UK from where you can buy a Bitcoin. You can walk into a location, buy a Bitcoin and witihin minutes send it to the US. Your family can then go to one of our locations and get that in dollars and get it in an hour.
Our locations in the US are public but locations in the UK are secret. That’s because we haven’t launched in the UK yet.
Not quite EU but it's start and will hopefully get the ball rolling for the rest of europe

Because they cost a lot of money to make and develop, there was also a good quote I read somewhere about how in the gold rush the people making and selling shovels and equipment to mine the gold made a lot of money..
Basically they are in it for the money, which they will and have make a lot of, there's plenty of time for them to invest in their own product by mining, and I'm sure they 'test' each one before shipping it
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:20:49
Bitcoin to mine isn't important the miners are also the processors so they are in charge of transactions, if a miner has 51% of the network they effectively own the entirety of Bitcoin and can do whatever they want with it... But I agree with Votacus, it is likely that at some point Bitcoin will be centralized, there is (and will be) a lot of money in Mining and so there will be a lot of big companies investing a lot of money - this means a very secure network, but an unsecure system if anyone manages to have 51%
@_date: 2013-07-17 19:41:19
More importantly never use Paypal unless you have complete tracking information
Bitcoin is safe to trade if you send out a tracked letter with a private key on, as soon as you've posted the letter you can also email the person the private key. You'll have proof of delivery so the chargeback will go to paypal or to the cc company

I suppose in theory the higher the total value of the mining equipment and the more miners the higher the value of Bitcoin as the miners will want to make a good roi.. 
I think he is right with the mtgox theory though, I think we can see mtgox becoming a ghost town over the next week or so. If you look at the volume of mtgox currently 36k you can actually see it rising (not that amazing but i've never seen serious rises in real time) you can also see the volume of each transaction is rising to a few thousand now, which i guess will be getting higher as time goes on.. and then suddenly lower when there is no usd left in people accounts

It may well be trolls but as they've shown before they're more than happy to dos the network and fuck everything up for small monetary gain.. I would say another attack is on the way..
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:32:36
Okay well lets say you've invented a new mining machine which can mine 1kg of gold a week, but you have no money and it's just an idea, but already there is a lot of interest in it and a lot of belief that you can make  it but it will take a while
So to fund the project you take a load of orders with a guarantee that it will be released, you get 10,000 orders and you start making them. You're now making £5000 an order, but if you ran the machine for a week you would make £2500
You have already taken the money and spent it to develop your product so you have to ship them, but you can keep a handful for yourself to generate extra income 
There would be no sense bfl keeping them all for themselves, it would ruin the network they would easily have majority share with just a few 100
The fact that they have majority share means that they can influence the network at will and are also generating 80% of the total bitcoin, now that 1 entity rules the network and has most of the bitcoin the entire idea is now useless, all demand has gone and all faith in the open network has gone, so bfl have spent all their money developing something that is now in essence, useless
It makes a lot more sense for them to sell them than keep them
@_date: 2013-03-07 21:54:47
I dont think it can ever be too late, if you're talking about it from a economic and profitable perspective then you have missed the days of buying a Bitcoin at $14 or less but we are yet to see how it will advance in the future and although there are many speculations about how it will go, so we can assume by the constant surge of popularity, that Bitcoin will continue to rise in price and become ever popular so I would say it is not too early to jump on the band wagon, in terms of currency and using the Bitcoin in day to day life, like it was intended, obviously there could never be a wrong time to join the hype as it will be used as day to day currency..
What sort of reading are you after, there is a lot to know about Bitcoin but I would say the two main 'categories' are Mining and general economics

These seem like a good idea but I dont see how they work, the price is set in USD rather than BTC, so how do you know how much Bitcoin you're buying, what is $50 worth of Bitcoin?
It must be set on the exchange when the card was made so you'd buy $50 worth of Bitcoin and find out it's worth $100, or you'd buy $50 and find out it's worth $25? 
It seems like theres a big flaw in this idea 
@_date: 2013-03-07 22:01:33
The only way would be to withdraw it to your bank account and put it on to paypal, or purchase some BTC with the money and sell it for paypal, but be careful with who you deal with because if they do a charge back on you, you won't be able to prove the item was sent and will lose your money
I would suggest withdrawing it back to your bank account

Don't fool yourself into thinking that it is stable where it is, look at the last crash and then at where we are now.

You have 4 choices;
Either - keep the Bitcoin qt installed and have to sync the blocks each time you use it (not recommended) 
Print out a paper wallet and send the funds there
Use an online wallet like Blockchain's or coinbase to store your coins
Or download a wallet
All of them are good options but it's up to you - if you want readily available coins which you can access from anywhere use an online wallet, if you want security I'd suggest a paper wallet. If you want to be in full control download a client that isn't the qt (other wallets dont have to sync to the network)
To send coin select Send coins and set the amount and the address you want to send the coin to on the qt client
Do not delete the qt until you've sent the coin elsewhere or you'll cause a hell of a lot of bother for yourself!
@_date: 2013-07-06 16:23:41

it's every 2016 blocks so for the first people to get the ASCIs (probably butterfly labs testing) they will rake in the coins so the first people to order will probably pay their investment off rather quickly

The main differences would be security, though as I can tell they're similarly strong and you dont have to download the blocks for the other wallets
The reason you dont have to download the blocks : your wallet provider has already synced to the network
I haven't used it personally - I tend to use Blockchain, but I understand it's a well known and trusted wallet it's also small and secure so I would say it is a safe bet
@_date: 2013-04-22 11:39:20
it is but I can see in the future there being very large wallets with thousands of bitcoin being stored inside and the owner of each will certainly be leaked 
Bitcoin address : xxxxxxx has bought xxxx from your store, the address for is xxxxx and the first name is xxxxx
It only takes a rich person to spend some money with one of their address for their name to be traced back
Even if the address they paid with was a lower value address if they took money from their 'storage' address and transferred it to their 'spending' address you can still make the connection
It might be anonymous but it is very open and traceable

The reason Bitcoin is so big and the others barely make a dent in terms of value or popularity has nothing to do with the way they are mined, it's simply because Bitcoin was the first and the one that receives all the press attention

I'm not too sure if there was an official press release, I noticed it this morning when I went to send some funds, but I think there was a reddit/bitcointalk post about it

I was joking thats just the first result for satoshi nakamoto anagram in google
I don't think anyone can say what his name means, for all we know it is actually his name.. regardless he had definitely built something great that will be remembered and hopefully used for years to come. And I guess when it becomes really big he'll let the world know who he is and become an over night celebrity... or something like that

The idea is simple - you try and knock the code off the 'stall' if it falls you get to keep it, if it doesn't fall you'll have to try again!
The idea comes from coconut shys at fairs - you can try it out free if you don't want to part with your BTC just yet - just go to Test Poke the Code

Ah okay so how is the processor assigned to each transaction, how is it decided who has processed each transaction, is it spread out evenly across the network and everyone processes them, or is the reward from processing each transaction given as a lump sum to whoever mines the block?

Bitcoin also rose like 1000% in a matter of months

I disagree, using a smartphone and tablet is how most people deal with physical transactions regarding Bitcoin.. the merchant has a tablet which they have a QR code with their public address loaded on, the customer then scans the code and sends the bitcoin over.
Because if anyone is going to be paying in Bitcoin, they're likely to be tech savvy anyway, it won't be that much more effort than handing over the cash, it might take a little longer but it will also drum up interest as it's a very abstract thing to purchase items using your phone

Nah you'll be fine with your current addresses, as I said theres no cap to the amount an address can hold so if you feel secure with 5 addresses, use 5.. Personally I only use one.
I think electrum allows you to add a new address or generate a new address I'm not sure how though

I think I might wait it out and see when BFL release the v2 of their products (it might take a few years but I think it will be worth the wait) when they have the miners working as they should be on the right energy consumption and they have finally managed to ship each order..
I think I'd only get an order if I could get it now, I think there's little point making a new order and waiting 6 months for it to arrive, if you find a seller and want a unit I would buy it from them not from bfl

they probably pool it up and send it out at the end of the month/week rather than sending it in little bits each time someone takes bit out

The console will be about £600 and come out near christmas so..
Probably slim I'd say £300 per Bitcoin as a maximum - unless there is a large marketing campaign to do with Bitcoin and big brands in the mean time

Well no one told me I was going to need Bits to use Bitcoin.

Actually you're not paying more you're paying the exact same.. Bitcoin is a currency not a commodity and so its value should be represented in Bitcoin not USD/GBP/EUR etc although you have to purchase BTC in other currencies the only thing that is changing is the value of Bitcoin to your currency, the fees will, and probably should, stay the same as it gives Bitcoin a ground level on which to be based

Expensive cute little gifts - they cost about the same as a gpu miner would ..

Blockchain, Bitfunder, Localbitcoins .....
@_date: 2013-05-08 11:19:22
Mosts pools split the profit, the example of a job was meant to represent each transaction rather than all the transactions so each time you process a transaction you get the fee associated with it, but in a pool it's added to a pot which is then split between each miner
@_date: 2013-05-07 14:58:54
The fee is just incentive for a miner to process your transaction, although theres a chance to make 25 bitcoin each block the miner will also get any fees associated with transactions they process.
So if you can imagine you have two jobs, they are exactly the same but one pays $5 and the other $50, which do you do first?

I think a rival to casscius would be a good idea as he is pretty much dominating the market, and he has said he welcomes competition, I think a physical bitcoin /w a private key would be desirable, not just a metal coin with the (a) bitcoin logo

The site is a store - is it safe to assume that it's a scam?
@_date: 2013-03-18 15:12:46
Bit Bargain looks pretty good actually shame about the .1 BTC signup fee (for verifying cc/dc details) but I guess that will help thin out the scammers. I'll have a look at transferwire as that looks promising too 
Thanks for the advice

No worries :)
Just a note for the Titan coins, the coins are (currently) tied to a email address rather than having a code on the back like the Casascius coins. I understand they are planning on changing this in the future, though.
