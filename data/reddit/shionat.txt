If the digital currency actively creates taxes for the government, then the government will be happy to accept it because the current distortion of the government's main job is to create taxes.

In any case, you need to pay taxes. If you don't pay, the government will force you to pay. Everyone knows this. Idiot.
Since tax is paid in any case, why not use a simple tax payment method, no one can intervene, there is no tax evasion
Stupid people can't imagine that this method of paying taxes can stop corruption.

Stupid, of course I know the existing digital currency, there is no such tax payment function. But it does not mean that it cannot be realized.
My purpose is to let digital currency developers see the content here. If they agree with what I said, they will implement it. It is not difficult to add tax-use wallets.
This is the mechanism in my own digital currency. I can't implement my plan for a short time. So open it and hope that others will implement it to promote the development of digital currency.

If you need independence, this is also suitable for you. You only need to gather a certain number of people, find a small island, and then build a country. But you need a government anyway. Maintain a government by paying taxes and let the government maintain order
This tax payment method, no one knows which country you paid the tax to, and how much.(Unless you disclose it yourself)
You can't abandon the government because of corruption. Anarchy will be even worse.
Corruption needs governance, not abandonment.
Even if you bring a few people to Mars, you need to form a government.

Any complicated calculation method can be simplified

Follow the tradition, you should advise everyone to use banknotes.
Innovation in digital currency can also drive innovation/changes in the tax system. Innovation means that it needs to change.
It seems that the stupid speculators here are not willing to push the government to accept the digital currency by taking the initiative to pay taxes.

I have already stated that this topic is only suitable for democratic countries.
Except force, No one can solve the problems of authoritarian countries. But they can be forced by the times
The authoritarian rulers clearly know that democratic rule is more advanced, and they are always learning the advanced things of the democratic state.
If they don’t learn, they will be forced to accept the development of the times.

It seems that you don't understand that the easiest way to pay taxes is to deduct it at the time of the transaction. The traditional way of paying taxes greatly consumes the energy of citizens and the government.
Of course not all transactions are subject to tax. There are also simple solutions to such transactions. Very easy to solve, not worth talking about
Existing tax payment methods:
If you run a company, You must find an accountant to "count the money (tax)" for the government .
If you pay taxes personally, you need to "count the money (tax)" for the government.
Adding such a tax payment method to the digital currency will prompt the government to accept it, and the government can't find a reasonable reason to suppress it. It seems that the idiot speculators here do not intend to pay taxes, let the government accept the digital currency.
If digital currency is easy to evade taxes, the result is only one: the government will never accept it, and will eventually define it as an illegal product.

If you don't want to pay taxes, Say it out loud, you don't want to pay taxes. No need to pull other
@_date: 2018-07-24 00:18:48
I understand that you want to be a locust.
You don't want to pay taxes, I think this is a corruption of citizens.
If you don't want to pay taxes / don't pay taxes, then you are not qualified to blame government corruption.
On the surface, the tax is paid by the merchant/payee. In fact, the tax is paid by the consumer. 
Although you really want to pay no taxes, But you can't do it.
If you think that income is too low, you should talk about how to get the government to raise the tax threshold.
But I believe that a democratic country has a very suitable tax threshold.
@_date: 2018-07-27 00:38:42
Sorry for letting you make a mistake.
In fact, this is a contradiction that idiots don’t understand.
Obviously you don't agree that a citizen does not pay taxes to a corrupt country. Turn taxes to the countries it supports. If you agree with this, there is no contradiction. If you disagree, your idea is very suitable for living in a dictatorship.
The word country here, I think fools know that it refers to the government. Unless you think you are pay taxes to the land.
You have to understand the prerequisites of the obligation.
@_date: 2018-07-23 00:30:00
You can bravely not pay taxes, why not dare to pay taxes to the countries you support. idiot
If you are in a dictatorship, then this is really not suitable for you to discuss. The dictatorship will never accept digital currency
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:36:51
The idiot, the responsibility of paying taxes is of course to maintain the normal operation of the government.
Do you tell me that the duty to pay taxes has other meanings?
@_date: 2018-07-22 15:56:54
Wrong, the government was originally formed by citizens. If citizens do not pay taxes to the government, how can the government maintain its work.
My second point has already explained your concerns. 


Think about it yourself, I can't say too much, many people are watching me.

Smart contracts are suitable for commercial use. It is a joke to use it for taxation, which will increase tax avoidance (people's corruption), the government can't manage tax evaders. Please think carefully with the brain
@_date: 2018-07-23 01:11:58
You forgot that Bitcoin is a world of consensus, and everything can be achieved under consensus. Smart contracts are also a method, which is definitely not the best way.
There is no need to rewrite the tax law/law, only need to reach a consensus, use time to eliminate the traditional system.
If the digital money users all over the world agree to such a tax payment method, they do not need to go through the government's consent. Because the willingness to implement citizens is the responsibility of the government.
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:30:58
Don't mess up this topic
If you think your government is not worth paying taxes, you can pay taxes to other countries and become citizens of other countries.
For example, in the era of digital currency, no one pays taxes to a corrupt country, then the government of this country means being abandoned... the result you can imagine
Now you should understand this intention.


Don't show your stupidity in front of me

If the implementation really develops to an irrelevant day,
Then there are only two possibilities: 1 the corrupt government has disappeared, 2 the government no longer relies on tax maintenance. In this case, these taxes can simply become a certain kind of provident fund.
But if no one does this, corruption and taxes will always exist and will become more serious.
@_date: 2018-07-22 15:35:27
My second point is expressed, your concern. If you think your country is corrupt, you can pay taxes and fees to other countries and become citizens of other countries.
@_date: 2018-07-22 15:27:16
It is the responsibility of citizens to pay taxes to their own country.
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:59:21
Damn social insurance, pensions are born out of corruption. +Medical insurance. +various provident fund.
These compulsory purchases of insurance are just another type of tax.
In fact, the tax paid by a person’s life-long consumption is enough for the government to provide old-age security for citizens.
Of course, if many people evade taxes, they cannot provide these guarantees.
