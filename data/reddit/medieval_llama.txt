Incorrect. I synced the blockchain just recently from scratch in 9 hours on mid-tier, several years old consumer hardware.

One thing I've assumed would happen is the mining gear evolution would taper off. At that point, the mining tech can be integrated in different types of heaters and devices that need to dump energy (like a house with solar panels, and with battery packs already charged up) or have access to cheap energy. 
Each individual appliance would contribute very little, and would not earn anything (best case, the produced heat would be free), but there would be lots and lots of them.

What metric would you prefer for measuring most popular node software?

S7 is alright, but... more Lamborghinis and Teslas please

Cool, can we raise the transaction capacity now? Bitcoin needs to grow in order to survive (as in, be relevant, not just be around).
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:44:14
Correct. But, to be fair, it was core devs who shat the pants.
@_date: 2017-03-01 21:18:06
Some of the more prominent core developers have pretty questionable motivation because of their employer's investors.

We all know that Lightning is the future, so let's build it and start development of services and applications that use it. When Lightning becomes more concrete, demand for segwit will come automatically.
@_date: 2016-03-13 22:19:51


Maybe. We'll know better when that technology is specified in detail, and experiments run.

I'm sorry. I wanted to use your line verbatim, but indeed I've quoted you out of context. I'll update my comment.

Sounds like challenging (in a good, exciting way) engineering problems to solve. Also sounds like the "release this summer" target is a few years off.

How much would you estimate until general availability? 1 month, 6 months, 1 year?

Bitcoin Cash is a temporary name. Long term plan (well, hope) is to be just Bitcoin.

"around the corner" makes it sound like it is almost here. Is that not speculation?
From Rusty's dev post the other day it sounded like a cool research prototype, not a system in its final implementation stages.
@_date: 2017-08-20 07:58:36
Yeah. NYA was in relation to Bitcoin, and Jihan is saying Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin. Looking good ;-)

Adding segwit increases complexity. You cannot remove segwit down the road--this is a complexity that will stay with bitcoin forever. The more complex bitcoin codebase gets, the harder and slower its development becomes, on-chain scaling included.

What do you think would be an acceptable monthly cost of running a node?
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:40:30
Let's say you allocate half of your budget to buying storage. A 3TB drive on NewEgg is $89. So the monthly $25 buys you about 842GB. That's 117MB every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2016-10-11 06:28:31
With working on-chain transactions there's less incentive to use off-chain solutions. That's bad when you're building an off-chain solution.
@_date: 2016-10-11 12:50:10
Sure, absolutely, there are use cases where payment channels are the correct solution, e.g. pay-per-minute billing.
@_date: 2017-07-03 03:54:04
The so called core experts allowed bitcoin to run into a fee wall. If they decide to go do something else, that would be great.
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:57:07
Technically there is controversy about
* it being a softfork instead of hardfork -- complicates the implementation
* it having an arbitrary discount for the new transaction type
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:54:40
Segwit is controversial, or else majority of hashing power would be signalling it. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 09:39:31
Love your optimism!
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:12:07
How would one measure support for segwit? Count the number of pro-segwit threads in this sub?
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:52:54
Let's say I write a BIP to increase the 21M coin limit. My BIP would specify how nodes can signal support for it. Then, over the next few months 60'000 new nodes would come online signalling support for it. Would you then say my BIP has achieved consensus?
@_date: 2017-06-10 16:48:01
Wanna buy a cup of coffee using Bitcoin? Easy! Step one: open a LN channel for $330.   
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:18:50
Yeah, exchange-&gt;me over LN would work. 


OK, assume there's tons of demand. Fees are skyrocketing, everyone is upset, market is ripe for a 2nd layer solution. How much until the point where I can use LN to transact with my exchange and with retailers do you think? 1 month, 6 months, 1 year?
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:33:40
Fair enough. But then you can only claim "X is / is not controversial" after the flag date, not before.
@_date: 2017-06-10 17:00:03
You got it backwards. Buying/selling on exchange is still cheap. Making a bitcoin transaction ("using it") is getting expensive
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:09:39

@_date: 2017-06-14 23:54:29
From coin.dance/poli. It says "76 in support, 53 ready, and 10 in opposition."
"ready" is not the same as "support". For example, I have insured my car so I am "ready" to crash my car. Doesn't mean I *want* to.
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:47:10
75 out of 138. That's not exactly "everyone"
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:49:10
I take it as a "yes" then. i.e., the number of signalling nodes is a valid measure of support. 
Here's a relevant [older comment of yours](




In this case, the ratio between segwit nodes and segwit blocks is about three to one--one could argue this is nothing more than a bunch of salty core supporters trying to win an internet argument ;-)
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:07:43
coin.dance/poli says 75 out of 138 support segwit. 
5% saying "support" would not be controversial.
95% saying "support" would not be controversial.
54% saying "support" is *exactly* controversial.
@_date: 2017-06-10 17:03:34
Not with that attitude ;-)
@_date: 2017-06-10 17:25:47
My LN channel balance is $20. I want to make a $30 payment. Can I "fund" the channel without another on-chain transaction?
If SW activated tomorrow, when do you think we will have LN in production? In 1 month, 6 months, 1 year? Luke said "around the corner" [a year ago](
@_date: 2017-06-10 16:54:07
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:47:43
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:56:13
Short to medium term: straightforward on-chain scaling. Obviously there are bandwidth concerns if every full node must process every transaction, but they are not as bad as they are made out to be. Politically how to make that happen I don't know.
I think that bitcoin does have a chance to remain a relevant player. Otherwise I would have sold my coins, and would not have bothered to post here.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:51:37
Soon we will have real good decentralization.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:02:49
Is that a "No"? Almost 90% of nodes would be signalling it!
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:48:31


FWIW as a software developer I think this is very, very optimistic. One year is optimistic. Last I heard LN was in research stage, with the transaction routing problem unresolved. But I'm just guessing too.
Anyway, let's be optimistic and say SegWit activates in 2 months, LN is ready to go 3 more months later, and major players have adopted it 1 month after that. Looking at current market dominance trends, seems to me Bitcoin may not be all that relevant by then.
