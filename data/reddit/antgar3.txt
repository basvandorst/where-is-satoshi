Vechain seems optimistic 
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:19:12
The market is volatile always, BTC will always be here, so yes there is profit to be made.

@_date: 2018-01-08 01:35:36
Wake up BUY these dips!
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:26:11
No these NOOBS just follow every movement of these traders. If traders sell, they start selling and loose money. That’s all. They’re learning there lessons. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:34:26
You sad
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:34:25
It’s the beginning of January! BTC will keep rising and falling. It fluctuates. Welcome to the market.
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:05:46
And that is the story of how you got the name "Crypto Creep"
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:08:02
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:51:14
whales will kill you, don't do it
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:02:09
Yes BTC will be here for a long time, and that is good that noobs are leaving. But I just want these new "investors" to not have high expectations. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 04:11:03
Of course, just look at GDAX, these group of whales are using the most insane pump n dumps, they are ruining crypto 
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:58:12
Awesome more people will buy BTC, ETH all that good stuff! More registrations = More $$$ Hodl strong!
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:04:49
It’s pronounced YODL!
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:06:21
Nah bro its owned by all these banks.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:24:36
It’s just to risky now. Those who say hodl are the ones who want people to buy so that they can up the price imo
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:25:46
If anything buy in when it hits a dollar
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:20:41
At what price did you buy?
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:39:10
is it me or does the guy in the orange shirt look like the white version of Craig Grant 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:40:28
Luckily I am a lambo
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:35:59
nobody knows, I don't even know what it will be in 1 minute
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:16:01
same waiting to see if it's a new coin listing

Could be possible that these whales are pumping it while the fishes buy and then whales start bringing the price down. They probably control over 70% of all bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:27:10
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:36:10
I have to agree, it really was a pump n dump
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:27:52
Elon Musk is not Satoshi! He is a MARTIAN trying to find his way back home.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:16:22
holding is pointless at times, if your coin went from $100 litecoin to $355 litecoin in just a week why would you hold? same with bitcoin $9,000 to $20,000 These are basically pump and dumps in a way. Now look at the prices $120 lite coin and $8400 bitcoin. My point is, buy low sell high, holding doesn't always work.
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:25:43
The stock guy looks so stressed out over a 6% drop, i can’t imagine what he would be doing with a 70% drop in bitcoin lol
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:29:27
Bull trap.
