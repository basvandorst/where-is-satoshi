people will start to use lightning custodial services, like bluewallet. there will be 0 fees besides what the company wants to charge you. this makes it not your keys not your bitcoin though.

blue wallet is not your keys, not your bitcoin.

none of those complaints matter except having to be always online. that's a huge problem for proper lightning adoption. are we really going to be just using lightning banks in the future? i hope that's not the goal

very interesting how confused stephen is. this video is recent? hasn't he been involved with crypto for years? why does it sound like he's never heard of bitcoin before?

frontend/backend is just standard boring web app stuff.  
the only interesting part is the QR codes &amp; reacting to payments... which i'm currently cheating with by using opennode. they have a simple api for generating/handling the payment addresses and sending me a webhook when it's paid. in theory i should be able to just replace them with my own bitcoin/lightning node. but i'm having trouble getting that running on my computer. issues with port forwarding i think

looks like someone managed to leave a 0 BTC donation o.O

it's standard. you can reconstruct their keys using any implementation, including my site

should've seen that coming. fixed it

too much effort (it's not decoupled from the rest of the web server), the code isn't interesting enough.  
if you want to do something similar, use opennode, which is what i'm currently doing. maybe when i get my own node working it's worth uploading the source code!

thanks for paying  your stupid tax! bitcoin holders directly benefit from the deflation when this happens :D

 !lntip is very cool, but why doesn't it work for me?
