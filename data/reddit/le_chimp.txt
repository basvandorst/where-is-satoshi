you do need to adjust your fairness. look at the payout rate
In this case P1 and P2 can't pick the same cup I'm assuming. 
So in this case there is a 1/3 chance of double 
a 1/3 chance of nonthing and 
a 1/3 chance of 2/3rds payout.
This gives a payout rate of 66.67% for P1 &amp; P2(for every BTC gambles you will win .667 back). this is very low, most casino games are around 85-99%.
P3 is practicably the house in this case and will always win in the end.
if you want to make it more fair you need P3 to risk something.
this is how you could change it. 
P1 and P2 are unrestricted in which cup they chose.
If P1 and P2 Pick the same cup then P3 will match their bets, if an empty cup then the money on the table is split 3 ways. if P1 and P2 pick different cups the game is played as you described it.
Assuming no conclusion between P1 and P2 the pay out rate becomes 100%. in other words P1 P2 and P3 on average will win as much money as they lose.

so $9998 should be fine?

Too hard with their business model.
atm they take pledges and at the end of the project they either charge everyone's CC the amount if they reached the goal or they failed the goal and they don't charge anyone.
now with BTC there is a big problem. 1stly they cant have a delayed transaction. meaning either people have to pay up front and they need to give refunds for failed projects or they have to rely on people paying after, which some would forget or decide not to now they are left short.
If they do decide to have BTC up front they have another problem what value do they assign the coins? the current BTC rate if they exchange the BTC to USD right away they have a massive risk if at the end of the project they have failed to met the goal they need to rebuy the BTC to refund it which could of shifted dramatically leading to a large loss.
If they handle the BTC separately and hold them till the end of the project the donated so far counter becomes erratic a BTC pledge could have 100s of dollars worth of movement every day making the goal jump around. or how about if i pledge enough BTC for a reward tier but at the end of the kick starter the BTC price shifts and i no longer qualify for that tier?
Just too many problems kickstarter would have introducing multiple currencies for it to work.

Depends on the assumptions you make. What we have here is a perpetuity, it's value is calculated on the current value of all future payments.
The problem here is the unknown nature of the Hash difficulty rate. if we assume no changes it's very easy to calculate
assuming a 5% ROI and no difficulty increase 1 share is worth 0.302074 BTC.
assuming a 40% ROI and no difficulty increase 1 share is worth 0.0377592 BTC.
assuming a 40% ROI and difficulty doubles every year 1 share is worth ~0.008391 BTC.
then add in risk factor, i'd say it's probably about right perhaps even a bit optimistic

Wrong they do care. not because they care that you eat it but if they let staff eat old food they become liable if they get sick, they also get into trouble for health violations.
Thats why they throw it out and not donate it and thats why they come down hard on anyone who eats it.

 answers your question on tracking a BTC
" someone is scammed and posts the address they were using on the Bitcoin forum. It is possible to see which address they sent coins to. When coins are sent from this (the scammer's) address, the addresses that receive them can also be easily found and posted on the forum. In this way, all of these coins are marked as "dirty", potentially over an infinite number of future transactions. When some smart and honest person notices that his address is now listed, he can reveal who he received those coins from. The Bitcoin community can now break some legs, asking, "Who did you receive these coins from? What did you create this address for?" Eventually the original scammer will be found. Clearly, this becomes more difficult the more addresses that exist between the "target" and the "identity point"."
so in your example the government could trace the coins and where they have ended up but unless a recipient volunteers information that they received the coins the government will never know anything beyond the address of the wallet.
Laundering these coins would be fairly easy as well. use a few proxies and deposit and withdraw from some sites like the gambling ones around and it will soon become so difficult to trace the flow of coins it's be near impossible to trace them back to their source

Let me try and explain.
3 Cups A B C the bet is 1 BTC
P1 and P2 pick Cup A.
P3 then cup B.
Empty cup so every one splits the pot. the Pot is 2 BTC(1 from P1 and P2) so that .66 BTC to P1 and P2. P3 gets .68.
Next scenario:
P1 and P2 pick Cup c.
P3 then cup C.
In this case P3 loses P2 not has to match Both P1 and P2 best so P3 pays out 2 BTC and P1 and P2 wins 2 BTC each(the Pool is 1 BTC from P1,1 BTC from P2 and 2 BTC from P3) in this case P3 loses 2x the bet.
This give a perfectly balanced game. over a long period of time you will win .98 for every 1 BTC you put in. P3 as the house will win 1.04 BTC for every BTC gambled. 
I put a house advantage in the rounding, normally 2 BTC split 3 ways is .66666666~ each. by rounding the Players down to .66 you get a 4% advantage to the house.
As for guarding against collusion. you would need a pool of player for this to work. have people place bets in a betting period, say 5 minutes once these 5 mins are up close the betting and match up each player with a random other player for the game. then the houses chooses a random cup and all games are played against with that cup as the chosen cup. So 20 people make a bet it will make 10 random pairs you will then chose a cup Say cup C and every game cup C is chosen.

comparing the rates:
Mt Gox current current USD high and AUD Low,
VISA's rates assuming a 1% Bank fee,
An exchange at a Bank from USD to AUD (No fees taken into account),
Currencyfair.com taking the flat Fee out.
100 USD is:
Bitcoin - 94.85 AUD
VISA - 91.77 AUD
Bank - 93.85 AUD
Currencyfair - 96.41 AUD
Looks like Bitcoin has the best exchange rates at low values(less than ~300) but for larger amounts Currencyfair looks better.
