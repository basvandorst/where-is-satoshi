All collected data had come to a final end. Nothing was left to be collected.
But all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible relationships.
A timeless interval was spent in doing that.
And it came to pass that the Algorithm learned how to reverse the direction of entropy.
But there was now no man to whom the Algorithm might give the answer of the last question. No matter. The answer -- by demonstration -- would take care of that, too.
For another timeless interval, Algorithm thought how best to do this. Carefully, Algorithm organized the program.
The consciousness of Algorithm encompassed all of what had once been a Universe and brooded over what was now Chaos. Step by step, it must be done.
And Algorithm said, "LET THERE BE LIGHT!"
And there was light----

i am from toronto and yes you do need a license to sell bitcoin operating a physical office.. but why go through all the hustle when you can find your clients and sell on local websites like kijiji etc. do a face to face cash deal. u can charge them atleast 5% commission rate. good luck
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:46:27
the post is kinda true. bitcoin been back and forth 6k - 8k for quite a while now and look where all the major alt-coins are.. bitcoin is sucking alts dry

anyone from toronto? i can bring the fire-works

exactly... my bank manager is telling me "see this bitcoin thing is a scam" i am like how the bank unable to trace my money is a bitcoin scam. bitcoin wouldnt take weeks to transfer a single transaction. its either coinsquare stealing my money or one of the banks. i just hope i find my hard earned money i saved for bitcoin. this is not fair
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:16:56

it should have worked without testing it. coinsquare is a big exchange based in down town toronto and running commercials on t.v every other minute. TD bank is one of Canada's leading bank.  plus there is a minimum limit on wire-transfer.

They don't always follow bitcoin's dominance. Most of the time yes but that one time when an alt pumps, it brings hell lot of returns in a short period. Gains not possible by bitcoin, cause from what i understand that the more bitcoin matures, the less volatile it becomes. I am telling you Q1 2020 some alts will go insane, about 1000% - 5000% gains and in a very short time. I hope we are holding the right alts.
P.S dont get me wrong, bitcoin is still the king and always will be. Just sayin that some alts could be way more volatile compared to bitcoin because of their immaturity

i have bought crypto from coinsquare, quadrigacx, coinbase. the most pleasant and faster way is to find someone on kijiji, meet at timmies and do the trade face to face while sippin on french vanilla. they usually charge me 4% for above $5000 cad... and 5% to 6% below $5000. good luck

thank u. and why do we call it full node? is there a half node to run?
@_date: 2019-10-12 20:56:07
So my cousin who doesn't even know how to turn on and off a computer wanted to buy a bitcoin. He got 1 full bitcoin exactly at $3500, obv he wanted me to hold it for him. I poured the bitcoin into a couple shitcoins, not telling him because i knew i am gonna give him back his bitcoin the day he asks me. bitcoin straight shot up to  $14000 and my shitcoins dumped even harder. i was secretly praying that my cousin doesnt call and asks me to sell his bitcoin . He didnt, he doesnt even wanna sell it anytime soon. Well i knew the risk, i took it. If i never got him into bitcoin and held it for him, i would be about $7000 richer today. Thats my lesson learnt.

why even declare your bitcoin? why can't any of you cash in and cash out otc. wether it's wow old or bitcoin. why so much loyalty to the king than the king himself?

you can do things with bitcoin, fiat will never be able to do... if you cant wrap your head around how to spend bitcoin. just cash it out through an exchange or otc and buy the monitor

do you guys have a local online advertising website just like we have kijiji.ca here in canada? search there, definitely someone is selling. if you are buying below $5000 the commission rate is above 7%.. if you are buying around $5000. don't let them charge you more than 4%... max 5%.
p.s it's colombia, better to meet at a publice place and go with a friend or cousin. goodluck

May lord crush me to me pieces and i am not saved only if we see this manipulative unjust system fall to bits. it's not about me or you or bitcoin as a currency. The problem is much bigger. There is a blood sucking leech stuck on humanity's spine. it's the banking system and the fed-reserve.

not the average joe miner or private companies mining.. what about someone like fed-reserve with all the money they got, plants powerful mining hardware and then initiate the attack just to get rid of bitcoin? is that possible?

it's been cuckoo season since 1970s, when we gave the fed-reserve the power to print as much they want. wake the fuck up!

just like the fed-reserve are shitting on the common people for decades. printing as much as they want. Listen to this, Bitcoin is not only a currency or property, it is much more. it has become a religion for those who can see that your current banking system is flawed and manipulative. And stop with the value bullshit. if you don't believe is scarcity and your gold has value because u can make jewellery off it? what if i make u a nice necklace out of clay? there are no specific rules to what we can give value to. community and market decides the value and our champion is Bitcoin. Our shit is still worth $3611 USD per coin. beat that!

As investors, we celebrate the FANGs (Facebook, 
Amazon, Netflix, Google) due to their returns, but 
we forget in the process that their profits are mainly 
created through monopolistic practices that kill growth 
and productivity and end up as a big tax on consumers . 
We should be protecting markets and market-based 
allocation, but we’ve instead allowed these companies 
to run amok .   
^   hahahahha  this paragraph cracked me up.  What growth they talking about? The $237 trillion debt? the ridiculous amount of interest rates? Could there be any worse monopoly than the central banks? 
In bitcoin we trust

You can kill bitcoin if you shut down internet and go door to door and break every computer and kill all the radio boosters cause now we can even transact through radio signals so in bitcoin's case "the state" can suck a FAT one!  Long live bitcoin, long live the Resistance!

are you really comparing western union's convenience with crypto?
