So I think that there are two sides to the scarcity point, and it kind of sounds like people conflate the two, which is why they don't seem to understand eachother. Bitcoins ARE scarce in an absolute sense because the total amount of coins is capped. But I've also heard the argument that the scarcity of bitcoin will reduce it's transactional value because the hoarding will take too much of it out of circulation.  I think it's a reasonable response to say that the divisibilty of bitcoin will preserve it's transactional utility once we're at the point where the money supply no longer grows.
The latter argument is a form of "Bitcoin aren't scarce because they're subdividable", but it's only referring to scarcity of trade able units. 
In this video, the cracker doesn't represent any value beyond the cracker itself.  If the value of goods for which the cracker could be exchanged doubled as the lady broke it in half, the girl really would be twice as well off.

But breaking the cookie in half increases the utility of the cookie as a means of exchange, because she can now use that cookie for two transactions instead of one.  If she didn't break the cookie, the girl wouldn't have been able to exchange her half cookie for something that in the previous time period would have cost 1 whole cookie.  If cookies are the basis for exchange, then it would become problematic if cookies became too valuable because people wouldn't be able to exchange fractions of cookies for lower value goods. Being able to divide the cookie solves that specific problem. 
My only point in my comment was that this is also a form of scarcity, a finite amount of exhangeable units.  Bitcoin doesn't have this problem because it can be subdivided to create more units of exchange, even if each unit represents a fraction of the total value of the larger unit,to create more things to exchange.  This is a separate issue from the scarcity of the total quantity of bitcoin, which is a real issue and one that divisibilty in no way addresses.

His assumptions are that: 
1.) the guy who created bitcoin is otherwise employed
2.) the media would run with the story and act like it was the end of bitcoin once coins started leaving that address. 
I don't think either of those are remotely unreasonable.

Unfortunately, and I'm broadly generalizing, but I think those are STEM stereotypes, and it seems like most early adopters in Bitcoin are STEMs or economists.  
That divide needs to be bridged. I know python, but I shouldn't have to in order to extract a bitcoin QT wallet and move it to another wallet client. 
Personally, I don't hate central banking and I think that the relationship between the state and individuals is far more complex than libertarians make it out to be, I just like Bitcoin because it's more efficient and it challenges existing institutions that are clearly broken. I like sender initiated transactions and I like the low fees, I like not supporting huge credit banks, I think that a deflationary currency could be good from a resource conservation perspective. This puts me in the minority of Bitcoin users, and an even more minuscule minority f r/bitcoin.

I'm not saying Apple is a bad company, I think that a petition just signals to them that this decision may not be in the companies best interest. It may also generate bad press for them.
As people have said elsewhere, there decision isn't entirely unreasonable, a company like that has no need to take on unnecessary risk.  
When you said "you sort of have to make them do it", I thought you meant through our purchasing habits, possibly because most people in this sub are blind believers in corrective market forces.  That doesn't appear to be what you meant, since you said you don't think boycotts work, and that would essentially be a boycott. 
This really isn't that big of a blow for Bitcoin's long run outlook, if a lot of people use HTML clients on their iPhones then they'll reconsider.    So I don't think that illegal subversion is necessary (nor do I think it's a good tactic in general).

Someone close to me is a journalist, and from helping her out on some work with investigative journalism, I've learned that a lot of times journalists have a lot more information that they're not able to put into print, off-record sources, sources that aren't reliable enough to publish but still inform your opinion, sources that make a claim and backtrack out of fear.
On the outside it looks like a journalist jumped to conclusions in order to break an unverified story, but it's easily possible that she had more information that wasn't good enough to go to print with,  but was enough to personally convince her, so she printed what she could to support what she thought. 
Obviously what she did was irresponsible, I'm only speaking to the disconnect between what the public knows, what the journalist can print, and what the journalist knows.

But a huge piece of the evidence in the Newsweek article was that he supposedly said he wasn't working on Bitcoin "anymore".  Without that, all we have is a guy with a relatively common Japanese name who protects his secrecy, distrusts banks, who was ill for a few years, and who's brother thinks he's really smart.  Literally millions of people fit that description.  
Now that the real satoshi (once it's signed or verified in some other way) has claimed that he's not Satoshi.  Now, At Best all newsweek really has as evidence is Dorian's out-of-context statement that sort of hints at him being satoshi, that happens to contradict the words of the actual Satoshi.  
You're right that if he were Satoshi, it would make sense for him to deny it, but there is no convincing evidence to think Dorian is Satoshi beyond the opinion of a zealous reporter.  So I think this does go some way toward dispelling the theory, the burden of proof is not on Dorian/Satoshi to prove they are not one in the same, the association between Dorian and the Satoshi identity were the product of speculation and overattention to coincidences to begin with.

If you don't understand public key crypto, you should be no where near bitcoin.

You don't have to be know all the details of public key encryption, all I'm saying is you should know that it exists.

One of the biggest draws of Bitcoin is that it's a very cheap way to send money to someone anywhere else in the world as long as they have an internet connection.  Western Union charges around 10 cents on the dollar per transaction, Bitcoin is virtually free to move around once you have it.  
As internet deployment increases globally, this could be a serious threat to western union.  WU make a fair amount of money off immigrants to western countries back home to their country origin.  If these individuals could send Bitcoin home for free instead, a western company could easily set up outposts in developing countries where individuals could receive Bitcoin from their friends/relatives, and immediately redeem them for local currency at a 5-9% fee, still cheaper than WU.

That's the point of Bitcoin and if you don't understand that you shouldn't be investing In bitcoin.
'Cashing out' at an opportune time is risky, involves timing the market. I don't possess the knowledge to do that, so I'm going to hold until I need the money for something

Alright man, it takes about 5 minutes on wikipedia to learn what public key crypto is and gain a very high-level idea of how it works.  In my opinion having that level of knowledge is important for people pouring their hard-earned money into something that's technologically complicated.  But I suppose you're right that to send and receive Bitcoin all you need to know is "share receiving address" and "don't share wallet."  
Personally, I had an issue where I encrypted a wallet and couldn't remember the password. I ended up recovering the funds by contacting someone who runs a password recovery service.  In order for him to decrypt the wallet, I extracted part of my encrypted wallet, and two of the associated receiving addresses.  He was able to decrypt my wallet, but because he didn't have the receiving address that actually contained funds, he wasn't able to steal all my money. I sent a fee to one of the receiving addresses i gave him, and he was able to get it using my password, confirming that he had in fact found my password.  
I know this is a very rare occurrence, but at least for me having a very basic knowledge of what public key crypto is was very helpful.

Most of the evidence is at best circumstantial.  They have chat records that if believed, would also implicate him in the murder of a person who doesn't exist.

Oh and he was recruiting people for a startup around the time Silk Road came about.

I wouldn't use coinbase as it's tied to Mt. Gox, and therefore vulnerable to ddos etc.  
The advantage with using bitpay or others is that you are insulated from the daily fluctuation in prices. If you were say, a burger restaurant with very thin margins, you couldn't afford to sell a burger for a price that ends up being less than the amount you paid on margin to make that burger.  
If a significant amount of your income comes from renting your holiday home, and say you need the income from renting your home for maintenance etc., BitPay or one of their competitors is probably your best option.  
If however, you only rent out your holiday home to make a little extra money, and don't immediately need to spend that money, it might make sense to accept Bitcoin directly.  You can always cash out small amounts of Bitcoin once you receive them, to ensure that you get some revenue in national fiat, and then you may treat the rest of your Bitcoin as a long-term investment. 
If you are going to accept Bitcoins directly though, you need to be prepared for crazy daily fluctuations. It is very possible that you'll rent out your place for Bitcoin when the price is $200 a coin, and then within two days it will be $100.  What you need to keep in mind is that if you view the Bitcoin your retain as a long term investment, these daily fluctuations aren't too meaningful, and you shouldn't let them deter you.

To clarify your post since burnsomethingup didn't seem to understand, I believe what you mean is that people holding some Bitcoin and some USD on Mt Gox should convert it all to Bitcoin, so that it can be easily sent to another exchange, in order to avoid suffering from the DDOS
If instead you were to keep all of your money on Mt Gox in USD, once the trade outage occurs, you won't be able to buy bitcoin, nor will you be able to withdraw dollars quickly enough to do anything with them.  Is this the gist of what you had in mind? 
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:28:32
I understand that my cell phone connects to a cell tower and relays signals of some sort to other cell phones, so I know that the voice I am hearing belongs to someone on the other end.  I know based on the phone numbering system and the fact that large companies vouch for it that when I dial a number I can reasonable expect the person on the other end to be the one I want to talk to, and if its not, there is a very limited set of situations that lead to someone else being on the other end.  
I think this level of understanding, a very basic one, is important even for Bitcoin.  Public key encryption is part of the brilliance of Bitcoin, it's one of the crucial things that makes it viable.  Unlike my cell phone, there is no Bitcoin company that is on the hook if Bitcoin doesn't behave the way I expect it to.  My issue is that too many people, particularly on this sub seem to view Bitcoin as a money box, you put fiat in and watch your money grow.  
It takes 5 minutes on wikipedia to gain the type of understanding of private key crypto that I'm talking about.  If you think your cellphone is a magic device that always puts you in touch with whoever you want, just because it worked like that a few times, you could get yourself into trouble.  Basically I just think people should understand Bitcoin about as well as they understand their cell phone, and knowing what public key crypto is is part of that.

Consistent with the vision of libertarianism, perhaps, but there's more to it than that. 
I think it goes beyond libertarianism.  Libertarians are afraid of powerful governments.  Left-wingers are afraid of powerful corporations / non-governmental institutions, which seem to inevitably form to fill the power void when governments are weak.  
Bitcoin is designed to be decentralized, it distributes monetary influence by nature, and it relies on the faith of the community to function.  
I don't agree at all with the hardline libertarian view, frankly i don't find it preferable for a capitalist kingpin to screw me over the government screwing me. Bitcoin avoids the need for government oversight, but at the same time encourages a decentralized network that avoids consolidation of power.

I know with Coinbase's merchant solutions, you have the option where the price in bitcoin is automatically set to a dollar amount you select in advance, and the exchange rate is updated.  Once the bitcoin are sent, they're immediately converted so the merchant always receives the dollar value. 
Coinbase's system is a bit rough, as I believe it forces consumers to make a coinbase account, rather than just sending bitcoin to a unique receiving address, but it's a step in the right direction.  Bitcoin should be a base layer, upon which easier trading platforms are built.  There is so much room for innovation, exciting times!

I think that at this point in time you need to know the basic principles of public and private key cryptography to make sure you don't make a very costly error.  This is very different from macro or micro economics, all those sciences do is attempt to explain behavior that human's otherwise find intuitive (pursuing wants and needs). 
Asymmetrical crypto is the reason why you can provide receiving addresses to other people without giving them your private key / all your money.  Maybe you don't need to know how to apply a one-time-pad or something like that, but I think everyone should at least understand how public key crypto, at a very high level, works.  
In the future as people develop more business solutions to bridge the technological divide it will be less important, but at this point in time I think knowing how public key crypto works is essential for anyone involved in Bitcoin.

that's true, I was expecting a huge downward correction today, people finally are starting to realize every $5 is not a reason to go running to the hills and give up on the concept

Offering 1$ tip for translation

Very interesting perspective.  I hold some Bitcoin now, but wouldn't call myself a speculator as I"m fully willing to let them drop down to a $1 now before selling. I've been buying Bitcoin for the purpose of sending them to friends (pay back bar tabs etc.)and contributing to organizations like reddit that I believe.  
I have a question though.  If you are a believer in the long-term usability of bitcoin, surely once the market matures to the point where many consumers are spending bitcoin and many merchants accept them, the market cap will be much higher. As the cap increases, will Bitcoin ever hit a sort of "sweet spot" from a wall-street investor's perspective?  
What I mean is, right now you say that Bitcoin's market cap is too low for a Wall-Street investor to even bother.  In the distance future, I would expect (if the bitcoin experiment is successful), that the market-cap will be much larger than that of a penny-stock.  During that in between period, would Bitcoin not be an easy target for a pump-and-dump attack?

if you're an investor that primarily deals in purchasing bucket's of kfc chicken, i would think it would be of interest to you that another possible investment might have better growth potential

He was able to raise money more easily because of the convenience of bitcoin.

They also seized 3.2 million worth of bitcoin, is that enough of a contraction in supply to drive up prices?

Are your transactions going through slower than mine using Bitcoin QT on default settings?  
If i can still do business with Bitcoin I would definitely change it, but I also don't want to lose my ability to send Bitcoin at all
@_date: 2013-03-29 02:58:38
No, they are not offering bitcoin in exchange for bank transfers of pounds anymore.  
I'm not in the UK, but from what I understand, anyone who has bitcoin can still spend those
@_date: 2013-04-08 04:53:17
Sure but there are plenty of people trading bitcoin who don't go on here and can barely wrap their heads around the concept of Bitcoin, let alone all the fine details.  As long as those people are sending around money offering the higher fees, my transactions look comparatively worse.  
I don't think a 'petition' is necessary, but we should disseminate the information so that other bitcoin users will be able to act rationally, and transaction fees will reach a market clearing price.

I agree with the general sentiment of your point, but want to clarify one thing.  
BitPay is pretty much essential for a company that needs to very quickly send revenue back through the supply chain to replenish inventory, etc.  If you own a burger joint, you need to be able to receive a predictable amount of money, and you need to be able to use that money very quickly to buy more burger ingredients.  This makes BitPay ideal, as your revenue is both predictable (you know exactly how much you get for each burger sold) and easy to spend almost immediately. 
For OP however, if he's just trying to make a little extra money / offset the purchase price, accepting Bitcoin directly may not be a bad move.  Even if there is a huge daily price swing, OP may be in a situation where he's able to wait for the price to come back up before spending it.

I thought about suggesting that, but personally if I had a million dollars I would be weary of putting it in Bitcoin.  
If he were to do it though, I think it'd be easier to just encrypt a file and email it to himself, and memorize the pass phrase.

Simpson's mentioned Bitcoin?? was that last night??

I don't recall the leveling period lasting this long though, it's been over 100 for about 3 weeks now.  I could be wrong

that's a good idea, an upper layer service that facilitates microtransactions, where users can pay off a monthly balance with bitcoin and the service would guarantee their microtransactions.  
i know it sounds suspciously like a credit card company, but these types of 3rd party services need to become popular for bitcoin to go mainstream

Worry me? No. I didn't buy into bitcoin for it's stability, stability will arrive as it becomes more commonly used.  It is a fact that thicker markets are more prone to volatility, and as more and more ways to spend Bitcoin arise, transactional demand will increase, bringing about more non-speculating entrants to the market and more stability / resistance to these fluctuations. 
Bitcoin will be completely stable for weeks before experiencing these fluctuations, and since I can't predict them, I don't let them effect my purchasing habits.  Some times it works out to my benefit and sometimes it doesn't. 
I can't predict the future, so I don't know which way the fluctuations are gonna go, but I do know that in the long run, it will tend to gain in value as long as my predictions about the infrastructure around it continuing to develop are accurate.

... Are you a wizard?  Import worked perfectly this time.
I am happy that I could load my wallet, but I would like to know why this happened in the first place.

Additionally, you could even include a transaction fee in your price (make it known to them), or a tiering price.  A group that doesn't have anywhere to go may be more willing to hang around, whereas a group in a hurry may pay up to a dollar to have their transaction confirmed immediately

You don't need to jailbreak to get the Blockchain app, and it lets you send Bitcoin through QR codes.
