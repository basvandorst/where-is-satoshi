Your last statement is absolute wisdom.  Bitcoin development shouldn't get distracted by trying to displace existing systems, it should be focused on creating new capabilities for money.
@_date: 2015-06-16 01:06:05
The biggest threat to Bitcoin are not governments or existing banking systems.
The biggest threats are internal: the slowness of protocol improvement and the focus on trying to beat existing systems that actually work quite well (consumer and business transactions) instead of providing completely new capabilities (the world of efficient microtransactions is wide open).
I.e. Bitcoin should be operating like a startup by moving fast and aiming at new capabilities where there is no competition.  That is how change happens.
Once Bitcoin succeeds at entirely new uses for money, it will have a much easier time displacing older types of money for older types of transactions.  But that should not be the definition of success early on.

I would fine tune that a bit.
The problem is not who has an absolute need to run a full node (as you point out), but also not who has a right to (which would include everyone on the planet regardless of how little resources they have).
The best way to find make tradeoffs between transmission speed vs. cost of running full nodes, is to determine whether proposed transmission speed improvements increase the cost of running a node so that too few nodes remain available to meet a specific target level of security for the Bitcoin system.
It would be great to make these tradeoff decisions could be made in reference with hard (as possible) numbers about speed enhancements, costs of running nodes with those enhancements, and some well defined definition of the numbers of nodes required to maintain clearly defined target security level.

Simple Explanation for most people: Bitcoin is (a) digital money, (b) for the internet.
Old people have experienced the digitization of documents, music, video, commerce and communication.  They have seen the internet go from nothing used by nobody to the whole internet being in their phone and used by almost everyone.  So they should get this explanation pretty easily.
How to explain to them how to reliably use Bitcoin?  Not sure anyone that needs a lot of help using it should be yet.
How to explain to them the value of the Bitcoin system, and therefore Bitcoin as an investment?  Not sure that anyone who has to be convinced to invest in something volatile is a good person to be doing that investment, and volatility is not a friend to anyone investing on (relatively) short horizons without time to recover any losses.  I.e. money isn't happiness, freedom from worry is happiness. So introducing high risk even with likely high return is not the right move for most retirees.

Volatile currencies cannot be used as unit of account for extended transactions, i.e. when returns are possible.  If they were used the vendor would get gamed out of business.
The same would be true of dollars if it became highly volatile.  Vendors would either have to reduce the return period, eliminate returns, or move to another unit of account.
There is zero chance Bitcoin will be used as unit of account for any reversible transaction until it becomes extremely stable, which is at least a decade away, even with an optimistic outlook.

Velocity means the same money is quickly available for more transactions, which means the same number of units of money do more work, or conversely that fewer currency units are needed for any given number of transactions.  This lowers the price of the currency unit.
The benefits of velocity are that they mean productivity is maximized because lots of transactions per time mean a lot of value being created in trades.  But the value being increased is not the value of the currency, it is the value of products and services as they are quickly transferred to owners who value them the most.

Network protocols are incredibly difficult to unseat once they have been widely adopted because switching costs of even trivial changes are colossal.

While you are right about the Gini value for Bitcoin, your last statement makes no sense whatsoever.
Central banks control money supply without paying the normal cost. They can lend money that didn't previously exist.  Nobody can do that with Bitcoin.  Anyone can be there own banker, which is a change in favor of poor people.  Nobody gets to be a central bank, another change in favor of poor people.
What this means is the initially unequal distribution of Bitcoin is a one time occurrence that will reduce over time.  As Bitcoin settles on a stable price (which may not happen for 10 years or so), large holders of Bitcoin will have an incentive to diversify their Bitcoin holdings to other investments, slowly reducing this inequality.
Bitcoin will not solve inequality, but it does remove a few non-value generating motivations for inequality: Unequal regular bank access and unequal access to central banking.

Agreed.  Another incentive for the rich to spend Bitcoin is to diversify.  Rich people tend to manage their wealth well and diversification is extremely important to protecting it.
While the short term effect of many people suddenly sitting on money is discontinuously deflationary and therefore a disincentive to invest savings in growth, this is only a temporary effect.
As the money supply shrinks it then responds by deflating, i.e. increasing in value. This increases the amount of value circulating for investments and transactions again.
Most problems with pure market solutions to money occur only when there are sudden large changes (everyone suddenly starts hoarding, or everyone suddenly wants to spend or exchange their currency at the same time), but work themselves out naturally for slow changes, small changes and in the long run.  (And nobody has invented a money system yet that has no problems.)

Thanks for pointing out the propagation issues.  That does complicate my "simple" suggestion.
I would think for Bitcoin to scale to economy size there will eventually need to be some way for independent blocks to be mined in parallel without orphaning each other.  Perhaps blocks could be divided into non-overlapping blockchain tracks based on the last digits of their ID,  or something else.  If they were divided into separate tracks based on transaction size that would kill two birds with one stone.  A third bird is that multiple tracks would reduce the statistical variance for individual miners, reducing the incentive for centralization.
The issue of block rewards vs. transaction fees is interesting.  Block rewards were a good idea to bootstrap mining but don't respond to market forces so are leaving a lot of efficiency on the table. My hope is that some kind of miner "ask" vs spender "bid" will allow transaction fees to adjust according to supply and demand forces, encouraging maximum efficiency, removing arbitrary pricing from miner rewards.
But all these ideas do indeed complicate what I hoped was a complete "simple" suggestion.
I am passionate about micro transactions because:
1) I am a developer and would be putting them to use yesterday if Bitcoin supported them economically.
2) It is clear that microtransactions can be economical.  Bitcoin's transaction cost (for miners) is very high to make large transactions secure, but small transactions could be protected just as well by proportionally lower cost.
3) Bitcoin still has not found its killer app, it is being adopted mostly for its latent potential right now.  Microtransaction efficiency would immediately create a killer app and Bitcoin use would explode with real transactions.
4) A side chain could do microtransactions, but Bitcoin's main advantage (in my mind) is that it enables new forms of commerce,  and micro transactions are exactly that.  Relatively speaking, making old forms of commerce just a little more efficient is a sideshow in comparison to the benefits of enabling new things.

Bitcoin will do well once it enables something entirely new.  That is how disruptive technologies win.
It comes down to focus.  New technologies and startups succeed best when they do something new very very well.  Not when they try and do a lot a little better.
If a technology or startup tries to simply replace an entrenched system with something a bit more efficient, the older system just adapts.  It is already doing a good job, it doesn't actually take much effort to do better.  For instance Apple Pay appears like a radical change, but delivers better security, privacy and convenience simply by tweaking how the existing credit card system works.
However, if Bitcoin enabled efficient micropayments, or any other major new money feature, then it would "win" immediately in that area as it would be the only tool that was available.  It could then spread its dominance in one area to others.
That is how disruption works.

If block difficulty were set relative to the total block's transaction value, the miners costs and fees would be aligned for both small and large transactions.
I.e. a block of small transactions would require small difficulty so be cheap for miners and allow them to make money even with very small transaction fees.
A block of large transaction fees would have a higher difficulty, making it more secure from double spending, and the larger fees of the large transactions would pay for the extra effort.
Like most things in economics, properly aligning costs solves problems both large and small.

Inflation happens when the money supply increases, but deflation happens when more people try to use the same quantity of money.
For the foreseeable future, the percentage increases in available Bitcoins will be much less than the percentage increases in the number of people using Bitcoin.
Both growth factors will decrease over time, but I expect the percentage of new Bitcoins will decrease faster.
Therefore: Bitcoin will be deflationary for all of our lifetimes.

This is great!  I realize its a version 1.0 situation regarding the coverage not tracking Bitcoin value, but here are suggestions for the future:
Use Bitcoin's flexibility for accurate small transactions: Instead of charging monthly, charge each day, with fiat coverage automatically updating for Bitcoin value changes.  This way (a) you can still record the coverage amount for Lloyd's in fiat terms as you do now, but (b) that coverage will track Bitcoin value, and (c) the daily fee will remain a fixed percentage in Bitcoins.
A minimum fee could still cover your costs where someone didn't use their account for a full month.
Also, I assume as time goes by you will be able to offer better rates.  I expect your security is near perfect, given Bitcoin inherently is secure when managed properly.

Whatever other problems there are to solve, making difficulty proportional to transaction size is an obvious way to incentivize miners equally to validated many small transactions as for validating a few large transactions.

@_date: 2014-08-25 17:55:54
Someone could have said that the Internet does not have the security for digital money a few years ago.  Someone else decided not to stop there.  Stating that something doesn't do something now doesn't mean it can't be fixed.  If anything should be economically cheap it should be sending small amounts of digital money (i.e. small numbers!) over the internet.
The cost/difficulty of transactions is set by an algorithm for security/validation purposes, it is not inherent in the computing.  So this should be EASY to fix.
1) Small transactions do not need as much proof-of-work difficulty to disincentivize attempts to double spend/split the block chain, because they provide less potential for ill gotten gain.
2) Therefore, by making block difficulty proportional to total transaction size, smaller transactions become cheaper (and micro transactions become micro cheap!) without losing any security.
3) Everybody wins when the cost of transactions (to both miners and transactees) are proportional to transaction size.

Good question, I mean that the difficulty level for a block would be proportional to the total transaction sizes of that block.
A block that aggregated lots of small transactions would not require the same hash difficulty as a block that aggregated lots of large transactions.  
This makes transaction cost proportional to transaction size, which of course make transaction security proportional to transaction size (since difficulty is set to establish security).  Both of these are desirable economic efficiencies.

Poor people have as much access to mining as rich people, in the sense that a dollar from a poor person is as good for purchasing mining equipment as a dollar from a rich person. That rich people have more money and can therefore buy more mining equipment does not mean mining is tilted in their favor, just that they have more money.
In contrast, not only can rich people buy more investments in the fiat economy, (for the valid reason that they have more money) but they can take advantage of the central banks money games to suck value from the system in ways poor people simply cannot do, because it is very much a crony system based on business relationships that poor people have no access to at all.

If he did dump his money he would suddenly be as poor as the rest of us.  No way could he sell even a tiny fraction of what he owns in a short period before it was all worth 0.

Let's say 1% of people in a country with an unstable currency adopt Bitcoin. This initial investment is made by the educated, mid-class to wealthier people, as the article points out, as they can speculate on Bitcoin as being the future currency.  This leads to a downturn in the local currency and then capital starts flying into Bitcoin (from the perspective of a small country Bitcoin actually represents a gateway to every stable currency in the world) and the local currency collapses completely.
Now 99% of merchants, consumers, workers ... 99% of people, will not yet have adapted to using Bitcoin.  Their cash and cash based savings will be worthless.  They will not have accounting and computer systems set up to handle Bitcoin.  Even if they all try to sign up with a provider like Coinbase on day 1, it will take months or a year before everyone has learned how to operate with Bitcoin, and they have no valuable cash to buy any!  In the meantime, their customers have lost their cash too, so how do they earn any?  Its a very vicious cycle.
You are right to point out this is not a situation that has happened before.  Currency collapses have caused mass economic wreckage many times before, but Bitcoin takes friction out of situation where friction actually helped ease change, and is not simply replacing an unstable fiat with stable fiat as has happened before.  It requires everyone to suddenly change how they get, save and spend cash completely.  Trying to do that suddenly with millions of people in a large city dependent on efficient transfer of goods, who have just lost their own cash, is a disaster.
Its like someone invented a new kind of electricity, then before most people had the chance to adapt their dwellings wiring, or their appliances, the old electric grid is suddenly turned off and they have to figure out how to transition WITHOUT the old grid to support them.

Good point.


Yes, that would be the solution.


The block reward is distributed when a block is solved, as it is now.  Just some blocks with smaller transaction sizes will get solved sooner.  Base difficulty is set as it is now, but is applied as a multiplier on total block transaction size.  So there would be no additional centralization or coordination, just a change from a constant difficult to a proportional difficulty.
You are right, a maximum difficulty makes sense. Maximum difficulty cost could be assigned some transaction size.  For instance, any transaction of 10 BTC or more could be treated as a 10 BTC transaction for purposes of setting a block's difficulty.


Since difficulty is set proportional to transaction size, but reward is also proportional to transaction size, there is no greater incentive for mining ones own transactions than there is now. Base difficulty would be set so that gaming the chain is unprofitable as it is now.


Right up to here I found your comments insightful, helpful, polite and enjoyable.  WTF.  Thank you for them anyway.

Contradicts this:


The Federal Reserve does control the money supply when they reduce interest rates by allowing banks to borrow *NEW* money at lower interest rates than the market would set naturally.  This creates money supply that did not exist in any bank deposit and reduces the value of the dollar through inflation.
It is also a system that produces profits for banks at cost to the entire country.  Banks have been known to borrow from the Federal Reserve and then lend to the US Government at a higher rate, effectively getting free money from the tax payer while also devaluing everyone's money.

Satoshi took the bitcoins and the proof of work, looked up toward heaven, and cryptographically signed them. Then, breaking the new bitcoins into 100,000,000 pieces each, he gave them to the miners so they could distribute them to the people without third party intervention.

I agree.  An alternatives is we could have parties, but they could have checks and balances:
* have seat limits (10%!)
* term limits (can't hold the same seat longer than two terms!)
* and not be able to operate on both federal and state level.
If parties were limited, suddenly we would have a lot more diversity of choices in government and no single group could monopolize or duopolize government.  New movements, new ideas, and even individuals would have a much better chance of being heard.
Also each state would really go back to experimenting again, so states could learn from each other.  Very hard to learn when the country makes mistakes lockstep as a whole.  Nothing to compare it to.

Bitcoin is volatile, and will continue to be volatile, because nobody knows for sure what the Bitcoin system will be worth in objective terms in the future.  There is no conceivable regulation that could remove that volatility.
As long as the scale of Bitcoin's future success is a big unknown, its price is going to go up and down like a roller coaster.  That is the nature of pricing something that has not reached a stable level of usage that can be valued objectively.

Eaglecoin would be a great "altname" for Bitcoin with US conservatives.  Politicians could proudly declare they accepted Eaglecoin and sound patriotic instead of educated or techy.  It would be more politically costly for conservatives to talk about high handed regulation for Eaglecoins.
If Bitcoin had an altname feature that let people rename coins they accepted, without actually having any technical effect on Bitcoin value or the Bitcoin system, a lot of groups would start promoting themselves to their cultural groups with their "versions".
"Eaglecoin", "Westcoin", "Eastcoin", "Envirocoin", "Putincoin", ...

I think its pretty simple: If Bitcoin meets some clear need that other currencies do not, it will be very successful.
But if Bitcoin only tries to compete as a more efficient means of doing the same things that other currencies and systems do, it will be somewhat successful, but the older systems will become more efficient in response.  Apple for instance is improving both efficiency, security and reducing costs of payments.
Micropayments would be a clear case of Bitcoin delivering something completely new that could enable new kinds of products and services.  But its not been a priority.

I would say years.
No stalled tech has lasted years with active competition and Bitcoin's stalled throughput and privacy problems are already pushing interest in alternatives.
1. An alt-coint solves Bitcoins scalability, delay, high transaction cost and privacy problems and becomes a well accepted  sidechain while people continue using Bitcoin for value storage.
2. Once that  chain is widely accepted for regular transactions with low fees, it provides a mechanism for burning Bitcoin coins in exchange for newly minted coins in the  currency with 1-to-1 value preserved.  Bitcoin is no longer needed, as it doesn't provide anything unique and handicapped its own network value by not fixing its problems.
That's just one scenario.

Network effects (for protocols or any other technology) are a formidable advantage, but they are not an invincible shield against the need to continue to solve problems promptly and continually innovate.
After all, the fiat system currently has the largest network effect, but its limits make it vulnerable.
Competitors always appear in the margins, finding their own niches.  And if the major network stalls in solving problems and innovating, eventually the network effects of a smaller competitor will reach a threshold.  This has happened over and over in the history of network-benefiting tech whether we are talking about protocols, social networks, marketplaces, or platforms. 
To top it off, the existence of Bitcoin&lt;--&gt;fiat and Bitcoin&lt;--&gt;alt-coin exchanges has lowered the barrier for alt-coins to find their own niches.  Bitcoin cannot stand still or be chronically handicapped by unsolved problems and expect users won't eventually move to another network.  These changes can take a while, but then happen very suddenly.

That is true.  But most transactions and commerce in the world are for much smaller amounts.  At one point Bitcoin facilitated that, currently it no longer does.

Exactly.  The developers working on Bitcoin should be making it efficient for everything from micro transactions to large transactions.  That would set the world on fire.
Microtransactions in particular would create new use cases for currency that no fiat could emulate. It would guarantee global adoption as basic services on the Internet became available that charged microfees per hour or day.
The international transfer use case is a good one too, but companies already do that.  Doing something brand new (in addition to just trying to be better at old things) is a much better way of gaining adoption.

The reason for having a 1MB block limit had nothing to do with stopping scaling.  It was to stop spam transactions, i.e. large numbers of transactions with zero (or nearly zero) fees attempting to swamp the system.
Now that fees have become common place,  all miners need to do is set minimum fees to avoid spam.
If Bitcoin can't match VISA something is deeply wrong.  Bitcoin is capable of scaling with block sizes and other optimizations to handle more transactions than VISA as was pointed out by Satoshi and many others since.

Well there are a lot of factors so even nonlinear expression models are too simple (as you likely agree).
I agree scaling blocksizes will not "solve" the scaling problem.  The nonlinear relationship means block increases in response to improved resource efficiencies will run up against diminishing returns.
But that doesn't make them worthless. That would still add significant scaling for a few years.
Further means of scaling can include blockchain pruning mechanisms, perhaps tree structures of block validation that reduce the order of communication costs, or eventually more radical changes such as MimbleWimble type ledgers where only the current state needs to be maintained.
And off-chain or 2nd level solutions are an area with lots of potential.  
A tiered system is inevitable and desirable.
In the meantime, moderate block increases are simple and effective changes.

I think a third aspect is how functional is the management of two companies.  Whether they are really competitors, or just alternate investments, if one is making faster progress and has less infighting, it seems likely it will do better in the long run.
Even if a management style is not as ideologically attractive, even if they seem to be taking the "wrong" approach, being able to execute matters most.
For a long time, frustrated Apple fans watched Microsoft kill it even though they thought its products were crappier, its ideals almost non-existent, etc.  But Microsoft was working its ass off while Apple's leadership was a mess.

The only way our DNA will adapt, and our decision making strategies as a species will change,  is if there is strong selection (lots of death), we change our DNA artificially, or we turn over decision making to smarter machines when those are available.

Then identify situations where these triggers are in full effect, and where they are not.  All those things have been more and less triggers at different times and places.
Then figure out what those inherently tribal aspects are, and if crypto is an outlier or part of a pattern.

Why China news is positive:
If there is a new breed of weed in a field with power to grow, the only bad news for the weed is that someone is covering its first field with poison to kill it all off.  Any small amount of poison, which lets it live, will only make it stronger and give it time to spread beyond anyone's ability to stamp out.
If a new bacteria infects someone, with some innate capability of spreading to others, the only bad news for the bacteria is if someone takes antibiotics for long enough to kill it all.  If someone takes some antibiotics, but not enough to kill it, it self-selects to be even stronger.  It is much more likely to become an uncontrollable strain.
This is true of bitcoin because:
1) Bitcoin is new, it is not strong enough or evolved enough for everyone to "catch" it (i.e. find it indispensable) yet.
2) Bitcoin, however, has the potential to benefit almost everyone on the planet with new efficiencies and the blockchain can provide new transaction safety of all kinds.  Given time, Bitcoin will adapt (people will build in controls and friendly tools for it) so that it everyone will catch it (want to use it).
3) Therefore, anything that only temporarily limits its growth, especially for sensible reasons (not making it available to the wider public who is not ready for it yet) will encourage everyone who has a stake in Bitcoin to continue improving it.  Therefore, when it does go mainstream it will be ready for it.
So yes, anything which does not kill Bitcoin will make it stronger.  Growth is not Bitcoins problem, there are clear reasons why Bitcoin will grow.  But growing up strong is necessary, and temporary limitations and some degree of pushback will ensure it grows up strong.
Also, the fact that China decided deliberately to limit it but NOT stamp it out suggests something clearly positive: They are not stamping it out.  They have that option, they know they have that option, and they are passing on it.

The US government could create official crypto-dollars with some of the benefits of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin has a network value system, so it will either fail spectacularly due to some "extinction" event, or succeed wildly.  (There is a very small chance that something similar could co-opt it slowly, but not likely as most features people have talked about can be grafted onto Bitcoin later).
If it succeeds in becoming the first globally accepted digital currency it is going to be a trillion dollar system (fiat is $55 trillion and growing every year, gold is $6 trillion).  Let's say $21 trillion is really optimistic but possible.  That would make each bitcoin worth $1 million.
So as long as you are willing to wait for 5, 10, 20 years, and if Bitcoin does succeed, you will be very happy.
If it fails, it won't matter how many bitcoins you got for your money, because they are all going to be worthless.
Now if you are trying to make a fast buck, then I have no idea if $700 is a good price.  Nobody knows, playing volatile assets is just gambling.

Bitcoin can only be technically inhibited by very intrusive government control of your computer equipment.  If they are doing that, they can also have you walk through metal detectors to get your gold.
The big difference is that bitcoin, from a practical (not political) standpoint can be used without anyone's permission.  Both would have problems if politics outlawed them.
But there is not going to be a competition between bitcoin and gold.  Gold remains a good diversification of value from fiat, and it will remain a good diversification of value even if bitcoin becomes the default world currency.  As long as wedding rings convince people to pay far more than gold's material utility is worth, it will be a remain a good store of value.

Yes, if Bitcoin really becomes a mainstream currency and there are only 21 million, they are going to be worth at least $1000 each!  Oh wait... :)
Actually there is about $55 trillion dollars (of cash and electronic money in all fiat currencies) in the world (and growing).  Essentially that means the world demands $55 trillion in liquidity to operate.  If in some fantasy Bitcoin replaced all currency tomorrow, then each Bitcoin would need to be worth $5,000,000 (not accounting for new coins) to enable trade to continue unimpeded.
Will Bitcoins total speculation value get so far ahead of its real value as a means of transaction that there is a crash? Or will it replace all other money at some point?  Or both? Nobody knows!

Competition is generally good, but in this case there are big disadvantages to not quickly rallying around a single standard.  Each new currency dilutes the value of all other currencies.  If new currencies continue popping up, then nobody can store value in any one currency due to rapid inflation.
Some things, like the internet, only work well when everyone rallies around one standard.  Research into better networks and currencies will always be a good thing.  But in both cases, it is better to move from one standard to the next only when there are very good benefits to doing so (like going from IPv4 to IPv6) as the disruption has major costs.
Right now bitcoin is clearly in the lead.  It is unlikely that features of other currencies cannot be carefully added to its system, as demand requires.  Until some new feature becomes absolutely necessary, which cannot be implemented on top of the bitcoin system, it is better economically to stick with the existing winner.
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:46:51
This is not really true.  Spending is just the flip side of employment.  Less spending means less employment.
What is best for both humanity and capitalism is not less spending, but *less unwise* spending.
Careful spending means:
1) You just got something valuable (a necessity, a useful thing, a memorable experience)
2) You just rewarded others for creating something valuable
3) You are directing the productive capacity of the market toward creating valuable things, which are likely to provide the best economic growth.
After all, spending/earning is just a mechanism for how we all cooperate to create more value together than we could by ourselves.  More wise cooperation is good on all levels.
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:13:10
The deflationary attribute of bitcoins just means that people who do not spend their money will receive some of the economic growth which their unspent money allows.  This is like always having your cash in a money market fund.
Your money is essentially an IOU from the economy that you provided some value and you can call some value back when you want.  "Lending" that money to the economy by not spending it allows that value to be used by others until you call it.  You SHOULD receive interest (in the form of deflation) for that.
Note that this attribute would be true of fiat too, if it were not for governments printing new money at everyone's expense.
The limited number of bitcoins will incentivize saving.  A bitcoin (if it became the currency of the world) provides a simple investment in the whole economy.  That only seems odd because we are used to governments continually devaluing currency.

You are absolutely right, sir.
Fixing arbitrage is a really good reason to have a silver coin to complement the gold.  Fixing arbitrage would have helped people move dollars out of Mt Gox without taking the 10-15% hit caused by their slow liquidity.
Also, as long as the second coin has some real advantage over bitcoin that enough people care about (like zerocoin anonymity), there will be at least a second currency.  This is for exactly the same reason bitcoin was able to grow even as a very sketchy marginal currency - because a very small fraction of the world found it useful.

No you didn't really say anything except express a feeling that bitcoin is irrational.
There are lots of reasons to think bitcoin has a lot of rationality behind it.  More efficient internet transactions.  An incredible exit tool for people in countries with artificially controlled (China) or unstable (Lots of places) local currencies.  A global currency for cross world transactions.  Simple way to transfer money between friends.  List goes on.
Then add to all this value, which is clearly growing, the fact that the world needs a digital currency for the digital age, and Bitcoin would appear to be able to fulfill that role.
Now note that bitcoin has a maximum coin limit.  This means that whatever the world's digital currency ends up being worth (and non-digital currencies in physical and electronic form are currently worth over $55 trillion), the bitcoin market is only valued at around $12 billion right now.  As the bitcoin market becomes a useful tool on par with other currencies its total value, and therefore the value of every bitcoin (since they are a fixed percentage of the bitcoin system) could still go up 1000 times (say over the next 10-20 years).
Lots of rational exuberance to be had.   There is risk, bitcoin could fail, but clearly there are reasons it will either succeed or something like it will.  Right now bitcoin is clearly in front of this inevitable transition.

I strongly agree with everything you say about Bitcoin's (and the block chain's) profound advantages and its utility for mankind.
Where we differ is that you are ignoring the real risk of setbacks or shutdown.  Huge numbers of innocent people are regularly killed in this world.  Many good ideas have also been squashed and delayed before they finally achieved their destiny.
If the US and Chinese governments get psyched they could quickly put up barriers for Bitcoin use and exchange, and set bad precedents for other countries to follow.  This could quickly cause an irreversible crash of Bitcoin value as everyone tried to get out, and subsequently, merchants and other mainstream businesses would avoid being associated with all that damage.
However, I think we would agree that even if Bitcoin crashed, something similar or better will quickly appear, and eventually find a way to obsolete fiat.  And I do think Bitcoin has a good chance of riding through the bumps and winning out.  That's why I have Bitcoins!

A second currency is both inevitable and useful because:
1. A second crypto currency solves the arbitration problem that currently exists because fiat money is to slow and costly to use to eliminate discrepancies between exchanges.  Therefore, if a second currency is available arbitrators will use is it all the day long.  Just you try and pry it from their dead cold fingers!
2. A second crypto currency solves the problem of poor fiat liquidity on any exchange.  Can't get your exchange to send your dollars (or euros, ...) fast enough? Turn them back into crypto currency and move it out - but with the peace of mind that dual-crypto currency arbitrage will prevent the exchange from jacking up the price of crypto money.  This is real peace of mind!
3. Just as bitcoin managed to grow even when it was sketchy and untested, because it provided special features unobtainable elsewhere, it will be even easier for a second currency with real advantages to operate successfully.   It will only take a tiny fraction of the world that needs really private transactions to make zerocoin or something like it successful, just as it only took a tiny fraction of the planet to make Bitcoin successful.  Different tools are needed for different jobs.  (Litecoin doesn't seem to provide any truly new features, but other currencies will.)

When rich people sell vast assets they sell in blocks to large purchasers outside the regular exchanges.  This lets them get a good price without pushing the price down.
For instance, if Bill Gates died and his estate needed to sell $10 billion of Microsoft Stock to pay his estate tax, they would round up investors who wanted to get $10 billion of Microsoft stock without pushing the price *up* and sell to them.
If they could only find purchasers for $5 billion then they would sell $5.5 billion to a large investor that didn't really want Microsoft stock for $5 billion.  That investor would then slowly sell the stock back into the market so as not to push down the price for a $500 million profit.
