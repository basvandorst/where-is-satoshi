The thing is, they were previously producing fpgas, and at the start of preorder acceptance had yet to have a designed ASIC. Maybe something's has change recently I've missed, but a September ship date is extremely hopeful in my opinion. 
Then you must consider Avalon,BFL,bit fury etc shipping out chips and miners in that timeframe. Just playing devils advocate here as I have money invested in multiple places. It strikes me as an odd occurrence they started with 350/175 gh/s models and are moving to a 100gh/s machine now...

Invest that money or send it to a cold storage wallet. 
You'd be better off waiting a couple months and seeing how the state of mining progresses before dropping that amount of coin on any mining rigs.

Ill gladly help!

Have you heard anything about market manipulation with that? I bought low but it all seems very fishy, did you see some of those low sales. 
Something isn't right...

Outdoor adventure and gear you say? Ill have to look around for anything which could be of use for motocamping!
Great move taking bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-07-06 16:18:35
It'd be nice to have a btc discount but I suppose they've got to cover business/production costs. 
They do offer a 5% discount to redditors though so that's cool. 
@_date: 2013-07-23 16:34:33
Care to explain further? Sounds like some fluff. 
@_date: 2013-07-25 22:47:54
So aka he lost the private key to a cold storage wallet?
@_date: 2013-06-14 20:50:17
Just paid through coin base, nice little system setup. Hopefully it all works out. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 01:07:21
I understand the jump from fpga to ASIC but is more like a leap when you don't have the experience. I didn't know they already had existing orders. I was slightly worried that big boy companies using the same chip size 28/22 (whatever they're using) - like intel, amd, etc  would be given first priority considering the amount of chips/revenue brought in from such companies. 
I suppose I meant odd as in, if you're already producing such fast hashing miners, why go backwards (in my mind) with a lower performing machine especially when it'll be delivered later and the difficulty will only be rising. It doesn't seem like a competitive move.

Thanks josh, I live on the east coast (to anyone wondering about shipping times) and just received my first bitcoin related and bitcoin purchased apparel, all because of Shirtoshi.com. 
The print looks great and the shirt appears to be of high quality, so smooth. 
Ill be placing an order with the thought of passing them along to friends and family in the coming months!

Since so many people are looking, and the only real option being overpriced AsicMiner gear, I'm considering selling my 3 K16s or 8 10 chip over clocked modules when they get delivered in a month or so. 
We are all in this together right, it's best for everyone if we spread the hashrate as much as possible. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 04:56:18
Okay ill give it to you, a decent idea. Great site and hell, I might even use it in the future. 
But doesn't this somewhat undermine the philosophy of no merchant fees for bitcoin? 
I understand its a convenience fee primarily for anonymity and using btc where currently unaccepted, but from my eyes the site is counter ideological to bitcoins...focus? No, maybe freedom? Sounds too strong...
Maybe I'm just missing something or see it a different way. 
@_date: 2013-07-06 17:18:40
I am seriously contemplating buying this just to have as a novelty in my apt. 
So damn tempting!
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:34:01
I held (and still do) shares of the site during the closure of btct, but never really used the site for much. Neotrix and team made the transition quickly and are definitely making strides to become a top contender in crypto trading. 
Once volume starts picking up it'll be exciting to see what becomes of the site. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:34:16
It worked for me after navigating away then refollowing the link he sent me. I guess he just ironed that all out though. 
@_date: 2013-08-14 04:06:18
I'd say if her wallet is already supplied with bitcoins, the old broad would  have no trouble filling out "To", "From" or "Amount."
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:09:47
Why not 10000?
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:39:16
I can't even login right now, my Authy code keeps failing to send.

The "big boys" are going to control roughly 20% of the networks hash rate, although I do agree USB miners will be integral for "decentralization" they won't truly put a dent in the networks total hashing power. 
Regardless I feel introducing people to bitcoin through USB miner "gifts" are an excellent way to spread awareness and ultimately this is the way bitcoin becomes a global currency.

Whoever won the the 3mil satoshi from the previous giveaway?

Just jumping in here as a fellow "youngin", but when I was moving coins around a couple weeks back I allocated some for stocks on btct. Instead of buying an ASICminer share I bought shares of basic mining. Same concept just not nearly as large, you make dividends off them mining. If you look at their history and details page you can see they're small but they pay daily dividends and as of last week or a few days ago there was a bump in btc mined. The spike piqued my interest so I bought a couple more. 
I think if you have some extra btc you're willing to hold off on using or possibly losing (people should still be wary of btc stock exchanges as there is no backing provided by the exchanges) BASIC-mining might impress you over the next couple of months. 
It's nice to get that daily dividend email saying the btc I have laying around made me a few cents. :)
@_date: 2013-07-06 15:36:51
It's pretty much a wash...
They alter the btc amount based on current exchange rate. 
@_date: 2013-07-06 18:46:30
Well I'm glad you got yours! Hopefully they end up being a Bitcoin conversation starter. See the weird thing is my order actually fulfilled the 20 batch minimum so I estimated ~2 weeks for delivery (and I'm on the opposite side of the country from them.)
I suppose I will stop worrying now, thanks for your reply. 
@_date: 2013-07-06 00:06:22
Search this sub for humble bundle. 
@_date: 2013-07-30 21:52:40
Well the guy has definitely worked on some impressive projects thus far. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 22:34:01
Thank you for giving this guy a nice smack of truth in the ass. It's astonishing the amount of trolls in the bitcoin community. I'd say it rivals the troll population per capita of 4chan! /s
But seriously, once greed takes hold, it has the power to turn great men into mere wankers. 
@_date: 2013-07-30 21:57:33
Don't bring logical economics into this argument about rationalized speculation!
@_date: 2013-06-14 21:17:56
Well you didn't have to go take all the fun out of it!
I may not have perused the site enough, but where do the shirts ship from?
@_date: 2013-07-10 02:59:53
Shit I thought he was making the announcement yesterday or today. Well I'm expecting a slight rise before tmrw and a dip after divvys get paid out-which seems like a usual trend. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 20:58:39
I saw it'd be the tipping sale. Actually I may have bought it just to tip the batch lol. Slick sales model/marketing-you got me :p
Already got an email from you guys, site looks good and if all goes well I'm interested in future purchases. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:33:01
Well that was cool, definitely liked the sneak peak of the site. The POS terminal looks great, site is easy to use, and the whole system looks to be really compatible with bitcoin/litecoin. Looks like the terminal and site will be extremely well integrated. 
Do you plan on having some kind of automatic crypto-currency -&gt; fiat process down the road?
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:42:03
Sweet, i appreciate the invite. Ill be on the lookout for news and updates regarding both the terminal and website. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:10:36
The site looks sleek, clean and simple yet informative, if you need another tester let me know. I'd like to see how you handle the registration process. 
Have you recently upgraded servers for the increased traffic?
@_date: 2013-10-11 21:00:46
And lowered power consumption it sounds?
I know everything for KNC isn't going perfect, but you gotta admit they are doing a damn fine job in the short timeframe they committed to and compared to many other ASIC ventures. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:18:25
Tried it out, used caps then switched to lower case. Cleared the error then made another attempt, no error and no verification.
Edit: and I'm through, what's the reasoning for keeping email address' optional? 
@_date: 2013-08-05 21:51:38
Well that certainly is an impressive list, I hope you've found enough use and enjoyment to stick around a little while longer!
@_date: 2013-07-06 18:13:25
Cool that's good news. Do you recall when you placed the order?
@_date: 2013-07-06 18:16:52
Yea im not trying to attack Josh and Andrew, im under the impression they're decent folk (from the little I talked with them) and I know they have been involved with the community for awhile, I just thought I may have seen an update by now. 
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:09:13
How many "employees" exactly do you think BFL has? 
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:11:07
Check out bitcointalk, it goes waaay back. I'm sure lawyers have had plenty of calls. 
@_date: 2013-06-19 03:11:22
Hey BFL thanks for using the testnet!
@_date: 2013-07-22 21:07:08
I was searching for an update today, this is quite why I wanted to hear. :-/
@_date: 2013-08-14 04:07:34
Do we know alias features are not disabled in the Bitcoin protocol?
 
@_date: 2013-07-25 19:51:00
This slightly goes against what a user who talked to Jordan from iacu mentioned the other day. Apparently they were waiting on roman, big surprise. 
In the 4 weeks they "reopened" withdrawals nothing new has been posted, except today's update, which pretty much says "we're working on it, maybe next week but probably longer, and that's only for US users. O and by the way we're doubling the fee."
Well we sure aren't paying for communication or any expediting of funds...not that I'm bashing IACU, I wouldn't be surprised if roman has been dragging his feet. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 22:35:13
Mass purchase/ownership of ASICs defeat decentralization-not the ASIC itself.

Ha facilitating terrorists. 
Meanwhile the US govt funds and runs programs like "Fast and Furious" ( or something similar I believe) which puts guns into the arms of Mexican nationals linked to cartel murders. 
What a fucked position we've found ourselves in.

Maybe in 2014? I kid I kid...

Although I disagree with the picture, I agree with your opinion regarding hardware. 
But still, that diagram is hilarious. 
@_date: 2013-07-31 02:20:30
Nope. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:04:37
I'm interested in knowing what exactly you are testing.
