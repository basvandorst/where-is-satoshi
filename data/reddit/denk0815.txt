Coinbase is not fine. 
They boycotted Segwit for a long time without any reason. Also they scammed millions via insidertrades and please don't forget about all the people who are complaining about problems with withdrawl money.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:43:33
Better question is: What can we do to stop it? 
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:59:04
Great, thanks.
@_date: 2018-01-20 12:11:53
Right. But a using a company like coinbase while there a many good alternatives on the market is not a opinion, it's convenience.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:07:30
Guess kraken.com

Nice guy.
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:56:03
As far as i remember most parts of the community accept it. Except the miners. And Roder Ver.
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:43:31
I would.
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:04:46
Would be pretty cool if can go for this.
Most newbs buy all these shilled shitcoins because they can afford a whole.

Yes, but not him alone.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:48:07
That's the way it goes. Most "traders" are shorting now, but it could be the biggest bear-trap of all time. So many people will get rect soon.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:43:52

@_date: 2018-06-24 11:43:52
No problem at all.   
Everybody with a stable mind should know, that you don't invest in things wich have trippled in the last weeks.   
Also, everybody should know that it can be very profitable to invest in goods, wich have the same (or better) fundamentals like 7 months before but a decrease of value at around 70&amp;

Sorry for the "bitcointrash" but i was not able to post "bitcoincash" without auto-admin deleting the post instantly.

The market already overreacted. Guess the floor will be round about 7500-7600 and stays around that level until a bullish news appears. Could be tomorrows hearing. We should be above 9500 very soon because korean traders will be back on track and there are rumors about some chinese banks are rolling out cryptocurrency ATMs.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:49:27
Right. All these get-rich-quick-idiots will stay away for a long time.

@_date: 2018-02-14 22:44:43
This is the wrong question. It would be better if you asked: Were there more money pulled out by old people as pushed in by new ones?
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:19:25
Or a better version of Bcash.

If you're a true hodler, you have no need to sell. The day will come when you can use cryptos for your daily living purchases.

Wasn't that hard to predict 9k after the public hearing today. But yeah, 11k are possible after the chinese new year ceremony ends and their banks operate again. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:21:48
The 9k resistance felt with low volume after a few day lasting battle. Don't think it was a single entity. May some shorting people who entered at 7k were liquidated.

Your unfriendly attitude to other users will not be helpful to you.
Since you only seem to be in the scene for two weeks, I want to give you a well-intentioned advice:
There are very few experts in this industry. Those who can claim this trait earn their money by investing, not by giving interviews to CNN, CNBC or Forbes.

Schliess nicht von deiner familieren Situation auf andere. 
Ich wohne selbst in der Schweiz und weiss daher zwei Sachen:

2. Wenn man vorschnell beleidigt, hat man schnell eine Buse an der Backe.

Im Übrigen reicht es, wenn du dich einmal unter diesem Usernamen aus der Schweiz eingeloggt hast oder aus die hier verwendete Email-Adresse zugegriffen hast.
Im Allgemeinen bin ich kein nachtragender Mensch - kannst dir ja eine angemessene Entschuldigung einfallen lassen. Bin erst morgen vor der Arbeit bei der Wache.

Wart es ab, 
mir gehen solche Beleidigungen an die Nieren und laut meinem Rechtsbeistand ist das eine schwerwiegende Beleidigung (in zwei Fällen). 
Beweissicherung in Form von Screenshots fand statt und da die ISPs hier in der Schweiz ohnehin alles speichern ist meine Chance gegen dich vorzugehen sehr hoch.
Stell dich auf 120-180 Tagessätze ein.
