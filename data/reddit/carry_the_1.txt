I use GDAX and Bitflyer and it appears bitflyer US is separate from Bitflyer Japan. 24hr trade volume is very low on bitflyer US.

Yeah and if someone screws up the devs can just hardfork the code to undo the screw-up.

Or another ethereum. It goes both ways.

I believe mt fox suspended trading at the moment so you're seeing a frozen price. Once they reopen they'll be on par with the other exchanges.

I had a mid range PSU, OCZ modxstream (I can't remember the wattage but it was probably 650-700W). My mistake was stressing it with 2 GPUs when I originally intended the system to run a single GPU.
After my coil whine (on ocz) got to be too much I upgraded to a Corsair AX850 (seasonic manufactured) 80plus gold PSU. No complaints and should be good through my next mobo/CPU swap.

Mine was a dual GPU setup. I bought 2 cards specifically to mine. When I saw that the hype (and price of a btc) fell, I stopped mining and just used my cards for gaming. I don't game as much as I used to so recently I went back to a single GPU.
During that time I mined a measly 6.5 btc which, until recently, weren't worth selling.

If you run 24/7 it would greatly deteriorate your hardware. You also have to consider cooling. 
I mined for a month about two years ago and basically killed my PSU. It wasn't dead but it was stressed enough to make it unreliable and not supply the right voltages to my system. So consider the cost of maintenance. Nothing is free.
