Ouch. I hope things work out,
@_date: 2014-03-09 15:24:02
I don't want to know. I think it's etter not to try to find out now.
@_date: 2014-01-08 14:11:28
If it prohibits bitcoins then it also prohibits the euro, the pound etc.

I have used them the past but now I use takeaway.com entirly becuase I can pay with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 19:38:36
That's not shorting...
@_date: 2014-05-27 15:49:44
Ugh. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 10:43:17
Yeah I've ordered indian food takeaway from takeaway.com in the UK and paid with bitcoin a few times. Worked great :)
@_date: 2014-01-10 11:09:57
I'm from the UK so this didn't interest me directly. But I had a look eventually and it popped up a thing saying that they will deliver to the UK and the payment screen will include all delivery charges and taxes and duties. Quite impressed. Most places when you buy from the US don't want to know about duties and it's the a lottery how much you'll get charged and when and how much of a extra cost the courier will demand for paying it for you!

The sad thing is that 90% of the poeple I've shown this to have sided with the bank and said that the customers were basically being troublemakers for not just answering the questions. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:42:33
Same here, I'd like to run one, but the blockchain is way too big (and ongoing bandwidth is an issue too)
@_date: 2014-03-10 10:07:00
I have 2BTC now but I would consider that I wouldn't want more than about 2% of my investments in bitcoin, it's great but too risky.
I plan to buy more though. and want to see it used for transactions too.
The way I do this is to have a small wallet I use for purchases, for example I can buy from takeaway.com. Each time it gets low I buy some more BTC to restock it and in addition buy an extra 0.1 that I move to my offline wallet for long term.
That way I'm using it for purchases and slowly building up some wealth stored in it it too.
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:54:12
It'a all about the amount. $5 I'd put anywhere, $20 I'd put out of plain sight. $100 I'd put hidden away, $250 I'd put somewhere a bit more obscure like under a materess :)  $500 I'd put in a small safe. $1000 I'd want a proper safe. $5000 I'd pay someone to store them securely (like a bank...) {Ignoring issues with banks of course but you get the idea]

I don't for a moment believe there is anothing wrong with Sean's Outpost although as a general comment I can't argue with the advice to check out any charity you donate to before doing so.
It would be nice if more charities of this kind would accept bitcoin and publicise it though. I'm sure sean's output does good work, but I'd be much more likely to donate to a similar charity in my own country
@_date: 2014-01-30 12:57:56
We seem to be able to prove that people stole cash, and that has the same property that it's impossible to tell if the $5 someone has is the **same** $5 you claimed to own. (Well you can trace serial numbers etc, but in general there is no way). 
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:48:06
It seems easier to me though now I'm used to it.
I just have to put those details in my wallet program and it's done. Without involving any 3rd party in the transaction. Which is the big plus for me
@_date: 2014-01-31 13:47:56
Some regulation is a good thing.
For example if you pay someone 25BC for a new car and they say haha we're going to keep them and not give you the car, it's in your interest that those bitcoin are considered to have value by the authorities.
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:19:16
You can't. But you can examine the blockchain and look for suspicious blocks. For example high value transactions being the subject of conflicting chains, and if it happens too often draw your own conclusions about those nodes propagating the blocks. It's far from perfect but if the chances of being caught out are non-zero it will discourage people. 
This is why some regulation of bitcoin is a good thing.  It's not like any new law is required for this, it's simply fraud and existing laws should cover it anyway, as long as bitcoin is acknowledged to have some actual value.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:23:20
Seems to me unlikely that he'd accept money, although I hope he does. It's a good idea to let him pick a charity, it might help him think something good has come out of all this. And if not the EFF is good too.
and if he is the "real" satoshi even though I think not, then that's good too, happy to donate to him or his charity.
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:52:58
Close enough to instant in most cases now, yes.
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:41:10
My *opinion* is that this is somewhat a bubble. A lot of people were buying simply in the expectation that the value of their asset would rise, thus causing that to happen...
However it's not *just* a bubble. It's clear that the last few months something has changed and adoption is really taking off and as it does so the price is going to rise and rise considerably.
So I believe that the price will rise, and rise a lot... But it's also likely that it will rise far faster than there is any underlying reason so, and probably crash back a few more times.
So yes, it's a bubble, but there are still good reasons to believe that the future is strong anyway
@_date: 2014-03-08 11:29:57
And that's fine.
If he's able to give it to a charity at least he might be able to think some good has come of all this.
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:19:14
No. There is no proof. 
But there are enough coincidences that it seems well worth keeping a look at what';s going on.
@_date: 2014-02-15 19:15:30
I guess this is why put options were invented in "the real world". I guess bitcoin doesn't have those yet
@_date: 2014-02-15 11:19:49
As bloomberg's primary business is not TV or even news so much, it's distributing price data for often complex financial instruments, often with multiple pricing sources, that they would be well placed to deal with this :)
@_date: 2014-05-31 10:27:06
Pretty much what I do.
Today I bought 0.3BTC and sent 0.2 of them to my long term paper wallet address and the other 0.1 to my live wallet to replace what I'd spent recently.
(The limiting factor on what I spend from my account isn't that I want to save more, it's that there aren't more things I want to buy that accept it yet)
@_date: 2014-01-25 10:24:39
dogecoin needs to just die.
Frankly it's a stupid embarasment to people who want to set up a proper working currency. It makes the whole think look like a joke
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:19:51
Yes. 
But even then it's very hard, if not impossible, to do so without people noticing. And at just 51% of the hash rate it would take a very long time to overtake the rest of the network to replace any transaction that's more than an hour or two old.
it's certainly a real issue, and absolutely needs to be dealt with. But 51% isn't a sudden complete disaster that gives anyone complete control instantly.
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:52:08
For 1BTC though that's the appropriate level of security. If I had 20BTC I'd have better security...
@_date: 2014-02-16 11:53:21
Yes I've ordered from here a few times.
It literally takes seconds from sending the transaction in my wallet to the webpage confirming my order.

Ugh, I have a .333Ghz hash usb thing which was worth running for a while but no longer is. Main problem is that I have 0.02 bitcoin on bitminter but you need 0.1 to pay out and I'll never reach that now, but 0.02 has some value.... Wonder if there is any way to get them to pay me that small amount as it's not worth me mining any more 
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:57:22
Well I don't *need* a free lunch. But I'd happily accept one!
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:50:41
This seems reasonable. I think bitcoin will grow and do well and be useful to a lot of people but probably not change the world.
But aside from that, I bought some bitcoin, but I wouldn't invest more than 1 or 2% of my wealth in it. It's just too risky to do that.  I have literally no idea if it will be worth anything in 5 years. I hope and expect so, but that's all my opinin is worth...
@_date: 2014-03-08 13:50:26
I made a paper wallet and laminated it and stuck it in a fire safe.
In the same way that I'd leave 0.1BTC worth of cash lying around in my house but I wouldn't just leave 1.0BTC worth just there, I treat the bitcoin the same. I'll leave 0.1 in my wallet on my PC but 1.0 is enough to put it somewhere safe.
@_date: 2014-01-01 11:27:27
What reason would anyone have to invest in this rather than just buy bitcoins themselves?
@_date: 2014-01-23 23:03:52
Bankers have no need to be scared of bitcoin.
All the stuff that's profitable to banks... Loans, Investing money, Equities, Bonds, Pension, Financial Advice etc.
All of that is just as necessary even if bitcoin takes over the world. And in fact it's better for the banks as it makes it easier to send them money etc.
@_date: 2014-01-27 17:09:06
If the allegations are true then good. 
Bitcoin has been used for illegal practices and it's all good if that gets cleaned up.
Honestly, the fact that bitcoin was involved here isn't really the story.
@_date: 2014-01-21 10:25:53
It gives people the confidence to use bitcoin as a payment system. Once usage grows the value should stabilize somewhat so people will be more likely to use it as a currency where they keep the coins to spend later. At the moment there are two reasons why they get converted.
1) Nobody is quite sure of the tax and legal position of them, so it's much easier to use a service to accept bitcoin but be paid in £ or $ so all your existing systems work.
2) It's early days and generally companies need $ or £ to pay their bills, not bitcoin. So they have to convert. If companies could pay *their* bill in BT they would be more liekyl to keep them
@_date: 2014-03-28 10:05:07
I agree with this enough to buy. I agree with those claiming it's risky to not invest too much :)
I'll probably buy 1-2 more bitcoin this month. I believe it's a good time to buy but my confidence isn't enough to risk any money that I might need.
@_date: 2014-01-17 15:56:15
Those people who know what they are doing are not going to insure their bitcoins because they understand how to easily ensure they are stolen. So by definition almost, this is aimed at those who don't know how to secure themselves, and so perhaps this accurately reflects the risk?
@_date: 2014-01-09 14:16:56
Right, I agree entirely now.
I assumed that you'd just "rent" a hardware device and configure it to mine to whatever pool you wanted. But it really doesn't seem to work like that.
@_date: 2014-04-14 10:27:14
I was kind of interested in doing this as a spare time project, but as soon as I started to look into it I was put off by the consequences of doing it wrong. Apart from any legal liability issues I would not be happy if some bug in my code lost someones bitcoins... and also there is too much scope for people sending their bitcoins to the wrong address then blaming the app.
I really hope someone does make one though :)
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:03:45
That might well be true now but I very much doubt it will last until you are in your 60s like this person mentioned. I used to do that in my 20s-30s but now I'm in my 40s it just doesn't happen nearly as much. I NEED MY SLEEP! :)

1) It doesn't.
2) Because the author only every used the name Satoshi Nakamoto and was otherwise unidentified right up to the time he vanished 3 years ago.
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:15:40
Of course it can be regulated. And that's a good thing. Committing fraud or theft using bitcoin is still just as illegal as with £ or $ and should be. Giving investment advice "officially" in bitcoin will be regulated. And probably already is under most countries general rules. Sure, things are bit different. And there certainly ought to be a much lighter touch. But the law doesnt just vanish because you hope it will. The regulation isn't and won't be the same as traditional currencies, but regulation there is of some kind.
 An no it's not the whole point. It's some of the point perhaps.
@_date: 2014-01-09 10:45:40
If I were to spend some money on "mining contracts", how much would that cost in order to be able to help even a tiny bit? if someone spent $100 for example would that likely buy 0.1% (unlikely) or 0.000001% of the total hash capacity. I have little idea how much I could help by spending some to make sure the mining was done on smaller pools and how much one would have spend in order to make a detectable (but perhaps not significant) different?  (I realise it would be a lot more than $100 but that's just to get some idea of the amounts..)
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:30:40
I've never donated to wikipedia. The problem is that I'd be willing to donate something like £1-£5 but frankly the hassle of credit cards or distrust of paypal or whatever you can pay with (I don't actually know) has a much higher cost in effort than the financial cost to me. There either has to be a direct benefit to me, or I've *really* got to want to send money in order to bother.
If I could send bitcoin it's so simple to send 0.02 or whatever to an address I'd be 10 times more likely to do so.
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:17:53
And just because they are not regulating it doesn;t mean that ordinary fraud laws don't apply

My (UK) ISP seems to have a card printing service. No sure if it's suitable for one off cards though.  Might make an alternative to a paper wallet... (And they are one of the few companies I find entirely trustworthy)
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:37:09
Where is a good place to buy then? I'd spend some money. Mostly to help support the network. I don't care about making a profit particularly but would like to generate enough BC to cover a good part of the cost of course :P
I see lots of websites, but have no idea who to trust, and scams are common..
@_date: 2014-01-22 15:52:13
They talk in the article about how they want it as a payment system, not a currency. But if it takes off as a payment system it will become a currency anyway. Because why would you convert your BC to £ when you receive them, and then convert them back again to pay someone else. No. You;d just keep some or all of them - currency!

There doesn't seem to be much in my price range anyway. They are all way too much for a year $1000+, or too small, (Renting 0.33Ghash) for not much money. Doesn't seem to be any 3 month mid range ones. Ah well ... :)

In which case there is no gpl related issue at all. If it's not their own code there may be an issue. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 12:24:58
Presumably it would be possible to submit a new transaction spending the same coins but with a fee so that it will get picked up first and the old transaction will be rejected. Is that correct?
There doesn't seem to be any simple way to do this with a common wallet though.
@_date: 2013-12-27 09:14:55
I just read that as arse bitcoin. Which probably gives entirely the wrong idea.
@_date: 2013-12-31 10:29:01
I have less of a problem with this than most of the things that have been revealed because this is most likely a targeted operation. I want the security services to monitor actual threats that they have some actual fears about (with appropriate oversight, which may be missing right now...). Its the indiscriminate surveillance of everyone that is the problem. This does not appear to be that so much.
