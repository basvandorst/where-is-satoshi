I will. Safely too because there's no way LBC has code that can escape VM.

crooked reddit. Talk about the death of freespeech, my comments are instantly removed and this isn't even a controversial topic. They now control what you talk about and what you can contribute to it.

Seems like they removed my posts then allowed them -- [

run in on a virtual machine and you should be safe. So many people saying to stay away from it, that means it's time for me to download it and find out everything about it. Everyone has an agenda these days

Yeah you didn't notice all those right wing subs that make it to the frontpage? LOL. All I see everynight is a minimum of 3 Trump hit pieces on the frontpage consistently, the only time I didn't see any hit pieces in months was the day after Trump fired those missles. Rightwing subs never make it to the frontpage, have you ever seen T_D there? Reddit is shady as fuck, this LBC nonsense reminds me of the gold/silver hit piece Reddit did the day after the FED raised interest rates and the price of precious metals jumped. They're manipulators and you should especially focus on anything that they try to censor.

Your arrogance shows in your comment history, you seem very annoying. Please don't respond to my comments anymore.
