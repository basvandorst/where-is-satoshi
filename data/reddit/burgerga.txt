After reading about the stuff they supposedly do. I always make a point to read the hidden reviews. Many times they do seem like spam. And even if a few don't, they could be hidden for things such as posting from the same IP address as other reviews.

Nope, it actually states that you must sign up for a bit pay account and then add the biopsy api key to your payment hub account.

Apparently BTCBRL=X for Brazilian Real. I tried BTCEU=X but that doesn't work, maybe its something else?
BTCEUR=X should work.

Sure, what it has turned into is great for all crypto currencies. But I agree with at first it seemed like it was just making fun of bitcoin using the latest hot meme. "Your bitcoin is stupid, anything can be a crypto" type of thing.

When you sign a transaction you sign the details of where you got the money from. There is no way to simply spend a million bitcoins if you never had a million in your account and you don't need the blockchain to verify this. The avenue of attack here is a double spend, where you spend the same coin twice. Although to do this is still difficult as you have to make two transactions at almost the same time. Only one transaction will make it to the blockchain and then the other merchant will be screwed. But it's generally not worth it for small retail transactions, and that's why large transactions wait for confirmations. Additionally, I believe you can check the network for double spends before it even gets to the chain, so if set up the right way, a merchant doesn't really need to worry about 0 conf transactions.

Yeah, websites could do it on their own, but I'm betting that with PayPal it's as easy as signing up and clicking a button. You don't have to do the integration on your website.
@_date: 2014-08-07 20:20:59
That seems really complicated...
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:44:50
Yes, that is one way a double spend could be attempted. But, you don't need to have a transaction in the Blockchain in order to check it for a double spends. When you sign a transaction, the network spreads it around until all the nodes have it. This is done before it is ever put into the Blockchain and happens within seconds. This is how a merchant even knows that you sent them the coins in the first place.
It is my understanding that it is trivial to check the network to see if the coins have  already been spent without having to consult the Blockchain. I think I heard about some merchant software coming out that would do this. This means that in order to execute the double spend, have to get transaction 1 to merchant 1 before it gets to merchant 2, and transaction 2 to merchant 2 before merchant 1. This is where it would become easier with direct communication between the merchant and the customer (like NFC), as you guarantee that the very first node that sees your transaction is that merchant.
It is easy however to imagine a system where the point-of-sale system gets a transaction and immediately sends it to a node controlled by a website like Blockchain.info. It could then ask the site if those coins had been spent. If every system did something like this a double spend attack would be impossible as blockchain.info would tell the first merchant the transaction is good, and the second (even milliseconds later) that the coins had been spent.
It is also worth noting that double spend attacks are only really feasible for small transactions making then not really worth the effort, although there have been some successes with dice sites I believe (see edit).
EDIT: What I described is only one kind of double spend attack and due to the speed of the network is already extremely difficult if not practically impossible. The other way is a 51% attack. If you have control of 51% of mining power then you can do things like spend some coins, then if you get the next block you can instead include a different transaction of those coins (say to yourself). This is possible without 51%, you just have to get lucky, but at 51% you're statistically guaranteed that your false transaction will remain in the blockchain.

Wrong, you're off by a factor of 56 due to stock splits. And that's not counting dividends either. But that's beside the point, which is that early investors (that stick to their investment - many people sold Bitcoin/apple stock early when holding it could have made them much more) will always make a ton more than a late investor. That's the gamble of investing. When it's early in the game you're taking a larger risk that your investment will pay off. And when it does you get a bigger reward. It's the same principle as sports betting. A successful bet on the underdog is going to pay out more because it was a bigger risk.
Besides, Bitcoin absolutely does not fit the definition of a Ponzi scheme. Nobody is putting money in under the guise of "investing" only to have it given away to those who came before them. Just because something shares one thing in common with a Ponzi scheme does not actually make it one.

On December 12, 1980, Apple launched its IPO (initial public offering) of its stock, selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share and was open to all. Anyone could make a stake (risk, gamble, what-have-you) in the ~~system~~ company. Now ~~people~~ nobody sneer[s] at the early adopters (investors) who stuck with it for being disproportionately rewarded. ~~Well~~ Because guess what, that's life! That's how every human endeavor that's worth anything works.

@_date: 2013-11-21 17:11:55
But the point is that if you've supposedly lost the key to the wallet, there is no way to move the funds without them noticing, and then you clearly have not lost the key.

Not only has it been running without any kind of crack, but the incentive to find a flaw is huge. If someone could somehow cheat the system to grab a 25 btc reward without actually mining, or in some other way obtain bitcoin through a hack, they could make a TON of money. The fact that none has been found yet is a testament to how strong it is.

You set an interest rate. You can also insure the loan so that if the price drops fast enough that Bitfinex can't sell their backup in time, you don't lose anything.

 A little late but I have some technological  questions. 
So the double spending problem is solved by mining blocks and recording your doesn't coins in the chain. But it will take at least a few minutes until a block with your transaction is mined. So what's to stop you from double spending before the first transaction is mined? I assume that is what confirmations are, correct? Is the first confirmation the point at which it is mined? If so what are the additional confirmations? Are they the network agreeing that they also see the transaction in the block chain?
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:30:43
I had ~1BTC that had been sitting around for a couple years. I hadn't paid much attention to it until this recent price raise. I had the wallet file on my computer and could see the balance but couldn't find the password anywhere. I knew I would have generated it in 1Password but it wasn't in my vault. Then I remembered it was in a different 1Password file in a VM on my laptop. So I try to boot the VM and it kept crashing. I eventually got into the VM and got the key out so heart-attack averted, but I was really worried.
