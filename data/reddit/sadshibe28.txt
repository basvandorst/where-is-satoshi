USD went up if u measure it against computerz, lel!). Now apparently you don't know how governments work either, because you think the government could be pessimistic or irrelevant in its measuring of inflation. And now you try to "win" the argument by going to your fallacies book and trying to find something.


I can't back up that the USD goes down at least 2% every year? That was the icing on the cake, lol.

The blockchain isn't as big as people claim. Yes, it might be used for other types of contracts in the far, far future. But the new type of money the blockchain already created is way more important in my opinion. The people claiming it isn't, is usually the same people who only see Bitcoin as a glorified Paypal. They only see it as a payments network. Bitcoin as a store of value is the most important use the blockchain has, and will have for a long time, and it's not clear that will ever change.

Holy crap, I like that.

When you cancel a chunk you get money back depending on how much time left there was on that month you paid. So it's kind of like cloud. I would be ok with that if I could create and delete chunks programatically.

You can't tell which is more: 272 or 40

And the senator understood it, because he repeated it later after Andreas left.

Ok Bitcoin is doomed.

Sure but IBM doesn't seem to be developing the crypto space, everything they have said point to a centralized system, managed by the same old banksters. They will only use the blockchain as marketing buzzword.

But the butters will take any advice Warren Butter gives publicly.

Because nobody uses dogecoin.

Citation needed.
Personally I only care about Bitcoin as a store of value.

That doesn't make it a cryptographic currency at all.

Except the most important benefit of Bitcoin: fixed supply.
Statecoin is useless, and people will only use it if forced, like every other fiat.

Tips le fedora.

Which is good. Is Ethereum the new coin/project you want to pump? What happened to your Dogecoin?

Does chunkhost have an API we can use for creating the chunks programatically? If not, when will it have it?
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:52:02
Where did I say time guarantees anything?

Don't be scared, just think this: It hasn't even been a year yet. Investments take time to grow.

We also see idiots defending it and saying "that never happened to me! everything is ok!"

I would pay an army of internet trolls to:
- Scare and harass newcomers
- Derail all the discussions, annoy anyone who tries to share ideas, spread negativity and make people leave
- Pose as bitcoin supporters and make them look bad in front of others
- Downvote interesting/important posts and comments, upvote shit or FUD ones
- Make the topic get banned from everywhere, eg: Spam tips to have the tip bots and anyone trying to tip banned.
We have already seen all of the above. But mods here still say there is no such thing as trolls, just people who "disagree". In any other sub, such kinds of trolls would be banned instantly. And if they create a new account, they would get banned again, simple as that.
