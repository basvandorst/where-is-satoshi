I am getting the same. I run bitcoind-status to monitor my nodes as well and they are reporting the bitcoind daemon is fine. I think its something on bitnodes end.
Maybe related to the recent meltdown/spectre CPU bug and they are patching there systems that monitor nodes causing downtime but looks like nodes are down.

The balls to login without a VPN and the fact this person is in the same city as me as well. Clearly doesn't care about covering tracks, but with crypto there's not really anything you can do in situations like this.
Sorry for your loss.

I do wonder if they'll catch on and implement a minimum deposit amount when the deposit source is a Coinbase wallet.

1st January 2018 is the date for when Coinbase users can withdraw their BCH.

Plot twist. Bitcoin "crashed" because of the lack of dank memes.

KEEP HODLING ON.

I wouldn't mention testicles around here. Someone lost one of theirs based on a bet with the internet about the price of BTC. Welcome to @_date: 2017-12-19 20:45:02
Certainly better from a security perspective of preventing withdrawals in the event of an account breach, but hardware or paper wallets will always be the preferred option.

Its a real service. It was formerly known as 21.co, the parent site of bitnodes.21.co before they rebranded.

1st January 2018 the great BCH sell off. Wonder if Coinbase will be able to handle the mass withdrawal traffic?!

This the real early adopter right here.
