Deflation could be better explained by the bitcoin community. Deflation can be devastating to anyone that has debt that is measured in a deflationary currency. Imagine if you took out a car loan in bitcoin when bitcoin was priced at $100 and bought the equivalent of a $30,000 car with it. Today that loan would be 6 times more difficult to pay off ($180,000). Deflation is devastating to the dollar because both the government and consumers are carrying large amounts of debt, in fact the dollar is backed by this debt (without debt, the dollar can't exist). But bitcoin is an actual asset, it isn't created through debt and it's users don't typically take bitcoin loans. Therefore, any deflation in bitcoin can only be good for it's economy.

You're talking about a similar situation as to what's happening in the commodities markets right now, where there's more paper good and silver that physical gold and silver to back up the paper. It's not sustainable. All this does is hold the price of those commodities down until it's eventually gets out of control and the whole system implodes. Then, the value of the physical gold and silver will immediately skyrocket.

While it could technically someday be valued at millions per coin, I think at that point the dollar would be nearly worthless in purchasing power.
I speculate the max purchasing power a single coin could experience, as a number we'd currently would be familiar with, would be about $400,000/coin. That's based off of an estimated $9 trillion world money supply (in circulation; estimates vary considerably) and would require bitcoin be THE world currency.

The average "conservative" believes the national budget should be balanced and the debt paid down. The disconnect is that, if the debt is paid down, the dollar would be destroyed. The dollar is created through the sale of treasury bonds, which is out debt... If the bonds were paid back without new ones being issued, all the dollars would vanish and the whole economy would lock up.

There's an old principle of economics... "Good money flushes out bad money." This means that if someone is in possession of both a good money (something that maintains or appreciate in value) and bad money (something that loses value), and they go to purchase something, they'll give up the bad money before giving up the good money.
I want to support the bitcoin economy and retailers that accept it... What I'll do to do this is spend it wherever I can on purchases that I would make regardless, and then immediately buy back what I had spent (or typically slightly more) on Coinbase.
