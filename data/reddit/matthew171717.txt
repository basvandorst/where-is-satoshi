true , but im very optimistic on crypto... i do believe it's going to change the world , and i can afford to invest that amount.  What i don't do is invest more than i can afford.

True , most people view it simply as an asset.  I've used it as both.

Was very proud of myself ! Trying to get my sister on board , supposed to see her tn!

True ! Very unlikely but i would love to see growth like that :) I feel that bitcoin is undervalued as an asset , possibly because a majority of the population doesn't understand it. If a recession happens , we could see interest in BTC rise and adoption rate increase , which would lead to price growth.

Exactly! I actually was telling a friend about it yesterday , he thought he was required to buy a full bitcoin at a time. I showed him how it's divisible and he ended up making his first investment into bitcoin !
