Don't believe the FUD. The score will be at least 10,000 to 0.

Thank you for posting this.  I've been contemplating using for the past few weeks, but have been putting it off.  I'd like to hear them comment on this before automating my deposits.

That is not true.  The Litecoin dev asked doge to merge mine with them.

BCI is a company.  It is centralized.  It is not a crypto currency or a decentralized protocol.  It sounds like the only thing that will satisfy you is Bitcoin Core, which there is no problem with.  I am looking for something a little lighter, and still more secure.
So more to the point, can you tell me how it matters in any way what OPSEC blockchain.info or MyWallet has in regards to signing offline transactions?
They are just a mule for public information in this particular application.

I use blockchain.info every day and it is a valuable service for small amounts of money.  Last time I checked they fixed this problem.  The rest of your trolling can be backed up by facts if you want me to consider them for a response.  One look at their about page discredits your first sentence.

They have more than one developer.  I can understand how your lack of research has brought you to make your mistake.

What makes you say that?

To be clear, though, my workflow is not affected when analyzed with your level of scrutiny, right?  Armory will sign the transactions.
@_date: 2015-03-22 17:37:55
Thanks!  This works.

Yep, all signing is done offline.  I was trying to avoid having to run an online instance of Armory and that is really all.  I use blockchain.info for pocket change but I have some offline addresses listed there as watch only.  It still would be really cool if could generate the unsigned transactions right there until the point it needs to be signed, at which point it provided you the unsigned hex string for offline signing.

After inputting my public addresses and downloading the data from the blockchain, there was no way to advance in the dialog besides signing the transaction.  Armory will do the signing.

Can you list any issues with the wallet that **have not** been fixed?

Hmm, my objective is to get the built yet unsigned transaction in text format.  I would then be taking the unsigned transaction on a usb over to my offline Armory instance in my underground bunker where I will sign the transaction in Armory.  After returning home, and verifying that I wasn't followed, I would broadcast the signed transaction to the blockchain on blockchain.info.  With this cool brainwallet tool, I would need to input my private keys manually which would eliminate the need for Armory to manage my keys.  I also would not be able to build the transaction unless I was already in my underground bunker with access to the keys AND I had a hot internet connection!
