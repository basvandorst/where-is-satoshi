Let me guess: you're invested in ETH?
/me checks RexetBell's post history, oh well what do you know! You ARE invested in ETH. **What an utterly unexpected coincidence**.
Bitcoin Core fans: you will rue the day that you fucked over embedded consensus systems, Counterparty has had Bitcoin's back all along. THIS is what happens when you let the inmates at *Blockstream* run the asylum.

I've been in BTC since 2012. There's always been this bizarre contingent of people who are against all mainnet innovation having to do with OP_RETURN, such as [Counterparty]( Their reasons for having such an anti-mainnet innovation view essentially boil down to a selfish desire to run full nodes on elite Gentoo home desktop computers.
These Gentoo-ism having people are in complete control of Bitcoin Core, and conveniently do things such as found companies like Blockstream, and wail and wail about how Bitcoin can never scale because then nobody who uses Gentoo desktop can run a node at home. This has NEVER been why Bitcoin has had market value.
For over three years now, those of us invested in Counterparty have had to hear endless complaints about our innovative activities, only to be told that what we are doing has no value, that we're parasites "spamming" the Bitcoin blockchain. Meanwhile, ETH has managed to hit 20% of Bitcoin's market cap and Blockstream was founded to do the very same things Counterparty does on mainnet.
The Bitcoin Core COIs and their related bizarre anti-consumer, anti-innovation stances, are what is killing Bitcoin. They claim Bitcoin can be a digital gold, but you can't be gold if people aren't willing to invest in your asset; and very few people are willing to invest in pure ponzi schemes: "Oh I'm buying because other people are buying and the price is going up and Greg Maxwell is such a great cyph3rpunk". That has never been why Bitcoin has had value, and you know what? Now reality is hitting them right in the fucking face, exactly as many predicted.
The solution is to drop Bitcoin Core and fork to [libbitcoin](
Libbitcoin is lead by Eric Voskuil, a naval aviator and ZeroMQ core contributor with deep knowledge of the Bitcoin P2P protocol. Importantly, libbitcoin syncs from the genesis block to present in *under an hour* including full address indexing and stealth address support.
This super fast address indexing allows [Counterparty]( which implements the complete Ethereum VM, to thrive. Meanwhile the stealth addresses obviate the need for most privacy coins.
This also has the advantage of removnig Greg Maxwell's toxic influence over the Bitcoin project, as he will be at best expert counsel to libbitcoin instead of having absurd amounts of control over the project.
Then, bigger blocks, OP_RETURN, and we can do SPECTRE for 12s block times. At this point, Bitcoin would provide everything Ethereum does natively in a much safer and more immutable form factor.

This is the most disappointing thing I've ever seen from Andreas.
I wonder if he's aware of what Greg Maxwell thinks of him, and is just egging on the crippling of Bitcoin because he has his golden parachute.
I've replied to the people replying to me, but I'm being actively censored. Just visit to see the rest of my responses to these ETH shills.

Every proof of work coin is mined by pretty much the same miners. Marco Krohn, John McAfee, Jihan Wu, all the usual suspects in Bitcoin have branched out into altcoin mining and GPU mining. It turns out the same Chinese warehouses can be filled with GPUs, whooda thunk it?!
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:11:43
That's not a solution either: you can put CPUs or GPUs in a Chinese warehouse. The result is the same.
Now, the [btcsuite]( devs have created an actual working fix to PoW mining centralization: it's a [hybridized PoW/PoS system]( where investors in the coin vote after each block on whether the PoW miners should get rewarded in BTC.
Such a hybridized system gives ordinary users a kill switch for miners, e.g. it would allow Bitcoin USERS to vote to strip Jihan Wu of all mining rewards starting today. No GPUs or CPUs or ASICs needed.

Then you've surely read the whitepaper "[Decentralized Prediction Market without Arbiters]( by Iddo Bentov, Alex Mizrahi and Meni Rosenfeld where a powerful framework is presented for soft forking a BTC-denominated prediction market on top of Bitcoin mainnet without forcing the network to integrate a VM (or any altcoins).


Let me guess, you're invested in ETH?
And let me add to that: you know how billions of people use Facebook but almost nobody knows (or cares) what Facebook's technology stack is?
Bitcoin works like that too: **No one gives a shit about who can run full nodes on home desktop computers**. This has never been why Bitcoin has had value, and if you're willing to cripple Bitcoin mainnet despite knowing this is true, you are extremely likely to have a conflict of interest.

Stephen Pair has been coding since he was six years old. He personally wrote the software stack powering BitPay and he's been following cryptographic money since before Digicash.
IMHO, of any Bitcoin company, BitPay has the strongest repetoire of open source software. It's because an organization reflects its leadership.
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:32:34
[According to Dave Collins of btcsuite]( who is also lead developer of a [hybridized PoW/PoS system]( 51% attacks are less severe in hybridized consensus systems since investors in the coin vote after each block on A) whether the block is considered valid and B) whether to reward the PoW miner with BTC:


This not only protects against active attackers, it gives users a kill switch on PoW miners, so some of us could for instance vote to strip Jihan Wu of the mining reward starting today.

Blocks can be full of a low volume of high-fee paying transactions, or full of a high volume of low-fee paying transactions.
And Greg Maxwell believes very low transaction fees have "[unbounded demand](


Which would imply he's more confident in bigger block throughput than smaller block throughput.

If XCP depends on the Bitcoin network to function, how will XCP overgrow BTC? That's like saying Gnosis or Augur will overgrow ETH. And even if that were somehow true, it's the kind of thing that ensures the platform stays relevant by adding popularly coveted innovations.
ETH is hitting 50% of Bitcoin's market cap as we speak. At what point are you going to admit that embedded consensus systems are NOT "blockchain bloat" or "spam"? Note that Counterparty has had the full Ethereum VM running on top of Bitcoin [since 2014]( You're telling us that isn't valuable? You're telling us you'd rather have Ethereum operating as a completely separate chain which is now in position to kill Bitcoin completely? Is there really no better way?
Please, if you don't like Counterparty, then just make a competing embedded consensus system that you consider superior. I'm sure you'd do an awesome job at it. Bitcoin [desperately needs]( this type of innovation.

You're wrong. Hash power deployed by large scale Bitcoin investors is the ONLY sybil-proof consensus mechanism we have for measuring Bitcoin investor sentiment. If you want your "grassroots" efforts to be taken seriously, at least participate on 


This is insanity, and I think you're well aware of that. SW+2MB is a perfectly reasonable first step on the path to putting Bitcoin back on track.


No, you.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:14:53
If you believe the majority of Bitcoin hash power is acting maliciously, then Bitcoin is broken. The Bitcoin system assumes an *honest hash power majority*:




- Satoshi Nakamoto
And there's no reason to believe SW+2MB as advocated for by *Barry Silbert* is in any way malicious. The guy has done more good for Bitcoin, and invested more money into making Bitcoin mainstream than anyone else on the planet.

- 90% of coins are owned by 1% or less of the investors in the space, this statistic cuts across all digital currencies
- most of those investors were already wealthy prior to investing
- gap between rich/poor will widen catastrophically if digital currency catches on hugely
Then consider that Bitcoin has no other sybil-proof consensus mechanism but PoW mining to guage investor sentiment. And since there's so much general noise in this industry, those miners form their decisions partly based on what Silicon Valley Elite says.
If you have no hydro power, or if you aren't an elite VC, you have zero sovereignty in the Bitcoin system.
Now, there are some digital currencies which seek to rectify Bitcoin's governance issues with a hybridized PoW/PoS system, but that doesn't rectify the wealth divide, nor is it immune to plutocratic tendencies.
If you don't like what you see going on in Bitcoin, too bad: there's no escaping it. Digital currency has severe downsides. But the system *is* working as intended by Satoshi Nakamoto, the currency is fixed supply and global, and can support the rise of an all new financial system built on cryptography and open APIs. Ultimately, SW+2MB is a low risk change that everyone can support.

Securities regs are there because people who raise a shitton of money from other people tend to exit scam or misappropriate the money. You'd think Bitcoiners would appreciate this fact. I also didn't say SROs couldn't work, although it's interesting to note that existing ICO ratings agencies refuse to rate ETH as an ICO, probably because they're invested in ETH. The ratings agencies are invested in the shares they're supposed to be objectively rating, but are refusing to rate ETH as an ICO out of a sense of *protectionism*.

Bitcoin is a plutocracy, and has been one for years.
Just wait til it dawns on you that 90% of all digital currency is controlled by 1% or less of the investors in this space.

If we count all the ASIC manufacturers that have ever sold rigs to the public, you can add Butterfly Labs, KNC and Spoondoolies to this list.
What's so hard to believe? ASICs are easier to manufacture than GPUs. You can go from concept to mass production in 12 months or less. Take *Butterfly Labs* for example. *Literal scammers* that cost people a lot of money sure enough got ASICs produced within this timeframe in 2012-2013.
Consider what it would take to make a GPU competitive with AMD/Nvidia's offerings. Is GPU mining really so much more decentralized than ASIC mining? Answer: NO.

Please, allow me:


You can stop right there with the assumptions. Bitcoin's nearest competitor has taken **50% of its market cap**. Average fees, for tiny, simple transactions are over $1, with many transactions never clearing the perpetual backlog that *your company*, Blockstream, has strenuously advocated for. Investors are SICK and TIRED of the stagnation and refusal to scale.


What mechanisms does the Bitcoin protocol *use* to guage investor sentiment? Straw polls? Reddit threads? Twitter battles? To the extent Bitcoin has any governance model at all, it's devolved into a *plutocracy*, because economic power is the only thing we can go by.


Without any method of actively polling investors on the blockchain in a sybil proof format, the biggest "users" of Bitcoin ARE none other than the biggest Bitcoin companies.


You're being dramatic. 2MB blocks are nothing to be afraid of.


ETH is hitting 50% of Bitcoin's market cap. Fees are over $1.00, transactions are not confirming. The Bitcoin system is teetering on the edge of destruction. Please do the right thing and swallow your pride for once.
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:52:52
Do you really think if *Gnosis* somehow outpumps ETH, that's a bad thing for Ethereum? Technically nothing is stopping Gnosis holders from paying Ethereum miners in GNO, just like, *technically*, nothing is stopping XCP holders from paying Bitcoin miners in XCP. But regardless, if such an event occurred, it's the tradeoff the respective network makes to retain *popularly coveted innovations*. Right now, Bitcoin lacks Ethereum support and because of this it's bleeding marketshare to Ethereum.
Counterparty is Bitcoin's answer to this.


In the far fetched case where XCP becomes more valuable than BTC, it will come off the back of Ethereum, which right now is at 50% of Bitcoin's market cap. Again, please create a superior embedded consensus system, because it's desperately needed *today*.


You see all those ICOs on Ethereum? They're like stock, and there will be futures and options markets for those shares; there will be prediction markets; and when built on Counterparty and Bitcoin all of those transactions will *necessarily* compensate Bitcoin miners, with BTC miner fees being the path of least resistance.
