I can transfer money around quickly and efficiently:
**5:00 PM - 5:05 PM**
Want to trade around some altcoins. I buy some coins at an exchange.
**5:05 PM - 6:00 PM**
Want to play some poker with those coins now. Send it instantly and directly from exchange to pokersite and play till 6 PM.
**6:00 PM**
Made some profits, now I want to buy some goodies with it. Send some from the pokersite to an online webshop, and to a pizza site, to order myself some pizza
**6:01 PM**
Coins arrived at webshop, AND pizza shop.
**6:10 PM**
Found myself a nice new hardcover'ed book, it's already shipping.
**6:15 PM**
Found myself a tasty pizza, will be delivered at 6:45 PM
**6:45 PM**
Eating some pizza and thinking about all the stuff I have done in the past 2 hours, at almost no transaction costs. Oh, and the best part? I didn't even have to use my own wallet.dat at all !! 
Imagine I'd first have to transfer everything to PayPal, and then again to the webshop, or pizza shop. Don't forget to pay the fees if applicable.
Or worse, imagine I'd have to send everything to PayPal for the webshop, but the pizza shop only accepts Skrill. Oh and the poker site, that only accepts wired transfers that take 3 days. So that would mean, it will take 5 days to get my money from the pokersite to the pizza site.
**Life is good with Bitcoin.** 
Instant everything, at no cost. And I can send money from site A to site B, without ever having to go through my own wallet or any other online bank account.
People rarely mention this huge advantage, of Bitcoin, over any other payment method, but this is really why I personally love Bitcoin the most.
