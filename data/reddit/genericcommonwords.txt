My parents will never even grasp the basics of bitcoin, but I expect my newborn niece to get it like she would an ipad. i.e. bitcoin is not for this middle-aged englishman. It's probably not even for humans. So as much as this guy does have an interesting discussion of current merits, it misses the big picture as much as an 8 baud modem user would be hard-pressed to see the value of the internet...it's just worlds apart from the true long-term potential.

UDP ring a bell? 
At this point, I don't think you can say that there is more competition for BTC than there is for TCP/IP. There are a lot of marginal alternatives to TCP/IP just like there are a lot of marginal digital currencies as well, but cumulatively, they don't come to 1% of bitcoin's value so they don't really count.

Further, the authors only *assumes* that decentralization is the primary requirement. But is it? And exactly how does one define 'decentralized'? (this is not done)
As one argument has stated, a larger block may actually increase decentralization as it would favour non-Chinese miners and increase geographic distribution. Thus the 'prime goal' is achieved by block increases and also increases throughput. By the author's own argument, this is the most optimal way to resolve the impasse. 
Is decentralization a *central* tenant of BTC, absolutely, but I don't believe it is the *primary* tenant. Non-alterable would be equal to decentralized, imho, and yet we are charging ahead with RBF for almost no reason other than the assumed near-term fee market artificial bottleneck.
To me, while the piece is overall rational, it is stilted in assuming the conclusion in its premise and being very narrowly focused in order to exclude factors that don't fit narrow channel of thought they seem comfortable with while ignoring larger questions and more nuanced circumstances. 
IMHO, not convincing to redeem the faith that has been lost over the last year.
As a side note, if we are talking nodes, if i have the capacity to run a ~70GB full node and the associated bandwidth (which I do), it's not like I will quit and give up because it suddenly becomes ~128GB (a 5% of HD to 10% of HD is not going to put me out of buiness). If you have the means to mine or host a node *today* you have the means to mind or host a node in a bigger block universe, given the technology landscape it is almost trivial (unless you maybe live behind the Iron Internet curtain, but then you are just reinforcing the *centralized* situation we have today). The idea that decentralization at ~64gb must remain at all costs when it was an accidental kludge a few years ago is such blinkered thinking as to be nonsense. We've just gone too far down this rabbit hole to have the author's word made a significant difference.

kamchii gave a good reply. My biased answers is 'yes', but it will depend on what you think BTC will be worth in 6 mos or 6 years depending on your time horizon and risk tolerance.
Personally, I will be accumulating as much as I am able while BTC is &lt;$1,000 CAD. This represents disposable income and &lt;10% of my total net worth (i'm not spending grocery money to gamble on BTC).
If i were young, like 18 - 24, I would be trying to put every spare cent into BTC because your risk tolerance can be much higher and the rewards are huge if BTC is successful (and then shift to diversify at 25 into btc and 'traditional' investments (which are currently plummeting)).

If you would like to explore this concept further, I cannot recommend enough: [Debt: The First 5,000 Years]( which exposes the *social* origin of money.
It's really fantastic.
tl;dr of the book: all money is debt money (including bitcoin) because humans are social animals and sufficiently sophisticated social relations require tokens to track a ledger of favors to one another which eventually grows into large abstract systems. All that 'backs' any form of currency is the ongoing social agreement to accept it.

Like how we have ~90% of the hashrate running on mountains of special purpose hardware (aka ASICs) *in China*?
Here's a scenario the 'decentralization' crowd never seems to appreciate -- the Chinese government sees a threat/value in bitcoin, it decides to nationalize (seize) all bitcoin industry in their country. 51% attack succeeded without spending a dime and done overnight. This doesn't even account for the very close ties that exist between almost all private companies and the central party in China to begin with.
We have a *major* centralization problem today and increasing bandwidth requirements (e.g. blocksize) would go great lengths to *geographically* decentralize the network.
IMHO, a core tenant of bitcoin strategy would be to have no more than 50% of network hashrate in anyone political jurisdiction, but no one seems to think about this.

Computer infrastructure and grid power generation, even the polluting ones, are so vastly more efficient than gold production as to be not even remotely comparable. As of 2008, coals is only 40% of global energy production, and probably less now. So 'primarily' is not exactly correct (particularly since smart miners move close to hydro dams).
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:17:15
Gold is also a liability because of all the human and environmental harm and suffering involved in its extraction. Gold mining is one of the most polluting and destructive activities.

it's creating the ecosystem (or the plumbing) that The One Computer / Internet of Things will exists on.
An easily relatable use case would be that you wanted to professionally enhance a large photo you took with your 50 megapixel phone camera but your handset purposely doesn't have the hardware to efficiently perform that operation. So you click the 'AI Magic Enhance' button and it shoots the image to the cloud and some algorithm does like 10,000 permutations of the large image file and returns the optimally retouched version to you in a few milliseconds. 
That time you borrowed from the cloud - possibly parceled out to millions of other devices - was paid for with dust you had on your phone collectively mined by the 21inc chip. The smart contract to run the retouching operation and allocate the collective resources to do the processing was managed via the 21inc chip. 
You as the user are completely oblivious, all you did was push a button and a perfect picture was returned but you accessed a non-zero percentage of global compute power in a dead-simple user experience.
This is the next level shit we can start to implement when everything has access to the blockchain.
