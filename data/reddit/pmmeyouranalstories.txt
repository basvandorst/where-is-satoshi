@_date: 2018-01-08 16:59:15
Yeah, can't count anymore how often I heard China will do XYZ to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:04:40
Always buy 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:59:29
So? To the moon got say? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:02:57
Some bitcoin?
Jesus, didn't know dogs were that expensive! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:46:54
20k on new year or go home! 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:27:43
Seems like the market responsed with a nose dive.
Sometimes I'm really impressed how often it is :buy the rumor, sell the news... 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:40:48
And then we celebrate every step closer to the old system and wall street.
You peeps are funny. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:16:33
I know people who want to put in a bit of money into bitcoin.
But even if they put in 0,01% of there wealth into it. Bitcoin would explode.
So, they can't. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:46:56
Yeah, have the same (none?) feelings like you.
I sold all my bch and btc. This another story though. But I all in alts. I have pretty big portfolio. It feels by 30%? Yawn... It raises by 13% yawn...
It's crazy how much I don't care any more.. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:29:47
Wouldn't that be illegal?
Oh wait
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:08:10
No one cares around me.
They just think I'm rich now lol
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:52:07
A heart attack every few minutes lmao 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:35:33
Bitcoin doesn't need to be better.
Just be there. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:24:50
Maybe 25k on gdax? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:41:14
True that. Next month could be 25k
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:47:40
And a car costs one million dollar lol
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:26:18
To the moon! 
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:04:56
I think the Bubble will pop in four to six month. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:32:53
Lol never
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:48:55
100 million in bitcoin is nothing
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:05:37
Hodl to the moon! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:51:59
Several agents on one ticket? Plus lead?
Wtf is wrong with this transfer?
Did came from Iran? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:45:05
And there is no tool for that... It might get lost when I try lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:48:45
Just hodl! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:01:12
Which incentive do they have to do any thing?
Price still raises like crazy.
Only thing happening (no matter what they do) is slower or even reduced price per coin.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:25:32
No need to. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:33:06
AND ONLY around 40% are able to use that! Further reducing the amount in circulation!
This is amazing! 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:21:22
Exactly, they will adopt bitcoin via lightning 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:29:16
Or tether. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:19:41
To the moon! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:52:18
Call it BitCar :p
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:47:33
What about
Big the cid?
BTC :) 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:58:41
What did he do? I'm not following. Did he sold his bch instead? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:24:35
So what?
That's why people invest in green energy or in coins without energy waste. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:25:39
We go to the black hole in the center of the galaxy.
Until all alts are sucked into bitcoin, even Dollar. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:41:09
This is good for bitcoin! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:35:05
For trading Romania might be nice tax haven. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:53:42
When I see some posts, I would say that fanatism is already there.
Just need to do it official. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:30:49
I think 16k is the new floor now. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:24:12
And more greed lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:09:56
They could be the coinbase of germany or even Europe!
Quote : Wir werden im nächsten Jahr einen Bitcoinhandel in die App integrieren, ein genaues Datum dafür steht noch nicht fest.“
Translation : we want to integrate bitcoin trading in out app in the next year. An exact is not set yet.
Tendence : buy and hodl
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:57:19
Maybe we should start to calling calling calling it? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:32:41
500k,or go home! 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:48:53
Buy buy buy! 
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:04:09
Stop with your agenda ava shilling. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:50:08
20k end of year!
Buy and hodl boys! 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:25:53
Even if only in average everyone buys only for hundred dollar we are talking about hundreds of thousands per coin! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:06:24
And I say : incentive is the price.
Price raises, even faster and more than ever before.
By which logic would you want to change something?
That, maybe, someday, some people, might or could find out that fees are high? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:27:49
Yeah, a guy I know made a troublesome comment yesterday...
Never told them how much I own.
I told them yeaaarrss ago that they should buy bitcoin.
They never did. After a year or so I stopped talking about it.
So I didn't talk about for, four years or so?
Then yesterday I told them that I locked most of my coins away for my kids.
And use them to day trade.
Now I'm thinking about to lock them all away so not even I can reach them anymore.
But how? :/
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:48:07
Nah, no crash. Just buy and hodl! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:26:01
This guy hodls 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:05:31
Well, we memed a president, why no meme a global currency? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:10:40
20k at the end of year baby!
We gonna be rich boys! 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:06:21
They buy and hodl.
They will never notice high fees or long transaction time. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:39:48
I need high quality!
I'm pretty anal about that! 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:47:27
This will take months
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:28:49
Me too. Making some nice money on alts. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:05:05
So, to the moon? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:55:10
To the moon! 
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:07:46
Yeah, they are not going to buy 1000 btc in minute on the market.
That would be really stupid 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:21:35
Hail hodl! 
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:22:48
Holly shit yes...
That's not good. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:33:24
And those 100 People wouldn't be concerned about tether at all?
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:31:30
Did they even upgrade? I would withdraw ether or something else. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:23:51
Well, I had several thousend there.
Imagine how screwed bot traders are. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:05:06
This might be another mt gox. :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:42:52
The bigger question is : how long will the pump be? Three days? A week? Maybe the pump takes a week and it needs a month before the bubble bursts.
Maybe the pump just got it to the "real perceived value" vs it never pops.
Who knows?
Markets can be long irrational than you have money. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:03:25
Buy buy buy! No matter the price!
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:24:32
Usually the error vanished after a few tries.
Now, nothing works. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:30:40
Which app is it? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:43:52
This guy shits
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:23:12
Papa need some new shoes! 
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:30:23
This! Definitely!
There are some with really unique techniques or uhm government connections :)
Like iota, lisk or Walton 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:30:43
It goes to the moon anyway! 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:01:18
I think he is selling his bch.
Just a gut feeling though. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:35:52
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:23:35
Moon! 
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:39:14
Yes, for two weeks! Woho! 
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:04:09
To the moon! 
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:19:34
The problem is that 2 million in 2030 are not worth much anymore lol
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:44:55
In the financial world, change is slow. Like reeeeaallllyyyy slow. 
A change might break something!
Not good!
I woulndt be surprised that Bitcoin core is at 2 MB in 20 years because changing to 3 or 4MB might break something.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:49:56
We are screwed now.
Deposit and Withdraw are locked now.
MtGox started the same way....
Bloody hell...
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:02:42
Slack. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:28:30
Lol 10k, 16k
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:47:51
Who cares?
Wasting energy to make money or profits is normal 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:35:24
It is dead Jim lol
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:19:26
Wouldn't that new algorithm make it more energy efficient? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:43:18
Bitcoin does not care. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:08:02
I'm looking more from the point of faster difficulty adjustment.
It will have quicker adjustments to have one block around ten minutes.
No matter what.
Which means: excessive hash power (which is over the minimum needed will switch somewhere else. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:12:48
THIS IS NOT A BUBBLE! BUY BUY BUY BUY!!!!
@_date: 2017-10-11 05:04:33
Mined with GPU in a time where you could get like 0,5 of a Bitcoin in a pool per day or so. 
Mined a few weeks, got bored. HD broke, tossed HD way. Because, who cared? 
Yeah, know that feeling :)
@_date: 2017-10-11 08:41:48
I had something like 20 Bitcoins. Not rich by any means. But still enough to get a house and live rent free :)
