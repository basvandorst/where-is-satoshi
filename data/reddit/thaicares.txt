Awesome but I was thinking more along the line of work van not minivan... is there any projects started on that? And I've been meaning to email y'all so glad y'all decided to do something on Reddit! Oh BTW accepting bitcoins was probably a good business/marketing move that is how I first heard of y'all!

are you saying that we should reach an equilibrium soonish that would allow average users to mine bitcoin without loosing money? If so then maybe it ain't so bad my only problem personally is that it is getting to a point were people who have put money into it are gonna loose out and your gonna need crazy special things just to be half way competitive!

Sorry man it worked for me so I don't know whats wrong....

I hear the it would make it a panhandling stuff but if it is just off in the flair I think it would cut down on any of the begging and make transactions really nice and open! I LOVE THE IDEA ;]

I hear a lot about how mining is becoming hard and will soon become useless to mine for those who have invested into there setups... does anyone see this as a horrible downfall of bitcoin? I mean I understand the purpose of it but maybe it shouldn't have been set on a exponential decay. Maybe it plays in to some of the security of the bitcoin I just find it a little unsettling. That might be simply because for me the biggest beauty of bitcoin is anyone can make it!

Just another thing that gives it value because it is a hot word!

I'm very interested in this project and ANY similar projects! I would love to live in a world where I could get all my software, hardware, everything! Open! So this is just amazing as it reminds me of the open ecology project and also an artist (who is also trying to get funding on indiegogo) who will try to live a year as close to the fsf's definition of freedom...  Anyhow I would just love to know how I could help in central Florida as a young adult? Keep in mind I'm currently much more interested in the vehicle designs than your other projects and would love to see a nice van design!

I'm unaware of the legitimacy but it appears other comments question there ability to deliver on their promise. Just always do your homework on stuff like this!

Does everyone here have 200k to be investing in btc or what? Like I'm just confused at this huge amount I haven't even made that much money in my life.... This would be soooo crazy to me! This is a lot of damn money!

I've had an alternative currency idea in which the currency is art made by whoever wants to make it. The value is decided by the person accepting the bill. I'm not sure what I would be willing to give up for your amazing bill, I might have to resist because Stallman can piss me off sometimes! He is good at that I guess though... you know pissing people off.

Probably a better step! I don't know much about the technical side of Bitphone but it seams that networking with a few already existing meshnet protocols and systems would be much easier. I also have read the proof-of-work would be bad for battery were meshnet shouldn't take up any more than the current network system if any...

I'm not actually talking about a cryptocurrency or ELECTRONIC... at all. Anyhow this post led me to do some research on my idea and I found some interesting stuff. Check out 'Boggs bills' and this guy has a similar idea here

I had a similar expierience with an online wallet but had only gotten coin from a few faucets... broke in a long time ago (should check again) and was sooo excited to see pennies and dimes worth of coin in there :D lol ok maybe it was very very different but we both forgot a password?

There should be a service for this, I would really be behind getting RepublicWireless accepting it but I can't stand that they are CDMA... Maybe I should look into changing that first :D
