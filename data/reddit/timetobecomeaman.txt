Imagine looks detailed to someone unaware of the bigger picture. If you can't notice these things it sounds like it's from a crystal ball. It's really not. Just observation of something complex. No detail, just themes of what's driving things and who are getting on board. Most bullish time for Bitcoin actually in a non price sense. The price will follow.

Moving buy orders to $25 is a move which has an effect of increasing demand as you are now willing to pay more per Bitcoin than before.

No believe it to be authentic. Cant sayI am impressed with their withdrawal process though. Requested a 1btc withdrawal (seems to be maximum?) over 5 hours ago and not even verified their side.. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 12:54:44
Thanks for confirming this.

When will this market be settled?
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:43:53
How long do withdrawals take and why the 1btc limit? I had 0.5 on no :)
@_date: 2017-03-10 10:18:28
It says the market closes at 23.59 today. Surely if there is an announcement before then people can bet on a known result  bringing odds right down. Believe this is a mistake unless market auto closes when descision comes out. For what it's worth that 0.5 on no was me.

How do I buy some of this Russia Miner Coin!?!?
This is really big news. As well as more attention and money coming into the crypto space, taking some power away from the Chinese miners is no bad thing.

Are you aware that the BTC dominance % has decreased over the last 4 months? Do you understand what this means? I have an Economics degree but you really don't need one to understanding what that means when looking at holding alts and BTC vs just holding BTC
@_date: 2017-04-24 17:54:42
Agree with OP if you want, whatever you want to say about me. Techie turned trader/analyst doesn't always work as the post suggest. Just doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2017-04-24 19:15:36
I agree with buy and hold. Just think you should include some alts in your portfolio with a ratio matched to the BTC dominance % I think it's a mistake to ignore things like Etheteum are happening. Strongly believe the total crypto market cap will exceed 100 billion but couldn't say for sure bitcoin will stay at least 66.7%. Rather include other coins to hedge and cover any overall bitcoin dominance decrease. Can't if ignore alts.

Thanks for this, I do appreciate it. However trust me when I say I have tried everything to get the ledger working. It has worked fine for the last coupleof months but today it wont recognise it. Nothing has happened to the Ledger itself i.e physical damage.
Have ordered a ledger nano S as have some Ether to store. Just so glad the future incoming transactions can be accessed by the 24 word seed but get your point that this has now been compromised by being input into android phone.
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-04-30 17:11:35
The 24 word seed is what I backed up when i bought the Ledger Nano. The recieving address often changed as seems to be the way these days. The Nano is dead but I got the currecnt BTC from the 24 word seed. 
So you are saying any further bitcoin sent to addresses previously generated by the Ledger can be retrieved using the 24 words again once they arrive?
I think that's what you are saying but just want to make sure. 
Thanks for replying. 
@_date: 2017-04-24 16:14:01
Your maths is wrong. Market cap is price times amount. If price is 10billion dollars per coin and you buy one dollars worth or 0.000000001 worth or whatever that would be then market cap is 10 billion times that number above which would be 1 dollar. Bitcoin at 19 billion odd is 1250 X 16 million or however many coins there are. The market will determine the price and the coin founders the supply. Can't add 10 billion as easy as that. Unless enough people are convinced and the money flows in. 30 bil is significant but in 2-3 years we will be celebrating 100 bill. Diversify according to market cap and ratio. E.g. 66% in bitcoin. Do for  top 10 coins and continue to do so.
@_date: 2017-04-24 17:21:02
So when you said proven, you didn't mean the last 4 months. So then not proven. So your post makes no sense
@_date: 2017-04-30 17:56:07
yes the Ledger chrome wallet app.
Thanks for your comments man. I don't see how to check browser support. Its a Ledger Nano not Nano S. I have sent support an email and reinstalled the Ledger Wallet app but every time I connect its the same problem.
I am just so glad that I can use the 24 word seed again in a couple of weeks to sweep the BTC as I am expecting quite a few to arrive. 
Thanks for your note on the security of the seed. I think the Nano is screwed and will get a Ledger Nano S anyway as have some ETH to store as well.

The amount of people thinking this makes me think that even if sub 3k does happen, it won't last very long.
In the long run a 3.5k or 2.8k entry really won't make much difference.
@_date: 2019-01-21 13:13:58
Anyone not buying now better not complain during the next bull run that they were not lucky enough to get in at the right time.
Not hearing of Bitcoin can't be an excuse this time. Only those willing to take a risk will get the reward and frankly, buying at this price I don't see as a risk.
So many positive developments in the Bitcoin space. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:28:35
Not enough is written about the dangers of gambling and Bitcoins use in online gambling. For many Bitcoin gambling may be the first gambling that many may do.
People should be aware of the dangers as there is a portion of the population that will be vulnerable to this powerful addiction and would hate to see Bitcoin as an entry into that for anyone.
Well written sir.

Vitalik will die. I have no idea when. This will have an effect on the value of Ether for sure.
You are implying a lot from my statement. An issue BTC doesn't have to deal with.

Anonymous created helps. Imagine having the CEO of the dollar.
Like what happens when Vitalik dies?

These ads I see everywhere. I don't mind if it sounds like it is persuasive. If it does explode there will be people wishing they bought in now and those that made a case for why they think it's a good idea to buy can say 'well I tried'
