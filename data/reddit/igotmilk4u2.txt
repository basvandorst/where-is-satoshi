No problem! Just wrote a review about them so check it out.

That's a great point.  I wonder if there is a delay? I don't use coinbase so I'm not familiar with their procedures.  What are their fees and when you buy, do they lock in the rate at that time or does the transaction get processed later?  I've heard mixed info about this with coinbase.

Use LibertyX if there is a location in your area. They don't play games like Circle plus it's instant.  NO FEES and you have 24 hours to lock in the price.

Minus 10%? Explain PLEASE! Would love to know what you mean.

What do you mean by being able to store USD at their website? I haven't seen that. I'll have to look when I'm on a pc and not mobile.  There really isn't anything more. I looked into them extensively before purchasing.  I think most people will log into their LibertyX account immediately to redeem the pin though. 
Support seems to be very helpful and I'm sure an email to them would work if the pin has not been redeemed in 24 hours.  Also if you search LibertyX on reddit, they have rep that has a reddit account - so a PM to them might work as well.  
As for fees - right now there aren't any until you hit either 1k or 2k in Bitcoin purchases.  After that, it's 1%.  Plus if you buy a btc pin from a merchant who has never sold a LibertyX btc pin, you get $5. It shows those merchants and notates that the $5 promo is available for them - I think it's called "TrailBlazer" or something similar.  I'm sure the 24 hours is in place due to the fluctuations in the btc price.

Seriously - you should look at [LibertyX]( if in the US. Blows LBC out of the water.

I'm very impressed and while my description/review is lengthy, the process is VERY SIMPLE.

Right but they would loose money if they allowed an indefinite amount of time to redeem the pin.  Let's say I buy 1btc and at the time of purchase 1btc is worth $200.  I then hold onto that pin until the price is at $400 and redeem the pin (weeks later).  LibertyX would lose money if they allowed anything beyond 24 hours.  On my 1st purchase, I waited about 18 hours to redeem my pin until the exchange rate was a bit more in my favor. Please correct me if I'm wrong for their reasoning behind the 24 hour redemption period.

Wow - didn't realize you had to wait 5 days. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:11:30
RESEARCH, RESEARCH, **RESEARCH!!**.  I wouldn't touch Circle with my worst enemy's money.
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:18:00
Got it - I was thinking too in depth about the 10% and where that came from :-)
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:05:51
[u/scottrobertson]( how often do you use them?  Also, have you looked at all the posts where they cancel orders when the Bitcoin price isn't in THEIR benefit? I would make sure to have a backup plan in place because it will most likely happen to you sooner than later.

The wiki?  I clicked on your link for [exchanges wiki]( and I didn't see LibertyX. For me, they were the easiest and least intimidating for making my 1st Bitcoin purchase.
@_date: 2015-02-04 16:25:35
Can [LibertyX]( be added to the list above as a way to purchase Bitcoins? They have over 2500 locations in the US alone as well as ATM's.  I just wrote a review about my experience with them after reading other redditors experiences. I personally would choose LibertyX over the examples listed above as they make it VERY easy to purchase Bitcoins especially for beginners or for someone who makes a few Bitcoin purchases here and there.
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:07:05
Three words: **find another source**.  :) I highly suggest LibertyX if it's available where you live. It is as easy as it gets.

The price using LBC doesn't even compare with LibertyX.  I almost went that route but compared the end amount of bitcoins for both LBC and LibertyX and LibertyX won by a long shot.

I thought for sure I would get the $5 promo but the location I went to had been used several times. I don't think they limit the number of times you can get $5 for being the 1st to use a specific location.  If you live in a large city with numerous locations, you could make a nice chunk of change.
Also - not sure if you saw my edit. Curious about storing USD on their website and how that works since they don't have wallets.  Do you have a link? Paging [u/getlibertyx](

Ok, let's say I bought $300 worth of btc.  I can then redeem the pin immediately or watch the btc price over the next 24 hours until it's more favorable to me and then redeem the pin. What I'm buying is a pin # for a bitcoin purchase.  I tell the cashier, I need to use Qpay with LibertyX.  I hand over the $300 and I get a receipt with a LibertyX pin  When I'm ready to redeem, I log into my LibertyX account, enter the pin   Just below where I enter the pin, I enter the wallet address in which I want the bitcoins deposited (mine or someone else's).  Sounds complex but it's VERY simple.  And yes, there can be large change in btc price over 24 hours so when you redeem is up to you.

I am not surprised at all since it is becoming well known Circle does this for various reasons.  One that stands out is when they cancel an order due to Bitcoin price fluctuations. But...it would suck if I was a customer and they did this to me so I'm glad [u/WhiteQuestionMark]( posted this as redditors who haven't logged on in the last month may not know what's going on with Circle.
