Wow, really?
Until iOS 7, I completely regretted getting my iphone 5 over something like the Note 3. It feels so limited. And you can get used to it all you want, but I miss my 'return' hard button.
It also has a hardware problem where the power button doesn't work. It doesn't seem to be a rare issue, because I know 2 other people with the same problem. It almost seems as if Apple was aware, as they included a little button in the settings that will let you turn the screen off via touchscreen.

... Yes. I am a user who is physically unable to use the power button. Thank you for adding 1 Satoshi to the conversation.

In a nutshell, the first version, or 'prototype', will have kinks in the system that only actual use can uncover.

I haven't really studied the altcoins and their unique features. There's too much about bitcoin I still don't comprehend. The biggest hang up is that bitcoin is still so far from mainstream adaption, and altcoins would only take longer.
As I'm not trying to invest for profit, but simply use digital currency, I don't have any immediate needs for altcoins.

You make a really good point, but saying it here is like going to a church on Sunday to preach about Richard Dawkins. These people have blind faith that bitcoin will shoot up to the moon, and they will react negatively to anyone who says otherwise.
Having said that, I bought half a bitcoin at $660/BTC (post-crash, about 8 days ago), then used most of it earlier today at $900 to buy an iPad. I spent $330 and received a $450 product. Of course for every success story there is an equal story of failure, but I suppose that's why people trade in bitcoin. Speculation, hope, blind faith.
Edit: and as of this moment bitcoin is now $850/BTC and falling. will give you the usual runaround of "it's the weekend, it'll rebound higher than ever on Monday", and the logic that the price point per week has been steadily declining and will most likely steady at significantly less than $1000 will fall on deaf ears.

Yep before my first purchase I really disliked the fact that my coins took almost a week to arrive. But now I've realized that I'm going to get the amount I wanted for the price that WAS (and not currently IS) so there's no need to get my panties in a bunch. It might also help that I have some bitcoin in the bank now (thanks Coinbase!) so if I really need to use the coins I don't have to wait for Coinbase's 5 days.
As a sidenote, I was going to do the verification for instant purchase ASAP, but I've decided to wait on that. I know that if I had access to bitcoins instantly, I'd probably be broke on fiat. I'd be rich in bitcoins yet I'd be starving (something we'll hopefully look back on as "remember how hard it was to spend bitcoins in 2013?").
This reply is not really for you but for anyone considering taking the leap. I know these type of comments helped me when I was first starting.
@_date: 2013-12-14 04:46:09
I'd imagine the staff at Coinbase does a lot of waiting around, causing occasional long delays on responses and such. Waiting around for the banks, that is.
I seem way too pro Coinbase after my last few comments. At this time I'd like to disclose that my only affiliation with Coinbase is that I'm a satisfied customer of their services and nothing more.
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:39:54
If you're located in the US, Coinbase is one of, if not the best bet for your investing needs.

People hate realistic comments. Anything not pro-bitcoin will be downvoted.
I've noticed the trend as well. There's always a sharp decline in price before the weekend, and it rebounds somewhat on the weekdays. The thing is, the price has been falling steadily over the last two weeks yet no one here will admit it.
I'm glad I got into bitcoins not as an investment, but as a potentially new way to complete transactions. The volatility was really troubling, as I'd constantly be checking prices (something I've never done with fiat). I got sick of it all and spent most of my bitcoins on Amazon gift cards for my Christmas shopping.
To any newbies thinking about investing in bitcoin: don't. Getting all my information from r/bitcoin gave me such rose-tinted glasses and I realize now that I need a balanced source of information. As it currently stands, spending money in bitcoin form is a pain in the butt. Less than 1% of all merchants accept bitcoin.
I see some fundamental problems with the way bitcoins are handled as well. One of bitcoin's biggest advantages is that we no longer have to pay pesky bank fees for transactions. Yet both Coinbase and my blockchain wallet charge me BTC for their services. Is it not a matter of time before they become major players in the bitcoin game and charge whatever fees they want?
And as for the actual coins, the fact that they are digital is also a turn off. If I deposit money into a bank, it is insured by the government to be there when I go back. If I lose access to my bitcoin wallet, then tough luck finding anyone who cares. This would be fine for some, but there will be many, many cases of lost bitcoins causing negative publicity.
Once the price can steady itself and merchants begin adapting, I'll buy more coins. Until then, I'll stick to fiat. Downvotes to the left.
Edit: This comment was for anyone interested in buying bitcoins. Here is the chart I use to track prices:  Their news ticker actually mixes in bad articles with the good, so you can hear the other side of the argument for a change and form your own opinion.
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:02:34
Your points are all valid, but I think you're missing one crucial component if bitcoin were to become the standard: federal endorsement. If the government simply creates a new tax form for "bitcoin investments/returns/etc.", the general masses would know (or at least blindly believe) that it's not a scam. Because to most of the population, it really does look like a huge scam at this point. Some may take the time to research on their own, but even the results are confusing as hell.
On the other hand, if the government were to reject bitcoins, most people would then become biased against them. All the government would have to do is go after the bitcoin stores (the ones that give you bitcoins in exchange for dollars), and bitcoin would be crippled.
In my humble opinion, the government will **not** endorse bitcoins simply because they cannot control it. If the concept of digital currency seems useful, however, the government will probably just create their own coin. At that point, I'd imagine bitcoin would become similar to bittorent, where many partake despite it's illegal nature, simply because it's easier, cheaper, and faster.
For those wondering, I have a modest amount of bitcoins (&gt;1). I encourage everyone to not hoard coins, but **spend them!** Let retailers know how much money there is in bitcoin and they'll all fall like dominoes. I'm going to do my Christmas shopping with my stash, even if it means simply buying a lot of gift cards and visiting the corresponding stores.

I really don't have any big dreams of "getting rich" with bitcoins. I simply want to use the money I earned, effortlessly.
Yes I hate banks' penalty fees. Yes I hate banking hours. But most of all, I hate that I have to stop by the ATM first to cash my paychecks, then every time I need cash.
@_date: 2013-12-14 04:16:00
It's most likely disappointingly low.
Source: I've started an online business before. Telling someone exactly how much I sold would make my business seem illegitimate as it'd be obvious I was earning less than a third of a full time minimum wage job. It would also discourage actual purchases as the sales numbers are so unprofessionally tiny. Yet you have to have the smile in your face and the confidence in your strut, because you have to convince others of your faith that sales are about to explode. I started the business in lieu of a full time job, so failure is simply not an option. Impossible.

At the same time, if all the countries are putting their money into a single form of currency for digital transactions, it could be a significant amount. I don't want to throw any numbers out of my ass here, but IF* bitcoin becomes the leading coin and gains wide acceptance, it's hard to imagine a bitcoin being less than $100k (in 10 years).

So has anyone here actually bought from this site? Because I've been whining all day about how I can't spend my bitcoins, I'd love to put my money where my mouth is as long as I don't get scammed.
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:11:31
Did you buy it yet? I went through the same thing earlier today. Don't worry about sending them your coins, it'll instantly receive payment and recognize it. After you check out on gyft, go to "My Wallet" and get the redeem code. Go to Amazon and paste that code into your checkout or account. Voila! You have $X that will never expire. Additional tip: if you're buying something expensive and popular (like an iPad), buy out of state so you don't have to  pay tax.

You make a good point, but wouldn't the same apply to current day transactions? The key here is trust: if I have faith that a seller will provide me with goods, I am willing to pay the money before the delivery of said goods.
I go to a shady burger joint, and pay for a burger and fries. It never comes, and they claim it was already served. What can I do to get either my money or my food at that point? Almost nothing.
Trust was my biggest hangup about spending my bitcoins. There were many products I considered buying but I just couldn't bring myself to trust the illegitimate looking sites. I mean, I have about a week's worth of experience with Wordpress (and almost 0 coding knowledge) and my creations looked better than half these stores. In the end, I simply went to gyft.com and bought an Amazon gift card. I trusted gyft.com because of the knowledge that others had their purchases delivered.
TL,DR; try to buy from reputable sites
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:46:11
Not if the bitcoin market becomes robust enough that the seller could pay for his expenditures with bitcoin as well.
This is the obvious big hurdle for bitcoins. While the believers are buying up the coins, there are few trading coins for goods. I have a bit of BTC, and to be honest even if I wanted to spend them, I don't really see how. (I've checked out the black friday specials, none of it interested me)
Once enough vendors accept bitcoins, "cashing out" will become redundant since you can buy the same items you paid cash for, in bitcoins. The price would be very stable and would be at much higher than $1k. This cannot happen for at least a couple years (if ever).
Since every comment on must end with speculation, here's mine: bitcoins get bigger and bigger until the government either endorses it (by giving it independent tax laws and such) or the government creates their own coin, and the federal support of the new coin would be the end of bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-14 04:36:22
Could you post your results? I want to buy (a lot) but I just can't get over that website. Especially after that one post where someone got scammed out of a PS4.
If you take a picture of your jerky and upload it with the title "Look What I Bought With Bitcoins!", you'll at least get some link karma. And you'll have jerky.
@_date: 2013-12-14 04:05:50
And you're making it worse by adding nothing to the discussion.
If you really wanted people to stop posting discussion threads, you'd message them privately. You're just trying to obtain comment karma. And inadvertently making this sub shittier.

Hi, thank you so much for following through with the questions.
As for the second riddle, I believe I have the answer:
Put 3 bars on the left and 3 bars on the right of the scale.  
-If they are even, then the fool's bar is one of the remaining two. Put one on each and the lighter one is the answer.  
-Otherwise, one side will be lighter than the other. Take the 3 from the lighter side, pick two and put one on each side of the scale. If one is lighter than the other, it is the fool's gold. If they are the same, then the remaining bar is the fool's gold.
@_date: 2013-12-14 03:11:00
The point of it is to give one access to one's bitcoins *immediately*. Yes in a few years I hope to purchase goods effortlessly using bitcoins through my phone, but for now, my bitcoins are just sitting in my wallet. I'd use the hell out of this card until merchants adapt.
