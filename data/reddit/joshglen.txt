I bought a 3d printer that is now broken when it was $700. Now a $5000 paperweight.

I use bitcoinwisdom.com

Cashapp might work, but it takes a while. Check your dm's.

It says it was mined by btc.com though.

Damn, you guys are going easy. I require a contract for someone's soul for identity verification purposes in addition to everything else.

I did this a few times. Bitcoin goes to gyft for a starbucks gift card, and then I pay using my phone. It feels the same way to me.

This. This is my goal.

That seems about right, you would buy the bitcoins from them and withdraw it into your own wallet as soon as you can.

Don't worry, I didn't make the transfer. It just turned out being that way when it was at 20k back in 2017 because the mempool was so full that to get a gaurenteed next block transaction, the fee would be greater than 1400-2000 satoshis per byte.

This is actually great! When it was 20k back in 2017 it cost between $100-150 to move btc, but not in this one the mempool seems to have cleared up! That's how we know we are not going too fast.

You can buy from a cash based ATM, such as Redleaf ATM in some areas.
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:07:36
 it technically is... (be warned of the risk of losing your money because of glitches though)
@_date: 2018-04-27 12:18:57
I would highly reccomend redleaf ATM, if you have any of those in your area (Although they do charge a hefty fee). Also, cryptovoucher.io might be a good idea.

Yeah, it's just an advertisement for some personal avatar news thing. This was probably all a marketing trick to bring up hype.

Take a look at using a segwit wallet if you are not already, it can decrease the fee for you.
