If you're telling it to a newbie, use what shervintwo said: Bitcoin is the internet of money!  It makes much more sense.  But on a technical level, it's BitTorrent.  Say it's the money version of how BitTorrent works, it's like the internet of money :)

I deposited Bitcoin yesterday to Cryptsy and it was credited around 6 confirmations, traded for Peercoin as usual, withdraw was sent to me within 20ish minutes..

Only problem there is data storage aspect isn't really rewarded directly, it's the miners.  If we are mining with our hard drives that's one thing, but so far people have been maxing out their electrical panels with devices that crunch numbers.  But it's p2p, it's going to be strong enough with just a few nodes.  Although a bottleneck, I don't think it can fail since so many services will be built on top of it, all needing to be up to date.
@_date: 2014-09-25 21:38:15
how many outputs is the maximum for a transaction? 
because..  I could..  have all 41 million addresses in a mysql database and try to do a multisend to all of them.  or, multiple transactions, depending on the maximum.  I might be able to send 1 satoshi to tons of addresses and the fee is probably something I could hyptothetically afford.
not like I would, or this post makes any sense at all, but I think it is theoretically possible to have control over 41 million addresses with unspent 1-satoshi outputs.

So let's say you give 9 BTC to BFL, converted automatically to USD, for $1200.  Alright?  
Now BFL has $1200.  
They take that $1200, and buy 9 BTC for themselves later that day.  Do they do this?  Who knows!  But it's EXACTLY like my example said. 
Now a year later you ask for a refund, BTC is now $600 a pop, and so they tell you they can only refund you 2 BTC.  So they send you 2 BTC, and they are up 7 BTC.
People downvoting me like math was just invented yesterday.

10 minute blocks. That's the ticket.  Dogecoin's 60 second block time is not sufficient for every node in the network to download a (500kb+ eventually) block in &lt;60 seconds.  
Satoshi didn't just guess at the 10 minute block thing.  It was very carefully calculated.
IMHO that was a mistake they made when making Dogecoin.  
@_date: 2014-03-19 18:17:49
I think they should have stayed the same.  The blocks were already getting pretty full, as Bitcoin expands in transaction volume it will get tight now because of all these dust transactions.
On the plus side, since I specify in the client a 0.0005 fee per transaction anyway, I will have even more of a priority!  :)

yeah, kinda.  except it will add 30 GB per year to the blockchain, ticketmaster sells more tickets in 1 year than all of the transactions in the blockchain, currently.
I don't want to have a hard drive on my computer just for ticketmaster's justin beiber ticket transactions..
I don't think the "end goal" is the blockchain growing to terabytes of size.. and people using bitcoin to buy 5-cent candies down the street.  I think there will be services built on top of bitcoin that send fewer transactions but utilizing bitcoin as the core for moving money around.

Well, just go by market capitalization.  We're around the $8 billion mark now.
I just googled how much it costs to go to the olympics.  Apparently each event has it's own ticket price, ranging from $15 to $500, depending on where you sat and other factors.  Opening ceremony might cost a lot more.
So if you had $5,000 to $10,000, you could probably have a great time.  So you need a 100x to 200x increase in Bitcoin value, around $800 billion to $1.6 trillion market cap for your $50 to buy you a spectator seat at the Olympics.  
Do-able.  I think them accepting Bitcoin all over Japan is enough to achieve this alone.  6 years from now?  Totally possible.

@_date: 2014-06-20 00:59:49
Bitcoin can also be 51% attacked, both systems are flawed.
I think your description is partly valid although a little bit narrow-minded.  
Bitcoin releases an update that REQUIRES all users to change over to the new version for a fix in order for the blockchain to continue downloading, this can be the notion of one individual or dev on the Bitcoin team, they could essentially put whatever they want in the new version of the code.  I find that to be a somewhat centralized trait.
I wish someone made a good ELI5 explanation for the points you raise.  Everytime I mention Peercoin people link me to those same articles, but they don't make sense to me.

bear in mind satoshi didn't write bitcoin, he got sirius (Martti Malmi) to write it.  satoshi had the concept and the actual underlying ruleset/whitepaper/concept.    also keep in mind that it was a program written in C++ which is neither nix nor windows exclusive, and could just be compiled for either os. so outlook + windows bitcoin client aren't a good comparison.
@_date: 2014-06-20 02:43:24
I think you missed the point.  
The losing Bitcoins and PHP / busybox thing are completely unrelated from each other.  Totally.  But, after 6 months of silence (and the whole world wanting him crucified) he came to twitter and said "What would we do without PHP?" it would be funnier than him saying busy box.

I've had a bad experience.  
I got an email from Coinbase saying that someone transferred all my funds out.  Stolen, instantly.  Sure it wasn't much, 0.1 BTC, thankfully...  But instead of having email confirms on withdrawals, they send you an email once your money is already gone.  Also, some other sites send you an email when there has been a successful login so you know instantly that someone is in your account.  To take it one step further, some sites like CaVirtex require you to email confirm every browser so outside computers cannot even log into the account without having access to the email account.
I sent them all this information in much greater detail why it concerns me and they said they had more important things to do.  
This is why I'll never use Coinbase.  I appreciate what they're doing for Bitcoin, but it's downright sloppy. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:51:52
Definitely something to explore.  I wouldn't put much thought into it, but it may be a piece of the puzzle somehow and not to be ignored...  
@_date: 2014-04-02 00:04:14
I guess they assume every customer of theirs has a cell phone.  
Look at Steam for example.  You need to do email confirms for every browser and computer.  It works great.  Your email should be very secure, in fact, your gmail has the ability to have 2-factor:
So instead of having 10 sites text me all the time, just use 2FA on your email.  Now your email is secure, thus ALL of your accounts that rely on it are also secure. 
I don't have a cell on a monthy plan, so when my 'minutes' expire I am often without the cell for a week or two, sometimes more.. I don't really require it.  I would hate to NEED to keep my phone activated because all these Bitcoin sites require it.  It's completely unnecessary.  Would you like it if you had to confirm via text message every time you logged into Steam from a different computer or browser?  What about Reddit?  And Bitcointalk?  and Facebook?  Hell, why don't we have SMS requirements on every site we access? It's pointless.  Everything should rely on an email account and have SMS required on there to prevent unauthorized access, **IMHO**.  
Right now Coinbase's logic is this:
Have a cell phone?  Enable 2FA and your money will not be stolen.
Don't have a cell?  Only a matter of time before you get cleaned out.
These emails would be FREE to send out.  They make enough money over there to set up a system like this.  If someone tries to log into my account and gets the password wrong, I WANT AN EMAIL telling me there was an attempt!  We're not talking about a forum account here, this is a place where people hold money!

What about the Bitcoin marketplace?  
deleting: 
history: 
So Martti Malmi created the bitcoin marketplace in August 2009.. and it was stripped out in 2010... 
Sooooo...   
A bit more than the port.  I think Martti wrote the whole thing TBH.  
["He was removed from the list of project developers on bitcoin.org in June 2011. The same time Satoshi left. He still owns the bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org domains."](
I'm not saying he's Satoshi, but I'm saying he had the knowhow to put it all together and I think he was hired by Satoshi to do the original groundwork.  Much more involved than just the linux port.

Sure, I think they could co-exist.  Something along those lines, we don't exactly need every transaction from McDonalds in the chain.  It's bad enough we have blockchain gambling and that accounts for a large percent of the transactions today.

I'm just saying they had the $1200 back when they could have bought 9 BTC.  Also through the bitpay interface you can choose what percent is paid to them in USD and what percent is paid in BTC.  We don't know what they were doing, but it is possible that they invoiced in USD and only ever received BTC.  I've used bitpay before and it is trivial to do that.
I'm sure when they sold a unit for $1200 they weren't selling them "at cost" so 100% of the $1200 went towards employees and such.

Yeah because there are users who legitimately need to send 100,000 requests for money, why should they change the policy!  
TL;DR: I'm closing my account on behalf of their ignorance.
edit: [Feels good.](  Simply, painless account deletion process.
I am **not** encouraging people to close their account by this.  I was mentioning to Coinbase about account security before and they didn't listen to me.  I had all the Bitcoin taken from my account and all I did was receive an email saying it was transferred.  There is no email informing you that your account has been logged into (like BTC-E does), there is no email confirmation of account withdrawals (like BTC-E), there is no email confirmation of browser sessions (like CaVirtex), all they do is tell you ONCE your money is gone.  If you live in Canada and someone logs in from an IP from the other side of the world, they just let them in.  I told them about this and they changed nothing.  Your money is NOT secure there.  
Their front page says SAFE AND SECURE.  BANK LEVEL SECURITY.  Security for Your Peace of Mind.  We take careful measures to ensure that your bitcoin is as safe as possible.  Well they don't care about securing your account.  If your account is compromised they have no safe guards in place except mobile 2 factor..  Well what if I don't have a cell.

Well, the theory out there is that he had about 50 computers mining from the beginning, all running the really inefficient software bitcoin miner.  
He knows how to get Bitcoins, to mine them.  If he needed more, he would probably mine them a lot more likely than he would buy them.  He knows he would have to buy more powerful hardware to keep up, and he probably has some ASICs purrin' away right now.

I like to think about it like there is a bigger purpose to all of this.  Do you think he planned on selling Bitcoins when the market cap is a measily $7 billion US?  If Bitcoin works, he could have enough money to start a new country.  Maybe he is going to conquer the world.  Maybe he kept mining this entire time.  He could easily cash out 0.005% of his total holdings along the way and we wouldn't really notice. He's probably put a few bucks under his mattress over the years.

They refused to give up the keys.. but if you read the article, Lavabit caved and printed out the keys spanning 11 pages.  The government is too lazy to "manually enter in all 2000-some characters" meanwhile it's like a million (or gajillions of) times faster than if they were to brute force the keys.  
And don't they have software so that they could just, I dunno, put the 11 sheets through a flatbed scanner and it read it into a digital string?  And I bet they have one of those fancy multifunctions at the government that they could scan all 11 sheets with the push of 1 button.  
And they are charging Lavabit $5000 a day late fees on information that was none of their f&amp;%king business in the first place, and they need it in a more convenient format??? 
But I wouldn't be starting a praise Lavabit campaign so soon if they bailed so quickly to release the private keys.

Yeah but by bitcoin could-have-should-have hindsight logic, that's like $13,000 today.  And 16 months from now, Bitcoins could be much more expensive (I know he meant wait time, but if we're talking hindsight you might as well dream), $180,000 divided by 90 is $2000.

Well, delivery times when ordering Block Erupters from [WTCR]( make it much easier to calculate earnings.  Get your miner in a couple of days instead of a year and at a better price!!

Well you got to the blade GUI?  Should be smooth sailing from there.  My secret weapon will be available soon, makes flashing 1000 blades a snap ;)  It started out as a simple script and now has turned into an entire OS lmao

I take it back, I forgot that this was the guy who shut down the company to resist them.  Props to this guy.  I thought I read the article closely but I missed that key fact, and I remember reading about the shutdown last year and I didn't make the connection between the two until your reply.  The man is a hero.

aaaaaand it's gone!
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:59:08
Watch it closely.  Are you sure about that?
@_date: 2013-10-04 05:22:55
This blows my mind that they are in control of the coins.  And the address you mention (1F1tAaz5x1HUXrCNLbtMDqcw6o5GNn4xqX) seems to have tons of payments coming in.  94 transactions.  
So like, can we get this tagged on blockchain.info so that when they send funds in there, we could see it fly by on the latest transactions feed as like **1 BTC -&gt; seized_by_fbi**

Tons of great shops here:
@_date: 2013-10-06 19:01:45
on windows:
1.) Download [stratum proxy]( (Windows EXE link)
2.) Put it in a folder where you'll remember.  Like Desktop.  Then make a shortcut to the EXE.  
3.) Right click on that shortcut and go properties.  Under the 'shortcut' tab, look at the 'target' box.  At the end of the string it should contain your pool info.  Like:
**C:\Users\winuser\stratum\mining_proxy.exe -o us2.eclipsemc.com -p 3333 -cu user_worker -cp pass**
4.) Hit okay, then try the shortcut out.  It probably works awesomely.  
5.) Now if you computer's network is 192.168.1.xxx, then you're in luck.  If not, unplug your computer from the network (or use a spare laptop), change the IP address of your computer to be 192.168.1.10, subnet mask 255.255.255.0, gateway 192.168.1.1, DNS server is pointless but put 8.8.8.8 for the hell of it.  
6.) Now turn on a blade, plug it into your computer.  Your computer should now be able to access the config page, go to 192.168.1.254:8000 in a browser.  Voila.  Set the IP address you want on the blade and set the server to be the windows box we just set up stratum on.  A note of warning, you need to set 2 servers, if you just set 1 it wont save.  Another note of warning, I had two servers set for backup one time.   My router rebooted and they both lost their IP address so the mining stopped, be sure to set the servers' to have static IP addresses.  If the worker/user/pool stuff is set up in the shortcut, you don't have to configure it in the blade itself (leave the default mumbo jumbo there).  
That should point you in the right direction.

That's EXACTLY what I told myself when I bought a car with Bitcoin this summer.  
[Wanna race?](
I cashed in some ASICMINER shares for it.  Traded 35 shares back when they were up at the top, figured if these things drop to zero at least I have my 'Sup.  Shoulda traded all the shares in that day but I'm still hopeful of the next gen.  The car cost me 5x the USD price already though, could have 5 supras here instead, but the shares plummeted to like 9x less than they were :)

I think this might go beyond freezing their account.  They can probably yoink cash straight out of their bank accounts if they didn't close it.  And if they did, they would probably resort to legal action (assuming everything goes as poorly as possible for them over the next few months).

$10 loss is not the end of the world, much greater losses are incurred along the Bitcoin road, plus the card is worth $10 IMHO.  I wonder if we are allowed more than 1 card?
The $1.50 per tx fee bites but in emergency situations it will be handy.  Just trying it out and experiencing one of the first massively available BTC -&gt; Interac cards is worth it, even with the high fees it's a card I'd like in my wallet.  Use it rarely.  But if I could pay $10 a month for unlimited transactions I'd use it more often.  Hell, I'd pay $30 a month.  But then as those words leave my fingers, you do the math and $10 a month (what my bank charges me for unlimited) gets you 6.66 (lol) transactions if you paid $1.50 each.  So that's like using your debit card once every 4 or 5 days, you will only accrue $10 a month.  Not that bad if you look at it like that.  Just don't buy coffee every day after and before work with it :)

Three cheers for GPU season!

Avalon is finished.  He refunded all pending orders and it looks like doom and gloom.  BFL is also finished.  They offer people a 5 GH/s Jalapeno for $250 that will ship in 12 months when you could buy a 10 GH/s Block Erupter from [WTCR]( for like $600 and get it in 2 days.  No one in their right mind would order a BFL anymore.  
The other guys, Bitfury, KNC, CoinTerra, are the ones that might change the game.
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:17:40
it would certainly make for a nice addition to an already secure brainwallet.  As long as it's not like "correct horse battery stapler 753" because a reasonable amount of combinations will probably be looked at by people through the course of time.

engrave the key to a copper plate.  that'll last a flood and a half!  this way your private keys, if lost at sea, become pirate treasure!  if you have  100 copies of your private key, on CDs, hard drives, USBs, and paper wallets.. and then your house burns down?  hopefully you have them in a fireproof safe.. or have them engraved on heavy metal!

$50 a month fee, steeper than probably necessary, Virtex?

yeah use bitlisten instead.

I submitted a company to be part of this, and haven't gotten a response yet.  There isn't a whole lot of time left, are we going to get more information next week?

how much for shipping ?
@_date: 2013-09-20 03:19:49
$300,000 reported (so far) in like 3 days.  
How many users got a refund and didn't report it? It could already be a few million.
@_date: 2013-10-13 07:46:50
split into pennies?
and what's with [this address]( why were the 134 BTC left behind?
@_date: 2013-10-18 18:09:48
They've gone dim a few times in the past, at least there's a redirected message up and a [forum post]( that lets you know they're certainly working on it.  And the message saying hard drive replacement, usually there is no warning of failure to give them time to inform the userbase in advance.  I wish all my dead drives had informed me to back up data just before they died.  
It's a plausible scenario.  I wouldn't go as far as to say they lost trust based on an outage. 
The reddit/twitter accounts, that's another story.  /popcorn.
@_date: 2013-08-29 07:54:05
anyone know if these have network on them or do you *need* to use the USB?
edit: looks like they aren't USB at all!

This seems like a future business idea. 
Couldn't a pool do this if they were big enough to find blocks with any decent frequency?  I mean a company like ASICMINER could theoretically, but I think a pool is an easier solution.  
Users in this pool could paste in transaction IDs that they want confirmed.  They issue the pool a bounty to have a specific problematic transaction to be included in the next block they find.  Since the pool doesn't have to pay to include it, (and if there was a mini fee like your 0.0001 BTC they get that) plus offer the pool a bounty of 0.0005 BTC or something.  Since it's a pool, it is easier to get 0.0005 BTC to the pool because it will already be in your balance from mining.  
Is that possible?
One time I did a huge withdrawal from deepbit, like 80 BTC and they send it without a tx fee.  It took like 4 hours or something and I was starting to worry it would just float around in space forever.  I even asked the deepbit guys like wtf but they said it will always confirm, and it did.  
But what if I needed that tx to confirm because it's extremely urgent?  
You see a tx incoming with no fee, you grab the tx id and go to the pool, paste it to them and the bounty is set.  Tx gets included when they find a block, and hopefully that is soon, it would have to be a big pool.  If another miner gets the block and the tx is included in it, then it is trivial to detect this and it just cancels the bounty.

If you want to be certain you'll get it (i.e.: not get scammed), just buy them from [WTCR](

ah but an unofficial one :)
the official reseller is [WTCR](

'yall should just hang out at [Bitcoin Trading]( :)
@_date: 2013-10-06 19:44:11
Basically.  You could go straight from the computer to the blade with a crossover.  You could try using a switch as well.  I usually have a dedicated computer for doing this, but then I found out last week that it is possible to have two IPs on an interface and you could interact with the 192.xxx network and your primary network at the same time, sort of blew my mind.  The simplest path is probably the best one, how many blades do you have to set up?  If you have tons of them, I have a secret weapon for setting them up which is almost complete.. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 05:15:02
1 week of waiting in KNC-land sounds a lot shorter than waiting 1 week in  BFL-land.  
@_date: 2013-10-06 20:22:41
Reset the blade?  There's two pins closest to the network jack that when you cross them (tweezers, random piece of wire, etc) resets the blade.  You can see the light flicker during this reset.

How about this: don't sell your Bitcoins?  Seems smarter than avoiding an exchange to sell them.  
You'll just inevitably regret selling eventually.
