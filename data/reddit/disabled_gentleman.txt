Thanks for posting this.  Not a good looking chart is it.  Oh well, if I'd stayed with Apple in the 80s or 90s I'd be all set now.

I just checked my bitcoin account for the first time in two months and wtf happened to all my money.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:20:24
Everything this guy says is right.  Really though, as a long time investor bitcoin is a bit of a concern.  There's nothing tangible.  I'm not a programmer so I don't know how bitcoin works or how to get around its security measures.  Are these fake coins dumped into the market?  Can somebody find a way to sell billions of bitcoins that don't exist?
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:21:50
This is correct, investors are disappointed speculators.
@_date: 2017-03-22 01:40:21
What's the best lite kind of wallet client? Multibit?
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:15:07
Ok, looks like it's the same thing as with circle. Thanks for the info. I guess I'll just leave it as it is, I don't understand how to use private wallets so I'd probably just lose all my btc if I tried.
@_date: 2017-03-22 03:33:37
Thanks. I don't like that you need to decrypt the words to get your private key, that seems like it might be a problem if the client disappeared but I guess that's not too likely.
@_date: 2017-03-31 10:45:28
Op full of shit and thread full of vultures.
@_date: 2017-03-22 03:57:09
If it's a 40 million dollar deal you think is good, you make time for it.
@_date: 2017-03-22 03:32:18
It looks like there's a .0005 BTC fee for the 2 factor, that's pretty high.
@_date: 2017-03-21 23:03:57
Can you recommend a tutorial for doing this?
@_date: 2017-03-21 23:48:25
Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2017-03-28 05:23:04
As much as I support Bitcoin core I do think might makes right. Whichever camp has the strongest computer should probably get its way. If it's based on "consensus of the community" and not hashing power what's to stop a bunch of Russian trolls with thousands of fake accounts from pretending to be the community and getting their way?
@_date: 2017-08-07 08:23:05
Over nine thousand penises
@_date: 2018-06-15 02:17:42
Last I heard Bitcoin was twenty grand. Has it jumped to a hundred yet?
@_date: 2019-08-03 06:15:00
Doesn’t make any difference if we hodle or not, 97% of the Bitcoin is owned by bill gates so it’s up to him what the price is.
@_date: 2015-08-18 15:48:55
Alright lets get a logo on that window son!  That'll get you more advertising than you know.
@_date: 2015-08-28 20:01:15
Whoa totally not necessary, thanks friend!
@_date: 2015-08-18 12:46:32
But people gamble with money because they can buy beer with their winnings.  The problem with bitcoin is it's 4 billion dollars of value where there is nothing.  All someone has to do is make something better.  Like, a way to send USD anonymously and cheaply.
@_date: 2015-08-28 19:56:02
Thank you kindly!  Actually I think your making it easy to buy bitcoins is extremely important and helpful because for me to get them the only way is by bartering for them on the internet.  So aside from suddenly getting millions of people signed up for bitcoin accounts (and good luck with that, big companies have a hard time getting people to sign up for financial accounts) this is big and a fantastic thing for bitcoin, thanks again.
@_date: 2015-08-28 17:40:04
Thanks for making Bitcoins more obtainable.
@_date: 2017-04-06 16:42:37
I love the panhandling at the bottom. "Please donate so I can buy toys for orphans." Please. He says he "was able" to donate, not that he did!
@_date: 2017-04-05 07:04:38
I did .00005 the other day and it was confirmed in an hour.
@_date: 2017-04-05 19:13:25
Looks like he's about 15 years old and trying to stand up straight.
@_date: 2016-02-08 00:15:30
I know what you're saying but I made a huge profit on my bitcoin, knowing it was high risk.  I was cool letting that amount go if that's any indication.
@_date: 2015-04-30 10:04:31
Which would value bitcoin at 4.2 billion dollars.
@_date: 2015-09-10 06:21:18
There's no value in it, it's just hopes and dreams!  As for the technology, anyone could make their own bitcoin.  The first isn't necessarily the best.  There's just no bottom because there's really nothing to hold it up.  
@_date: 2015-09-16 20:09:19
How come it says there's two comments here but nothing shows up?
@_date: 2015-09-15 05:30:48
Bitcointalk is terrible, I got banned from that forum for asking some question.
@_date: 2015-09-17 11:00:18
You're right.
@_date: 2015-09-17 20:23:03
"Only one currency in the world has devalued more that the ruble — bitcoin," he joked.
Haha what a class act, funny guy.  The Russians are our friends, the bitruble would be awesome for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-10 21:37:54
Lol no, bitcoins are just lights on a screen.  Gold is very real and very rare, and they can't just make it appear out of thin air.
@_date: 2015-09-14 06:46:02
Totally not worth it, the miners are making their money from new coins anyway.  Besides the transactions are anonymous so there's no way they know it's you that donated to them.
@_date: 2015-09-18 07:11:43
Ah, but the government can do whatever it wants!
@_date: 2015-09-01 22:52:08
Well she's right because you have to take money out of your account to turn it into bitcoin to use anyway so there's not really a point.  At least, for her purposes.
@_date: 2015-09-01 21:25:02
I decided to read it and saw the funny quote from the clever Irish girl: "Knowing very little about what bitcoin is, I don't really know the difference between that and just using an automatic debit withdrawal from your bank account," she said. "It just sounds like a blinged-up term for using an automatic withdrawal from your account ... I don't see the advantage."
@_date: 2015-09-01 00:52:10
@_date: 2015-09-25 22:21:56
That is awesome.  Go Iron Mike!  This is totally going to get more people buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-30 09:48:34
The one on the left, definitely.
@_date: 2015-09-14 06:03:22
Why do people put in transaction fees?  You don't even need to pay a fee.
@_date: 2015-09-01 17:41:08
LOL this is big news?
@_date: 2015-09-14 06:08:36
This guy knows what's up.  That's what I love about bitcoin, at any time I know I can access my money like if I was doing something cool or illegal, like running from the law and they're tapping my accounts.
@_date: 2015-09-25 22:29:28
Bitcoin's going to be around forever.  There's still people running the ICQ client so why would they shut off their bitcoin server when that's actual money. I think the block chain technology will be picked up and bitcoin will be left behind, but BTC will be the preferred internet currency of the underworld for many decades to come.
@_date: 2015-09-17 22:28:01
Very clever guy.  I'm sold on Circle.
@_date: 2015-09-23 20:31:19
It's getting harder to get bitcoin boys.
@_date: 2015-09-18 18:24:45
Scammed by a fast talker who promised him millions?  Maybe but that's a cynical response, maybe Iron Mike's just a bitcoin fan and doesn't really care if they use his name because it won't be much work for him.
@_date: 2015-09-27 06:00:48
Yeah dude it's like impossible to use.  How do you even get bitcoin? Faucets?  If I wanted to pay for something in bitcoin it would be at least 5x the work of just paying for it in cash.  It's still total nerd stuff, we're on the leading edge.  Once personal wallet programs are better and cold storage is easier bitcoin will take off.
@_date: 2016-10-26 01:59:59
I think the problem is that there's so much scamming with Bitcoin. It's really ridiculous how rampant the scamming is. If you try to sell Bitcoin for PayPal there's like a fifty percent chance you're going to get scammed so they want no part if it. It sours people's idea of PayPal. Like, I never had any problem with PayPal until I sold some for PayPal and found out what charge backs and disputes were. I'm not saying Bitcoin is bad, I like it and it has its uses, but it's not really compatible with PayPal.
@_date: 2017-05-16 08:09:53
He will. Never sell Bitcoin for PayPal.
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:26:07
Never heard of it. But now there's money in another unknown fly by night crypto coin. This is good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:24:23
They're probably saving the data they generate until there's a lot of loaded wallets then they'll raid them. Even if you downloaded and ran the website offline there may be an algorithm to their so called "random generating" that they know.
@_date: 2015-10-13 05:59:19
"We needs a solution" this guy does look like Cleatus.
@_date: 2015-10-12 07:09:55
Welp so much for Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2015-10-12 07:11:57
Haha Canada's been aware of it all along.
@_date: 2017-07-13 09:58:54
In person for cash might be a good method because only that guy knows who you are, but you'd be hard pressed to get millions of dollars that way, and the buyer wouldn't be too pleased with you when his purchase was worthless the next day. Foreign accounts I don't know anything about that, wouldn't be my first choice.
@_date: 2017-05-16 07:59:28
This is good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-13 08:22:01
Don't worry, I haven't. But I'm pretty sure it can be done though, by someone who thinks of something no one else has. I'm wondering how they would proceed if and when it happened.
@_date: 2015-10-12 19:39:19
Swear words and all?
@_date: 2017-07-13 08:25:41
There might be trouble and you don't want to get caught so you probably don't want it going straight into your bank account.
@_date: 2015-10-17 20:23:46
This is what I said all along but I used the term anonymous.  It's a secure and anonymous system of payment like cash, pretty cool.
@_date: 2015-10-16 23:08:15
I haven't seen it go up like this before.
@_date: 2017-07-13 09:33:08
I said hacking not fapping!
@_date: 2017-07-13 09:53:58
Yeah you could definitely move it into other wallets, but I was thinking what if you found a really brutal flaw that would cause it to lose a lot or all of its value quickly. But I guess it would depend on the flaw, if you got a guys private key the market probably wouldn't care too much, maybe you just got lucky, or maybe he was careless with it and you found it etc. If it was from tricking the network by mirroring it or something and duping coins it could just crash the price overnight and your wallets wouldn't be worth anything. That's when you'd need the quick cash.
@_date: 2015-10-17 21:53:42
You should just get a Circle account.  I don't know how bitcoin works but I don't have to.
@_date: 2017-07-13 08:47:44
I disagree. It would take a smart guy sure, but the smarter you are the more you realize you don't know a damn thing, I think a genius computer programmer almost guaranteed wouldn't be pro at banking or knowing how to hide money from a forensic accountant. So he'd need some help, that'd be smart.
@_date: 2017-07-13 09:14:59
Idiots get mad at intelligent discussion. If you'd ever been to school you'd know summer vacation just started.
