You really shouldnt spread your bullshit rumors. Rogers pool is not powered by bitmain at all.

You ridiculous conspiracy theorists should really take your tinfoil hats off and go outside. Running a pool does not mean you are taking over anything. If you dont agree with what the pool is signaling for you have the right as a miner to disconnect and point your hash rate elsewhere. Stop being so fucking stupid and throwing these wild accusations around that you have ZERO PROOF to back up.

So are all you geniuses that claim Roger is buying hash power setting up internet lynch mobs for car dealerships or credit cards that offer cash back on purchases or vehicles? I mean that is basically the same thing right? They are 'buying' clients with their offers in order to attract more business. You guys better go out and bash their names all over the internet as well...I mean fair is fair.

You realize a USB stick is so slow you arent helping to decentralize anything right?

You dumbasses are still stuck on the asicboost thing? You realize that nobody ever proved it was ever used by bitmain right? Instead of seeing their support for a protocol they believe in you have to chalk it up to some nefarious scheme. People like you are what make this community so toxic. Spreading unsubstantiated bullshit and passing it off as fact will do nothing but harm crypto in general.

I never said anything about it being a charity.

You must be one hell of a psychiatrist to make all these judgements on someone you have never met.

This is why people that dont understand how things work should just stay quiet. Running a pool DOES NOT equal 'owning' anything.

You people are so pathetic. Probably just mad he has enough money to buy your entire life over and over and over again.

I am pretty sure he has nothing to prove to some random fuckwit like you on reddit. All you do on here is whine about him. Either you have some obsession with him and are seriously damaged upstairs or you are just a sad sac hiding behind a keyboard because you are too much of a bitch to do it in the real world.

Existing and being used are two different things. Is that not obvious? It was old code in the miners for almost a year before anyone decided to go on the anti bitmain crusade and claimed that bitmain was going to shut your miners off.

You deserve to lose your money if you left that much in an online wallet. With all the news of exchanges being hacked, shut down, etc over the years the fact that you left that much in Coinbase makes it 100% your fault. As the saying goes....a fool and his money are soon parted

The amount of stupidity you exhibit by saying something so off base like this with zero facts to back it up really makes you look like an idiot.
