Some would say that all debate is merely semantic :) And let's be clear. I hold bitcoin. Some would say I hold a lot of bitcoin. And I'm very pro bitcoin.
But I still agree with Buffet that the private keys themselves don't have any intrinsic value. They're just values. Sure, the system as a whole has value, and it provides a valuable service. But in owning bitcoins you don't own a share of the companies like Coinbase, or hardware like a miner etc.

Personally it seems obvious that it's more efficient in a number of different scenarios to me. Hence it's current rate of adoption! It seems as obvious to me as it is that email is more efficient in certain scenarios that snail mail!
This lack of flexibility, and therefore inability for the currency to be manipulated by a central authority, is exactly one of the reasons so many people are attracted to it!

Ok right. You were disagreeing with the fact that people choose the government in a democracy not the fact that the U.S. is not a good example of democracy (which I incorrectly assumed because that's what most people would take exception to in my comment).
Yes I agree with all of your points above. But tyranny of the majority over the minority is still better than tyranny of the minority of the majority. And, at least we have some idea of human rights which prevents the worst of it.

Nobody needs to wait 10 mins. A mere matter of seconds for network propagation is vastly more than secure enough.
Explain to me how exactly you're going to pull off a double spending attack for less than the price of a stick of gum?
I think you need to wake up and do some reading because you clearly have no idea what you are talking about.
Edit: Also the hashing algo, and the transaction times are unrelated. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:57:52
Very valid concern. One that I share also. I can envisage an alt-coin with different generation properties moving in to replace BTC if this is indeed the case. The main idea of bitcoin will remain though, the solution to the double-spend problem. I'm bullish enough to be 'cautiously optimistic' about that.
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:45:29
Personally I think a truecrypt drive saved in my dropbox is secure enough (an no I'm not joking). It's backed up in multiple locations and has a very, very strong passphrase. The only risk I guess is that somebody with access to the file manages to install a keylogger on my machine. Given that I've not had a single virus, ever, I don't think there's a high likelihood. 
Am I missing something?
Edit: My concern with paper wallets is that something will happen to them, and also the hassle.

I don't think you understand what the phrase 'economies of scale' means. It's used to refer to the efficiencies gained by doing or producing something en mass as opposed to just one or two. Its usually because the one off overhead costs can be spread across many.

Hello Jimmy,
I would just like to say: Thank-you very much for brining the world Wikipedia and for working so hard to keep it free from adverts. It's such a massively useful resource to all of humanity. I think sometimes people take it for granted despite the fact that they use it all the time (myself included). You really do deserve a lot more recognition that you get IMO.
I have donated in the past and will continue to do so in the future. Thank-you for taking the time to investigate BTC and for seriously considering it as an option. I can understand your concerns but I really do believe that the pros outweigh the cons. 
I have sent a small contribution to your address.
Keep up the wonderful work.
@_date: 2014-05-23 05:48:08
Don't be sorry. It's him that should be sorry. Hopefully you can see by the number of down votes that his thoughts aren't shared by the rest of us. You've made the decision to get into bitcoin and we should be encouraging that not making you fell like a piece of shit for an innocent comment. If you came here trying to peddle doge it would be a different story but that's clearly not the case.
@_date: 2014-04-04 08:12:24
That is one of the problems here. Everybody who's smart enough to understand and fix these problems is also smart enough to realise that Doge is a waste of time.
Boom. I said it. Shots fired. Prepare for for downvotes from angry Shibes.
@_date: 2014-09-05 14:06:57
Do you realise that this graph takes into account not just addresses, but transactions on those addresses? An address has to make at least one transaction to be included in the graph that day. 
While not a completely accurate measure of adoption, I still believe this to be a relatively indicative proxy. Sure, I could generate thousands of transactions between thousands of addresses in order to increase the numbers on this graph but I would say that's unlikely what's causing this given that other metrics such as merchant adoption are increasing similarly.

@_date: 2014-03-14 22:44:18
Buffett has averaged 20% a year, every year, since he started. His investment principles are pretty straight forward and he doesn't make any secret of them. He's an old school value investor. A lot of his money was made by buying companies that had more in assets than thier total market cap. He'd simply buy all the shares and then sell the assets. 
I think you'll find that all of Warrens Stock's have intrinsic value. The companies own buildings, factories, infrastructure etc.
@_date: 2014-02-08 19:30:30
I'm assuming you mean doge. But I thought dogecoiners don't care about making money? Besides, personally I would say the biggest, and therefore the one with the most existing network effect, is the most likely to continue to grow.

It's because many believe that alts that don't contribute anything technically only serve to discredit and weaken the crypto message. Esp. when you're talking about one that was designed specifically as a joke as we're busy trying to be taken seriously by people who do not consider their finances to be a 'joke'.
I don't necessarily agree with this sentiment but that's where I think a lot of it comes from. 
The thought is that alts like Doge threaten the success of cryptos in general. 'United we stand divided we fall'. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:53:03
Me 3
@_date: 2014-04-04 09:17:25
Yes, me too. I don't think you understand how it works. Have you looked at what the rate of inflation actually is and how it compares with that of bitcoin? This time next year dogecoin will be inflating more slowly than bitcoin. 
Once bitcoin has halved a few more times then yes, doge will again be inflating more quickly than bitcoin. By that time however the rate of inflation will be so low that it might as well be zero anyway.
However the fact remains that the inflation of doge STILL tends towards zero in just the same way that bitcoin does. Doge will never actually reach zero however for all practicable purposes it will be zero. 
This is because the inflation that was left in doge (not added, it was a mistake that was left there on purpose) is a constant amount of inflation in numerical terms, not percentage terms. 
If you take any number and add any other constant number to it then the rate of increase tends towards zero over time. eg. Take 100, add 10 to it every 10s seconds. Eventually you're adding 10 to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. The percentage change is zero of all practical purposes. This is a common misconception about doge that not many people (esp. shibes) don't seem to understand.

Ok yeah I may be coming across as that way. I don't have a problem with what dogecoin has done and I think it's definitely a positive for cryptos overall. 
And yes, doge has done well with it's marketing and full credit to all of the creative people who have made that happen.
I just don't think that days in existence is relevant because the landscape during the first two months of each coin's existence was very different and they are all so interdependent.

@_date: 2014-03-14 22:11:48
No. Which is exactly why Buffett was never at any point invested in any of those three. I never said all stocks had intrinsic value, I said the ones he invests in do. To quote a recent article I read:
"Buffett became one of the richest men on Earth by practicing a fundamentals-based "value investing" technique that is far from the freewheeling style that held sway at Enron."
@_date: 2014-02-08 19:17:32
Hmm, I don't know. I think it's a combination of both. The major reason for the run up in November was because of the Chinese using bitcoin to move their wealth out of China which is otherwise very difficult for them. I would say that it's value comes from it's utility at that point.
Bitcoin's nature doesn't rely on people speculating on it's future value. People in China would still be able to do this regardless of the price.

It's questionable as to whether it's true, at best. Regardless, it's like people are just hungry for any scrap of good news and will up-vote anything that reinforces their viewpoint. It comes across as incredibly desperate. 
If bitcoin really offers a better alternative to the existing, proprietary, closed system, which I believe it does, then we don't need to keep telling ourselves and anyone who will listen that it's better. 
The chill out and be patient. If people are able to save money by using bitcoin, they will use bitcoin. Adoption is steadily growing by every metric you can lay your hands on.

But bricks and mortar vendors don't need to wait for a confirmation. For most transactions, the cost of a double spend would be higher than the transaction value.

So bitcoin and litecoin devs and thinkers work for years developing the concept and writing and bug fixing the code and spreading the word around. Dogecoin comes along at the last minute, copies and pastes the entire codebase and puts a different name on it. When do you count the start of the existence of doge? The day the codebase was copied and renamed? Or is it still litecoin/bitcoin under a different guise?

Ok  I'm a huge fan of bitcoin and also of doing away with the idea of 'Nations'. However. In a democracy (and I don't mean the U.S., becuase the U.S. isn't a very good example of democracy) the government represents to the people. So to say that the people are fighting against the government is paradoxical because the people choose the government. 
Edit: And also 'Banks' make money because they provide valuable services to the economy. Many of which won't be replaced by bitcoin. Nobody is forced to use a bank so it's very hard to say that they are purposefully trying to keep us 'under control'. (Full disclosure - I work for a large bank)

I would say it's very, very unlikely that the banks are paying for such a service. There is so much internal auditing, regulation and risk control that I can't imagine how it would be possible. The reputational repercussions if a bank was ever uncovered doing such a thing would mean that its not worth the risk.
Besides you're kidding yourself if you think banks will dissapear because of bitcoin. Banks do a lot more than just providing current accounts. We'll still need a financial services industry.

You don't need to wait for a confirmation for 99.99% of transactions because the cost of a double spend would be so much more than the value of the transaction. Which bit don't you understand exactly?  You need to wait 10 mins before you can spend it, sure, but most merchants don't need to immediately spend their income directly after a sale. 
Lots of white, middle class, young, tech savvy American male, redditors who understand memes take it seriously. I can't imagine a lower class Indian worker in Dubai (for example) is going to see the funny side of the 'big funny dog face' when he goes to send his months wages back to his family so that they can survive for another month.

Yeah, but it's had a huge head start by taking years of hard work and development by the bitcoin and litecoin devs, copying and pasting it, and slapping a different name on. There's been very little, if any additional value added to the actual technology by dogecoin. It's like if I worked away and spent years working out how to build a spaceship, took it off towards the moon, then you came along behind me, copied my designs and took off and said "look I've only been at it for two months and I'm already on my way to the moon!".

Velocity is likely to remain relatively constant over time IMO. If the number of transactions increases then the total amount of money in circulation must also increase. For bitcoin, this means the price must increase as the number of units in circulation s fixed.
Having said that, velocity has indeed been increasing (ie. fewer people holding) as the price drops or stays flat but the number of transactions has been increasing. 
I guess when I say 'intrinsic' value, what I mean is the value that bitcoin would have if people were simply using it naturally for the transactions the wish to undertake with it rather than also speculating on future price.
People would hold an average balance and make an average number of transactions and therefore the money supply would need to be a certain size to support that. For bitcoin, this means the price would need to be at a certain value. 
At the moment the price of bitcoin is likely much above this value as people are speculating about its future growth. Very similar to a stock like Amazon or Tesla which trade way above what would be expected based on their earnings.

You're not supposed to see a dime out of bitcoin. The purpose of bitcoin is to provide a decentralised, peer to peer, method of exchange.

I believe the intrinsic value of bitcoin to be correlated to the number of people using it as well as how much they are using it. Simple velocity of money calculations apply here in my opinion (Google it).  The market price may fluctuate but what's really important to me as a supporter of bitcoin as a technology and as a long term speculator, is that bitcoin's intrinsic value continues to increase.
Mr. Market is moody and the price he demands per bitcoin seems to be only loosely related to the underlying intrinsic value per coin.

No. Scrypt has not been successfully anti-asic and I don't believe that to be necessarily benificial anyway. 
The second statement is just plain false and uninformed. For 99.99% of everyday real world transactions, zero confirmations are perfectly secure as it would cost dramatically more than the value of the transaction to perform a double spend attack. A common misconception that many people seem to hold.

I agree that the people over at dogecoin are certainly nice people. The trouble is that as soon as the currency starts to gain serious market cap it will attract all of the people who they currently dislike that are involved in bitcoin. At that point it's community and public image will change. I can assure you that not every bitcoiner is an arsehole and I think you would find that the average bitcoiner shares a lot more in common with the average dogecoiner than you would expect.

This graph gets all of the addresses for all of the transactions on any given day, filters out the duplicates and counts the reminaing number. Addresses with zero transactions on that day, but with transactions in the past are still included in the blockchain but aren't included in this graph.

Perhaps bitcoin is wildly overpriced right now? I'm not really concerned with that. I'm more worried about whether the intrinsic value is continuing to increase which it appears to be by every metric I've been able to lay my hands on.
An alternate explanation is that the intrinsic value of bitcoin is exponentially correlated to the rate of adoption as measured by this particular metric. 
@_date: 2014-09-05 13:15:32


If you make 10 transactions a day, bitcoin is more valuable than if you make one transaction per day. Unique addresses is just a proxy measurement but still a valuable one I believe.

Re. transaction numbers. The graph seems to be trending fairly steadily in an upwards direction to me? Especially if you've been keeping an eye on things since 2011 like me!
I also find that transaction numbers can be a little misleading. I think unique addresses gives a fairer representation of the adoption and usage rate:

All of the same fundamentals still apply. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:38:10
I think you are forgetting that supply = market price with bitcoin. The higher the market price, the higher the M1 and vice versa. 
The value of last resort of a dollar is zero, just as much as it is with bitcoin. I could loan you a 1btc now in return for you putting up your car as collateral, and then proceed to make exactly the same argument. 
The price volatility of bitcoin is decidedly not random. It's very closely correlated with transaction volumes, merchant adoption and regulatory news (among other things).
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:40:56
What I'm saying though, is that the reason volatility is a deterrent for some people is because there is a risk that it will go down and not come back up again. If the market was volatile but you could be guaranteed that it would return to it's current value eventually then every man and his dog would be jumping on board!!!!!
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:07:25


Please explain how I am making this assumption? I'm talking about supply in terms of value, not in terms of numeric number of bitcoins. If demand increases, numeric number of bitcoins in existence remains the same, market price increases, market supply (in value terms) increases.


I disagree that this gives them any intrinsic value. Are you saying that hyper-inflation is impossible with any currency that's legal tender? Simply untrue. As illustrated by the countless examples of hyper-inflation throughout history.


I'm going by my own experience. There have been plenty of scholarly papers released that have professed incorrect results over the years. I've not read the paper, but the fact that they weren't able to find a correlation between the price fluctuations and the data they were attempting to correlate them against doesn't imply that the the price fluctuations are random. It just implies that they're not directly correlated to any of the data they were measuring.

So what is the minimum value of a dollar then? Surely if hyper-inflation is possible, which it is, then the minimum value is so little that it's effectively zero. What happens if the country has a change of regime and a change of currency? Then how much are your dollars worth?

Well, if that's the case, then the deflationary argument is dead in the water anyway! 
But I'm not so sure. You're right, and this is something I've definitely observed myself. I don't mind spending very small amounts of bitcoin because it feels like free money to me and it's not going to make a noticeable difference to my overall holdings. However, my spending as a percentage of my total worth is very low and I'm keeping it low because I'm willing to take the risk of their value falling in return for the possibility of their value increasing. If I thought they were going to decrease in value over time however, as I do with the GBP in my bank account, then I would want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Which is what I do. I buy shares, bitcoin etc.
A business such as Overstock.com on the other hand isn't in the business of currency speculation and therefore will want to get rid of it's bitcoins as quickly as possible, either by paying suppliers or converting them into dollars. 
Edit: I've thought about this some more. I guess they key factor is what you are expecting to happen to the value of bitcoin in the **future**. For example. You may have made a lot of money on bitcoin and decide to start spending and cashing out. You would only do this however if you thought it was going to be more sensible to do this than to keep the money for the **future**.

Way to go. This is how to build the bitcoin economy!
