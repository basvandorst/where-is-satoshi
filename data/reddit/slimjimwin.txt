The clue is in the name of bitcoin, BIT is the clue :) Bitcoins can be broken into bits 8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits etc etc....so 1 bitcoin could end up being worth $10's of thousands maybe more but the bit in your pocket will be smaller say 00000000000.1 bit or whatever. So you don't need more than 21 million.

It can't be changed, even if it could there is no need because you can just divide. The amount in which you can divide a bitcoin can be changed.
