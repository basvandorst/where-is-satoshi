Localbitcoins. People that accept new Zealand bank deposit charge 300 extra per Coin than market rate not sure where else I can get cheaper

How will it become easier to mine again? Isn't complexity linked to the number of blocks already in existence? So stopping won't make it any easier? (Newbie here)

Bitcoin cash ruining cryptos tbh. They need to be shutdown 
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:33:40
So in 15 hours transactions will confirm again and we won't need crazy fees?

Ring your card company they decline it on their end thinking a scammer got your card - happened to me till I called the bank and they let it go through 
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:33:39
Send it to an exchange like poloniex and cash out

What's all this fiat stuff about 
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:42:23
At least they refunded coins right. Is electrum easy to use? I'm a noob so imperative for me is useability. Also if someone gets onto your account and then transfers your coins do you still get them back with the private key/seed or do you merely get your account back minus any btc 
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:35:02
Pure speculation lol

We are the same bank if that matters? He has over 3k trades so do you think he's probably trusted?
@_date: 2017-08-29 04:18:04
Lol you're fucked
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:05:16
Pleas explain

It wasn't in the seller terms I called him prior to the transaction and haven't entered into one yet because I wanted to check if that's normal. He said that the money could be charged back even though it's a bank deposit? I am new to local bitcoins so I have no feedback
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:56:43
How much would that be if you buy 1 btc all in one transaction 
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:33:42
Spent 2 btc back when it was 200 each 
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:54:37

Blockchain.info wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:37:45
When did they say that 
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:24:05
Coinbase is limited to basically Europe and America...not good for those outside it
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:00:42
It's very easy to use and pretty secure tbh. Any hacks resulted in refunds. If you hAve a lot of btc get a ledger but it's fine for small amounts
