But we're going to re-open, who cares if it happens again, right?

If you're sane you'd withdraw what you can first and sue for the rest afterwards. 
Wether that's successful or not is another question/discussion.

To be fair, that’s a pretty stress free way to hodl.

In my experience amazon's exchange rate is way worse than the issuing banks. 
In general never pay in your cards local currency.

The screenshot says "if the transaction is confirmed", so I'd assume no.

It's rather my reading comprehension that's lacking. I missed the "request" part of the title.

Bread seems to be us only though. At least not available in my store.

So does amazon and I assume everyone else that offers you to pay in the cards local currency.

BIP0032 also includes something called hardened keys.
They're derived from the master private key instead if the master public key. 
Hardened keys does not have this problem.

All Thai bank accepts all visa and master cards in their ATMs.
Most banks charge $6 (180thb) for withdrawal. TMB charges $5. 
Also, in the only case of skimming (wireless road) I've heard of the bank took responsibility for all money lost.

You should give them a private key derived from the master private key (or privately derived). 
BIP0032 refers to these keys as hardened keys.

You should tell your story first!
How was the wifi insecure? How did they steal the bitcoins? From your computer because C$ was shared with password "admin"? From your phone using a zero-day exploit?

If compared as numbers 10 is more than 9.  Alphabetically on the other hand. 
I do see your point if you think of the whole version as a number however. But most software have more of a major.minor versioning.

I'm pretty sure it has as finding exploitable bugs would be a great way of stealing bitcoins.
