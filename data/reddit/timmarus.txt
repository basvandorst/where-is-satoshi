Shitty argument. I don't know how my TV works, I bought it anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:18:28
My TV is an investment.
Bitcoin is an investment.
Bitcoin Cash is an investment.
What makes you think Bitcoin is an investment but a TV isn't?

I think the idea was a more "open and free" space, away from the sometimes trigger happy mods here.
If this post gets deleted and I get banned, even though I'm a staunch follower of this sub, then you'll understand why.

Just cause r/incels is banned doesn't mean you get to come here.

That's the hex I managed to get. Not sure if it's completely right, to be honest. 
That's the transaction I'm trying to cancel.

Got an error... Might be my bitcoind
Also, I get different outputs depending on if I use coinbase or bitcoind, not sure what that means...

I can't seem to figure out how to double spend it properly. There's a mess of unconfirmed transactions because of it... I've tried coinbin but I end up with a missing inputs error. Can't figure out why, I use the exact same information as the original transaction
@_date: 2017-05-06 06:13:55
Damn... Well, nothing left to do but wait, I guess. This is all very confusing. Thank you for your time and trying, at least.
What's your BTC address?
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:17:20
Oh, that must be why none of my Bitcoins are confirming...
Does that mean if I wait for the parent transaction to get dropped (after 72 hours, I believe), the rest will too?
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:36:14
Has a 492sat/byte fee I believe

About $100 USD, not much in the grand scheme of things but it's an amount I'd want back.
I'd give you the private key, but there's still some more bitcoin on there. Could you offer me advice on what you'd do?
I've tried recreating the transaction and double spending it, don't want it to confirm so waiting out isn't preferable...

To make the transaction, I've been using coinbin. My bitcoin core isn't synced yet
