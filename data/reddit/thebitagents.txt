There's a lot of interest in shirts from these designs lately, would you really want to buy? I can make that happen
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:30:56
I could probably make that happen if you'd like :D
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:07:21
yes this was done by hand, it took quite some time
I even resized a lot of them to make it appear more natural.

Hi Turil, sounds like a cool story, how did you get em? An interview with you would be cool

I know Samsung is definitely involved in crypto, they just won a contract with the Korean gov to start developing blockchain for the public sector ie welfare, medical, etc

If you guys like the quality of the memes, check out my fb page! I want Crypto/Bitcoin stuff to go mainstream!
