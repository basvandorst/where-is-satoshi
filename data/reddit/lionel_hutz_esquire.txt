This the same argument supported by those that advocated the gold standard.. 
This echo chamber seems to think that if one Fiat is bad, they are all bad..
It has the same merit as if  we said all crypto is bad because it's used by criminals

So the market digested this information. And it was only good for a 10% pop on a low volume weekend.
So you're right this is the single most bullish thing in the foreseeable future of Bitcoin

I would suggest reading some bond market commentary by an reputable and knowledgeable strategist on this subject..
the pace of maturities is being done over many years.. and the monthly maturities aren't meaningful to the US debt markets..
no one is arguing that rates won't go up as result.  it's just that it will be relatively modest in impact

Cboe application is physical.  . They are going to hold the physical Bitcoin.
Proshares application is to hold the Futures contracts.
I think the SEC is more likely to approve proshares application.
Also there will be one giant Bitcoin ETF.  And it's more likely to be proshares ETF.  Just based on their AUM
I'm referring to larger ETF providers.  That don't want to run the risk of a possible hack.   It would be easier to follow the example of most other commodity ETFs (with notable exception of GLD) that hold futures
@_date: 2018-07-12 12:50:35
I think it is very likely.   There are a lot of ETF that are pure speculative assets.    I'm too lazy to list them. But they are leveraged directional bets.   That serve no other purpose than pure gambling
So if the SEC can approve those ETF.. then this is a sure deal
Also professional investors make money off of volatility and having lots of non-professional investors in an asset.
So for them this is more opportunity to make money.

You're all in on real estate.. which is in USD.
That's your hedge against the economic collapse?   Because it worked so well in 2008...  And real estate values are completely independent of the USD, interest rates., And have no correlation to the other markets you claim are in a bubble..  And haven't run up..
Ok. I officially give up..  you broke my brain.

Here's another use case for Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-07-01 18:21:35
An ideal currency has these qualities:
Medium of exchange - simplicity, security, low over head to use, wide acceptance
Store of value - stable , low volatility, consenus of value
Bitcoin can't just be good at one of these

Then you truly are fucked
There are way better trades to protect against market collapse.  
But time is money..

why would a ETF hold actual coins? 
 if you manage ETF's, you care about 2 things, fees and AUM..
if you are only making 2 to 3% on the fund AUM. why would you take the unnecessary and uncompensated risk that your coins might get hacked?
no commodity ETF holds the actual commodity, they all own futures contracts..
