Maybe sometimes technical analysis actually works?
The Bollinger Bands had been predicting a large quick movement either up or down for two weeks. was full of people saying "any day now" and "just redrew my triangle". When it became clear it was breaking down and not up, a lot of people piled on. 
I was one of them, using 7btc on okcoin to create a 100btc leveraged short. I didn't do it because I knew there was going to be a hack, I did it because tightening Bollinger Bands in May worked perfectly too, predicting the jump from $450 to $800.
Stop seeing monsters in shadows.

What happens when the network effect begins to spread at these levels? When one multi-millionaire with ten thousand anonymous bitcoins on his Trezor talks to another? Don't these people have some existing trust relationships, so they can go to their "black market" guy, and do everything under the table instead?

I think Russia is selling gold to fund their military posturing.

"This list" refers to a whitelist of approved redditors, so it doesn't "outright remove this limitation"
