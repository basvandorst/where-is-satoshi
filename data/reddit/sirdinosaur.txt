1. 
2. have you checked out  also quite a few merchants accepting bitcoins offer discounts.
3.  if you don't mind interacting with a real person. also   and  for online purchasing.
4. if you can use the ubuntu interface without worrying about the complexities of the linux kernel, then you can use a normal wallet interface without worrying about the complexities of bitcoin.

they did just make a Wordpress plugin to begin with and see how it evolves:  the reason i called it is a "standard" is because it's a free and open protocol. i agree that it would need some road testing before it comes the defacto payment standard on the web, but from what i've seen i have high hopes.
i also think a lot of this is just too new for regular consumption, but i think there are going to be releases happening soon. i was mostly showing off where development updates and new ideas about payments on the web happen: the [public-webpayments mailing list.

i think a better question is why was it so low before the new year?
@_date: 2013-05-17 23:15:59
by making it closed-source it's a guarantee that nobody will give a shit.
@_date: 2013-02-15 01:54:34
you are awesome.

 is currency-agnostic, so if somebody makes a PaySwarm Authority that uses bitcoins it will be possible.

nothing. it is open source, secure, and simple, so if we want to make a better online wallet app then we should just need to direct our attention to the blockchain.info bounties ( which could mean funding more for new ideas.

i guess you haven't heard of [BitPay](

then good luck with anonymity. all the other cash options i can think of require you either giving up personal information, the purchase details being stored in a database somewhere, and/or you having to make the purchase on camera.

i agree that the subreddit is mostly full of bulls (i am one of them), but it seems like lately each individual bear has been posting more trying to demote the BTC price than each individual bull has been posting trying to promote the BTC price.
@_date: 2013-01-31 09:10:50
i have this question too. is there a log of all the most recent buy/sells?

can you link the email?

Coinbase accepts ACH bank transfers, so it's very convenient to exchange USD for BTC. it's also for this very reason that they delay in giving you your coins until your bank transfer completes.

 already implemented and on-screen keyboard in their wallet when entering the second password. also hardware wallets will soon solve these concerns. the point is that there exists software that is of sufficient quality where the average user need not worry, and the community is working on even better solutions that just take time.

1.  for p2p lending or  /  for using an IPO of a stock to gather funds.
2. bitcoin can only have a functioning economy if the coins are well-dispersed.

nice work! is this the same "bitcoins with friends" that was at the bitcoin hackathon? :)
@_date: 2013-01-20 23:42:28
taken from [a new post](
"One of the nice things about using PaySwarm, instead of the core Bitcoin protocol, is that the transaction is immediate. Instead of needing to wait for the transaction to be reflected in the Bitcoin blockchain, if you use PaySwarm, the Bitcoins are transferred instantly. This allows you to use Bitcoin just like you would a credit card."

Fred replied:
"I'm sorry for the trouble - our fraud algorithms have been a litte overzealous since we updated them last week. I can appreciate how frustrating that must be. I've whitelisted your account so this shouldn't occur with any transactions you make after today. Again, sorry for the trouble!
I've also sent you half a bitcoin (~$10 USD) for the trouble."
i'm still at a net loss if i were to buy coins now to replace what i sold, but given good customer service and assuming it won't happen again, i'm happy to continue using Coinbase.

they don't compete, they cooperate with bitcoin. the protocols are different ways to store and send financial information in an free and open standard on the web such that people can make secure and trusted transactions with any currency.

hi Fred, i just had one of my transactions (on 2/1) cancelled. can you help? i don't know why my order would appear high risk, i have more than enough funds and other than being 8 days away from 30 days since my first purchase, i'm fully verified.
i bought these coins to replace coins i sold on localbitcoins, so now if i were to purchase again (so i can keep the same number of total coins as before) at the current price (which is higher than what i sold the coins at), i'd have lost money. i really appreciate what coinbase offers and recommend you to anyone needing bitcoins, but this incident has me feeling at a loss, and unsure if i can trust coinbase for future transactions.

only 10.861 million coins are in existence right now, not the full 21 million. assuming the current number of coins, a 1 billion $ market cap is ~$92/btc.

quite the opposite. only with bitcoin is everyone's money and what they do with it completely public on the blockchain. sure it's pseudonymous, but statistical analysis can offer insight into finding general information and trends.

make permanent buy/sell advertisements on [localbitcoins]( meet interested customers at a local coffee shop. be friendly and make transactions over the coffee shop wifi. make sure satisfied customers rate you so that eventually you are known to the local area as a trusted bitcoin exchanger. not everything on localbitcoins needs to be sketchy, in fact all the tools available on that site allow for easy and secure local exchanges.

that's what i'm saying, it *has* been adjusted.

this is great news for any entrepreneurs in the bitcoin community. i know the people behind Boost VC personally and can vouch for them really wanting bitcoin to succeed.
my roommate and i intend to apply with an idea we have: it starts with us selling a series of hardware controllers we are designing, and ends with us making a decentralized marketplace for owners of personal manufacturing equipment (3d printers, laser cutters, cnc machines) to easily make coins producing parts based on open source designs. our entire operation will be open source (cooperation &gt; competition) and we may even be able to include bitcoin bounties for the code we need. we hope to be able to launch over the summer, assuming we don't fall off track.

btc must flow from weak hands to strong hands before higher prices can be sustained.
[what is meant by weak and strong hands?](

i'll give you a hint: you can buy now at the current price, or buy later at a higher price. notwithstanding a [force majeure]( as more people become involved in bitcoin the price of a bitcoin will continue to rise. bitcoin has gained a lot of infrastructure since the mid-2011 so i expect the price to be sustained at much higher levels before i fear it being due to a "bubble".
