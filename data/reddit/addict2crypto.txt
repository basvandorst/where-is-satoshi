Ripple will eventually be the currency used by everyone and I mean everyone. Backed by Google and the Far East banks are testing it and loving it and loving it by the time it hits the Uk banks and America. Everyone will use Ripple. I mine as well just start buying it. I don't even think it will be tradeable. It hardly is now. But they have the infrastructure built (the banks) and fiat done with. People outside the Cryptosphere won't even know how this happened. and Google prints its own money. So yeah Ripple will be the NWO and represent the only currency taken everywhere used by everyone. IOTA is the only other option that I see as widely used. IOTS and Ripple. Its just like he mentioned above it will be. Government regulated Currency. Then I can see a whole new exchange for all the Forex people that lost big time. Ripple will start representing nations. So it will be like Tehter is now but USDR, AUDR, GBPR. Not all crypto will die, but it will not be used by the masses. Satoshi Nakamoto will turn in his grave. His vision was to create a self-sustaining economy within an economy. Well, it gave Idea to a Bigger Idea. An economy ruled by rich and supported by the poor. This is what will separate the rich from the poor. No middle class. Gold will not be suppressed by the banks anymore and if you are not a billionaire in 5 years you will be a slave to the government. Pop goes the Crypto BUbble.
