This is spot on, we at vaultoro have enabled people to trade between bitcoin and allocated gold for over 4 years and it works wonderfully. No need to trust banks with their fractional reserves and little insurance. Gold is a good hedge to cryptos highs that can be fully insured by Lloyds of London and Helvetia that we use. I got into bitcoin to get away from fiat. I now price bitcoin in gold, so the real price of bitcoin is 0.0056 btc per gram or 173.35 grams per bitcoin.  :)

Yes we were building a commodities backed card and actually built all the back end for it. This would allow you to save a basket of physical and digital assetsnand spend using the card Wavecrest was the card issuer that everyone was using because they had a very sophisticated api that could enable third party balance polling. Belive it or not, they are one of the very few with this ability. When visa banned wavecrest all card issuers lost business models and clients suffered. We decided to shelve the card plans because relying on visa and banks to not just turn on us and our clients is too much risk.
For that reason we are trying to stay as bank independent as possible for now. 
Later down the track we might look at it. All the tech is built so..... You never know.

Yes! Blockstream has been working on a thing called liquid which is a private shared liquidity pool for exchanges using lightning. In the end decentralised exchanges will take over most crypto to crypto exchanges. We deal in a physical asset which needs insurance and auditing so its naturally centralised

If the network is not under heavy load, closing and reopening is almost free. So it can actually be more efficient/cheaper to do an 'ordinary lightning transaction' \(i.e. 1 off chain transaction and 2 on chain transactions\) instead of one regular on chain transaction under heavy load. You 'reserve' the payment by opening a channel with a very low fee and low priority. In theory, it helps balancing the onchain load.

u/NicolasDorier When integrating Fiat support, please consider to use the unified API from [ It would enable to forward the payment to a dedicated exchange, process instant orders with BTC that has been send \(i.e. pooled for conversion\) to the exchange before, and batch transactions before converting to fiat. It would be more flexible and faster \(no need to wait 6 confirmations\) and give access to 60\+ Bitcoin exchanges that are supported by XChange.

Hey, thanks for your passion. We have never given any resources or money to this fund and didn't think its intention was to fire core.
I (Josh) looked at every side of the scaling debate. It is important to look at every scaling solution. Research the crap out of every idea. We quickly realised that layer two makes the most sense. 
I think a little bit of a block increase wouldn't have hurt and given a bit more runway in the short term for lightning devs but yeah it became clear fast that segwit and lightning were a better long term solution. Then when Bcash forked i was happy because we as a community dislodged this stalemate. Bcash could try theirs and core theirs and all users got to hold both and choose. Great. I am very disappointed about this brand confusion game Ver and bitcoin dot com is playing at. It's very unfortunate and bad sportsmanship. Anyway lightning is here! Lets get back to building cool shit and making the central banks and debt based fiat systems the enemy.

We are building vaultoro 2.0 at the moment to offer new pairs like silver and some other crypto pairs. Also working on a maker-taker fee model, so market makers pay less. Takers have real-time order book trading without trusting our hot wallet but pay a little for it. We have to build our end out first to make this work, and once we have that done, we could definitely contribute. It's significant sharing resources when possible. The cool thing is it's exciting and fun for engineers to work on this revolutionary technology from all ends.

We deal in allocated gold not unallocated. If a government would like to confiscate your metal they would need an international subpeana submitted to the Swiss Authorities, who would then have to go through a long and areduase legal process before they would be legely aloud to confiscate anything from you. The Swiss have had a long history of securing private assets.
Now. Because it's allocated gold, they could only go after single accounts and not everyones at once.
EU Data protection laws also make the process of finding out who has accounts very hard. We are also bank independent so dont have any of the few new reporting obligations Swiss Banks have.

Thanks you, the answer is ~3 Months. We could have just duplicated the code and stuffed another pair in but over the last 3 months have been building the exchange from the ground up to allow more commodity pairs. (Doing it properly) We will be able to compete with the largest commodities exchanges in the world in both speed and hopefully volume. Goal would be to have a full crypto commodities exchange as to move the 20 billion dollar markets away from flat and settle as much as possible in crypto.

They can with lightning :) as you will not have to trust our hot wallet. You will be able to pluck orders from the order book direct from your lightning wallet. Market makers will still need to trust our hot wallets but will soon get rewarded with less fees as maker. We have been online for 3.5 years without incident. 
But yeah the goal is less and less trust required. At this stage we have focused on transparency, building the glass books protocol to have full proof of reserves. And Vaultoro's gold is not tokenised, its fully allocated gold, audited by BDO international and insured. So as little trust is needed as possible for the type of assets our clients trade in. Currently, Physical gold and Bitcoin.

Why do we put up with them and say we should be careful what we say about them. Nope, fuck em, especially central banks. But yeah I'm always surprised how scared people are at the term fuck banks.

Welcome to the peaceful revolution of money. Everything you know about money if probably wrong.
The Australian dollars in your pocket is created as debt. That means if you have 20 dollars in your pocket, someone owes 20 to a bank plus interest. There is literally not enough money circulating to pay all the interest of getting all the money into circulation (Usually through mortgages). This means there will always be people in extreme poverty due to there not being enough money. Kind of like musical chairs. Not enough chairs for everyone to sit.
Bitcoin like gold is found into existence and spent. Gold is a rare metal and Bitcoin a rare number. A gold miner would go out, find some gold and spend it into circulation. This is the same as Bitcoin. Miners find rare numbers, and spend them into existence without debt, without interest.
But you don't have to know all this to enjoy Bitcoin as a borderless and permissionless native currency of the internet.

We have been the only orderbook exchange to trade bitcoin with allocated gold since Feb 2015. 
All gold is secured in the second largest vaulting facility in Switzerland (pro aurum), is fully audited by BDO international and fully insured.
You can trade back to bitcoin is seconds, keep it in gold or get physical sent out. 
Keep in mind we where not set up to send out physical, rather an easy way to hedge into a physical asse that is owned by the user and not by the exchange which is the case with Fiat exchanges.) 
We do deliver physical because it's your property secured in your name so you can naturally have it delivered but it's not the cheapest way to get gold you can cuddle at home.
We also pioneers the glass books protocol so you can always check for full reserves with a grandma friendly live audit.

Think of a bar tab where you load the tab with the bartender at the start of the night using bitcoin and at the end of the night you take whatever you didn't spend. 
Now imagine that you can also pay anyone else in that bar that has open tabs, through the bar man. 
Now imagine if anyone in that bar has tabs open with other bars around town. You can pay anyone in any of the bars through the bar man, through the customer in that bar and any number of hops.
All with real bitcoin, all instantly with hundreds of thousands of transactions a second. 
  freedom and usefulness.
EDIT: You don't have to have a tab open with the Bar, you can also have a channel open with anyone else in the bar and pay the bar man for drinks.

This is what we have offered the bitcoin space since 2015. Vaultoro traders have traded over 2.5 tons of gold and bitcoin in that time. Why trade into gold and not fiat? Gold is secured in your name as your legal property, that means if anything ever happens to vaultoro even liquidators cant touch our clients assets. This is unlike every fiat exchange. All bullion is fully audited by BDO and fully insured. We also pioneered the glass books protocol so users can always audit the exchange.
Gold is a great way to hedge or take profit off the table because it shares so many aspects of bitcoin. Private, bank independant, found and spent into existence, rare, divisible, decentralized in its discovery. I've never understood why Peter Schiff sees bitcoin as the enemy.  Fiat and fractional reserve banking is what we should be fighting.

If you have an apartment in a building, you have a lock on your door. That door is like a public address. People can put notes (bitcoin) under the door but not open the door. That door (public key) has a private key that is owned by you and  the only one that can open the door. 
Once you open the door, everyone in the building can see that you have opened the door and they can verify that and watch you take the note the was pushed under your door (the bitcoin) and watch you push it under someone elses door (send the bitcoin to someone else)

On android there is a good app called mycelium. Its a bitcoin wallet with a local market place in it. (Go to balance, buy/sell bitcoin) The market place uses GPS to show you other people in your area that have cash and want to buy btc or people that have BTC and want to buy cash with it. This means you can get paid in bitcoin for your thing and then find a buyer for your bitcoin locally. 
Think of bitcoin as a rare digital asset that you can't copy and people find it valuable (people speculate on the value of it). Other digital assets like Mp3, pdf, jpg you can copy but bitcoin is a type of digital asset that you can't copy. All you can do is send it to an address that someone else controls and you can never get back once sent without the new person that you sent it to sending it back to you.
2 concepts.
Public address or (key)
Private key 
Think of public addresses like a really well-secured letter box. People can only put bitcoin into that address.
Private key controls that public address. So a private key lets you and only you open that letterbox and send what's inside (an amount of bitcoin) to another address.
Thats why private keys are private. You have to keep them well secured. This is what wallet software like myceluim or many others do. Wallets don't actually store bitcoin. Wallets store your private keys. Your bitcoin are stored on a shared  list held by every one on the internet  that runs a bitcoin full node. But those nodes don't have the private key to send your bitcoin so they are safe. You can also run your own full node if you would like to learn. But for a 4 year old it's not recommended due to complexity. ;)
So now you understand that there is no central database where your balance is stored. The system is decentralised. Thats why governments can't stop it. 
Your android or iOS wallet takes care of everything. So it's easy for the normal person.
You can use bitcoin as money or as currency. Money means you accept bitcoin and then spend it as bitcoin. This is ideal but bitcoin is notoriously volatile relative to USD, Euro or gold. Many use it as a currency only. Meaning they accept it and instantly convert it to something more stable like gold using vaultoro (shameless plug) where they can then sell the gold back for bitcoin when they want to spend it again. People also convert the bitcoin they receive directly to fiat  (government money).
But you don't have to. You can simply receive bitcoin as payment a spend it again with someone else that accepts it as payment.
@_date: 2019-09-08 02:37:22
In Mycelium there is a built in local market place where you find people near you that want to buy and sell.  Its strange that more people don't know about it.
Tip. Always meet strangers in a bank lobby to do the trade. If banks are good for one thing, it's security in the lobby. If not a bank then a starbuck or something really public.
To find local market place, go into mycelium, on the bottom of the balance page there is a button that says buy / sell bitcoin. It will show people near you and what price there are willing to sell.
 (This is not advice, just educational)

One that really stood out was an old woman who had worked her whole life to save for an apartment on the island. She finally purchased one and lived in it for 15 years or so. The money in that apartment was her retirement savings and so when she retired she sold it for 600k, this was her life savings to live on for the rest of her life.
She put that into a Cyprus bank. It was in there for 6 months, and then one day on Friday it was there and Monday it was all gone. National insurance put 100k back in but the rest was gone and she had to live on that for the rest of her life. Very sad story. I asked if her story was abnormal, nope everyone lost everything apart from 100k. Unless you were super rich then you got warnings beforehand and could move it out.
Nowadays I give talks about many things at conferences (busting lighting network fud is my fav) but transparency in exchanges has almost taken second place to transparency in banks because of the stories like this older womens story.

Broadcasting a 1 meg file to every node in the network takes time. Actually if you try to change your DNS record it can take up to 24 hours to broadcast around the web.

People use us (vaultoro) because they know what time it is. The media always try to pit gold and bitcoin against each other, but the fact is fiat is the enemy.  Rare metals and rare numbers are asset-based money. Fiat is debt based currency crap.

There are enormous benefits. We at  were the first order book exchange in the world to implement lightning this time last year and it enables a few cool things.
Instantly take an order from the order book without trusting our hot wallet.
This works by setting an instant order in your settings.
Another benefit is that arbitrage ops become a lot faster to resolve, pegging different markets.

What a stupid campaign. The real competition is fiat, not gold.  FacePalm

Peter Vessenes is a fraud, opportunistic cancer on crypto. The foundation had good intentions and I was a founding lifetime member but soon realised that a centralised foundation is corruptible.

It's efficient vs other miners. Efficiency as a whole does not exist anywhere. It is always relative to something else.

Bitcoin is innovating.
Some loud voices wanted to stick with just bigger blocks but the core devs pushed on with innovating Segwit so we could have an upgradeable scripting language, more space, the ability to add schnotr sigs using a soft fork rather than hard as well as smart contract based transactions (lightning network).
Also, pandora's box is open, Facebook will have a coin, Amazon will and millions of alts.
But bitcoin was the first.
If nothing else, that makes it collectable and there are only 21 mil to collect.
Can you say that you have 1 piece of the very first cryptocurrency? You have a small piece of history?
