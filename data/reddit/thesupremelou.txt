Yeah, but your ability to sell magazines largely depends on you delivering the truth.  I agree that there has been some gap between objective truth and selling subscriptions, but you aren't going to buy a newspaper who has a journalist that keeps getting caught lying.  I agree that he should sue if it is causing him undue stress and hardship.  I was just pointing out that it is often hard to admit you were wrong when your job depends on you being right all of the time.

Was that pun intentional?  Also, it's often hard for people to admit they were wrong when it's their job to deliver the truth.  Not justifying her response; just helping to understand what she's doing now.

Way to be an ass. I also live and trade here. I just didn't know all of that stuff. You could have been a nice person and clarified, turning this into a teaching moment, but instead you decided to be a pompous cunt. No wonder people are hesitant to invest I bitcoin.

Right on Bui Vien too. The best drunk decision you can make there.

Kind of. Technically not approved by the government but they tend to ignore things they don't understand. Plus, they give westerners some leeway especially around this street. It's where all the drugs and late night drinking are. It's a grey area though because it is illegal but there's also a bitcoin atm in the city too.

Yeah I agree it's been a useful financial tool while I'm here. Whether it's for saving or moving small amounts between my international accounts. I wasn't trying to spread misinformation; it was just the last information I got (from Tuoi Tre News probably not the best source for news about bitcoin). I think we need to try to be the change we want to see on this sub. I know a lot of people are stubbornly ignorant, but there's a lot of people that want to learn too.

It's also a lot more to transfer funds from a bank here anyway. Sometimes 20%
