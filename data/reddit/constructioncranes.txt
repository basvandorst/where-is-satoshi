I'm with you re people here needing to cool their jets and realize they can lose a lot of money overnight but I think as more retail providers accept bitcoin, it will be as easy to use for general consumer spending as cash. The only issue I see with it currently is the extreme volatility - I actually wonder how current businesses that take btc price items when the value of btc changes 5-10% daily.

Cheers. So it seems bitcointalk discussions have degenerated along with most crypto subreddits. Do you know where one could go for truly authentic and sincere alt coin discussions?

dude, he welcomes opposing arguments and wanted an educated debate. You provided a paragraph to that end and we all benefited from it. Did you really need to then attack him? Come on you're better than that.

I thought it's more that most people think the days of making ten or twenty times their investment on bitcoin are over whereas if they find that one magical *right* altcoin, they'll turn their 42 bucks into 10K.

I've just started reading a lot of bitcointalk to expand my knowledge but I swear, most users in there sound like teenagers from non-English speaking countries. Not that I have anything against that, but is that accurate or is there some kind of inside joke language used on the site?

Sigh... I don't understand the alt coin hate. Lots of people have made lots of money, including me. And that's from purely riding the speculation and hype. There will be other dominant coins beyond BTC so why not try to educate ourselves about them?

Hey, I dabble in stocks for fun and have had pretty good gains with my complete amateur approach so far. I came across this halvening and am trying to read up on it. 
The phenomenon you're describing has been a big factor in my returns. I know some things are hype, but that hype does affect stock price so I play with that info.
Now, you're suggesting the halvening will cause an increase in price as a bunch of people (like me) will buy on hype, raising the price. Then the actual market effect of the halvening will take shape months after. Wouldn't it be smart then, for me to buy some BTCs right now? Since it seems the hype and the halvening will both raise the price? 
@_date: 2016-07-08 15:44:24
Right, but that does mean I should buy right now either way, as the price is only going up. There might be a short amount of time where it drops again after the hype dump causes short downward pressure.

But I guess you'd get a second chance if you miss the hype dump, you could dump when the price goes up from the actual halvening effect?
