You can not want the people to have savings in the bank so the banks make loans on FRB (to encourage economic activity) and at the same time not have the money in the bank but in the stocks (to encourage economic activity).
The more money there is in the bank the more the banks would be capable to make loans (and cheaper!) even without FRB. It is savings that encourage investment. You have excess produced by the economy that is finding its way to become productive. That is what encourages true and healthy economic growth.
What you describe is excessive exposure to risk which encourages reckless gambling / speculation.
Just think about your magic number 2%. Would it not be even more encouraging not to save if it were 20%. Hell, why not 70%?
Would you loan me your money at 1%? I am sure not, so who would? Only those whom cost it less than that... those who can create it out of thin air. You are proposing a vicious circle. You do realize this is an exponential function and will at some point run away from reality?

Seems like this is not the investment you should have made. You've made an entry into the market, and you should know your exit. If your exit is to spend coins once they are highly valued, just keep on waiting. Remember, you still own 28 out of 21m, nothing has changed from that perspective. 
Also, I am sure people here told you not to invest money you couldn't afford to lose.

Let's forget labels for a moment. I like that you have noble goals, and I believe those are not too different from many other individuals here. What I do have a problem with is the means you are willing to use to achieve the goals (putting aside the discussion if those are actually achievable through those means).
You contradict your self when you say you are freedom advocate (where prerequisite is an individual and individual freedoms), yet at the same time believe in collectivist approach to solving social problems - i.e. single payer health care, progressive taxes and mandated unions - which come at the expense of limiting individual freedoms.
So which is it? Individual freedoms, individual choices and individual sacrifices (voluntary actions), or collective decision making (central planning) and a collective sacrificing an individual (even against his/her will)? This, unfortunately, is a line that distinguishes if you indeed are one or the other. I am inclined to think you are (given your noble goals) really a freedom activist, just have not realized that forcing your ideas onto others (collectivist) does not make it right, nor better in the long run.
I am sure you would not like me to force my ideas on you. Do not do the same to others.
Your grandma was right - "it takes all kinds", do not try to eliminate them. The variety is a necessity. It is only possible with freedom for each and every individual. The opposite is mediocrity.

The true seed for the HD wallet is derived from the seed and the passphrase. Using a different passphrase = different HD wallet (fully functional).
To recover a passphrase protected wallet, one needs the seed and the passphrase.
Note the seed is protected by never touching a connected device (assuming you do store it on paper only or in some other well protected form). The passphrase on the other hand is only as protected as the device where you enter it. So I would say the seed is the secure part of your wallet, whereas the passphrase adds extra protection, but is in itself weaker because it is easier to compromise. However, compromising the seed or the passphrase only is not sufficient, one needs both. ...and there could be multiple passphrases to gain access to the multiple wallets.

@_date: 2014-07-27 12:04:03
Yes indeed. Some Austrians (namely Rothbard) do suggest banks should have all reserves at all times to completely prevent this distortion to money availability. It would definitely prevent bank runs.
The scale of total available credit possible under these conditions is in orders of magnitude smaller than it is under current FRB conditions though.
I do agree blockchain can improve the oversight. Regulation? Nope.

He said something would have to happen to the dollar first. Then Bitcoin could be an alternative for people to flee to. Not the other way around. It could help bring the dollar down in the sense of an alternative (in this case Bitcoin) being available, thus making it more difficult (or impossible) to save the dollar through monetary meddling.
It needs to be said though he knows very well that that "something" actually is happening to the dollar for quite some time now, and historically it is actually inevitable (ever since decoupled from gold, having no restriction to printing).

@_date: 2014-07-28 09:32:33
Nope, you are confusing inflation. New technology is created to REDUCE the amount of resource / effort needed to produce. Thus to decrease the price.
The decreased amount of resource / effort required enables increased production / productivity if demanded. The balance between the increased demand by the increase in population and increased supply may be such
a) price stays same, because increase in population and decrease in needed resource / effort are same
b) price increases, the increase in population is greater and increase in productivity is not sufficient to cover it
c) most common in the long run - price decreases, because the advancement in production is greater than population growth / demand and consequently more resources become available for other purposes. There is now more excess capital (in the form of resource, available labor as well as savings - from the decreased prices) that enables new form of economic activity, new investments.
There is no need to inflate the money supply to encourage this process. In fact, the opposite is true - to enable true reading and measurement of results of all mentioned activities. That enables all participating individuals to make correct economic decisions more often.

If he had sold (fractional reserve) coins he did not have as you suggest, the price would drop like a rock on 650k coins, even if done over a longer term, unless the demand would be so high. In such case the price could still be rising but it would be suppressed by the additional fictional 650k supply. And it would skyrocket after he would be done selling these fictional coins (which would be after gox closed doors). Current price disproves this course of action.

It sure does. The dynamic changes a little, because showing a purchase order for large amount of coins on the exchanges order books has immediate psychological effect. OTC is immune to that. But absorbing such large amounts of supply certainly has big impact on price. The case just may be, that the downward pressures are much larger than this upward pressure - and the price may still slide down.

If it is not payable on demand, you can not transfer it without a penalty.
But I completely agree with your assessment - the problem would not reach such proportions if it weren't for a central bank and legal tender laws. The central bank is the top of the pyramid. With freedom from that we can have banks printing their own bank notes, and I would really like to see how many of those proposing 2% inflation would choose banks with such notes over no inflation. Oh, we might well see that in the cryptocurrencies world.
Though, there were times when central bank did not exist in the US and yet the fractional reserve did cause issues (of much smaller scale than we have now, granted). Another power came for rescue: even without legal tender laws the state gave the banks the privilege to (temporarily) not have to redeem bank notes for species. Not a small intervention, setting up conditions to enable more deception and fraud.

Idle savings encourage investment. Savings can be deployed and become capital, unlike credit, which is simply a gamble.
If you start with the presumption that this conversation will go nowhere, it's hard to have one. Than you say it's really simple (which I agree with, only common sense is needed), but not provide more than a differently formulated same assertion.
Not only does history prove you wrong on that assertion (by providing examples of huge growth with no inflation whatsoever) but also backed up by economic theory founded on reasoning. To prove your point you would have to falsify it first.
Inflation does not encourage investment, it encourages speculation. Nobody wants to be the bag holder. It passes around like a hot potato, which you call economic activity. But that is equivalent to rotten economic activity, motivating people to find other means of preserving their wealth instead of producing wealth.
Let me ask you a question. How much effort have you actually spent education yourself on these matters? If you have dedicated reasonable time doing so, have you also look at alternative explanations to the ones you hold yourself and their reasoning? I am sincerely interested, given that you like to put these views forth as facts. Just so I could respect you for trying to understand.

So when a man is born, do new resources spring into existence? If not, currency should not either.
In fact, the more people there is, the more demand for the resources - the greater pressure to economize with them. So the initial increase in demand (and reflecting increase in price) can be offset by technological improvement. That is what drives it, not inflation. Inflation simply makes the resources more expensive in terms of the given currency, in addition to skimming the value from the whole population using it. It is not received by the newborns, is it?
@_date: 2014-06-26 10:49:10
A free individual is not restricted to take part in a group, under the condition the individuals in the group do not mind. However, I would say the structure you are describing is characterized by community, rather then collective. A community allows individuals to enter and leave. It is hard to escape a collective, as it feels entitled to take what it desires (the involuntary sacrifice). 
@_date: 2014-07-27 11:53:50
It is the other way around. Credit creation out of nothing allows for bad loans to happen at a greater scale. Making said loan and not being exposed to consequence (it cost you nothing to make it) is the driver here.
You have to remember that the money loaned enter the economy even if it happens to be a bad loan. It does not disappear by the loan turning into a bad one. And so the credit bubbles up. It is the good loans that annihilate the created credit once paid back.

No, they could do so with customer money as long as those have been associated with product not payable on demand (timed deposits, e.g. savings accounts). You would have 100% reserve for "demand deposits", e.g. checking account.

It encourages spending primarily by the receivers of the newly created currency. But that does not equal wealth. The value of the newly created currency comes from the rest of the money in existence.
You seem to be deliberately using term currency instead of money, is this the case?
Because one of the fundamental ideas of money (in I would argue in extension currency too) is for it to be store of value.
If you think the inflation does not hurt poor people, think again. Inflation does not only devalue the money they happen to hold, but all the money they will hold in the future. All their future salary is devalued. Some of it (but not all!) is offset by salary increase due to inflation adjustment, but that is based on CPI, which is deliberately created for this purpose. To make them believe they are not hurt.
If you wish to assert that inflation is good (even if limited to steady) you need to state a case and prove it.

No, it will simply make the true price visible. Unlike now, when it is distorted and the cost is covered through other convoluted means (including inflation and all other undesired effects). This will allow an individual for better planning and decision making. And there will be less room for speculation, which in turn will bring actual asset price levels down to accessible level again. The increase in cost of money will be very well offset by this drop.

Very well said. I would add that the bitcoin inflation where miners are the first receivers of the newly mined bitcoins is quite different to paper money printing. It costs miners very close to the current market value, unlike printing paper at ridiculously low cost to the central bank (and mostly they don't even print it). I prefer the comparison to gold mining, which under gold standard represents inflation too.

I just have. You have to specify a mobile phone number, as that's where the ticket is delivered via SMS (ticket validity is tied to that number - by design of the city transportation service, not bitbrno). They use bitcoinpay.com as payment gateway, it takes up to 2 minutes to receive the ticket, in my case it took roughly that much time. It's not dissimilar to the mobile message payment method - but you pay not by sending a message to a premium number (which is added onto your mobile plan invoice) but by sending btc. It's quite nicely done, actually.
