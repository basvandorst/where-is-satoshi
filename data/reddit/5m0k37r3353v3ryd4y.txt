Does anyone know what we’re supposed to do to get our digital currency back?! 
Did the U.S. government rob me?!

No, I appreciated this answer and the link! As a newbie, it was a more technical explanation than what I've read before, and I do want to learn more about it. This was an excellent response and I might just learn something interesting about bitcoin and cryptography! 
fas2: That is the kind of answer newbies are looking for if they want to learn and get better and be less newbie-ish.

Thanks for my first change-tip!

Thanks! I dare say this post has been one of the nicest interactions I've had on Reddit.

So the callback URL provided would be, like, a mailto:emailaddress.com or like mybusiness.com or something different?
Wait, I think I got it, so a web developer would have a page on their website where it would just process these incoming pings from coinbase about a transaction that just occurred so that it could email a receipt or whatever?
I may not know enough about HTML or web development to get this... but I am trying to understand it all.
Thanks for being patient and helpful!

Interesting, thank you. I was having trouble finding these 'private keys' everyone's been talking about, and you're right, it's because Coinbase won't show them to me. I did notice they have a paper wallet option, where it seems they do give you the private key with your BTC when you print out your wallet. Is that the gist of cold storage?
I'll check out those bitzuma links. "a gentle introduction" hah I like it. People want to get into bitcoin without having to take programming 101, gentle introductions are perfect.

Very weird and very cool! I'm not sure I understood it all but the main ideas behind it are fascinating. thank you very much for explaining that!
