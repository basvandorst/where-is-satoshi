Nope, you read that exactly correct.  The scariest part of the story was this:  I have a friend who like religiously depises credit cards, but he makes great money etc.   So I bought him an item off Ebay for $2100.  That morning he gave me the cash to pay the CC bill then.  So when they pulled me over, I had that money on me.  Now, thankfully they didn't ask where I got it from when I shared my job title, as it basically showed I had a job that paid well enough to have that kind of cash on me (and I never carry cash, at all, if I got $5 on me its almost a suprrise).  So, I was freaking out they were going to confiscate it for civil forfeit just cause.  They didn't, instead, they gave it back to me, and put me in a holding cell with about 10-15 guys that were coming from the jail they transferred me to (where I paid $100 for my 4-6 hour stay).  These guys of course were complaining they didn't have money to pay fines, etc etc, and here I am, a goddamn cash pinanta.  I was freaking out.  Because I'm not the kind of person that has ever had run ins, I'm almost 40, and this was the first time I'd ever seen the inside of a jail / holding cell.  
So yeah, the end result was that though, had to pay for the ability to sit there for a few hours.

When you pay taxes in the U.S. its done in two ways. 
1.) By payroll deduction (typical of W-2 employees, which most people fall under)
2.) By payment either quarterly or yearly (1099 employees / contractors).  
I was a W-2 employee, the taxes were taken out of my check weekly for the necessary income.  But the form that needed to be filed, wasn't (probably my fault, but it was a new city to me and I never had to file city tax returns before, so I wasn't aware, they gave you no notification when you moved into the area).  
So, there's the jist of it.  Basically the money was paid, nothing was owed, but because there was no tax form they could reference, they came after me for "assumed" debt, there was none.

The side is the state.  I don't know about you, but I don't think I have more money than the government, and if I did, they'd just take it, and probably use it to further my suffering anyway.

The rest of us call those SuperPAC's, I suppose you can label them otherwise

I sat in jail for a day because I owed $0 in taxes.
So, soak that one up for a second.  
That $0 tax bill has cost me about $1500 to pay and defend against. 
The system works perfect.  I'm sure this new law will have no negative effects on anyone, clearly they're doing a bang up fucking job with the ones they already have on the books, whats another pound of flesh.

Yeah...we don't like that one either.  Just wait, we're trying to fix  (almost done),  (Ugh, difficult, goddamn rednecks) and then we'll get  done because nobody can defend themselves anymore.  - Every politician that consumes oxygen

I paid the taxes when they were due x # of years ago (8-10 years I think), but because the form was not there.  They issued a warrant.  I had to pay for my car to be impounded ($125 + $8 a day) an attorney ($750), the 4 hours I spent in the jail (I also spent another 12 hours in another jail before they transferred me) ($100), bonding myself out ($275), and I have to now go to court and pay them ($125) for the ability to step in the 2 doors and say I owe $0. 
I also lost a day of work ($200-300) for this. 
Welcome to the legal system, all that, for $0.
