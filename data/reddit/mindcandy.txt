I had serious concerned about hub centralization in LN until I listened to [Andreas talk about it this week.](
My concern was that when random people are presented with a new, confusing option that is difficult to estimate the value of, they largely just follow the herd and do whatever is most popular.  Bonus if it actually is a bit cheaper and more convenient.   Mining pool centralization is a good example of this.  Thus the popular option gets more popular in a feedback loop as all the new people say to themselves "Everyone else is doing it.  It must be the smart choice!". 
Apparently LN's counter to this is [The Power of Defaults.](  That is, when random people are presented with a complex option, but a default has been chosen for them, they largely stick with the default.  In the case of LN, choosing who to open channels with is a complex option that in reality is better left to an algorithm.  So, that's the default.  You can manually open channels with whomever you want.  But, the default for the masses is to let the code open channels for you that are picked specifically to decentralize the mesh while getting what you want done.

That said, at the moment I think all connections are manual and we are already seeing some hubs form in   SLEEPYARK is an obvious one.  It would be nice if we didn't start out the main net LN with a ring of hubs.
Here's a proposal.  (I'd love to hear better ones)
If you are going to be brave enough to play with alpha LN on main net, try to be a good citizen.  Instead of linking directly to big hubs, pick a few smaller hubs that each put you one hop from one the big ones.  By doing that, you become a small hub!  Open a few small channels.  Use low fees. [11 sat/byte (~$0.30) should be fine right now.](   There's no rush here.
edit: 11 sat/byte, not even 21!

Would it be feasible to run an app on my phone that checks for cheaters once/day?  
My phone is locally controlled, trusted machine that is connected practically 24/7 regardless of what I'm doing.  If running a check is a small amount of work and network traffic, it should be feasible to run as a background app.  It's possible that my phone could be taken offline for a week, but for that exceptional case I would have plenty of warning that I need to run a checker via some other means.

The guy who wrote the book behind *The Social Network* movie is writing a new book about the twins and bitcoin.  In talking about it he's pretty frank about how he thinks he pre-judged the twins by their extremely punchable faces.  Now his opinion is that they aren't angels, but they aren't as horrible as he portrayed them to be.
Meanwhile, he learned later about Zuck pulling shit like opening an account on the twins' social site under one of their names and then trolling as if that one was a publicly racists asshole.

We’re talking about the same thing in different ways.  My understanding of the requirements matches yours. AFAIK, you can summarize your trades as long as you break them down by coin, exchange and long vs. short term holdings.  But, in order to summarize you need to keep records of what coin’s profit went to what coin/other purchase. That makes every event taxable in my head. Even if they aren’t detailed individually in your report to the IRS, they need to be in your own records. And, it’s a good idea for them to be in case you need to argue with the IRS eventually.

They both had the same pluses and minuses in the style points category.  They both get credit in the beginning for taking turns, letting the other guy complete his thought, not getting stuck on one topic, etc...  But, on the other hand they both had very weak arguments all around.  A lot of gotcha/technicality questions and a lot of soundbite/technicality answers.
In the end, what set off Ver was the mention of  which is Ver's literal pay-for-shills platform that is literally attached to bitcoin.com.   That he could create [a platform for paying shills]( and then get triggered by the idea that he pays shills is beyond me.
Edit: And, I do agree.  The interviewer went full-on troll mode at the end.  Not many people have the composure to laugh off that kind of antagonism.  Ver better get practicing if we wants to lead a revolution.

The big problem with this article is that it is measuring an unspecified future using today's prices.  OTOH, [storage prices have been flattening out aroun 2c/GB,]( similarly with [home internet bandwidth around $1/GB/s,]( and [RAM prices have been flat for about 4 years]( though they [may resume downward in 2019.](  Anyone have a more recent version of this [cloud bandwidth price chart?](

You can work around that requirement by not selecting your bank and instead going with the generic option for non-listed banks.
It works by giving them the bank routing number and account number that's on all of your checks.  Coinbase will make two tiny deposits into your checking account.  Then you go back and tell them the deposit amounts.  That verifies that you control the account without giving them access to your friggin bank password.
It takes longer.  You might have to wait several days for the deposits to go through.  But, it's way, way preferable.

There was a time, in the distant past, through rose-colored glasses, when journalists and guests asked each other very difficult questions in the spirit of friendly but hearty debate rather than in a sneaky attempt to trip up an opponent on trickily-worded technicalities.

I'm still figuring this out.  So, I'm quite open to corrections.
My understanding is that node relay signed blocks throughout the network.  But, they verify that those blocks are were processed correctly before they relay them.  Let's say, hypothetically, running a non-mining node gets too expensive and the only full nodes remaining are mostly miners + a few corporations.  In that situation, let's suppose a large group of miners decided to collude to set the block reward back up to 50 BTC/block for a year and they all agree to validate and relay each other's blocks even thought they are cheating.  In that situation, non-colluding nodes will refuse to relay those blocks and we'll effectively have a chain fork.
Having lots of nodes in general deters this strategy.  More decentralized mining would prevent even more attack vectors, but the security added by non-mining nodes should not be disregarded on the grounds that it doesn't protect from everything all by itself.
I'm not aware of anything segwit did to change this situation.

The math on storage size is a bit off because you start with an annual transaction rate, break that down to a daily storage cost, then bring it back as an annual storage cost.  
If you go straight from annual rate -&gt; annual cost: 522 billion * 250 bytes / 1 trillion = 130.5 terabytes

What you’ve been told is a straw man version of how Lightning works.  It’s based on Step 1 and 2 of how it works. Step 1: Open a channel with another party. Step 2: Repeat Step 1 a few times.
But, it critically ignores Step 3:  There is no Step 3. By Step 3 you are already connected to the entire network. If you want to transact with some random vendor on the network that you’ve never heard of until just now, there might be a few hops between you and them, but the fee to cross those hops is trivial.
Edit:  There is an major flaw in Step 1&amp;2 that makes the system untenable. But, the good news is that the flaw is so obvious that, yes, the designers have thought about it and have a solution.  The flaw is that when choosing who to open channels with, self-interest leads the masses to a Tragedy Of The Commons strategy where everyone connects to a central hub even though doing so negates the value of the network.  The solution is to counter Tragedy Of The Commons with the Power Of Defaults.
Selecting with whom to open your few channels is a complicated decision.  Even if you are entirely motivated only to improve the robustness of the network, the network is intentionally a giant mess!  There’s no way for a human to make a optimal decision for the network. Throw in some irrational, short-term self-interest and the network goes down the tubes. 
That’s why the *default* is that you leave the decision to an algorithm that works to improve the network. And, in doing so it will work out just fine for you (and very well for everyone in the long term).  In the short term, not being directly connected with your local coffee shop will mean that you pay a negligible extra fee to buy your coffee. But, in the long term you will pay much less fees in general because you and everyone else have created a densely connected mesh with few hops from anyone to anyone.
I stress *default* because, of course, you can manually open channels with anyone you wish.

This is why I expect Neo and especially Lisk to end very badly.  They are extending blockchain programming into languages that are popular without asking if "popular" also implies "useful in this context".  JavaScript is exactly the opposite of what you want use to to write open, hackable, multi-million-dollar contracts.  Frankly, Coq and TLA+ are the *only* languages I consider reasonable for implementing smart contracts.
