There's no way a phone could put out enough power for the signal to travel any reasonable distance.

Probably the most idiotic and pointless "protest" I've seen recently. Hilarious to watch though.

They really are insufferable. The ones on Xbox Live make me wanna bash my skull in.
@_date: 2014-10-04 06:29:34
So you did see something?
@_date: 2014-07-24 06:36:27
It's ruined by the ugly 12-hour clock though. Also I'm pretty sure "iiNet" isn't a thing.

I dunno how many Canadians you've listened to, but it's usually closer to aboat.

I know, I looked it up after I commented. I was obviously joking though.

I don't even know what "moving money for better" is supposed to mean. It doesn't make any sense as a sentence.
@_date: 2015-08-01 00:57:51
That doesn't make sense either though. It's seriously making less and less sense the more I think about it.

That's a lot of effort for not much benefit, unfortunately.

U-verse's authentication protocol only works with equipment provided by AT&amp;T. Their ADSL service worked with third party modems, but their ADSL2 and VDSL don't. You can use a different router and put it into the U-verse router's DMZ though.

To which "that" are you referring?
@_date: 2015-03-29 00:47:48
Hmm, I guess my bank missed that memo.
@_date: 2015-03-28 00:31:37
Heck yeah, I don't have a single bill in my possession right now. It makes more sense to leave it where it can gain some interest.

Your baby ate a bitcoin?

Also, mining with Stratum will consume a lot less bandwidth than GW or GBT. Never use GBT.

Fucking time travel theories.

Hmm, their gunpowder isn't priced too bad, but just about everything else is pretty painful.

Thanks for the reply, but I drink a *lot* of tea so I can only really afford cheaper teas like Davidson's and Coffee Bean Direct. I usually drink green teas, but lately I've been trying white teas which are quite expensive elsewhere (especially silver needle, yikes).

By "real," you mean...?

Stratum, GetWork (GW) and GetBlockTemplate (GBT) are all protocols used for mining with pools. GW is pretty much outdated at this point. GBT and Stratum were designed to support significantly higher hashrate devices (such as ASICs) with minimal bandwidth usage. GBT, however, is mainly meant for solo mining with a local instance of Bitcoin. Stratum is pretty much the best option right now because it uses very little bandwidth and it keeps rejects/stales extremely low.
