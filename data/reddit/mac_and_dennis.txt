I’m here to console you. Bought in at $1980. Sold at $8k. Would be a wealthy person right now if I hadn’t. 
But good news is that my profits went to buying 25 miners :) have done very well with that. 
Bit of advice: if you’ve reached 6 digits in profits, set yourself up an office or warehouse and start mining.

Easy to use. I use it for all my spending money. I dump cash into it that I would normal have for spending.

Remember when everyone said crypto wouldn’t last a year? And then they said 2 years, then 3 years.....
See the pattern here?

As far as the wallet goes, you hold the private keys. 
As far as the debit card, it’s basically a reloadable Visa card. Has a PIN number. 
You only move over the dollar amount from any wallet you want, and it moves it over to the card account. Ready to spend. 
I’ve had zero problems.

Nope. Just set up a wallet with private keys on your phone, if ya have one. Use a paper wallet if not. Just keep it very very safe. 
Maybe have an adult with you since you will be carrying cash. Just to be safe. 
ATMs will have fees though so be prepared for that. My local atm charges 15% for transactions (bitcoins and litecoins)
Ask any more questions you have. I’m new to this also and don’t know much, but I’ll answer whatever I can. 
Also....you must be a mature 11 year old to be interested in having bitcoins. Hold on to them!

The second article isn’t saying to not invest. It’s just saying expect a fall. The smart will buy up as much coin as possible during the fall. I’ve already dumped some cash into bitcoin this morning. Looking for it drop to 3700 if ima buy anymore for this dip. Otherwise, let’s keep moving up!

They are absolutely scammers. They refused to let me have access to $1100 worth of my bitcoin. So I’ve sent them 10+ emails and still nothing. Their only response ever was “there is a hold on your account”
How can their be a hold on a private wallet? That makes no sense but they have done it. 
Never trust BitPay. They are undermining the bitcoin community.

My crypto holding are 99% savings and investments, but I still take out small percentages of growth as it hits certain growth points. For example: Say that my portfolio grows by 20% over the course of a few days. I’ll grab 5% of that and move it over to BitPay. Then I use their linked visa debit card to spend that cash. Literally anywhere visa is accepted which is everywhere. You can go full bitcoin if you really wanted. 
I just purchased a whole new outfit online from LRG from the insane growth from last night. 
I never use my bitcoin for essential bills and needs. I own a business that pays my bills with traditional funds. Crypto is savings/investments/fun money.

AHAHAHA got an email a few minutes after posting this  
Incredible. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:37:16
Thank you so much for responding. I only posted a furious post because I was desperate. I plan to use BitPay as my main way to spend, I just had to do something. Things are chaotic down here. 
Please know that I have no real hard feelings, I just needed a response and this was the only way I knew how at this point. 
Thanks again.

A woman who does thing to be more attractive is exclusively for men to participate in? Are they not allowed to do things for personal reasons?
