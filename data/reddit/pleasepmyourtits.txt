Buy goods/services with it, hodl, or tip new users.  That's a decent amount, so you could easily do all three!  Thanks for participating in this incredible economic experiment!

Will you please add a dollar field when buying coin on your site?  Basically just do the math for me because I buy in terms of USD.

Link?  Please.

Exactly this.  OP, head over to Bitfinex and short BTC.  Crank that leverage and put your money where your keyboard is.

If you can spare 12 minutes, I urge you to please watch [this](  Elected officials are just fallible humans.  A healthy skepticism of the state is critical for a free society.

Holy shit, dude.  Check out [this]( comment you made at the end of 2012.  **Bitcoins were $13 at the time.**  Even after the entire bear market of 2014, you would STILL be sitting on gains of over 3,000% if you would have bought coin then.  I understand this is just your anti-Bitcoin, anti-gun, anti-libertarian, ~~anti-drug~~ trolling account, but you really need to understand that these opinions (real or not) are not aligned with reality.  Bitcoin usage has almost [tripled]( in the past 2 years, [47 states]( allow conceal carry, and the [majority]( of Americans now support legalizing weed.  I get that you can't wrap your head around something as radical as Bitcoin (not many can) but the opinions you type on Reddit are actually the exact opposite from the pro-liberty direction the US is headed.

My biggest fear is mining centralization.  We need to remain vigilant that no pool gets even remotely close to 51%.

FYI: Puny humans like you and I don't get to decide Bitcoin's future.  Cryptocurrency's future will be decided by *humanity.*

No.  You just deposit cash into the seller's account.  They will respond with the account number once you initiate a trade.  You walk into a branch and hand a teller cash.  Be sure to get a receipt.  Chase is the only bank I know of that has banned depositing cash into someone else's account.

Sorry, I'm not finding any particular comment or submission.  If anything, you actually submitted [this]( to I lumped you in with supporting the laws the state enforces.  I apologize.

If quantum computer kicks off, cryptography in general will face many problems.  Bitcoin will be the least of our worries.  Also, Bitcoin is malleable and can be upgraded if (or when) such a threat arises.  More info [here](

Good thing I only transmit transactions through a few VPNs + Tor while stealing my neighbor's wifi.  Come at me, Lawsky.

As far as the [Hype Cycle]( goes, this level of despair really hints at the "Trough of Disillusionment" phase.  Interest is waning as first-gen implementations fail to deliver and the vast majority of businesses drop out of the market.  Now its just a question of how deep we will sink and when/if we will ever pull out.

Thank you, based OP!

Do you feel better about yourself now? I'm glad you felt the need to bring more negativity into the world.
