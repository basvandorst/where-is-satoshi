Cuz it takes time for the money to clear and for Coinbase to release funds is my guess.
Also i have no idea how any of this works and I’d rather buy $1,000 BTC and watch it drop to $600 than spend $100 on a nice steak dinner

So like, does the US government now respect crypto as an actual asset rather than fucking nerd money?
So help make some god damn rules and publicize it so we can moon god damn it.
Tell everyone that bitcoin is considered monetary value and should be treated as such, that it has real value like gold and should be treated as digital gold. It has real value and isn’t rat poison like other old fucks who have no clue push it aside as.
Thanks Uncle  Sam

I read that if you put it into multiple wallets you have more bitcoin. It’s like moving the decimal place to the right or something. Genius

That would be an epic bounce because I think people would fomo the fuck in at $5K. $3K, people are going to start taking out mortgages again

Cash app is pretty much same fee as coinbase but instant if you want to transfer and use it. Coinbase I have to wait like 3 days before I can do anything with it outside of coinbase

Just the organic growth we were expecting. Nothing to see here. Move along folks

Why $1000? Wasn’t it like $4 at one point?

This is how it starts. Gotta begin somewhere!

Can’t believe you paid $1M for that. In 2025 you’ll be kicking yourself 
@_date: 2018-11-04 16:21:26
Real adoption!! Huge. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 23:16:21
So what happens when it doesn’t hit $1M?
Is McAffee going to get every hit man / mafia / gang go chop his weiner?

Was there a video or something that I missed? The article wasn’t bad at all. 
Towards the end they state that Bitcoin has potential, but just isn’t the solution for today.
The internet was super slow and clunky when it first started, and had very rudimentary use cases.
Mobile banking was an application that formed from that eventually, but even then, it didn’t take off initially.
Shit takes time.

What. The. Fuck?  Are you a marketing bot that’s become self-aware? 
@_date: 2019-01-19 15:41:41
Why would they use Bitcoin? Don’t they have their own Pedro coin or petro coin or something?
This makes no sense
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:39:58
Are they gonna have to pay taxes?
