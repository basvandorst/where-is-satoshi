I want to stop using coinbase, but I did like the autobuy feature where I could automatically buy a set amount of bitcoin each month. Are there any other wallets/exchanges that have that?

I always imagined this would be the way to do it. I don't know how much you need the liquidity of USD at any moment, but having your own wallet and displaying the public address would be simplest. You may even be able to make deals with vendors to accept Bitcoin, and then you would never need to bother with converting it to fiat anyway.

That's some great art. You have the best art, of all the art.

It was for an office party with a $15 limit.

I've been seeing a lot of calls for exchanges to implement Segwit, but am a little confused. 
Wasn't most of the community anti-Segwit during the hardfork back in August? Is that what the fork was about? 
Also, I know they are different things, but I remember everyone celebrating when Segwit2x was cancelled. Has the general opinion changed, or am I mistaken? 
Thanks in advance!

He bought the bitcoin months ago. He was able to buy a lot more way back then.

I had a great moment yesterday where I realized how many people still have no idea what this whole bitcoin thing is. At my office white elephant gift exchange, I gave someone a paper wallet containing .001 bitcoin. Nobody knew what it was, and only a handful of the 50 or so people there had even heard of bitcoin. It just reminds me that not everyone in glued to this subreddit, or the price charts on gdax like a lot of us. At this point, if you have any bitcoin, you are an early adopter. There is so much more room for growth.

Is it a bad idea to give someone $10 of bitcoin for a christmas present? Am I just giving them too little that they won't be able to transfer out due to fees? What's a better option?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:29:44
It's up to you. However, be aware of transaction fees. I think Coinbase charges $3.99 per transaction, so you may not want to do too many transactions of a small amount.

I'm sorry, but what does "American Bitcoin ETF" mean?
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:21:24
Sorry, still unsure. So bitcoin withdrawals includes my Gemini bitcoin wallet -&gt; bank account AND my Gemini bitcoin wallet --&gt; someone else's bitcoin wallet?

Hey I think I may have been one such idiot. I was trying to give a friend some bitcoin yesterday, and we each opened up our coinbase apps. When I sent over some money, there was a HUGE transfer fee. Really hurt my argument about how awesome bitcoin is. So, how could I have done this differently? Sorry if I'm being a total noob, but I would appreciate the help. Thanks.

Sorry for the noob question, but what does it take to be part of a mining pool? Can I use my basic laptop, or would I need a more serious specific set up?
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:33:33
Sorry if this is a stupid question, but I was wondering about hardware wallets. If I have bitcoin stored on a Trezor or Ledger, what would happen if those companies go out of business? Right now I need to have the Ledger app on my computer to deposit/withdraw coins. Should I be worried about a scenario where I can't access that app? Thanks in advance!

That's beautiful

What's the best way to exchange bcash for other cryptocurrencies? I would rather not exchange it for USD, and then buy with that. Is there a good exchange, that I can access from US, that allows direct buy and sell between coins?
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:57:50
Is that all easy to do on mobile? I transferred some bitcoin to a friend last night, just using the coinbase app (because that's what he had) and the transaction fee was ridiculous. Really hurt my argument about how awesome bitcoin is.

Can someone fill me in? Was most of the community anti-Segwit during the hardfork back in August? Is that what the fork was about? I remember everyone celebrating when Segwit2x was cancelled. Has the general opinion changed, or am I mistaken? Thanks in advance. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:16:58
That's for withdrawals? Does that include sending to another bitcoin address? Or just for withdrawing for USD?
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:32:20
Awesome! I'd love one!
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:05:53
What's the best exchange to use to send bitcoins to a friend? Just using coinbase between two parties had crazy high fees.

It's always better to be safer with a wallet. As much as we all hope something like Mt. Gox won't happen again, it's possible. When the coins are held (hedl?) on an exchange, they belong to the exchange, not to you.

I want to do this, but am unsure how. I apologize, but can someone help me out? I had all my bitcoin in coinbase for almost a year, until about 6 weeks ago when I transferred almost all of it to a ledger wallet. Where is my bcash? How do I access it? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:48:20
On GDAX I see buy and sell, but not transfer to another wallet. Am I just not seeing it?
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:22:54
Finally found away to access my bcash. What do you think? Sell now to buy more bitcoin? Sell half? Invest in other cryptos?
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:50:01
Okay, I see it. Wow my bad. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:47:19
I held bitcoin on the Blockchain app on August 1st. I've sinced moved them. Where / how can I get my bcash? Just planning to sell it for bitcoin, but don't want to just lose it.
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:42:22
Hey sorry for the noob question, but can you help me out here? I appreciate your help. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:07:09
I'm guessing you accept Bitcoin at your store?
